Sadulaev became the 2014 World Champion in the 86 kg class at age 18, and Olympic champion at age 20.\n\nHe was undefeated in competition from November 2013 until August 2017. In 2014, Sadulaev was considered by many to be the most dominant wrestler in the world. In August 2016, Sadulaev was the #1 ranked 86 kg competitor in the world, and was ranked as the #1 Pound-for-Pound wrestler in the world by Flo Wrestling.\n\nSadulaev was born in 1996 in the village of Tsurib, Charodinsky District, Dagestan, Russia. He belongs to the Avar ethnic group, he is from a devout Sunni Muslims family and is the youngest of four siblings. He did not start wrestling professionally until the age of 13, but quickly won a regional title and 300 ₽ ($4.69). After finishing the 11th grade, he began training in the Gamid Gamidov Wrestling club in Makhachkala, Dagestan's sports school of Olympic reserve. When he was 15 years old, he won the Cadet Freestyle Wrestling World Championships. Sadulaev only has two social networking accounts, on instagram and on vk. He stated that as he has no account on Twitter, other accounts existing there using his identity must be fake.\n\nSadulaev's senior level debut was at the XLIII Ali Aliyev Memorial when he was 16 years old. He was defeated in the semifinals by Shamil Kudiyamagomedov, but ended up winning the bronze medal. At the 2014 Russian National Championships, Sadulaev defeated Kudiyamagomedov and won his first national title. After the Russian Nationals, he participated at the 2014 World Wrestling Championships, where Sadulaev defeated Reineris Salas of Cuba 11–0 by technical fall.\n\nOn 8 May 2015, Sadulaev won the Russian Freestyle Wrestling Nationals again and took part in the European Games in Baku, Azerbaijan, and World Championships in Las Vegas, Nevada. In the Games he outscored four opponents 42–1 (4–0) by technical fall and won gold medal. On 11 September 2015, he won World Championships, in the final knocking down Koloi Kartoev (Selim Yaşar) of Turkey, overall scoring 47–2 (6–0) in the championships. As a result he was given a Mercedes-Benz G-Class G63 and Toyota Land Cruiser 200 by Dagestani business magnate Gadzhiev brothers and Ziyavudin Magomedov.\n\nSadulaev faced on 7 November wrestlers from Belarus, Turkey, Azerbaijan, Georgia and Poland at the European Nations Cup (Alrosa Cup). He beat number one Georgian wrestler Elizbar Odikadze via technical fall (11–0).\n\nOn 29 January, Sadulaev was expected to participate at the international tournament Golden Grand-Prix Ivan Yarygin 2016, but he pulled out in late January citing a minor shoulder injury.\n\nSadulaev returned to wrestling in the U23 European Championships in Ruse, Bulgaria on 3 April, and then he participated at the Wenceslas Ziolkowski Memorial XXV on 18 June 2016. At the European Championships he defeated Stefan Reichmuth of Switzerland in the eightfinals, Hungarian Gergely Gyrits in the quarterfinals, Belarussian Aliaksandr Hushtyn in the semifinals and finally Georgian Irakli Mtsituri; all victories were by technical superiority. On 18 June, Sadulaev won the Wenceslas Ziolkowski Memorial LII, beating Aleksey Mushtin, teammate Omargadzhi Magomedov, István Veréb of Hungary, Sebastian Jezierzanski and Zbigniew Baranowski, both from Poland, by technical superiority.\n\nSadulaev competed at the 2016 Summer Olympics without Russian Olympic Trials, that news was announced by the head coach of the Russian freestyle wrestling team Dzhambolat Tedeyev. Sadualev beat István Veréb by technical superiority, then Pedro Ceballos of Venezuela by points, fellow countryman Sharif Sharifov of Azerbaijan and in the gold medal match Selim Yasar, 5–0.\n\nAfter Sadulaev's return to Russia, he was greeted by a rowdy welcome victory in Moscow. The Olympic athletes were also given a reception of the Russian medalists in the Kremlin, with the traditional ceremonial meeting being presided by President Vladimir Putin. The champions received BMW luxury crossovers, with the BMW X6 luxury crossovers being awarded for the gold medalists. Sadulaev was also greeted as a national hero in his native Dagestan. Aside from receiving financial reward for his Olympic achievements, Dagestan's Head of the Region Ramazan Abdulatipov presented Sadulaev an Akhal-Teke horse (native to Turkmenistan), which has a reputation for having speed, endurance and intelligence, and is highly valued in Dagestan.\n\nSadulaev competed in the Russian Nationals, defeating 2011 European runner-up Vladislav Baitcaev by decision (8–7). Sadulaev became the new Russian national champion in the 97 kg weight category. Before the final match he easily beat Yuri Belonovskiy, Umar Kudliev, Stanislav Gadzhiev and Tamerlan Rasuev by technical superiority. As a result, Ingushetian president Yunus-bek Yevkurov bestowed him a Toyota Land Cruiser 200.\n\nAt the World Championships, Sadulaev participated in the 97 kg weight category. En route he defeated Reineris Salas, Mateusz Filipczak, Elizbar Odikadze and Georgy Ketoyev. In the final he lost to Kyle Snyder in a close match. It was his first loss since 2013.\n\nAfter that he debuted in the weight category 92 kg at the Golden Grand Prix Ivan Yarygin 2018. In the final match, he beat 2012 Olympic Champion and countryman Anzor Urishev. At the European Championships he defeated his teammate Sharif Sharifov of Azerbaijan in the final match.\n\nOn 3 August 2018, Sadulaev won his fourth national title at the Russian Nationals, knocking down Vladislav Baitcaev for gold by score (8–1).\n\nSadulaev was chosen to represent Russia in his weight class for the World Championships in Budapest, Hungary, facing countrymen Magomedgadzhi Nurov, Mamed Ibragimov, Magomed Ibragimov, who he all beat by technical fall. In the semi-final he defeated Elizbar Odikadze from Georgia, and in the final in a rematch he faced American Kyle Snyder, quickly knocking him down by fall.\n\n\n! Res.\n! Record\n! Opponent\n! Score\n! Date\n! Event\n! Location\n\nOn June 2015, Sadulaev was voted best Russian sportsman of June at the TV project \"Golden Pedestal\" (on the now-defunct Rossiya 2), earning 55,6 % of votes and trumping Aliya Mustafina, who got 44,4 % of votes.\n\n"}
{"id": "51417193", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=51417193", "title": "Alice Diamond", "text": "Alice Diamond\n\nAlice Diamond (22 June 1896 - 1952) was an English career criminal, linked to organised shoplifting.\n\nDiamond was born Alice Elizabeth Black in Lambeth Workhouse Hospital to Thomas Diamond and Mary Ann Alice Blake. Her parents had applied for a maternity birth under the name of Black before they married to avoid the stigma of an illegitimate birth. However, as they married shortly before Alice was born, this also avoided the problem.\n\nAlice's father Thomas Diamond had at least three criminal convictions, including one for assaulting the son of the Lord Mayor of London at a political meeting by punching his head through a pane of glass in a door, severely injuring him. Alice's mother was born Mary Geary and took the name Blake when her parents married. She added Ann and Alice to her name at random times. Alice was the eldest of seven children, a younger sister Louisa also joined the Forty Thieves gang of which Alice Diamond had become leader and given the title Queen of the Forty Thieves and, later, Queen of the Forty Elephants, because of their connection to the streets around the Elephant and Castle district of southeast London. A brother, Tommy, became one of the notorious Elephant and Castle gang.\n\nAlice's criminal career began in 1912 when she was cautioned, along with Mary Austin, who would later marry north London racing gangster Frederick Sabini, for stealing chocolate. A number of convictions for theft followed and in 1915 she was named by police and newspapers as Queen of the Forty Thieves, successor to Mary 'Polly' Carr, who had previously held the title.\n\nAlice had taken over leadership of a large and expert gang of organised shoplifters. She was a skillful organiser of large expeditions across the West End of London and spread her enterprise to the provinces when London became 'hot'. Her chief lieutenant was volatile and violent Maggie Hill, born Margaret Lily Hill into a criminal north London family that one day would produce Billy Hill, dubbed 'Boss of Britain's Underworld'.\n\nAlthough Alice, Maggie and other Elephants served prison terms, they believed the risk was worth it - the alternative being a life of poverty. The gang was known for its stylish dress and wild partying. They could 'put on the posh' and take goods valued at hundreds of pounds from prestigious stores by using specialist garments and clever distraction techniques. Their favourite plunder was fur coats and bolts of silk which were expensive commodities between the World Wars. They were known to drive fast cars and could be violent when confronted. Alice Diamond was over five-foot eight-inches in height at a time when the average height for a man was five-foot six-inches. She wore diamond rings on the fingers of both hands and could deliver a punch a man would have envied. Another of the Forty Elephants was Lilian Goldstein, née Kendall, who was also a driver for smash and grab raider Ruby Sparks, tagged by press and police as 'The Bobbed-Haired Bandit'.\n\nAlice never married, but had a relationship with Bert McDonald, one of the leaders of the Elephant Gang. Maggie Hill married long-term criminal Alfred Hughes. Alice Diamond died at 11 Marnock House, Southwark, close to 'East Lane' market, in 1952.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "341087", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=341087", "title": "Bender (Futurama)", "text": "Bender (Futurama)\n\nBender Bending Rodríguez (designated in-universe as Bending Unit 22, unit number 1,729, serial number 2716057) is a fictional character who is one of the main characters in the animated television series \"Futurama\". He was created by series creators Matt Groening and David X. Cohen and is voiced by John DiMaggio. He fulfills a comic, antihero-type role in \"Futurama\" and is described by fellow character Leela as an \"alcoholic, whore-mongering, chain-smoking gambler\".\n\nAccording to the character's backstory, Bender was built in Tijuana, Mexico (the other characters refer to his \"swarthy Latin charm\"). Viewers are informed, through his own testimony, of Bender's prejudice against non-robots. For example, one of his signature expressions is \"kill all humans\". Exceptions who are not subject to Bender's prejudicial attitude are those individuals on his \"Do Not Kill\" list, which seems to comprise only his best friend Philip J. Fry and his colleague Hermes Conrad (Hermes is added after the episode \"Lethal Inspection\"). However, Bender is also occasionally portrayed as possessing a sympathetic side, suggesting that he is not as belligerent as he claims, a view often echoed by his friends.\n\nBender, a high-tech industrial metalworking robot, was built in 2996 at Fábrica Robótica De La Madre (Spanish: \"Mom's Robot Factory\"), a manufacturing facility of Mom's Friendly Robot Company in Tijuana, Mexico. However, the story of his construction remains a mystery. Although different creation processes have been shown, Cohen has stated that the viewer has only been shown Bender emerging from the machine that created him, while what happened inside the machine has not yet been revealed. According to one version, suggested by Hermes' flashback, and also by a reverse aging process shown in the episode \"Teenage Mutant Leela's Hurdles\", a newborn Bender possessed a baby-like body. In \"Bendless Love\", however, Bender is portrayed with a normal, adult-sized body in a flashback sequence conveying his memory of coming into existence. As Bender's memory contains an adult form, the episode's content suggests that the character might actually be recalling a transfer to an adult body, rather than the moment of creation.\n\nUnlike most other robots, Bender is mortal and, according to Professor Farnsworth's calculations, may have less than one billion years to live. Because of a manufacturing error that left Bender without a backup unit, Bender's memory cannot be transferred or uploaded to another robot body. After reporting that defect to his manufacturer, Bender barely escapes death from a guided missile and a robot death squad dispatched by Mom in order to eliminate him and effectively take the defective product off the market.\n\nAt the factory, Bender was programmed for cold-bending structural steel. Bender later attended Bending State University, where he majored in bending and minored in Robo-American Studies. At the university, he was a member of Epsilon Rho Rho (ERR), a robot fraternity, where he became something of a fraternity hero for his many shenanigans: one night he chugged an entire keg of beer, streaked across campus, and stuffed 58 people into a telephone booth (although he concedes they were mostly children).\n\nBefore meeting Fry and Leela and joining Planet Express (where he currently works as the assistant manager of sales). Bender had a job at the metalworking factory, bending steel girders for the construction of suicide booths.\n\nBender has an apartment in the \"Robot Arms Apts.\" building, where he eventually invites his best friend and coworker, Fry, to live with him. Although the pair enjoy living together, Bender is sometimes portrayed as manipulating his guileless friend. In the series' early episodes, Bender is shown preferring to occupy smaller areas of their apartment, like the closet, referring to them as \"cozy\", although in later episodes he is shown to have his own individual bedroom, like Fry.\n\nThroughout the series, he enters many romantic relationships of varying duration, and is commonly referred to as a womanizer by his friends. He does not seem to discriminate between human women and their robot or \"fem-bot\" counterparts, and is shown actively pursuing both. Likewise, his taste in fem-bot partners does not seem to be affected by the fem-bot's height or weight, and he is shown numerous times chasing fem-bots of all builds. In \"Proposition Infinity\", Bender's secret affair with coworker Amy Wong leads to a referendum that, once approved, legalizes robosexuality. In \"The Bots and the Bees\", he has a sexual encounter with a fem-bot soda vending machine that leads to the almost-instantaneous birth of a son, whom he names Ben, after the first part of his own name.\n\nBender hates magnets and has a near-pathological fear of electric can openers, as magnets cause him to uncontrollably start singing folk songs when near his head; magnets shut off his inhibition, causing him to reveal his secret ambition to be a folk singer. He is once able to attach a magnetic small faux-beard underneath his mouth without breaking into song.\n\nThe name \"Bender\" was chosen by series creator Matt Groening in homage to the character John Bender from \"The Breakfast Club\".\n\nBender's visual design went through multiple changes before reaching its final state. One of the decisions which Groening found to be particularly difficult was whether Bender's head should be square or round. Initially he worked under the idea that all robots would have square heads in the year 3000; however, it was later decided that Bender's head should be round, a visual play on the idea that Bender is a \"round peg in a square hole\".\n\nWhen casting for \"Futurama\", Bender's voice was the most difficult to cast, in part because the show's creators had not yet decided what robots should sound like. Because of this, every voice actor who auditioned, no matter for what role, was also asked to read for Bender. After about 300 auditions, even series co-creator Cohen attempted to audition after being told he sounded like a robot. John DiMaggio was eventually chosen for the role after his second audition.\n\nDiMaggio originally auditioned using his Bender voice for the role of Professor Farnsworth and used a voice later used for URL the police robot for Bender.\nHe describes the voice he got the part with as a combination of a sloppy drunk, Slim Pickens, and a character one of his college friends created named \"Charlie the sausage-lover\". Casting directors liked that he made the character sound like a drunk, rather than an automaton. DiMaggio has noted that he had difficulty singing as Bender in \"Hell Is Other Robots\" because he was forced to sing the harmony part in a low key.\n\nBender's factory-set height is 5 ft. 6 in. (168 cm); 6 ft. (183 cm) including his antenna. In \"The Farnsworth Parabox\", Bender states that he flipped a coin to decide his color, ending up with foghat gray rather than gold. In \"The Cyber House Rules\", Bender shows the kids a black-and-white mug shot of himself taken after his arrest for theft. In \"Time Keeps on Slippin'\", Bender is shown trying to join a basketball team and makes himself taller by simply extending his legs. His body has a \"shiny metal ass\", two legs, two \"Extens-o-matic\" arms with three fingers each, a head with two replaceable eyes shaped like light-emitting diodes, and a mouth used for fuel intake and voice communication. In \"Bender Gets Made\", Bender claims he also has a nose, but he chooses not to wear it. Bender's human-like characteristics are reinforced by his display of behaviors often regarded as exclusive to humans, such as whistling, snoring, having bloodshot eyes, crying, feeling physical attraction, being tickled, dreaming, and belching.\n\nOther bending units of the same model as Bender, such as Flexo, share the same hardware design, but differ in terms of their personality and behavior. For example, Flexo shows personality traits similar to those of Bender but is not quite as \"evil\" as Bender. In the episode \"Mother's Day\", Leela looks through a simulation of a bending unit's sight, which targets potential rubes and then denotes a plan to rob them and leave them in a ditch, implying that all bending robots are somewhat prone to theft and amoral by design. However, another unit, Billy West (named after the series voice actor of the same name), is helpful and kind, though he lives as a farmer on the Moon and insists on not being a bending unit.\n\nBender's serial number, 2716057, can be expressed as the sum of two cubes, which is humorous to Bender and Flexo after Flexo reveals that his serial number has the same characteristic (also, Bender’s designation 1729 is a taxicab number).\n\nBender was designed specifically for the relatively simple task of bending straight metal girders into various angles. Despite this apparent simplicity, he possesses numerous features superfluous to his original purpose, which become more apparent after an electric jolt to his antenna from an overhead light socket in the pilot episode. The scope of Bender's functionality is impressive; he often acts as if he were a multifunctional gadget rather than a special bending machine. Similar to a contemporary computer, he hosts a number of input/output devices: his head has a data socket and remotely operated volume control. His body has a socket for a microphone jack, a dual-socket power receptacle, a reset button, a kill switch, and a self-destruct button. Having the hardware-based self-destruct control on his body, rather than in his software, prevents Bender from committing suicide in \"A Head in the Polls\" when he pawns everything but his head, grows desperate without it and desires to kill himself.\n\nBender is capable of disassembling and reassembling his body at will and operating each detached body part individually and remotely, presumably by using his transmitter and antenna to send wireless signals. His head can be used for a wide range of functions, whether attached to his body or not. In one episode, Leela reassembles Bender into a functioning go-kart.\n\nBender uses his chest cavity as a locker, which seems to store much more than is physically possible; it is often used to store heads in jars, small children, alcohol, money, loot, the world's last darkroom, and, on a few occasions, Fry. In \"The Route of All Evil\", the cavity was also used as a boil kettle, hopback and fermentation tank to produce home-made beer. Upon inspection of his body, it appears to be empty, though devices like the F-Ray reveal that, despite appearing hollow, Bender's body contains gears and other robotic components.\n\nBeing an electronic machine, he can perform quick mathematical calculations, but admits to being a poor calculator.\n\nAs a bending unit, Bender possesses extraordinary strength, which he often demonstrates by lifting heavy objects, smashing through walls, and even bending an enormous steel girder marked \"UNBENDABLE\" (in \"Bendless Love\"). His mechanical nature also makes him far more durable than the rest of the cast, capable of surviving gunfire, explosions, extreme heat, deep water, or hard vacuum.\n\nEven when his body is seemingly destroyed or completely detached from his head, it has no effect on Bender's ability to think and communicate, indicating that his main processing facilities are located in his head. Bender's hardware is controlled by a factory-loaded operating system, which reboots upon incidental shutdown and automatically adjusts its settings to the environment detected at the time of rebooting. For example, in \"The Birdbot of Ice-Catraz\", when Bender reboots, his visual sensors detect a colony of penguins, prompting his boot loader to re-initialize him with penguin-like behavior and language.\n\nHe is equipped with a vast capacity of computer data storage, in excess of 100,001 terabytes- 1 TB for general storage and 100,000 TB for the storage of pornography, though in 6ACV25 Cubert Farnsworth deletes 12 TB of outdated catchphrases from Bender. Presumably either Bender has a separate \"catchphrase drive\" or the majority of the catchphrases are also pornographic.\n\nBender is powered by alcohol-based fuels, which he can convert into an electrical power source sufficient to operate not only himself, but also small household appliances plugged into his power receptacle. Low alcohol intake levels decrease his production of electricity: when he stops drinking and begins to \"sober\", his behavior grows increasingly ebrious and dysfunctional, and he grows a red beard of rust. He is also, apparently, able to sustain himself by consuming mineral oil, though he considers this to be only 'functional'.\n\nDue to Professor Farnsworth's flawed design, the energy conversion process inside Bender's body produces an inordinate amount of waste gases and heat. He can expel these products from his rear end or, more often, as a flaming belch.\n\nHe also has a nuclear pile inside his body, as seen in \"Godfellas\". However its location and purpose are not clear.\n\nBender often exhibits sociopathic behavior; he is a pathological liar and rarely shows any empathy (his most frequent catchphrase to any bothersome person is \"Bite my shiny metal ass!\"). He has a mostly voluntary morality and constantly steals, ranging from the petty theft of wallets to crimes such as kidnapping Jay Leno's head and stealing Fry's blood and kidney. He also once stole Amy's earrings while giving her a hug. It was shown in \"Roswell That Ends Well\" that even in a disassembled state, his individual limbs carry on attempting to steal anything in proximity; the hand on his dismembered arm steals a wallet out of a scientist's pocket before becoming inactive again.\n\nHe is shown throughout the series as having a secret desire to be a folk musician that only manifests itself when a magnet is placed on or near his head. This desire is finally fulfilled in the episode \"Bendin' in the Wind\": an accident involving a giant can opener leaves him with a mutilated chest and paralyzed from the neck down. An encounter with Beck during his hospitalization leads to his becoming lead washboard player and the two teaming up for a musical tour that turns Bender into a folk hero for other broken robots, only for his career to end when he finally recovers.\n\nHe is also fascinated with cooking, being the chef of the \"Planet Express Ship\", though he is shown to have no sense of actual taste. In fact, his early dinners were so horrible that even the omnivorous Zoidberg could not eat it. In his first attempt, he creates a dinner for the crew that is so over-salted they all gag (which is aggravated further when their drinks turn out to be \"salt with water in them\"); he then remarks that the food was fine since the salt content was 10% below a lethal dose. In \"The Problem with Popplers\", he creates dinner consisting of nothing but capers and baking soda, and mistakenly expresses his belief that humans eat rocks. He seems to improve his cooking skills over the series, cooking a lavish cake for Nibbler's birthday party and beating Elzar for the title of Iron Cook (though he uses a potion called \"The Essence of Pure Flavor\", which consists of water and a generous portion of LSD to make the judges hallucinate that his food tastes good). In \"Into the Wild Green Yonder\", he mistakenly bakes prison guards a cake with nutmeg thinking it was a natural human sleep drug, before being corrected by Amy that nutmeg is in fact a baking ingredient.\n\nAs a robot, he possesses an incredible amount of patience. In \"Roswell That Ends Well\", he is shown to wait over a thousand years in sand after his head is lost during a trip back in time to 1947, as well as many thousands of years in subterranean caverns under New New York City (although on this occasion he was also in the presence of multiple alternate versions of himself that had previously made the same 'trip'). Despite the long wait, it is implied that Bender does not power down, apparently enjoying his own company so much that he does not consider it necessary. However, in one episode, he shows next to no patience as a one-time joke.\n\nAlthough the consumption of alcohol is necessitated by Bender's design and should not be generally viewed as a vice for alcohol-fueled robots, he apparently drinks far more than he needs for energy. His excessive drinking contributes to his characterization as an alcoholic (\"Hell Is Other Robots\" reveals that robots can function equally well on mineral oil instead of alcohol, also contributing to the perception of Bender's alcohol use as a vice). If he is deprived of alcohol, for instance during periods of depression, he ceases to function properly and shows signs similar to human drunkenness, including developing a rusty five o'clock shadow. As noted above, his disembodied head has survived for millennia with, presumably, no source of alcohol, so it may be that, when a mere head, Bender neither requires alcohol nor suffers from its absence.\n\nWhen he is sufficiently frightened or sickened, bricks fall from his backside (a reference to the slang \"shitting bricks\"). When sufficiently fascinated by something, he may pull out a camera and snap a picture, adding the catchphrase \"Neat!\". He has also been shown to be able to use his eyes as cameras. In addition to drinking, he also has an affinity for cigars, which he ignites with a lighter built into his finger, although in \"Decision 3012\" he uses a Zippo. Unlike drinking alcohol for fuel, Bender tells Fry that he smokes cigars simply because they \"make [him] look cool\".\n\nDespite being a robot, he has been seen to show emotion on many occasions, going so far as to shed a tear in \"Crimes of the Hot\", to Fry's astonishment. One of the series' running jokes revolves around Bender having emotions, when technically he should be an unfeeling machine. Bender is seemingly unaware of his emotions, stating in the episode \"Anthology of Interest II\" \"I mean, being a robot's great but we don't have emotions and sometimes that makes me very sad\". In his very first appearance, he tries to commit suicide via a suicide booth out of guilt for having unknowingly contributed to their creation. He has also been known to be nonchalant to the point of appearing both uncaring and incredibly brave, even in life-threatening situations.\n\nBender is a classic narcissist. He considers himself flawless, a \"towering inferno of physical perfection\", and refers to himself in both the first and third person. In \"The Farnsworth Parabox\" Bender seemingly falls in love with an alternate gold-plated version of himself, stating that he has finally found someone \"as great as me\". Even his personal email address, <nowiki>bender@ilovebender.com</nowiki>, reflects his self-absorbed nature.\n\nDespite these human characteristics, he has no verifiable soul, as seen in \"Obsoletely Fabulous\" when he passes through a \"soul detector\" without setting off the alarm. However, in \"Ghost in the Machines\", Bender becomes a ghost who can't interact with people directly but can possess machinery: he uses this ability to \"scare Fry to death\". He eventually makes a deal with the Robot Devil to get a new body. (Though never addressed in-universe, this seeming contradiction, as noted by the Robot Devil himself, may result from the distinction that Bender's \"spirit\" exists in a universal wireless network that allows him to travel in the physical world while trapped in a Limbo-like loop. The conclusion that his ghost is an incorporeal program rather than a soul is further supported by the fact that the \"spirits\" in \"The Honking\" are actually holograms of deleted computer folders.)\n\nHis relationships with the rest of the crew of Planet Express vary over time, although he treats nearly all biological organisms with disdain. The only one of his friends who he has openly shown affection for is Fry, his best friend and roommate. \"Of all the friends I've had, [he is] the first.\" Although he is verbally and physically abusive towards Fry and considers him to be vastly inferior to him, he has been shown to care for him a great deal. In \"Jurassic Bark\" he states that he loves Fry \"the way a human loves a dog\", and in \"I Second That Emotion\" when Bender gets jealous of Nibbler and flushes him down the toilet, a distraught Leela asks how he would feel if she did the same to Fry, describing Fry as Bender's pet (Bender responds with an apathetic \"Only one way to find out.\"). He routinely takes advantage of his friends, including framing them for crimes, robbing them, stealing Fry's blood on more than one occasion, stealing Fry's power of attorney, using Fry's body to smash open a window, taking Fry's kidney and trying to sell it (it eventually gets eaten by Leela), and stealing jewelry from Amy. He is prone to using Zoidberg in various get-rich-quick schemes, although it is probable he does not consider Dr. Zoidberg a friend, since in \"Obsoletely Fabulous\" Bender begged the 1X Robot to \"save (his) friends, and Zoidberg\" (Though it is seen that he helps Zoidberg from time to time, as seen in \"That's Lobstertainment!\"). He even betrays Leela to Zapp Brannigan in \"Into the Wild Green Yonder\" when she becomes a wanted criminal, out of jealousy of her steadily growing rap sheet, only to break her out of prison again to ensure his own sheet remains lengthier. Although he regularly frustrates the crew, they have demonstrated a certain affection for him in return. During \"How Hermes Requisitioned His Groove Back\", the entire crew traveled to the Central Bureaucracy to recover his brain after Morgan Proctor burned it onto a floppy disk and sent it away. Hermes Conrad subsequently risks his bureaucratic license to locate the disc with Bender's brain on it by sorting the entire pile in just under four minutes. In the same episode, when Amy asked why they had to fix him, after being met with a brief period of uncertain silence, Leela responded with \"Those arguments aside, we're still going.\" Amy and Bender date for a time in \"Proposition Infinity\"; the relationship becomes so serious that Bender proposes to Amy and participates in a campaign to legalize human/robot marriage, although the relationship ends after he realizes that such marriage rights would necessitate monogamy.\n\nDespite his often immoral attitude, he does not lack a soft side; he can feel guilt and remorse over his actions if he goes too far (even by his own standards), indicating that he is not as selfish or unkind as he appears to be. In \"Bendless Love\", Bender intends to murder Flexo in order to gain the love of fem-bot Angelyne, but when Flexo gets stuck under a gigantic steel girder, Angelyne shows sorrow for him. Bender decides that her happiness is more important than his own, and ends up saving Flexo. Also, in \"Jurassic Bark\", when Bender becomes jealous of Fry's petrified dog, Seymour, he decides to throw him in magma. But when he realizes how Fry becomes deeply hurt, Bender apologizes for his behavior and rescues the dog. In \"Godfellas\", he becomes the god of a microscopic alien race and abuses this position by commanding them to produce beer for him. When his abuse of power causes the entire species' demise, however, he cries in mourning and remorse.\n\nIn 2008, Bender took second place behind the Terminator in a poll for the \"Baddest Movie Robot\" on Techradar.com.\n\nThe song \"Bend It Like Bender!\" from the Devin Townsend Project album \"Addicted\", is a direct reference to Bender and contains the quote \"Game's over, losers! I have all the money!\"\n\nBeing the show's breakout character, Bender has made several cameos in different episodes of \"The Simpsons\", another series by Matt Groening. Within \"The Simpsons\", Bender has appeared in episodes \"Future-Drama\", \"Bart vs. Lisa vs. the Third Grade\", \"\" and \"Replaceable You\". Bender has also makes a cameo appearance in Matt Groening's latest series \"Disenchantment\", in the episode \"Dreamland Falls\".\n\nIn the \"Simpsons\"-\"Futurama\" crossover episode \"Simpsorama\", Bender travels back in time in the 31st century to Springfield to kill Homer Simpson, whose DNA is tied to the creatures rampaging in the 31st century. Bender ends up befriending Homer before learning that the creatures are in fact Bart's genetic offspring. Once the crisis is averted, Bender goes into shutdown mode in the Simpsons' basement. Bender was still resting inert in the Simpsons' basement as of 2015 episode \"Cue Detective\" in which his empty body cavity was used to store the family's cash nest-egg. Bender also makes a background cameo appearance in the \"Simpsons\" episode \"My Fare Lady\", holding a shovel and bucket at the end of Homer's dream about \"The Jetsons\".\n\nBender, along with Professor Farnsworth and Fry, appear in the season finale of \"Disenchantment\" as a hologram from a crystal ball, within the one-way time machine from the \"Futurama\" episode \"The Late Philip J. Fry\".\n\nHe also appears as one of the enemies, along with Doctor Zoidberg, in \"The Simpsons Game\".\n\nBender makes cameo appearances in several \"Family Guy\" episodes. In \"Blue Harvest\" he can be seen at the Mos Eisley cantina, and in \"The Splendid Source\", he is one of the repeaters of a dirty joke whose original author Peter Griffin, Joe Swanson, and Glenn Quagmire are seeking. In the episode \"Boopa-dee Bappa-dee\", Peter attempts to use the guide on the television remote, turning Stewie Griffin into a host of past and present Animation Domination characters, including Bender.\n"}

The monument was destroyed in December 2002.\n\nThe bust bore the likeness of Ferdinand Marcos, President of the Philippines from 1965 to 1986. The inside of the bust was hollow. The bust measured high and was made of concrete.\n\nAround 1978, the bust's construction began along Marcos Highway, which was later officially renamed Aspiras–Palispis Highway. The bust was constructed by the Philippine Tourism Authority and was meant to be the centerpiece of Marcos Park. The bust was positioned near the peak of Mt. Shontoug so it could be seen by Baguio-bound motorists as far as away from the monument. Father and son, Anselmo Dayag Sr. and Anselmo Jr. were chosen to design the bust but the former died due to disease. Scaffolding covered with plywood was reportedly erected to deliberately hide the bust's construction from the public. A typhoon later blew the scaffolding away, exposing the bust. The Ibaloi were said to have been displaced due to the bust's construction. It was reported that they were forced to sell their lands for outrageously low prices. The bust was completed around 1980.\n\nAfter the People Power Revolution of 1986, the Ibaloi slaughtered a pig and carabao and poured the animals' blood into the bust to \"exorcise\" it and later filed a case to reclaim their land.\n\nThe bust was bombed in 1989 by leftist rebels and sustained cracks and other minor damage.\n\nThe bust was subjected to controversy and was viewed as self-glorification, especially by critics of the Marcos administration. The Ibalois viewed it as a symbol of their mistrust for government authorities since the construction of the bust displaced them from their lands. Communist insurgents also criticized the bust's construction, and many groups planned to destroy the bust.\n\nThe bust was destroyed using dynamite before dawn on December 29, 2002 by suspected treasure hunters who thought that the bust contained parts of the rumored Yamashita treasure. Benguet Governor Raul Mencio Molintas said that the police learned that a white Toyota FX van was around the area prior to the incident. It was initially thought that the New People's Army was behind the bombing of the monument. The rebel group's Chadli Molintas Command claimed responsibility for the incident in a press release a day later. The communists said that the bust's mere existence \"is a mockery of justice and a betrayal of the will of the people. ... Let the ruins be an ugly reminder that the Marcoses have yet to pay for their crimes.\"\n\nSome critics of Marcos criticized the destruction of the monument. Archbishop Oscar Cruz of Lingayen-Dagupan said that the perpetrators \"should have never destroyed the monument to evil in this country\", describing the bust as \"a monument to evil, warning people never to become what this man was\".\n\nIn 2003, Baguio city mayor Ramon Labo Jr. made an offer to the Marcos family to restore the bust. Imelda Marcos, the wife of Ferdinand Marcos (who died in exile in 1989), took the offer as a \"kind gesture\" but said that efforts to fix the monument should be a \"collective decision of the Marcoses and their supporters\". Ferdinand Marcos Jr., the son of the former president, said that restoring the bust was never a subject of discussion among the family.\n"}

His father left the family, and Carl went to sea around 1892, at about the age of 17. Later, around 1898, he ended up in the Bismarck Archipelago of German New Guinea, where he worked for the German trading house, Neuguinea-Compagnie, headquartered in Kokopo. \n\nOn a recruiting trip in the Pacific, Pettersson's vessel, the \"Herzog Johan Albrecht\" (\"Duke Johan Albrecht\") sank on Christmas Day 1904, off Tabar Island in New Ireland Province. He was washed ashore near a village and landed in a hibiscus hedge, where he was immediately surrounded by islanders. Cannibalism was not uncommon in those times and although Pettersson was uncommonly strong, he would not have been a match for them. The islanders carried him to their king, and the king's daughter fell in love with him. In 1907 he married Princess Singdo, the daughter of the local king, Lamy. He got a start in the copra trade and managed to create his own coconut plantation that he called Teripax. He became king after the death of his father in law. His nickname among the locals was \"Strong Charley\", and he was indeed famed for his physical strength. Swedish newspapers printed a series of stories about Pettersson and his adventures.\n\nBusiness went well and he increased his estate with two plantations, first Maragon on Simberi Island and later Londolovit on Lihir Group islands. Pettersson was respectful of local customs and showed concern for his employees, which was unusual at the time. He was therefore very popular with the locals. His marriage with Singdo produced a family of nine children, one of whom died in infancy. His wife died in 1921 of puerperal fever.\n\nIn 1922, Pettersson travelled to Sweden, partly to look for a new wife who could look after his children. There, he also visited his old friend Birger Mörner whom he had met in the South Pacific. He then met Anglo-Swedish Jessie Louisa Simpson; together they returned to Tabar Island, where they married in 1923. In Petterson's absence the plantation had declined, and he was now close to bankruptcy. Additionally, he and his wife both suffered from malaria. He painstakingly rebuilt his plantation, but bad investments and the failing market conditions made it difficult to recover.\n\nPettersson did however find a gold deposit on Simberi Island which he kept secret for years. Even today, the Tabar Group of islands has one of the world's largest gold deposits. His fortunes changed, however, and Pettersson decided to leave the island. His wife Jessie traveled ahead to Australia for medical treatment and then returned to Sweden. She died in Stockholm from malaria and cancer on 19 May 1935. Petterson's health also deteriorated.\n\nPettersson left Tabar in 1935 but never returned to Sweden. He died of a heart attack in Sydney on 12 May 1937.\n\nCarl Pettersson is regarded as the inspiration for Ephraim Longstocking, Pippi's father in Astrid Lindgren's children's series, Pippi Longstocking.\nIn 2012, film writer Jorn Rossing Jensen reported that Swedish producer Mirijam Johansson, of Sweden's Wanted Pictures, announced at Cannes that she had acquired the rights to \"Efraim Longstocking and the Cannibal Princess\", a film based on a screenplay by Daniel Fridell and Ulf Stark and approved by Saltkråkan, the latter of which holds Lindgren's rights.\n\n"}
{"id": "505728", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=505728", "title": "Claude Jutra", "text": "Claude Jutra\n\nClaude Jutra (; March 11, 1930 – November 5, 1986) was a French Canadian actor, film director and writer.\n\nThe Prix Jutra, and the Academy of Canadian Cinema and Television's Claude Jutra Award, were named in his honor because of his importance in Quebec cinema history. The awards were renamed in 2016 following the publication of allegations that he had sexually abused children during his lifetime, as were streets named for him.\n\nJutra was born and raised in Montreal, Quebec as Claude Jutras. His father, Albert Jutras, was a radiologist and a director of the Collège des médecins du Québec. He made the short films \"Dément du lac Jean-Jeunes\" and \"Perpetual Movement (Mouvement perpétuel)\" before graduating from the Université de Montréal with a degree in medicine, but turned to filmmaking instead of medical practice after completing his degree. He studied theatre in Montréal (1952–53) and wrote his first original Quebec television play (\"L'Ecole de la peur\") in 1953, and a television series, \"Images en boite\", in 1954.\n\nHe went to work at the National Film Board of Canada in 1956 where he trained in all facets of filmmaking, although his first film for the NFB, \"Trio-Brio\", was permanently lost when the organization moved its head office from Ottawa to Montreal. As a filmmaker, he dropped the s from his surname, a common Québécois surname, because the Jutra spelling was more distinctive. In 1958 he went to France and Africa to work with noted French filmmaker, Jean Rouch.\n\nClaude Jutra's career in film, in a certain sense, paralleled Quebec cinema itself. Beginning as an amateur at a time when there was no Quebec cinema, he participated in (and sometime led) several of the principal developments in Quebec: traditional documentaries and docudramas at the NFB; the germinal period of direct cinema; the first steps in the early 1960s toward independent film production; and later trend toward large-budget features, such as \"Kamouraska\", a box office failure now revealed to be a major work in the canon of Canadian cinema. Overall, his work had a consistent thematic pattern: young people and the (often traumatic) passage from innocence to knowledge, a theme that has nostalgic overtones.\n\nWith financing and production provided by the NFB, Jutra co-wrote and directed the 1971 film \"Mon oncle Antoine\", which until very recently has consistently been ranked as the best Canadian movie ever made. As well as directing several cinema vérité shorts such as \"Wrestling\" and \"The Devil's Toy\", he also co-directed with Norman McLaren and starred in the innovative pixilation Academy Award-nominated short, \"A Chairy Tale\".\n\nHe was offered the Order of Canada in 1972 but declined because he was a Quebec separatist. In 1984, he was awarded the Prix Albert-Tessier, given to individuals for an outstanding career in Québec cinema.\n\nJutra was diagnosed with early-onset Alzheimer's disease in the early 1980s. He was reported missing on November 5, 1986. His body was found in the St. Lawrence River in April 1987, with a note in his pocket reading \"Je m'appelle Claude Jutra\" (\"My name is Claude Jutra\"); an autopsy later confirmed drowning as his cause of death.\n\nIn 2016, thirty years after Jutra's death, journalist Yves Lever wrote in the book \"Claude Jutra, biographie\" and claimed that Jutra was a pederast. Lever said that \"one of Jutra's victims was under 14 years old.\" He also maintained that Jutra's proclivities were known by many people in the industry, \"but nobody made a big deal out of it.\" Lever's allegations were not officially proven, as no victims publicly came forward; however, in the wake of the allegations, Québec Cinéma held an emergency meeting to discuss changing the name of the Prix Jutra.\n\nOn February 17, 2016 \"La Presse\" published an interview with an alleged victim of Jutra, who requested to remain anonymous, relating sexual contact ranging from embrace to oral sex from the time the victim was 6 to 16. On the same day and based on the information in the same article, the Minister of Culture of Quebec, Hélène David, asked Cinéma Québec to remove the name Jutra from its prizes recognizing cinematic achievements in Quebec, which they did. She also mandated the Commission de toponymie (Quebec Toponymy Commission), a sub-agency of Office québécois de la langue française which reports to the Minister of Culture, to assemble a list of all streets and public places in the province bearing the name Jutra. On the same day, Montreal mayor Denis Coderre announced that the city would remove Jutra's name from streets and parks in its jurisdiction.\n\nOf the controversy, \"The Globe and Mail\" said: \"Few legendary figures have fallen so quickly and so completely. Merely 24 hours after the official publication of the first explosive allegation of child abuse against the Canadian cinematic pioneer, the film industry and governments started scrubbing the name Claude Jutra from every trophy, park and street.\"\n\n\nJutra made his debut as a director with \"Le dément du lac Jean-Jeunes\" - it explored themes that remained throughout his work, a nostalgia for childhood, madness, and troubled waters.\n\nHis collaboration with Michel Brault began at this early period. \"Mouvement perpétuel\" was influenced by Jean Cocteau's \"Le Sang d'un poète\". \"L'École de la peur\" (1953) was the first television film made in Quebec. Towards the end of the 1950s he moved to France and François Truffaut, who became a friend, asked him to direct a Cocteau scenario, \"Anna la Bonne\" (1959). In 1960 Jutra returned to Canada.\n\n\n\nCanadian Film Awards\n\n\nGenie Awards\n\n\nMoscow International Film Festival\n\n\nJutra's close friend, filmmaker Paule Baillargeon, directed the feature documentary \"Claude Jutra: An Unfinished Story\" in 2002.\n\nMarie-Josée Saint-Pierre used a mix of archival footage of Jutra with animation to create the 2014 short documentary film \"Jutra\".\n\nBesides the film awards (Claude Jutra Award and Jutra Award), a number of places bear or bore Jutra's name, all found in Quebec:\n\n\nMultiple parks and streets were later renamed or scheduled to be renamed after the pederasty controversy in 2016.\n\nBooks and thesis\n\nArticles\n\n"}

Wightman (early 1792 – October 26 1841) was one of the Old Three Hundred Texas colonists, having moved there in 1824. He was often employed as a surveyor for Stephen F. Austin's colony.\n\nWightman was born early in 1792 in Herkimer County, New York to parents Benjamin and Esther (nee Randall) Wightman. His father was a Baptist preacher and father to 11 children. Elias taught school in New York and then traveled to Texas in 1824. Stephen F. Austin named him in July 1825 to appraise cargo damaged aboard the schooner \"Lady of the Lake\". In August 1826, Wightman joined others to petition Austin to charter a town at Matagorda. Wightman also petitioned Austin for a league of land and on May 25, 1827 he accepted title to a sitio (or league) in Matagorda County. The sitio was located at the mouth of the Colorado River on the east bank of the river.\n\nIn 1828, Austin sent Wightman and David G. Burnet to the United States to recruit new settlers. While in New York, Wightman married Mary Sherwood, a former student, on October 26, 1828. The couple began their return journey on November 2, 1828 with 50–60 colonists, mostly New Yorkers. They went by wagon to the Allegheny River where they transferred to boat for the trip down the Ohio and Mississippi Rivers. From New Orleans they sailed west on the schooner \"Little Zoe\", beginning on December 26. Bad weather and the tricky passage of the river channel kept them from landing in Matagorda until January 27, 1829. They lived in the small fort for several months until they could get lumber to build a simple cabin. Mary taught school and Sunday school in a log school house from 1829 to 1832. His parents, who made the trip from New York, both died in 1830 and are the earliest burials in the Matagorda Cemetery.\n\nWightman probably attended an 1829 meeting with Austin at San Felipe to discuss founding a masonic lodge. He was elected surveyor for Matagorda in August 1829. That October, he surveyed the town of Marion. In 1830, he frequently corresponded with frequently Austin while working for him as a surveyor. He promised to teach school for one year and discussed starting a salt works. He and his wife obtained land along Caney Creek which they farmed with several slaves. During the Runaway Scrape in 1836, Mary, her sister, an orphan girl, the family's slaves, and several neighbors fled the Mexican army by sea and were stranded at Galveston. They only returned to Caney Creek with difficulty. \n\nIn 1837 Wightman was elected Justice of the Peace in Matagorda County. The next year he joined a company exploring the possibility of clearing Caney Creek for navigation. In 1840 he wrote a letter to Mirabeau B. Lamar suggesting that John Delap succeed Silas Dinsmore as county judge. In 1841, Wightman sold his Texas lands and moved to Covington, Kentucky, looking for a more healthy climate. He died there on October 26, 1841. In the 1980s some of Wightman's surveyor notes were placed in the Matagorda County Museum in Bay City, Texas. His compass, which he shared with William Selkirk, can be seen there as well.\n\n"}

She met and married the actor-producer Seymour Hicks in 1893, and the two collaborated on many projects for the stage and screen.\n\nThe daughter of the actor William Terriss, Ellaline made her London stage debut at the age of 16 in \"Cupid's Messenger\" at London's Haymarket Theatre. Impressed with her performance, the producer Charles Wyndham gave her a three-year contract, under which she first played Madge in \"Why Women Weep\". In 1892 Terriss starred in \"Faithful James\" (by B. C. Stephenson) and the following year she starred in the title role of \"Cinderella\", produced by Henry Irving. She was featured in W. S. Gilbert's \"His Excellency\" in 1894, followed the next year by a starring role in the George Edwardes production of the musical \"The Shop Girl\", playing alongside her husband. The next year she starred in another musical hit, \"The Circus Girl\".\n\nIn 1897, her father was murdered by a deranged actor. As a result, she received much public sympathy, returning to the stage to star in \"A Runaway Girl\" in 1898, one of her most successful shows. In the 1900s, she starred in a series of long-running hits, including \"Bluebell in Fairyland\" (1901), \"Quality Street\" (1902), \"The Catch of the Season\" (1905) and \"The Beauty of Bath\" (1906). After 1910, Terriss concentrated on comedy roles and music hall tours. Her unsuccessful return to musical comedy, \"Cash on Delivery\" (1917), confirmed the wisdom of this new career course.\n\nHer later career also included film roles. She began in the silent films \"Scrooge\" and \"David Garrick\" (both from 1913) and made a successful transfer to talkies; her last film was \"The Four Just Men\" in 1939. She died in Hampstead, England, at the age of 100.\n\nTerriss was born Mary Ellaline Lewin in Port Stanley, Falkland Islands.\n\nHer father, William Lewin, became a well-known actor in London under the name William Terriss. He loved the adventurous, outdoor life, and had previously tried his hand at various professions, including farmer, merchant seaman and silver miner. Shortly after Ellaline's birth, he gave up farming and moved his family back to England where, because of his swashbuckling style, was known as \"Breezy Bill\". Her brother Tom became an actor and then a well-known film director. Her mother Isabel (née Lewis) also acted under the stage name Amy Fellowes.\n\nTerriss performed from an early age, although she had no real ambition to act professionally. In 1887, she appeared in pantomime at the Alexandra Theatre, Liverpool. Petite, pretty and talented, she attracted the praise of both critics and the public. She came to the attention of Herbert Beerbohm Tree, who signed her to make her professional London debut in the role of Mary Herbert in \"Cupid's Messenger\", in 1888 at the Haymarket Theatre. Impressed by this performance, Charles Wyndham gave her a three-year contract, under which she first played Madge in \"Why Women Weep\". She also attracted the attention of a promising young actor, Seymour Hicks, and they married in 1893.\n\nIn 1892, Terriss starred in \"Faithful James\", by B.C. Stephenson, with Brandon Thomas at the Court Theatre. In December 1893, Terriss starred in the title role in the successful and famously lavish version of the \"fairy pantomime\" \"Cinderella\", produced by Henry Irving with music by Oscar Barrett. Toward the end of the run, Hicks took over the role of Thisbe, one of Cinderella's half-sisters. They brought this production to America under the management of George Edwardes. The following season, Terriss played a supporting role in the W.S. Gilbert and Frank Osmond Carr comic opera \"His Excellency\".\n\nIn 1895, Terriss was a replacement in the original London production of George Edwardes's hit, \"The Shop Girl\", joining her husband as co-star. They toured America in 1895, where they befriended the American novelist Richard Harding Davis. At the instance of Gilbert, Hicks wrote a drama called \"One of the Best\", a vehicle for Terriss's father William Terriss at the Adelphi Theatre, based on the famous Dreyfus trial. The Hickses were frequent guests of Gilbert at his estate in Grim's Dyke. Terriss next played the title role, May, in \"My Girl\" (1896 at the Gaiety). Another early success for the young couple was \"The Circus Girl\" (1896; Terriss made Lionel Monckton's song, \"A Little Bit of String\" into a major hit).\n\nIn December 1897, while Terriss was still playing in \"The Circus Girl\", two tragedies befell her. Her father was stabbed to death by a deranged and disgruntled unemployed actor, Richard Archer Prince, as he was about to enter the stage door of the Royal Adelphi Theatre. Her mother died shortly afterwards.\n\nThe murder, and Prince's trial, filled the country's newspapers for weeks. Already the most popular couple on the London stage, Terriss and Hicks received an outpouring of sympathy. They moved on, becoming even more famous over the next decade. She next starred in the title role of a new show co-authored by Hicks, \"A Runaway Girl\" (1898), which became one of the Gaiety Theatre's most successful shows. This was followed by \"With Flying Colours\" (1899). The couple adopted a daughter, Mabel, in 1889, and Terriss gave birth to another child, Betty, in 1904.\n\nIn early 1900, the Hickses played in their only Broadway show together, \"My Daughter-in-law\", at the Frohman brothers' old Lyceum Theatre. They then joined forces with the producer Charles Frohman and, in his company over a period of seven years, they played the leads in a series of musicals written by Hicks, including: \"Bluebell in Fairyland\" (1901), which was continually revived as a Christmas entertainment for the next four decades; \"The Cherry Girl\" (1902); \"The Beauty of Bath\" (1906), which opened the Hicks Theatre (later renamed the Globe) and included additional lyrics by a newcomer, P.G. Wodehouse, and music by Jerome Kern, which became one of Terriss's best-loved roles; and \"The Gay Gordons\" (1907).\n\nHicks and Terriss also starred in J.M. Barrie's play \"Quality Street\" in 1902. At that time, they moved to a new home, the Old Forge, at Merstham, Surrey. Their cul-de-sac was renamed \"Quality Street\".\n\nThe couple performed constantly, both in London and on tour in America, except when Terriss was pregnant with Betty. In 1905, Terriss took over the role of Angela in her husband's \"The Catch of the Season\", which had been created by Zena Dare during Terriss's pregnancy. Later Terriss ceded the role to Dare's sister, Phyllis.\n\nIn 1907, Terriss reduced the grueling acting schedule she had kept up for almost twenty years. She did continue to appear in a limited number of plays, including \"The Dashing Little Duke\" (1909; with C. Hayden Coffin, Courtice Pounds and Louie Pounds), which was less successful. She played the title role in that production (a woman playing a man). When she missed several performances due to illness, Hicks played the role – possibly the only case in the history of the musical where a husband succeeded to his wife's role.\n\nAfter the failure of \"Captain Kidd\" (1910), Hicks and Terriss concentrated on comedy roles and music hall tours, including a tour of South Africa in 1911 and later a tour of France following the outbreak of World War I, to give concerts to British troops at the front. Their unsuccessful return to musical comedy, \"Cash on Delivery\" (1917), confirmed the wisdom of their new career course. After 1917, Terriss returned to the stage only on special occasions. In December 1925, she appeared at the Lyceum with her husband in \"The Man in Dress Clothes\", a French farce he had translated and in which their daughter made her stage debut. It was intended only to run for a short season, but it was such a success that its run was extended. \"The Theatre World\" reported in January 1926:\n\nTerriss appeared in over a dozen British films, generally in which her husband was involved as an actor, writer or director. These included the silent films \"Scrooge\" (1913), \"David Garrick\" (1913), \"Flame of Passion\" (1915), \"A Woman of the World\" (1916), \"Masks and Faces\" (1918), \"Always Tell Your Wife\" (1923), \"Land of Hope and Glory\" (1927) and \"Blighty\" (1927).\n\nShe made a successful transition to talkies, including \"Atlantic\" (1929), \"A Man of Mayfair\" (1931), \"Glamour\" (1931), \"The Iron Duke\" (1934), \"Royal Cavalcade\" (1935) and \"The Four Just Men\" (1939).\n\nIn 1940, Terriss and Hicks went to the Middle East with \"ENSA\", to entertain the British toops in World War II. After the war, Terriss retired from the stage. She and Hicks moved to South Africa, where she took up painting and was tutored by the marine artist George Pilkington. So good were her works that an exhibition was held at Foyle's Art Gallery, London, in February 1959. Hicks, who was knighted in 1935, died in 1949, and Terriss survived him by 22 years.\n\nShe was the subject of an episode of \"This Is Your Life\" in 1962 when host Eamonn Andrews surprised her while she was sketching in the garden of her home in Richmond, Surrey.\n\nTerriss died at the Holy Family Nursing Home, Hampstead, London, at the age of 100 as a result of a hip fracture sustained during a fall.\n\n\n"}

His father's mother was also a Russian. Because his grandmother was a Russian, she and the children were not deported as part of Aardakh but the father, a Chechen, was, thus separating his father's nuclear family, until they were reunited when the Chechens were allowed to return from their exile in Central Asia. During his childhood, the Sadulaev family had views that were at times considered pro-Russian by other Chechens. Sadulaev himself speaks both fluent Chechen and fluent Russian, and identifies as an ethnic Chechen; according to traditional Chechen culture one is considered a member of the ethnic group as well as the specific teip by patrilineal descent. He was born into the teip of Ersenoy.\n\nIn 1989, aged sixteen, he left Chechnya to study law at Leningrad State University. Today he lives and works as a lawyer in St Petersburg.\n\nGerman Sadulaev's first book, \"Radio FUCK\", told city tales of the thirty-something generation in St Petersburg. It made no mention of Chechnya. With the publication of his second book, \"I am a Chechen!\", critics acclaimed Sadulaev as \"the literary find of the year\" . Much more than a war novel, it was a lyrical fusion of exotic legends, stories and memories, nominated for the National Bestseller prize. Sadulaev's next work, \"Snowstorm, or The Myth of the End of the World\", was a grotesque fantasy satire about social Darwinism. It won the Eureka prize. Sadulaev's fourth book, \"The Maya Pill\", was shortlisted for the 2008 Russian Booker and for the 2009 National Bestseller .\n\nGerman Sadulaev's \"I am a Chechen!\" (translated by Anna Gunin) was published by Harvill Secker in 2010. \"The Maya Pill\" (translated by Carol Apollonio) will be published by Dalkey Archive Press in 2013.\n\nIn 2016, he ran for Duma as a representative of the Communist Party of the Russian Federation.\n\n\n"}

Jointly with Herbert A. Hauptman, he was awarded the Nobel Prize in Chemistry in 1985, for the direct analysis of crystal structures using X-ray scattering techniques.\n\nKarle was born in New York City, on June 18, 1918, the son of Sadie Helen (Kun) and Louis Karfunkle. He was born into a Jewish family with a strong interest in the arts. He had played piano as a youth and had participated in a number of competitions, but he was far more interested in science. He attended Abraham Lincoln High School in Brooklyn, and would later join Arthur Kornberg (awarded the Nobel in Medicine in 1959) and Paul Berg (a winner in Chemistry in 1980), as graduates of the school to win Nobel Prizes. As a youth, Karle enjoyed handball, ice skating, touch football and swimming in the nearby Atlantic Ocean.\n\nHe started college at the age of 15 and received his bachelor's degree from the City College of New York in 1937, where he took additional courses in biology, chemistry and math in addition to the required curriculum there. He earned a master's degree from Harvard University in 1938, having majored in biology.\n\nAs part of a plan to accumulate enough money to pay for further graduate studies, Karle took a position in Albany, New York with the New York State Department of Health, where he developed a method to measure dissolved fluoride levels, a technique that would become a standard for water fluoridation.\n\nHe enrolled at the University of Michigan in 1940 and met his future wife, Isabella Lugoski, who was sitting at an adjoining desk during his first course in physical chemistry. The two married in 1942. They were both supervised in their Ph.D. studies by physical chemist Lawrence Brockway. Though Karle completed his studies in 1943, he was awarded his Ph.D. the following year.\n\nJerome Karle was a former president of both the American Crystallographic Association (ACA) (1972) and the IUCr (1981-1984), as well as a co-recipient of the 1985 Nobel Prize in Chemistry for his work on direct methods. Among the many additional honors he received for his work, he was elected to the National Academy of Sciences in 1976 and the American Philosophical Society in 1990.\n\nStarting in 1943, after completing graduate studies, Karle worked on the Manhattan Project at the University of Chicago with his wife Dr. Isabella Karle, one of the youngest scientists and few women on the project. In 1944, they returned to the University of Michigan, where Karle worked on a project for the United States Naval Research Laboratory. In 1946, they moved to Washington, D.C. to work for the Naval Research Laboratory.\n\nKarle and Herbert A. Hauptman were awarded the Nobel Prize in Chemistry in 1985 for their work in using X-ray scattering techniques to determine the structure of crystals, a technique that is used to study the biological, chemical, metallurgical and physical characteristics. They were able to employ the Sayre equation in centrosymmetric structure, developing the so-called direct methods. Through isolating the position of the atoms in a crystal, the molecular structure of the material being studied can be determined, allowing processes to be designed to duplicate the molecules being studied. This technique has played a major role in the development of new pharmaceutical products and other synthesized materials.\nKarle and his wife retired from the U.S. Naval Research Laboratory on July 31, 2009, after a combined 127 years of service to the United States Government, with Karle joining the NRL in 1944 and his wife two years later. At the time of his departure from government service, Karle held the Chair of Science as Chief Scientist of the Laboratory for the Structure of Matter. Retirement ceremonies for the Karles were attended by United States Secretary of the Navy Ray Mabus, who presented the couple with the Department of the Navy Distinguished Civilian Service Award, the Navy's highest form of recognition to civilian employees.\n\nKarle was married to Isabella Karle with whom he had three daughters, all of whom work in scientific fields:\n\nKarle died of liver cancer at the Leewood Healthcare Center in Annandale, Virginia.\n\n\n"}

After his death his devotees conflated his identity with two other monks named João Maria who wandered, preached and cured in the region. \nThere are many places where a small cross or altar marks a place where the monk \"João Maria\" stopped.\nThere are many who think that João Maria is still working his miracles today.\n\nJoão Maria de Jesus was originally named Anastás Marcaf. He was probably a Syrian of Greek ancestry.\nHe arrived in Brazil from Argentina in 1886.\nWhen asked where he came from he said he was born in the sea and raised in Buenos Aires.\nOne legend about João Maria de Jesus is that he abandoned the Christian religion to marry a pagan, and fought the French expeditionary army. \nAfter his wife's death he was made a prisoner, managed to escape, and had a vision of the apostle Paul who sent him on a pilgrimage for 14 (or perhaps 40) years as penance. \nOther legends held that he had committed some crime, or had seduced a nun, and as penance had to wander alone in the back country.\n\nIn the 1890s João Maria de Jesus began to wander in southern Brazil.\nHe said he had a dream that he would walk the world for fourteen years without eating meat on Wednesdays, Fridays or Saturdays, and without staying in anyone's house.\nJoão Maria de Jesus's appearance, with a long white beard, and way of life were similar to João Maria D’Agostini, who had preached and healed in the region earlier.\nHe followed a similar path to D’Agostini, and blessed several sources of water.\nHe assumed the first monk's names and sanctity as a means to gain credibility among the people, but never claimed that he was a reincarnation of the first João Maria.\n\nDuring the Federalist Revolution of 1893–95 João Maria de Jesus attended wounded rebels.\nHis teachings were prophetic and apocalyptic.\nHe said God would punish mankind with plagues of insects and bloody wars.\nHe thought the First Brazilian Republic of 1889 was the work of the devil, and defended restoration of the monarchy as the \"order of God\".\nThe doctor and federalist colonel Angelo Dourado met João Maria, who claimed to have foreseen the present war, and said the republicans were animated by the devil, and had strength and money, but the others would win even without arms.\nJoão Maria de Jesus became famous as a healer, and his medicine was thought to be miraculous.\nIt was said he could cure a person simply by praying for their health and prescribing a tea from a common herb called \"monk's broom\".\nHe was quoted as saying, \"He who does not know how to read the book of nature is illiterate in God's eyes.\"\nHis devotees thought that all objects or places that he touched became sacred, and would provide the hermit's blessings after he had disappeared.\nJoão Maria de Jesus avoided gatherings of followers, and did not spend long in one place, so was less of a hermit than the first João Maria. \nHe performed sacraments such as baptism despite being a layman, which caused conflicts with the clergy.\n\nJoão Maria de Jesus disappeared in 1908.\nHe may have died in 1908 in hospital in Ponta Grossa, Paraná, or may be buried in Lagoa Vermelha, Rio Grande do Sul.\nHis devotees think the monk is still living in the Morro Taió, a hill in Santa Catarina.\n\nOne legend tells that when João Maria de Jesus was passing through Ponta Grossa early in the 1900s some children playing in the street threw stones at him.\nThe monk calmly called for retribution, saying, \"Rude city, the stones that hurt me now will multiply and come back to you one day.\"\nAccording to the legend on 11 September 1906 an intense rain of stones fell in the town, damaging or destroying several houses.\nThis is just one of several legends in which a cruel streak appears when the monk was offended in some way.\n\nA common legend is that in the middle of storms the monk sat outside but did not get wet.\nOthers said he could be praying in his cave and at the same time be next to a sick man, helping him. \nHe was said to be able to become invisible to his persecutors, walk over the water of rivers, drive out evil spirits and calm storms, among other miracles.\nHe was said to be immune to Indians and wild animals, who never attacked him.\nThere are many stories of healing.\nThe legends have become part of the folklore of the region.\n\nJoão Maria de Jesus and João Maria D’Agostini were the two best-known of the monks named \"João Maria\" who wandered in the region preaching in the last part of the 19th century.\nThere is a large literature about the monks called João Maria, but the devout population have little interest in their historicity and are much more concerned with the sacred characteristics attributed to them.\nThere are people today who think that João Maria, now more than 200 years old, still wanders in the region and works his miracles.\nThere are many places in the center and east of Paraná and Santa Catarina, the south of São Paulo and the north of Rio Grande do Sul, where a small altar or cross marks a place where one of the \"João Marias\" would have passed.\n\nThe various wanderers recognized as the monk or prophet João Maria all have strong similarities.\nThey are pilgrims, without home or family. They have withdrawn from the pleasures of the world to do penance by serving God.\nThey preach the Apocalypse, when God will punish all sinners.\nThey have the miraculous power of healing, and they are immortal.\n\nJoão Maria de Jesus was photographed by Herculano Fonseca of Ponta Grossa in 1898, and these photographs were copied by a photographer from Caxias do Sul, Giácomo Geremia, who sold many copies of them.\nIn the 1970s and 1980s the images were widely distributed among the local Kaingang and Xokleng people by leaders of the Indian Missionary Council.\nThese photographs continue to be widely reproduced in southern Brazil today.\nSome have the legend \"Prophéta Jõao Maria de Jesúz, 180 anos\".\nOthers calls him \"Santo\" (saint) with the legend \"João Maria de Jesus com 188 anos\", which would give a birth date around the time when the first João Maria was born.\nA painting that copies one of the photographs has the legend \"Jõao Maria de Agostinho Propheta\", reflecting the confusion with the earlier João Maria.\n\nThe monk stayed near a spring of water in the Uvaranas neighborhood of Ponta Grossa. \nThe place was still being visited by devotees in 2012.\nA woman who cares for the site at that time said she had witnessed three apparitions of João Maria de Jesus.\n\n\n"}

He became a servant of Prince Henry the Navigator of Portugal (the son of king John I), who initiated the so-called Portuguese Age of Discovery in the 15th century.\n\nAs a native of a city belonging to the Hanseatic league, Jácome de Bruges had been exposed to well-ordered mercantilism, and he understood the value of international trade as a driver of national prosperity. Consequently, he was a logical candidate to enter into the service of the like-minded Prince Henry in Portugal.\n\nJácome, arrived on the Iberian peninsula, with many of his compatriots on business, and lived in the northern city of Porto for at least ten years. The perceived notion that de Bruges was recommended by Joos van Moerkerke (a Flemish nobleman in the service of Isabella of Burgundy, sister of Duarte I of Portugal) was dismissed, with the Silves document between de Burges and Henry. It was seigniorial contract between the two men; in the 2 March 1450 contract, de Bruges received the first license from Prince Henry to lead a contingent of settlers to the island of Terceira, the 'third' island of the Azorean archipelago. The document did not stipulate the nationality, and along with seventeen Flemish families, de Bruges settled on Terceira. Yet, even with his efforts, and ten years, Jácome de Bruges was unable to fulfill his contract, which was confirmed by the donation letter of the islands of Terceira and Graciosa, made by Prince Henry to his nephew, the Infante D. Fernando. The Infante Fernando then changed the colonial settlement strategy, sending people of confidence to the islands (ultimately the contract between Bruges and Henry expired and he returned to the continent).\n\nBut, by the end of the 16th century, de Bruges returned to Terceira; he was one of two captains who were sent to the island: Jácome de Bruges installed his administration in the region of Praia, while Álvaro Martins Homem settled in Angra. Both captains commanded two distinct groups of colonists, all Portuguese and no Flemish.\n\nJácome de Bruges disappeared mysteriously, with the suggestion that he was murdered, thrown overboard while at sea, during a voyage. \nJácome de Bruges descendent, his daughter, eventually married Duarte Paim, founding the Paim de Bruges noble family.\n\nUltimately more than two thousand Flemish settled in the Azores during the fifteenth century. Although these Flemish immigrants quickly adapted to Portuguese manners, habits, and culture, their legacy — in the form of windmills, clothing, and some lingering physical traits (blond hair and blue eyes) — have persisted until the present day on some Azorean islands to remind visitors of a Flemish heritage. Because of the presence of Flemish farmers, the Azores were known, until quite recently, as the \"Islas de Flamengos\" (Flemish Isles).\n\n\n\n"}

He is best known as one of the two founders and chairman of Cobra Beer.\n\nKaran Bilimoria was born in Hyderabad, India into a Zoroastrian Parsi family that has a background in the armed forces and business. His father, Lt. General Faridoon Noshire Bilimoria PVSM (1933–2005), popularly known as 'General Billy', was the General Officer Commanding-in-Chief of the Central Army Command of the Indian Army, who had also served as ADC to the first Indian President, Rajendra Prasad, and commanded the 2/5 Gorkha Rifles (Frontier Force) during the Bangladesh Liberation War.\n\nLt. General Bilimoria, while General Officer Commanding-in-Chief of the Central Indian Army, was also sent by the Government of India to Sri Lanka in 1990 to review the work of the Indian Peace Keeping Force which had been deployed in that country during the Sri Lankan Civil War under the Indo-Sri Lanka Accord, and it was on his recommendations that the force was recalled in 1990, ending India's military engagement with the LTTE.\n\nKaran's paternal grandfather, Nasservanji D. Bilimoria, was one of the first Indians to be commissioned as an officer at the Royal Military Academy Sandhurst into the British Indian Army and retired as a Brigadier. His mother, Yasmin Bilimoria \"nee\" Italia, was the daughter of Jamshed D. Italia, a Squadron Leader in the Royal Indian Air Force, and Aimai Italia \"nee\" Bharucha of Hyderabad. His maternal great-grandfather, D.D. Italia, was a Hyderabad-based businessman and politician who served as a member of the Rajya Sabha in the 1950s. Both his mother and maternal grandfather were educated in Britain at Birmingham University.\n\nAs the name denotes, Bilimora is the ancestral name of a city situated on the banks of the river Ambika, in Gandevi taluka and Navsari district of Gujarat state in India, where the family comes from originally.\n\nKaran did his early schooling in Hyderabad from Hyderabad Public School at Begumpet, Hyderabad where the family lived at his mother's ancestral home, Anand Bhavan, while his father served in different military stations in the country. As he grew, his family began to accompany his father, and Karan attended seven different schools before he was sent to board at the Hebron School, Ooty in the Nilgiris, Tamil Nadu, alongside his younger brother, Nadir. When he was still nineteen, Karan received his Bachelor of Commerce degree from Osmania University in Hyderabad in 1981.\n\nOn receiving a scholarship, he then moved to London where he qualified as a chartered accountant with what is today Ernst & Young and received a diploma in accounting from the London Metropolitan University. Thereafter he read law at Sidney Sussex College, Cambridge. While at Cambridge, Karan played on the university's polo team, organising their first ever tour of India, receiving a Half-Blue in 1988, and led the debating team against Oxford for two years, becoming also the Vice-President of the Cambridge Union before graduating in 1988.\n\nIn 1993 he married Lynne Heather Walker, a South African national, whom he met through mutual friends. She is an English and Latin graduate of Rhodes University.\n\nDuring the India tour of the Cambridge polo team, Karan noticed that the polo sticks made in India were different and of better quality than those made in Britain. At the time, polo sticks made in Argentina were very popular but following the Falklands War, imports of Argentinian products into Britain had been banned and there was little competition to British manufacturers. Karan began to import polo sticks from India to fill in the gap, selling these successfully and profitably to Harrod's and Lillywhites. He also experimented with importing fashion goods, fabrics, and other products from India, but unlike the polo sticks these were not very successful ventures.\n\nIn 1989, along with his friend Arjun Reddy, Karan founded Cobra Beer in a little flat in Fulham. The idea for the beer had come up while he was a student at Cambridge, where he regularly ate his meals at Indian restaurants. He noticed that regular lager was too gassy and bloating to be enjoyed with food, while ale was too bitter to accompany a meal. He came up with a concept for a beer that had 'the refreshing qualities of a lager' but the 'smoothness and drinkability of an ale' to accompany food – in particular, Indian food and curry. In 1989, after concluding his import-export ventures, Karan and Arjun Reddy started Cobra Beer.\n\nAt the time Karan had a student debt of £20,000, and funds to start the business were not easy to find. Borrowing money from various sources and £30,000 from a bank, Cobra commenced operations. A brewer in Bangalore, India, Dr Subroto Cariapa, and the owner of Mysore Breweries, Mr Balan, liked the idea of the beer and helped create Cobra. From India, then, it was imported to Britain. In a battered old Citroen 2CV, Karan himself began distributing 15 cases of beer at a time across London and, slowly, outside it.\n\nSince marketing on a large scale was not an option because of the paucity of funds, penetrating Britain's highly competitive beer market required an innovative approach. The task was made all the more challenging because by 1990 the country was also in an economic recession. Cobra took off in these circumstances by creating a niche for itself in the market. Indian curry was becoming increasingly popular in the country at the time and so Cobra Beer was marketed and sold as the perfect drink to go with it. Karan himself delivered cases of Cobra to Indian restaurants, where it became very popular with customers. Within five years, the one million mark in sales revenues was crossed. Cobra began to be served across the United Kingdom in thousands of Indian restaurants and the business began to grow, expanding into the pub and bar sector and also being sold in major supermarket chains. In 1999, the company diversified into wine.\n\nBy 2001 Cobra, from which Karan's partner had now exited, had a turnover of nearly £13 million with a sales growth rate of nearly 60% per year, and was being brewed locally in the UK by Charles Wells Ltd. By 2007 Cobra was being sold in over 45 countries, and had a total production capacity of 450,000 cases per month. Revenues stood at £30 million and, with rapid expansion, were expected to cross £100 million by 2010.\n\nOn 29 May 2009 the company went into administration. The company owed an estimated £70 million to creditors. Molson Coors, one of the world's largest brewers, then paid circa £14 million for a 50.1% share in a pre-pack administration deal, leaving Bilimoria and his shareholders with the other 49.9%, and signed a joint venture deal under the name the Cobra Beer Partnership, of which Bilimoria is chairman.\n\nOn 7 October 2009 Bilimoria claimed that the creditors of Cobra Beer will be settled out of future profits of the joint venture.\n\nIn 2005 Lord Bilimoria helped to establish the Cobra Foundation, an independent charity that provides health, education and community support for young people in South Asia. The charity focuses on the provision of safe water and also provides support to disaster relief efforts in the region.\n\nSince 2014, the Cobra Foundation has partnered with Belu water to launch a new range of bottled water, with 100% of the profits made donated to WaterAid. This partnership enabled the Cobra Foundation to donate £17,000 to WaterAid's efforts in South Asia in 2015.\n\nOn 17 July 2014, Lord Bilimoria was installed as the 7th Chancellor of the University of Birmingham. The previous holders of the office were Joseph Chamberlain, Robert Cecil, 1st Viscount Cecil of Chelwood, Anthony Eden, Sir Peter Scott, Sir Alex Jarratt and Sir Dominic Cadbury.\n\nLord Bilimoria was appointed as a Deputy Lieutenant for Greater London in 2001 and he was appointed a Commander of the Order of the British Empire (CBE) in the 2004 Birthday Honours for his services to business and entrepreneurship. He was appointed an Independent Crossbench Life Peer in the House of Lords and was created Baron Bilimoria, \"of Chelsea in the Royal Borough of Kensington and Chelsea\" on 16 June 2006. He is the first Zoroastrian Parsi to sit in the House of Lords. \nLord Bilimoria has been a non-executive director and Senior Independent Director of the Booker Group PLC, the UK's largest wholesale operator, since 2007. In 2011 he became Chairman of Molson Coors Cobra India, a joint venture between Cobra Beer and Molson Coors in India. He was awarded an Honorary Doctorate from Heriot-Watt University in 2005. He served as the Bynum Tudor Fellow of Kellogg College, Oxford for the 2017-18 academic year.\n\n\n\n"}

Her work in film and television has resulted in a Golden Globe award, with two additional nominations, and four Emmy nominations. Deaf since she was 18 months old, due to illness and high fevers, she is also a prominent member of the National Association of the Deaf. Her longtime interpreter is Jack Jason.\n\nMatlin was born in Morton Grove, Illinois, to Libby (née Hammer) and Donald Matlin (1930–2013), who was an automobile dealer.\n\nShe lost all hearing in her right ear and 80% of the hearing in her left ear at the age of 18 months.

She and her two older brothers, Eric and Marc, grew up in a Reform Jewish household. Her family roots are in Poland and Russia. Matlin attended a synagogue for the Deaf (Congregation Bene Shalom), and after studying Hebrew phonetically, was able to learn her Torah portion for her Bat Mitzvah.

She also addresses the sexual abuse she suffered as a child at the hands of her female babysitter.\n\nShe enjoys a sense of humor about her deafness: \"Often I’m talking to people through my speaker phone, and after 10 minutes or so they say, 'Wait a minute, Marlee, how can you hear me?' They forget I have an interpreter there who is signing to me as they talk. So I say, 'You know what? I can hear on Wednesdays.'\"\n\nMatlin married Burbank police officer Kevin Grandalski on August 29, 1993, at the home of actor Henry Winkler, five days after her 28th birthday. They first met while she was filming a scene from \"Reasonable Doubts\" outside the studio grounds; the police department had assigned Grandalski to provide security and control traffic. They have four children: Sarah (born 1996), Brandon (born 2000), Tyler (born 2002), and Isabelle (born 2003).\n\nIn recognition of her philanthropic work and her advocacy for the inclusion of people with disabilities, Matlin received the 2016 Morton E.

Cameron was associated with the cocaine-fuelled ravages of the razor gang violence of that era, commonly associated with her contemporaries, Tilly Devine and Kate Leigh, both criminal entrepreneurs who controlled much of Sydney's illegal sex industry and Sly-grog distribution during that period. Nellie Cameron received 73 criminal convictions during her life of crime, mainly for soliciting and vagrancy, and had the distinction of becoming the first woman in Australia to be convicted of consorting with criminals.\n\nEllen (Nellie) Katherine Kelly was born in the inner city Sydney suburb of Waterloo in 1910, the youngest child of Colin Kelly, who later served in the AIF in World War I, and Lillian Kelly (née Ruddock), and the sister of Lionel, who was born in 1907, but died soon after, and William Colin, who was born in 1908, but who died of cerebral meningitis on 5 December 1910 in Bulli Cottage Hospital, NSW. Colin Kelly was later divorced by his wife, Lillian Kelly, on the grounds of desertion.\n\nAfter Nellie's mother married Robert George Cameron in 1922, Nellie took her stepfather's surname for most of her adult life. Cameron was a Roman Catholic and was educated at an exclusive girls' school on the North Shore.\n\nIn 1926 Cameron ran away from home, caught a train to the city, seduced a married tram driver, and began living with him in Woolloomooloo.\n\nWhen Cameron began her career in prostitution in 1926 in Sydney's Surry Hills and Woolloomooloo districts at the age of fifteen, she was a blue-eyed blonde. Soon Cameron became Sydney's most popular and most expensive prostitute and was known as Sydney's Underworld Beauty Queen and also as the \"Kiss Of Death Girl\" or \"The Angel Of Death\", as most of her boyfriends or husbands were subsequently murdered. During her years in crime, Cameron was kidnapped, beaten, stabbed, razor slashed, and shot on numerous occasions.\n\nEarly in 1927 when Cameron met Norman Bruhn (1894–1927), a Melbourne-born dockworker and gunman, thief, standover man and pimp feared for his garroting skills, who was forced to leave Melbourne by rival gunman Squizzy Taylor in November 1926, she was described as \"a redhead with a ripe figure and provocative china blue eyes\". At that time Cameron was a street prostitute on William and Palmer Streets with no connection to Tilly Devine or any other madam. Despite having a wife and children, Bruhn soon became Cameron's lover and pimp, although she also worked as a dance instructor at Professor Bolot's Academy in Sydney's Oxford Street, commuting between Sydney and Queensland on a regular basis. According to Larry Writer, Cameron \"perfected the age-old game called 'gingering' in Australia. During sex with one of her clients, an accomplice would emerge from beneath the bed and take the client's wallet from his pants or jacket. At that point, coitus would be interrupted by angry banging on the door by another involved in the scam, Cameron, feigning panic, would exclaim it was the police or her irate husband, and urge the client to dress and depart by the back door. Keen to avoid the embarrassment of public prosecution or a beating, the customer would flee and usually not notice until later that his wallet was missing.\" Cameron also was a cocaine runner and a fence for stolen property. Bruhn, who attempted to dominate the duopolised gangland milieu, was shot twice in the stomach outside a sly grog den in Charlotte Lane, Darlinghurst on 22 June 1927 by a hit squad sent by either Devine or Kate Leigh. and subsequently died in the early hours of 23 June 1927.\n\nWithin weeks of Bruhn's death, Cameron began a series of relationships with a successive string of other Sydney criminals: Ernest Lyle Connelly (1903–1969), shot in Womerah Avenue, Kings Cross by rival gunman and future husband, Guido Caletti (or Calletti) in February 1929; New Zealand-born housebreaker and standover man Alan Edward (Ted) Pulley, later shot dead by illegal bookmaker Florrie Riley at Wentworth Street, Glebe on 6 March 1937; and Francis Donald (Frank) Green, (1902–1956), Caletti's rival for Cameron's affections.\n\nOn 16 June 1931 Cameron, Green, and William Hourigan visited the Maroubra home of James Edward \"Big Jim\" Devine that he shared with his wife, Tilly Devine. After an altercation, Devine shot at the fleeing Cameron, Green, and Hourigan, and accidentally killed a taxi driver. Subsequently, on 11 July 1931 Green, Horigan and Cameron were charged with \"robbery under arms\", being accused of having assaulted Devine, whilst armed with a revolver, and robbing him of a diamond tiepin valued at £50. On 16 September the charges against Cameron and Hourigan were dismissed due to lack of evidence.\n\nOn 16 November 1931, after visiting her then de facto husband Frank Green at St. Vincent's Hospital where he was in a serious condition after being shot in the stomach, Nellie Cameron was herself shot in the shoulder in Burton Street, East Sydney whilst walking home from the hospital. Later, she refused to cooperate with police.\n\nCameron's first marriage was to the feared Sydney gangland figure Guido Caletti (1900–1939), who was the leader of a vicious Sydney gang known as the \"Darlinghurst Push\". The couple had fled New South Wales to Victoria due to outstanding arrest warrants. They married at the local registry office at Fitzroy, Victoria on 20 February 1934 with Nellie using her birth name, Ellen Kelly. In November 1934 Caletti was imprisoned for two years, and Cameron renewed her relationship with Frank Green.\n\nIn July 1937 Cameron was charged with maliciously shooting at Harry Roper the previous month.\n\nWhile Cameron was working as a prostitute in Queensland, Cameron's husband Guido Caletti was shot dead allegedly by two rival gunmen, Robert Branch and George Allan, at a party in Brougham Street, East Sydney on 6 August 1939.\n\nIn 1940 Cameron married Charles Francis \"Greyhound\" Bourke (1909–1964) (also known as Edward Brown and MacRogers), another notorious Sydney criminal and gunman, at Sydney, using her then married name of Ellen Catherine Caletti. The couple separated a few years later, although she retained the surname of Bourke until her death in 1953.\n\nAbout 1947 Cameron adopted Janice, the infant daughter of a neighbour, and raised her conscientiously.\n\nDuring 1951 Cameron began living with William Francis Donohue (born about 1922), a wharf labourer, at 17 Denham Street, Taylor Square. On 31 March 1952, Cameron was attacked at her flat by Donohue, who shot her in the stomach. Cameron was admitted to St Vincent's Hospital in a critical condition with a bullet lodged in her liver. Despite Bourke surrendering himself to police and informing them of the shooting, at trial Nellie would not give evidence against him and the case collapsed. Upon surgery to remove the bullets, it was found that Cameron had several healed bullet wounds in her body, possibly sustained from the attack in 1931. Unfortunately, however, some of them had become sites for cancerous growths and they had become inoperable.\n\nAfter severe illness and suffering from depression, Nellie Cameron committed suicide through gas asphyxiation at her Taylor Square flat on 8 November 1953.\n\nNellie was buried as Ellen Katherine Bourke on 10 November 1953 in the Botany Roman Catholic Cemetery, now known as Eastern Suburbs Memorial Park. Over 700 mourners attended her funeral including Kate Leigh, Tilly Devine and ex lover Frank Green. She was survived by her estranged husband Charlie Bourke, her mother, Mrs Lillian Cameron and her adopted daughter, Janice.\n\n\n"}

She lived predominantly in South London. Leaving school without qualifications, she later went on to study at the London College of Printing.\n\nOn November 15, 1969, Nigerian Diplomat Clement Gomwalk was confronted by police while parked outside the Desmond's Hip City record store. The police dragged him out of his car to interrogate him and then when unsatisfied by his responses continued to beat him as a crowd formed around them to witness the police brutality.\nThere are different accounts of Morris' involvement which are stated below\n\nLocal Journalist Aymo Martin Tajo states that Morris \"broke to the crowd to the scuffle\" and \"tried to physically stop the police from beating the Nigerian\", the police reaction being to beat her also.\n\nMorris' account stated that she did not arrive till after the diplomat had been taken away by the police. The situation with the police escalated after the crowd began to confront the police about their brutality. She recals her friend being dragged into the record store by police shouting \"I've done nothing\". She does not state how she got involved but does state that she was brutally beaten.\nHer account goes on to describe her treatment in prison. She was forced to strip and was threatened with rape in police custody; \"They all made me take off my jumper and my bra in front of them to show I was a girl. A male cop holding a billy club said, ‘Now prove you’re a real woman.’\" referencing his billy club he stated: \"Look it’s the right colour and the right size for you. Black cunt!\"\n\nOlive's brother Basil Morris described her injuries from the incident and time with the police: \"could hardly recognize her face, they beat her so badly.\"\n\nShe was arrested, fined £10 and given a suspended sentence. The charges were: assault on the police, threatening behaviour, and possession of dangerous weapons.\n\nIn the early 1970's Olive became a member of the youth section of the British Black Panther Movement (later the Black Workers movement), alongside Linton Kwesi Johnson, Clovis Reid, and Farrukh Dhondy.\nIn August 1972 she and a friend, Liz Obi, planned to visit the American Black Panther leader, Eldridge Cleaver, who was in exile in Algeria, but they became stranded in Morocco.\n\nShe was a founding member of the Brixton Black Women's Group.\n\nOlive squatted at 121 Railton Road, Brixton with her friend Liz Obi in 1973.

His chief role was to ferry gunpowder from the powder magazine in the ship's hold to the artillery pieces, either in bulk or as cartridges, to minimize the risk of fires and explosions. The function was usually fulfilled by boy seamen of 12 to 14 years of age. Powder monkeys were usually boys or young teens, selected for the job for their speed and height: they were short and could move more easily in the limited space between decks and would also be hidden behind the ship's gunwale, keeping them from being shot by enemy ships' sharp shooters. These powder monkeys held no official naval rank on the ships that they sailed on. Some women and older men also worked as powder monkeys.\n\nMany of the powder monkeys in the British Navy that ended up on ships were part of the poor working class. The Marine Society that promoted youths to join the British Royal Navy recruited them by providing clothes, bedding, and a rudimentary education. In the mid-1790s it is estimated that the Marine Society was sending five or six hundred boys a year to the fleet although not all of these boys became powder monkeys. Of the boys who were recruited by the Marine Society; most had no other option than to join the navy as their parents could not afford to raise them. However a significant amount had familial ties to the sea. This group had cousins, fathers, and even grandfathers were sailors thus making them want to continue family traditions and exploit their sense of adventure.\n\nThe United States did not have an established navy until after its independence in 1776 and even then it was loosely organized. The United States Navy started using powder monkeys in the late 1700s after modeling its structure off of the Royal Navy. The nations fought against each other in the War of 1812. During which time both sides utilized the special physical gifts that powder monkeys offered on board of their warships. After the War of 1812 boys under the age of twelve were outlawed by the U.S. Navy to serve on ships. However boys above that age were still used as powder monkeys until the Spanish-American War at the end of the nineteenth century. \n\nThe Royal Navy first began using the term \"powder monkey\" in the 17th century. The term was later used, and continues to be used in some countries, to signify a skilled technician or engineer who engages in blasting work, such as in the mining or demolition industries. In such industries, a \"powder monkey\" is also sometimes referred to as a \"blaster\".\n\n"}

He currently resides in the city of Parma, a suburb located in the city of Cleveland.\n\nHe also raised awareness for formerly missing female \"Amanda Berry\" after her abduction by writing letters to the city police department and holding candlelight vigils in her memory.\nHe has also helmed an ongoing battle against the use of Chief Wahoo as the Cleveland Indians baseball team mascot. He has publicly participated in protests against the use of the Chief Wahoo mascot since 1973. He also founded the group \"People, Not Mascots\", a cohort which is dedicated to raise awareness against the use of a race of people as mascots and end the current use of offensive Native American imagery. As he explained, \"We are not mascots. I'm nobody's mascot. My children are not mascots. \"It mocks us as a race of people. It mocks our religion.\" \nA protest being held by Roche on 4 April 2014 against the Cleveland's home opening against the Minnesota Twins at Progressive Field went viral and gained international attention after a man adorned in Redface regalia, approached Roche. The Cleveland Indian's fan, Pedro Rodriguez, was introduced to Roche by a sports blogger who was working in tandem with filmmaker Brian Spaeth to create a documentary on the use of the Chief Wahoo mascot.\n\nOn 25 June 2014, major news media outlets began reporting that Robert Roche would file a lawsuit against the Cleveland Indians organization in July. Roche would be suing the team in excess of $9 billion. According to Roche, compensation would be sought based on the length of time and exploitation which has occurred from the use of the mascot. \"We're going to be asking for $9 billion and we're basing it on a hundred years of disparity, racism, exploitation and profiteering,\" Roche said. \"It's been offensive since day one. We are not mascots. My children are not mascots. We are people.\"\n\nRobert Roche has been the subject of criticism from some members within the Cleveland Native American community. Philip Joseph Yenyo, an Aztec Indian, protester, and member of the American Indian Movement of Ohio, claimed that Roche had constructed a false identity, claiming to have a birth certificate which reveals that Robert Roche was really Jose Roche. However, when asked to validate the nature of the injurious claims, Yenyo was unable to substantiate his accusations with material evidence. Roche has also been accused by members of the Native American community of using the Center as a platform for himself while failing to provide a consistent regimen of services. Roche was also asked by one of the founders of the original American Indian Movement to stop identifying himself as a member of the organization. According to Vernon Bellecourt, Robert Roche had never been an AIM representative in Ohio. \"We have known for some time that he was invoking the name of AIM,\" Bellcourt said. \"We feel if people are doing good work in our name, it's OK. But that is not the case with Roche. We received complaints about him from leaders of the Indian community, and that was enough to cause us to issue the letter.\" Despite identifying himself as a representative of the Autonomous America Indian Movement, Roche would also state that he was representative or executive director of Cleveland AIM, even doing so in a resume where he describes himself as an \"appointed American Indian Movement executive director - Cleveland Ohio, 1994-present.\"\n\nThere have also questions raised about the use of grant funds allocated to the American Indian Education Center Roche operates. The Ohio Attorney General's Office launched an investigation into the use of the Center's finances following a 2013 anonymous complaint that alleged the American Indian Education Center mishandled the grant money it had been appropriated, and the fact Roche paid $153,00.00 in salary and benefits to himself that year, according to the tax filing. Closer examination to the available financial records, however, showed that Roche paid himself in relative proportion of grant funding allocated to the organization. In 2012, the American Indian Education Center received $650,000.00 in grant funding, an elevated increase in comparison from previous years. This was due largely to a Department of Education grant aimed at improving education for impoverished and underprivileged kids. In 2011, when the center was allocated $235,000.00 in grant funding, Roche paid himself only $37,000.00. Prior to that year, in 2010, when the Center was allocated $42,000.00 in grants, Roche, who served as the executive director, and the sole full-time employee on staff (who also worked seven days a week), paid himself only $12,000.00. During that same year, he also wrote a $16,000.00 loan for the center. On the tax filing, under \"purpose,\" it read: \"Keep Center Open.\"\n\nNew details into the mismanagement of money allocated to the American Indian Education Center have slowly emerged. It was revealed that the inspector general for the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services also launched an independent investigation into the American Indian Education Center. According to the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA) starting in 2011. The Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration, which is a branch of the U.S. Department of Health, had provided thousands of dollars to the American Indian Education Center from 2011 onwards. However, due to the placement of a \"high risk restriction\" on the Center, access to the SAMHSA grant money was on a limited basis. The investigation also cites the lack of proper financial management to administer the federal grant. The probe has also identified certain irregularities into the expenditure of funds provided by the SAMHSA. These irregularities included the $136,000.00 salary Roche paid himself in 2012, which did not appear to be concordant with wages supplied in grant documentation provided by the American Indian Education Center, the flat fees paid to the center's grant writer, McGuire & Associates, are inconsistent with standard practice, and the Center's bylaws giving Roche governing authority and control over his board of directors, are not in keeping with federal guidelines, which state that the board should operate independently of its director. There are also matters of personnel costs, related taxes and fringe benefit payments that The Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration is looking into.\n\nOne grant received by the American Indian Education Center received in 2012 carried over into 2013. However, the rant was terminated by the grantor, the Ohio Department of Education, which decided that the program being funded by the grant was ineffective. Roche also made an attempt to open a second education center for American Indian people in the city of Columbus, Ohio in spite of financial difficulties faced during 2012. Although he cited poor health and financial difficulties, Roche registered a 1989 Jaguar in the \"unfinished\" Columbus Center's name in December 2012. According to Roche, he donated the car to the center, where he plans to raffle the vehicle in the name of American Indian services.\n\n\n"}

It is a conflation of \"The War of the Worlds\", the Cthulhu Mythos, and the biography of H. P. Lovecraft.\n\nThe story begins on August 12, 1898, twenty-nine days after the death of eight-year-old Howard Philip Lovecraft's father. Howard observes a Martian cylinder crash into Federal Hill, an event that he had been predicting in his dreams for three years. Being a \"gentleman of pure Yankee stock [of] the true chalk-white Nordic type\" Howard decides to investigate the landing, and witnesses the opening of the cylinder and emergence of the Martian occupants. When the Martians fire upon onlookers with their heat rays, he faints.\n\nHoward reawakens three days later in his home. His mother, blissfully ignorant of the danger in staying behind in Martian-occupied Providence, informs him that he was taken into the Martian cylinder, before being rescued by a Brown University librarian named Armitage. Howard observes the spread of the red weed and the movement of fighting machines and feels an intense longing to explore the crash site, but realizes that his mother will not let him. He resorts to drugging her with a sedative in her malted milk, before heading out into the city.\n\nHoward arrives at St. John's Church, where he witnesses a tripod placing an artifact into the steeple and to which he feels the strong pull. Climbing to its top, he finds a glowing trapezohedron accompanied by a strange sound of distant flutes. Picking up the object, Lovecraft is surrounded by a shifting, sentient unearthly colour. It asks if he is \"one of us,\" stating that prior to the invasion, a number of Martian minds were telepathically sent to occupy human bodies to report, with some failing to return. It begins to relate the story of the \"Martians\" history to Howard.\n\nThe species originated in another solar system, emigrating to this one ages ago. They established two colonies, one on Mars that thrived and one in an area of Antarctica that was destroyed due to climate change. The survivors on Mars engaged in selective breeding programs that created an advanced, immortal physical form. As a side effect, some Martians developed the capability to engage in astral projection, and made contact with the other two races of the system: Humans on Earth, and a \"fungoid race\" on a distant planet.\n\nThe Martians engaged in trade with the fungoid race, entering a golden age and building \"labyrinthine Cyclopean structures\" before entering a decline marked with a population shrinkage and increasingly decadent artwork. However, this collapse ends with a discovery beneath Syrtis Major: an underground series of impenetrable vaults that the fungoid beings explained as being the home of the elder godlike beings that were Mars's first masters, and would return from their undead dreaming when the stars were aligned.\n\nThis discovery sent the normally cool and calculating Martians into a frenzy of terror, and they destroyed as many of the elder gods' idols as they could find, before finally deciding to leave Mars for Earth, where the elder gods have no interest. It was for this reason that the Martians sent out their psychic spies - of which Howard apparently was one. By this time, the colour out of space begins to fade, and Howard finds himself on Mars, in a vast hall filled with \"mathematically-perfect music\". Howard enters the hall, and as he does, the Martian inhabitants begin to exit in fear; Howard realized the cause when he looks up and sees that one of the feared elder gods is standing within the hall. Howard approaches it - and realizes that he is standing before a mirror.\n\nThe narration states that the shock of this sent Howard back to Earth, with no memories of the event, and in later years he became one of the skeptics who claimed there had never been a Martian invasion of the Earth.\n\n"}

Barrett\n\nSir William Fletcher Barrett (10 February 1844 in Kingston, Jamaica – 26 May 1925) was an English physicist and parapsychologist.\n\nHe was born in Jamaica where his father, William Garland Barrett, who was an amateur naturalist, Congregationalist minister and a member of the London Missionary Society, ran a station for saving African slaves. There he lived with his mother, Martha Barrett, née Fletcher, and a brother and sister. The family returned to their native England in Royston, Hertfordshire in 1848 where another sister, the social reformer Rosa Mary Barrett was born. In 1855 they moved to Manchester and Barrett was then educated at Old Trafford Grammar School.\n\nBarrett then took chemistry and physics at the Royal College of Chemistry and then became the science master at the London International College (1867–9) before becoming assistant to John Tyndall at the Royal Institution (1863–1866). He then taught at the Royal School of Naval Architecture.\n\nIn 1873 he became Professor of Experimental Physics at the Royal College of Science for Ireland. From the early 1880s he lived with his mother, sister, and two live-in servants in a residence at Kingstown (now Dún Laoghaire). Barrett discovered Stalloy (see Permalloy), a silicon-iron alloy used in electrical engineering and also did a lot of work on sensitive flames and their uses in acoustic demonstrations. During his studies of metals and their properties, Barrett worked with W. Brown and R. A. Hadfield. He also discovered the shortening of nickel through magnetisation in 1882.\n\nWhen Barrett developed cataracts in his later years, he also began to study biology with a series of experiments designed to locate and successfully analyze causative agents within the eyes. The result of these experiments was a machine called the entoptiscope. He was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society in June 1899 and was also a fellow of the Royal Society of Edinburgh and the Royal Dublin Society. He was knighted in 1912. He married Florence Willey in 1916. He died at home, 31 Devonshire Place in London.\n\nBarrett's last book, \"Christian Science: An Examination of the Religion of Health\" was completed and published after his death in 1926 by his sister Rosa M. Barrett.\n\nBarrett became interested in the paranormal in the 1860s after having an experience with mesmerism. Barrett believed that he had been witness to thought transference and by the 1870s he was investigating poltergeists. In September 1876 Barrett published a paper outlining the result of these investigations and by 1881 he had published preliminary accounts of his additional experiments with thought transference in the journal \"Nature\". The publication caused controversy and in the wake of this Barrett decided to found a society of like-minded individuals to help further his research. Barrett held conference between 5–6 January 1882 in London. In February the Society for Psychical Research (SPR) was formed.\n\nBarrett was a Christian and spiritualist member of the SPR. Although he had founded the society, Barrett was only truly active for a year, and in 1884 founded the American Society for Psychical Research. He became president of the society in 1904 and continued to submit articles to their journal. From 1908–14 Barrett was active in the Dublin Section of the Society for Psychical Research, a group which attracted many important members including Sir John Pentland Mahaffy, T.W. Rolleston, Sir Archibald Geikie, and Lady Augusta Gregory.\n\nIn the late 19th century the Creery Sisters (Mary, Alice, Maud, Kathleen, and Emily) were tested by Barrett and other members of the SPR who believed them to have genuine psychic ability, however, the sisters later confessed to fraud by describing their method of signal codes that they had utilized. Barrett and the other members of the SPR such as Edmund Gurney and Frederic W. H. Myers had been easily duped.\n\nAs a believer in telepathy, Barrett denounced the muscle reading of Stuart Cumberland and other magicians as \"pseudo\" thought readers.\n\nBarrett helped to publish Frederick Bligh Bond's book \"Gate of Remembrance\" (1918) which was based on alleged psychical excavations at Glastonbury Abbey. Barrett endorsed the claims of the book and testified to Bond's sincerity. However, professional archaeologists and skeptics have found Bond's claims dubious.\n\nIn 1919, Barrett wrote the introduction to medium Hester Dowden's book \"Voices from the Void\".\n\nBarrett held a special interest in divining rods and in 1897 and 1900 he published two articles on the subject in Proceedings of the SPR. He co-authored the book \"The Divining-Rod\" (1926), with Theodore Besterman.\n\nBarrett rejected any physical theory for dowsing such as radiation. He concluded that the ideomotor response was responsible for the movement of the rod but in some cases the dowser's unconscious could pick up information by clairvoyance.\n\nBarrett has drawn criticism from researchers and skeptics as being overly credulous for endorsing spiritualist mediums and not detecting trickery that occurred in the séance room. For example, author Ronald Pearsall wrote that Barrett was duped into believing spiritualism by mediumship trickery.\n\nSkeptic Edward Clodd criticized Barrett as being an incompetent researcher to detect fraud and claimed his spiritualist beliefs were based on magical thinking and primitive superstition. Another skeptic Joseph McCabe wrote that Barrett \"talks nonsense of which he ought to be ashamed\" as he had poor understanding of conjuring tricks and failed to detect the fraud of the medium Kathleen Goligher.\n\nPsychical researcher Helen de G. Verrall gave Barrett's book \"Psychical Research\" a positive review describing it as a \"clear, careful account of some of main achievements of psychical research by one who has himself taken part in these achievements and speaks to a large extent from personal knowledge and observation.\" However, in the \"British Medical Journal\" the book was criticized for ignoring critical work on the subject and being \"a negative assault on scientific method generally\".\n\n\n"}
{"id": "54561571", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=54561571", "title": "Women in Latin music", "text": "Women in Latin music\n\nWomen have made significant contributions to Latin music, a genre which predates Italian explorer Christopher Columbus' arrival in Latin America in 1492 and the Spanish colonization of the Americas. The earliest musicians were Native Americans, hundreds of ethnic groups across the continent, whose lyrics \"reflect conflict, beauty, pain, and loss that mark all human experience.\" Indigenous communities reserved music for women, who were given equal opportunities with men to teach, perform, sing, and dance. Ethnomusicologists have measured ceramic, animal-bone, and cane flutes from the Inca Empire which indicate a preference for women with a high vocal range. Women had equal social status, were trained, and received the same opportunities in music as men in indigenous communities until the arrival of Columbus in the late 15th century. European settlers brought patriarchal, machismo ideologies to the continent, replacing the idea of equality between men and women. They equated native music with \"savagery\" and European music with \"civilization\". Female musicians tended to be darker-skinned as a result of the slave trade (which increased the population of African slaves), and contemporary society denigrated music as a profession. Latin music became Africanized, with syncopated rhythms and call-and-response; European settlement introduced harmony and the Spanish décima song form.\n\nSince the pre-recording era of music, Latin music was male-dominated, and there are relatively few examples of female songwriters, music producers, record executives, and promoters. Women lacked access to musical training; music programs were nonexistent, and cultural norms discouraged female participation. Latin music had a primarily male presence; men discriminated against women, limiting them to singing or dancing and discouraging them from becoming instrumentalists, writers, composers, arrangers, and executives. Women artists in the sub-genres of Latin music, such as Selena, Jenni Rivera, Jennifer Lopez, Ivy Queen, Julieta Venegas, and Ely Guerra. have been credited with enhancing the genres' female presence; they have broken through barriers, reshaping Latin music and public perceptions of female sexuality, gender, and femininity. Women in salsa music are significantly underrepresented in the industry as very few women, with the exception of Celia Cruz, have been associated with the emergence of the genre; for example, in the British documentary \"Salsa: Latin Pop Music in the Cites\" (1985), Cruz is one of the only female singers who is mentioned.\n\nWomen Latin singers have a significant demographic imbalance on \"Billboard\" music charts compared with their male counterparts. As radio formats explore genres popularized and led by men, such as reggaeton and regional Mexican music, women on the \"Billboard\" Latin music charts are periodically absent. The last female singer with a number-one single was Sofia Reyes, whose collaborative \"Solo Yo\" ended a five-year drought on the Latin Pop Songs chart in 2016. A year earlier, on the 50-position Hot Latin Songs chart, 22 weeks passed without a song by a women. Reyes has expressed concern about the disparity between male and female performances at Latin music award shows, noting that 90 percent of the performers are male. Other female singers, such as Chiquis Rivera, have attributed the decline in visibility of women in Latin music to sexist radio programmers. Latin music executive Alexandra Lioutikoff believes that the decline is due to a lack of female collaboration. Latin music remains male-dominated, and the music industry has \"prejudiced practice\" limiting female recording artists.\n\nLatin American music is varied; it includes thirty countries, influenced by European, African, and Amerindian cultures. Latin music uses two European languages: Spanish and Portuguese, though modern-day widely distinguishes the genre as primarily sung or recorded in Spanish and to a lesser extent French and Italian. Although heterogeneous, Latin music commonly includes the Spanish décima song form, African syncopated rhythms and call-and-response, and European harmony.\n\nPre-modern Latin music refers to music made by Native Americans, hundreds of ethnic groups across the continent. The first inhabitants of Latin America settled 30,000 years before the arrival of Italian explorer Christopher Columbus at the peak of native cultural diversification into simple and complex societies. These societies included sedentary agricultural tribes and hunter gatherers, who sang prayers to a deity asking for prosperity with lyrics of \"conflict, beauty, pain, and loss that mark all human experience\" and music reflecting their understanding of the universe. They had \"intricate ways of explaining the relationships between the sound, social organization, time, and the sacred\", and their rituals included dramatized performances of mythology vocalizing their view of creation. The creation myth of the Keres people of Laguna Pueblo (present west-central New Mexico) describes \"the unformed cosmos as the domain of Tse che nako (Thought Woman or Spider Woman) who chants life into two sacred bundles that become the sisters Uretsete and Naosete (She Who Matters and She Who Remembers).\"\n\nIndigenous communities predating Columbus' arrival reserved music for women, although men were equally involved in dance. During the Inca Empire in the mid-14th century, women from royal families and selected \"acallas\" (chosen ones) were taught science, art, poetry, and music from \"wise elders\". The \"chosen ones\" were selected for their beauty and \"quality of their voices.\" There were six houses, one of which was called the \"taquiaclla\" (\"taqui\" means \"song\"), which housed girls aged nine to fifteen with \"gifted\" singing voices. The Andeans preferred young women with a high vocal range. Although no scripts or musical notation survive, archaeologists have uncovered a variety of ceramic, animal bone, and cane flutes. Ethnomusicologists who have measured the flutes have found their pitch compatible with a high vocal range. Women in these communities were well-treated, with equal opportunities to teach, perform, sing, and dance (as soloists, with other women, or in pairs with men). Female singers had a social status equal to men, receiving musical training and opportunities with their male counterparts.\n\nColumbus' arrival in 1492 and the Spanish colonization of the Americas brought patriarchy and machismo to the continent, overriding sexual equality. Early Spanish music described women as \"property and mistrusted [by men].\" In a song, \"Delgadina\", women are servants who must please their men \"no matter the cost.\" According to author Janet Sturman, the Iberian idea of machismo (in which a strong man is superior to others, including women) was held by the conquistadors. Europeans who settled in the New World associated native music with \"savagery\" and European music with \"civilization\". During the slave trade, musicians in Latin America primarily had a dark complexion. This was due to an increased population of African slaves and contemporary society's view of music as a profession. Most slaves arriving in Brazil were \"bi-musical\", and introduced their music to the country. Rural Quechua-speaking Bolivian farmers sang about European resistance in songs with Native American and European influences. Black Bolivians sang songs with lyrics reflecting a European influence, performed as Africanized European music.\n\nIn colonial Latin America, nuns wrote, directed, and performed music. They played a variety of instruments, including the clavichord, harp, flageolet, and flute. The nuns played in front of spectators, choirs, and high-ranking government officials. Musically-adept, underprivileged women were allowed to perform during the nuns' Christmas recital. Performances were often \"feminine acts\", such as sewing, embroidery, bakery, and selling \"special confections.\" For two hundred years in Latin America, the \"elite woman\" was educated in the arts; \"the rest\" were consigned to cooking, sewing, spinning, weaving, embroidery, and music. In 17th- and 18th-century Mexico City, music was often heard by visitors. The music emanated from cathedral choirs, indigenous dancers, or black musicians organized in the city. During the 17th century, Europeans and their descendants wrote and performed music at cathedrals in Mexico's cities which was repeated in song by blacks, mulattos, indigenous Mexicans, Asians, and ethnicities. In 1690, Mexican author Sor Juana Inés de la Cruz wrote secular and religious poetry, plays, philosophy, and theology. She often discussed topics ranging from mathematics to music with visitors, had no interest in marriage and wanted to pursue \"a life of the mind.\" Although her views were suppressed, de la Cruz defended women's rights in education.\n\nAt a 1691 celebration, European traveler Juan de Galde described his participation in dancing and singing and placing a scapular on two young women in Mexico. A Mexican singer named Reina performed for six hours, which made \"the event more enjoyable\". The \"wild\" celebration banned Jamaicans from entry. In 1697, Neapolitan chronicler Gemelli Carreri wrote during his trip off the coast of the Dominican Republic that he saw a canoe of musicians trying to outdo each other in singing and drawing attention to their \"perfection\". In 1799 Buenos Aires, privileged women were encouraged to educate themselves in the arts. The government required that women be taught to read and write, in addition to physical education and music.\n\nSince the arrival of European settlers, Latin music has been male-dominated. Musical training was nonexistent for women. Male predominance in the genre left \"power imbalances that acted as barriers to women's participation in Latin music.\" Despite this barrier, women have become successful. Under the authority of men, they were limited to roles as vocalists or dancers rather than instrumentalists, writers, composers, arrangers, and executives. According to musicologist Ilan Stavans, female roles were related to traditional norms; \"decent women\" cared for their children and remained at home, cleaning and cooking. Women's dance routines were a growing concern among female fans and performers. Female dancers, more closely scrutinized than males, were expected to follow \"normative gender expectations\" and exhibit \"appropriate behavior\". Although male dancers typically performed suggestively, women who danced similarly were accused of being \"loose\" or \"slack\".\n\nAccording to author Lise Waxer, Cuban trova singer María Teresa Vera is the \"great-grandmother of all Latin women singers\". \"Arroz Con Leche\" (\"Rice Pudding\"), which advises the listener to find a spouse who will take care of them, was criticized by feminist groups. Bolero lyrics have a central theme of women as the object of male desire, unrequited love, and abandonment, portraying women as \"physical absence and emotional distance, as ungrateful beings\" unequipped to love a man. Cuban singer La Lupe \"pushed the boundaries\" of bolero music, and was called the queen of Latin soul music. She toured the U.S. with bandleader Tito Puente, and was one of the most popular Latin performers of the 1960s. In her youth she dominated local singing competitions, which inspired her to pursue a career in music despite her parents' desire for her to become a teacher. After divorcing her first husband, La Lupe began a solo career and performed in Havana nightclubs. Her popularity grew, and she owned and operated a nightclub in Cuba which was seized by the Castro government. La Lupe emigrated to the United States, settled in New York in 1962 and began touring the country with other bolero and salsa performers. She released several salsa albums with \"devotional lyrics.\" Her concert requests began diminishing at the turn of the 1970s as her savings drained because of her second husband's failing health. She ended her professional career in a wheelchair at a final, 1985 concert with Puente to help pay her medical expenses. La Lupe, who devoted her remaining years to Christian music in the Bronx, died of cardiac arrest in February 1992. Cuban singers Rita Montaner and Celeste Mendoza were involved in the \"appropriation and rearticulation of rumba\", a genre popular before salsa.\nAs salsa music grew in popularity, Celia Cruz emerged during the 1950s and was known as the queen of the genre. Although Cruz was instrumental in popularizing and developing male-dominated salsa, few other women are associated with it. She was the only female singer featured in the British documentary, \"Salsa: Latin Pop Music in the Cities\" (1985), which noted the absence of women in the industry. According to the documentary, women were \"not trained in popular music and that women dared not improvise—\"sonear\" (closeness)—on stage\". Cruz crossed boundaries set by public expectations for music performed at nightclubs, but she was the exception who proved the rule. Opportunities for all-female salsa bands were nonexistent; gender discrimination flourished in the market, and women were seen as \"less competent than their male counterparts.\" In 1977 Cruz recorded \"Usted Abusó\", which gave a voice to battered women. The 1980s saw the emergence of salsa romántica, which was \"deemed as homogenized, depoliticized, and ultimately, feminized.\"\n\nDuring the 1990s women began playing a larger role in salsa music, increasing the genre's popularity, and female salsa singers broke \"the sexist boundaries of the [Latin] music industry\". Although women singers were becoming more popular, images of men were emphasized to the public more than those of women. La India, Corinne, Brenda K. Starr, Lissette Melendez, and Yolanda la Duke were instrumental in refining salsa in that decade, although all were managed by men. Their new salsa sound was influenced by African American music (hip-hop, R&B, gospel, jazz, and soul), which revolutionized traditional 1970s salsa. According to author Lise Waxer, a \"careful and attentive listening\" of their recordings indicated the \"female authority and influence—a female genealogy—of salsa music.\" Salsa's leading female singer was La India, who developed salsa romantica music during the 1990s and whose lyrics \"turn the tables\" on the male salsa narrative of women as objects of desire, \"cruel and evil or idealized and unattainable.\" In her most-popular song, \"Ese Hombre\" (originally recorded by Rocío Jurado), La India contradicts male stereotypes. The song's lyrics describe a man who is \"a fool/stupid and conceited/selfish and capricious\", reversing male \"discursive terrorism\" toward their female partners. La India has been compared to Celia Cruz as leaders in their respective eras, and to La Lupe in musical style: \"nasal style of singing, growls, and screams that evoke an androgynous style rather than a soft melodious tone.\"\n\nIn her Spanish-language debut, Gloria Estefan released \"Mi Tierra\" (1993). It was a commercial success, debuting atop the new US \"Billboard\" Top Latin Albums chart. Estefan has been described by her Latin pop contemporaries as performing pop ballads and soft rock. She has also ventured into salsa and merengue music, using salsa in her English-language compositions; \"Conga\" brought her to European clubs. The rural Cuban genre guajira offered a musical identity to Afro-Cubans; Albita Rodriguez became popular, and was named one of the top 100 personalities of the 20th century by \"Newsweek\" magazine. Most of her repertoire are love songs with \"openly erotic lyrics\" with hetero- and homosexual themes.\n\nThe duo of Monchy y Alexandra \"established bachata as a 'nice' music that could be listened to in the home by women and children.\" Women \"embraced [the] clean-up\"; the romantic bachata style, with emotive lyrics, expressed longing for a lost lover. In 1950s bachata music, women were accused of \"treachery or promiscuity or, in more humorous moments, referring to their sexuality and sexual organs with thinly veiled double entendres.\" The lyrics were rooted in an era where women in the workplace became more common, displacing men as breadwinners.\n\nIn 19th-century merengue music, a man \"won the love of woman\" by dancing. Modern merengue (a party genre) lyrics explored the \"vicissitudes of urban life [and] employed skillful wordplay and humorous double entendres about women and sex.\" Because of the genre's \"air of male-dominated sexuality\", Dominican men believed that making merengue music is \"no fitting occupation for women.\" According to Santo Domingans, listening to merengue music \"is only for men\" and a woman who enjoys the music is considered \"a crazy girl [and] a bad girl.\" During the 1970s, attitudes toward women and merengue music changed with the changing roles of women in Dominican society. All-female merengue bands emerged in the 1980s, beginning with Las Chicas Del Can in 1984. Participation in merengue increased in 1990, with women playing percussion and brass instruments formerly considered too difficult for women.\n\nFemale merengue bands were often formed by successful male merengue musicians, who \"often referred to them as the property of the [male musicians who formed them].\" The mainly-female merengue band Milly, Jocelyn y Los Vecinos formed after Las Chicas del Can. The group became popular, despite not setting out to challenge existing gender roles. Feminists have noted the \"limited values\" in merengue recordings by women, since most of their songs are written by men who \"do not resolutely challenge patriarchal attitudes.\" Olga Tañón was the most successful female merengue artist in the 1990s, and has been called the queen of merengue music. Tañón has been credited with popularizing merengue in Puerto Rico, a salsa-dominated market. Her 1994 album, \"Siente el Amor\", outsold her previous recordings: \"Mujer de Fuego\" (1993) and her platinum-certified debut studio album, \"Sola\" (1992).\n\nSince the beginning of radio women have been accepted as mariachi singers, often performing duets with men. The Mexican quintet Las Coronelas, formed by María Carlota Noriega during the 1940s, was the first mariachi all-female band. The first all-female ranchera band, Las Generales (formed by Elena Muñoz), consisted of wives and mothers of male professional mariachi musicians. The group was criticized by the public for playing in \"cantinas\" (bars), and their partners destroyed their instruments. Other all-female bands tried unsuccessfully to be pioneers. Four of the six-member Mariachi Estrella de Topeka and 110 others were killed in the 1981 Hyatt Regency walkway collapse. Rebecca Gonzales, who later joined the Los Angeles Uclatlan band, was the first female mariachi violinist. According to Gonzales, the other members of Uclatlan found it \"bizarre\" that a woman was playing with them and it took the group about a month to accept her. Gonzales was the first female mariachi musician to break through professionally. A role model for female mariachi hopefuls, she was inducted into the Mariachi Hall of Fame in Tucson, Arizona in 2004. Eva Ybarra mastered the accordion at a young age and began performing with her parents during the 1940s. The 1962 film \"El Mariachi Canta\" pokes fun at the rarity of female mariachi singers, with men cross-dressing as women.\n\nLinda Ronstadt debuted on the Latin-music scene with \"Canciones de Mi Padre\" (1987), credited with inspiring a mariachi renaissance in the United States. Other moderately-successful mariachi singers are educator and Mariachi Hall of Famer Laura Sobrino, Cindy Reifer, Marisa Orduno, trumpeter Cindy Shea, Patricia Martin, and Judith Kamel. In corrido, a ballad form consisting of four-line verses, women played supporting roles as mothers, wives \"or represented the subject of the protagonist's affections.\" Female soldiers in the Mexican Revolution were styled as \"corridistas\". Women were discouraged from playing and singing Tejano music due to Tejano patriarchy. Only a handful of female Tejano singers, including Chavela Ortiz, Lisa Lopez, Patsy Torres, Laura Canales, and Elsa Garcia, were successful in the genre before it became popular. Other female singers who were moderately successful during the Tejano golden age were Shelly Lares, Stefani Montiel, Mary Lee Ochoa, and Stephanie Lynn. \n\nAt the turn of the decade, Tejano music was the fastest-growing music genre in the United States. The American singer Selena dominated Tejano music, bringing it mainstream success. During her early career, she was often turned down by music venues because of her age and her fronting of a Tejano band. Selena's father, Abraham Quintanilla, Jr. was told that she would not be successful because she was a woman. She was the first female Tejano singer to receive gold and platinum certifications, the first female Tejano singer to receive a Grammy Award for Best Mexican American Album, the first Tejano singer to top the US \"Billboard\" Top Latin Albums chart, and the first female to outsell male Tejano singers. After Selena's 1995 murder, Tejano music waned in popularity. Selena's popularity increased after her death, and she is the only Tejano singer with constant appearances on the US \"Billboard\" 200. Her posthumously-released album, \"Dreaming of You\" (1995), was the first recording by a Hispanic singer to debut atop the \"Billboard\" 200 chart. Selena's music explored love, pain, strength and passion, and \"Billboard\" called her the best-selling Latin artist of the 1990s. Latin music entered the mainstream market in the late 1990s, believed by music critics to be due to the death of Selena and the emergence of Ricky Martin, Christina Aguilera, Jennifer Lopez and Marc Anthony, with greater commercial success and worldwide recognition than ever before.\n\nAs Tejano music declined in popularity, norteño music was pioneered by Lydia Mendoza and Alicia Villareal. Although Ilan Stavans found it challenging to describe Mexican singer Jenni Rivera as a feminist, he found that her recordings sparked debate in the Latino community about women's roles. Debuting on the music scene in 1994, Rivera's music \"addresses the lives of men and women of humble backgrounds\". She was commercially successful as a vocalist in the regional Mexican music scene and its subgenres, banda, conjunto (small band) and Tejano, before her 2012 death in a plane crash. Mexican singer Lila Downs debuted on the Latin-music scene with her album, \"Ofrenda\", in 1994. Downs, a prolific innovator, popularized Latin folk music in recordings blending folk instrumentals with Oaxaca references.\n\nAna Bárbara is the leading female in grupera, a regional Mexican folk genre, and Jennifer Peña was called \"one of Latin music's most promising female singers\" by \"Billboard\" magazine. The mid-2000s decline of women in regional Mexican music slowed, with greater representation by Graciela Beltran, Yolanda Perez, Los Horóscopos de Durango, Diana Reyes, and Jenni Rivera.\n\nAs hip-hop and rap became popular in the United States during the 1990s, Latin singers began emulating them. Men dominated the Latin urban scene; women were objectified, seen as accessories indicating male status. Unlike the hip-hop and rap music scenes, their Latin equivalents did not formulate a female role model; female Latina urban singers failed to attain commercial success. During the popularity of Latin freestyle (also called freestyle music or Latin hip-hop) in the 1980s, record companies began signing \"attractive young women with little musical talent using the same production style for all of them, weakening rather than strengthening the style.\" Many Hispanic freestyle singers tried to downplay their Latino identity after radio programmers discriminated against records by Hispanic performers. Lisa Velez changed her name to Lisa Lisa, and became one of the first commercially successful freestyle musicians. Latin hip-hop singer Roja (one half of Rima Roja en Venus) expressed the difficulty of performing (in a male-dominated genre) a song which \"insults based on having sex with the opponent's mother, sister, aunt; or calling each other by the names of women's sexual organs. It was bizarre: they were managing to totally objectify women, and at the same time make us invisible.\" According to Roja, in her early career as a rap freestyler men tried to \"shut [her] up\". Other female hip-hop singers, such as Argentinian MC Rebeca Lane and Ecuadorian Audry Funk, concur. Argentinian Actitud María Marta, a hip-hop group formed in prison, has been called a pioneer and has inspired other female hip-hop singers. \nReggaeton dancers (to music exemplifying sexual desire) have received a negative public reception of their sexually-suggestive routines, with most public outcry about this type of dance focusing on female morality. Reggaeton singer Ivy Queen addressed concerns in her 2003 single, \"Yo Quiero Bailar\", which confronts sexual accessibility; dancing suggestively with a man does not necessarily mean that she wants to sleep with him. Recording Reggaeton Women called Ivy Queen \"the spokeswoman for females in reggaeton\" after her 2005 debut album, and she remains the only woman visible in the genre. Reggaeton has been criticized for the roles women play. Recordings often reflect lyrics and dance routines suggesting doggy style sex, exemplifying machismo behavior and hypermasculinity. Most reggaeton songs \"[circumscribe women] to dancing and fulfilling male sexual desire\", which \"eliminates almost all possibility of action and translates their presence into a prize or trophy that men exhibit, dominate, and manipulate.\" In Ivy Queen's song, \"Chika Ideal\", the singer introduces her female friend to \"the dance floor to satisfy her man's fantasies and answer (with her body) each time he wants to call her.\" In reggaeton music videos, women often act out or \"beg for sexual action\" from male musicians. In Residente's music video for \"Chulin Culin Chunfly\", women wore costumes and played police officers, bartenders, and servers. Before reggaeton became popular, Cuban singer Pedro Calvo invited preteens and middle-aged women onstage and began to \"[go] down on them\". Sexuality among young women in Cuba has been viewed as \"normative learning behavior\" descended from the Afro-Cuban Palo religion, where men and women dance closely before \"the man goes behind the women in a picaresque way\" and emulates a \"gesture of appreciation\". Cover images of reggaeton records often feature women who are \"voluptuous, provocative, and scantily clad.\"\n\nSelena's music influenced Jennifer Lopez, who played the singer in her 1997 biographical film and debuted in the Latin music market with salsa singer Marc Anthony on the 1999 single \"No Me Ames\". Lopez remained in the American pop market through the early 2000s and returned to Latin music with her Spanish-language debut, \"Como Ama Una Mujer\", in 2006. The album was a commercial success, debuting in the top ten of the \"Billboard\" 200 and joining the handful of Hispanic artists with an album in the chart's top ten. Mexican actress and singer Thalía debuted on the Latin music scene during the early 1990s. In mid-decade the singer became commercially successful, with her album \"En Éxtasis\" (1995) certified platinum. She contributed to three tracks for the 1997 soundtrack of Fox Animation Studios' \"Anastasia\". Thalía's lyrics explore \"women or men in a narcissistic, neoliberal, first-world context but do not make sense in the general context of Latin American ordinary life\" attributed to other female performers, such as the Mexican singer Paulina Rubio and the Spanish singer Belinda. Thalía and Rubio have been called \"young, blonde, and thin\", wearing \"fashionable\" clothing, whose \"dull\" lyrics assume the role of a \"seductive, sexy, young woman who wants a macho-man at heart.\" According to musicologists Jacqueline Eyring Bixler and Laurietz Seda, Thalía and Rubio's music does not address \"mature and/or working-class women\".\nShakira's major-label debut, \"Pies Descalzos\" (1995), was the singer's \"breakthrough album\" in the Latin-music market and yielded the hit single \"Estoy Aquí\". She had a Latin pop rock sound, influenced by Middle Eastern and Latin American music. Shakira continued her career with the Grammy Award for Best Latin Rock Album-nominated \"Dónde Están los Ladrones?\" (1998), and joined Gloria Estefan and her husband, Emilio, to produce her first English-language album; it yielded \"Suerte\", which brought her mainstream success. Formed in 2006 in Argentina, the Kumbia Queers have recorded cumbia and Latin pop tracks with \"ironic and witty articulations of desire\".\n\nIn Spain, Lola Flores is hailed as the queen of flamenco music and Rocío Jurado is considered \"one of the purest voices of all time\" in the country. Music executive Lynn Santiago, who represented Yolandita Monge, Lissette Melendez, and Vikki Carr during the 1980s, said in a \"Billboard\" interview that she wanted \"to represent only a few artists in order to give them individual attention.\" Latin pop musicians from Puerto Rico, such as Lucecita Benítez and Monge, had male promoters who wanted to \"bring local performers\" by \"offering a big fiesta for the people [of Puerto Rico].\" Other Latin pop musicians popular in Puerto Rico during the 1980s include Conchita Alonso, Maggy, Lunna \"Cheo\" Feliciano, Sophy Hernandez, and the Argentine duo Pimpinela. In mainstream pop, female musicians Mariah Carey, Debelah Morgan, Jessica Simpson, Celine Dion, Carole King, Tina Arena, Gloria Gaynor, Alexia, Jennifer Rush, Lara Fabian, Madonna, Laura Pausini, Beyoncé, Selena Gomez, Demi Lovato, Azealia Banks, Ariana Grande, and Toni Braxton often record Spanish-language versions of their songs.\n\nAfter winning the inaugural Festival of Latin Song in Puerto Rico in 1969, Lucecita Benítez \"single-handedly put Puerto Rico on the map.\" Her winning song, \"Génesis\", expressed \"extreme male melancholy\"; author Licia Fiol-Matta called Benitez a \"masculine female\" whose delivery \"unexpectedly delivered this affect home.\" Throughout her career, Benítez performed and recorded compositions atypical of Puerto Rican music; nonconforming to gender roles, they did not address heterosexual desire. She survived several silencing attempts by those who disliked her music. Women remain a minority in Puerto Rican music, although singers Myrta Silva, Ruth Fernandez, Ernestina Reyes, and La Calandria have achieved moderate success.\n\nThe 1989 single \"Virginidad Sacudida\" by Mexican hardcore punk band Secta Suicida Siglo explores sexual repression among women, challenged heterosexism in Latin music, and opposed refraining from premarital sex for fear of being called a prostitute. Colombian singer Andrea Echeverri's music \"underlines the hybrid nature of Latin American culture\"; called the most-important female rock en español interpreter, she \"incorporates [her music with] the past rather than refusing it or mocking it.\" Echeverri is the lead singer of Aterciopelados, the only female-led rock en español band. She pursues a feminist agenda with her music, which has made her popular in the \"most revolutionary and controversial musical genres in Latin America.\" The singer grew up encouraged by her mother to sing boleros, ballads, and rancheras. She decided to continue her education in the arts, returning to music during the 1980s. Echeverri joined Delia y Los Aminoácidos in the 1990s; influenced by punk and hardcore music, the band's name was later changed to the Aterciopelados. Because of Echeverri's interest the band's repertoire focused on women's issues, with lyrics about women's relationships with men, and performed songs exploring domestic abuse, denouncing misogyny and \"overdramatized passionate love\", and examining Latin America's ideology and history of traditional love. As her popularity grew, Echeverri became a feminist icon and released an underground recording: \"Con el Corazón en la Mano\" (1993). The album, intended as a demo, reached the top ten in Colombia and piqued the interest of BMG Music Group and MTV. The band followed with \"El Dorado\" (1995) and went to London to produce \"La Pipa de la Paz\" (1996), which was certified gold in Colombia and received Aterciopelados' first nomination for the Grammy Award for Best Latin Alternative Music Album.\nAlthough some female Latin singers have explored a range of feminist topics, including sexism, domestic abuse, and \"reclaiming women's sexuality through their music\", others (such as Julieta Venegas) have refrained from labeling themselves as feminists. Venegas said in a 2004 interview that her music has a \"feminine point of view\" and does not delve into feminism. Chilean folklorist Violeta Parra recorded songs about failed heterosexual relationships, emphasizing men's incapability to commit to a woman. Called the \"bad girl\" of Latin pop and the queen of Latin American rock music, Alejandra Guzmán has attained \"tabloid notoriety for her flesh-baring displays on stage and for a series of controversial moves and wrong turns in her personal life\" but has been credited with breaking barriers in Latin music for women. Her parents, Enrique Guzmán and Silvia Pinal, often recorded and performed music together and were considered the Mexican Sonny and Cher.\n\nIn Portuguese music, Amália Rodrigues is considered the \"best-known and most famous\" \"fadista\" by author Paul Buck; Rodrigues' lyrics were written by \"the most celebrated poets and writers of the day.\" The singer was instrumental in popularizing fado, \"attract[ing] attention around the world.\" Ana Moura has emerged in modern fado with \"transcendent singing [which] personifies [fado music]\" and lyrics reflecting \"lost love, separation, and longing.\" Fado, a traditional folk genre popular in Lisbon, was once a male enclave. Female singers such as Mariza, Mísia, Mafalda Arnauth, Dulce Pontes, Cristina Branco, Joana Amendoeira, Raquel Tavares, Yolanda Soares and Kátia Guerreiro have reinvigorated modern fado. In Portuguese folk, Teresa Salgueiro's \"rich and enchanting\" vocals have been praised. Other Portuguese female singers (Felipa Pais, Marta Dias, Sofia Varela, Anabella, Bevinda, Sara Tavares, Cesaria Evora, Maria João, Marisa Monte, and Lura) have attained moderate success in the country. Cristina Pato, Xiradela, Leilia, Ialma, and Donicelas \"represent the rediscovery of the importance of female singers in Galician traditional music.\" Ugia Pedreira, the Galician lead singer of Marful, \"mixes traditional Galician song with new jazz arrangements [and] harmonies.\"\n\nDaniela Mercury is one of the \"best-known Brazilian female singers\". During the 1950s, some female singers in Brazil were called prostitutes and risked being labeled \"promiscuous or masculine ... [or] lesbians\". According to authors Oliver Marshall, Dilwyn Jenkins and David Cleary, the country has \"a strong tradition of producing excellent female singers\". They list Elis Regina, Gal Costa, Marisa Monte, Silvia Torres, Belô Velloso, and Fernanda Porto as examples of the sizable roster of women in Brazilian music.\n\nAlthough women have been credited with reshaping Latin music and public perceptions of sexuality, gender, and feminism, the Latin music industry remains male-dominated. American musicologist Ilan Stavans credits Selena, Jenni Rivera, Jennifer Lopez, Ivy Queen, Julieta Venegas, and Ely Guerra for the visibility of women in Latin music. NPR named Maluca, Bomba Estereo, La Lupe, Gloria Trevi, Chavela Vargas, Tita Merello, as \"\"las mostras\", fierce women of Latin music.\" \"Billboard\" magazine named Selena as a \"role model to Latinas everywhere\", and \"Latina\" magazine named Gloria Estefan as \"a role model for women across the globe.\" According to \"Latina\", singers Rita Moreno, Selena, Gloria Estefan, Celia Cruz, Shakira, and Jennifer Lopez \"changed the world\" with their work, achieved \"more and [gave] more.\" With Selena, Jenni Rivera has been credited with the visibility of women in regional Mexican music with the \"very large population of Mexican American women in the United States [with whom they] could identify\". In Tejano music, Selena's popularity has helped \"open the doors\" to other female singers. Because of the singer's influence, women in Tejano music emerged \"as a significant [demographic]\" in the genre during the 1990s and major record labels began increasing their female representation. After Selena, women were \"a significant part of [the Tejano and regional Mexican music] industry.\" Her \"Dreaming of You\" (1995) album topped the \"Billboard\" 200 chart, the first Hispanic artist and the first woman to do so. At the turn of the 21st century, Thalía, Paulina Rubio, Jennifer Lopez, Shakira, and Pilar Montenegro were the most popular female Latin pop singers. Graciela Beltran, Jennifer Pena, Ana Gabriel, and Paquita la del Barrio were the most popular female singers in their respective regional-Mexican genres, but female singers remain \"rare\" in regional Mexican music. \"People en Espanol\" named singers Lucero, Chiquis Rivera, and Jennifer Lopez in its 2017 list of the top 25 most-powerful Latina women. \"Billboard\" released a list of the top 100 music executives, which included Maria Fernandez (senior vice president operations and CFO of Latin Iberia-Sony Music Entertainment) and Rocio Guerrero (global head of Latin content programming for Spotify).\n\nAlthough women in mariachi music are perceived to be widely accepted, contemporary female singers in the genre have found it an \"unwelcoming environment for females.\" According to the Duranguense group Los Horóscopos de Durango, in 21st-century regional Mexican music it is \"hard for women to actually be respected, to be taken into consideration, to be given the time to show [their] talent.\" The group has found the genre a \"struggle\" because of male dominance. In 2017, Univision broadcast the reality television competition show \"La Reina de la Canción\" (\"Queen of Song\"), in which participants with \"the best voices, compelling stories, and a desire to become a superstar\" compete to become the next star of regional Mexican music. \"Billboard\" executive director of Latin content and programming Leila Cobo wrote that the public perception of regional Mexican music is a group of men dressed as cowboys. In the 2004 and 2005 year-end charts, only one female in the genre reached the top twenty; in 2006, there were three. That year, three singles by women topped the Hot Latin Songs chart: Shakira's collaborative single with Wyclef Jean, \"Hips Don't Lie\"; Paulina Rubio's \"Ni Una Sola Palabra\", and Anais' \"Lo Que Son Las Cosas\". In 2008, there were no number-one singles by a woman on the Latin music charts. Early in 2009 Jennifer Lopez ended the drought with \"Qué Hiciste\" (number one for a week), followed by Gloria Estefan's \"No Llores\" and Fanny Lu's \"Y Si Te Digo\". In August 2009 three women (Shakira, Paulina Rubio, and Nelly Furtado) made the top ten of the Hot Latin Songs chart, a \"rare occurrence\". According to industry observers, women on the charts are \"cyclical, as every couple of years a burst of estrogen appears on the typically testosterone-dominated Latin charts.\"\nWomen finalists at the 2016 \"Billboard\" Latin Music Awards were outnumbered by men, which was described by the magazine as a \"continuing [challenge] facing female artists in Latin music.\" For 2017 International Women's Day and Women's History Month, the music streaming service Spotify curated a playlist of women in Latin music. The playlist included music from Selena, Celia Cruz, and Natalia Lafourcade. An April 2016 \"Billboard\" report noted the absence of women from the magazine's music charts. The report found that the last female soloist topped the US Hot Latin Songs chart four years earlier: Shakira, with Maná (a male rock en español group), singing \"Mi Verdad\". In 2012 seven women had number-ones on the Top Latin Albums chart, compared with 33 men. \"Billboard\" executive Leila Cobo found that three of the seven women were veterans (Gloria Trevi, Thalía, and Ednita Nazario), and another three were deceased (Selena, Jenni Rivera, and Natalie Cole. Leslie Grace was the youngest female singer to reach number one on the Latin Airplay chart when she was 17 years old, and Alexandra Lioutikoff was the first woman executive vice-president at Universal Music Publishing Group's Latin division. Asked why the visibility of women in Latin music has declined, Chiquis Rivera suggested that radio programmers are to blame for their \"\"machista\" culture.\" According to Lioutikoff, women (unlike their male counterparts) \"rarely collaborate\". In its report, \"Billboard\" compiled a list of the top five women with the most number-ones on the Hot Latin Songs; Gloria Estefan led the list with 15, Shakira had 10, Selena seven, Ana Gabriel six, and Paulina Rubio five. The magazine found women \"underrepresented on the Latin-music-focused \"Billboard\" charts\", with Rubio the last female number-one with \"Me Gustas Todo\" on February 11, 2012. A discrepancy existed between the Top Latin Albums and the \"Billboard\" 200 charts; seven women topped the Latin Albums chart, compared to 21 on the \"Billboard\" 200.\n\nWomen remain a minority in Puerto Rican music. According to Licia Fiol-Matta, the music industry has a \"prejudiced practice of limiting the number of women recording artists\" and women singers \"did not sell records since women did not buy records.\" In July 2017, Alejandra Guzmán and Gloria Trevi were the first female collaboration in the 24-year history of the Top Latin Albums chart to debut atop the chart. In 2016, Mexican pop singer Sofia Reyes was the first female lead singer with a number-one single in five years. Her collaboration with Prince Royce on \"Solo Yo\" was the first number-one single on the Latin Pop Songs chart by a woman since Jennifer Lopez' \"Ven A Bailar\" (2011) with Pitbull. Eight women have topped the Latin Pop Songs chart as featured acts, duos or groups with female leads: \"Solo Yo\" (Sofia Reyes with Prince Royce, April 23, 2016); \"Mi Verdad\" (Maná, featuring Shakira, April 4, 2015); \"Corre!\" (Jesse & Joy, March 31, 2012); \"Dutty Love\" (Don Omar with Natti Natasha, March 24, 2012), \"Fuiste Tu\" (Ricardo Arjona with Gaby Moreno, March 10, 2012); \"Give Me Everything\" (Pitbull with Ne-Yo, Afrojack and Nayer, July 23, 2011), and \"Ven A Bailar\" (Jennifer Lopez with Pitbull, June 18, 2011). Amaya Mendizabal of \"Billboard\" called the decline of women on the Latin music charts \"an ongoing trend.\" In 2015, 22 weeks passed without a female-led single on the 50-position Hot Latin Songs chart. According to Mendizabal, the absence of women on the Latin music charts is \"partly attributed to the steady popularity of reggaeton and regional Mexican music, which is often led by male acts.\" Mendizabal wrote that \"traditional pop songs\" rarely top the Hot Latin Songs chart; four pop songs did so in the previous three years, most by men. Sofia Reyes has expressed concern about the lack of women performers at Latin-music awards shows, telling Jeff Benjamin of Fuse TV that 90 percent of awards-show performers are men.\n\nIn July 2017, Spanish writer Daniela Bose noted the absence of women in Spanish music charts in comparison with those of France and Italy; culturally similar to Spain, women were more successful in the latter countries. Bose analyzed the Spanish Albums and Singles Charts, finding that the only Spanish singers who placed in the top 50 were Malú, Vanesa Martin, Sweet California, India Martinez, and the Spanish folk music singers Mónica Naranjo and Isabel Pantoja. When Bose expanded her search to the next 50 positions, she found only non-Spanish singers. She concluded that listeners had replaced Spanish and Latin pop music with reggaeton and trap music, genres performed by men with lyrics belittling women \"as meat\". Bose found a subtext in the songs encouraging female infidelity for sexual reasons, alluding to a non-committed relationship. According to Bose, music \"is not one of those 'secure' professions [for those who] seek stability\"; she found women absent from prominent positions held by men, such as heading a record label, producing concerts, and audio engineering; in these fields, with higher pay and power, women lack \"decision-making process[es] that set the path for [the Latin music] industry.\" She ended her report by urging the music industry to avoid gender imbalances in their markets: \"What dazzles is the beauty of the final work, regardless of who creates it.\"\n\n\n"}
