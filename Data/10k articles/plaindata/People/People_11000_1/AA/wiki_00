His best known book, \"I Can Jump Puddles\" (1955) is the first of a three-part autobiography. The other two books are \"This is the Grass\" (1962) and \"In Mine Own Heart\" (1963).\n\nMarshall was born in Noorat, Victoria. At six years old he contracted polio, which left him with a physical disability that grew worse as he grew older. From an early age, he resolved to be a writer, and in \"I Can Jump Puddles\" he demonstrated an almost total recall of his childhood in Noorat. The characters and places of his book are thinly disguised from real life: \"Mount Turalla\" is Mount Noorat, \"Lake Turalla\" is Lake Keilambete, the \"Curruthers\" are the \"Blacks\", Mrs. Conlon is Mary Conlon of Dixie, Terang, and his best friend, \"Joe\" from the books, is Leo Carmody.\nAustralian poet and contemporary, Hal Porter wrote in 1965 that Marshall was:\n\"... the warmest and most centralized human being ... To walk with ease and nonchalance the straight, straight line between appearing tragic and appearing willfully brave is a feat so complex I should not like to have to rake in the dark for the super-bravery to accomplish it.\"\n\nMarshall wrote numerous short stories, mainly set in the bush. He also wrote newspaper columns and magazine articles. He traveled widely in Australia and overseas. He also collected and published Indigenous Australian stories and legends.\n\nHis literary friends and associates included John Morrison and Clem Christesen.\n\nHe married Olive Dulcie Dixon in May 1941 and they had 2 daughters, Katherine and Jennifer. The couple divorced in 1957.\n\nMarshall died in 1984. His remains are interred at Nillumbik (Diamond Creek) Cemetery, Victoria, Australia.\n\nIn 1981 the Australian Broadcasting Corporation produced a nine-part mini-series of Marshall's autobiographical stories. The actor, Adam Garnett, won the 1982 Logie Awards for \"Best Performance by a Juvenile\", for his role as Alan Marshall in the series.\n\nIn 1985 the Shire of Eltham, where Marshall had lived for many years, established the annual Alan Marshall Short Story Competition for emergent writers.\nIn 1937, he completed his first novel, \"How Beautiful Are Thy Feet\", which remained unpublished until 1949.\n\nMarshall was made a Member of the Order of Australia in the 1981 Australia Day Honours. He died in Melbourne.\n\nThere is a bronze bust of him and a plaque in the Sandringham Municipal Library, Melbourne.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "31663216", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=31663216", "title": "Apostles", "text": "Apostles\n\nIn Christian theology and ecclesiology, the apostles (), particularly the Twelve Apostles (also known as the Twelve Disciples or simply the Twelve), were the primary disciples of Jesus, the central figure in Christianity. During the life and ministry of Jesus in the 1st century AD, the apostles were his closest followers and became the primary teachers of the gospel message of Jesus. The word \"disciple\" is sometimes used interchangeably with \"apostle\"; for instance, the Gospel of John makes no distinction between the two terms.\n\nIn modern usage, prominent missionaries are often called apostles, a practice which stems from the Latin equivalent of \"apostle\", i.e. \"\", the source of the English word \"missionary\". For example, Saint Patrick (AD 373–463) was the \"Apostle of Ireland\", Saint Boniface (680–755) was the \"Apostle to the Germans\", Saint José de Anchieta (1534–1597) was the \"Apostle of Brazil\" and Saint Peter of Betancur (1626–1667) was the \"Apostle of Guatemala\".\n\nWhile Christian tradition often refers to the apostles as being twelve in number, different gospel writers give different names for the same individual, and apostles mentioned in one gospel are not mentioned in others. The commissioning of the Twelve Apostles during the ministry of Jesus is recorded in the Synoptic Gospels. After his resurrection, Jesus sent eleven of them (minus Judas Iscariot, who by then had died) by the Great Commission to spread his teachings to all nations. This event is commonly called the Dispersion of the Apostles. There is also an Eastern Christian tradition derived from the Gospel of Luke of there having been as many as 70 apostles during the time of Jesus' ministry. Prominent figures in early Christianity, notably Paul, were often called apostles, even though their ministry or mission came after the life of Jesus.\n\nThe period of early Christianity during the lifetimes of the apostles is called the Apostolic Age. During the 1st century AD, the apostles established churches throughout the territories of the Roman Empire and, according to tradition, through the Middle East, Africa, and India.\n\nThe word \"apostle\" comes from the Greek word (\"apóstolos\"), formed from the prefix (\"apó-\", \"from\") and root (\"stéllō\", \"I send\", \"I depart\") and originally meaning \"messenger, envoy\". It has, however, a stronger sense than the word messenger, and is closer to a \"delegate\". The \"Greek-English Lexicon of the New Testament\" argues that its Christian use translated a Jewish position known in Hebrew as the \"sheliach\" (). This ecclesiastical meaning of the word was later translated into Latin as \"\", the source of the English \"missionary\".\n\nIn the New Testament, the majority of the apostles have Hebrew names, although some have Greek names. Many Jews at the time had Latin or Greek names as well as Hebrew names.\n\nLater in the Gospel narratives the twelve apostles are described as having been commissioned to preach the Gospel to \"all the nations\", regardless of whether Jew or Gentile. Paul emphasized the important role of the apostles in the church of God when he said that the household of God is \"built upon the foundation of apostles and prophets, Christ Jesus himself being the cornerstone\".\nAlthough not one of the apostles commissioned during the life of Jesus, Paul, a Jew named Saul of Tarsus, claimed a special commission from the risen Jesus and is considered \"the apostle of the Gentiles\", for his missions to spread the gospel message after his conversion. In his writings, the epistles to Christian churches throughout the Levant, Paul did not restrict the term \"apostle\" to the Twelve, and often refers to his mentor Barnabas as an apostle. The restricted usage appears in the Revelation to John.\n\nBy the 2nd century AD, association with the apostles was esteemed as an evidence of authority. Churches which are believed to have been founded by one of the apostles are known as apostolic sees. Paul's epistles were accepted as scripture, and two of the four canonical gospels were associated with apostles, as were other New Testament works. Various Christian texts, such as the \"Didache\" and the \"Apostolic Constitutions\", were attributed to the apostles. Bishops traced their lines of succession back to individual apostles, who were said to have dispersed from Jerusalem and established churches across great territories. Christian bishops have traditionally claimed authority deriving, by apostolic succession, from the Twelve. Early Church Fathers who came to be associated with apostles, such as Pope Clement I with St. Peter, are referred to as the Apostolic Fathers. The Apostles' Creed, popular in the West, was said to have been composed by the apostles themselves.\n\nThe three Synoptic Gospels record the circumstances in which some of the disciples were recruited, Matthew only describing the recruitment of Simon, Andrew, James, and John. All three Synoptic Gospels state that these four were recruited fairly soon after Jesus returned from being tempted by the devil.\n\nDespite Jesus only briefly requesting that they join him, they are all described as immediately consenting, and abandoning their nets to do so. Traditionally the immediacy of their consent was viewed as an example of divine power, although this statement is not made in the text itself. The alternative and much more ordinary solution is that Jesus was simply friends with the individuals beforehand, as implied by the Gospel of John, which states that Peter (Simon) and Andrew were disciples of John the Baptist, and started following Jesus as soon as Jesus had been baptized.\n\nAlbright and Mann extrapolate from Simon's and Andrew's abandonment of their nets that Matthew is emphasizing the importance of renunciation by converting to Christianity, since fishing was profitable, although required large start-up costs, and abandoning everything would have been an important sacrifice. Regardless, Simon and Andrew's abandonment of what were effectively their most important worldly possessions was taken as a model by later Christian ascetics.\nMatthew describes Jesus meeting James and John, also fishermen and brothers, very shortly after recruiting Simon and Andrew. Matthew and Mark identify James and John as sons of Zebedee. Luke adds to Matthew and Mark that James and John worked as a team with Simon and Andrew. Matthew states that at the time of the encounter, James and John were repairing their nets, but readily joined Jesus without hesitation.\n\nThis parallels the accounts of Mark and Luke, but Matthew implies that the men have also abandoned their father (since he is present in the ship they abandon behind them), and Carter feels this should be interpreted to mean that Matthew's view of Jesus is one of a figure rejecting the traditional patriarchal structure of society, where the father had command over his children; most scholars, however, just interpret it to mean that Matthew intended these two to be seen as even more devoted than the other pair.\n\nThe Synoptic Gospels go on to describe that much later, after Jesus had later begun his ministry, he noticed, while teaching, a tax collector in his booth. The tax collector, called Matthew in , Levi in and , is asked by Jesus to become one of his disciples. Matthew/Levi is stated to have accepted and then invited Jesus for a meal with his friends. Tax collectors were seen as villains in Jewish society, and the Pharisees are described as asking Jesus why he is having a meal with such disreputable people. The reply Jesus gives to this is now well known: \"it is not the healthy who need a doctor, but the sick. I have not come to call the righteous, but sinners\".\n\nAfter Judas Iscariot betrayed Christ and then in guilt committed suicide before Christ's resurrection (in one Gospel account), the apostles numbered eleven. When Jesus had been taken up from them, in preparation for the coming of the Holy Spirit that he had promised them, Peter advised the brethren:\nSo, between the ascension of Christ and the day of Pentecost, the remaining apostles elected a twelfth apostle by casting lots, a traditional Israelite way to determine the will of God (see ). The lot fell upon Matthias.\n\nPaul the Apostle in his First Epistle to the Corinthians, appears to give the first historical reference to the twelve apostles:\nIn his writings, Paul the Apostle, although not one of the original twelve, described himself as an \"apostle\", one \"born out of due time\" (e.g., , 1 Corinthians 15:8 and other letters). He was called by the resurrected Jesus himself during his Road to Damascus vision and given the name \"Paul\". With Barnabas, he was allotted the role of apostle in the church. He referred to himself as the \"apostle of the Gentiles.\"\n\nAs the \"Catholic Encyclopedia\" states, \"It is at once evident that in a Christian sense, everyone who had received a mission from God, or Christ, to man could be called 'Apostle'\"; thus extending the original sense beyond the twelve.\n\nSince Paul claimed to have received the gospel through a revelation of Jesus Christ after the latter's death and resurrection (rather than before like the twelve), he was often obliged to defend his apostolic authority () and proclaim that he had seen and was anointed by Jesus while on the road to Damascus.\n\nJames, Peter and John in Jerusalem accepted his calling to the apostleship from the Lord to the Gentiles (specifically those not circumcised) as of equal authority as Peter's to the Jews (specifically those circumcised) according to Paul. \"James, Peter and John, those reputed to be pillars ... agreed that we [Paul and Barnabas] should go to the Gentiles, and they to the Jews.\"\n\nPaul, despite his divine calling as an apostle, considered himself perhaps inferior to the other apostles because he had originally persecuted Christ's followers. In addition, despite the Little Commission of Matthew 10, the twelve did not limit their mission to solely Jews as Cornelius the Centurion is widely considered the first Gentile convert and he was converted by Peter, and the Great Commission of the Resurrected Jesus is specifically to \"all nations\".\n\nOf the twelve Apostles to hold the title after Matthias' selection, Christian tradition has generally passed down that all but one were martyred, with John surviving into old age. Only the death of James, son of Zebedee is described in the New Testament.\n\nAccording to the 18th-century historian Edward Gibbon, early Christians (second half of the second century and first half of the third century) believed that only Peter, Paul, and James, son of Zebedee, were martyred. The remainder or even all of the claims of martyred apostles do not rely upon historical or biblical evidence.\n\nThe relics of the Apostles are claimed by various Churches, many in Italy.\n\nEach of the four listings of apostles in the New Testament (, , , and ) indicate that all the apostles were men. The canonical gospels and the book of Acts give varying names of the twelve apostles. The list in the Gospel of Luke differs from Matthew and Mark at two points. It lists \"Judas the son of James\" instead of \"Thaddeus\". (For more information, see Jude the Apostle.) Unlike the Synoptic Gospels, the Gospel of John does not offer a formal list of apostles. Although it refers to \"the Twelve\" (), the gospel does not present any elaboration of who these twelve actually were, and the author of the Gospel of John does not mention them all by name. There is also no separation of the terms \"apostles\" and \"disciples\" in John.\n\nIn Luke (10:38–42), Mary, sister of Lazarus, is contrasted with her sister Martha, who was \"cumbered about many things\" while Jesus was their guest, while Mary had chosen \"the better part,\" that of listening to the master's discourse. John names her as the \"one who had anointed the Lord with perfumed oil and dried his feet with her hair\" (11:2). In Luke, an unidentified \"sinner\" in the house of a Pharisee anoints Jesus' feet. In Medieval Catholic folklore, Mary, the sister of Lazarus, was seen as the same as Mary Magdalene.\n\nLuke refers to a number of people accompanying Jesus and the twelve. From among them he names three women: \"Mary, called Magdalene, ... and Joanna the wife of Herod's steward Chuza, and Susanna, and many others, who provided for them out of their resources\" (Luke 8:2-3). Mary Magdalene and Joanna are among the women who went to prepare Jesus' body in Luke's account of the resurrection, and who later told the apostles and other disciples about the empty tomb and words of the \"two men in dazzling clothes\". Mary Magdalene is the most well-known of the disciples outside of the Twelve. More is written in the gospels about her than the other female followers. There is also a large body of lore and literature covering her.\n\nOther gospel writers differ as to which women witness the crucifixion and witness to the resurrection. Mark includes Mary, the mother of James and Salome (not to be confused with Salomé the daughter of Herodias) at the crucifixion and Salome at the tomb. John includes Mary the wife of Clopas at the crucifixion.\n\nThe \"seventy disciples\" or \"seventy-two disciples\" (known in the Eastern Christian traditions as the \"Seventy Apostles\") were early emissaries of Jesus mentioned in the Gospel of Luke . According to Luke, the only gospel in which they appear, Jesus appointed them and sent them out in pairs on a specific mission which is detailed in the text.\n\nIn Western Christianity, they are usually referred to as disciples, whereas in Eastern Christianity they are usually referred to as Apostles. Using the original Greek words, both titles are descriptive, as an \"apostle\" is one sent on a mission (the Greek uses the verb form: \"apesteilen\") whereas a \"disciple\" is a student, but the two traditions differ on the scope of the words \"apostle\" and \"disciple\".\n\nThe Gospel of Matthew is anonymous: the author is not named within the text, and the superscription \"according to Matthew\" was added some time in the 2nd century. The tradition that the author was Matthew the Apostle begins with Papias of Hierapolis (c. AD 100–140), an early bishop and Apostolic Father, who is cited by the Church historian Eusebius (AD 260–340), as follows: \"Matthew collected the oracles [\"logia\": sayings of or about Jesus] in the Hebrew language [\"Hebraïdi dialektōi\"], and each one interpreted [\"hērmēneusen—\"perhaps 'translated'] them as best he could.\"\n\nAlthough the Gospel of John is anonymous, Christian tradition historically has attributed it to John the Apostle, son of Zebedee and one of Jesus' Twelve Apostles. The gospel is so closely related in style and content to the three surviving Johannine epistles that commentators treat the four books, along with the Book of Revelation, as a single corpus of Johannine literature, albeit not necessarily written by the same author.\n\nThe Gospel of Mark was written anonymously. Early Christian tradition, first attested by Papias of Hierapolis, ascribes it to John Mark, a companion and interpreter of the apostle Peter. Hence its author is often called Mark, even though most modern scholars are doubtful of the Markan tradition and instead regard the author as unknown. It was probably written c. AD 66–70, during Nero's persecution of the Christians in Rome or the Jewish revolt, as suggested by internal references to war in Judea and to persecution. The author used a variety of pre-existing sources, such as conflict stories (Mark 2:1–3:6), apocalyptic discourse (4:1–35), and collections of sayings (although not the Gospel of Thomas and probably not the Q source).\n\nAccording to Church tradition, Luke the Evangelist, the companion of Paul, is believed to have authored the Gospel of Luke, though anonymously written and lacking an author's name; but while this view is still occasionally put forward the scholarly consensus emphasises the many contradictions between Acts and the authentic Pauline letters. The most probable date for its composition is around 80–110 AD, and there is evidence that it was still being revised well into the 2nd century.\n\n"}

They are venerated as saints in the Oriental Orthodox Church and their feast day is 10 December.\n\nBehnam and Sarah were born in the 4th-century in Adiabene, and were the children of Sinharib, an Assyrian king. Whilst hunting on Mount Alfaf with forty slaves, Behnam became separated from his entourage and was forced to spend the night on the mountain. He received a dream in which an angel instructed him to seek Saint Matthew, who lived on the mountain, as the saint could heal his sister Sarah, who was afflicted with leprosy. Behnam met with his entourage the next day, and they discovered Saint Matthew in a cave and requested he join them on their return to the city, to which he agreed.\n\nBehnam and his entourage returned to the city ahead of Saint Matthew and told his mother of his dream and the saint. His mother allowed Behnam and Sarah to return to the saint in secret, and he healed Sarah of her leprosy, after which Behnam, Sarah, and the forty slaves were baptised and Saint Matthew returned to Mount Alfaf. Sinharib discovered Behnam and Sarah's conversion and demanded they abandon Christianity. Stalwart in their faith, Behnam, Sarah, and the forty slaves, fled to Mount Alfaf, but were slain by soldiers sent by Sinharib.\n\nFollowing his children's death, Sinharib was afflicted with madness. Behnam spoke to his mother in a dream and instructed her to seek Saint Matthew, as he could heal the king. The queen took the king to the place of Behnam and Sarah's death, where he met with Saint Matthew and was cured. Sinharib and his wife returned to Assur with the saint and were baptised. The king had a monument to the martyrs built at the place of their martyrdom, and, at the request of Saint Matthew, constructed a monastery on Mount Alfaf, which later became known as the Monastery of St. Matthew. Sinharib had the martyrs buried at the monastery atop Mount Alfaf. In the 6th century, a Persian merchant constructed a shrine to the martyrs alongside Sinharib's monument, and would later develop into the Monastery of Saints Behnam and Sarah.\n\n"}

{"id": "85731", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=85731", "title": "Catherine of Alexandria", "text": "Catherine of Alexandria\n\nSaint Catherine of Alexandria, or Saint Catharine of Alexandria, also known as Saint Catherine of the Wheel and The Great Martyr Saint Catherine (; \"Holy Catherine the Great Martyr\"; ), is, according to tradition, a Christian saint and virgin, who was martyred in the early 4th century at the hands of the pagan emperor Maxentius. According to her hagiography, she was both a princess and a noted scholar, who became a Christian around the age of 14, converted hundreds of people to Christianity, and was martyred around the age of 18. More than 1,100 years following her martyrdom, Saint Joan of Arc identified Catherine as one of the Saints who appeared to her and counselled her.\n\nThe Eastern Orthodox Church venerates her as a Great Martyr and celebrates her feast day on 24 or 25 November (depending on the regional tradition). In Catholicism she is traditionally revered as one of the Fourteen Holy Helpers. In 1969 the Roman Catholic Church removed her feast day from the General Roman Calendar; however, she continued to be commemorated in the Roman Martyrology on 25 November. In 2002, her feast was restored to the General Roman Calendar as an optional memorial.\n\nSome modern scholars consider that the legend of Catherine was probably based on the life and murder of the Greek philosopher Hypatia, with reversed roles of Christians and pagans.\n\nAccording to the traditional narrative, Catherine was the daughter of Constus, the governor of Egyptian Alexandria during the reign of the emperor Maximian (286–305). From a young age she devoted herself to study. A vision of the Madonna and Child persuaded her to become a Christian. When the persecutions began under Maxentius, she went to the emperor and rebuked him for his cruelty. The emperor summoned 50 of the best pagan philosophers and orators to dispute with her, hoping that they would refute her pro-Christian arguments, but Catherine won the debate. Several of her adversaries, conquered by her eloquence, declared themselves Christians and were at once put to death.\n\nCatherine was then scourged and imprisoned. She was scourged so cruelly and for so long, that her whole body was covered with wounds, from which the blood flowed in streams. The spectators wept with pity; but Catherine, strengthened by God, stood with her eyes raised to heaven, without giving a sign of suffering or fear. He ordered her to be imprisoned without food, so she would starve to death. During the confinement, angels tended her wounds with salve. Catherine was fed daily by a dove from Heaven and Christ also visited her, encouraging her to fight bravely, and promised her the crown of everlasting glory. \n\nDuring her imprisonment, over 200 people came to see her, including Maxentius' wife, Valeria Maximilla; all converted to Christianity and were subsequently martyred. Twelve days later, when the dungeon was opened, a bright light and fragrant perfume filled it, and Catherine came forth even more radiant and beautiful. \n\nUpon the failure of Maxentius to make Catherine yield by way of torture, he tried to win the beautiful and wise princess over by proposing marriage. The saint refused, declaring that her spouse was Jesus Christ, to whom she had consecrated her virginity. \n\nThe furious emperor condemned Catherine to death on a spiked breaking wheel, but, at her touch, it shattered. Maxentius ordered her to be beheaded. Catherine herself ordered the execution to commence. A milk-like substance rather than blood flowed from her neck. \n\nAngels transported her body to the highest mountain (now called Mt. Saint Catherine) next to Mount Sinai, where God gave His Law. In 850, her incorrupt body was discovered by monks from the Sinai Monastery. The monks found on the surface of the granite on which her body lay, an impression of the form of her body. Her hair still growing, and a constant stream of the most heavenly fragranced healing oil issuing from her body. This oil produced countless miracles. \n\nIn the 6th century, the Eastern Emperor Justinian had established what is now Saint Catherine's Monastery in Egypt (which is in fact dedicated to the Transfiguration of Christ). Her relics include her left hand, often warm to the touch and her head. Her incorrupt body is not publicly displayed. Countless people make the pilgrimage to the Monastery to receive miracle healing from Saint Catherine.\n\nDonald Attwater dismisses what he calls the \"legend\" of Saint Catherine, arguing for a lack of any \"positive evidence that she ever existed outside the mind of some Greek writer who first composed what he intended to be simply an edifying romance.\" Harold Davis writes that \"assiduous research has failed to identify Catherine with any historical personage\" and has theorized that Catherine was an invention inspired to provide a counterpart to the story of the slightly later pagan philosopher Hypatia of Alexandria (c. 350–370 – March 415 CE).\n\nModern scholarship supports Davis’ assumption that the legend of Catherine of Alexandria was probably based on the life and murder of Hypatia, with the roles of Christians and pagans reversed. \n\nHypatia was a Greek mathematician, astronomer, and philosopher, who was brutally murdered by a Christian mob after being accused of exacerbating a conflict between two prominent figures in Alexandria, the governor, Orestes, and the bishop, Cyril of Alexandria.\n\nSometimes cited as a possible inspiration of Saint Catherine, the writer Eusebius wrote, around the year 320, that the Emperor had ordered a young Christian woman to come to his palace to become his mistress, and when she refused, he had her punished, by having her banished and her estates confiscated. Although Eusebius did not name the woman, she had been identified with Dorothea of Alexandria.\n\nThe earliest surviving account of Saint Catherine's life comes around 600 years after the traditional date of her martyrdom, in the \"menologium\" a document compiled for Emperor Basil II (976), although the rediscovery of her relics at Saint Catherine's Monastery at the foot of Mount Sinai was about 800, and presumably implies an existing cult at that date (the common name of the monastery developed after the discovery). The monastery was built by order of Emperor Justinian I (reigned 527–565), enclosing the Chapel of the Burning Bush ordered to be built by Helena, the mother of Constantine I, at the site where Moses is supposed to have seen the burning bush; the living bush on the grounds is purportedly the original. It is also referred to as \"Saint Helen's Chapel\". The main church was built between 548 and 565, and the monastery became a major pilgrimage site for devotees of Catherine and the other relics and sacred sites there. Saint Catherine's Monastery survives, and is a famous repository of early Christian art, architecture and illuminated manuscripts that remains open to tourists and visiting scholars. The site is sacred to Christianity, Islam, and Judaism.\n\nIn her book \"The Cult of St Katherine of Alexandria in Early Medieval Europe\", Christine Walsh discusses \"the historical Katherine\": \"As we have seen, the cult of St Katherine of Alexandria probably originated in oral traditions from the 4th-century Diocletianic Persecutions of Christians in Alexandria. There is no evidence that Katherine herself was a historical figure and she may well have been a composite drawn from memories of women persecuted for their faith. Many aspects of her \"Passio\" are clearly legendary and conform to well-known hagiographical topoi.\"\n\nRufinus states that her first name was Dorothea (), and that at her christening she acquired the name Aikaterina (), a name that signifies her pure, clean and uncontaminated nature (from Greek 'ever clean').\n\nSaint Catherine was one of the most important saints in the religious culture of the late Middle Ages, and arguably considered the most important of the virgin martyrs, a group including Saint Agnes, Margaret of Antioch, Saint Barbara, Saint Lucy, Valerie of Limoges and many others. Her power as an intercessor was renowned and firmly established in most versions of her hagiography, in which she specifically entreats Christ at the moment of her death to answer the prayers of those who remember her martyrdom and invoke her name.\n\nThe development of her medieval cult was spurred by the reported rediscovery of her body around the year 800 at Mount Sinai, with hair still growing and a constant stream of healing oil issuing from her body. There are several pilgrimage narratives that chronicle the journey to Mount Sinai, most notably those of John Mandeville and Friar Felix Fabri. However, the monastery at Mount Sinai was the best-known site of Catherine pilgrimage, but was also the most difficult to reach. The most prominent Western shrine was the monastery in Rouen that claimed to house Catherine's fingers. It was not alone in the west, however, accompanied by many, scattered shrines and altars dedicated to Catherine, which existed throughout France and England. Some were better known sites, such as Canterbury and Westminster, which claimed a phial of her oil, brought back from Mount Sinai by Edward the Confessor. Other shrines, such as St. Catherine's Hill, Hampshire were the focus of generally local pilgrimage, many of which are only identified by brief mentions in various texts, rather than by physical evidence.\n\nSt. Catharine's College, Cambridge was founded on St Catharine’s Day (25 November) 1473 by Robert Woodlark (the then-provost of King's College Cambridge) who sought to create a small community of scholars who would study exclusively theology and philosophy. Wodelarke may have chosen the name in homage to Catherine of Valois, mother of Henry VI of England, although it is more likely that it was named as part of the Renaissance cult of Saint Catharine, who was a patron saint of learning. At any rate, the college was ready for habitation and formally founded on Saint Catharine’s Day, 1473.\n\nSaint Catherine also had a large female following, whose devotion was less likely to be expressed through pilgrimage. The importance of the virgin martyrs as the focus of devotion and models for proper feminine behavior increased during the Late Middle Ages. Among these, St. Catherine in particular was used as an exemplar for women, a status which at times superseded her intercessory role. Both Christine de Pizan and Geoffrey de la Tour Landry point to Catherine as a paragon for young women, emphasizing her model of virginity and \"wifely chastity.\" From the early 14th century the Mystic marriage of Saint Catherine first appears in hagiographical literature and, soon after, in art. In the Western church, the popularity of her cult began to reduce in the 18th century.\n\nHer principal symbol is the spiked wheel, which has become known as the Catherine wheel, and her feast day is celebrated on 25 November by most Christian churches. However, the Russian Orthodox Church celebrates it on 24 November (as do also the Polish, Serbian and Bulgarian Orthodox Churches). The exact origin of this tradition is not known. In 11th-century Kyivan-Rus, the feast day was celebrated on 25 November. Saint Dimitry of Rostov in his \"Kniga zhyttia sviatykh\" (\"Book of the Lives of the Saints\"), T.1 (1689) places the date of celebration on 24 November. A story that Empress Catherine the Great did not wish to share her patronal feast with the Leavetaking of the feast of the Presentation of the Theotokos and hence changed the date is not supported by historical evidence. One of the first Roman Catholic churches to be built in Russia, the Catholic Church of St. Catherine, was named after Catherine of Alexandria because she was Catherine the Great's patron. A footnote to the entry for 25th November in \"The Synaxarion\" compiled by Hieromonk Makarios of Simonos Petra states: \"Until the 16th century, the memory of St Catherine was observed on 24 Nov. According to a note by Bartholomew of Koutloumousiou inserted in the \"Menaion\", the Fathers of Sinai transferred the date to 25 Nov. in order that the feast might be kept with greater solemnity.\"\n\nThe 1908 \"Catholic Encyclopedia\" describes her historical importance:\n\nIn many places her feast was celebrated with the utmost solemnity, servile work being suppressed and the devotions attended by great numbers of people. In several dioceses of France it was observed as a Holy Day of Obligation up to the beginning of the 17th century, the splendour of its ceremonial eclipsing that of the feasts of some of the Apostles. Numberless chapels were placed under her patronage and her statue was found in nearly all churches, representing her according to medieval iconography with a wheel, her instrument of torture.\n\nIn France, unwed women who have attained the age of 25 wear richly decorated bonnets on the day of her feast. This custom gave rise to the French idiom \"\" ('don St. Catherine's bonnet'), to describe an unmarried woman between the ages of 25 and 30.\n\nIn memory of her sacrifice in some homes, Egyptian and other Middle Eastern foods are offered for her feast, such as hummus or tabbouleh salads. Favorites also are melons cut into circles with sherbet \"hubs,\" or cookies shaped as spiked wheels with icing. \n\nMeanwhile, owing to several circumstances in his life, Saint Nicholas of Myra was considered the patron of young bachelors and students, and Saint Catherine became the patroness of young maidens and female students. Looked upon as the holiest and most illustrious of the virgins of Christ after the Blessed Virgin Mary, it was natural that she, of all others, should be worthy to watch over the virgins of the cloister and the young women of the world. The spiked wheel having become emblematic of the saint, wheelwrights and mechanics placed themselves under her patronage. Finally, as according to tradition, she not only remained a virgin by governing her passions and conquered her executioners by wearying their patience, but triumphed in science by closing the mouths of sophists, her intercession was implored by theologians, apologists, pulpit orators, and philosophers. Before studying, writing, or preaching, they besought her to illumine their minds, guide their pens, and impart eloquence to their words. This devotion to Saint Catherine which assumed such vast proportions in Europe after the Crusades, received additional éclat in France in the beginning of the 15th century, when it was rumoured that she had spoken to Joan of Arc and, together with Saint Margaret, had been divinely appointed Joan's adviser.\nDevotion to Saint Catherine remains strong amongst Eastern Catholics and Eastern Orthodox Christians. With the relative ease of travel in the modern age, pilgrimages to Saint Catherine's Monastery at Mount Sinai have increased. Pilgrims to her monastery on Mt Sinai are given a ring, which has been placed on the relics of the saint as an \"evlogia\" (blessing) in remembrance of their visit.\n\nThe pyrotechnic Catherine wheel, from which sparks fly off in all directions, took its name from the saint's wheel of martyrdom.\n\nCountless images of Saint Catherine are depicted in art, especially in the late Middle Ages, which is also the time that the account of Saint Catherine's Mystical Marriage makes its first literary appearance. She can usually be easily recognised as she is richly dressed and crowned, as befits her rank as a princess, and often holds or stands next to a segment of her wheel as an attribute. She also often carries either a martyr's palm or the sword with which she was actually executed. She often has long unbound blonde or reddish hair (unbound as she is unmarried). The vision of Saint Catherine of Alexandria usually shows the Infant Christ, held by the Virgin, placing a ring (one of her attributes) on her finger, following some literary accounts, although in the version in the \"Golden Legend\" he appears to be adult, and the marriage takes place among a great crowd of angels and \"all the celestial court\", and these may also be shown.\n\nShe is very frequently shown attending on the Virgin and Child, and is usually prominent in scenes of the \"Master of the Virgo inter Virgines\", showing a group of virgin saints surrounding the Virgin and Child. Notable later paintings of Catherine include single figures by Raphael (National Gallery) and \nCaravaggio (Madrid), (Thyssen-Bornemisza Museum).\n\n\n\n\n\n[[Category:282 births]]\n[[Category:305 deaths]]\n[[Category:3rd-century Romans]]\n[[Category:4th-century Romans]]\n[[Category:3rd-century Roman women]]\n[[Category:4th-century Roman women]]\n[[Category:4th-century Christian martyrs]]\n[[Category:4th-century Christian saints]]\n[[Category:Ancient Alexandrians]]\n[[Category:Ancient Roman women]]\n[[Category:Converts to Christianity from pagan religions]]\n[[Category:Coptic Christians]]\n[[Category:Coptic Orthodox saints]]\n[[Category:Copts]]\n[[Category:Egyptian saints]]\n[[Category:Egyptian Christian saints]]\n[[Category:Fourteen Holy Helpers]]\n[[Category:Joan of Arc]]\n[[Category:Late Ancient Christian female saints]]\n[[Category:Marian visionaries]]\n[[Category:People whose existence is disputed]]\n[[Category:Saint Catherine's Monastery]]\n[[Category:Saints from Roman Egypt]]\n[[Category:Hypatia]]"}

The son of Nato-West-Sitsi (Medicine Fire) and nephew of Big Chief Crowfoot. Deerfoot-Bad Meat followed the Blackfoot tradition at the time of having several wives and several children; he died on Feb 24, 1897 in Calgary.\n\nBy 1880, Deerfoot-Bad Meat had become an exceptional long-distance runner working as a messenger for the Blackfoot Confederacy running between camps in Alberta, Saskatchewan and Montana.\n\nDeerfoot-Bad Meat first began running in minor local races when he was discovered by a Calgary gambling group called The Syndicate. The group was interested in finding local runners who could compete with continental champions for gambling money. Around the same time the indoor track \"Star-Rink\" was being built in Calgary which would serve as a venue for these championship foot-races. In 1883, in one of his first professional races, Deerfoot-Bad Meat defeated professional runner James Green and Blackfoot runner Little Plume in a four-day endurance race. In 16 hours, he completed 84 miles and 6 laps. Following this, Api-kai-ees was officially given the professional name Deerfoot, after the original Seneca runner Deerfoot-Red Jacket.\n\nDeerfoot-Bad Meat continued to run successfully in many more local races in the Calgary area and beyond defeating challengers from as far away as Europe. In 1886 he won the prestigious Dominion Day one-mile race, coming within a second of breaking the world record for that distance.\n\nLater that autumn, in order to showcase Canadian talent to the world, multiple gambling groups decided to organize a major ten-mile race in Calgary. Deerfoot-Bad Meat was entered to run against the favourite J.W. Strokes of Birmingham, England and George Irvine of Winnipeg, Manitoba. In what was considered the race of the decade, Deerfoot-Bad Meat overwhelmingly defeated Stokes and Irvine, beating the Englishman by a full lap. Not happy with what the Europeans considered a \"humilliating\" defeat, the handlers of the British runner claimed a miscount of laps and the race was invalidated. The organizers rescheduled a new race for several days later. Nevertheless, being already suspicious of the British team, Deerfoot-Bad Meat stepped onto the race track only after giving Stokes a six lap head-start in order to dispel any possibility of another miscount. Deerfoot nevertheless passed the Birmingham racer and finished the ten miles in 54 minutes 30 seconds.\n\nDisillusioned and disappointed with the corruption involving the gambling group The Syndicate, Deerfoot parted ways with his team in 1886 and began running as an independent with mixed success. Deerfoot died in 1897 of tuberculosis and is buried in an unmarked grave in Calgary.\n\nIn 1974 the City of Calgary renamed a major freeway, Deerfoot Trail, as well as an industrial centre and shopping venue (Deerfoot City) in his honour.\n"}

He drowned at sea in circumstances which are unclear. Edward the Elder died in 924, leaving five sons by three marriages. Of these, Edmund and Eadred were infants and thus excluded from the succession. Edward's careful work of expansion was undone when the Mercians chose Edward's oldest son Æthelstan—probably raised in Mercia at the court of Æthelflæd—to be their king while the West Saxons picked Ælfweard, elder son of Edward's second wife Ælfflæd, who was perhaps Edward's own choice as successor. Ælfweard's \"sudden and convenient\" death followed six weeks after that of his father, but Æthelstan appears not to have been recognised as king by the West Saxons until a year after his father's death, suggesting that there was considerable resistance to him and perhaps also support for Edwin.\n\nThe contemporary evidence for Edwin's life is very limited. At some point during the reign of his half-brother Æthelstan, Edwin witnessed a charter, S 1417, at New Minster, Winchester, granting lands to one Alfred, a thegn (\"minister\") of King Æthelstan. Edwin witnesses the charter immediately after his half-brother and is described as ætheling (\"clito\"). The \"Anglo-Saxon Chronicle\" states that Edwin drowned at sea in 933. The Francian \"Annales Bertiniani\" compiled by Folcuin provide more detail:\n\nLater writers such as William of Malmesbury and Simeon of Durham rewrote Edwin's death. Sir Frank Stenton saw their reports as suggesting that \"a rebellion against Athelstan may have been organised within the royal house itself\". Simeon's version baldly states that \"King Æthelstan commanded that his brother Edwin be drowned at sea\". William's account is much longer and associates Edwin's death with an earlier plot to blind Æthelstan and replace him with Edwin. In this version, Æthelstan is convinced by jealous courtiers to have Edwin sent to sea in a leaky boat, without oars, without food, and without water. Despairing, Edwin throws himself into the sea and drowns.\n\nThe \"Annales Bertiniani\" say that the monks of Saint Bertin were granted a monastery at Bath by \"King Æthelstan\" in 944—in fact King Edmund, Æthelstan having died in 939—in gratitude for their care of Edwin's remains.\n\n"}
{"id": "314522", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=314522", "title": "Ferdinand de Lesseps", "text": "Ferdinand de Lesseps\n\nFerdinand Marie, Vicomte de Lesseps, GCSI (; 19 November 1805 – 7 December 1894) was a French diplomat and later developer of the Suez Canal, which in 1869 joined the Mediterranean and Red Seas, substantially reducing sailing distances and times between Europe and East Asia.\n\nHe attempted to repeat this success with an effort to build a Panama Canal at sea level during the 1880s, but the project was devastated by epidemics of malaria and yellow fever in the area, as well as beset by financial problems, and the planned de Lesseps Panama Canal was never completed. Eventually, the project was bought out by the United States, which solved the medical problems and changed the design to a non-sea level canal with locks. It was completed in 1914.\n\nThe origins of de Lesseps' family are traceable back as far as the end of the 14th century. His ancestors, it is believed, came from Spain, and settled at Bayonne during the region's occupation by the English. One of his great-grandfathers, Pierre de Lesseps (Bayonne, 2 January 1690 – Bayonne, 20 August 1759), son of Bertrand Lesseps (1649–1708) and wife (m. 18 April 1675) Louise Fisson (1654–1690), was town clerk and at the same time secretary to Queen Anne of Neuberg, widow of Charles II of Spain, exiled to Bayonne after the accession of Philip V, and married on 7 January 1715 his great-grandmother Catherine Fourcade (2 June 1690 – 22 August 1760), by whom he had fourteen children, six of whom died in childhood: Dominique de Lesseps (1715–1794), Pierre de Lesseps (1716 – ?), Marie de Lesseps (1717–1722), Arnaud de Lesseps (1719–1726), Jean-Barthélémy de Lesseps (1720–1795), Marcel de Lesseps (1720–1730), Jean-Pierre de Lesseps (1721–1721), Catherine de Lesseps, Gracy de Lesseps (1725–1791), Plaisance de Lesseps (1727–1735), Michel de Lesseps (1729–1801), married in 1769 to Florence Verdier (1739–1822) (parents of Louise Thérèse de Lesseps (1770–1866), married in 1788 to Mathieu Belland (1764–1817), Martin de Lesseps (1730–1807), married to Anna Caysergues (1730–1823) and had issue, Jeanne de Lesseps (1733 – ?), married in 1759 to Alexandre Dubrocq, and Etiennette de Lesseps (1735 – ?), married in 1761 to Pierre Simonin.\n\nFrom the middle of the 18th century the ancestors of de Lesseps followed diplomatic careers, and he himself occupied several diplomatic posts from 1825 to 1849. His uncle was ennobled by King Louis XVI, and his father was made a count by Emperor Napoleon I. His father, Mathieu de Lesseps (Hamburg, 4 May 1774 – Tunis, 28 December 1832), was in the consular service; his mother, Catherine de Grévigné (Málaga, 11 June 1774 – Paris, 27 January 1853), was Spanish on her mother's side, and aunt of the countess of Montijo, mother of the Empress Eugénie. She was a daughter of Henri de Grevigné (baptised Notre-Dame-aux-Fonts, Liège, 2 June 1744) and wife (m. Málaga, 1766) Francisca Antonia Gallegos (1751–1853).\n\nFerdinand de Lesseps was born November 19, 1805 in Versailles, Yvelines. He had a sister, Adélaïde de Lesseps (1803–1879), married to Jules Tallien de Cabarrus (19 April 1801 – 1870), and two brothers, Théodore de Lesseps (Cádiz, 25 September 1802 – Saint-Germain-en-Laye, 20 May 1874), married in 1828 to Antonia Denois (Paris, 27 September 1802 – Paris, 29 December 1878), and Jules de Lesseps (Pisa, 16 February 1809 – Paris, 10 October 1887), married on 11 March 1874 to Hyacinthe Delarue.\n\nHis first years were spent in Italy, where his father was occupied with his consular duties. He was educated at the College of Henry IV in Paris. From the age of 18 years to 20 he was employed in the commissary department of the army. From 1825 to 1827 he acted as assistant vice-consul at Lisbon, where his uncle, Barthélemy de Lesseps, was the French \"chargé d'affaires\". This uncle was an old companion of Jean-François de La Pérouse and the only survivor of the expedition in which La Pérouse perished. Barthélemy de Lesseps had left the expedition in Kamchatka to travel to St Petersburg overland.\n\nIn 1828 de Lesseps was sent as an assistant vice-consul to Tunis, where his father was consul-general. He aided the escape of Youssouff, pursued by the soldiers of the Bey, of whom he was one of the officers, for violation of the seraglio law. Youssouff acknowledged this protection given by a Frenchman by distinguishing himself in the ranks of the French army at the time of the French conquest of Algeria. De Lesseps was also entrusted by his father with missions to Marshal Count Bertrand Clausel, general-in-chief of the army of occupation in Algeria. The marshal wrote to Mathieu de Lesseps on 18 December 1830: \"I have had the pleasure of meeting your son, who gives promise of sustaining with great credit the name he bears\".\n\nIn 1832 de Lesseps was appointed vice-consul at Alexandria. While the vessel, in which de Lesseps sailed to Egypt, was in quarantine at the Alexandrian lazaretto, M. Mimaut, consul-general of France at Alexandria, sent him several books, among which was the memoir written upon the previously filled and abandoned Ancient Suez Canal, according to Napoleon Bonaparte's instructions, by the civil engineer Jacques-Marie Le Père, one of the scientific members of the French expedition.\n\nThis work struck de Lesseps's imagination, and was one of the influences that gave him the idea of constructing a canal across the African isthmus. Fortunately for de Lesseps, Muhammad Ali, the viceroy of Egypt, owed his position in part to the recommendations made on his behalf to the French government by Mathieu de Lesseps, who was consul-general in Egypt when Ali was a colonel. Because of this, de Lesseps received a warm welcome from the viceroy and became good friends with his son, Said Pasha. Politically, the British were allied with the Ottoman capital in Constantinople - to prevent the Russians from Black Sea access to the Mediterranean Sea - and had also repelled Ali's attempt to invade the Ottoman capital in 1833. The French were able to maneuver in Egypt under Ali's graces by playing off the British aggression against Ali in Constantinople.\n\nIn 1833 de Lesseps was sent as consul to Cairo, and soon afterwards given the management of the consulate general at Alexandria, a post that he held until 1837. While in Egypt he encountered and was influenced by Barthélemy Prosper Enfantin, who was working on a barrage north of Cairo for Ali while preaching for a marriage of the Mediterranean and Red Seas. While he was there an epidemic of plague broke out and lasted for two years, resulting in the deaths of more than a third of the inhabitants of Cairo and Alexandria. During this time de Lesseps went from one city to the other with zeal and energy. Towards the close of the year 1837 he returned to France, and on 21 December married Mlle Agathe Delamalle (Garches, Hauts-de-Seine, 15 October 1819 – Paris, 13 July 1853), daughter of the government prosecuting attorney at the court of Angers. By this mariage de Lesseps became the father of five sons: Charles Théodore de Lesseps (1838–1838), Charles Aimé de Lesseps (1840–1923), Ferdinand Marie de Lesseps (1842–1846), Ferdinand Victor de Lesseps (1847–1853) and Aimé Victor de Lesseps (1848–1896).\n\nIn 1839 he was appointed consul at Rotterdam, and in the following year transferred to Málaga, the ancestral home of his mother's family. In 1842 he was sent to Barcelona, and soon afterwards promoted to the grade of consul general. In the course of a bloody insurrection in Catalonia, which ended in the bombardment of Barcelona, de Lesseps offered protection to a number of men threatened by the fighting regardless of their factional sympathies or nationalities. From 1848 to 1849 he was minister of France at Madrid.\n\nIn 1849 the government of the French Republic sent him to Rome to negotiate the return of Pope Pius IX to the Vatican. He tried to negotiate an agreement whereby Pope Pius could return peacefully to the Vatican but also ensuring the continued independence of Rome. But, during negotiations, the elections in France caused a change in the foreign policy of the government - Alexis de Tocqueville replaced the previous foreign minister. His course was disapproved; he was recalled and brought before the Council of State. Louis-Napoleon needed a scapegoat and Lessups was an easy target. Lessups was accused of causing dishonor to the French army and was censured although he was not told to leave the Foreign Ministry.\n\nHe was created on 30 August 1851 the 334th Commander and then the 200th Grand Cross of the Order of the Tower and Sword.\n\nDe Lesseps then retired from the diplomatic service, and never again occupied any public office. In 1853 he lost his wife and his son Ferdinand Victor at a few days' interval. In 1854, the accession to the viceroyalty of Egypt of Said Pasha gave de Lesseps a new impulse to act upon the creation of a Suez Canal.\n\nLessups had corresponded at least once with the Société d'Études du Canal de Suez during the reign of Abbas I in Egypt, but Abbas had closed off most of Egypt to foreign influence. Upon Abbas' assassination in 1854, Lessups, made inquiries with a former, if short-term, acquaintance and successor in Egypt, Said Pasha. On 7 November 1854 he landed at Alexandria; on the 30th of the same month Said Pasha signed the concession authorizing him to build the Suez Canal.\n\nA first scheme, initiated by de Lesseps, was immediately drawn out by two French engineers who were in the Egyptian service, Louis Maurice Adolphe Linant de Bellefonds called \"Linant Bey\" and Mougel Bey. This project, differing from others that were previously presented or that were in opposition to it, provided for a direct link between the Mediterranean and the Red Sea. After being slightly modified, the plan was adopted in 1856 by the civil engineers constituting the International Commission for the piercing of the isthmus of Suez. Encouraged by the engineers' approval, de Lesseps no longer allowed anything to stop him. He listened to no adverse criticism and receded before no obstacle. Neither the opposition of Lord Palmerston, who considered the projected disturbance as too radical and a danger to the commercial position of Great Britain. De Lesseps was similarly not deterred by the opinions entertained, in France as well as in England, that the sea in front of Port Said was full of mud which would obstruct the entrance to the canal, and that the sands from the desert would fill the trenches — no adverse argument could dishearten Lesseps.\n\nDe Lesseps succeeded in rousing the patriotism of the French and obtaining by their subscriptions more than half of the capital of two hundred million francs which he needed in order to form a company, but could not attract any substantial capital contribution from the public in England or other foreign countries. The Egyptian government thus subscribed for eighty million francs worth of shares.\n\nThe Compagnie universelle du canal maritime de Suez was organized at the end of 1858. On 25 April 1859 the first blow of the pickaxe was given by de Lesseps at Port Said. During the following ten years, de Lesseps had to overcome the continuing opposition of the British government preventing the Sultan from approving the construction of the canal, and at one stage he even had to seek the support of his cousin, Empress Eugenie, to persuade the Emperor Napoleon III to act as arbitrator in the disputes. Finally, on 17 November 1869, the canal was officially opened by the Khedive, Ismail Pasha.\nWhile in the interests of his canal de Lesseps resisted the opposition of British diplomacy to an enterprise which threatened to give France control of the shortest route to India, he acted loyally towards Great Britain after Lord Beaconsfield acquired the Suez shares belonging to the Khedive, by admitting to the board of directors of the company three representatives of the British government. The consolidation of interests which resulted, and which was strengthened by the addition in 1884 of seven more British directors, chosen from among shipping merchants and business men, increased, for the benefit of all concerned, the commercial character of the enterprise.\n\nDe Lesseps steadily endeavored to keep out of politics. If in 1869 he appeared to deviate from this principle by being a candidate at Marseille for the Corps Législatif, it was because he yielded to the entreaties of the Imperial government in order to strengthen its goodwill for the Suez Canal. Once this goodwill had been shown, he bore no malice towards those who rendered him his liberty by preferring Léon Gambetta. Afterward, de Lesseps declined the other candidatures that were offered to him: for the Senate in 1876, and for the Chamber in 1877. In 1873 he became interested in a project for uniting Europe and Asia by a railway to Bombay, with a branch to Peking. The same year, he became a member of the French Academy of Sciences. He subsequently encouraged Major Roudaire, who wished to transform a stretch of the Sahara into an inland sea to increase rainfall in Algeria.\n\nDe Lesseps accepted the presidency of the French committee of Leopold II of Belgium's International African Society. From this position he facilitated Pierre Savorgnan de Brazza's explorations, and acquired stations that he subsequently abandoned to the French government. These stations were the starting-point of French Congo. He was elected a Foreign Honorary Member of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1879.\n\nFrom 17 November 1899 to 23 December 1956, a monumental statue of Ferdinand de Lesseps by Emmanuel Frémiet stood at the entrance of the Suez Canal.\n\nIn May 1879 a congress of 136 delegates (including de Lesseps) assembled in the rooms of the Société de géographie in Paris, under the presidency of Admiral de la Roncire le Noury, and voted in favor of the creation of a Panama Canal, which was to be without locks, like the Suez Canal. De Lesseps was appointed President of the Panama Canal Company, despite the fact that he had reached the age of 74. It was on this occasion that Gambetta bestowed upon him the title of \"Le Grand Français\". However, the decision to dig a Panama Canal at sea level to avoid the use of locks, and the inability of contemporary medical science to deal with epidemics of malaria and yellow fever, doomed the project.\n\nIn February 1880, de Lesseps arrived in New York City to raise money for the project. When he stayed at the Windsor Hotel, its staff flew the French flag in his honor. He met the American Society of Civil Engineers and the Geographic Society while touring the area. De Lesseps then went to Washington D.C., met with President Rutherford Hayes, and testified to the House Interoceanic Canal Committee. He later went to Boston, Chicago, and several other American cities to raise interest and capital for the project.\n\nIn June 1880, de Lesseps gave a speech in Liverpool where he was able to find support from a Captain Peacock, who felt the canal project was worth supporting as it would provide routes to save time.\n\nDe Lesseps went with his youngest child to Panama to see the planned pathway. He estimated in 1880 that the project would take 658 million francs and eight years to complete. After two years of surveys, work on the canal began in 1882. However, the technical difficulties of operating in the wet tropics dogged the project. Particularly disastrous were recurrent landslides into the excavations from the bordering water-saturated hills, and the death toll from malaria and yellow fever. In the end, insufficient financial capital and financial corruption ended the project. The Panama Canal Company declared itself bankrupt in December 1888 and entered liquidation in February 1889.\n\nThe failure of the project is sometimes referred to as the Panama Canal Scandal, after rumors circulated that French politicians and journalists had received bribes. By 1892 it emerged that 150 French deputies had been bribed into voting for the allocation of financial aid to the Panama Canal Company, and in February 1893 de Lesseps, his son Charles (born 1849), and a number of others faced trial and were found guilty. De Lesseps was ordered to pay a fine and serve a prison sentence, but the latter was overturned by the Court of Cassation on the grounds that it had been more than three years since the crime was committed. Ultimately, in 1904 the United States bought out the assets of the Company and resumed work under a revised plan.\n\nIn Paris on November 25, 1869 he married his second wife, Mlle Louise-Hélène Autard de Bragard.\nShe was born on the island of Mauritius in 1848 at Plaines Wilhems and died on 29 January 1909 at Château de La Chesnay in Guilly, Vatan, Indre. \nShe was the daughter of Gustave Adolphe Autard de Bragard, a former Magistrate of Mauritius, and wife Marie-Louise Carcenac (1817–1857), daughter of Pierre Carcenac (1771–1819) and wife Marie Françoise Dessachis. Eleven of her twelve children with de Lesseps survived their father:\n\nOn 11 June 1884, Levi P. Morton, the Minister of the United States to France, gave a banquet in honor of the Franco-American Union and in celebration of the completion of the Statue of Liberty. Ferdinand de Lesseps, as head of the Franco-American Union, formally presented the statue to the United States, saying:\n\nThis is the result of the devoted enthusiasm, the intelligence and the noblest sentiments which can inspire man.

Today, people of French heritage make up the majority of native speakers of French in Canada, who in turn account for about 22 per cent of the country's total population. The majority of French Canadians reside in Quebec, where they constitute the majority of the province's population, although French-Canadian and francophone minority communities exist in all other Canadian provinces and territories as well.\n\nDuring the mid-18th century, Canadian colonists born in French Canada expanded across North America and colonized various regions, cities, and towns; the French Canadian settlers originated primarily from districts in the west of France, such as Normandy, Perche, Beauce, Maine, Anjou, Touraine, Poitou, Aunis, Angoumois, Saintonge and Gascony.\n\nToday, French Canadians live across North America. Most French Canadians reside in Quebec, and are more commonly referred to as \"Quebecers\" or \"Québécois\", although smaller communities exist throughout Canada and in the United States. Between 1840 and 1930, roughly 900,000 French Canadians emigrated to the United States, mostly to the New England region. Acadians (\"Acadiens\"), who reside in the Maritimes, may be included among the French Canadian group in linguistic contexts, but are considered a separate group from the French Canadians in a cultural sense due to their distinct history, much of which predates the admission of the Maritime Provinces to Canadian Confederation in 1867.\n\nFrench Canadians (including those who are no longer French-speaking) constitute the second largest ethnic group in Canada, behind those of English ancestry, and ahead of those of Scottish and Irish heritage; there is nevertheless a distinction those identifying as French Canadians and those simply identifying as French. In total, those whose ethnic origins are French Canadian, French, Québécois and Acadian number up to 11.9 million people or comprising 33.78% of the Canadian population.\n\nNot all francophone Canadians are of French-Canadian descent or heritage, as the body of French language speakers in Canada also includes significant immigrant communities from other francophone countries such as Haiti, Cameroon, Algeria, Tunisia or Vietnam — and not all French Canadians are francophone, as a significant number of people who have French Canadian ethnic roots are native English speakers.\n\nThe French Canadians get their name from \"Canada\", the most developed and densely populated region of New France during the period of French colonization in the 17th and 18th century. The original use of the term \"Canada\" referred to the land area along the St. Lawrence River, divided in three districts (Québec, Trois-Rivières, and Montréal), as well as to the \"Pays d'en Haut\" (Upper Countries), a vast and thinly settled territorial dependence north and west of Montreal which covered the whole of the Great Lakes area.\n\nFrom 1535 to the 1690s, the French word \"Canadien\" had referred to the First Nations the French had encountered in the St. Lawrence River valley at Stadacona and Hochelaga. At the end of the 17th century, \"Canadien\" became an ethnonym distinguishing the inhabitants of Canada from those of France. After World War I, English-Canadians appropriated the term \"Canadian\" and French-Canadians identified as Québécois instead.\n\nFrench Canadians living in Canada express their cultural identity using a number of terms. The \"Ethnic Diversity Survey\" of the 2006 Canadian census found that French-speaking Canadians identified their ethnicity most often as French, French Canadians, Québécois, and Acadian. The latter three were grouped together by Jantzen (2006) as \"French New World\" ancestries because they originate in Canada.\n\nJantzen (2006) distinguishes the English \"Canadian\", meaning \"someone whose family has been in Canada for multiple generations\", and the French \"Canadien\", used to refer to descendants of the original settlers of New France in the 17th and 18th centuries. \"Canadien\" was used to refer to the French-speaking residents of New France beginning in the last half of the 17th century. The English-speaking residents who arrived later from Great Britain were called \"Anglais\". This usage continued until Canadian Confederation in 1867. Confederation united several former British colonies into the Dominion of Canada, and from that time forward, the word \"Canadian\" has been used to describe both English-speaking and French-speaking citizens, wherever they live in the country.\n\nThose reporting \"French New World\" ancestries overwhelmingly had ancestors that went back at least four generations in Canada. Fourth generation Canadiens and Québécois showed considerable attachment to their ethno-cultural group, with 70% and 61%, respectively, reporting a strong sense of belonging.\n\nThe generational profile and strength of identity of French New World ancestries contrast with those of British or Canadian ancestries, which represent the largest ethnic identities in Canada. Although deeply rooted Canadians express a deep attachment to their ethnic identity, most English-speaking Canadians of British or Canadian ancestry generally cannot trace their ancestry as far back in Canada as French-speakers. As a result, their identification with their ethnicity is weaker: for example, only 50% of third generation \"Canadians\" strongly identify as such, bringing down the overall average. The survey report notes that 80% of Canadians whose families had been in Canada for three or more generations reported \"Canadian and provincial or regional ethnic identities\". These identities include French New World ancestries such as \"Québécois\" (37% of Quebec population), \"Acadian\" (6% of Atlantic provinces).\n\nSince the 1960s, French Canadians in Quebec have generally used \"Québécois\" (masculine) or \"Québécoise\" (feminine) to express their cultural and national identity, rather than \"Canadien français\" and \"Canadienne française\". Francophones who self-identify as Québécois and do not have French-Canadian ancestry may not identify as \"French Canadian\" (\"Canadien\" or \"Canadien français\"). Those who do have French or French-Canadian ancestry, but who support Quebec sovereignty, often find \"Canadien français\" to be archaic or even pejorative. This is a reflection of the strong social, cultural, and political ties that most Quebeckers of French-Canadian origin, who constitute a majority of francophone Quebecers, maintain within Quebec. It has given Québécois an ambiguous meaning which has often played out in political issues, as all public institutions attached to the Government of Quebec refer to all Quebec citizens, regardless of their language or their cultural heritage, as Québécois.\n\nThe emphasis on the French language and Quebec autonomy means that French-speakers across Canada may now self-identify as \"québécois(e)\", \"acadien(ne)\", or \"Franco-canadien(ne)\", or as provincial linguistic minorities such as \"Franco-manitobain(e)\", \"Franco-ontarien(ne)\" or \"fransaskois(e)\". Education, health and social services are provided by provincial institutions, so that provincial identities are often used to identify French-language institutions:\n\n\nAcadians residing in the provinces of New Brunswick, Prince Edward Island and Nova Scotia represent a distinct francophone culture. This group's culture and history evolved separately from the French Canadian culture of Quebec, at a time when the Maritime Provinces were \"not\" part of what was referred to as Canada, and are consequently considered a distinct culture from French Canadians.\n\nBrayons in Madawaska County, New Brunswick and Aroostook County, Maine may be identified with either the Acadians or the Québécois, or considered a distinct group in their own right, by different sources.\n\nFrench Canadians outside Quebec are more likely to self-identify as \"French Canadian\". Identification with provincial groupings varies from province to province, with Franco-Ontarians, for example, using their provincial label far more frequently than Franco-Columbians do. Some identify \"only\" with the provincial groupings, explicitly rejecting \"French Canadian\" as an identity label.\n\nDuring the mid-18th century, French Canadian explorers and colonists colonized other parts of North America in what are today Louisiana (called \"Louisianais\"), Mississippi, Missouri, Illinois, Wisconsin, Indiana, Ohio, far northern New York and the Upper Peninsula of Michigan as well as around Detroit. They also founded such cities as New Orleans and St. Louis and villages in the Mississippi Valley. French Canadians later emigrated in large numbers from Canada to the United States between the 1840s and the 1930s in search of economic opportunities in border communities and industrialized portions of New England. French-Canadian communities in the United States remain along the Quebec border in Maine, Vermont, and New Hampshire, as well as further south in Massachusetts, Rhode Island, and Connecticut. There is also a significant community of French Canadians in South Florida, particularly Hollywood, Florida, especially during the winter months. The wealth of Catholic churches named after St. Louis throughout New England is indicative of the French immigration to the area. They came to identify as Franco-American, especially those who were born American.\n\nDistinctions between French Canadian, natives of France, and other New World French identities is more blurred in the U.S. than in Canada, but those who identify as French Canadian or Franco American generally do not regard themselves as French. Rather, they identify culturally, historically, and ethnically with the culture that originated in Quebec that is differentiated from French culture. In \"L'avenir du français aux États-Unis\", Calvin Veltman and Benoît Lacroix found that since the French language has been so widely abandoned in the United States, the term \"French Canadian\" has taken on an ethnic rather than linguistic meaning.\n\nFrench Canadian identities are influenced by historical events that inform regional cultures. For example, in New England, the relatively recent immigration (19th/20th centuries) is informed by experiences of language oppression and an identification with certain occupations, such as the mill workers. In the Great Lakes, many French Canadians also identify as Métis and trace their ancestry to the earliest voyageurs and settlers; many also have ancestry dating to the lumber era and often a mixture of the two groups.\n\nThe main Franco-American regional identities are:\n\nPeople who today claim some French-Canadian ancestry or heritage number some 7 million in Canada and 2.4 million people in the United States. (An additional 8.4 million Americans claim French ancestry; they are treated as a separate ethnic group by the U.S. Census Bureau.)\n\nIn Canada, 85% of French Canadians reside in Quebec where they constitute the majority of the population in all regions except the far North. Most cities and villages in this province were built and settled by the French or French Canadians during the French colonial rule.\n\nThere are various urban and small centres in Canada outside Quebec that have long-standing populations of French Canadians, going back to the late 19th century. Eastern and Northern Ontario have large populations of francophones in communities such as Ottawa, Cornwall, Hawkesbury, Sudbury, Welland, Timmins and Windsor. Many also pioneered the Canadian Prairies in the late 18th century, founding the towns of Saint Boniface, Manitoba and in Alberta's Peace Country, including the region of Grande Prairie.\n\nThe following table shows the population of Canada's that is of French ancestry. The data is from Statistics Canada.\n\nIt is important to understand that the French-speaking population have massively chosen the \"Canadian\" (\"Canadien\") ethnic group since the government made it possible (1986), which has made the current statistics misleading. The term \"Canadien\" historically referred only to a French-speaker, though today it is used in French to describe any Canadian citizen.\n\nIt is estimated that roughly 70%-75% of Quebec's population descend from the French pioneers of the 17th and 18th century. \n\nComparative table for the 2011 Canadian census:\nIn the United States, many cities were founded as colonial outposts of New France by French or French-Canadian explorers. They include Mobile (Alabama), Coeur d'Alene (Idaho), Vincennes (Indiana), Belleville (Illinois), Bourbonnais (Illinois), Prairie du Rocher (Illinois), Dubuque (Iowa), Baton Rouge (Louisiana), New Orleans (Louisiana), Detroit (Michigan), Biloxi (Mississippi), Creve Coeur (Missouri), St. Louis (Missouri), Pittsburgh (Fort Duquesne, Pennsylvania), Provo (Utah), Green Bay (Wisconsin), La Crosse (Wisconsin), Milwaukee (Wisconsin) or Prairie du Chien (Wisconsin).\n\nThe majority of the French-Canadian population in the United States is found in the New England area, although there is also a large French-Canadian presence in Plattsburgh, New York, across Lake Champlain from Burlington, Vermont. Quebec and Acadian emigrants settled in industrial cities like Fitchburg, Leominster, Lynn, Worcester, Waltham, Lowell, Lawrence, Chicopee, Fall River, and New Bedford in Massachusetts; Woonsocket in Rhode Island; Manchester and Nashua in New Hampshire; Bristol in Connecticut; throughout the state of Vermont, particularly in Burlington, St. Albans, and Barre; and Biddeford and Lewiston in Maine. Smaller groups of French Canadians settled in the Midwest, notably in the states of Michigan, Illinois, Wisconsin, Nebraska, Iowa, Missouri, and Minnesota. French-Canadians also settled in central North Dakota, largely in Rolette and Bottineau counties, and in South Dakota.\n\nSome Metis still speak Michif, a language influenced by French, and a mixture of other European and Native American tribal languages.\n\nCanadian French is an umbrella term for the distinct varieties of French spoken by francophone Canadians: Québécois (Quebec French), Acadian French, Métis French, and Newfoundland French. Unlike Acadian French and Newfoundland French, the French of Ontario, the Canadian West, and New England all originate from what is now Quebec French and do not constitute distinct varieties from it, though there are some regional differences. French Canadians may also speak either Canadian English or American English, especially if they live in overwhelmingly English-speaking Canadian provinces or in the United States.\n\nIn Quebec, about six million French Canadians are native French speakers. 599,225 (7.7% of population) are English-speaking, Anglophones or English-speaking Quebecers, and others are Allophones (literally \"other-speakers\", meaning, in practice, immigrants who speak neither French nor English at home). In the United States, assimilation to the English language was more significant and very few Americans of French-Canadian ancestry or heritage speak French today.\n\nSix million of Canada's native French speakers, of all origins, are found in the province of Quebec, where they constitute the majority language group, and another one million are distributed throughout the rest of Canada. Roughly 31% of Canadian citizens are French-speaking and 25% are of French-Canadian descent. Not all French speakers are of French descent, and not all people of French-Canadian heritage are exclusively or primarily French-speaking.\n\nFrancophones living in Canadian provinces other than Quebec have enjoyed minority language rights under Canadian law since at least 1969, with the Official Languages Act, and under the Canadian Constitution since 1982, protecting them from provincial governments that have historically been indifferent towards their presence. At the provincial level, New Brunswick formally designates French as a full official language, while other provinces vary in the level of French language services they offer. All three of Canada's territories include French as an official language of the territory alongside English and local indigenous languages, although in practice French-language services are normally available only in the capital cities and not across the entire territory.\n\nChristianity is the predominant religion of French Canadians, with Roman Catholicism the chief denomination. The kingdom of France forbade non-Catholic settlement in New France from 1629 onward and thus, almost all French settlers of Canada were Catholic. In the United States, some families of French-Canadian origin have converted to Protestantism. Until the 1960s, religion was a central component of French-Canadian national identity. The Church parish was the focal point of civic life in French-Canadian society, and religious orders ran French-Canadian schools, hospitals and orphanages and were very influential in everyday life in general. During the Quiet Revolution of the 1960s, however, the practice of Catholicism dropped drastically. Church attendance in Quebec currently remains low. Rates of religious observance among French Canadians outside Quebec tend to vary by region, and by age. In general, however, those in Quebec are the least observant, while those in the United States of America and other places away from Quebec tend to be the most observant.\n\nFrench Canadians have selectively bred distinct livestock over the centuries, including cattle, horses and chickens.\n\nTraditionally Canadiens had a subsistence agriculture in Eastern Canada (Québec), this subsistence agriculture slowly evolved in dairy farm during the end of the 19th century and the beginning of 20th century while retaining the subsistence side. By 1960 agriculture changed toward an industrial agriculture.\n\nThe French were the first Europeans to permanently colonize what is now Quebec, parts of Ontario, Acadia, and select areas of Western Canada, all in Canada (See French colonization of the Americas.) Their colonies of New France (also commonly called Canada) stretched across what today are the Maritime provinces, southern Quebec and Ontario, as well as the entire Mississippi River Valley.\n\nThe first permanent European settlements in Canada were at Port Royal in 1605 and Quebec City in 1608 as fur trading posts. The territories of New France were Canada, Acadia (later renamed Nova Scotia), and Louisiana. The inhabitants of Canada called themselves the \"Canadiens\", and came mostly from northwestern France. The early inhabitants of Acadia, or \"Acadiens\", came mostly but not exclusively from the Southwestern region of France. \"Canadien\" explorers and fur traders would come to be known as \"coureurs des bois\", while those who settled on farms in Canada would come to be known as \"habitants\". Many French Canadians are the descendants of the King's Daughters of this era. Many also are the descendants of mixed French and Algonquin marriages.\n\nDuring the mid-18th century, French explorers and \"Canadiens\" born in French Canada colonized other parts of North America in what are today the states of Louisiana (called \"Louisianais\"), Mississippi, Missouri, Illinois, Vincennes, Indiana, Louisville, Kentucky, the Windsor-Detroit region and the Canadian prairies (primarily Southern Manitoba).\nAfter the 1760 British conquest of New France in the French and Indian War (known as the Seven Years' War in Canada), the French-Canadian population remained important in the life of the colonies.\n\nThe British gained Acadia by the Treaty of Utrecht in 1713. In 1755, the beginning of the French and Indian War, the British—ally British Americans from Massachusetts—committed what historian John Mack Faragher calls the first genocide by devastating Acadia, deporting 75% of the Acadian population to other British colonies and France in a massive diaspora. Those Acadians deported to Southern colonies close to French Louisiana migrated there, creating \"Cajun\" culture. Beyond Acadia, French Canadians escaped this fate in part because of the capitulation act that made them British subjects. It took the 1774 Quebec Act for them to regain the French civil law system, and in 1791 French Canadians in Lower Canada were introduced to the British parliamentary system when an elected Legislative Assembly was created.\n\nThe Legislative Assembly having no real power, the political situation degenerated into the Lower Canada Rebellions of 1837–1838, after which Lower Canada and Upper Canada were unified. Some of the motivations for the union was to limit French-Canadian political power and at the same time transferring a large part of the Upper Canadian debt to the debt-free Lower Canada. After many decades of British immigration, the \"Canadiens\" became a minority in the Province of Canada in the 1850s.\n\nFrench-Canadian contributions were essential in securing responsible government for The Canadas and in undertaking Canadian Confederation. However, over the course of the late 19th and 20th centuries, French Canadians' discontent grew with their place in Canada because of a series of events, including the execution of Louis Riel, the elimination of official bilingualism in Manitoba, Canada's participation in the Second Boer War, Regulation 17 which banned French-language schools in Ontario, the Conscription Crisis of 1917 and the Conscription Crisis of 1944.\n\nBetween the 1840s and the 1930s, some 900,000 French Canadians emigrated to the New England region. About half of them returned home. The generations born in the United States would eventually come to see themselves as Franco-Americans. During the same period of time, numerous French Canadians also emigrated and settled in Eastern and Northern Ontario. The descendants of those Quebec immigrants constitute the bulk of today's Franco-Ontarian community.\n\nSince 1968, French has been one of Canada's two official languages. It is the sole official language of Quebec and one of the official languages of New Brunswick, Yukon, the Northwest Territories and Nunavut. The province of Ontario has no official languages defined in law, although the provincial government provides French language services in many parts of the province under the French Language Services Act.\n\nIn English usage, the terms for provincial subgroups, if used at all, are usually defined solely by province of residence, with all of the terms being strictly interchangeable with French Canadian. Although this remains the more common usage in English, it is considered outdated to many Canadians of French descent, especially in Quebec. Most francophone Canadians who use the provincial labels identify with their province of origin, even if it is not the province in which they currently reside; for example, a Québécois who moved to Manitoba would not normally change their own self-identification to Franco-Manitoban.\n\nIncreasingly, provincial labels are used to stress the linguistic and cultural, as opposed to ethnic and religious, nature of French-speaking institutions and organizations. The term \"French Canadian\" is still used in historical and cultural contexts, or when it is necessary to refer to Canadians of French-Canadian heritage collectively, such as in the name and mandate of national organizations which serve francophone communities across Canada. Francophone Canadians of non-French-Canadian origin such as immigrants from francophone countries are not usually designated by the term \"French Canadian\" the more general term \"francophones\" is used for French-speaking Canadians across all ethnic origins.\n\n\n\n"}

He was arrested in February 1977 and died shortly after. Although the official account describes a car crash, it is generally accepted that he was murdered on the orders of then-President Idi Amin.\n\nSince 2015 Uganda has a public holiday on 16 February, to celebrate the life of Janani Luwum.\n\nLuwum was born in the village of Mucwini in the Kitgum District to Acholi parents. He attended Gulu High School and Boroboro Teacher Training College, after which he taught at a primary school. Luwum converted to Christianity in 1948, and in 1949 he went to Buwalasi Theological College. In 1950 he was attached to St. Philip's Church in Gulu. He was ordained a deacon in 1953, and the following year he was ordained a priest. He served in the Upper Nile Diocese of Uganda and later in the Diocese of Mbale. In 1969 he was consecrated Bishop of the Diocese of Northern Uganda at Gulu. After five years he was appointed Archbishop of the Metropolitan Province of Uganda, Rwanda, Burundi, and Boga (in Zaire), becoming the second African to hold this position.\n\nArchbishop Luwum was a leading voice in criticising the excesses of the Idi Amin regime that assumed power in 1971. In 1977, Archbishop Luwum delivered a note of protest to dictator Idi Amin against the policies of arbitrary killings and unexplained disappearances. Shortly afterwards the archbishop and other leading churchmen were accused of treason.\nOn 16 February 1977, Luwum was arrested together with two cabinet ministers, Erinayo Wilson Oryema and Charles Oboth Ofumbi. The same day Idi Amin convened a rally in Kampala with the three accused present. A few other \"suspects\" were paraded forth to read out \"confessions\" implicating the three men. The archbishop was accused of being an agent of the exiled former president Milton Obote, and for planning to stage a coup. The next day, Radio Uganda announced that the three had been killed when the car transporting them to an interrogation center had collided with another vehicle. The accident, Radio Uganda reported, had occurred when the victims had tried to overpower the driver in an attempt to escape. When Luwum's body was released to his relatives, it was riddled with bullets. Henry Kyemba, minister of health in Amin's government, later wrote in his book \"A State of Blood\", that \"The bodies were bullet-riddled. The archbishop had been shot through the mouth and at least three bullets in the chest. The ministers had been shot in a similar way but one only in the chest and not through the mouth. Oryema had a bullet wound through the leg.\"\n\nAccording to the later testimony of witnesses, the victims had been taken to an army barracks, where they were bullied, beaten and finally shot. \"Time\" magazine said \"Some reports even had it that Amin himself had pulled the trigger, but Amin angrily denied the charge, and there were no first-hand witnesses\".\n\nJanani Luwum was survived by a widow, Mary Lawinyo Luwum and nine children. He was buried at his home village of Mucwini in the Kitgum District. He is recognised as a martyr by the Church of England and the Anglican Communion and his death is commemorated on 17 February as a Lesser Festival. His statue is among the Twentieth Century Martyrs on the front of Westminster Abbey in London.\n\n\n"}

She became the oldest living person on 11 January 1988 at 112, one hundred years after encountering Vincent van Gogh, who visited her father's shop. She was declared the oldest person ever on 17 October 1995 at 120.\n\nAlthough Calment came from a long-living family, there is no particular explanation for her remarkable longevity. She had lived a comfortable and stress-free life, with a healthy appetite and a daily exercise routine, enabling her to walk without a stick until 114.\n\nCalment was born in Arles, Bouches-du-Rhône, Southern France on 21 February 1875. Her father, Nicolas Calment (8 November 1837– 28 January 1931), was a shipbuilder, and her mother, Marguerite Gilles (20 February 1838 – 18 September 1924), was from a family of millers. She had an older brother, François (25 April 1865 – 1 December 1962). Some of her close family members also lived an above-average lifespan, although none lived anywhere near as long as Jeanne: her older brother François lived to the age of 97, her father to 93, and her mother to 86.\n\nFrom the age of seven until her first holy communion, Jeanne Calment attended Madame Benet's church primary school in Arles, and then attended the local college, finishing at the age of 16 with the diploma \"brevet Classique\", after which she continued to live with her parents, awaiting marriage, painting, and improving her piano skills. On 8 April 1896, at the age of 21, she married her double second cousin, Fernand Nicolas Calment (1868–1942). Their paternal grandfathers were brothers, hence the same surname and their paternal grandmothers were also sisters. Fernand was a wealthy shop owner and she moved into the apartments above his shop \"Grands Magasins de Nouveautés\", where she lived until the age of 110. His wealth made it possible for Calment never to have to work; instead they led a leisured lifestyle within the upper society of Arles, pursuing hobbies such as fencing, cycling (at Saint-Rémy-de-Provence), tennis, swimming, rollerskating at Alyscamps, and playing the piano and making music with friends.\n\nIn the summer, the couple would stay at Uriage for mountaineering all the way up to the glacier. She also went hunting with her husband in the hills of the Provence to shoot rabbits and wild boars, but disliked killing birds. She considered the most important historical event in her lifetime to have been the Russian Revolution of 1917 and the execution of the Russian imperial family, a view shared by many fellow centenarians. The Second World War had little effect on her life in the south of France. German soldiers slept in her rooms but she bore no grudge against them because \"they did not take anything away\". In 1942, Fernand ate cherries treated with copper sulfate the day before, developed jaundice, and died of the poisoning in the course of one and a half months on 2 October 1942 at the age of 73. Jeanne had eaten fewer of the cherries and survived.\n\nTheir only child, a daughter named Yvonne Marie Nicolle Calment (19 January 1898 – 19 January 1934), produced a grandson, Frédéric Billiot, on 23 December 1926. Yvonne died from pneumonia, after which Calment raised Frédéric herself. Frédéric became a doctor, and lived with her until his death in an automobile accident in 1963.\nIn 1965, at age 90 and with no heirs, Calment signed a contract to sell her apartment to lawyer André-François Raffray, retaining a life estate. Raffray, then aged 47 years, agreed to pay her a monthly sum of 2,500 francs (€381.12) until she died. Raffray ended up paying Calment the equivalent of more than €140,000, more than double the apartment's value. After Raffray's death from cancer at the age of 77, in 1995, his family continued the payments until Calment's death. Calment's comment on this situation was reported to be, \"In life, one sometimes makes bad deals.\" During all these years, Calment used to say to them that she \"competed with Methuselah\". In 1985, she moved into a nursing home, having lived on her own until age 110.\n\nOn 20 June 1986 Jeanne Calment became the oldest living person in France at the age of 111 when Eugenie Roux died. Her international fame escalated in 1988, when the centenary of Vincent van Gogh's visit to Arles provided an occasion to meet reporters. She said at the time that she had met Van Gogh 100 years before, in 1888, as a thirteen-year-old girl in her uncle's shop, where he bought some canvas, later describing him as \"ugly\" (\"laid\"), \"blighted by alcohol\" (\"brûlé par l'alcool\"), and visiting brothels (\"il fréquentait des maisons de tolérance\").\n\nAfter her 1988 interview, at age 112, Calment was given the Guinness World Records title for the world's ‘Oldest person (living)’ upon the death of Florence Knapp on 11 January 1988. In 1989, however, the title was withdrawn and given to Carrie C. White of Florida, who claimed to have been born in 1874, although this was discounted by subsequent census research. Upon White's death on 14 February 1991, Calment, then a week shy of 116, became recognized as the oldest living person, though there are unverified claims that older people were alive at the time (see Longevity claims and Longevity myths).\n\nAt the age of 114, she appeared briefly in the 1990 film \"Vincent and Me\" as herself, becoming the oldest person ever to appear in a motion picture.\n\nA documentary film about her life, entitled \"Beyond 120 Years with Jeanne Calment\", was released in 1995. In 1996, \"Time's Mistress\", a four-track CD of Calment speaking over a background of rap, was released.\n\nOn 17 October 1995, Calment reached 120 years and 238 days to become the \"oldest person ever\" according to Guinness, surpassing Shigechiyo Izumi of Japan, whose claim (120 years 237 days old at the time of his death on 21 February 1986, which was Calment's 111th birthday) was discounted in February 2011, more than thirteen years after Calment's death.\nExceeding any other longevity case reported, Calment establishes the record as the most verifiable supercentenarian ever recorded. For example, beginning with the 1876 census (Calment is listed as a one-year-old), she was indexed in fourteen census documents until 1975.\n\nAfter her death, 116-year-old Marie-Louise Meilleur became the oldest recognized living person. Both before and after Calment's death, there have been several claims to have surpassed her age (see Unverified longevity claims), but none of these have been proven and Calment therefore continues to hold the record for the oldest verified person ever.\n\nCalment's remarkable health presaged her later record. On television she stated \"J'ai jamais été malade, jamais, jamais\" (I have never been ill, never ever). Asked about her daily routine while at primary school, she replied that \"when you are young you get up at eight o'clock\". In lieu of a solid breakfast she would have either white coffee or hot chocolate, and at noon her father would pick her up from school to have lunch at home before she returned to school for the afternoon. \n\nAt age 15 her cousin and eventual husband started courting her, but she was too young to be interested in boys and preferred sweets. At age 20, incipient cataracts were discovered when she suffered a major episode of conjunctivitis. After marriage at 21, her husband's wealth made it possible for Calment never to have to work. They led an active life including fencing, cycling (at Saint-Rémy-de-Provence), tennis, swimming, rollerskating at Alyscamps (\"I fell flat on my face\"), and playing the piano and making music with friends. In the summer, the couple would stay at Uriage for mountaineering up to the glacier (\"Even at 16 I had good legs\"). She also went hunting with her husband in the hills of the Provence to shoot rabbits and wild boars. Her husband introduced her to smoking, offering cigarettes after a meal, but it was not her passion. (\"After the meal, after just one, I'd had enough of it\".) Calment is known to have smoked in her elderly years, and is claimed to have smoked tobacco cigarettes from the age of 21 (1896) to 117 (1992). According to one source, she smoked no more than two cigarettes per day and it is not known whether she inhaled, whereas an earlier medical source states that she smoked cigars with her husband before changing to cigarettes more recently. \n\nAll her life she took care of her skin with olive oil and a puff of powder to finish off. On Sundays she went to Mass, and on Fridays to vespers, and regularly conversed with and sought help from God, but expressed skepticism about an afterlife. At an unspecified time in her youth, she had suffered from migraines. \n\nShe and her husband sometimes travelled to nearby Marseilles where, at the \"Phocéen\" restaurant, they treated themselves to seafood, a glass of white wine, and bread and butter. Unlike her husband she did not enjoy pastries, but she did like creams (\"crèmes\"), cakes and in particular \"quatre-quarts\" (pound cake), and vanilla ice cream. At \"retirement age\" she broke her ankle and apart from that had never been ill. She continued cycling until her hundredth birthday. Around her hundredth year she fractured her leg but recovered quickly and was able to walk again. \n\nAfter the death of her grandson in August 1963, Calment lived on her own from age 88 until shortly before her 110th birthday, when she decided to move to a nursing home. Her move was precipitated by the winter of 1985 which froze the water pipes in her house (she never used heating in the winter) and caused frostbite in her hands. According to one of her doctors, she had formerly been healthy but began showing signs of senescence (or aging) at this point.\n\nAfter her admission to the care home \"Maison du Lac\" [House on the Lake] in January 1985 at the age of 109, she initially had a highly ritualized daily routine whereby, uniquely among the care home residents, she requested to be woken at 6:45 am and started the day with a long prayer at her window thanking God for being alive and for the beautiful day which was starting, sometimes loudly asking the reason for her longevity and why she was the only one alive in her family. Seated on her armchair she did gymnastics wearing her stereo headset. Her exercises included flexing and extending the hands (\"a distinguished woman must have beautiful hands\"), then the legs, and her carers noted that she moved faster than the other residents, who were 30 years younger, despite her blindness. Her breakfast consisted of coffee with milk, and rusks. \n\nHer morning ablutions included washing herself unassisted with a flannel rather than taking a shower (\"an odd invention\"), and applying first soap, then olive oil and powder to her face. She washed her own glass and cutlery before proceeding to lunch. She enjoyed \"daube\" (braised beef) but was not keen on boiled fish. After the meal she smoked a Dunhill cigarette (formerly a cigar, a habit she had acquired from her husband) and drank a small amount of Port wine. She enjoyed chocolate (and at the age of 112 received a delivery of 800 kilogrammes after challenging a TV presenter – this was then distributed to care homes), and made herself daily a fruit salad based on banana slices and squeezed orange. \n\nIn the afternoon she would take a nap for two hours in her armchair, and then visit her neighbours in the care home, telling them about the latest news she had heard on the radio. At nightfall she would dine quickly, return to her room, listen to music (her eyesight now being too poor for her favorite pastime of crosswords), smoke a last cigarette and go to bed at 10pm.\n\nMedical student Georges Garoyan published a thesis on Calment when she was 114 years old in January 1990. The first part records her daily routine (see above), and the second presents her medical history. According to this, she had been vaccinated as a child but could not remember the vaccine. Apart from aspirin against migraines she had never taken medicines, not even herbal teas, and had never had German measles, chickenpox, hypertension, diabetes or urinary infections. Concerning her heart, she presented with a moderate left ventricular dysfunction. In April 1986 at age 111 she was admitted to hospital for heart failure and treated with digoxin. More recently she had presented with arthropathies in the ankles, elbows and wrists which were successfully treated with anti-inflammatory medication. Clinical examination revealed arterial blood pressures of 140mm/70mm, a temperature of 37 Celsius, a pulse of 84/min, a height of 150 cm and a weight of 45 kilogrammes which had varied little in previous years. She scored well on mental tests except on numeric tasks and recall of recent events. Her blood values were normal between ages 111–114, with no signs of dehydration, anaemia, chronic infection or renal impairment. Genetic analysis of the HLA system revealed the presence of the DR1 allele, common among centenarians. The electrocardiogramme revealed left ventricular hypertrophy with a mild left atrial dilatation and extrasystolic arrhythmia. Radiology revealed diffuse osteoporosis and in the right hip, incipient osteoarthritis. Ultrasound revealed no anomalies of internal organs.\n\nAt this stage Calment was still in good shape, and continued to walk without a cane until she fractured her femur during a fall at age 114 (January 1990), which required surgery. After her operation, Calment required a wheelchair and abandoned her daily routine.\n\nAt the age of 115 she attracted the attention of researchers Jean-Marie Robine and Dr. Michel Allard, who collaborated with Calment's attending doctor, Dr. Victor Lèbre to interview her, verify her age and identify factors promoting her longevity. They analysed her for over a year and reported that Jeanne Calment's vision was severely impaired by bilateral cataracts, yet she refused to have a routine operation to restore her vision; she had a moderately weak heart and a chronic cough (\"caused no doubt by her previous use of tobacco\") and bouts of rheumatism. On the other hand, she always had good digestion, slept well and had no problems with incontinence. During the last years her height was 4 ft 6 in [137 cm] and her weight was 88 pounds [40 kg]; she confirmed that she had always been small, but she had lost weight in recent years. In terms of pigmentation, her eyes were light gray and her white hair had once been chestnut brown.\n\nWith regards to her diet, the three researchers' interviews revealed that in the care home she said she always had a dessert with every meal. She complained about the blandness of the food in the care home and, given a choice, would wish to order fried and spicy foods. She occasionally (\"more than once\") feasted on chocolate in her old age: sometimes over a kilogram (2.2 lb) of chocolate per week.\n\nAt the age of 118, over a period of six months, she was submitted to neurophysiological tests and a CT scan. The tests showed that her verbal memory and language fluency was comparable to that of persons with the same level of education in their eighties and nineties. Frontal brain lobe functions were relatively spared from deterioration and there was no evidence of progressive neurological disease, depressive symptoms or other functional illness. Her cognitive functioning was in fact found to improve slightly over the six-month period. Calment reportedly remained mentally intact until the end of her life.\n\nApocryphal media articles reported varying details. One report claimed that Calment recalled selling \"coloured pencils\" to Van Gogh, and seeing the Eiffel Tower being built. Another wrote that she did not start fencing until age 85 (1960). Calment reportedly ascribed her longevity and relatively youthful appearance for her age to a diet rich in olive oil. She is also said to have credited her calmness, saying, \"That's why they call me Calment.\"\n\nBertrand Jeune, Jean-Marie Robine and colleagues compared Jeanne Calment with a list of nearly 20 people worldwide who had securely been verified to have attained at least 115 years of age. The researchers concluded that the lives of these people differed widely, and that there were but few common characteristics: the overwhelming majority were female (only two were male), most smoked little or not at all, and they had never been obese. They all seem to have had strong characters, but certainly not all were domineering personalities. Although they aged slowly, all became very frail and their physical functions declined markedly, especially after their 105th birthdays. In their final years they required wheelchairs, and were nearly blind and deaf. \"But they did not fear death, and they appeared to be reconciled to the fact their lives would soon end\".\n\nOn her 122nd birthday on 21 February 1997, it was announced that she would make no more public appearances, as her health had seriously deteriorated. Demographer Jean-Marie Robine, a co-author of a book about Jeanne Calment, reportedly said that this \"allowed her to die, as the attention had kept her alive\", while the \"New York Times\" reported Robine to have stated that she had been in good health, though almost blind and deaf, as recently as a month before her death. Jeanne Calment died on 4 August 1997 around 10 am Central European Time of unspecified causes. According to the researchers, the care home committed her body quickly and in a strictly private ceremony to a coffin, which was then solemnly driven by limousine through Arles, stopping at her house in the \"rue Gambetta\", and finally to the cemetery, where her doctor placed on her coffin the photographs of her daughter and grandson, in accordance with her wishes.\n\n\n\n"}

In 2005, Fishbein alleged that an NIH-funded clinical trial of the antiretroviral drug nevirapine, conducted in Africa, was invalid because of poor data collection, faulty record-keeping, and lax quality control. The NIH subsequently attempted to fire Fishbein, and he sought protection as a whistleblower.\n\nThe clinical trial in question was the HIVNET 012 study, which tested the antiretroviral drug nevirapine, used in some developing countries as a cost-effective method to prevent transmission of HIV from mother to unborn child. Fishbein was among several NIH employees to raise concerns about the study; he alleged that the NIH had become \"so heavily invested in the trial's outcome\" that it had lost objectivity about the quality of the result. Internal NIH documents showed that concerns had been raised about HIVNET012, but that the Institute did not notify the Bush Administration before the launch of a major project to subsidize nevirapine use in Africa to combat the spread of HIV. The NIH subsequently attempted to fire Fishbein; he alleged that the attempted dismissal was in retaliation for his complaints about HIVNET 012, while the agency cited poor performance during a probationary period as the cause for firing.\n\nIn response to the allegations of Fishbein and others, the Institute of Medicine conducted an independent review of HIVNET 012 methodology and findings. The institute's review concluded that nevirapine was safe and effective in the prevention of mother-to-child HIV transmission, as HIVNET 012 had found, and that the study's methodology was sufficiently sound that scientists and policy-makers could rely on the study's findings.\n"}

He was one the reputed Railway Contractors of his times and his exploits were mentioned by British authorities. He is also credited by them to be the first Indian to break monopoly of Europeans in Jharia coalfields. He established his first Colliery name \"Khas Jharia Colliery\" in 1895 and moved on to establish five more by 1910. He was also a financing partner in many coalfields of Jharia coal belt and additionally worked as a Private Banker. With his half-brother, Jetha Lira Jethwa (1862-1932) he owned Khas Jinagora Colliery, which operated under name & style of \"J. & K. Ramji\".\n\nAs per British records – a few lines are quoted – \n\nSome of the works done by Khora Ramji Chawda of Sinugra are : 1880 : Hubli Loco Shed & other Works, 100 Miles work in North Western Railway, 20 Miles Work in Southern Maratta Railway, 177 miles in 1182–84 Hotgi to Gadag with his brothers in SMR, 22 Miles Railway in East Bengal Railway, 1888 – 128 miles in Bilaspur to Jharsuguda with fellow Mistris section including Bridge over Champa River in BNR, in 1894 Jharia Branch line of EIR, 1895 : Railway line in East Coast Railway & Bridge over Ganjam. His last Railway work was in 1903 : Bridge over Ganges river in Allahbad – Lucknow section. While working for this bridge, he was harassed by Engineer I.L. Gail, so he decided to stop Railway Contracts. By this time since 1895 to 1901 he had already started two collieries in Jharia. I.E. Gail later realised his mistake and offered him contracts in other section. But Khora Ramji declined the offer and diverted all his energy to Coal Mining business, in which he was assisted by his & his brother's son. He also became a Private Banker. He rose to such a height by 1920 and became \"Seth\" Khora Ramji from Khora Ramji that British had to mention his name in Encyclopaedia of Bengal, Bihar & Orissa. He had studied up to fourth standard in his native village school but still managed to erect & build Railway bridges requiring deep technical knowledge and mathematical calculations.\n\nKhora Ramji and Brothers established collieries at Khas Jharia, Jeenagora, Jamadoba, Balihari, Fatehpur, Gareria, Bansjora & Bagadih. In Pure Jharia Colliery Khora Ramji and brothers were partners with Diwan Bahadur D.D. Thacker. Khora Ramji was also partner in Khimji Walji & Company's \"Indian Jharia Colliery\" located at Tisra.\n\nThe credit of being first Indian to break the monopoly of British in Jharia Coalfields goes to \"Seth\" Khora Ramji Chawda of Sinugra. In the life sketch of Khora Ramji given in \"Encyclopedia of Bengal, Bihar & Orissa\" – the British have noted this fact in year 1920 – \"In Jharia Coalfield he was first Indian to seize the opportunity and by his prompt entry into colliery business, he was able to remove the stigma that would otherwise be levelled against his community as backward class.\" Further, details are given in the book \"Diary of Golden Days at Jharia – A Memoir & History of Gurjar Kashtriya Samaj of Kutch in Coalfields of Jharia – written by Natwarlal Devram Jethwa\" -Quote: He similarly purchased about eight coal-fields from years 1895–1909. Further, he also encouraged fellow Mistri contractors to purchase the land and even financed them to do so. He later approached Raja of Jharia for lease of mining rights and laid foundation of his colliery business. The location of his three collieries named Jeenagora, Khas Jherria, Gareria is mentioned also in 1917 Gazetteers of Bengal, Assam, Bihar & Orissa.:- Unquote As per details given in \"Diary of Golden Days at Jharia – A Memoir & History of Gurjar Kashtriya Samaj of Kutch in Coalfields of Jharia – written by Natwarlal Devram Jethwa\" – Quote: \"Seth Khora Ramji headed the first association as mentioned by British authorities in \"Encyclopaedia Bengal, Bihar & Orissa (1920)\".\nKhora Ramji died in year 1923. Several after his death two of his collieries, Khas Jharia & Golden Jharia, which worked on maximum 260-foot-deep shafts, collapsed due to now infamous underground fires, in which their house & bungalow also collapsed on 8 November 1930, causing 18 feet subsidence and widespread destruction. The coal mines at that time were run by his sons Karamshi Khora, Ambalal Khora and others. Ambalal Khora also carried on father's legacy as a railway contractor, who died in a railway accident. The Khas Jeenagora mine was later on run solely by sons of Jetha Lira Jethwa, Karsanjee Jethabhai and later Devram Jethabhai till 1938–39 after which the mine was sold.\n\nHowever, business of some other coal mines of Seth Khora Ramji were carried on by his brothers and successors, which were finally taken over by government when the coal mines in India were nationalised in 1971–72.\n\nAs a philanthropist, in his native village Sinugra, he had built and donated in year 1910 a Hindu temple, wells, welcome-gate, Chabutro and a primary school, which is now named \"Seth Khora Ramji Prathmik Shala\". He also donated major fund along with some other Mistri colliery owners to start a Gujarati school named the Jharia Anglo-Gujarati School at Jharia in 1905. He also owned farm-lands, the produce of which was given away to poor and needy. In the year 1920, when he held a large public charity event and a yagna at Sinugra, he was honoured by Maharao of Cutch, Khengarji III, who sent him a \"Paghdi\". Further, at Mathura he along with Jetha Lira Jethwa of Sinugra had built and donated a Dharamashala now named \"Kutch Kadia Dharamshala\" in the years 1889–1900, when they were stationed there for railway contract job.\n\n"}

Throughout the era of feudalism, when life was mostly confined to one's near environment, this ethnic group retained its Estonian identity and ethnographic features. Ludza Estonians were originally Lutherans, but became Catholics and had close contacts with neighbouring Latgalians and Belarusians. As long as the church ceremonies and confessions were held in Estonian, the people had little need to speak Latvian or Belarusian. Nevertheless, the local Latgalian dialect of Latvian, Belarusian, and Russian were spoken to a certain extent in the areas were those people were their neighbours. In manors, Polish was heard (in Latgale, it was the administrative language at the time).\n\nBy the 19th century the church had become Latvianised and Russian had become the official language and lingua franca. According to Oskar Kallas, who made a studying trip to area in 1893, there were 4,387 Ludza Estonians of whom some 800 could speak Estonian. In the 1970s and 80s, there were some 20 people left in the area still using the language, but it is now most likely to have perished. The dialect spoken by Ludza Estonians, was closely related to eastern Võro-dialects. It contained about 180 loanwords from Latvian language and some from Russian. Ludza Estonians reportedly had some difficulty understanding standard Estonian.\n\n"}
{"id": "19120446", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=19120446", "title": "Magomed Yevloyev", "text": "Magomed Yevloyev\n\nMagomed Yakhyаvich Yevloyev (Магомед Яхьявич Евлоев; 1971 – 31 August 2008) was an Ingush journalist, lawyer, and businessman, and the owner of the news website Ingushetiya.ru, known for being highly critical of Murat Zyazikov, the President of Ingushetia, a federal subject of Russia locating in the North Caucasus region. Magomed Yevloyev is not to be confused with the Ingush rebel leader Akhmed Yevloyev, who is also known as Magomed, or with the 20-year-old also named Magomed Yevloyev who is suspected of being a suicide bomber in the Domodedovo International Airport bombing.\n\nMagomed Yevloyev was born in the town of Malgobek, Chechen-Ingush Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic (now in the Republic of Ingushetia, Russia) in 1971. In 1992, Yevloyev graduated from Saratov Law Institute (Саратовский Юридический Институт).\n\nAfter graduation, Yevloyev began to work as a public procurator in Ingushetia. He soon became the Deputy Chief Procurator of Malgobek. In 1999, he was accused of complicity in the murder of Suleyman Tsechoyev, who was at that time imprisoned as a kidnapper. Allegedly Yevloyev had signed the permit allowing the murderers to take Tsechoyev from his cell. The accusations were not proven but Yevloyev resigned from his post as a prosecutor.\n\nIn 2001, Yevloyev founded the Moscow legal firm Infra-Yur. In 2008, the firm became Infra Holding, a company which oversaw construction, fishing, legal firms, and security bureaus. It also controlled Infra North America, a daughter firm operating in the United States. Yevloyev was the president of this holding.\n\nAlso in 2001, Yevloyev created the website \"Ingushetia.ru\". Originally there was no intention to make an opposition website; Yevloyev planned to host a neutral collection of materials on the history and culture of the Ingush people, without favoring any particular point of view. But he soon found that historical and cultural materials often included explosive political content as well, and the site became a source of political materials, such as information on the Second Chechen War, counter-terrorist operations, the Ossetian–Ingush conflict, and kidnappings and murders in Ingushetia. Many of these materials were highly critical of Ingushetia President Murat Zyazikov and his government.\n\nIn July 2007, the public procurator of Moscow's Kuntsevo municipality initiated a criminal case accusing Yevloyev of \"inciting inter-ethnic hatred\", though in the end Yevloyev was never indicted for any criminal activities. In October 2007, the Tsechoyev murder case was reopened and Yevloyev's family house in Malgobek was searched. After the search, Yevloyev's father, Yakhyu Yevloyev, convinced his son to publicly sever all ties with the Ingushetia.ru site, as it appeared to be too dangerous. Since then, the site has been controlled by an editorial committee chaired by Ibragim Kostoyev.\n\nYevloyev did not, however, completely withdraw from the politics of Ingushetia. He was one of the organizers of the \"I did not vote\" campaign, intended to expose mass voter fraud in Ingushetia during the 2008 Russian presidential election. According to official data, 98% of eligible Ingushetia voters took part in the elections, almost all voting for Dmitry Medvedev. But Yevloyev alleged that less than half of registered voters had actually participated in the elections, and therefore sought to compile a list of people who could personally guarantee that they did not vote in the election. If the list proved to include more than 2% of Ingushetia's voting registry, it might constitute proof of massive election fraud.\n\nYevloyev also organized and financed a campaign collecting signatures calling for the removal of Ingushetia President Zyazikov, and the restoration of the previous Ingushetia president Ruslan Aushev.\n\nIn the beginning of 2008, the office of the Ingushetia public procurator initiated hearings in Kuntsevo Court, demanding that access to the site Ingushetia.ru be restricted. According to the prosecutors, in an interview with Ingushetia businessman Musa Keligov hosted on the site, Keligov directly accused Zyazikov of connections with guerillas. The prosecutors argued that this material constituted libel as well as \"public advocacy of extremist activity\". In May 2008, the court issued an injunction demanding that Russian providers \"limit access to the site by filtering its IP addresses\". In June 2008, the court characterized the site as \"extremist\" and demanded its closure. The site was not closed. According to Ingushetia.ru's lawyer Kaloy Akhilgov, since the site is registered in the United States, it is therefore outside the jurisdiction of Russian courts. Akhilgov also stated that the decision is technically incorrect because it classifies the site under the heading \"mass media\" despite the fact that the site is not officially registered as such. Akhilgov added that they intended to appeal the court decision.\n\nOn 31 August 2008, Magomed Yevloyev was shot in the temple and killed while in police custody. Weeks before his killing, it was rumoured that Magomed knew his life was in danger and he had planned on seeking political asylum in a European Union country. Local police claimed that Yevloyev was shot after he had attempted to grab an assault rifle from one of the police officers in the car. Human rights groups have rejected this account of Yevloyev's death, and the United States State Department has called for an investigation of the killing and for those responsible to be \"held to account for what happened\". A spokesman for Vladimir Putin has said that an investigation will take place, but that Yevloyev had resisted arrest.\n\nIn July 2008, Human Rights Watch documented dozens of arbitrary detentions, disappearances, acts of torture, and extrajudicial executions in Ingushetia.\n\nThe Organisation for Security and Co-operation in Europe denounced Yevloyev's killing as an \"assassination\" aimed at cracking down on dissent in Ingushetia. The killing also triggered calls for Ingushetia's independence from Russia. The organizer of the protest rally, Magomed Khazibiyev, declared that the Ingush opposition would demand independence, appealing to Russia's recognition of Georgia's breakaway Abkhazia and South Ossetia as precedent.\n\nThe funeral of Yevloyev developed into an anti-government protest, in which, according to organizers, several thousands participated. Early on 2 September, police dispersed a sleeping crowd of around 50 men who remained in the main square in Nazran, Ingushetia's capital city.\n\nHis death investigation case is classified as \"Murder by negligence\" according to the Criminal Code of Russia. Another criminal case for his illegal detention (according to the investigators, police did not have the right to arrest him when they did) was opened in February 2009, but withdrawn in March 2009.\n\nOn 11 December 2009, a court in Ingushetia found Ibragim Yevloyev guilty of unintentionally murdering Magomed Yevloyev. Ibragim Yevloyev was sentenced to two years of a \"colony-settlement\". In February 2010 his sentence was mitigated to two years of freedom restriction.\n\nRelatives of Magomed Yevloyev do not trust the official version. In their view, the owner of Ingushetiya.Ru was murdered intentionally. The family addressed the European Court on Human Rights with a complaint.\n\n"}

{"id": "844215", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=844215", "title": "Mir-Hossein Mousavi", "text": "Mir-Hossein Mousavi\n\nMir-Hossein Mousavi Khameneh (, ; born 2 March 1942) is an Iranian reformist politician, artist and architect who served as the seventy-ninth and last Prime Minister of Iran from 1981 to 1989. He was a reformist candidate for the 2009 presidential election and eventually the leader of the opposition in the post-election unrest. Mousavi served as the president of the Iranian Academy of Arts until 2009, when Conservative authorities removed him.\n\nIn the early years of the revolution, Mousavi was the editor-in-chief of \"Jomhouri-e Eslami\", the official newspaper of the Islamic Republican Party, before being elevated to Minister of Foreign Affairs and eventually the post of Prime Minister. He was the last Prime Minister in Iran prior to the 1989 constitutional changes which removed the post of prime minister; he then went into semi-retirement for the next 20 years. He remains a member of the Expediency Discernment Council and the High Council of Cultural Revolution. However, he has not participated in their meetings for years, which is interpreted by political analysts and commentators as a sign of his disapproval.\n\nFor the 2009 Iranian Presidential election, Mousavi came out of semi-retirement and ran as one of two Reformist candidates against the administration of incumbent President of Iran Mahmoud Ahmadinejad. According to official results, he didn't win the election, and following alleged vote rigging and manipulation, his campaign sparked a long protest that eventually turned into a national and international movement against the Government and Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei. Despite the violent crackdown, he remains the leader of the Green Movement but his movements have remained severely restricted. He chose green as his campaign color, a color which is pervasive in Iran. He is currently under house arrest along with his wife and Mehdi Karroubi.\n\nSeyyed Mir-Hossein Mousavi was born on 2 March 1942 in Khameneh, East Azerbaijan, Iran. He is an ethnic Azerbaijani, whose family originated from Tabriz. His father, Mir-Ismail, was a tea merchant from Tabriz. Mousavi grew up in Khameneh, and moved to Tehran following his graduation from high school in 1958. Mousavi is a relative of fellow Khameneh native Ali Khamenei: Mousavi's grandmother is Khamenei's paternal aunt.\nHe earned his undergraduate degree in architecture from the National University of Tehran (now Shahid Beheshti University), and in 1969 was awarded his master's degree in architecture from the National University of Tehran, focusing primarily on traditional Iranian architecture. While a student, he was an active member of the leftist Islamic association of students. During his college years, Mousavi had a close relationship with the Freedom Movement of Iran, a religious-nationalist political party founded by Ali Shariati, whom Mousavi admired for many years. Although the party would not be invited to the post-revolution government, many future political leaders of Iran who were affiliated with the party at the time, among them Mehdi Bazargan, Yadolah Sahabi, Mahmoud Taleghani, and Mostafa Chamran would become Mousavi's closest allies. Mousavi was among the student activists who regularly attended Ali Shariati's lectures at Hosseiniyeh Ershad of Tehran, where Mousavi also exhibited his artwork under the pseudonym Hossein Rah'jo.\n\nIn 1969, Mousavi married Zahra Rahnavard, a fellow university student who specialized in sculpture, and was among the well-known students of Ali Shariati. Rahnavard later became the Chancellor of Alzahra University as well as political adviser to Iran's former President Mohammad Khatami. The couple have three daughters; all speak Azeri, Persian, English, and Arabic.\n\nMousavi and his wife had an active role in the success of the Iranian revolution. He was imprisoned for organizing street protests against the monarchy of Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi. As the Iranian revolution neared, Mousavi, whose earliest political hero was Che Guevara, became more actively involved in the struggle. He initially participated in the establishment of the Jonbesh-e Mosalmanan-e Mobarez (Movement of Militant Muslims) alongside Habibollah Peyman which eventually led him to join ranks with Mohammad Beheshti, who was a close associate of the revolution leader, Ruhollah Khomeini, and abandoned his previous connections with Ali Shariati.\nFollowing the collapse of the Shah's regime in 1979, Mousavi helped Mohammad Beheshti found the Islamic Republican Party in 1979 in order to assist the establishment of the Islamic Republic in Iran and hasten the overthrow of Iran's monarchy. He became the political secretary of the party, and chief editor of \"Jomhouri-e Eslami\", the party's official newspaper. For this, he is widely viewed as \"The Architect\" of the Islamic Republic both in Iran and abroad.\n\nIn mid-1979, he was appointed by Khomeini to the Iranian Council of Islamic revolution. As the chief editor of \"Jomhouri-e Eslami\", he was a loud critic and opponent of Abolhassan Banisadr, the first president of the Islamic Republic, until the latter's 1981 flight to France, following a successful impeachment by parliament. During Banisadr's presidency, the prime minister Mohammad Ali Rajai nominated Mousavi as his foreign minister, however Banisadr opposed the nomination and Mousavi was not appointed. On 15 August 1981, as part of the restructuring of the government in Rajai's cabinet, Mousavi was appointed foreign minister. He held the post until 15 December 1981, when he received the higher appointment of prime minister.\n\nIn August 1981, President Mohammad-Ali Rajai and Prime Minister Mohammad-Javad Bahonar were assassinated in an explosion. Ali Khamenei was then elected as the third president of Iran in the Iranian presidential election, October 1981. He put forward Ali Akbar Velayati as his prime minister, but the Iranian parliament did not give him the vote of confidence, and he was defeated with a vote of 80 to 74. Although Khamenei had strong reservations with Mousavi, as a compromise with the left-leaning parliament, agreed to offer Mousavi for the post of premier. On 28 October 1981, with the approval of Khomeini, the parliament approved Mousavi with a vote of 115 to 39 to become the 79th prime minister of Iran on 31 October 1981.\n\nThe conflicts between Mousavi, who belonged to the left wing of the Islamic Republic, with Ali Khamenei (the current leader of Iran), who belonged to the right wing of the Islamic Republic, continued during their eight years of shared governance. However, an escalation in conflicts between the two led to Mousavi's resignation shortly after the end of the Iran–Iraq War in 1988. As the prime minister, Mousavi had the full backing of Ruhollah Khomeini, the supreme leader, and he refused to accept his resignation. While his government was viewed as somewhat liberal, he was still under the pressure of hardliners, though Khomeini generally protected Mousavi from the conservatives and gave him a free rein in deciding actions for the economy. However, his involvement in security matters remained less clear, and it was disputed whether or not Mousavi was involved in the killing of thousands of dissidents and minorities in Kurdistan and Mazandaran during this time. It has generally been accepted that Mousavi and Mohsen Rezaee (who was in charge of the Revolutionary Guards during this time) have never been close, though he was in charge of foreign operations, particularly in Lebanon.\n\nMousavi's premiership coincided with the Iran–Iraq War. He guided the country through its war with Iraq, and earned popular acclaim for his stewardship of the national economy. He pioneered a bond-based economy, which many believe was responsible for a fair distribution of goods among the people throughout the Iran–Iraq War. Many analysts praise his handling of Iran's economy, his civil and economic leadership during the Iran–Iraq War, and his efforts to end Iran's international isolation. Others remember him as being \"unpredictable\" and less able to navigate Iran's labyrinthine political system than were his rivals. In 1986, Mousavi played a great role in the Iran–Contra affair and secret negotiations and dealing with USA on helping them free the American hostages in Lebanon, in return for sale of the American weapons and spare-parts that Iran's army badly needed for the Iran–Iraq War.\n\nA year after the end of the Iran–Iraq War on 20 August 1988, Ruhollah Khomeini died (June 3, 1989), and Ali Khamenei was elected as the new Supreme Leader by the Assembly of Experts. Following his death, Mousavi and his fellow left-wingers lost their main source of support within the establishment. During the parliament hearing on post-war reconstruction plans, Mousavi had heated arguments with Ali Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani, the speaker of Iran's parliament at the time, over Rafsanjani's suggestion that Iran accept the offer of western countries to help with post-war reconstruction.\n\nOn 28 July 1989, the constitution was amended and approved by Iranian voters in a national referendum with a 97% yes vote. At this time, Mehdi Karrubi had been elected as the new speaker of the parliament, to whom the amended constitution was declared. One of these amendments abolished the position of Prime Minister. Rafsanjani was elected as the fourth president of Iran on 28 July 1989, and became the president on 3 August 1989. Mousavi's premiership ended on the same date. Mousavi was not invited to be a participant in the new government headed by Rafsanjani, and disappeared from the public sphere.\n\nWhen Khomeini, the founder of the Islamic Republic, died in 1989, Mousavi was no longer welcome in the government. It was the start of 20 years of an almost total absence from public life for Mousavi, which many considered as a sign of his disapproval of the established government, though he did sit on two high-level government councils.\n\nIn 1989, Ali Khamenei named him as a member of the Expediency Discernment Council, his membership of which still continues. Mousavi has been a member of the Supreme Council of Cultural Revolution since 1996. He was also the political adviser of president Hashemi Rafsanjani (1989–1997) and senior adviser of president Khatami (1997–2005).\n\nDuring these years, he partly retired from politics and returned to architecture and teaching, becoming President of the Iranian Academy of Arts, one of the four academies of the Islamic Republic of Iran. The main building of the Academy is designed by him. At the same time, he developed his passion for painting and writing poetry. He was a professor at Shahid Beheshti University and later joined the Academic staff of Tarbiat Modares University. His main field is architecture, and buildings such as \"Kanoon-e Tohid\" in Tehran, \"Beynolharamein Bazaar\" in Shiraz, \"Haft-e-tir Martyr's tomb\" in Tehran's Behesht-e Zahra, and \"Salman mosque\" in the presidential residence are examples of his work. In recent years, he has been more active in painting and has participated in many exhibitions.\n\nMousavi refused to run for the presidency in the 1997 elections, which caused the reformists to turn to his former Cabinet Minister, then a little-known cleric, Mohammad Khatami, who was elected by a landslide. During Khatami's administration, Mousavi served as the Senior Adviser to the President.\n\nMousavi was considered the leading candidate from the reformist alliance to run in the Iranian presidential election, 2005. However, on 12 October 2004, he officially declined the proposal after a meeting with President Mohammad Khatami and the two other top members of one of Iran's main Reformist parties, the Association of Combatant Clerics, Mehdi Karroubi and Mohammad Mousavi-Khoiniha.\n\nAfter 20 years of political silence, on 9 March 2009, Mousavi announced his intention to run in the 2009 Iranian presidential election. He stated that his main goals were: to institutionalize social justice, equality and fairness, freedom of expression, to root out corruption and to speed up Iran's stagnant process of privatization, and thus move Iran away from what he called \"an alms-based economy\". Mousavi criticized the then-current conservative President, Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, for his alleged economic mismanagement, asking, when Iran \"was making profits from the high prices of oil, did he (Ahmadinejad) envisage a situation when the prices would fall?\" On 16 March 2009, the former Iranian President Khatami withdrew from the election in support of Mir-Hossein Mousavi.\n\nMousavi ran as an independent Principled Reformist candidate. Although he is one of the original founders of the Iranian reformist camp, he shares many principles of the conservatives. Many reformist parties, among them reformist Islamic Iranian Participation Front, whose main candidate was Khatami, have supported his candidacy after the latter withdrew from the race. Many supporters of the reformist movement, however, objected to Mousavi's candidacy on the grounds that he was not committed to the principles of the reformist parties. Although Mousavi stated that he was not running as a reformist, he indicated that he welcomed the support of different parties, both reformist and conservative. He started his campaign from the center of Iranian politics; over time, he shifted more towards the left by declaring his support for reforms. Although some active members of the conservative camp, such as Emad Afroogh, as well as the conservative newspaper \"Jomhouri-e Eslami\", supported Mousavi's candidacy, he did not receive the official backing of any major conservative party. His candidacy made it harder for the conservatives to support Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, and large conservative parties, such as the Combatant Clergy Association, did not back the current President for a second term of office.\n\nMousavi had on numerous occasions indicated his wish to change the constitution in order to remove the existing ban on the private ownership of television stations (currently all Iranian television stations are state-owned), as well as transfer the control of the law-enforcement forces to the President (so that they represent the people, since the people directly elect the President through popular vote) from the Supreme Leader. He said that \"the issue of non-compliance with the Iranian rules and regulations is the biggest problem that the country is currently faced with\" and that he wished to put in place ways to enforce the laws further, and that it was also important to bring an end to keeping the populace uninformed about government matters. Among his policies were creation of a free environment for the flow of information and corrections to the national budget. He wanted to promote the creation of private, non-governmental TV networks and stop the operation of the \"Moral Police\". He has spoken about his opposition to massive changes in ministries, which he claims is what Ahmadinejad has done.\n\nThe BBC reported that Mousavi \"called for greater personal freedoms in Iran and criticized the ban on private television channels\", but \"refused to back down from the country's disputed nuclear programme, saying it was \"for peaceful purposes\". Regarding the Iranian nuclear program, his plan includes a reduction of the cost by opposing radical approaches while maintaining what he sees as \"Iran's right to civilian nuclear technology\". Mousavi has stated that giving up the country's nuclear program would be \"irreparable\" and that the Iranian people support the nuclear program. \"No one in Iran will accept suspension,\" Mousavi has said, adding that if elected, his policy would be to work to provide \"guarantees\" that Tehran's nuclear activities would never divert to non-peaceful aims.\n\nOn 30 May, Mousavi pledged that if elected he would amend \"discriminatory and unjust regulations\" against women, and take other measures in favour of women's rights and equality. He said that he would seek to disband the so-called morality police force, and ensure that Iranian women are treated equally, with the ability to attain financial empowerment and to serve at the highest levels of decision making bodies.\n\nMousavi directly addressed activating foreign policy to boost national interest by reducing tensions with other nations. This included negotiating with U.S. President Barack Obama if \"his actions are in keeping with his words\". He condemned Ahmadinejad's attitude toward The Holocaust (namely, that it was \"a myth\"), and condemned the killing of Jews in the Holocaust.\n\nThe election was held on 12 June 2009. The official results showed Ahmadinejad winning by a landslide, though Mousavi and many others believed the results to be fraudulent, suggesting that the Interior Minister, Sadegh Mahsouli, an ally of Ahmadinejad, interfered with the election and distorted the votes to keep Ahmadinejad in power. Mousavi has claimed victory, and called for his supporters to celebrate it, sparking large protests as a result.\n\nDue to protests, from the opposition, the Supreme Leader ordered a partial recount of the election results. The recount was a random counting of 10% of the ballots. In order to create transparency, a 12-member council showed the recount on television, and concluded that President Ahmadinejad still led Mousavi after the recount. After the recount, the Guardian council certified the election, and concluded no evidence of irregularities, and closed the dossier on the election.\n\nThe Iranian Green Movement refers to a series of actions after the Iranian presidential election, 2009, in which protesters demanded the removal of Mahmoud Ahmadinejad from office.\n\nMir Hossein Mousavi, Mehdi Karroubi, Hossein-Ali Montazeri and Mohammad Khatami are recognized as leaders of the Green Movement. Where is my vote? () was a motto used during the protests. Anti-Ahmadinejad protesters chanted the English-language phrase in numbers not seen since the 1979 Iranian Revolution, in an attempt to receive international attention. The Iranian Government had released results claiming a two-thirds majority for Ahmadinejad, but supporters of Mousavi and Karroubi, the moderate opposition leaders, accused the government of rigging the vote.\n\nIn the aftermath of the election and ensuing comments by Ahmadinejad and other conservative leaders, calling the opposition \"a pile of dust\" (خس و خاشاک), protests were widened and massive peaceful protests were held around the country. Although the Iranian government prohibited any gatherings of protesters in Tehran and across the country, significantly slowed down internet access and censored any form of media supporting the opposition, hundreds of thousands of Iranians marched in defiance. Large numbers of protesters were arrested, and several were killed by the police and militia forces Basij. Neda Agha-soltan and Sohrab Aarabi were among the victims, and alleged cases of rape in prison (Taraneh Mousavi) were also uncovered.\n\nSince the election, the government has severely restricted the access of foreign and Iranian media to footage and information relating to opposition activities. As a result, scenes of the massive street protests and more frequent student protests have been filmed by participants themselves.\n\nSeyed Ali Mousavi was the nephew of Mousavi. Ali Mousavi died on 27 December 2009, during the 2009 Iranian election protests, when he was reportedly shot in either the back or the chest by security forces during demonstrations against Mahmoud Ahmadinejad's contested election win.\n\nIranian filmmaker Mohsen Makhmalbaf, the official spokesman of Mir-Hossein Moussavi's campaign abroad, told BBC News in an interview that Iranian secret police had called Seyed Ali Mousavi several times, days before he was shot, saying: \"We will kill you.\"\n\nAfter he died, his body was taken to Ebn-e Sina hospital, where protesters demonstrated outside. The protesters were broken up with tear gas by the Iranian security forces. It was later revealed that the government had removed his body and taken it to an undisclosed location in an attempt to crack down on the protests.\n\nMousavi and other reformist leaders are now working with peaceful and legal methods to widen the influence of their reforms. They have set up a new coalition, named The Green Path of Hope. Iranian political parties and movements need to be authorized by the Interior Ministry. Mousavi neither recognizes the current government as legitimate, nor is likely to receive permission; the movement was named a \"path\" in order bypass this law.\n\nThe Green Path of Hope seeks to continue protests against Ahmadinejad's presidency following lawful and peaceful methods, and the full execution of the constitution, as Mousavi says:\n\nMousavi is quoted in describing the movement:\n\nAccording to organization officials, the movement encompasses numerous political parties, NGOs and social networks. Mousavi emphasized that existent, autonomous social networks in the community are part of this movement:\n\nThe \"Green Path\" has six main members on its central council, who are connected to reformist parties, NGOs, and social networks. The main body will be ordinary protesters. The strategy is to connect existent pressures and issues in society in a social network, and to therefore lead protests in a lawful manner.\n\nIn the wake of the Tunisian and Egyptian revolutions, Green movement leaders in Iran called for demonstrations on 14 February 2011. The government responded by placing leaders of the movement under house arrest, and on 14 February Iranian state TV broadcast images of \"some 50 conservative MPs marching through parliament's main hall\" chanting \"Death to Mousavi, death to Karroubi\".\n\nMousavi and his wife, as well as Mehdi Karoubi, another opposition figure, were put under house arrest after they urged their supporters to organize demonstrations in support of uprisings in the Arab world in February 2011. On 2 February 2013, Iran's security forces arrested Mousavi's two daughters, Zahra and Nargess Mousavi, in their home. The semi-official news agency ILNA reported that they were questioned, and then freed the same day. After the election of Hassan Rouhani as President in 2013, it was announced that Mousavi and Rahnavard would soon be freed from house arrest. However, this had not occurred as of 2018.\n\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "10435472", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=10435472", "title": "Muhannad (jihadist)", "text": "Muhannad (jihadist)\n\nMelfi Al Hussaini Al Harbi, more commonly known as Muhannad (مهند; Mukhannad or Mukhanad, ), and also known as Abu Anas (ابو أنس), was a Mujahid Emir (commander) fighting in Chechnya. Following the death of Abu Hafs al-Urduni on 26 November 2006, he was named leader of the Arab Mujahideen in Chechnya, the battalion of foreign fighters once commanded by the notorious Saudi-born Ibn al-Khattab.\n\nAlthough Russian intelligence has claimed that he was a native of Jordan who served as a combat pilot (achieving the rank of Lieutenant) in the Jordanian Air Force and who also underwent military training in the United States they are not considered true. He is not Jordanian, it is reported in other sources that he was Saudi. He was killed by Russian security forces outside the village of Serzhen-Yurt, Chechnya on 21 April 2011.\n\nAlthough little is reliably known of Muhannad’s early life, he was born in 1969 and hailed from the Medina area of Saudi Arabia’s western Hejaz region. It is said that he have graduated with honors from the Islamic University of Madinah and is believed to have descended from Al Ashraf, meaning “from the family of the Prophet.”\n\nMuhannad arrived in the Caucasus in 1999 during the early days of the Second Chechen War, attempting to pass through Georgia into Chechnya. Upon arrival in the Pankisi Gorge – a mountainous valley in northeastern Georgia inhabited mostly by ethnic Chechens known as Kists – Muhannad waited almost two years for his opportunity to cross the border. During his time living amongst the Chechen refugees, Muhannad gave lectures on the history of Islam and advocated a “purer” form of the religion than that traditionally practiced by Chechens; it is perhaps no coincidence that Wahabbi influence began to appear in Pankisi around this same time.\nMuhannad was eventually able to gain entry into Chechnya with a group controlled by the Akhmadov brothers in 2001, arriving along with other prominent Arab fighters such as Abu Atiya, Abu Rabia, and others. Having acquired previous battlefield experience in Afghanistan,The Philippines, Bosnia, and Kosovo, Muhannad joined the battalion of Arab Mujahideen in Chechnya led by Khattab. \nIn October 2006, Chechen Republic of Ichkeria president Dokka Umarov made Muhannad one of three deputies to Magomet 'Magas' Yevloyev, the Ingush commander of the separatist military wing then known as the Caucasian Front. The following month, Abu Hafs al-Urduni - the successor to Abu al-Walid (killed in 2004) and Khattab (killed in 2002) as commander of the Arab Mujahideen in Chechnya - was killed by Russian forces in Dagestan, leading to Muhannad's unanimous appointment as the new Emir on 9 December 2006. It is likely that in this same time period, he became the key facilitator connecting Chechen separatists to financial supporters in the Middle East.\n\nFollowing Umarov's declaration of a North Caucasus-wide insurgent organization called the Caucasus Emirate in September 2007, Muhannad was declared his naib, or deputy. In the meantime, Muhannad was also a ranking member of the rebel unit commanded by Aslambek Vadalov, and his participation in combat operations put him on equal footing with his indigenous counterparts, garnering him much respect.\n\nIn February 2008, he was reportedly killed by officers of the Russian Ministry of Internal Affairs (MVD) during a search operation near the village of Arshty in Ingushetia. Interfax, however, refuted Muhannad's death the same day, saying it was a different militant. Dokka Umarov later appeared on video with Muhannad to refute statements of his death, calling them lies and propaganda.\n\nAccording to different sources, Muhannad took part in attacks on Russian security forces in eastern Chechnya in 2008 and in western Chechnya along the border with Ingushetia in 2009. In January 2009, he issued a statement declaring the Caucasus Emirate's support for the Palestinians in Gaza who at that time were under siege by the Israeli military; when he followed that with a declaration on 6 April appointing Umalat Magomedov (also known as al-Bara) to the role of Emir of the Dagestan Front, it suggested that Muhannad had a larger profile within the Caucasus Emirate than most believed a foreign fighter could attain, and that he had the legitimate ability to influence decisions made by Umarov.\n\nOn 29 August 2010, Muhannad was one of two commanders who led an assault on the village of Tsentoroy, birthplace of Chechen President Ramzan Kadyrov. The audacious operation was ultimately defeated after several hours of heavy fighting that resulted in the deaths of twelve militants and five security officers.\n\nOn 1 August 2010, the rebel website Kavkaz Center posted an announcement from Dokka Umarov in which he stated he was stepping down from the top leadership position in the Caucasus Emirate and naming Aslambek Vadalov as his replacement. However, just three days later Umarov would retract his resignation, leading to confusion over who was actually in control of the North Caucasus insurgency. On 12 August, a video posted on a Russian militant website appeared featuring Muhannad, Khuseyn Gakayev, Vadalov, and Tarkhan Gaziev; in it, the four veteran field commanders alleged that Umarov's renunciation was disrespectful to his subordinates, and while they still pledged allegiance to the Caucasus Emirate, they no longer supported him. According to Muhannad, the primary reason for the mutiny was Umarov's disobedience of the mujahideen shura council's consensus that he step down; in response, Saifullah Gubdenski - leader of the Dagestani fighters - fiercely condemned Muhannad by accusing him and his foreign predecessors of \"neglecting the aspirations of local rebel leaders\" and lashing out at the \"outsiders' selfish desire to install their men in leading positions in traditionally parochial\" Caucasian militant groups. Furthermore, the vast majority of insurgents in the republics surrounding Chechnya continued to support Umarov, at one point reaching out for external theological support via the London-based Syrian Salafi ideologue named Abd al-Mun'im Mustafa Halima (also known as Abu Basir al-Tartusi), who called on Muhannad to \"either repent and obey Emir Doku Abu Osman (Dokka Umarov) or leave the [North] Caucasus and return home.\" Umarov himself accused Muhannad of being the \"main organizer of fitna (split/discord) among the Mujahideen\" in Chechnya, \nand asked him to re-affirm his loyalty. When Muhannad did not, Umarov allegedly relieved him of his command, leading to a very significant break within militant ranks.\n\nMuhannad was killed on 21 April 2011 in a search and destroy operation carried out in forested, mountainous terrain east of the village of Serzhen-Yurt at the junction of three districts in the Chechen republic: Shali, Kurchaloi, and Vedeno. According to the press center of the Chechen Interior Ministry, the operation featured officers from several district police stations, a Spetsnaz battalion of Russian MVD “South” troops, Spetsnaz from the 2nd Patrol Regiment of the Chechen MVD, and a detachment of the “Terek” unit from the MVD of the North Caucasus Federal District (SKFO). The search team allegedly happened upon a group of six militants at 11:50 AM, who promptly split into groups of \"two or three\" so as to avoid capture. According to Russian officials, Muhannad and an Ingush militant named Ilez Sultygov ran into an ambush set by a group of commandos, and were killed in the ensuing shootout. Russian television showed footage of Muhannad's body on 22 April 2011, a common practice by Russian authorities following the successful liquidation of militant commanders.\n\nFollowing his death, Russian authorities stated that Muhannad was \"directly involved in virtually every suicide terrorist attack committed in the Russian Federation over the past few years,\" at least according to intelligence gathered from captured Chechen militants. Ramzan Kadyrov also claimed that Muhannad only weighed around 50 kilograms at the time of his death, using this as proof that the insurgency was having \"serious difficulties with the supply of food\" and was \"on the verge of starvation.\" Kadyrov, however, is known for outrageous and unverifiable claims, making it worth noting that in the photograph released of Muhannad's corpse he does not appear to be much different physically than those taken over the past decade.\n\nMuhannad's top deputy and presumed successor - an ethnic Kurd from Turkey called Abdulla Kurd - would be killed less than two weeks later, capping a momentous month for the Russian security services that included the elimination of several high-ranking Emirs in other provinces, including Supyan Abdullayev (Deputy Emir of the Caucasus Emirate), Israpil Velijanov (Emir of Vilayat Dagestan), Asker Dzhappuyev (Emir of the United Vilayat of Kabarda, Balkaria and Karachay) and several other field commanders and lesser known Emirs of smaller sectors. Muhannad's killing was of significant importance given that he was one of the most ruthless, capable and tactically proficient field commanders as well as the last prominent Arab volunteer in Chechnya; analysts called it one of Russia's most significant security successes in the region in years.\n\nA July 2011 rapprochement by the feuding separatist factions re-aligned Gakayev, Vadalov, and numerous other field commanders who had previously forsworn their oaths of loyalty to Umarov; Muhannad's death is thought to have paved the way to reconciliation between the two sides.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "53257", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=53257", "title": "Olivia Newton-John", "text": "Olivia Newton-John\n\nOlivia Newton-John, (born 26 September 1948) is an English-Australian singer, songwriter, actress, entrepreneur, and activist. She is a four-time Grammy award winner who has amassed five number-one and ten other top ten \"Billboard\" Hot 100 singles, and two number-one \"Billboard\" 200 solo albums. Eleven of her singles (including two platinum) and 14 of her albums (including two platinum and four double platinum) have been certified gold by the RIAA. She has sold an estimated 100 million records worldwide, making her one of the world's best-selling artists of all time. She starred in the musical film \"Grease\", and is one of the most successful in history, with the single \"You're the One That I Want\", with John Travolta, one of the best selling singles.\n\nNewton-John has been a long-time activist for environmental and animal rights issues. She has been an advocate for health awareness, becoming involved with various charities, health products, and fundraising efforts. Her business interests have included launching several product lines for Koala Blue and co-owning the Gaia Retreat & Spa in Australia.\n\nNewton-John has been married twice. She is the mother of one daughter, Chloe Rose Lattanzi, with her first husband, actor Matt Lattanzi. She married John Easterling in 2008.\n\nNewton-John was born in Cambridge, England, to Welshman Brinley \"Bryn\" Newton-John (1914–1992) and Irene Helene (née Born) (1914–2003). Her Jewish maternal grandfather, Nobel Prize-winning physicist Max Born, fled with his family to England from Germany before World War II to escape the Nazi regime. Newton-John's maternal grandmother was of paternal Jewish ancestry as well. She is a third cousin of comedian Ben Elton. Her maternal great-grandfather was jurist Victor Ehrenberg and her matrilineal great-grandmother's father was jurist Rudolf von Jhering.\n\nNewton-John's father was an MI5 officer on the Enigma project at Bletchley Park who took Rudolf Hess into custody during World War II. After the war he became Headmaster at Cambridgeshire High School for Boys and was in that role when Olivia was born.\n\nNewton-John is the youngest of three children, following brother Hugh, a doctor, and sister Rona (1943–2013) (an actress who was married to \"Grease\" co-star Jeff Conaway from 1980 until their divorce in 1985). In 1954, when Olivia was six, the Newton-Johns emigrated to Melbourne, Australia, where her father worked as a professor of German and as Master of Ormond College at the University of Melbourne.\n\nShe attended Christ Church Grammar School, and then University High School, near to Ormond College. At 14, Newton-John formed a short-lived all-girl group, Sol Four, with three classmates often performing in a coffee shop owned by her brother-in-law. She became a regular on local Australian radio and television shows including HSV-7's \"The Happy Show\" where she performed as \"Lovely Livvy\".\n\nShe also appeared on \"The Go!! Show\" where she met future duet partner, singer Pat Carroll, and future music producer, John Farrar (Carroll and Farrar would later marry). She entered and won a talent contest on the television program \"Sing, Sing, Sing,\" hosted by 1960s Australian icon Johnny O'Keefe, performing the songs \"Anyone Who Had a Heart\" and \"Everything's Coming Up Roses\". She was initially reluctant to use the prize she had won, a trip to Great Britain, but traveled there nearly a year later after her mother encouraged her to broaden her horizons.\n\nNewton-John recorded her first single, \"Till You Say You'll Be Mine\", in Britain for Decca Records in 1966. While in Britain, Newton-John missed her then-boyfriend, Ian Turpie, with whom she had co-starred in the Australian telefilm, \"Funny Things Happen Down Under\". She repeatedly booked trips back to Australia which her mother would subsequently cancel.\n\nNewton-John's outlook changed when Pat Carroll moved to the UK. The two formed a duo called \"Pat and Olivia\" and toured nightclubs in Europe. (In one incident, they were booked at Paul Raymond's Revue in Soho, London. Dressed primly in frilly, high-collared dresses, they were unaware that this was a strip club until they began to perform onstage.) After Carroll's visa expired forcing her to return to Australia, Newton-John remained in Britain to pursue solo work until 1975.\n\nNewton-John was recruited for the group Toomorrow formed by American producer Don Kirshner. In 1970, the group starred in a \"science fiction musical\" film and recorded an accompanying soundtrack album, on RCA records, both named after the group. That same year the group made two single recordings, \"You're My Baby Now/Goin' Back\" and \"I Could Never Live Without Your Love/Roll Like A River\". Neither track became a chart success and the project failed with the group disbanding.\n\nNewton-John released her first solo album, \"If Not For You\" (US No. 158 Pop), in 1971. The title track, written by Bob Dylan and previously recorded by former Beatle George Harrison for his 1970 album \"All Things Must Pass\", was her first international hit (US No. 25 Pop, No. 1 Adult Contemporary (\"AC\"). Her follow-up single, \"Banks of the Ohio\", was a top 10 hit in the UK and Australia. She was voted Best British Female Vocalist two years in a row by the magazine \"Record Mirror\". She made frequent appearances on Cliff Richard's weekly show, \"It's Cliff Richard\", and starred with him in the telefilm \"The Case\".\n\nIn the United States, Newton-John's career floundered after \"If Not For You\". Subsequent singles including \"Banks of the Ohio\" (No. 94 Pop, No. 34 AC) and remakes of George Harrison's \"What Is Life\" (No. 34 AC) and John Denver's \"Take Me Home, Country Roads\" (No. 119 Pop) made minimal chart impact until the release of \"Let Me Be There\" in 1973. The song reached the American Top 10 on the Pop (No. 6), Country (No. 7), and AC (No. 3) charts and earned her a Grammy for Best Country Female and an Academy of Country Music award for Most Promising Female Vocalist.\n\nIn 1974, Newton-John represented the United Kingdom in the Eurovision Song Contest with the song \"Long Live Love\". The song was chosen for Newton-John by the British public out of six possible entries. (Newton-John later admitted that she disliked the song.) Newton-John finished fourth at the contest held in Brighton behind ABBA's winning Swedish entry, \"Waterloo\". All six Eurovision contest song candidates were recorded by Newton-John and included on her \"Long Live Love\" album, her first for the EMI Records label.\n\nThe \"Long Live Love\" album was released in the US as \"If You Love Me, Let Me Know\" with the six Eurovision songs dropped for four different, more country-oriented tracks intended to capitalise on the success of \"Let Me Be There\". The title track was the first single reaching No. 5 Pop, No. 2 Country (her best country position to date) and No. 2 AC. The next single, \"I Honestly Love You\", became Newton-John's signature song. Written and composed by Jeff Barry and Peter Allen, the ballad became her first number-one Pop (two weeks), second number-one AC (three weeks) and third Top 10 Country (No. 6) hit and earned Newton-John two more Grammys for Record of the Year and Best Pop Vocal Performance-Female. The success of both singles helped the album reach No. 1 on both the Pop (one week) and Country (eight weeks) Albums charts.\n\nNewton-John's country success sparked a debate among purists, who took issue with a foreigner singing country-flavoured pop music being equated with native Nashville artists. In addition to her Grammy for \"Let Me Be There\", Newton-John was also named the Country Music Association Female Vocalist of the Year in 1974, defeating more established Nashville-based nominees Loretta Lynn, Dolly Parton and Tanya Tucker, as well as Canadian artist Anne Murray.\n\nThis protest, in part, led to the formation of the short-lived Association of Country Entertainers (ACE). Newton-John was eventually supported by the country music community. Stella Parton, Dolly's sister, recorded \"Ode to Olivia\" and Newton-John recorded her 1976 album, \"Don't Stop Believin'\", in Nashville.\n\nEncouraged by expatriate Australian singer Helen Reddy, Newton-John left the UK and moved to the US. Newton-John topped the Pop (one week) and Country (six weeks) Albums charts with her next album, \"Have You Never Been Mellow.\" The album generated two singles – the John Farrar-penned title track (No. 1 Pop, No. 3 Country, No. 1 AC) and \"Please Mr. Please\" (No. 3 Pop, No. 5 Country, No. 1 AC). However, her pop career cooled with the release of her next album, \"Clearly Love.\" Her streak of five consecutive gold Top 10 singles on the \"Billboard\" Hot 100 ended when the album's first single, \"Something Better to Do\", stopped at No. 13 (also No. 19 Country and No. 1 AC). Although her albums still achieved gold status, she did not return to the Top 10 on the Hot 100 or \"Billboard\" 200 charts again until 1978.\n\nNewton-John's singles continued to easily top the AC chart, where she ultimately amassed ten No. 1 singles including a record seven consecutively:\n\nShe provided a prominent, but uncredited, vocal on John Denver's \"Fly Away\" single which was succeeded by her own single, \"Let It Shine\"/\"He Ain't Heavy, He's My Brother\", at No. 1 on the AC chart. (\"Fly Away\" returned to No. 1 after the two-week reign of \"Let It Shine\".) Newton-John also continued to reach the Country Top 10 where she tallied seven Top 10 singles through 1976's \"Come on Over\" (No. 23 Pop, No. 5 Country, No. 1 AC) and six consecutive (of a career nine total) Top 10 albums through 1976's \"Don't Stop Believin'\" (No. 30 Pop, No. 7 Country). She headlined her first US television special, \"A Special Olivia Newton-John,\" in November 1976.\n\nBy mid-1977, Newton-John's AC and country success also began to wane. Her \"Making a Good Thing Better\" album (No. 34 Pop, No. 13 Country) failed to be certified gold, and its only single, the title track (No. 87 Pop, No. 20 AC), did not reach even the AC Top 10 or the Country chart. Later that year, \"Olivia Newton-John's Greatest Hits\" (No. 13 Pop, No. 7 Country) became her first platinum album.\n\nIn 1979, Newton-John received the Officer of the Order of the British Empire (OBE) medal from Queen Elizabeth at Buckingham Palace in London.\n\nNewton-John's career soared after she starred in the film adaptation of the Broadway musical \"Grease\" in 1978. She was offered the lead role of Sandy after meeting producer Allan Carr at a dinner party at Helen Reddy's home. Burned by her \"Toomorrow\" experience and concerned that she was too old to play a high school senior (she turned 29 during \"Grease\"s 1977 filming), Newton-John insisted on a screen test with the film's co-star, John Travolta. The film accommodated Newton-John's Australian accent by recasting her character from the play's original American Sandy Dumbrowski to Sandy Olsson, an Australian who holidays and then moves with her family to the U.S. Newton-John previewed some of the film's soundtrack during her second American network television special, \"Olivia\", featuring guests ABBA and Andy Gibb.\n\n\"Grease\" became the biggest box-office hit of 1978. spent 12 non-consecutive weeks at No. 1 and yielded three Top 5 singles for Newton-John: the platinum \"You're The One That I Want\" (No. 1 Pop, No. 23 AC) with John Travolta, the gold \"Hopelessly Devoted to You\" (No. 3 Pop, No. 20 Country, No. 7 AC) and the gold \"Summer Nights\" (No. 5 Pop, No. 21 AC) with John Travolta and the film's cast. The former two songs were written and composed by her long-time music producer, John Farrar, specifically for the film. (\"Summer Nights\" was from the original play written by Jim Jacobs and Warren Casey.)\n\nNewton-John became the second woman (after Linda Ronstadt in 1977) to have two singles – \"Hopelessly Devoted to You\" and \"Summer Nights\" – in the \"Billboard\" Top 5 simultaneously. Newton-John's performance earned her a People's Choice Award for Favorite Film Actress. She was nominated for a Golden Globe as Best Actress in a Musical and performed the Oscar-nominated \"Hopelessly Devoted to You\" at the 1979 Academy Awards.\n\nThe film's popularity has endured through the years. It was re-released for its 20th anniversary in 1998 and ranked as the second highest-grossing film behind \"Titanic\" in its opening weekend. It was most recently re-released in July 2010 as a sing-along version in select American theaters. The soundtrack is one of the top ten best-selling soundtracks of all time.\n\nIn June 2006, Newton-John's company ON-J Productions Ltd filed a lawsuit against Universal Music Group (UMG) for $1 million in unpaid royalties from the \"Grease\" soundtrack. In 2007, it was announced that she and UMG had reached a \"conditional settlement\".\n\nNewton-John's transformation in \"Grease\" from goody-goody \"Sandy 1\" to spandex-clad \"Sandy 2\" emboldened Newton-John to do the same with her music career. In November 1978, she released her next studio album, \"Totally Hot\", which became her first solo Top 10 (No. 7) album since \"Have You Never Been Mellow\". Dressed on the cover all in leather, the album's singles \"A Little More Love\" (No. 3 Pop, No. 94 Country, No. 4 AC), \"Deeper Than the Night\" (No. 11 Pop, No. 87 Country, No. 4 AC), and the title track (No. 52 Pop) all demonstrated a more aggressive and uptempo sound for Newton-John. Although the album de-emphasised country, it still reached No. 4 on the Country Albums chart. Newton-John released the B-side, \"Dancin' 'Round and 'Round\", of the \"Totally Hot\" single to Country radio peaking at No. 29 (as well as No. 82 Pop and No. 25 AC), becoming her last charted solo Country airplay single to date.\n\nNewton-John began 1980 by releasing \"I Can't Help It\" (No. 12 Pop, No. 8 AC), a duet with Andy Gibb from his \"After Dark\" album, and by starring in her third television special, \"Hollywood Nights.\" Later that year, she appeared in her first film since \"Grease\" starring in the musical \"Xanadu\" with Gene Kelly and Michael Beck. Although the film was a critical failure, its soundtrack (No. 4 Pop) was certified double platinum boasting five Top 20 singles on the \"Billboard\" Hot 100. Newton-John charted with \"Magic\" (No. 1 Pop, No. 1 AC), \"Suddenly\" with Cliff Richard (No. 20 Pop, No. 4 AC) and the title song with the Electric Light Orchestra (No. 8 Pop, No. 2 AC). (ELO also charted with \"I'm Alive\" (No. 16 Pop, No. 48 AC) and \"All Over the World\" (No. 13 Pop, No. 46 AC).)\n\n\"Magic\" was Newton-John's biggest Pop hit to that point (four weeks at No. 1) and still ranks as the biggest AC hit of her career (five weeks at No. 1). The film has since become a cult classic and the basis for a Broadway show that ran for more than 500 performances beginning in 2007 and was nominated for four Tony Awards including Best Musical. (A successful international tour of the show followed.)\n\nIn 1981, Newton-John released her most successful studio album, the double platinum \"Physical\". The title track, written by Steve Kipner and Terry Shaddick, spent ten weeks atop the \"Billboard\" Hot 100, matching the record at that time for most weeks spent at No. 1 in the rock era held by Debby Boone's \"You Light Up My Life\". The single was certified platinum and it ultimately ranked as the biggest song of the decade. (In 2008, \"Billboard\" ranked the song No. 6 among all songs that charted in the 50-year history of the Hot 100.)\n\n\"Physical\" earned Newton-John her only placement ever on the R&B Singles (No. 28) and Albums (No. 32) chart. The \"Physical\" album spawned two more singles, \"Make a Move on Me\" (No. 5 Pop, No. 6 AC) and \"Landslide\" (No. 52 Pop).\n\nThe provocative lyrics of the \"Physical\" title track prompted two Utah radio stations to ban the single from their playlists. (In 2010, \"Billboard\" magazine ranked this as the most popular single ever about sex.) To counter its overtly suggestive tone, Newton-John filmed an exercise-themed video that turned the song into an aerobics anthem and made headbands a fashion accessory outside the gym.\n\nShe pioneered the nascent music video industry by recording a video album for \"Physical\" featuring videos of all the album's tracks and three of her older hits. The video album earned her a fourth Grammy and was aired as an ABC prime-time special, \"Let's Get Physical,\" becoming a Top 10 Nielsen hit. The success of \"Physical\" led to an international tour and the release of her second hits collection, the double platinum \"Olivia's Greatest Hits Vol. 2\" (No. 16 Pop), which yielded two more Top 40 singles: \"Heart Attack\" (No. 3 Pop) and \"Tied Up\" (No. 38 Pop). The tour was filmed for her \"Olivia in Concert\" television special which premiered on HBO in January 1983. The special was subsequently released to video earning Newton-John another Grammy nomination.\n\nNewton-John re-teamed with Travolta in 1983 for the critically and commercially unsuccessful \"Two of a Kind,\" redeemed by its platinum soundtrack (No. 26 Pop) featuring \"Twist of Fate\" (No. 5 Pop), \"Livin' in Desperate Times\" (No. 31 Pop), and a new duet with Travolta, \"Take a Chance\" (No. 3 AC). Newton-John released another video package, the Grammy-nominated \"Twist of Fate,\" featuring videos of her four songs on the \"Two of a Kind\" soundtrack and the two new singles from \"Olivia's Greatest Hits Vol. 2\".\n\nThat same year Newton-John and Pat Carroll founded \"Koala Blue.\" The store, originally for Australian imports, evolved into a chain of women's clothing boutiques. The chain was initially successful, but it eventually declared bankruptcy and closed in 1992. Newton-John and Farrar would later license the brand name for a line of Australian produced wines, confections, and bed/bath products.\n\nNewton-John married her long-time boyfriend, actor Matt Lattanzi, in December 1984; they divorced in 1995. The couple had met four years earlier while filming \"Xanadu\". Their daughter, Chloe Rose, was born in January 1986.\n\nNewton-John, a Carlton Football Club fan, performed the Australian national anthem at the 1986 VFL Grand Final between Carlton and Hawthorn\n\nNewton-John's music career cooled again with the release of her next studio album, the gold \"Soul Kiss\" (No. 29 Pop), in 1985. The album's only charted single was the title track (No. 20 Pop, No. 20 AC). Due to her pregnancy, Newton-John limited her publicity for the album. The video album for \"Soul Kiss\" featured only five of the album's ten tracks (concept videos for the album's singles \"Soul Kiss\" and \"Toughen Up\" as well as performance videos of the tracks \"Culture Shock\", \"Emotional Tangle\" and \"The Right Moment\").\n\nAfter a nearly three-year hiatus following the birth of Chloe, Newton-John resumed her recording career with the 1988 album, \"The Rumour.\" The album was promoted by an HBO special, \"Olivia Down Under\", and its first single, the title track, was written and produced by Elton John. Both the single (No. 62 Pop, No. 33 AC) and the album (No. 67 Pop) fizzled as the nearly 40-year-old Newton-John seemed \"old\" when compared with the teen queens Debbie Gibson and Tiffany ruling the Pop charts at that time. (Ironically, this album was praised by critics as more mature with Newton-John addressing topics such as AIDS, the environment and single-parent households).\n\nThe second single, \"Can't We Talk It Over in Bed\", did not chart, but was released in 1989 by Grayson Hugh, the song's arranger, as \"Talk It Over\" becoming a Top 20 Pop hit. A year later, Newton-John recorded her self-described \"self-indulgent\" album, \"Warm and Tender.\" Inspired by her daughter, who appeared on the album cover, the album featured lullabies and love songs for parents and their children. This album, the last one produced by John Farrar, also failed to revive her recording career struggling to No. 124 Pop.\n\nNewton-John was primed for another comeback in 1992 when she compiled her third hits collection, \"Back to Basics – The Essential Collection 1971–1992\", and planned her first tour since her \"Physical\" trek ten years earlier. Shortly after the album's release, Newton-John was diagnosed with breast cancer forcing her to cancel all publicity for the album including the tour. (Newton-John received her diagnosis the same weekend her father died.) Newton-John recovered and has since become an advocate for breast cancer research and other health issues. She is a product spokesperson for the Liv-Kit, a breast self-examination product. She is also partial owner of the Gaia Retreat and Spa in Byron Bay, New South Wales.\n\nNewton-John's advocacy for health issues was presaged by her prior involvement with many humanitarian causes. Newton-John cancelled a 1978 concert tour of Japan to protest the slaughter of dolphins caught in tuna fishing nets. She subsequently rescheduled the tour when the Japanese government assured her the matter was being addressed.\n\nShe was a performer on the 1979 \"Music for UNICEF Concert\" for the UN' International Year of the Child televised worldwide. During the concert, artists performed songs for which they donated their royalties, some in perpetuity, to benefit the cause. She was appointed a Goodwill Ambassador to the United Nations Environment Programme.\n\nIn 1991, she became the National Spokesperson for the Colette Chuda Environmental Fund/CHEC (Children's Health Environmental Coalition) following the death of four-year-old Colette Chuda, a family friend, from cancer. (Chuda was featured along with Newton-John and daughter Chloe on the cover of Newton-John's \"Warm and Tender\" album.)\n\nNewton-John's cancer diagnosis also affected the type of music she recorded. In 1994, she released \"Gaia: One Woman's Journey\" which chronicled her ordeal. This was the first album on which Newton-John wrote all of the songs encouraging her to become more active as a songwriter thereafter. In 2005, she released \"Stronger Than Before,\" sold exclusively in the U.S. by Hallmark. This was her second exclusive album for Hallmark Cards after her successful first Christmas album \"'Tis the Season\" with Vince Gill five years earlier. Proceeds from the album's sales benefited breast cancer research. The album featured the song \"Phenomenal Woman\" based on the poem by Maya Angelou that featured guest vocals from Diahann Carroll, Beth Nielsen Chapman, Delta Goodrem, Amy Holland, Patti LaBelle and Mindy Smith – all survivors of or affected by cancer.\n\nThe following year, Newton-John released a healing CD, \"Grace and Gratitude.\" The album was sold exclusively by Walgreens also to benefit various charities including Y-ME National Breast Cancer Organization. The CD was the \"heart\" of their \"Body – Heart – Spirit\" Wellness Collection which also featured a re-branded Liv-Kit and breast-health dietary supplements. She re-recorded some tracks from \"Grace and Gratitude\" in 2010 and re-released the album as \"Grace and Gratitude Renewed\" on the Green Hill music label. The \"Renewed\" CD includes a new track, \"Help Me to Heal\", not featured on the original album. The \"Renewed\" CD yielded Newton-John's first appearances on the \"Billboard\" Christian Albums (No. 36), Christian & Gospel Albums (No. 54) and New Age Albums (No. 2) charts.\n\nIn 2008, she raised funds to help build the Olivia Newton-John Cancer and Wellness Centre in Melbourne, Australia. She led a three-week, 228 km. walk along the Great Wall of China during April joined by various celebrities and cancer survivors throughout her trek. The walk symbolised the steps cancer patients must take on their road to recovery.\n\nShe released a companion CD, \"A Celebration in Song,\" the following month in Australia and later worldwide featuring new and previously recorded duets by \"Olivia Newton-John & Friends\", including Jann Arden, Jimmy Barnes, John Farrar, Barry Gibb, Delta Goodrem, Sun Ho, Richard Marx, Cliff Richard, Melinda Schneider, Amy Sky, and Keith Urban.\n\nNewton-John was featured in UniGlobe Entertainment's breast cancer docu-drama, \"1 a Minute\", released in October 2010. The documentary was made by actress Namrata Singh Gujral and featured other celebrities who had survived breast cancer or who were affected by the disease. During the same month, Bluewater Productions released a comic book featuring Newton-John to coincide with Breast Cancer Awareness Month.\n\nNewton-John was listed as president of the Isle of Man Basking Shark Society between 1998 and 2005.\n\nNewton-John continued to record and perform pop-oriented music as well. In 1998, she returned to Nashville to record \"Back with a Heart\" (No. 59 Pop). The album returned her to the Top 10 (No. 9) on the Country Albums chart. Its first single was a re-recording of \"I Honestly Love You\" produced by David Foster and featuring Kenneth \"Babyface\" Edmonds on background vocals that charted Pop (No. 67) and AC (No. 18). Country radio dismissed the song, though it did peak at No. 16 on the Country Sales chart. The album track, \"Love Is a Gift,\" won Newton-John a 1999 Daytime Emmy Award for Outstanding Original Song after being featured on the daytime serial, \"As the World Turns\".\n\nNewton-John's subsequent secular albums were released primarily in Australia. Newton-John, John Farnham and Anthony Warlow toured Australia as \"The Main Event.\" The live album won an ARIA Award for Highest Selling Australian CD and was also nominated for Best Adult Contemporary Album. She and Farnham performed \"Dare to Dream\" at the Opening Ceremony of the 2000 Sydney Olympics.\n\nIn 2002, Newton-John released \"(2),\" a duets album featuring mostly Australian artists (Tina Arena, Darren Hayes, Jimmy Little, Johnny O'Keefe, Billy Thorpe, Keith Urban) as well as a heartfelt \"duet\" with the deceased Peter Allen. The same year, Newton-John was inducted into Australia's ARIA Hall of Fame. \",\" a tribute album covering songs by artists such as Joan Baez, the Carpenters, Doris Day, Nina Simone, Minnie Riperton and others, was released in 2004. She dedicated the album to her mother, who had died the previous year.\n\nNewton-John also released several Christmas albums. In 2000, she teamed with Vince Gill and the London Symphony Orchestra for \"'Tis the Season\" sold exclusively through Hallmark. The following year, she released \"The Christmas Collection\" which compiled seasonal music previously recorded for her Hallmark Christmas album, her appearance on Kenny Loggins' 1999 TNN Christmas special and her contributions to the \"Mother and Child\" and \"Spirit of Christmas\" multi-artist collections. (Green Hill Records re-released this album with different artwork in 2010.) In 2007, she re-teamed with her \"Grace and Gratitude\" producer, Amy Sky, for \"Christmas Wish\" (No. 187 Pop) which was sold exclusively by Target in its first year of release.\n\nNewton-John acted occasionally since \"Two of a Kind\". She appeared in a supporting role in the 1996 AIDS drama, \"It's My Party\". In 2000, she appeared in a dramatically different role as Bitsy Mae Harling, a lesbian ex-con country singer, in Del Shores' \"Sordid Lives\". Newton-John reprised her role for \"\" which aired one season on the LOGO television network. The series featured five original songs written and composed by Newton-John specifically for the show. In 2010, Newton-John starred in the film \"\", released in Canada. Newton-John portrayed Hope Gordon, the mother of a home-schooled hockey prodigy. The film opened the 2010 Toronto International Film Festival.\n\nDuring October–December 1998, Newton-John, John Farnham and Anthony Warlow performed in The Main Event Tour. The album \"Highlights from The Main Event\" peaked at No. 1 in December, sold 4× platinum, and won 'Highest Selling Album' at the 1999 ARIA Awards. \"The Main Event\" concert was broadcast on national TV and released on video.\n\nFor the 2000 Summer Olympics, Newton-John and John Farnham performed \"Dare to Dream\" during the Parade of Nations at the Opening Ceremony. Broadcast of the ceremony was viewed by an estimated 3.5 billion people around the world.\n\nNewton-John's television work included starring in two Christmas films, \"A mother for Christmas\" (1990) and \"A Christmas Romance\" (1994) – both Top 10 Nielsen hits. Her daughter, Chloe, starred as one of her children in both \"A Christmas Romance\" and in the 2001 Showtime film \"The Wilde Girls\"> She guest-starred as herself in the sitcoms \"Ned and Stacey\", \"Murphy Brown\", and \"Bette\", and made two appearances as herself on \"Glee\".\n\nFor her first \"Glee\" appearance, Newton-John re-created her \"Physical\" video with series regular Jane Lynch. The performance was released as a digital single, returning Newton-John to the \"Billboard\" Hot 100 (No. 89) for the first time since her 1998 re-release of \"I Honestly Love You\". In Australia, Newton-John hosted the animal and nature series \"Wild Life\" and guest starred as Joanna on two episodes of the Australian series \"The Man From Snowy River\".\n\nNewton-John met gaffer/cameraman Patrick McDermott a year after her 1995 divorce from Matt Lattanzi. The couple dated on and off for nine years. McDermott disappeared following a 2005 fishing trip off the Californian coast. Various theories abounded regarding his disappearance ranging from his death by accident or foul play to McDermott staging his disappearance to avoid child support payments to his ex-wife, actress Yvette Nipar. Newton-John, who was in Australia at her Gaia Retreat & Spa at the time of his disappearance, was never a suspect in McDermott's disappearance.\n\nA US Coast Guard investigation, based on then-available evidence and released in 2008, \"suggest[ed] McDermott was lost at sea\", although some have claimed contact with McDermott since his disappearance. In April 2010, private detectives searching for McDermott claimed he was found living in Mexico under his birth name, Pat Kim.\n\nNewton-John returned to the tabloid headlines again in 2007 when it was revealed that her daughter, Chloe, was recovering from anorexia.\n\nNewton-John released another concert DVD, \"Olivia Newton-John and the Sydney Symphony: Live at the Sydney Opera House,\" and a companion CD, \"Olivia's Live Hits\", in January 2008. An edited version of the DVD premiered on PBS station, WLIW (Garden City, New York) in October 2007 and subsequently aired nationally during the network's fund-raising pledge drives. This was Newton-John's third live album after the 1981 Japanese release, \"Love Performance,\" and her 2000 Australian release, \"One Woman's Live Journey\".\n\nIn 2008, Newton-John took part in the BBC Wales program \"Coming Home\" about her Welsh family history. In June 2008, she secretly wed John Easterling, founder and president of natural remedy firm Amazon Herb Company. The couple had first met 15 years earlier, but they only became romantically involved in 2007. (Like Newton-John, this was Easterling's second marriage.) The couple married alone in a private Incan spiritual ceremony in Cuzco, Peru on 21 June followed nine days later by a legal ceremony on the Jupiter Island beachfront in Florida. There were no guests at either service since the couple preferred to marry simply and privately. Only Newton-John's daughter, Chloe, was aware of the nuptials. The couple did not announce their marriage until a 4 July barbecue at Newton-John's Malibu, California home, where guests were surprised with the news. The wedding was confirmed thereafter by \"HELLO!\" Magazine which published exclusive pictures of both weddings. In June 2009, the Easterlings purchased a new $4.1 million home in Jupiter Inlet, Florida, and Newton-John sold her Malibu home.\n\nIn 2009, Newton-John appeared on Andrea Bocelli's holiday album \"My Christmas\" and PBS TV holiday special \"My Christmas Special\", with David Foster, Kenny Loggins and Richard Marx.\n\nIn January 2011, Newton-John began filming the comedy \"A Few Best Men\" in Australia with director Stephan Elliott, in the role of mother of the bride. The groom is played by Xavier Samuel.\n\nNewton-John still actively tours. An Australian tour of Perth, Melbourne and Sydney, as well a tour of the United States, treated fans to songs that she had never performed in concert before. In November 2012, Newton-John teamed with John Travolta to make the charity album \"This Christmas\", in support of The Olivia Newton-John Cancer & Wellness Centre and the Jett Travolta Foundation. Artists featured on the album include: Barbra Streisand, James Taylor, Chick Corea, Kenny G, Tony Bennett, Cliff Richard and the Count Basie Orchestra. In March 2013 she toured the UK performing in Bournemouth, London, Brighton, Birmingham and Manchester.\n\nA 2013 residency at the Flamingo Las Vegas was postponed due to the May 2013 death of her elder sister, Rona (aged 70), from a brain tumor. Newton-John resumed with 45 shows beginning in April 2014. In conjunction with the upcoming Vegas shows, Newton-John released a new EP in April 2014 entitled \"Hotel Sessions\", which consisted of seven tracks of unreleased demos that were recorded between 2002 and 2011 with her nephew Brett Goldsmith. The CD contains a cover of \"Broken Wings\" as well as the popular-with-fans original \"Best of My Love\", which had leaked on the internet many years prior.\n\nIn 2015, Newton-John was a guest judge on an episode of \"RuPaul's Drag Race\". That same year, she scored her first number-one single on \"Billboard\" Dance Club Songs chart with \"You Have To Believe\" with daughter Chloe and producer Dave Aude. The song was a re-imaging of her 1980 single \"Magic\", which she notes was to celebrate both the 35th anniversary of \"Xanadu\" and as a dedication to her daughter, stating \"I met Chloe's dad on the set of \"Xanadu\", so, without that film, Chloe wouldn't be here. She was the real 'magic' that came out of that film!\" The song became the first mother-daughter single to reach No. 1 on the \"Billboard\" Dance Club Play chart.\n\nIn May 2017, it was announced that Newton-John's breast cancer had returned and metastasised to her lower back.\n\nHeadlining\n\n\nCo-headlining\n\nResidency show\n\n\n\n"}

After a two-year rampage from 2004 to 2006, an elephant was eventually shot; but some were doubtful that the right animal was killed.\n\nOsama bin Laden was a rogue bull elephant active in the Indian state of Assam. He was named after the terrorist Osama bin Laden. At the time of the attacks, the elephant was thought to be between 45 and 50 years old. He measured between tall. He was given the status of a \"rogue\" elephant in the summer of 2006 after his death toll reached double figures.\n\nThe elephant was said not to fear firecrackers or fire. During his attacks, he killed 27 people in the state of Assam, including 14 over the course of six months prior to his death.\n\nThe state capital, Gauhati, is southwest of Behali near Tezpur. The province has an estimated population of 5,300 Asiatic elephants.\n\nIn northeastern India, human and elephant conflicts have become problematic. Expansion of human activities and destruction of elephants' natural habitat has resulted in elephants foraging for food where humans are situated. From 2001 to 2006 in Assam, more than 250 people were killed by elephants; distraught villagers killed 268 elephants, mainly by poisoning.\n\nIndian officials issued a \"shoot to kill\" directive in mid December 2006, with a deadline of the end of the month. On 18 December, it was announced that the elephant had been tracked to a tea plantation near Behali, a town north-west of Guwahati. Local villagers used drums and fire to trap the elephant in the corner of the plantation. He was killed by hunter Dipen Phukan; however, once the elephant realised what was about to happen he charged the hunter, who killed him as he rapidly approached. Phukan said, \"It was charging towards me and I kept firing. Another few yards and it would have run over me.\" It had been identified as Osama bin Laden as it had no tusks. \n\nHowever officials were concerned that it was not the right elephant, with the death taking place a considerable distance – – from where he had been seen previously. Forestry officials were accused of killing an innocent elephant, while conservation groups were concerned about the possibility of revenge attacks by other elephants of the same herd.\n\nIn 2008, another elephant also named \"Osama bin Laden\" – that caused more than 11 fatalities and dozens of injuries – was shot dead in Jharkhand.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "45416", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=45416", "title": "Richard D'Oyly Carte", "text": "Richard D'Oyly Carte\n\nRichard D'Oyly Carte (3 May 1844 – 3 April 1901) was an English talent agent, theatrical impresario, composer and hotelier during the latter half of the Victorian era. Rising from humble beginnings, Carte built two of London's theatres and a hotel empire, while also establishing an opera company that ran continuously for over a hundred years and a management agency representing some of the most important artists of the day.\n\nCarte started his career working for his father, Richard Carte, in the music publishing and musical instrument manufacturing business. As a young man, he conducted and composed music, but he soon turned to promoting the entertainment careers of others through his management agency. Carte believed that a school of wholesome, well-crafted, family-friendly, English comic opera could be as popular as the risqué French works dominating the London musical stage in the 1870s. To that end, he brought together the dramatist W. S. Gilbert and composer Arthur Sullivan and, together with his wife Helen Carte, he nurtured their collaboration on a series of thirteen Savoy operas. He founded the D'Oyly Carte Opera Company and built the state-of-the-art Savoy Theatre to host the Gilbert and Sullivan operas.\n\nCarte also built the Savoy Hotel in London, and acquired other luxury hotels. In addition, he erected the Palace Theatre, London, which he had intended to be the home of a new school of English grand opera, although this ambition was not realised beyond the production of a single grand opera by Sullivan, \"Ivanhoe\". Nevertheless, his partnership with Gilbert and Sullivan, and his careful management of their operas and relationship, created a series of works whose success was unprecedented in the history of musical theatre. His opera company, later operated by Helen and then by his son, Rupert, and granddaughter, Bridget, promoted those works for over a century, and they are still performed regularly today.\n\nCarte was born in Greek Street in the West End of London on 3 May 1844. He was the eldest of six children. His father, Richard Carte (originally Cart; 1808–1891), was a flautist, and his mother was the former Eliza Jones (1814–1885); they had eloped, to the disappointment of her father, Thomas Jones, a clergyman. His siblings were Blanch (1846–1935), Viola (1848–1925), Rose (b. 1854), Henry (1856–1926) and Eliza (1860–1941). Carte was of Welsh and Norman ancestry; D'Oyly is a Norman French name which \"was a forename (not part of a double surname)\". To supplement his income as a performer, Carte's father joined the firm of Rudall, Rose & Co., musical instrument makers and music publishers, in 1850. After he became a partner in the business, it changed its name to Rudall, Rose, Carte and Co. and later to Rudall, Carte & Co.\n\nCarte was brought up in Dartmouth Park Road. His cultured mother exposed her family to art, music and poetry, and young Carte studied the violin and then the flute at an early age. The family spoke French at home two days a week, and his parents often took their children to the theatre. He was educated at University College School, which he left in 1860. In 1861, he achieved First Class level in the matriculation examination and then attended University College, London. However, he left later that year to work in his father's business, along with his brother, Henry. He studied music during this time and composed some pieces, which he dedicated to the actress Kate Terry. He also acted in amateur theatricals.\n\nBetween 1868 and 1877, Carte wrote and published the music for a number of his own songs and instrumental works, as well as several comic operas: \"Doctor Ambrosias – His Secret\", at St. George's Hall (1868); \"Marie\", with librettist E. Spencer Mott, at London's Opera Comique in 1871; and \"Happy Hampstead\", with librettist Frank Desprez, which debuted on an 1876 provincial tour and then played at the Royalty Theatre in 1877. On tour in 1871, Carte conducted \"Cox and Box\" by composer Arthur Sullivan and dramatist F. C. Burnand, in tandem with English adaptations of two Offenbach pieces, called \"Rose of Auvergne\" and \"Breaking the Spell\", in which Carte's client Selina Dolaro appeared. Carte's musical talent would be helpful later in his career, as he was able to audition singers himself from the pianoforte.\n\nDuring the late 1860s and early 1870s, from within his father's firm in Charing Cross and, by late 1874, from a nearby address in Craig's Court, Carte began to build an operatic, concert and lecture management agency. His two hundred clients eventually included Charles Gounod, Jacques Offenbach, Adelina Patti, Mario, Clara Schumann, Antoinette Sterling, Edward Lloyd, Mr. and Mrs. German Reed, George Grossmith, Matthew Arnold, James McNeill Whistler and Oscar Wilde. Hesketh Pearson said of Carte: \"His acute business sense was aided by a frank and agreeable manner... He took what other people thought were risks, but he felt were certainties. He knew everyone worth knowing... and his practical judgement was as sure as his sense of artistry.\"\n\nIn 1874, Carte leased the Opera Comique, a theatre off the Strand, where he presented Charles Lecocq's new opéra bouffe \"Giroflé-Girofla\", given in French by the company who had premiered the work three months earlier in Brussels. He followed this with \"The Broken Branch\", an English adaptation of Gaston Serpette's \"La branche cassée\". Carte announced his ambitions on the front of the programme for the latter: \"It is my desire to establish in London a permanent abode for light Opera.\" \"The Observer\" reported, \"Mr D'Oyly Carte is not only a skilful manager, but a trained musician, and he appears to have grasped the fact that the public are beginning to become weary of what is known as a genuine opera bouffe, and are ready to welcome a musical entertainment of a higher order, such as a musician might produce with satisfaction\".\n\nCarte later said it was \"the scheme of my life\" to found a school of high-quality, family-friendly English comic opera, in contrast to the bawdy burlesques and adaptations of French operettas that dominated the London musical stage at that time. His experience in writing operettas, however, had convinced him that his own creative talents were inadequate for the task. He later wrote to the dramatist W. S. Gilbert, \"I envy your position but I could never attain it. If I could be an author like you I would certainly not be a manager. I am simply the tradesman who sells your works of art.\" Furthermore, in 1874 Carte did not yet have the resources to make his idea into reality, and after his season at the Opera Comique, he terminated his lease. In the same year, he arranged for his client, Offenbach, to collaborate with H. B. Farnie to write a new operetta on the theme of \"Dick Whittington and His Cat\", which played during the Christmas season at the Alhambra Theatre.\n\nIn 1875, Carte became the business manager of the Royalty Theatre, under the direction of his client, the popular singing actress Madame Selina Dolaro. There he programmed Offenbach's \"La Périchole\". To fill out the evening (as long programmes were the fashion in Victorian theatre), he needed another piece. He remembered a libretto for a one-act comic opera that W. S. Gilbert had written and shown to him in 1873, called \"Trial by Jury\". Meanwhile, Sullivan's popular 1867 opera, \"Cox and Box\", had been revived at the Gaiety Theatre in 1874, and Carte had already asked him to write a piece for the Royalty. Carte knew that Gilbert had worked with Sullivan to create \"Thespis\" in 1871, and he now suggested that Sullivan could write the music for \"Trial by Jury\". Because Gilbert and Sullivan shared his vision of increasing the quality and respectability of English musical theatre, and so broadening its audience through the promotion of well-crafted English light operas, Carte gave them wider authority as director and music director than was customary at that time. \"Trial by Jury\", a comic treatment of an English courtroom, was an unexpected hit, outrunning \"La Périchole\", and becoming the first step in Carte's scheme to establish a new genre of English comic opera.\nCarte managed the first tour of \"Trial by Jury\", which stopped at the Theatre Royal in Dublin, Ireland, in September 1875. While there, he met a young Scottish actress, Susan Couper Black, who used the stage name Helen Lenoir. She became fascinated by his vision for establishing a company to promote English comic opera and gave up her next engagement to join his theatrical organisation as his secretary. Well-educated, with an organisational ability, business acumen, focus on detail and diplomatic skills that surpassed even Carte's, Lenoir gradually became intensely involved in all of his business affairs. Carte and Lenoir married in 1888, three years after the death of his first wife.\n\nEven after the initial production of \"Trial by Jury\", however, Carte continued to produce continental operetta, touring in the summer of 1876 with a repertoire consisting of English adaptations of French opera bouffe (Offenbach’s \"La Périchole\", and \"La Grande-Duchesse de Gérolstein\", Lecocq's \"La fille de Madame Angot\" and Léon Vasseur's \"La Timbale d'argent\"), paired with two one-act English after-pieces (\"Happy Hampstead\" and \"Trial by Jury\"). Carte acted as the musical director of this travelling company that included W.H. Denny.\n\nEncouraged by the success of \"Trial by Jury\", Carte made attempts in 1875–76 to raise money for either a revival of \"Thespis\" or a new piece. A year later, he finally found four backers and formed the \"Comedy Opera Company\" to produce the future works of Gilbert and Sullivan, along with the works of other British author/composer teams. This allowed Carte to lease the Opera Comique and to give Gilbert and Sullivan firm terms for a new opera. By this time, Helen Lenoir had been promoted from Carte's secretary to his assistant. The first comic opera produced by the new company was Gilbert and Sullivan's \"The Sorcerer\" in 1877, with a plot involving a tradesmanlike London magician and his patented love potion. Gilbert, Sullivan and Carte were able to select their own cast, instead of using the players under contract to the theatre where the work was produced, as had been the case with their earlier works. They chose talented actors, few of whom were well-known stars, and Carte's agency provided many of the artists. The reception of the piece showed that Carte had been right: there was a promising future in family-friendly English comic opera.\n\n\"The Sorcerer\" was followed by \"H.M.S. Pinafore\" in 1878. Business for the new opera was slow at first. Carte's investors in the Comedy Opera Company advocated cutting their losses and closing the show. After promotional efforts by Carte and Sullivan, who included some of the \"Pinafore\" music in several promenade concerts at Covent Garden, \"Pinafore\" became a hit. Carte persuaded Gilbert and Sullivan that when their original agreement with the Comedy Opera Company expired in July 1879, a business partnership among the three of them would be to their advantage. The three each put up £1,000 and formed a new partnership under the name \"Mr Richard D'Oyly Carte's Opera Company\". Under the partnership agreement, once the expenses of mounting the productions had been deducted, each of the three men was entitled to one third of the profits.\n\nOn 31 July 1879, the last day of their agreement with Carte, the directors of the Comedy Opera Company attempted to repossess the \"Pinafore\" set by force during a performance, causing a celebrated fracas. Carte's stagehands managed to ward off their backstage attackers and protect the scenery and props. The Comedy Opera Company opened a rival production of \"H.M.S. Pinafore\" in London, but it was not as popular as the D'Oyly Carte production and soon closed. Legal action over the ownership of the rights ended in victory for Carte, Gilbert and Sullivan. From 1 August 1879, the new company, later called the D'Oyly Carte Opera Company, became the sole authorised producer of the works of Gilbert and Sullivan.\n\n\"H.M.S. Pinafore\" was so successful that Carte soon sent two additional companies out to tour in the provinces. The opera ran for 571 performances in London, the second-longest run in musical theatre history up to that time. Over 150 unauthorised productions sprang up in America alone, but because American law then offered no copyright protection to foreigners, Carte, Gilbert and Sullivan were not able to demand royalties from, or to control the artistic content of, these productions.\n\nTo try to counter this copyright piracy and make some money from the popularity of their opera in America, Carte travelled to New York with the authors and the company to present an \"authentic\" production of \"Pinafore\" there, beginning in December 1879, as well as American tours. Carte's assistant, Helen Lenoir, who became his wife in 1888, made fifteen visits to America in the 1880s and 1890s to promote Carte's interests, superintending arrangements for American productions and tours of each of the new Gilbert and Sullivan operas. Beginning with \"Pinafore\", Carte licensed the J. C. Williamson company to produce the works in Australia and New Zealand.\n\nIn an effort to head off unauthorised American productions of their next opera, \"The Pirates of Penzance\", Carte and his partners opened it in New York on 31 December 1879, prior to its 1880 London premiere. They hoped to forestall further \"piracy\" by establishing the authorised production and tours in America before others could copy it and by delaying publication of the score and libretto. They did succeed in keeping for themselves the direct profits of the venture, but they tried without success for many years to control the American performance copyrights over their operas. \"Pirates\" was an immediate hit in New York, and later London, becoming one of the most popular Gilbert and Sullivan operas. To secure the British copyright, there was a perfunctory performance the afternoon before the New York premiere, at the Royal Bijou Theatre, Paignton, Devon, organised by Helen Lenoir.\nThe next Gilbert and Sullivan opera, \"Patience\", opened at the Opera Comique in April 1881 and was another big success, usurping Pinafore's position as the longest running piece in the series with the second-longest run in musical theatre history. \"Patience\" satirised the self-indulgent aesthetic movement of the 1870s and '80s in England. To popularise the opera in America, in 1882 Carte sent one of the artistes under his management, the young poet Oscar Wilde, on a lecture tour to explain to Americans what the aesthetic movement was about. Carte told an interviewer at that time that he had fifteen theatrical companies and performers touring simultaneously in Europe, America and Australia.\n\nCarte had been planning to build a new theatre for several years to promote English comic opera and, in particular, the Gilbert and Sullivan operas. With profits from the Gilbert and Sullivan operas and his concert and lecture agency, he bought property along the Strand in 1880 with frontage onto the Thames Embankment, where he built the Savoy Theatre in 1881. Carte chose the name in honour of the Savoy Palace, which had been built on the site in the thirteenth century by Peter, Count of Savoy. It later passed to John of Gaunt but was destroyed in the Peasants' Revolt in 1381. The Savoy Theatre was a state-of-the-art facility, setting a new standard for technology, comfort and decor. It was the first public building in the world to be lit entirely by electric lights and seated nearly 1,300 people (compared to the Opera Comique's 862).\n\n\"Patience\" was the first production at the new theatre, transferring there on 10 October 1881. The first generator proved too small to power the whole building, and though the entire front of house was electrically lit, the stage was lit by gas until 28 December 1881. At that performance, Carte stepped on stage and broke a glowing lightbulb before the audience to demonstrate the safety of the new technology. \"The Times\" concluded that the theatre \"is admirably adapted for its purpose, its acoustic qualities are excellent, and all reasonable demands of comfort and taste are complied with.\" Carte and his manager, George Edwardes (later famous as manager of the Gaiety Theatre), introduced several innovations at the theatre including free programme booklets, the orderly \"queue\" system with numbered tickets for the pit and gallery (an American idea), tea served at the interval and a policy of no tipping for cloakroom or other services. Daily expenses at the theatre were about half the possible takings from ticket sales. The last eight of Gilbert and Sullivan's comic operas were premiered at the Savoy, and all of their operas came to be known as Savoy operas.\nThe Savoy Hotel, designed by the architect Thomas Edward Collcutt, opened in 1889. Financed by profits from \"The Mikado\", it was the first hotel lit by electric lights and the first with electric lifts. In the 1890s, under its famous manager, César Ritz, and chef Auguste Escoffier, it became a well-known luxury hotel and would generate more income and contribute more to the D'Oyly Carte fortunes than any other enterprise, including the opera companies. Carte later acquired and refurbished Claridge's (1893), The Grand Hotel in Rome (1896), Simpson's-in-the-Strand (1898) and The Berkeley (1900).\n\nDuring the years when the Gilbert and Sullivan operas were being written, Richard D'Oyly Carte also produced operas and plays by other writing teams, as well as other works to fill the Savoy Theatre in between new operas. Many of these were companion pieces to the Gilbert and Sullivan operas, as the Victorian audiences preferred long evenings in the theatre. Some, however, were new full-length pieces either for the Savoy or for Carte's touring companies, which toured the Gilbert and Sullivan operas, and these new works, extensively. Carte and Lenoir also continued to run his management agency. As an example of their level of activity, an 1881 souvenir programme commemorating the 250th performance of \"Patience\" in London and its 100th performance in New York states that, in addition to these two productions of \"Patience\", Carte was simultaneously producing many other projects. These included two companies touring with \"Patience\", two touring with other Gilbert and Sullivan operas, one touring with the operetta \"Olivette\" (co-produced with Charles Wyndham), one with \"Claude Duval\" in America, a production of \"Youth\" running at a New York theatre, a lecture tour by Archibald Forbes (a war correspondent) and productions of \"Patience\", \"Pirates\", \"Claude Duval\" and \"Billee Taylor\" in association with J. C. Williamson in Australia, among other things.\n\nCarte also introduced the practice of licensing amateur theatrical societies to present works for which he held the rights, increasing the works' popularity and the sales of scores and libretti, as well as the rental of band parts. This had an important influence on amateur theatre in general. Cellier and Bridgeman wrote in 1914 that, prior to the creation of the Savoy operas, amateur actors were treated with contempt by professionals. After the formation of amateur Gilbert and Sullivan companies licensed to perform the operas, professionals recognised that the amateur societies \"support the culture of music and the drama. They are now accepted as useful training schools for the legitimate stage, and from the volunteer ranks have sprung many present-day favourites.\" Cellier and Bridgeman attributed the rise in quality and reputation of the amateur groups largely to \"the popularity of, and infectious craze for performing, the Gilbert and Sullivan operas\". The National Operatic and Dramatic Association was founded in 1899. It reported, in 1914, that nearly 200 British societies were producing Gilbert and Sullivan operas that year.\n\nAfter \"Patience\", Carte produced \"Iolanthe\", which opened in 1882. During its run, in February 1883, Carte signed a five-year partnership agreement with Gilbert and Sullivan, obliging them to create new operas for him upon six months' notice. Sullivan had not intended to immediately write a new work with Gilbert, but he suffered a serious financial loss when his broker went bankrupt in November 1882 and must have felt the long-term contract necessary for his security. Gilbert scholar Andrew Crowther comments, \"Effectively, [the contract] made [Gilbert and Sullivan] Carte's employees – a situation which created its own resentments.\" The partnership's next opera, \"Princess Ida\", opened in January 1884. Carte soon saw that \"Ida\" was running weakly at the box office and invoked the agreement to call upon his partners to write a new opera. The musical establishment constantly pressured Sullivan to abandon comic opera in favour of serious music, and after he was knighted in 1883, the pressure only increased. He soon regretted having signed the five-year contract. In March 1884, Sullivan told Carte that \"it is impossible for me to do another piece of the character of those already written by Gilbert and myself.\"\n\nDuring this conflict and others during the 1880s, Carte and Helen Lenoir frequently worked to smooth over the partners' differences using a mixture of friendship and business acumen. Sullivan asked to be released from the partnership on several occasions. Nevertheless, Carte was able to coax eight comic operas out of his partners in the 1880s. When \"Princess Ida\" closed after a comparatively short run of nine months, for the first time in the partnership's history, the next opera was not ready. Gilbert first suggested a plot in which people fell in love against their wills after taking a magic lozenge – a scenario that Sullivan had previously rejected. Gilbert eventually came up with a new idea and began work in May 1884.\nCarte produced the first revival of \"The Sorcerer\", together with \"Trial by Jury\", and matinees of \"The Pirates of Penzance\" played by a cast of children, while he waited for his partners to finish writing the new work. This became the partnership's most successful opera, \"The Mikado\", which opened in March 1885. The piece satirised British institutions by setting them in a fictional Japan and took advantage of the Victorian craze for the exotic and \"picturesque\" Far East. \"The Mikado\" became the partnership's longest-running hit, lasting for 672 performances at the Savoy Theatre, and supplanting \"Patience\" as the second-longest-running work of musical theatre up to that time. It was extraordinarily popular in the US and worldwide and remains the most frequently performed Savoy Opera.\n\nThe partnership's next opera was \"Ruddigore\", which opened in January 1887. The piece, though a financial success, was a relative disappointment after the extraordinary run of \"The Mikado\". When \"Ruddigore\" closed after nine months, Carte mounted revivals of earlier Gilbert and Sullivan operas at the Savoy for almost a year. After another attempt by Gilbert to persuade Sullivan to set a \"lozenge plot\", Gilbert met his collaborator half way by writing a serio-comic plot for \"The Yeomen of the Guard\", which premiered in October 1888. The opera ran for over a year, with strong New York and touring productions. This was a happy time for Carte, with a long-running opera, new marriage and new hotel and opera house under construction. When Carte asked his partners for a new work, Sullivan again expressed reluctance to write another comic opera, asking if Gilbert would write a \"dramatic work on a larger musical scale\". Gilbert declined but offered a compromise that Sullivan ultimately accepted: the two would write a light opera for the Savoy, and at the same time, Sullivan could work on a grand opera that Carte would produce at a new theatre he was planning to build to present British grand opera. The new comic opera was \"The Gondoliers\", which opened in December 1889 and became one of the partnership's greatest successes.\n\nDuring these years, Carte was not just the manager of the theatre. He was a full participant in the producing partnership with Gilbert and Sullivan, involved in casting and finding designers; in charge of publicity; directing and hiring designers for the non-Gilbert works, including the many companion pieces (sometimes with the help of assistants); and casting, directing and rehearsing the touring companies, among other duties. According to Henry Lytton, \"Mr. Carte was a great stage manager. He could take in the details of a scene with one sweep of his eagle eye and say unerringly just what was wrong.\" The quality of Carte's productions created a national and international taste for them, and he sent touring companies throughout the British provinces, to America (generally managed by Helen), Europe and elsewhere. Queen Victoria honoured the company by calling for a Royal Command Performance of \"The Gondoliers\" at Windsor Castle in 1891. Following the libretto closely, she noticed additions to the text made by some of the actors and asked Carte to explain why this was done. Carte replied that they \"are what we call 'gags'\". The queen answered that she had always understood that \"gags were things that were put by authority into people's mouths.\" Carte rejoined, \"These gags, Your Majesty, are things people put into their own mouths without authority.\" Bernard Shaw, writing in \"The World\" in October 1893, stated:\n\nOn 22 April 1890, during the run of \"The Gondoliers\", Gilbert discovered that maintenance expenses for the theatre, including a new £500 carpet for the front lobby of the theatre, were being charged to the partnership instead of borne by Carte. Gilbert angrily confronted Carte, but Carte refused to reconsider the accounts. Even though the amount of the charge was not great, Gilbert felt that it was a moral issue involving Carte's integrity, and he could not look past it. Gilbert stormed out and wrote to Sullivan that \"I left him with the remark that it was a mistake to kick down the ladder by which he had risen\". Helen Carte wrote that Gilbert had addressed Carte \"in a way that I should not have thought you would have used to an offending menial.\" Matters deteriorated further, and Gilbert brought a lawsuit. Sullivan sided with Carte, who was building the Royal English Opera House, the inaugural production of which was to be Sullivan's forthcoming grand opera. Gilbert won the dispute and felt vindicated, but his actions had been hurtful to his partners, and the partnership disbanded.\n\nCarte's first production at the Royal English Opera House was of Sullivan's only grand opera, \"Ivanhoe\", which opened in January 1891. It played for an initial run of 155 performances, a record for an opera, but no other operas shared the new opera house with it. Instead, \"Ivanhoe\" was presented every night with alternating casts. When \"Ivanhoe\" finally closed in July, Carte had no new work ready to play at the opera house, and so it had to close. The opera house re-opened in November 1891 with André Messager's \"La Basoche\" at first alternating in repertory with \"Ivanhoe\", and then \"La Basoche\" played alone, closing in January 1892. Carte again had no new opera to present at the house, and the venture soon failed. Sir Henry Wood, who had been répétiteur for the production, recalled in his autobiography, \"If D'Oyly Carte had had a repertory of six operas instead of only one, I believe he would have established English opera in London for all time. Towards the end of the run of \"Ivanhoe\" I was already preparing \"The Flying Dutchman\" with Eugène Oudin in the name part. He would have been superb. However, plans were altered and the \"Dutchman\" was shelved.\" Carte leased the theatre to Sarah Bernhardt for a season and finally abandoned the project. He sold the opera house at a loss to producer Augustus Harris. It was then converted into a music hall, the Palace Theatre of Varieties, and later became the Palace Theatre.\nBecause of the carpet quarrel, Gilbert had vowed to write no more for the Savoy. When \"The Gondoliers\" closed in 1891, Carte needed new authors and composers to write works for the Savoy Theatre. He turned to old friends George Dance, Frank Desprez and Edward Solomon for his next piece, \"The Nautch Girl\", which ran for a satisfying 200 performances in 1891–92. Carte then revived Solomon and Sydney Grundy's \"The Vicar of Bray\", which ran through the summer of 1892. Next came Grundy and Sullivan's \"Haddon Hall\", which held the stage until April 1893. While Carte presented new pieces and revivals at the Savoy, his touring companies continued to play throughout Britain and in America. In 1894, for example, Carte had four companies touring Britain and one playing in America.\n\nGilbert's aggressive, though successful, legal action had embittered Carte and Sullivan, but the partnership had been so profitable that Carte and his wife eventually sought to reunite the author and composer. After several attempts by the Cartes, the reconciliation finally came through the efforts of Tom Chappell, who published the sheet music to their operas. In 1893, Gilbert and Sullivan produced their penultimate collaboration, \"Utopia, Limited\". While \"Utopia\" was being prepared, Carte produced \"Jane Annie\", by J. M. Barrie and Arthur Conan Doyle, with music by Ernest Ford. Despite the popularity of Barrie and Conan Doyle, the show was a flop, closing after only 51 performances.\n\"Utopia\" was Carte's most expensive production to date, but it ran for a comparatively disappointing 245 performances, until June 1894. Carte then played first \"Mirette\", composed by André Messager, then \"The Chieftain\", by F. C. Burnand and Sullivan. These ran for 102 and 97 performances, respectively. The company then toured the London suburbs, and the theatre was dark during the summer of 1895, reopening in November for a revival of \"The Mikado\". This was followed in 1896 by \"The Grand Duke\", which ran for 123 performances and was Gilbert and Sullivan's only financial failure. \"The Gondoliers\" turned out to be Gilbert and Sullivan's last big hit, and after \"The Grand Duke\", the two men never collaborated again. At the Savoy, Carte produced \"His Majesty\" (1897), \"The Grand Duchess of Gerolstein\" (1897), \"The Beauty Stone\" (1898) and \"The Lucky Star\" (1899), as well as revivals of the Gilbert and Sullivan operas.\n\nThough the 1890s brought Carte more disappointments than hits in the theatre, his hotel business prospered and grew. He acquired Simpson's-in-the-Strand and Claridge's Hotel, both of which he entirely rebuilt. There was one grave setback, in 1897, when he had to dismiss his manager, Ritz, and his star chef, Escoffier, for financial misconduct. Carte's choice as successor to Ritz was George Reeves-Smith, manager and part-owner of the Berkeley Hotel. To secure his services, Carte bought the Berkeley in 1900 and promoted Reeves-Smith to be managing director of the whole Savoy Group. Carte had used the same method, a year earlier, to secure a new maître d'hôtel. He was determined to engage M. Joseph, proprietor of the Marivaux Restaurant in Paris, then at the height of its fame. Carte was seriously ill, but he insisted on being carried to the boat-train. In Paris he bought the Marivaux and returned with Joseph to the Savoy.\n\nThroughout the later 1890s, Carte's health was in decline, and Helen assumed more and more of the responsibilities for the opera company. She profitably managed the theatre and the provincial touring companies. In 1894, Carte had hired his son, Rupert, as an assistant. While Carte was ill, in 1897, Rupert assisted Mrs. Carte and W. S. Gilbert with the first revival of \"The Yeomen of the Guard\" at the Savoy. The Savoy put on a number of shows for comparatively short runs during this period, including Sullivan's \"The Beauty Stone\", which ran for only 50 performances, in 1898. In 1899, Carte finally had a new success with Sullivan and Basil Hood's \"The Rose of Persia\", which ran for 213 performances. Neither Carte nor Sullivan lived to see the production of the next piece by Hood, \"The Emerald Isle\", for which Edward German completed Sullivan's unfinished score.\n\nCarte was married twice. His first wife was Blanche Julia Prowse (1853–1885), the daughter of William Prowse, a piano manufacturer, music publisher and booking agent. As a teenager, she had participated in amateur theatricals with Carte. They married in 1870 and had two sons, Lucas (1872–1907) and Rupert. Blanche died of pneumonia in 1885, and in 1888, Carte married his assistant, Helen. Their wedding took place in the Savoy Chapel, with Arthur Sullivan as the best man. Rupert received training in an accounting firm and then became his father's assistant in 1894. Lucas, who was not involved in the family businesses, became a barrister. He was appointed Private Secretary to Lord Chief Justice Charles Russell in 1899 in connection with the Venezuelan boundary arbitration in Paris. There he contracted tuberculosis and later died of that disease at the age of 34.\n\nCarte's London house was at the Adelphi, not far from the Savoy. Passionate about the visual arts as well as the performing arts, Carte invited his friend, the artist James McNeill Whistler, to decorate the house. Whistler had the entire billiard room painted the colour of the billiard cloth, and elsewhere painted his favourite yellow with his own hand. Equally enthusiastic for technological innovation, Carte installed a lift, the first in a private house in England. Around 1890, he bought a small island in the River Thames, between Weybridge and Shepperton, called Folly Eyot, which he renamed D'Oyly Carte Island. He wanted to use the island as an annex to his new Savoy Hotel, but the local authorities refused to grant him a drinks licence for the property. Instead, he built Eyot House, a large house and garden on the island, that he used as a residence. In later years, Carte displayed his macabre sense of humour by keeping a crocodile on the island.\n\nCarte died at his London home from dropsy and heart disease in 1901, just short of his 57th birthday. He is buried in the churchyard of St. Andrew's church in Fairlight, East Sussex, near his parents' graves. A memorial service was held at the Chapel Royal of the Savoy, where a memorial stained glass window was later dedicated to him. He left an estate valued at £250,000.\n\nCarte was instrumental in bringing the British theatre from its low status in the mid-Victorian age to a position of respectable eminence, with knighthoods for actors, such as Henry Irving, and for dramatists, including Gilbert. George Bernard Shaw wrote of Carte's theatrical legacy, \"Mr D'Oyly Carte founded a new school of English comic opera; raised operatic inscenation to the rank of a fine art; and finally built a new English Opera House and made a magnificent effort to do for English grand opera what he had done for comic opera.\" In Carte's obituary, \"The Times\" noted, \"By his refined taste he raised the reputation of the \"mise en scène\" of the Savoy operas to a very high pitch. He set a high standard\". Beyond this, however, Carte's influence, through the production of the Savoy operas, heavily influenced the course of the development of modern musical theatre.\n\nCarte was also a prime mover in making hotels respectable and respected: in the words of the \"Oxford Dictionary of National Biography\": \"Led by the prince of Wales [the Savoy] became the meeting place for London high society and the \"nouveaux riches\" of the British empire... [The] food and the ambience lured people from the clubs to dine in public and give great parties there. It allowed ladies, hitherto fearful of dining in public, to be seen in full regalia in the Savoy dining and supper rooms.\"\nCarte left the theatre, opera company, hotels and his other business interests to Helen. Her London and touring companies continued to present the Savoy Operas in Britain and overseas. In 1901 she leased the Savoy Theatre to William Greet, overseeing his management of a revival of \"Iolanthe\" and several new comic operas. Rupert became chairman of the Savoy Hotel by 1903, which Helen continued to own. In late 1906, Helen staged a Gilbert and Sullivan repertory season at the Savoy Theatre. The season, and the following one, which were both directed by Gilbert, earned excellent reviews and sold well, revitalising the company. After the second repertory season concluded in 1909, however, the company did not perform in London again until 1919, only touring throughout Britain during that time.\n\nAt her death in 1913, Helen passed the family businesses to Carte's son, Rupert. He maintained the hotel business, disposing of the Grand Hotel in Rome, but expanding the group in London. The Savoy Group remained under the control of the Carte family and its associates until 1994. Carte's hotels have remained among the most prestigious in London, with the \"London Evening Standard\" calling the Savoy \"London's most famous hotel\" in 2009.\n\nRupert D'Oyly Carte refreshed the opera company's productions and added London seasons, beginning in 1919, as well as provincial and foreign tours. In 1948 Rupert died, leaving a strong company to his daughter Bridget D'Oyly Carte. However, the rising costs of mounting professional light opera without any government support eventually became too much for the company. Bridget was forced to close the company in 1982. Nevertheless, the Gilbert and Sullivan operas continue to be produced frequently today throughout the English-speaking world and beyond, and Carte's vision of wholesome light operas that celebrate Great Britain endures.\n\n\nCarte's Parlour songs include:\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "23568716", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=23568716", "title": "Robert W. Service", "text": "Robert W. Service\n\nRobert William Service (January 16, 1874 – September 11, 1958) was a British-Canadian poet and writer who has often been called \"the Bard of the Yukon\". He is best known for his poems \"The Shooting of Dan McGrew\" and \"The Cremation of Sam McGee\", from his first book, \"Songs of a Sourdough\" (1907; also published as \"The Spell of the Yukon and Other Verses\"). His vivid descriptions of the Yukon and its people made it seem that he was a veteran of the Klondike Gold Rush, instead of the late-arriving bank clerk he actually was. Although his work remains popular, Service's poems were initially received as being crudely comical works.\n\nService was born in Preston, Lancashire, England, the third of ten children. His father, also Robert Service, was a banker from Kilwinning, Scotland, who had been transferred to England.\n\nWhen he was five, Service was sent to live in Kilwinning with his three maiden aunts and his paternal grandfather, the town's postmaster. There he is said to have composed his first verse, a grace, on his sixth birthday:\n\nAt nine, Service re-joined his parents who had moved to Glasgow. He attended Glasgow's Hillhead High School.\n\nAfter leaving school, Service joined the Commercial Bank of Scotland which would later become the Royal Bank of Scotland. He was writing at this time and reportedly already \"selling his verses\". He was also reading poetry: Browning, Keats, Tennyson, and Thackeray.\n\nWhen he was 21, Service travelled to Vancouver Island, British Columbia, with his Buffalo Bill outfit and dreams of becoming a cowboy. He drifted around western North America, \"wandering from California to British Columbia,\" taking and quitting a series of jobs: \"Starving in Mexico, residing in a California bordello, farming on Vancouver Island and pursuing unrequited love in Vancouver.\" This sometimes required him to leech off his parents' Scottish neighbours and friends who had previously emigrated to Canada.\n\nIn 1899, Service was a store clerk in Cowichan Bay, British Columbia. He mentioned to a customer (Charles H. Gibbons, editor of the Victoria \"Daily Colonist\") that he wrote verses, with the result that six poems by \"R.S.\" on the Boer Wars had appeared in the \"Colonist\" by July 1900 – including \"\" that would later appear in his first book. (Service's brother, Alick, was a prisoner of the Boers at the time. He had been captured on November 15, 1899, alongside Winston Churchill.)\n\nThe \"Colonist\" also published Service's \"\" on September 18, 1901, and \"\" on March 16, 1902.\n\nIn her 2006 biography, \"Under the Spell of the Yukon\", Enid Mallory revealed that Service had fallen in love during this period. He was working as a \"farm labourer and store clerk when he first met Constance MacLean at a dance in Duncan B.C., where she was visiting her uncle.\" MacLean lived in Vancouver, on the mainland, so he courted her by mail. Though he was smitten, \"MacLean was looking for a man of education and means to support her\" so was not that interested. To please her, he took courses at McGill University's Victoria College, but failed.\n\nIn 1903, down on his luck, Service was hired by a Canadian Bank of Commerce branch in Victoria, British Columbia, using his Commercial Bank letter of reference. The bank \"watched him, gave him a raise, and sent him to Kamloops in the middle of British Columbia. In Victoria he lived over the bank with a hired piano, and dressed for dinner. In Kamloops, horse country, he played polo. In the fall of 1904, the bank sent him to their Whitehorse branch in Yukon. With the expense money he bought himself a raccoon coat.\"\n\nThroughout this period, Service continued writing and saving his verses: \"more than a third of the poems in his first volume had been written before he moved north in 1904.\"\n\nWhitehorse was a frontier town, less than ten years old. Located on the Yukon River at the White Horse Rapids, it had begun in 1897 as a campground for prospectors on their way to Dawson City to join the Klondike Gold Rush. The railroad that Service rode in on, the White Pass and Yukon Route, had reached Whitehorse only in 1900.\n\nSettling in, \"Service dreamed and listened to the stories of the great gold rush.\" He also \"took part in the extremely active Whitehorse social life. As was popular at the time he recited at concerts – things like 'Casey at the Bat' and 'Gunga Din', but they were getting stale.\"\n\nOne day (Service later wrote), while pondering what to recite at an upcoming church concert he met E.J. \"Stroller\" White, editor of the \"Whitehorse Star\". White suggested: \"Why don’t you write a poem for it? Give us something about our own bit of earth. We sure would appreciate it. There’s a rich paystreak waiting for someone to work. Why don’t you go in and stake it?\"\n\nReturning from a walk one Saturday night, Service heard the sounds of revelry from a saloon, and the phrase \"A bunch of the boys were whooping it up\" popped into his head. Inspired, he ran to the bank to write it down (almost being shot as a burglar), and by the next morning \"The Shooting of Dan McGrew\" was complete.\n\n\"A month or so later he heard a gold rush yarn from a Dawson mining man about a fellow who cremated his pal.\" He spent the night walking in the woods composing \"The Cremation of Sam McGee\", and wrote it down from memory the next day.\n\nOther verses quickly followed. \"In the early spring he stood above the heights of Miles Canyon ... the line 'I have gazed on naked grandeur where there’s nothing else to gaze on' came into his mind and again he hammered out a complete poem, \"\". Conversations with locals led Service to write about things he had not seen (some of which had not actually happened) as well. He did not set foot in Dawson City until 1908, arriving in the Klondike ten years after the Gold Rush when his renown as a writer was already established.\n\nAfter having collected enough poems for a book, Service \"sent the poems to his father, who had emigrated to Toronto, and asked him to find a printing house so they could make it into a booklet. He enclosed a cheque to cover the costs and intended to give these booklets away to his friends in Whitehorse\" for Christmas. His father took the manuscript to William Briggs in Toronto, whose employees loved the book. \"The foreman and printers recited the ballads while they worked. A salesman read the proofs out loud as they came off the typesetting machines.\" An \"enterprising salesman sold 1700 copies in advance orders from galley proofs.\" The publisher \"sent Robert's cheque back to him and offered a ten percent royalty contract for the book.\"\n\nService's book, \"Songs of a Sourdough\", was \"an immediate success.\" It went through seven printings even before its official release date. Ultimately, Briggs \"sold fifteen impressions in 1907. That same year there was an edition in New York, Philadelphia, and London. The London publisher, T. Fisher Unwin, struck a twenty-third printing in 1910, and thirteen more by 1917.\" \"Service eventually earned in excess of $100,000 for \"Songs of a Sourdough\" alone\" (equal to about $ today after inflation).\n\n(In the United States, the book would be given the more Jack London-ish title, \"The Spell of the Yukon and Other Verses\").\n\n\"When copies of the book reached Whitehorse, Robert's own minister took him aside to let him know how wicked were his stories. Service hung his head in shame... But, that summer, tourists from the south arrived in Whitehorse looking for the famous poet; and he autographed many of his books.\"\n\n\"In 1908, after working for the bank for three years in Whitehorse, he was sent outside on mandatory paid leave for three months, a standard practice for bank employees serving in the Yukon.\" According to Enid Mallory, he went to Vancouver and looked up Constance MacLean. Now that he was a successful author, she agreed to become engaged to him.\n\nFollowing his leave, in 1908 the bank transferred Service to Dawson, where he met veterans of the Gold Rush, now ten years in the past: \"they loved to reminisce, and Robert listened carefully and remembered.\" He used their tales to write a second book of verse, \"Ballads of a Cheechako\", in 1908. \"It too was an overwhelming success.\"\n\nIn 1909, when the bank wanted Service to return to Whitehorse as manager, he decided to resign. \"After quitting his job, he rented a small two-room cabin on Eighth Avenue in Dawson City from Mrs. Edna Clarke and began his career as a full-time author.\" He immediately \"went to work on his novel... He went for walks that lasted all night, slept till mid-afternoon, and sometimes didn't come out of the cabin for days. In five months the novel, called \"The Trail of '98\", was complete and he took it to a publisher in New York.\" Service's first novel also \"immediately became a best-seller.\"\n\nNewly wealthy, Service was able to travel to Paris, the French Riviera, Hollywood, and beyond. He returned to Dawson City in 1912 to write his third book of poetry, \"Rhymes of a Rolling Stone\" (1912). During that time he became a freemason, being initiated into Yukon Lodge No. 45 in Dawson.\n\nIt is unclear what happened between Service and Constance MacLean as no known letters between them exist after Service's departure for Dawson City. In 1912 she \"married Leroy Grant, a surveyor and railroad engineer based in Prince Rupert.\"\n\nService left Dawson City for good in 1912. From 1912 to 1913 he was a correspondent for the \"Toronto Star\" during the Balkan Wars.\n\nIn 1913, Service moved to Paris, remaining there for the next 15 years. He settled in the Latin Quarter, posing as a painter. In June 1913, he married Parisienne Germaine Bourgoin, daughter of a distillery owner, and they purchased a summer home at Lancieux, Côtes-d'Armor, in the Brittany region of France. Thirteen years younger than her husband, Germaine Service survived him by 31 years, dying aged 102 in 1989.\n\nService was 41 when World War I broke out; he attempted to enlist, but was turned down \"due to varicose veins.\" He briefly covered the war for the \"Toronto Star\" (from December 11, 1915, through January 29, 1916), but \"was arrested and nearly executed in an outbreak of spy hysteria in Dunkirk.\" He then \"worked as a stretcher bearer and ambulance driver with the Ambulance Corps of the American Red Cross, until his health broke.\" Convalescing in Paris, he wrote a new book of mainly war poetry, \"Rhymes of a Red Cross Man\", in 1916. The book was dedicated to the memory of Service's \"brother, Lieutenant Albert Service, Canadian Infantry, Killed in Action, France, August 1916.\" Robert Service received three medals for his war service: 1914–15 Star, British War Medal and the Victory Medal.\n\nWith the end of the war, Service \"settled down to being a rich man in Paris... During the day he would promenade in the best suits, with a monocle. At night he went out in old clothes with the company of his doorman, a retired policeman, to visit the lowest dives of the city\". During his time in Paris he was reputedly the wealthiest author living in the city, yet was known to dress as a working man and walk the streets, blending in and observing everything around him. Those experiences would be used in his next book of poetry, \"Ballads of a Bohemian\" (1921): \"The poems are given in the persona of an American poet in Paris who serves as an ambulance driver and an infantryman in the war. The verses are separated by diary entries over a period of four years.\"\n\nIn the 1920s, Service began writing thriller novels. \"The Poisoned Paradise, A Romance of Monte Carlo\" (New York, 1922) and \"The Roughneck. A Tale of Tahiti\" (New York, 1923) were both later made into silent movies. During the winter season, Service used to live in Nice with his family, where he met British writers, including H.G. Wells, A.K. Bruce, Somerset Maugham, Rex Ingram, Franck Scully, James Joyce, Franck Harris, and Frieda Laurence, who all spent their winters in the French Riviera, and he wrote that he had been lucky to have had lunch with Colette.\n\nIn 1930, Service returned to Kilwinning, to erect a memorial to his family in the town cemetery. He also visited the USSR in the 1930s and later wrote a satirical \"Ballad of Lenin's Tomb\". For this reason his poetry was never translated into Russian in the USSR, and he was never mentioned in Soviet encyclopedias.\n\nService's second trip to the Soviet Union \"was interrupted by news of the Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact. Service fled across Poland, Latvia, Estonia and the Baltic to Stockholm. He wintered in Nice with his family, then fled France for Canada.\" Not long after, the Nazis invaded France, and \"arrived at his home in Lancieux ... looking specifically for the poet who had mocked Hitler in newspaper verse.\"\n\nDuring World War II, Service lived in California, \"and Hollywood had him join with other celebrities in helping the morale of troops – visiting US Army camps to recite his poems. He was also asked to play himself in the movie \"The Spoilers\" (1942), working alongside Marlene Dietrich, John Wayne and Randolph Scott. \"He was thrilled to play a scene with Marlene Dietrich.\" After the war, Service and his wife returned to his home in Brittany, to find it destroyed. They rebuilt, and he lived there until his death in 1958, though he wintered in Monte Carlo on the French Riviera. Service's wife and daughter, Iris, travelled to the Yukon in 1946 \"and visited Whitehorse and Dawson City, which by then was becoming a ghost town. Service could not bring himself to go back. He preferred to remember the town as it had been.\"\n\nService wrote prolifically during his last years, publishing six books of verse from 1949 to 1955. A book he had written in 1956 was published posthumously. In the spring of 1958, not long before Service died, Canadian broadcaster Pierre Berton recorded many hours of autobiographical television interview for the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation, in Service's Monte Carlo flat. At this occasion, Service recited The Shooting of Dan McGrew and The Cremation of Sam McGee \n\nService lived in Monaco from 1947 to 1958. He wrote two volumes of autobiography – \"Ploughman of the Moon\" (1945) and \"Harper of Heaven\" (1948). He died in Lancieux and is buried in the local cemetery.\n\nRobert Service wrote the most commercially successful poetry of the century. Yet his most popular works \"were considered doggerel by the literary set.\" During his lifetime, he was nicknamed \"the Canadian Kipling.\" – yet that may have been a double-edged compliment. As T. S. Eliot has said, \"we have to defend Kipling against the charge of excessive lucidity,\" \"the charge of being a 'journalist' appealing only to the commonest collective emotion,\" and \"the charge of writing jingles.\" All those charges, and more, could be levelled against Service's best known and best loved works. \n\nCertainly Service's verse was derivative of Kipling's. In \"The Cremation of Sam McGee\", for instance, he uses the form of Kipling's \"The Ballad of East and West\".\n\nIn his E. J. Pratt lecture \"Silence In the Sea,\" critic Northrop Frye argued that Service's verse was not \"serious poetry,\" but something else he called \"popular poetry\": \"the idioms of popular and serious poetry remain inexorably distinct.\" Popular poems, he thought, \"preserve a surface of explicit statement\" – either being \"proverbial, like Kipling's 'If' or Longfellow's 'Song of Life' or Burns's 'For A' That',\" or dealing in \"conventionally poetic themes, like the pastoral themes of James Whitcomb Riley, or the adventurous themes of Robert Service.\"\n\nService himself did not call his work poetry. \"Verse, not poetry, is what I was after ... something the man in the street would take notice of and the sweet old lady would paste in her album; something the schoolboy would spout and the fellow in the pub would quote. Yet I never wrote to please anyone but myself; it just happened. I belonged to the simple folks whom I liked to please.\"\n\nIn his autobiography, Service described his method of writing at his Dawson City cabin. \"I used to write on the coarse rolls of paper used by paper-hangers, pinning them on the wall and printing my verses in big charcoal letters. Then I would pace back and forth before them, repeating them, trying to make them perfect. I wanted to make them appeal to the eye as well as to the ear. I tried to avoid any literal quality.\"\n\nOne remarkable thing about both of Service's best-known ballads is how easily he wrote them. When writing about composing \"The Shooting of Dan McGrew\", 'easy' was exactly the word he used: \"For it came so easy to me in my excited state that I was amazed at my facility. It was as if someone was whispering in my ear.\" And this was just after someone had tried to shoot him. He continued: \"As I wrote stanza after stanza, the story seemed to evolve itself. It was a marvelous experience. Before I crawled into my bed at five in the morning, my ballad was in the bag.\"\n\nSimilarly, when he wrote \"The Cremation of Sam McGee\", the verses just flowed: \"I took the woodland trail, my mind seething with excitement and a strange ecstasy... As I started in: There are strange things done in the midnight sun, verse after verse developed with scarce a check ... and when I rolled happily into bed, my ballad was cinched. Next day, with scarcely any effort of memory I put it on paper.\"\n\nIn 1926, Archibald MacMechan, Professor of English at Canada's Dalhousie University, pronounced on Service's Yukon books in his \"Headwaters of Canadian Literature\":\n\nMacMechan did give grudging respect to Service's World War I poetry, conceding that his style went well with that subject, and that \"his \"Rhymes of a Red Cross Man\" are an advance on his previous volumes. He has come into touch with the grimmest of realities; and while his radical faults have not been cured, his rude lines drive home the truth that he has seen.\"\n\nReviewing Service's \"Rhymes of a Rebel\" in 1952, Frye remarked that the book \"interests me chiefly because ... I have noticed so much verse in exactly the same idiom, and I wonder how far Mr. Service's books may have influenced it. There was a time, fifty years ago,\" he added,\" when Robert W.Service represented, with some accuracy, the general level of poetic experience in Canada, as far as the popular reader was concerned... there has been a prodigious, and, I should think, a permanent, change in public taste.\"\n\nService has also been noted for his use of ethnonyms that would normally be considered offensive \"slurs\", but with no insult apparently intended. Words used in Service's poetry include \"jerries\" (Germans), \"dago\" (Italian), \"pickaninny\" (in reference to a Mozambican infant), \"cheechako\" (newcomer to the Yukon and Alaska gold fields, usually from the U.S.), \"nigger\" (black person), \"squaw\" (Aboriginal woman), and \"Jap\" (Japanese).\n\nRobert W. Service has been honoured with schools named for him including Robert Service High School in Anchorage, Alaska, Robert Service Senior Public School (Middle/ Jr. High) in Toronto, Ontario and Robert Service School in Dawson City.\n\nHe was also honoured on a Canadian postage stamp in 1976. The Robert Service Way, a main road in Whitehorse, is named after him.\n\nAdditionally, the Bard & Banker public house in Victoria is dedicated to him, the building having at one time been a Canadian Bank of Commerce branch where Service was employed while residing in the city.\n\nService's first novel, \"The Trail of '98\", was made into a movie by Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer, directed by Clarence Brown. \"\"Trail of '98\" starring Dolores del Río, Ralph Forbes and Karl Dane in 1929 ... was the first talking picture dealing with the Klondike gold rush and was acclaimed at the time by critics for depicting the Klondike as it really was.\"\n\nIn 1968 Canadian-born country singer Hank Snow recorded recitations of eight of Service's longer poems for an album entitled Tales of the Yukon. The album was released by RCA Victor. Snow and other musicians including Chet Atkins and Chubby Wise provided background music.\n\nFolksinger Country Joe McDonald set some of Service's World War I poetry (plus \"The March of the Dead\" from his first book), to music for his 1971 studio album, \"War War War\".\n\nThe Canadian whiskey Yukon Jack incorporated various excerpts of his writings in their ads in the 1970s, one of which was the first four lines of his poem, \"The Men Who Don't Fit In\".\n\nThe town of Lancieux, where he used to come every summer, organized several recognitions to the memory of Robert W. Service. One of the streets of Lancieux has been called Robert Service Street. On July 13, 1990, a commemorative tablet was unveiled at the Lancieux Office du Tourisme by the daughter of the poet: Iris Service. An evening of celebration was organized afterwards with a dinner attended by many guests from Scotland and the Yukon. A few years later, on May 18, 2002 the school of Lancieux in Brittany took the name of \"École Robert W. Service\". Charlotte Service-Longépé the great granddaughter and the granddaughter of the poet attended the dedication ceremony and made a speech. Since 2000, the towns of Lancieux and Whitehorse are sister cities, due to Robert W. Service's life and work in both places.\n\nRadio humorist and raconteur Jean Shepherd recorded a collection of Robert Service's poems, \"Jean Shepherd Reads the Poems of Robert Service\".\n\nMargaret Rutherford recited most of \"The Shooting of Dan McGrew\" in the 1964 Ealing Studios film \"Murder Most Foul\".\n\nRobert Service lived from 1909 to 1912 in a small two-room cabin on 8th Avenue which he rented from Edna Clarke in Dawson City. His prosperity allowed him the luxury of a telephone. Service eventually decided he could not return to Dawson, as it would not be as he remembered it. He wrote in his autobiography:\n\nAfter Service left for Europe, the Imperial Order of the Daughters of the Empire (I.O.D.E.) took care of the cabin until 1971, preserving it. In 1971 it was taken over by Parks Canada, which maintains it, including its sod roof, as a tourist attraction.\n\nIrish-born actor Tom Byrne created \"The Robert Service Show\" which was presented in the front yard of the cabin, starting in 1976. This was very popular for summer visitors and set the standard for Robert Service recitations. A resurgence in sales of Service's works followed the institution of these performances. Byrne discontinued the show at the cabin in 1995, moving it to a Front Street storefront. Since 2004 the show has been held at the Westmark Hotel in Dawson City during the summer months.\n\nAt the Service Cabin, local Dawson entertainers dressed in period costumes and employed by Parks Canada offer biographical information and recite Service's poetry for visitors.\n\nBest of Robert Service by Hancock House Publishers\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

They were descendants of Orfitus who was adopted by Servius Cornelius Scipio, an otherwise unknown member of the patrician branch of the Cornelii Scipiones. \n\nThere were at least six members of this family who used this name, all direct male descendants of the earliest known member of this branch, the consul of 51. Except for the first two generations, little is known about any of them.\n\nServius Cornelius Scipio Salvidienus Orfitus was ordinary consul in AD 51 as the colleague of the emperor Claudius. He was one of the victims of the \"delator\" Marcus Aquilius Regulus during the reign of Nero.\n\nServius Cornelius Scipio Salvidienus Orfitus was a suffect consul in some year prior to 87; his colleague has not been identified. He was the son of the consul of AD 51. He was also a victim of imperial suspicion, and was first banished to an island by the emperor Domitian then later executed.\n\nServius Cornelius Scipio Salvidienus Orfitus was ordinary consul in AD 110 as the colleague of Marcus Peducaeus Priscinus. He was the son of the previous Orfitus. The only other fact known of his life is that he was Urban prefect of Rome during the reign of Antoninus Pius.\n\nServius Cornelius Scipio Salvidienus Orfitus is known through inscriptions to have been proconsul of Africa in 163/164. From this it can be inferred that this Orfitus was suffect consul around 146. It is assumed he was the son of the consul of 110.\n\nIt was assumed at one point that this Orfitus was also the ordinary consul of 149, but more recent research has identified that Orfitus as Lucius Sergius Salvidienus Scipio Orfitus, a member of the \"gens Sergia\".\n\nServius Cornelius Scipio Salvidienus Orfitus was ordinary consul in AD 178 with Decimus Velius Rufus as his colleague.

It is assumed he was the son of the previous Orfitus. There is no record of this Orfitus acceding to the consulate; while this may indicate that he died before the age of 31 or 32, the earliest point a Patrician could be a consul, attestations of suffect consul become much more scarce after 180 and evidence of his consulate simply has yet to be recovered.\n"}

Prosecutors had charged that Kim's actions indirectly alerted North Korea to what U.S. intelligence officials \"knew or did not know about its military capabilities and preparedness.\"\n\nHe was born on August 15, 1967, in Seoul, South Korea. His family moved to New York in 1976. He attended Fordham Preparatory School, a Jesuit school. For college he went to the Georgetown University School of Foreign Service (1989). He tried out Wall Street but found the work did not suit him. Following that, he attended Harvard for a master's degree in national security (1992), and then Yale for a Ph.D. in diplomatic and military history (1999). He authored a book based on his dissertation. He has also extensively studied philosophy and literature.\n\nAfter graduation, he went to work at the Center for Naval Analyses, where he analyzed US operations in Kosovo, Afghanistan, and Iraq. After the September 11 attacks, he moved to the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory where he focused on North Korea. He briefed the Defense Policy Board on his work as well as Henry Kissinger, Stephen Hadley, and Dick Cheney. He also worked at the Office of Net Assessment under the Secretary of Defense, analyzing Chinese nuclear issues.\n\nIn 2008, he went to work as a contractor at the State Department at the Bureau of Arms Control, Verification and Compliance. There, he was Senior Advisor for Intelligence to the Assistant Secretary of State for Verification, Compliance, and Implementation. He studied North Korea's nuclear program, especially its claims of dismantling its equipment. He also participated in nuclear war games at the Naval War College.\n\nIn June 2009, Kim allegedly had a conversation with Rosen about North Korea planning a nuclear bomb test.\n\nIn August 2010, Kim was indicted by a grand jury on two charges:\n\n\nThe government alleges that Kim's conversation with Rosen contained information related to the \"national defense\" (793(d) does not use the word \"classified\"). The alleged false statements to the FBI occurred in September 2009, regarding whether or not Kim had any contact with Rosen (whom he allegedly met around March 2009).\n\nKim initially pleaded not guilty. Rosen and Fox were not named in the indictment (which listed them as a \"reporter\" and a \"news organization\"), but news reports identified the parties.\n\nKim was defended by prominent attorneys Abbe Lowell of Chadbourne & Parke and Paul M. Thompson and James M. Commons of McDermott Will & Emery. One of Lowell's arguments was that Bob Woodward's book \"Obama's Wars\" contains far more sensitive information than the information Kim is accused of leaking, which created a double standard in leak prosecution.

Ratana\n\nTahupōtiki Wiremu Rātana (25 January 1873? – 18 September 1939) was the founder of the Rātana religion in the early 20th century in New Zealand. He rose to prominence as a faith healer.\n\nRātana was of the Ngati Apa and Ngā Wairiki iwi — his subtribes were Nga Ariki, Ngāti Hikapirau, Ngāti Rangiwaho, Ngāti Kiriwheke and Ngati Kauae. On his mother's side he was of Ngā Rauru Kiitahi, his mother belonging to the Rangitaawhi Hapū.\n\nHe married Te Urumanao Ngāpaki Baker, who had whakapapa links to the Ngāti Ruanui, and possibly Te Āti Awa also.\n\nRātana began his spiritual mission during the 1918 influenza epidemic. He claimed that while standing on the veranda of his home at 2pm, on 8 November 1918, three days before the end of the First World War, he saw a small cloud coming in from the sea toward his house. When the cloud 'broke open' he was overwhelmed by a presence and he rushed into the house declaring 'Peace be unto you all, for I am the Holy Spirit that speaks to you all. Straighten yourselves. Repent.' He was told the Holy Spirit was looking for a people through whom God could be truly known and accepted. The Māori people had not forgotten Jehovah and so they had been chosen to become an example to the world if only they would turn from their dependence on tohungaism (particularly the manipulative forms of witchcraft) and Maori gods. Rātana was told to unite the Māori and turn them to Ihoa o nga Mano (Jehovah of the Multitudes).\n\nHe continued his study of the Bible and began one of the most powerful faith healing ministries in New Zealand history. He gained a large following among Māori, becoming known as \"Mangai\" (a mouthpiece of God). A splinter group, called the Christian Maramatanga Society, formed in the mid-1920s when they misinterpreted Rātana's call to 'close the Bible' in order to stop fanciful prophecies.\n\nVariants of his name include Tahupōtiki Wiremu Rātana, Tahu Pōtiki Wiremu Rātana and T. W. Rātana.\n\nFrom 1922 onwards the Rātana movement became increasingly occupied with politics. The movement campaigned for ratification of the Treaty of Waitangi as a \"cure-all\" for Māori problems and collected 30,000 signatures on a petition calling for this. In 1928 Rātana proclaimed that Rātana candidates would win the four Māori seats in the Parliament of New Zealand, likening them to the four parts of his body, or the Four Quarters, as the seats became known. Eruera Tirikatene arranged a meeting with Michael J. Savage in Parliament on 4 February 1936 at which an alliance with the Labour Party was agreed. Savage's predecessor Harry Holland had been reluctant, because of the animosity between Rātana and the Māori King Movement, especially Princess Te Puea. By 1943, the seats had been won, although Rātana had died in 1939.\n\nThe Rātana Church remains one of the largest churches in Māori. The political links with the Labour Party remained strong for over 40 years, but were effectively divided by the rise of the Māori Party, which was founded in 2004 and came to power in a confidence and supply agreement (with the National Party, Labour's traditional rival) after the 2008 election.\n\n"}
