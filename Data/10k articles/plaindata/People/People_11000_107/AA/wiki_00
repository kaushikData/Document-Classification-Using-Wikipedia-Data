{"id": "1435357", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1435357", "title": "André Messager", "text": "André Messager\n\nAndré Charles Prosper Messager (; 30 December 1853 – 24 February 1929) was a French composer, organist, pianist and conductor. His compositions include eight ballets and thirty opéras comiques, opérettes and other stage works, among which his ballet \"Les Deux Pigeons\" (1886) and opéra comique \"Véronique\" (1898) have had lasting success; \"Les P'tites Michu\" (1897) and \"Monsieur Beaucaire\" (1919) were also popular internationally.\n\nMessager took up the piano as a small child and later studied composition with, among others, Camille Saint-Saëns and Gabriel Fauré. He became a major figure in the musical life of Paris and later London, both as a conductor and a composer. Many of his Parisian works were also produced in the West End and some on Broadway; the most successful had long runs and numerous international revivals. He wrote two operatic works in English, and his later output included musical comedies for Sacha Guitry and Yvonne Printemps.\n\nAs a conductor, Messager held prominent positions in Paris and London, at the head of the Opéra-Comique, the Paris Opéra, the Orchestre de la Société des Concerts du Conservatoire, and the Royal Opera House, Covent Garden. Although as a composer he is known chiefly for his light works, as a conductor he presented a wide range of operas, from Mozart to Richard Strauss, and he acquired a reputation as a conductor of Wagner. In Paris he conducted the world premieres of Debussy's \"Pelléas et Mélisande\", Massenet's \"Grisélidis\" and Charpentier's \"Louise\". At Covent Garden, he gave the British premieres of operas by Saint-Saëns and Massenet.\n\nMessager's music became known for its melodic and orchestral invention, musical craftsmanship, and characteristically French elegance and grace. Although most of his works have been infrequently revived, historians of music consider him the last major figure in French opéra comique and opérette.\n\nMessager was born at Montluçon in central France on 30 December 1853, the son of Paul-Philippe-Émile Messager, a prosperous local tax collector, and his wife Sophie-Cornélie, \"née\" Lhôte de Selancy. He recalled, \"You would not find any musicians among my ancestors. When very young I learned the piano; but later on my intentions to become a composer met with such opposition from my father\". At the age of seven he was sent as a boarder to a Marist school where he continued his interest in the piano.\n\nTowards the end of the 1860s disastrous stock-market speculation brought Messager's family financial ruin and they could no longer afford to keep him at the Marist school. They dropped their objection to music as a profession, viewing a post as a church organist as a respectable and steady career. He was awarded a bursary to study at the École Niedermeyer in Paris, an academy known for its focus on church music. This was at the time of the Paris Commune (1871), and to escape the violence in the city the school was temporarily evacuated to Switzerland. Messager studied piano with Adam Lausset, organ with Clément Loret, and composition with Eugène Gigout, Gabriel Fauré and (after leaving Niedermeyer's school) Camille Saint-Saëns. The musicologist Jean-Michel Nectoux comments that after his studies Messager developed into one of the finest orchestrators of the period.\n\nFauré and Messager quickly moved from being master and pupil to being firm friends and occasional collaborators. In 1874 Messager succeeded Fauré as \"organiste du chœur\" (choir organist) at Saint-Sulpice, Paris, under the principal organist, Charles-Marie Widor. In 1876 he won the gold medal of the Société des Auteurs, Compositeurs et Editeurs de Musique with a symphony, the work being warmly received when performed by the Concerts Colonne at the Théâtre du Châtelet in January 1878. He won further prizes for his cantatas \"Don Juan et Haydée\" and \"Prométhée enchaîné\".\n\nIn 1879 Fauré and Messager travelled to Cologne to see Wagner's \"Das Rheingold\" and \"Die Walküre\", and later to Munich for the complete \"Ring\" cycle, \"Die Meistersinger von Nürnberg\" and \"Tannhäuser\"; in 1888 they went to Bayreuth for \"Die Meistersinger\" and \"Parsifal\". They frequently performed as a party piece their joint composition, the irreverent \"Souvenirs de Bayreuth\" (c. 1888). This short, skittish piano work for four hands burlesques motifs from \"The Ring\". The two composers had a more serious collaboration, their \"Messe des pêcheurs de Villerville\" (1881).\n\nIn 1878 Messager was appointed conductor at the Folies Bergère, and he began his career composing for the stage with two short ballets, \"Fleur d'oranger\" (1878) and \"Les Vins de France\" (1879). In 1880 a former manager of the Folies, M. Comy, was appointed to run the new Eden Théâtre in Brussels. At his invitation, Messager resigned from the Folies in 1880 and became conductor of the Eden. He returned to Paris in 1881 as organist of Saint-Paul-Saint-Louis church, and from 1882 to 1884 he was organist and choirmaster at Ste Marie-des-Batignolles, a small church in the north west of Paris, where his assistant was another young composer, Claude Terrasse.\n\nMessager's career took a new turn in 1883 when the composer Firmin Bernicat died leaving an unfinished opérette, \"François les bas-bleus\". Messager was invited to complete it; he orchestrated the entire work and composed between twelve and fifteen numbers. It was staged in November 1883 at the Théâtre des Folies-Dramatiques and was an immediate critical and popular success. It was later produced in London and New York. In 1883, while deputising for Saint-Saëns as the soloist at a concert in Le Havre, Messager met a young woman, Edith Clouette, whom he married in the same year. Fauré played the organ at the ceremony, and composed a mildly cynical song, \"Madrigal\", as a wedding present. There was one child of the marriage, Jean André Emile Charles (1886–1952).\n\nIn December 1883 Messager and Emmanuel Chabrier gave the first performance of the latter's \"Trois valses romantiques\" at the Société Nationale de Musique. The concert also included the premiere of the two-piano version of \"España\", arranged by Messager. Messager and Chabrier were close friends until the latter's death in 1894. Both were known for their comic operas and opérettes, but Chabrier's one serious opera, \"Gwendoline\", appealed strongly to Messager, who vowed to conduct it in Paris, which he later did. He also prepared a piano reduction of the orchestral parts for the vocal score of the work.\n\nFollowing the success of \"François les bas-bleus\" Messager accepted simultaneous invitations to compose a ballet for the Opéra and an opérette for the Folies-Dramatiques. The opérette, \"La Fauvette du temple\", first performed on 17 November 1885, confirmed Messager's early reputation. It ran well into the following year in Paris, and he was able to sell the British rights immediately, though the work was not staged in London until 1891. The ballet, \"Les Deux Pigeons\", which became one of Messager's best known works, took longer to reach the stage. It was put into rehearsal at the Opéra, but the staging, which showed a tree being struck by lightning in a storm scene, was considered a fire hazard by the police, and the production was temporarily shelved.\n\nA month after the opening of \"La Fauvette du temple\" the Bouffes-Parisiens premiered Messager's opéra comique \"La Béarnaise\", with Jeanne Granier in the title role. It ran for three months and was successfully produced in Britain the following year with a cast including Florence St. John and Marie Tempest, running for more than 200 performances. \"The Times\" said of this production that it gave Messager a secure footing in London, which led to important results later in his career. A production of \"La Béarnaise\" in New York followed in 1887, under the title \"Jacquette\".\n\nIn 1886 \"Les Deux Pigeons\" was finally produced at the Paris Opéra and was a box office triumph. It was Messager's last popular success for four years. His attempt at a more serious opera, \"Le Bourgeois de Calais\" (1888), was not well received. Richard Traubner remarks in \"Operetta: A Theatrical History\" on its \"boring historical plot, bad lyrics, and a banal score\"; a contemporary critic wrote, \"That \"Le Bourgeois de Calais\" will have a successful career there is not the faintest chance, for all the patriotic bolstering in the world could not make it an attractive piece.\" Messager followed this with a musical fairy tale, \"Isoline\" (1888), which was slightly better received, and a three-act opérette, \"Le Mari de la reine\" (1889), which failed, although Messager thought it \"the best of my flops\".\n\nMessager's fortunes revived in 1890 with \"La Basoche\", produced with much success at the Opéra-Comique. The critic who had pronounced so unfavourably on \"Le Bourgeois de Calais\" wrote of the new piece, \"an exceptionally pleasing work ... a dainty piece which cannot fail to obtain widespread popularity.\" An English-language version was produced in London in 1891 by Richard D'Oyly Carte. The theatrical newspaper \"The Era\" said, \"\"The Basoche\" is more than a success; it is a triumph\", but the piece had only a modest London run of three months. A New York production was given in 1893 but was not a success.\n\nMessager was a dandy and a philanderer. The musical historian D. Kern Holoman describes him as \"given to immaculately tailored suits emphasizing his thin frame, careful grooming with particular attention to his mustaches, fine jewelry, and spats ... a witty conversationalist with an inexhaustible store of anecdotes and \"bons mots\" and a womaniser. In the early 1890s Edith Messager, tired of her husband's infidelities, divorced him. Shortly afterwards she became ill; her condition deteriorated, and Messager visited her daily. By the time of her death in 1892 the two had become close again, and Messager felt her loss deeply.\n\nIn 1892 Messager's career as a conductor began to advance when he was invited to conduct \"Die Walküre\" at Marseille. As a composer the early 1890s brought him mixed fortunes. \"Madame Chrysanthème\", staged at the Théâtre de la Renaissance in 1893, was a setting of Pierre Loti's story of a betrayed geisha, a theme that later inspired Puccini's \"Madama Butterfly\"; it was politely rather than enthusiastically received. \"Mirette\", produced by Carte at the Savoy Theatre in 1894, was Messager's first opera written expressly for the London stage and was the only original Savoy opera by a French composer. To assist him in what was for him (at the time) an unfamiliar idiom, Messager enlisted the help of the songwriter Dotie (Alice Maude) Davis (1859–1938), known professionally as Hope Temple. She became Messager's second wife in 1895. According to Bernard Shaw, Messager, concluding from the reception of \"La Basoche\" in London that it was unwise to offer the British public anything too intelligent, decided that the new opera was going to be as commonplace as possible. It ran for 41 performances, was withdrawn and revised, and then ran for another 61 performances. Messager vetoed any production in Paris. His next opera, a serious work, \"Le Chevalier d'Harmental\" (1896), was unsuccessful, and for a while he and his new wife withdrew to the English countryside near Maidenhead, Berkshire.\nFrom 1897 Messager's career revived. He later recalled that he had received by post an unsolicited libretto:\n\nThis was the opérette \"Les P'tites Michu\", which was presented to great acclaim at the Bouffes-Parisiens. Its 1905 English adaptation in London ran for 401 performances. Soon afterwards he was appointed musical director of the Opéra-Comique, and in the commercial theatre had another outstanding success with \"Véronique\" (1898).\n\nIn 1898 Messager's only child from his second marriage, Madeleine Hope Andrée (d. 1986) was born. From that year to 1904 Messager's work at the Opéra-Comique left him little time for composition, particularly after 1901, when he also spent May to July at the Royal Opera House in London. He turned down W. S. Gilbert's offer of a collaboration, and wrote only two stage works between 1898 and 1914. His international fame as a composer nevertheless grew, with productions of \"Les P'tites Michu\" and \"Véronique\" in countries including Britain, Spain, Switzerland, Germany and the US. Unusually for the London stage at the time, \"Véronique\" was given in French in 1903. An English translation was staged the following year and ran for 496 performances. Messager conducted the first nights of both productions. The English version was staged in New York the following year, running for 81 performances.\n\nAt the Opéra-Comique, Messager conducted the premieres of Massenet's \"Grisélidis\" and Charpentier's \"Louise\", and gave the first French performances of operas as contrasted as \"Hansel and Gretel\" and \"Tosca\". But by far the best known of his premieres was Debussy's \"Pelléas et Mélisande\" (1902). Messager encouraged the composer to complete the opera and worked closely with him in getting the orchestration ready for the premiere. In gratitude Debussy dedicated the work to Messager. Holoman writes, \"his championing of \"Pelléas et Mélisande\" alone would have earned him a place in music history.\" Debussy regarded Messager as the ideal conductor. Before the premiere he had trusted him to \"make his dream into a reality\"; after it he praised him for knowing \"how to awaken the inner sound world of \"Pelléas\" with tender delicacy\". After Messager's commitments obliged him to leave Paris for London, Debussy found the performances much less satisfactory. As a conductor, Messager won praise on both sides of the English Channel. The English music critic Francis Toye wrote that, good though Arturo Toscanini's conducting of \"Pelléas et Mélisande\" was at La Scala in Milan, Messager's was still better. The Parisian critic Pierre Lalo said of Messager:\n\nFrom 1901 to 1907 Messager was one of the directors of the Grand Opera Syndicate, which ran the annual seasons at the Royal Opera House, Covent Garden, featuring the leading singers of the day, including Nellie Melba and Enrico Caruso. Much of his time was spent on administration, and he had limited scope for conducting. From 1901, for two years, Messager had an affair with the Scottish soprano Mary Garden, whom he met at the Opéra-Comique and conducted when she took over the title role of \"Louise\". She also appeared in a revival of his \"Madame Chrysanthème\". His first appearance as a conductor at Covent Garden was in 1902 for the first performance of \"Princess Osra\" by Herbert Bunning. He next conducted there in 1904 in the British premiere of Saint-Saëns's \"Hélène\", followed in 1905 by \"Carmen\", \"Don Giovanni\", \"Faust\", the world première of Franco Leoni's \"L'oracolo\", \"Orphée et Euridice\" and \"Roméo et Juliette\"; in his final year, 1906, he conducted \"Armide\", \"Carmen\", \"Don Giovanni\", \"Faust\", the British premiere of \"Le Jongleur de Notre-Dame\", and \"Roméo et Juliette\". In 1906 he also introduced to Covent Garden his ballet \"Les Deux Pigeons.\" Despite his reputation as a Wagnerian, he yielded the baton for Wagner performances to Hans Richter, widely regarded as the world's foremost exponent of Wagner's music. In 1906 Messager and the London Symphony Orchestra travelled to Paris to play a programme of English music at the Châtelet Theatre, including works by Sullivan, Parry and Stanford. When he left Covent Garden in 1907, the directors found it necessary to appoint two people to fill his place: Neil Forsyth as general manager and Percy Pitt as musical director.\nIn 1907 Messager returned to composition. His \"comédie lyrique\" \"Fortunio\" was presented at the Opéra-Comique with great success. In the same year he was appointed joint director of the Paris Opéra, responsible for the artistic direction, with Frederick Broussan, formerly director of the Lyons Opera, taking charge of administration. The partnership lasted until 1913, but its success was hampered by shortage of funds and internal disputes. Messager decided on a policy of making the Opéra \"more genuinely French\". He revived Rameau's \"Hippolyte et Aricie\", for the first time in Paris since 1767, and presented unusual French repertoire including Fauré's \"Pénélope\". Foreign opera was not neglected; Messager gave Paris its first complete \"Ring\" cycle, presented a Russian season starring Félia Litvinne and Feodor Chaliapin, and conducted the French premiere of Richard Strauss's \"Salome\". At the invitation of the Emperor Wilhelm II, Messager and Broussan took the Opéra company to Berlin in 1908. Relations between the two co-directors were not always harmonious; after the French government refused Messager's resignation on at least one occasion, he finally announced it in November 1913, a year before his term of office was due to expire. He consented to return in January 1914 to conduct \"Parsifal\" – its first performance in Europe outside Bayreuth. His conducting of the work won critical praise.\n\nOn the strength of his experience as a Wagnerian, Messager was appointed conductor of the Orchestre de la Société des Concerts du Conservatoire in 1908. It was at the time, and for many years, the most prestigious symphony orchestra in France, and Messager was determined that it should enjoy the international prestige of the Vienna and Berlin Philharmonic Orchestras. Alongside the main orchestral repertoire of Haydn, Mozart, Beethoven, Liszt and French classics, Messager conducted major choral works by J. S. Bach, Handel, Schumann and Berlioz, as well as introducing early French music such as that of Janequin. In the 1913–14 season, he conducted a chronological cycle of Beethoven's symphonies and his \"Missa solemnis\", as well as Verdi's \"Requiem\", for the Italian composer's centenary. Messager took the orchestra outside Paris to Lille, Lyon and Antwerp during these years. During the First World War he took the orchestra on tour to Argentina (1916), Switzerland (1917), and the US and Canada (1918–19), giving concerts in more than 50 cities. After their concert at the Metropolitan Opera House in October 1918, the orchestra and Messager received a prolonged ovation that was typical of their reception as the tour progressed. At the end of that tour Messager retired from his post.\n\nMessager was criticised for performing the music of Wagner during the war, but he maintained that German music represented the noble side of the enemy nation's nature. Like Fauré, Messager refused to have anything to do with the National League for the Defence of French Music (La Ligue Nationale pour la Defense de la Musique Française), led by Saint-Saëns, which sought to boycott German music.\n\nIn 1914 Messager composed \"Béatrice\", described as a \"légende lyrique\", based on the 1911 play \"The Miracle\". The premiere was in Monte Carlo. The work was performed in Paris in 1917 but was not successful. In 1915 Messager joined with other musicians in contributing compositions to \"King Albert's Book\" to raise money for \"the relief of the suffering Belgian people\"; the other composers included Debussy, Elgar, Mascagni and Saint-Saëns.\nIn 1919 Messager's operetta \"Monsieur Beaucaire\" was premiered in Birmingham prior to a long run in the West End. The composer, who generally conducted British premieres of his works, was suffering from sciatica and could not even be in the audience for the first nights in either city. The work received its Paris premiere at the Théâtre Marigny in 1925, and it ran for 143 performances on Broadway. Later in 1919 Messager resumed the musical directorship of the Opéra-Comique for the 1919–20 season, conducting among other works the first complete performance in France of \"Così fan tutte\".\n\nIn the 1920s, Messager kept pace with the change in fashion in musical theatre, consciously absorbing the styles of musical comedy, lightening his orchestration, but maintaining a Gallic flavour, mostly avoiding American dance-rhythm influences. He collaborated with Sacha Guitry on the musical comedies \"L'Amour masqué\" (1923) and \"Deburau\" (1926), starring Yvonne Printemps. The former was a considerable success in Paris, but in London the official censor, the Lord Chamberlain, declared it \"unfit for the English public\", and banned C. B. Cochran's planned production starring Printemps and Guitry. In Messager's late stage works his lighter touch was balanced by echoes of the nineteenth century, with hints of Fauré and, particularly, Chabrier's \"L'Étoile\". Fauré, by 1923 too frail and deaf to go to the theatre, was lent a copy of the score of \"L'Amour masqué\" and wrote to Messager, \"Your wit is the same as always – it never grows old – and so are your charm and very personal brand of music that always remains exquisite even amid the broadest clowning\". Fauré died the following year, and Messager dedicated the music of \"Deburau\" to his memory.\n\nIn 1924 Sergei Diaghilev persuaded Messager to conduct the Paris premieres of Auric's ballet \"Les Fâcheux\" and Poulenc's \"Les Biches\". In 1928 Messager played a key role in establishing important updates to copyright law, though he was on the losing side of the case. He sued the BBC for breach of copyright for broadcasting his works without his consent. He lost because he had assigned his British performing rights to George Edwardes, whose estate had given the BBC permission for the broadcast. The case established that as the broadcasting rights had not been specifically reserved, the Edwardes estate's rights included them.\n\nAfter a short illness Messager died in Paris on 24 February 1929 aged 75. He was interred in the Passy Cemetery near the graves of Debussy and Fauré. His last completed work, the opérette \"Coups de roulis\", was running in Paris when he died. A contemporary critic commented, \"Its tuneful melodies show that the veteran composer had lost nothing of the qualities that made \"Véronique\" such a success. Throughout his life Messager remained without a peer as a composer of light music.\"\n\nMessager was elected President of the Société des Auteurs et Compositeurs Dramatiques in 1926, the first composer to hold this office. In the same year he was elected to the Académie des Beaux-Arts. In 1927 he was appointed Commander of the Légion d'honneur. In his native town of Montluçon, the music academy, opened in 2009, is named in his honour. In 2003, to mark the 150th anniversary of his birth, Messager was the subject of a large exhibition at the Musée des musiques populaires de Montluçon, recounting his biography and illustrating his works in the various genres. Among the \"comité d'honneur\" of the exhibition were the composer's three grandchildren, and the singers Susan Graham, Dame Felicity Lott and Mady Mesplé, the conductors Sir John Eliot Gardiner, John Nelson and Michel Plasson, and the director Jérôme Savary.\n\nIn his 1991 study of Messager, John Wagstaff writes that the composer's music is notable for its fine orchestration, easy-flowing melody, and skilfully written music, dance-like in character. Unlike his teacher Fauré, Messager enjoyed orchestrating. He said that musical ideas came to him \"already clothed in the appropriate instrumental shades\", and after the concentrated effort of composing his scores he found it relaxing to work on \"the handling of instruments, the balancing of different sonorities, the grouping of colours and the structuring of effects\". He remarked that composers who had their music orchestrated by assistants presumably did not care if their helpers lacked \"that indefinable sixth sense which would indicate the right combination of sonorities to carry out the original intentions of the composer\". To Messager, passages often depended for their significance or flavour on the orchestral writing alone.\n\nGervase Hughes, in a study of French opérette, comments that Messager's only technical defect was \"one all too common to many composers of operetta – too close an adherence to repetitive rhythmic figures and four-bar rigidity\", although such was Messager's \"innate artistry that criticism on that score would be academic pedantry\". One of the composer's distinguishing characteristics was a liking for chromaticism; this appealed to a younger generation of composers. His \"Eh que ne parliez-vous?\", from \"La Basoche\", was quoted note-for-note by Poulenc in \"Les Mamelles de Tirésias\". Although Messager greatly admired Wagner, and was a celebrated conductor of his music, he distanced himself from Wagnerian influences in his own compositions. In \"Madame Chrysanthème\" he made use of leitmotifs, and included other references to Wagner, but such examples are rare in his works.\n\nUnlike some older contemporaries such as Saint-Saëns and Massenet, Messager remained open to new ideas and idioms throughout his life, and his style evolved to match the spirit of the times. His biographer and former pupil Henry Février commented that from classic opéras comiques, such as \"La Basoche\", Messager's later works, such as \"Les P'tites Michu\" and \"Véronique\", show a difference in style, \"bringing an altogether fresher approach to the genre.\" Towards the end of his career Messager successfully moved to \"comédie musical\", the French form of musical comedy.\nBallets apart, Messager composed thirty works for the stage; they fall into several different, or sometimes overlapping, genres; the most numerous are opéras comiques (9), opérettes (7) and comédies musicales (3). The composer remarked late in his career:\n\nAlthough Messager called some of his early stage works opéras comiques they have, Gervase Hughes suggests, more in common with opérette than their composer acknowledged. Nevertheless, Messager introduced adventurous modern harmonic details in his early pieces, and strove to raise the artistic standards of opérette to that of opéra comique while retaining the essential panache of the genre. Hughes finds the first stage works uneven in quality but \"La Fauvette du temple\" (1884) to contain two fine expressive duets as well as waltzes and polkas with \"an Offenbach lilt\". Hughes judges the next two scores, \"La Béarnaise\" and \"La Fauvette\" (both 1885), less satisfying but nonetheless at least as good as anything by Messager's older contemporaries Planquette, Serpette and Lecocq.\n\nWagstaff writes that the composer's most enduring work is the ballet score \"Les Deux Pigeons\" (1886). The piece is based on the fable \"The Two Pigeons\" by Jean de La Fontaine. The music is best known in the five-movement suite arranged from the full score, which includes the \"Entrée de tziganes\". Messager revived the ballet in 1906 in London and in 1912 in Paris in a shortened, two-act version. In 1961 John Lanchbery revised this for Frederick Ashton's new version of the ballet, with a closing reconciliation scene from earlier music and a passage transcribed from \"Véronique\". This was first given at Covent Garden, is revived regularly by the Royal Ballet and has been staged by such other companies as CAPAB and Australian Ballet.\n\n\"Isoline\" (1888), a musical fairy story (\"conte des fées\"), is neither an opérette nor an opéra comique. Writing in 1908, Fauré called it \"one of the most poetic, most expressive works that have been written in France in the last twenty years\", but it made little impact. The score remained in obscurity until 1930 when Reynaldo Hahn staged the ballet section of the work at Cannes. The whole piece was revived at the Opéra-Comique in 1958; it failed again, but the ballet, unencumbered by the portentousness of the libretto, which weighs down the rest of the piece, has remained in the repertory.\n\nThe decade began well for Messager with the artistic and commercial success of \"La Basoche\" (1890). Février in his \"André Messager: Mon Maître, Mon Ami\" calls it \"the last of the great nineteenth-century French comic operas\" (\"le dernier des grands opéras-comique français du XIX siècle\") and considers it of the greatest importance not only in Messager's career but in the history of French musical theatre. Hughes says it has a good claim to be the composer's masterpiece. The musicologist James Harding rates it \"the best Messager had written to date ... one of his finest works\". When the work was given in London, a year after its Parisian premiere, the reviewer in \"The Times\" called it, \"A work of great beauty and charm\", although \"the influence of \"Die Meistersinger\" is felt to an extent that is almost absurd both in the bright overture and again in the procession of the guild, but elsewhere the music is as original as it is charming\".\n\nWith \"Madame Chrysanthème\" (1893), a four-act \"lyric comedy\" with no spoken dialogue, Messager reached a turning point in his development. The crux of the plot was the same as that later used by Puccini for \"Madama Butterfly\" (1904): a young Japanese geisha wooed and then abandoned by a foreign sailor. Messager's treatment of the story was praised for its sensitivity – reviewers in the Parisian press applauded him for raising opérette to the level of \"comédie lyrique\" – but he was a self-critical artist, and he felt he had strayed too far in the direction of opera and away from his chosen genre. Harding suggests that the unusual seriousness of the score may be connected with the recent illness and death of Edith Messager. Both Hughes and Harding comment that Messager's score is subtler than Puccini's, but add that the almost total eclipse of \"Madame Chrysanthème\" by \"Madama Butterfly\" may be partly due to the relative effectiveness of their libretti. After this, Messager consciously simplified his style, greatly reducing the harmonic subtleties that had been characteristic of his earlier works.\n\nThe works from the middle of the decade were unsuccessful financially and artistically. \"Le Chevalier d'Harmental\" (1896), classed by Hughes as Messager's first true opéra comique (\"in a somewhat pretentious style\") was a failure, and an unpretentious opérette in the same year, \"La Fiancée en loterie\", fared no better. After these disappointments Messager finished the 1890s with two considerable successes. Traubner describes \"Les P'tites Michu\" (1897) as \"a sensational hit\", and Harding calls it the best of Messager's opérettes so far (classing \"Le Basoche\" as opéra comique, as did its composer). The plot was not strikingly original: critics commented that its story of babies switched at birth was already very familiar from Gilbert and Sullivan operas. Traubner describes the piece as \"one of those unusual works that begin well enough and gets better and better\". Setting a scene in the market of Les Halles was not innovative, but Messager's chorus for the marchands and marchandes was out of the ordinary, and Traubner also singles out the duet for the Michus in Act 1: \"clever, lilting ... pulsating with an elegance and grace that other operetta composers have failed to obtain\". He also judges the finales as outstanding, including a waltz number that in other hands would be predictable but is turned by Messager into something much more symphonic.\n\nThe final work from the decade was \"Véronique\". Messager described it as an opéra comique, but commentators have classed it as a mixture of opérette and opéra comique. The score contains two of the composer's best known numbers, the \"Swing duet\" (\"Poussez, poussez l'escarpolette\") and the \"Donkey duet\" (\"De ci, de la\"). When the work was revived at the Proms in London in the 1960s, the music critic of \"The Times\" commented, \"Charming as it can prove in the theatre, the music alone is a little thin, with none of the piquancy that – thanks perhaps to Gilbert – redeems Messager's famous English contemporary Sullivan ... but \"Véronique\" has plenty of pretty things\". It became and has remained the composer's most performed musical theatre piece.\n\nMessager's work running opera houses in Paris and London limited his composing between \"Véronique\" and the period after the First World War. \"Fortunio\" (1907) was a rare example in his oeuvre of a sung-through opera. Eight decades later the critic Edward Greenfield described it as \"a long-buried jewel of a piece ... an improbable cross between musical comedy and \"Tristan und Isolde\"\". From 1919 onwards Messager composed no more opéras comiques. Among his post-war stage works, \"Monsieur Beaucaire\", a \"romantic operetta\" (1919), was his second work to an English libretto. French critics were inclined to look down on \"Messager's English operetta\" as over-sweet and sentimental to suit Anglo-Saxon tastes. Harding comments that the composer was successful in his attempt to produce an English flavour: one number is \"pure Edward German\" and there is much pastiche throughout the score. Despite the critics the piece ran well not only in Britain and the US, but also in France, with more than 300 performances in Paris and a long life in French provincial theatres.\n\nOf Messager's 1920s comédies musicales the best known is \"L'Amour masqué\" (1923). The Théâtre Édouard VII where it was premiered had a small orchestra pit, and Messager developed a new style of orchestration to deliver his desired musical effects with a small number of players. Harding comments that the piece was up-to-date enough to include a tango, \"a beautifully written example with luscious harmonies that by contrast show up the threadbare nature of most other efforts of the time\".\n\nMessager wrote songs for solo voice with piano throughout his career. Like Fauré, he was fond of the poetry of Armand Sylvestre, and from \"La Chanson des cerises\" in 1882 to the cycle \"Amour d'hiver\" in 1911 he set thirteen of Sylvestre's poems. Others whose verse he set ranged widely, from Victor Hugo to Frederic Weatherly (author of among other things \"Danny Boy\").\n\nIn his old age Messager said that he would have liked to write more concert works, but had never had the opportunity. The Symphony in A, written when he was 22, is on the normal classical plan with sonata form in the first and last movements, a songlike theme in the adagio and a scherzo third movement. Looking back he described it as \"très classique\". In notes to a 1992 recording of the piece, Xavier Deletang comments that although the influence of Mendelssohn and possibly Schumann may be discernible, the work reveals a mastery of instrumentation and a quintessentially French flavour, particularly in the wind parts. The two main subjects of the Allegro \"con moto\" first movement are strongly contrasted, with the opening string theme followed by a chorale-like theme for the winds.\n\nWhen Messager was elected to membership of the Académie des Beaux-Arts in 1926 the influential musical journal \"Le Ménestrel\" remarked that this conferred on his chosen genre – opérette – official status and recognition; but his fame as a composer of light music has tended to obscure his considerable standing in contemporary serious musical circles. It was said of him that he had \"seen all, heard all, and remembered all\". The leading composers of the time valued his friendship and advice. Fauré called him \"familiar with everything, knowing it all, fascinated by anything new\". Messager's younger colleague, the composer Reynaldo Hahn, wrote, \"I do believe that no musician has ever loved music as much as André Messager did. In any case, it would be impossible to have a greater musical curiosity than he did, up to the end of his life, too.\" Like Fauré, Messager wrote musical criticism for \"Le Figaro\" and other publications in the first decades of the 20th century. Unlike Fauré, who was known for his kindly reviews, Messager was frequently severe. His views carried weight: some of his criticisms were reported in the international press.\n\nIn 1908 Fauré wrote of Messager, \"There are not many examples in the history of music of an artist with such a complete education, of such profound knowledge, who consents to apply his gifts to forms regarded, nobody knows why, as secondary\". \"Baker's Biographical Dictionary of Musicians\" says of Messager, \"His style may be described as enlightened eclecticism; his music was characteristically French, and more specifically Parisian, in its elegance and gaiety.\" In his book \"Composers of Operetta\", Hughes comments that Messager combined \"a flow of spontaneous melody worthy of Offenbach with a flair for economic workmanship at least the equal of Lecocq's\" and in much of his music \"a measure of Massenet's fluent grace, Saint-Saëns's aristocratic elegance, even Fauré's refined subtlety\". He observes that Messager spanned an entire era: \"Auber, Rossini and Meyerbeer were still alive when he began his studies, yet he survived the First World War and witnessed the rise and decline of \"les Six\". ... For forty years he carried aloft the torch kindled by Adolphe Adam in 1834; after his death it soon flickered out\".\n\nThe wide range of Messager's musical sympathies was noted by \"Le Menéstral\", which said that he \"has served Wagner, Debussy, Fauré, Ravel and Stravinsky when their works were still struggling for recognition\". He was widely admired as a conductor. He avoided extravagant gesturing on the podium; Harding records, \"His manner was precise and undemonstrative. The baton flicked neatly here and there in a way that meant little to the audience behind him but conveyed volumes to the orchestra\". The music critic Pierre Lalo wrote that under Messager's direction, \"Parsifal\", without losing any of its grandeur, \"assumed a French clarity, and a sobriety, nobility and order ... even the most famous Bayreuth conductors have not always been able to do this.\" Not everyone shared Lalo's view; some audience members equated undemonstrativeness with dullness: Reynaldo Hahn commented, \"[Messager] is not a master of the theatre [\"chef du théâtre\"], being too exclusively musical; he sets too much store by detail without feeling the spirit of the public behind him, and does not understand the variable musical flow that makes one hold one's breath, sigh and wait.\" Nevertheless, Hahn admired Messager as an orchestral conductor:\n\nIn 1918 Messager conducted recordings in New York, with the Orchestre de la Société des Concerts du Conservatoire, of \"Les Chasseresses\" and \"Cortège de Bacchus\" from \"Sylvia\" by Delibes, Sérénade and Mules from \"Impressions d'Italie\" by Charpentier, the Bacchanale from \"Samson et Dalila\" and the Prelude to \"Le Déluge\", both by Saint-Saëns, and 4½-minute extracts from \"Capriccio espagnol\" by Rimsky-Korsakov and \"Le Rouet d'Omphale\" by Saint-Saëns. In Wagstaff's 1991 study of Messager, the list of recordings of the composer's music runs to 40 pages; 24 of his works are represented in the list of recordings up to that date.\nComplete recordings exist of several of Messager's stage works. There are three complete sets of \"Véronique\" – a 1953 mono recording for the Société française du son conducted by Pierre Dervaux, a 1969 stereo EMI recording conducted by Jean-Claude Hartemann, and a 1998 recording sung in English, conducted by J. Lynn Thompson. Other complete sets include \"L'Amour masqué\" (1970; conductor, Raymond Legrand), \"La Basoche\" (1960; Tony Aubin), \"Coups de roulis\" (1963; Marcel Cariven), \"Fortunio\" (1987; John Eliot Gardiner), \"Isoline\" (1947; Louis Beydts), \"Monsieur Beaucaire\" (1958; Jules Gressier), and \"Passionnément\" (1964; Jean-Paul Kreder).\n\nSingers who have recorded individual numbers by Messager include role creators such as Jean Périer (\"Véronique\"), Lucien Fugère (\"La Basoche\"), Pierre Darmant and Yvonne Printemps (\"L'Amour masqué\"), Koval (\"Passionnément\"), Marcelle Denya (\"Coups de roulis\"), and Maggie Teyte (\"Monsieur Beaucaire\"), as well as other contemporaries – Aino Ackté, Emma Eames, and John McCormack – whose recordings have been reissued on compact disc. Singers of the next generation who recorded Messager numbers included Georges Thill and Ninon Vallin. More recent examples include Mady Mesplé, Susan Graham, and Felicity Lott. \n\nOf Messager's non-operatic works, his \"Messe des pêcheurs de Villerville\", written jointly with Fauré, has been recorded by, among others, Harmonia Mundi, conducted by Philippe Herreweghe (1989). Messager's other collaboration with Fauré, the Wagner send-up \"Souvenirs de Bayreuth\", has been recorded by piano duettists including Kathryn Stott and Martin Roscoe (1995, Hyperion), and, in an orchestral arrangement, by the orchestra of the Bayreuth Festival. A suite from \"Les Deux Pigeons\" has been recorded several times, for example by the Orchestra of the Royal Opera House, Covent Garden, conducted by Hugo Rignold (1948) and by Charles Mackerras (1958); in 1993 Decca recorded the complete score with the Orchestra of Welsh National Opera conducted by Richard Bonynge. The Symphony in A has been recorded by the Orchestre Symphonique du Mans, conducted by Jose-Andre Gendille (2001).\n\nSingle act, except where shown\n\n\n\nFor solo voice with orchestral accompaniment\nFor solo voice with piano accompaniment\nSource: \"Grove Dictionary of Music and Musicians\"; L'académie nationale de l'opérette; and Wagstaff: \"André Messager\".\n\n\n"}

He published extensively, and attempted to \"improve\" Gothic forms by giving them classical proportions.\n\nLangley was baptised in Twickenham, Middlesex, the son of a jobbing gardener Daniel Langley and his wife Elizabeth. He bore the name of David Batty, one of his fathers' patrons. He started worked as a gardener, inheriting some of his father's clients in Twickenham, then a village of suburban villas within easy reach of London by a pleasant water journey on the Thames. An early client was Thomas Vernon of Twickenham Park.\n\nHe married Anne Smith in February 1719. They had four children, but she died in June 1726. He had ten further children with his second wife, Catherine.\nLangley moved into surveying and landscape gardening. He published his first book, \"Practical Geometry\", in 1726. Inspired by Switzer's \"Ichnographia Rustica\" of 1718, Langley advocated more irregular, informal gardens, with rococo \"arti-natural\" landscaping. His sinuous forms predated Hogath's line of beauty.\n\nFor the Palladian house built at Twickenham by James Johnston in 1710 (later \"Orleans House\", demolished 1926), Langley, probably on his own endeavour, prepared and published a garden plan, which offered an encyclopaedia of the garden features that were swiftly becoming obsolete by the time the plan (\"illustration, right\") was published in Langley's \"A Sure Method of Improving Estates\" (1728): here are several mazes, a \"wilderness\" with many tortuous path-turnings, \"cabinets de verdure\" cut into dense woodland, formal stretches of canal and formally shaped basins of water, some with central fountains, a central allée of trees leading to an exedra.\n\nHis \"New Principles of Gardening\" (1728) included designs for mazes, a feature he could never quite leave behind, with 28 plates engraved by his brother Thomas. He also published \"A Sure Method of Improving Estates\" (1728) and \"Pomona\" (1729).\n\nHe also undertook work at Castle Howard and Wrest Park.\n\nLangley moved from Twickenham to London in 1729, and shifted again from landscape gardening to architecture. Working near Exeter Change in the Strand, he published \"A Sure Guide to Builders\" in 1729. He moved to Westminster in the 1730s, where he started to teach drawing, geometry, architecture, and garden design, and continued to teach when he moved to Soho in 1738. He also made and sold stone garden ornaments.\n\nDespite his literary aspirations, and advertisements in architectural journals, he secured few commissions, submitting an unsolicited proposal for the competition to design a new Mansion House in 1735 and a design for a new Westminster Bridge in 1736-7. He inclined strongly towards a home-grown English architectural form, publishing articles in the Grub Street Journal under the pseudonym \"Hiram\" from July 1734 to March 1735, praising Gothic architecture (or as he termed it \"native Saxon\") and rejecting the \"imported\" Palladian architecture favoured by Lord Burlington and his circle.\n\nHe published a wide range of architectural books, from a huge folio on \"Ancient Masonry\" in parts from 1733 to 1736 with over 450 plates, through \"The Builder's Complete Assistant\" of 1738 (also known as \"The Builder's Complete Chest-Book\") and \"The Builder's Jewel\" of 1741, to the tiny \"The Workman's Golden Rule\" in 1750, in vicesimo-quarto.\n\nHe is best known for one of his confident self-promotions, \"Ancient Architecture, Restored, and Improved\" published in 1742 and reissued in 1747 as \"Gothic Architecture, improved by Rules and Proportions\", a bit of cockscombry that thoroughly irritated Horace Walpole, whose Gothick villa at Twickenham, Strawberry Hill, gave impetus to the stirrings of the Gothic Revival:\n\nAll that his books achieved, has been to teach carpenters to massacre that venerable species, and to give occasion to those who know nothing of the matter, and who mistake his clumsy efforts for real imitations, to censure the productions of our ancestors, whose bold and beautiful fabrics Sir Christopher Wren viewed and reviewed with astonishment, and never mentioned without esteem. (Walpole, \"Anecdotes of Painting\", 1798, p 484)\n\nHis book, with engravings by his brother Thomas Langley, attempted to improve Gothic forms by giving them classical proportions and to create a scheme of architectural orders for Gothic architecture. He provided inspiration for elements of buildings from Great Fulford and Hartland Abbey in Devon, to Speedwell Castle in Brewood in Staffordshire, and Tissington Hall in Derbyshire, and the Gothic temple at Bramham Park in Yorkshire, and gates at Castletown House in County Kildare.\n\nLangley's books were also enormously influential in Britain's American colonies. At Mount Vernon, for example, George Washington relied upon plate 51 of Langley's \"The City and Country Builder's and Workman's Treasury of Designs\" as the source for the famous Venetian (or Palladian) window in the dining room; upon plate 54 of the same book for the ocular window on Mount Vernon's western facade; and upon plate 75 of Langley's \"The Builder's Jewel\" for the rusticated wood siding.\n\nBatty Langley was also thought to be an important Freemason; his naming of his son Hiram was a reference to the architect, prominent in Masonic tradition and symbolism, of Solomon's Temple, and many of his books were dedicated to his Masonic brethren. The \"frontispiece\" to \"The Builder's Jewel\" (1741), for example, contains many examples of Masonic symbolism found in the first three degrees of Freemasonry.\n\nHe was imprisoned for debt in Newgate Prison and wrote an account of that institution, \"An Accurate Description of Newgate\". He died at home in Soho.\n\n"}

Furthermore, the American Psychological Association has also honoured her by accepting her as fellow in 2000.\n\nCurrently, Professor Kitzinger is using conversation analysis to explore the ordinary mundane reproduction of heterosexism in everyday talk-in-interaction, and aside from her work at the University of York she also serves as associate editor of \"Feminism & Psychology\".\n\nWilkinson is Professor of Feminist and Health Studies in the Department of Social Sciences at Loughborough University in Leicestershire.\n\nWilkinson completed her undergraduate studies at the University of Leicester, graduating with a BSc degree in psychology. From there, she proceeded to earn a PhD specialising in gender issues, particularly regarding the role of women in psychology.\n\nWilkinson's first academic post was as a lecturer at the University of Liverpool; following this she took position as Head of the Psychology department at Coventry University. After Coventry, Wilkinson accepted a research post at the University of Hull, then left this post to accept a Visiting Professorship at the University of Waikato. After this position in 1999, Wilkinson was granted a full professorship at Loughborough, having been associated with the university since 1994. Despite this, Professor Wilkinson decided to accept a sabbatical between 2001 and 2002; she spent this year firstly working at the University of California, Santa Barbara, and then serving as a visiting scholar at the University of California, Los Angeles. The following year she took special leave to take chair as the Ruth Wynn Woodward Endowed Professor of Women's Studies at Simon Fraser University, Canada. It was whilst in Canada that Professor Kitzinger and Professor Wilkinson decided to marry.\n\nWilkinson has received great recognition as an accomplished academic, and has a strong involvement with the British Psychological Society, being instrumental in the foundation of its \"Psychology of Women\" section, for which she served as the first head, and also its \"Lesbian and Gay Psychology\" section.\n\nWilkinson is currently researching the expression of emotions in talk-in-interaction, as part of her role at Loughborough. Wilkinson has co-authored four books with Kitzinger, and serves as the editor of the academic journal \"Feminism & Psychology\".\n\nThe couple married in Yaletown, Vancouver, in August 2003, a few weeks after same-sex marriage became legal in British Columbia, where Wilkinson had been working as a Visiting Professor at Simon Fraser University. On their return to the UK, the couple discovered that their relationship had no legal status at all. Two years later, with the implementation of the Civil Partnership Act, the relationship was automatically converted to a civil partnership.\n\nThe couple sued for the recognition of their marriage, the trial beginning on 5 June 2006 before Sir Mark Potter, President of the Family Division. For an overseas marriage to be recognised in the UK, it must be shown that the marriage was legal, recognised in the country in which it was executed, and that nothing in the country's law restricted freedom to marry; Kitzinger and Wilkinson argued that their marriage fulfilled these requirements even though people cannot legally enter into same-sex marriages in the UK. They rejected entering a civil partnership, believing them to be both symbolically and practically a lesser substitute, and asked the court to recognise their overseas marriage in the same way that it would recognise the marriage of an opposite-sex couple. They argued that a failure to do so breached their human rights under Articles 8 (right to respect for privacy and family life), 12 (right to marry) and 14 (prohibition of discrimination), taken together with Article 8 and/or 12 of the European Convention on Human Rights, which was incorporated into domestic UK law by the Human Rights Act 1998.\n\nIn a 21 September 2005 press release issued by Liberty, the British civil rights organisation which supported their case, Kitzinger and Wilkinson said: This is fundamentally about equality. We want our marriage to be recognised as a marriage - just like any other marriage made in Canada. It is insulting and discriminatory to be offered a civil partnership instead. Civil partnerships are an important step forward for same-sex couples, but they are not enough. We want full equality in marriage.James Welch, Legal Director at Liberty, said: Our clients entered into a legal marriage in Canada. It is a matter of fairness and equality that they should be treated the same way as any other couple who marries abroad: their marriage should be recognised here. They shouldn't have to settle for the second-best option of a civil partnership.The High Court announced its judgement on 31 July 2006, finding that the marriage would continue to be recognised as a civil partnership in England and Wales, but not as a marriage. In handing down his ruling, the President of the Family Division, Sir Mark Potter, gave as his reason that \"Abiding single sex relationships are in no way inferior, nor does English Law suggest that they are by according them recognition under the name of civil partnership\" and that marriage was an \"age-old institution\" which, he suggested, was by \"longstanding definition and acceptance\" a relationship between a man and a woman. He described this as an \"insurmountable hurdle\" to the couple's case. While agreeing that they were discriminated against by the Civil Partnership Act 2004, he considered that \"To the extent that by reason of that distinction it discriminates against same-sex partners, such discrimination has a legitimate aim, is reasonable and proportionate, and falls within the margin of appreciation accorded to Convention States.\" The Attorney General, as Second Respondent, sought £25,000 in costs.\n\nThe couple announced their intention to appeal against the decision of the High Court, but later abandoned this due to lack of funds.\n\nOn 13 March 2014, their overseas marriage was recognised by the Government as a legal marriage as the Marriage (Same Sex Couples) Act 2013 came into force.\n\n\n\n"}

The first recorded grammatical treatise in the Ga and Fante languages were written by Protten and published in Copenhagen in 1764.\n\nChristian Jacob Protten was born on 15 September 1715 in Christiansborg, Gold Coast, now known as the suburb of Osu, Accra in Ghana. His Danish father, Jacob Protten, alias \"Prot\", \"Prodt\", \"Prott,\" was a soldier stationed with the garrison at the Christiansborg Castle in Osu. His Ga mother of Togolese ancestry, was a princess and the daughter of a chief or king, Nii Ofori Ashangmo, the ruler of the Ga state from 1660 to 1680. Historical records list his mother’s name simply by her initials, “N. N.”.

Archival records indicate that Christian Protten’s maternal uncle, Ashangmo, also Foli Bebe or Ofori Bembeneen was a coastal chieftain in the former Portuguese slave market of Little Popo (Aného) in modern-day Togo, and ruled the Guin/Ge State there from 1694 to 1727 or 1731/33. After the passing of Ashangmo, his son, Assiongbon Dandjin became the new ruler at Aneho sometime between 1731/33 and 1737. Christian Protten appears to have been a candidate for succession but only matrilineally.\n\nChristian Protten’s early education was at the Danish language-Christiansborg Castle School for mulattoes, where he was tutored by a Lutheran minister. With the confines of the fort, Protten was introduced to Christianity and mastered the Danish language. In 1726, at the age of 11, he was chosen and sent to Copenhagen, Denmark, together with another Euro-African pupil, Friederich Pedersen. Protten recalled that the decision to send him to a school in Denmark was against his will. His mother's family was also against this development. On the day of his departure, as he was rowed out to the waiting ship, his relatives stood on the beach, hoping the canoe would capsize and Protten would return to safety on the shore. At the age of 12, King Frederick IV of Denmark (reigned 1699–1730) took interest in his welfare and became his godfather at his baptism on 27 November, 1727. After his baptism, he assumed the name Christian Jacob Protten. Protten then enrolled in a trade apprenticeship to become a blacksmith. Initially, he was disheartened to partake in the vocational training as he desired a more academic education. In 1732, he finally matriculated at the University of Copenhagen where he studied theology, completing his studies in 1735 at the age of twenty. \n\nIn 1735, Christian Protten met Nikolaus Ludwig, Reichsgraf von Zinzendorf und Pottendorf (1700–60), the Bishop of the Moravian Church, at the Danish court. Shortly thereafter, he became acquainted with the Moravian fellowship and moved to Herrnhut, the Moravian colony at Berthelsdolf, which later became Saxony, staying there for the next twelve months and learning German along the way. Protten was deeply unhappy in Germany, noting in his diary that that Europeans described him as “\"afrikanisch wild\"” (African savage) and “\"mohrisch\"” (Moorish). In 1737, Christian Protten, along with Moravia native, Henry Huckoff, sailed from Amsterdam, the Netherlands to the Gold Coast to begin a new life as Moravian missionaries.. Commenting on Protten’s perceived conceitedness, Zinzendorf wrote, \"“Protten has a high opinion of himself. Presumptiveness and a high opinion of oneself only prostitute a person and carry no weight with the Saviour\".” He was alleged to have been prone to fits of uncontrollable anger. Prior his departure to the Gold Coast, Count Zinzendorf instructed, \"“Dear Christian: In order to convert the Moors, you must leave all your Moorish bad habits in Amsterdam.”\" Despite these negative remarks before his departure, Protten was nonetheless tasked with establishing a school for Euro-African children in Elmina. The ship docked at Elmina on 11 May 1737. Henry Huckuff passed away, presumably from fever, a month after their arrival. This new situation resulted in a change in plans for Protten who ended up visiting his mother in Little Popo/Aného, Togo. According to the Gold Coast historian and Basel Mission pastor, Carl Christian Reindorf, Protten visited his relatives at Aného in September 1737. He was reportedly kept there against his will and only returned to Osu in 1739. \n\nHis plans to start a school at Elmina were thwarted by the Dutch Governor at the time, Martinus François de Bordes who viewed Protten as a Danish spy and detained him for three years until 1740. de Bordes died in office on 16 March 1740. The political situation at the time was unfavourable as the Dutch had waged a war against the Dahomey. During Protten’s imprisonment in Elmina, he was infected with malaria. Upon his release, he served as an educator for a year. In 1741, upon the receipt of a letter of invitation from von Zinzendorf, Christian Protten returned to Herrnhut, after failing to win converts on the Gold Coast.. In 1743, he sailed to the island of Saint Thomas in the West Indies as an independent missionary.. While in the Caribbean, he remained detached from other missionaries there. He returned to Germany in 1745 with the aim of going back to the Gold Coast. However, the Moravian leaders were not in favour of that proposal, although homesick Protten was desperate to return to his homeland. He therefore remained in the Moravian communities for the next decade. \n\nThere were constant tensions between Zinzendorf and Protten due to the latter’s alcoholism and alleged haughtiness. In 1756, Protten and his wife, Rebecca were banished from the Moravian commune in Herrnhut to the village of Großhennersdorf in the Görlitz district. He received permission to return to West Africa, leaving his wife, who rejoined the religious community at Herrnhut.\n\nIn 1757, he received his commission from the Royal Chartered Danish West India and Guinea Company to become a teacher and a preacher at his alma mater, the Christiansborg Castle School. As the vessel approached the West African coast, it landed on the Grain Coast (now Liberia) where he stayed for almost four months. He arrived in Christiansborg in June 1757 and reconnected with his family. He returned to Europe in July 1761, arriving in Herrnhut in 1762; he reunited with his wife and the other Moravians. This particular journey occurred after the death of a Euro-African pupil, who Protten had accidentally shot while cleaning his rifle at the castle. Christian Protten was briefly imprisoned for this incident. In 1765, he returned to the Gold Coast with his wife, Rebecca. With the blessing of the Moravian church, he became the schoolmaster of the castle school until his death in 1769. Earlier in 1764, he had submitted a proposal to the Danish Crown, King Frederick V of Denmark (reigned 1746-66), to establish a boarding school at Christiansborg which would include a curriculum in indigenous languages, highlighting the importance he attached to literacy in his mother tongue. \n\nHistorians have concluded that his education and mission initiatives on the Gold Coast were essentially failed projects. His last years in Christiansborg seem to have been troubled. In the final decades of the 18th century, several other Moravian missionaries who were sent from Europe did not survive beyond the first few months due to tropical afflictions, particularly malaria and yellow fever.\n\nIn 1764, Christian Jacob Protten wrote his magnum opus, \"\"En nyttig Grammaticalsk Indledelse til Tvende hidintil gandske ubekiendte Sprog, Fanteisk og Acraisk\",\" an introductory treatise to the grammar of the Ga and Fante languages which was published in Copenhagen. Seen as his greatest achievement, the text acted as trilingual (Danish, Fante, Ga) catechesis manual for European missionaries who yearned to learn the two Ghanaian native languages. Furthermore, Protten translated Martin Luther’s \"Smaller Catechism\" into the Fante and Ga languages.. \n\n\nOn 6 June 1746, he married Rebecca Freundlich (1718–1780) in Herrnhut, Germany. Freundlich was also known as “Shelly”, a mulatress and a former slave from the Caribbean who was the widow of a Moravian missionary, Matthäus Freundlich (c. 1681-c. 1742). Rebecca Freundlich was born on the island of Antigua in Antigua and Barbuda. Rebecca Freundlich had an arranged marriage to Matthaus Freundlich. They were married on 4 May 1738. The Freundlichs were persecuted and imprisoned for their Christian faith while they were sharing the Gospel to slaves in Saint Thomas. Rebecca Freundlich had a daughter, Anna Maria Freundlich, from her first marriage, who was born circa 1740, on the island of Saint Thomas, now the US Virgin Islands. Anna Freundlich died in 1744, aged 4 years, in Germany. The Freundlich family had travelled to Germany due to Matthaus Freundlich’s ill-health. He however died during the voyage across Germany. In 1750, Christian and Rebecca Protten had a daughter, Anna Maria Protten who died in infancy in Herrnhut, Dresden in Sachsen, Germany.\n\nChristian Jacob Protten died in 1769 in Christiansborg, Accra, leaving his wife, Rebecca, widowed for a second time. She had not fully acclimatised to the Gold Coast and the Moravian missionaries contemplated sending her back to Saint Thomas. As she was in poor health, it was decided she remained on the Gold Coast, where she eventually died in 1780, aged 62 years. The appendix to Protten’s booklet was the first published grammar of an indigenous language of the Gold Coast. His linguistic work in the Ga language predated that of the German philologist and Basel missionary, Johannes Zimmermann (1825–1876) by a century. Zimmerman also translated the entire Bible into the Ga language. In effect, his grammatical output was an example for both Zimmermann and the Basel Mission pastor and historian, Carl Christian Reindorf (1834–1917), whose literary masterpiece, The History of the Gold Coast and Asante was written in the Ga and English languages and published in 1895 in Basel. Moreover, as a mulatto or an Atlantic Creole, Protten was able to hone his linguistic talents and abilities by blending his African upbringing and his European education, through a spatial awareness of the missionary settings he lived in the 1700s.\n\n"}
{"id": "33744337", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=33744337", "title": "Controversies surrounding Silvio Berlusconi", "text": "Controversies surrounding Silvio Berlusconi\n\nSilvio Berlusconi is an Italian media mogul and former Prime Minister of Italy who owns the largest broadcasting company in that country, Mediaset. His promises to buy off his personal assets to avoid conflicts of interest were never fulfilled, which sparked controversy throughout his terms in office. Berlusconi is a controversial figure in modern Italian politics: his tenure as Prime Minister was racked with scandalous sex affairs and poor judgement and decision-making. These events were widely covered by the media, drawing outcry from many of his Italian contemporaries and worldwide counterparts.\n\nAccording to journalists Marco Travaglio and Enzo Biagi, Berlusconi entered politics to save his companies from bankruptcy and himself from convictions. From the very beginning he said it clearly to his associates. Berlusconi's supporters hailed him as the \"novus homo\", an outsider who was going to bring a new efficiency to the public bureaucracy and reform the state from top to bottom.\n\nWhile investigating these matters, three journalists noted the following facts:\n\nControversy concerning Berlusconi's 'conflicts of interest' are usually centered around the use of his media and marketing power for political gain. However, there is also controversy regarding his financial gains. When RAI was being run by a two-man team appointed by the presidents of the Chamber of Deputies and the Senate (both in Berlusconi's coalition), the state broadcaster increased its viewers, but lost a significant share of its advertising revenue to the rival Mediaset group, owned and run by the Berlusconi family, which has led to large personal gain. \n\nBerlusconi's governments has passed some laws that have shortened statutory terms for tax fraud. Romano Prodi, who defeated Berlusconi in 2006, claimed that these were \"ad personam laws,\" meant to solve Berlusconi's problems and defend his interests.\n\nBerlusconi's extensive control over the media has been widely criticised by some analysts, some press freedom organisations, and extensively on several Italian newspapers, national and private TV channels by opposition leaders and in general opposition parties members, who allege Italy's media has limited freedom of expression. However such coverage of the complaint in practice put under discussion the point of the complaint itself. The \"Freedom of the Press 2004 Global Survey\", an annual study issued by the American organisation Freedom House, downgraded Italy's ranking from 'Free' to 'Partly Free' due to Berlusconi's influence over RAI, a ranking which, in \"Western Europe\" was shared only with Turkey (). Reporters Without Borders states that in 2004, \"The conflict of interests involving prime minister Silvio Berlusconi and his vast media empire was still not resolved and continued to threaten news diversity\". In April 2004, the International Federation of Journalists joined the criticism, objecting to the passage of a law vetoed by Carlo Azeglio Ciampi in 2003, which critics believe is designed to protect Berlusconi's reported 90% control of the Italian national media.\n\nBerlusconi owns via Mediaset 3 of 7 national TV channels: (Canale 5, Italia 1, and Rete 4). To better understand the controversies over a conflict of interest between Berlusconi's personal business empire and his political office, it is necessary to look at the structure of governmental control over State television. Under the law, the Speakers of the two Houses appoint the RAI president and board of directors. In practice, the decision is a political one, generally resulting in some opposition representatives becoming directors, while top managerial posts go to people sympathetic to the government. It was normal to have two directors and the president belonging to the parliamentary majority, and two directors who are opposition supporters. A parliamentary supervisory commission also exists, whose president is traditionally a member of the opposition. During the tenure of Mr. Baldassarre as RAI president, the two opposition directors and the one closer to the Union of Christian and Centre Democrats left over internal disagreements that mainly regarded censorship issues. RAI continued to be run by a two-man team (mockingly nicknamed by the opposition \"the Japanese\" after the Japanese soldiers who kept fighting on in the Pacific Ocean after the end of World War II).\n\nThe former Italian center-left coalition of Romano Prodi was often criticised for failing to pass a law to regulate the potential \"conflict of interest\" that might arise between media ownership and the holding of political office, despite having governed Italy for an entire legislature from 1996 to 2001. In 2002, Luciano Violante, a prominent member of the Left, said in a speech in Parliament: \"Honourable Anedda, I invite you to ask the honourable Berlusconi, because he certainly knows that he received a full guarantee in 1994, when the government changed—that TV stations would not be touched. He knows it and the Honourable Letta knows it.\"\n\nThe authors of the book \"Inciucio\" cite this sentence as evidence for the idea that the Left made a deal with Berlusconi in 1994, in which a promise was made not to honour a law in the Constitutional Court of Italy that would have required Berlusconi to give up one of his three TV channels in order to uphold pluralism and competition. According to the authors, this would be an explanation of why the Left, despite having won the 1996 elections, did not pass a law to solve the conflicts of interest between media ownership and politics.\n\nBerlusconi's influence over RAI became evident when in Sofia, Bulgaria he expressed his views on journalists Enzo Biagi and Michele Santoro, and comedian Daniele Luttazzi. Berlusconi said that they \"use television as a criminal means of communication\". They lost their jobs as a result. This statement was called by critics \"Editto Bulgaro\".\n\nThe TV broadcasting of a satirical programme called \"RAIot\" was censored in November 2003 after the comedian Sabina Guzzanti made outspoken criticism of the Berlusconi media empire. Mediaset, one of Berlusconi's companies, sued RAI over Guzzanti's program, demanding 20 million euros for \"damages\"; in November 2003 the show was cancelled by the president of RAI, Lucia Annunziata. The details of the event were made into a Michael Moore-style documentary called \"Viva Zapatero!\", which was produced by Guzzanti.\n\nMediaset, Berlusconi's television group, has stated that it uses the same criteria as the public (state-owned) television RAI in assigning a proper visibility to all the most important political parties and movements (the so-called 'Par Condicio') – which has been since often disproved. In March 2006, on the television channel Rai Tre, in a television interview with Lucia Annunziata during his talk show, \"In 1/2 h\", he stormed out of the studio because of a disagreement with the host journalist regarding the economic consequences of his government. In November 2007, allegations of news manipulation caused the departure from RAI of Berlusconi's personal assistant.\n\nEnrico Mentana, the news anchor long seen as a guarantor of Canale 5’s independence, walked out in April 2008, saying that he no longer felt “at home in a group that seems like an electoral (campaign) committee”\n\nOn 24 June 2009, Silvio Berlusconi during the Confindustria young members congress in Santa Margherita Ligure, Italy has invited the advertisers to interrupt or boycott the advertising contracts with the magazines and newspapers published by Gruppo Editoriale L'Espresso, in particular the \"la Repubblica\" and the newsmagazine \"L'espresso\", calling the publishing group \"shameless\", because is fueling the economic crisis speaking more and more about it and accusing also to make a subversive attack against him to replace with an \"un-elected\". The publishing group has announced to begin legal proceedings against Berlusconi, to protect the image and the interests of the group.\n\nOn 12 October 2009, Silvio Berlusconi during the Confindustria Monza and Brianza members congress, has again invited the industrialists present to a \"widespread rebellion\" against a \"newspaper that hadn't any limits in discrediting the government and the country and indoctrinating foreign newspapers\".\n\nIn October 2009, Reporters Without Borders secretary-general declared that Berlusconi \"is on the verge of being added to our list of Predators of Press Freedom\", which would be a first for a European leader. He also added that Italy will probably be ranked last in the European Union in the upcoming edition of the RWB press freedom index.\n\nOne of Berlusconi's strongest critics in the media outside Italy is the British weekly \"The Economist\" (nicknamed by Berlusconi \"The Ecommunist\"), which in its issue of 26 April 2001 carried a title on its front cover, 'Why Silvio Berlusconi is unfit to lead Italy'. The war of words between Berlusconi and \"The Economist\" has gained notoriety, with Berlusconi taking the publication to court in Rome and \"The Economist\" publishing letters against him. The magazine claimed that the documentation contained in its article proves that Berlusconi is 'unfit' for office because of his numerous conflicts of interest. Berlusconi claimed the article contained \"a series of old accusations\" that was an \"insult to truth and intelligence\".\n\nAccording to \"The Economist\"'s findings, Berlusconi, while Prime Minister of Italy, retained effective control of 90% of all national television broadcasting. This figure included stations he owns directly as well as those over which he had indirect control by dint of his position as Prime Minister and his ability to influence the choice of the management bodies of these stations. \"The Economist\" has also claimed that the Italian Prime Minister is corrupt and self-serving. A key journalist for \"The Economist\", David Lane, has set out many of these charges in his book \"Berlusconi's Shadow\".\n\nLane points out that Berlusconi has not defended himself in court against the main charges, but has relied upon political and legal manipulations, most notably by changing the statute of limitation to prevent charges being completed in the first place. In order to publicly prove the truth of the documented accusations contained in their articles, the newspaper has publicly challenged Berlusconi to sue \"The Economist\" for libel. Berlusconi did so, losing versus \"The Economist\", and being charged for all the trial costs on 5 September 2008, when the Court in Milan issued a judgment rejecting all Mr Berlusconi's claims and sentenced him to compensate for legal expenses.\n\nIn June 2011, \"The Economist\" published a strong article dealing with Mr. Berlusconi, titled \"The Man who screwed an entire country\".\n\nBerlusconi's career as an entrepreneur is also often questioned by his detractors. The allegations made against him generally include suspicions about the extremely fast increase of his activity as a construction entrepreneur in years 1961–63, hinting at the possibility that in those years he received money from unknown and possibly illegal sources. These accusations are regarded by Berlusconi and his supporters as empty slander, trying to undermine Berlusconi's reputation as a self-made man. Also frequently cited by opponents are events dating to the 1980s, including supposed \"favour exchanges\" between Berlusconi and Bettino Craxi, the former Socialist prime minister and leader of the Italian Socialist Party convicted in 1994 for various corruption charges. The Milan magistrates who indicted and successfully convicted Mr. Craxi in their \"Clean Hands\" investigation laid bare an entrenched system in which businessmen paid hundreds of millions of dollars to political parties or individual politicians in exchange for sweetheart deals with Italian state companies and the government itself. Berlusconi acknowledges a personal friendship with Craxi.\n\nOn some occasions, which raised a strong upheaval in the Italian political opposition, laws passed by the Berlusconi administration have effectively delayed ongoing trials on him. Relevant examples are the law reducing punishment for all cases of false accounting and the law on \"legitimate suspicion\", which allowed defendants to request their cases to be moved to another court if they believe that the local judges are biased against them. Because of these legislative actions, political opponents accuse Berlusconi of passing these laws for the purpose of protecting himself from legal charges. An enquiry realised by the newspaper \"La Repubblica\" sustained that Berlusconi passed 17 different laws which have advantaged himself; Berlusconi and his allies, on the other hand, maintain that such laws are consistent with everyone's right to a rapid and just trial, and with the principle of \"presumption of innocence\" (guarantism); furthermore, they claim that Berlusconi is being subjected to a political \"witch hunt\", orchestrated by certain (allegedly left-wing) judges.\n\nFor such reasons, Berlusconi and his government have an ongoing quarrel with the Italian judiciary, which reached its peak in 2003 when Berlusconi commented to a foreign journalist that judges are \"mentally disturbed\" and \"anthropologically different from the rest of the human race\", remarks that he later claimed he meant to be directed to specific judges only, and of a humorous nature. More seriously, the Berlusconi administration has long been planning a judiciary reform intended to limit the flexibility currently enjoyed by judges and magistrates in their decision-making, but which, according to its critics, will instead limit the magistrature's independence, by \"de facto\" subjecting the judiciary to the executive's control. This reform has met almost unanimous dissent from the Italian judges and, after three years of debate and struggle, was passed by the Italian parliament in December 2004, but was immediately vetoed by the Italian President, Carlo Azeglio Ciampi , because of the unconstitutionality of some of the passed laws.\n\nBerlusconi has also been indicted in Spain for charges of tax fraud and violation of anti-trust laws regarding the private television network Telecinco, but his status as a member of the European Parliament allowed him to gain immunity from prosecution until 2005.\nAll the accused have been acquitted by the Spanish Supreme Court in July 2008.\n\nDuring the night hours between 5 and 6 March 2010, the Berlusconi-led Italian government passed a decree \"interpreting\" the electoral law so as to let the PDL candidate run for governor in Lazio after she had failed to properly register for the elections. The Italian Constitution states that electoral procedures can only be changed in Parliament, and must not be changed by governmental decree. Italy's President, whose endorsement of the decree was required by law, said amid much controversy that the measure taken by the government may not violate the Constitution.\n\nSilvio Berlusconi has never been tried on charges relating to \"Cosa Nostra\", although several Mafia turncoats have stated that Berlusconi had connections with the Sicilian criminal association. The claims arise mostly from the hiring of Vittorio Mangano, charged for Mafia association, as a gardener and stable-man at Berlusconi's Villa San Martino in Arcore, a small town near Milan. It was Berlusconi's friend Marcello Dell'Utri who introduced Mangano to Berlusconi in 1973. Berlusconi denied any ties to the Mafia. Marcello Dell'Utri even stated that the Mafia did not exist at all.\n\nIn 2004 Dell'Utri, co-founder of Forza Italia, was sentenced to nine years by a Palermo court on charge of \"external association to the Mafia\", a sentence describing Dell'Utri as a mediator between the economical interests of Berlusconi and members of the criminal organisation. Berlusconi refused to comment on the sentence. In 2010, Palermo's appeals court cut the sentence to seven years but fully confirmed Dell'Utri's role as a link between Berlusconi and the mafia until 1992.\n\nIn 1996, a Mafia informer, Salvatore Cancemi, declared that Berlusconi and Dell'Utri were in direct contact with Salvatore Riina, head of the Sicilian Mafia in the 1980s and 90s. Cancemi disclosed that Fininvest, through Marcello Dell'Utri and mafioso Vittorio Mangano, had paid Cosa Nostra 200 million lire (between 100 000 and 200 000 of today's euro) annually. The alleged contacts, according to Cancemi, were to lead to legislation favourable to Cosa Nostra, in particular the harsh 41-bis prison regime. The underlying premise was that Cosa Nostra would support Berlusconi's Forza Italia party in return for political favours. After a two-year investigation, magistrates closed the inquiry without charges. They did not find evidence to corroborate Cancemi’s allegations. Similarly, a two-year investigation, also launched on evidence from Cancemi, into Berlusconi’s alleged association with the Mafia was closed in 1996.\n\nAccording to yet another Mafia turncoat, Antonino Giuffrè – arrested on 16 April 2002 – the Mafia turned to Berlusconi's Forza Italia party to look after the Mafia's interests, after the decline in the early 1990s of the ruling Christian Democrat party, whose leaders in Sicily looked after the Mafia's interests in Rome. The Mafia's fall out with the Christian Democrats became clear when Salvo Lima was killed in March 1992. \"The Lima murder marked the end of an era,\" Giuffrè told the court. \"A new era opened with a new political force on the horizon which provided the guarantees that the Christian Democrats were no longer able to deliver. To be clear, that party was Forza Italia.\" Dell'Utri was the go-between on a range of legislative efforts to ease pressure on mafiosi in exchange for electoral support, according to Giuffrè. \"Dell'Utri was very close to Cosa Nostra and a very good contact point for Berlusconi,\" he said. Mafia boss Bernardo Provenzano told Giuffrè that they \"were in good hands\" with Dell'Utri, who was a \"serious and trustworthy person\". Provenzano stated that the Mafia's judicial problems would be resolved within 10 years after 1992, thanks to the undertakings given by Forza Italia.\n\nGiuffrè also said that Berlusconi himself used to be in touch with Stefano Bontade, a top Mafia boss, in the mid 1970s. At the time Berlusconi still was just a wealthy real estate developer and started his private television empire. Bontade visited Berlusconi's villa in Arcore through his contact Vittorio Mangano. Berlusconi's lawyer dismissed Giuffrè's testimony as \"false\" and an attempt to discredit the Prime Minister and his party. Giuffrè said that other Mafia representatives who were in contact with Berlusconi included the Palermo Mafia bosses Filippo Graviano and Giuseppe Graviano. The Graviano brothers allegedly treated directly with Berlusconi through the business-man Gianni Letta, somewhere between September/October 1993. The alleged pact with the Mafia fell apart in 2002. Cosa Nostra had achieved nothing.\n\nDell'Utri's lawyer, Enrico Trantino, dismissed Giuffrè’s allegations as an \"anthology of hearsay\". He said Giuffrè had perpetuated the trend that every new turncoat would attack Dell'Utri and the former Christian Democrat prime minister Giulio Andreotti in order to earn money and judicial privileges.\n\nIn October 2009, Gaspare Spatuzza, a Mafioso turned pentito in 2008, has confirmed Giuffrè statements. Spatuzza testified that his boss Giuseppe Graviano had told him in 1994 that Berlusconi was bargaining with the Mafia, concerning a political-electoral agreement between Cosa Nostra and Berlusconi’s Forza Italia. Spatuzza said Graviano disclosed the information to him during a conversation in a bar Graviano owned in the upscale Via Veneto district of the Italian capital Rome. Dell'Utri was the intermediary, according to Spatuzza. Dell'Utri has dismissed Spatuzza's allegations as \"nonsense\". Berlusconi’s lawyer and MP for the PdL, Niccolò Ghedini said that \"the statements given by Spatuzza about prime minister Berlusconi are baseless and can be in no way verified.\"\n\nBerlusconi has a warm relationship with Vladimir Putin.\n\nIn November 2007 Italy’s state-owned energy company Eni signed an agreement with Russian state-owned Gazprom to build the South Stream pipeline. Investigating Italian parliament members discovered that Central Energy Italian Gas Holding (CEIGH), a part of the Centrex Group, was to play a major role in the lucrative agreement. Bruno Mentasti-Granelli, a close friend of Berlusconi, owned 33 percent of CEIGH. Italian parliament blocked the contract and accused Berlusconi of having a personal interest in the Eni-Gazprom agreement.\n\nOn 1 December 2010, Wikileaks leaked American state diplomatic cables showing that American officials voiced concerns over Berlusconi's extraordinary closeness to Putin, \"including 'lavish gifts,' lucrative energy contracts and a 'shadowy' Russian-speaking Italian go-between\". Diplomats consider him \"to be the mouthpiece of Putin\" in Europe.\n\nAccording to one of the leaked cables the Georgian ambassador in Rome has told to the American officials that Georgia believes Putin has promised Berlusconi a percentage of profits from any pipelines developed by Gazprom in coordination with Eni S.p.A..\n\nBerlusconi visited Belarus and met its authoritarian president Alexander Lukashenko in 2009. Berlusconi became the first Western leader to visit Lukashenko since the latter came to power in 1994. In the press conference Berlusconi paid compliments to Lukashenko and said \"Good luck to you and your people, whom I know love you\".\n\nDuring much of Berlusconi's government Italy gradually reconciled with Libya of Muammar Gaddafi. Italy gets a quarter of its oil and about 10% of its gas from Libya, and enterprises from both countries have strong interests in the other economy. Berlusconi's escort girls helped Gaddafi to gain the leadership of the African Union in 2009. During the first days of the 2011 Libyan civil war Berlusconi was initially cautious, painting Libya not as a military priority but a humanitarian one. In the following days the Italian government condemned the use of violence and suspended the friendship treaty with Libya signed in 2008.\n\nAfter the 11 September 2001 attacks in New York, Berlusconi said: \"We must be aware of the superiority of our civilisation, a system that has guaranteed well-being, respect for human rights and – in contrast with Islamic countries – respect for religious and political rights, a system that has as its value understanding of diversity and tolerance.\" This declaration caused an uproar, not only in the Arab and Muslim world, but also all around Europe, including Italy. Subsequently Berlusconi told the press: \"We are aware of the crucial role of moderate Arab countries... I am sorry that words that have been misunderstood have offended the sensitivity of my Arab and Muslim friends.\"\n\nAfter the family of Eluana Englaro (who had been comatose for 17 years) succeeded in having her right to die recognised by the judges and getting doctors to start the process of allowing her to die in the way established by the court, Berlusconi issued a decree to stop the doctor from letting her die. Stating that, \"This is murder. I would be failing to rescue her. I'm not a Pontius Pilate\", Berlusconi went on to defend his decision by claiming that she was \"in the condition to have babies\", arguing that comatose women were still subject to menstruation.\nCritics said that this controversial move had been staged to repair relations with the Vatican, following harsh criticism of the treatment of immigrants by the Berlusconi administration.\n\nBerlusconi has developed a reputation for making gaffes or insensitive remarks.\n\nOn 2 July 2003, Berlusconi suggested that German SPD MEP Martin Schulz, who had criticised his domestic policies, should play a Nazi concentration camp guard in a film. Berlusconi insisted that he was joking, but accused Schulz and others to be \"bad-willing tourists of democracy\". This incident caused a brief cooling of Italy's relationship with Germany.\n\nAddressing traders at the New York Stock Exchange in September 2003, Berlusconi listed a series of reasons to invest in Italy, the first of which was that \"we have the most beautiful secretaries in the world\". This remark resulted in uproar in Italy where female members of parliament took part in a one-day cross-party protest. Berlusconi's list also included the claim that Italy had \"fewer communists, and those who are still here deny having been one\".\n\nIn 2003, during an interview with Nicholas Farrell, then editor of \"The Spectator\", Berlusconi claimed that Mussolini \"had been a benign dictator who did not murder opponents but sent them 'on holiday'\".\nBerlusconi had made disparaging remarks about Finnish cuisine during negotiations to decide on the location of the European Food Safety Authority in 2001. He caused further offence in 2005, when he claimed that during the negotiations he had had to \"dust off his playboy charms\" in order to persuade the Finnish president, Tarja Halonen, to concede that the EFSA should be based in Parma instead of Finland, and compared Finnish smoked reindeer unfavourably to culatello. The Italian ambassador in Helsinki was summoned by the Finnish foreign minister. One of Berlusconi's ministers later 'explained' the comment by saying that \"anyone who had seen a picture of Halonen must have been aware that he had been joking\". Halonen took the incident in good humour, retorting that Berlusconi had \"overestimated his persuasion skills\". The Finnish pizza chain Kotipizza responded by launching a variety of pizza called \"Pizza Berlusconi\", using smoked reindeer as the topping. The pizza won first prize in America's Plate International pizza contest in March 2008.\n\nIn March 2006, Berlusconi alleged that Chinese communists under Mao Zedong had \"boiled [children] to fertilise the fields\". His opponent Romano Prodi criticised Berlusconi for offending the Chinese people and called his comments 'unthinkable'.\n\nIn the run-up to the 2008 Italian general election, Berlusconi was angrily accused of sexism for saying that female politicians from the right were \"more beautiful\" and that \"the left has no taste, even when it comes to women\". In 2008 Berlusconi criticised the composition of the Council of Ministers of the Spanish Government as being too 'pink' by virtue of the fact that it has (once the President of the Council, José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero, is counted) an equal number of men and women. He also stated that he doubted that such a composition would be possible in Italy given the \"prevalence of men\" in Italian politics.\n\nAlso in 2008 Berlusconi caused controversy at a joint press conference with Russian president Vladimir Putin. When Russian journalist Nezavisimaya Gazeta asked a question about Mr. Putin's personal relationships, Berlusconi made a gesture towards the journalist imitating a gunman shooting.\n\nOn 6 November 2008, two days after Barack Obama was elected the first black US President, Berlusconi referred to Obama as \"young, handsome and even tanned\": On 26 March 2009 he said \"I'm paler [than Mr. Obama], because it's been so long since I went sunbathing. He's more handsome, younger and taller.\"\n\nSubsequently, at a tent camp on the outskirts of L'Aquila housing some of the more than 30,000 people who lost their homes during the 2009 earthquake he said to an African priest: \"you have a nice tan.\"\n\nOn 24 January 2009, Berlusconi announced his aim to increase the numbers of military patrolling the Italian cities from 3,000 to 30,000 in order to crack down on what he called an \"evil army\" of criminals. Responding to a female journalist who asked him if this tenfold increase in patrolling soldiers would be enough to secure Italian women from being raped, he said: \"We could not field a big enough force to avoid this risk [of rape]. We would need as many soldiers as beautiful women and I don't think that would be possible, because our women are so beautiful.\" Opposition leaders called the remarks insensitive and in bad taste. Berlusconi retorted that he had merely wanted to compliment Italian women. Other critics accused him of creating a \"police state\".\n\nOn 3 April 2009, Berlusconi appeared to have annoyed Queen Elizabeth II at a photo session during the G20 summit. During the photo session, Berlusconi shouted \"Mr. Obama, Mr. Obama\", prompting her to turn around and chastise Berlusconi, “What is it? Why does he have to shout?”. The following day, at the NATO meeting in Kehl, Berlusconi was seen talking on his mobile phone, while Merkel and other NATO leaders waited for him for a photo on a Rhine bridge (afterwards, Berlusconi claimed he was talking to Turkish Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdoğan about accepting the Secretary Generalship of Anders Fogh Rasmussen). Responding to the Italian media's reaction to these incidents, he said he was considering \"hard measures\" against reporters, and referred to some of their claims as \"slander\".\n\nTwo days after the 2009 L'Aquila earthquake, Berlusconi suggested that people left homeless should view their experience as a camping weekend.\nWhile touring the earthquake site, he asked councillor Lia Beltrami, \"Can I fondle you?\".\n\nIn May 2009, Berlusconi alleged that he had once had to travel three hours to see a two-hundred-year-old church in the Finnish countryside which, in his opinion, would have been demolished if it was in Italy. Berlusconi had made a non-official visit to Finland in 1999 and had never seen any Finnish church, but had just been visiting Iceland.\n\nIn October 2010, Berlusconi was chastised by the Vatican newspaper \"L'Osservatore Romano\" after he was filmed telling \"offensive and deplorable jokes\", including one whose punchline was similar to one of the gravest blasphemies in the Italian language. It was also revealed he had made another anti-Semitic joke a few days previously. Berlusconi responded to the allegations by saying the jokes were \"neither an offence nor a sin, but merely a laugh\".\n\nOn 1 November 2010, after once again being accused of involvement in juvenile prostitution, he suggested that an audience at the Milan trade fair should stop reading newspapers: \"Don't read newspapers any more because they deceive you. [...] I am a man who works hard all day long and if sometimes I look at some good-looking girl, it's better to be fond of pretty girls than to be gay\". The remarks were immediately condemned by Arcigay, Italy's main gay rights organisation, on behalf of both women and gay people; speaking on behalf of the organisation, its president Paolo Patanè said that it was \"unacceptable for a head of government to foster a chauvinistic and vulgar attitude\" with such a statement, and requested that Berlusconi apologise. Politicians including Nichi Vendola, Antonio Di Pietro, and Franco Grillini released similar statements, with the latter commenting that it was \"better to be gay than to be a sex-addicted schemer like Berlusconi.\" Flavia Madaschi, president of Agedo, the Italian equivalent of PFLAG, also commented that it was \"better to be gay than Berlusconi.\" Activists staged an anti-homophobia protest outside Palazzo Chigi.\n\nOn 13 July 2011, according to a leaked telephone surveillance transcript, Berlusconi told his presumed blackmailer Valter Lavitola: \"The only thing they can say about me is that I screw around [...] Now they're spying on me, controlling my phone calls. I don't give a fuck. In a few months [...] I'll be leaving this shit country that makes me sick.\" He had already made a comment about sending a postcard from the Bahamas in 2005.\n\nOn 13 December 2009 Berlusconi was hit in the face with an alabaster statuette of Milan Cathedral after a rally in Milan's \"Piazza del Duomo\". As Berlusconi was shaking hands with the public, a man in the crowd stepped forward and launched the statuette at him. The assailant was subsequently detained and identified as Massimo Tartaglia, a 42-year-old surveyor with a history of mental illness but no criminal record, living in the outskirts of Milan. According to a letter released to the Italian news agency ANSA, Tartaglia has apologised for the attack, writing: \"I don't recognise myself\", and adding that he had \"acted alone [with no] form of militancy or political affiliation\". Berlusconi suffered facial injuries, a broken nose and two broken teeth; he was subsequently hospitalised. Italian president Giorgio Napolitano and politicians from all parties in Italy condemned the attack.\n\nIn the night of 15–16 December a 26-year-old man was stopped by police and Berlusconi's bodyguards while trying to gain access to Berlusconi's hospital room. A search revealed that he carried no weapons, although three hockey sticks and two knives were later found in his car. The suspect was known to have a history of mental illness and mandatory treatment in mental institutions.\n\nBerlusconi was discharged from the hospital on 17 December 2009.\n\nIn December 2007 the audio recording of a phone call between Berlusconi, then leader of the opposition parties, and Agostino Saccà (general director of RAI) were published by the magazine \"L'espresso\" and caused a scandal in several media.\nThe wiretap was part of an investigation by the Public Prosecutor Office of Naples, where Berlusconi was investigated for corruption.\nIn the phone call, Saccà expresses words of impassioned political support to Berlusconi and criticises the behaviour of Berlusconi's allies. Berlusconi urges Saccà to broadcast a telefilm series which was strongly advocated by his ally Umberto Bossi. Saccà laments that many people have spread rumours on this agreement causing problems to him. Then Berlusconi asks Saccà to find a job in RAI for a young woman explicitly telling him that this woman would serve as an asset in a secret exchange with a senator of the majority who would help him to cause Prodi, with his administration, to fall. After the publication of these wiretaps, Berlusconi has been accused by other politicians and by some journalists of political corruption through the exploitation of prostitution. Berlusconi said, in his own defence: \"In the entertainment world everybody knows that, in certain situations in RAI TV you work only if you prostitute yourself or if you are leftist. I have intervened on behalf of some personalities who are not leftists and have been completely set apart by RAI TV.\" In the US State Department's 2011 Trafficking in Persons report authorized by Secretary of State Hillary Clinton Mr. Berlusconi was explicitly named as a person involved in the \"commercial sexual exploitation of a Moroccan child\".\n\nAt the end of April 2009, Veronica Lario wrote an open letter expressing her anger at Berlusconi's choice of young, attractive female candidates—some with little or no political experience—to represent the party in the 2009 European Parliament elections. Berlusconi demanded a public apology, claiming that for the third time his wife had \"done this to me in the middle of an election campaign\", and stated that there was little prospect of his marriage continuing.\nOn 3 May, Veronica Lario announced she was filing for divorce following her husband's attendance at a girl's 18th birthday party in Casoria, Naples. She claimed that Berlusconi had not attended his own sons' 18th birthday parties, and that she \"cannot remain with a man who consorts with minors\" and \"is not well\". Noemi Letizia, the girl in question, gave interviews to the Italian press, revealing that she calls Berlusconi \"papi\" (\"daddy\"), that they often spent time together in the past, and that Berlusconi would take care of her career as showgirl or politician, whichever she opted to pursue.\n\nIn the following days Silvio Berlusconi gave explanations about the incident to press and television, swearing that he knew the girl only through her father and that he never met her alone without her parents.\nHowever, on 14 May, newspaper \"la Repubblica\" published an article showing the many inconsistencies and contradictions arisen so far and formally asking Berlusconi to answer ten questions in order to clarify the situation.\n\nTen days later, Letizia's ex-boyfriend Luigi Flaminio claimed that Berlusconi had contacted the girl personally in October 2008, impressed by her \"purity\" and \"angelic face\" after seeing pictures of her in a photobook, brought to him by the journalist Emilio Fede (director of TG4). Flaminio also mentioned that she had spent a week without her parents at Berlusconi's Sardinian villa around New Year's Eve 2009, a fact confirmed later by her mother. Photographs of the event taken by a paparazzo were confiscated by the Prosecutor's Office of Rome for violation of privacy but a selection of those photos was published in \"El País\" on 4 June.\n\nOn 28 May 2009, Silvio Berlusconi said that he had never had \"spicy\" relations with Noemi Letizia, swearing also on his children's heads. He said also that if any such thing had occurred, he would have resigned immediately.\n\nOn 17 June 2009, Patrizia D'Addario, a 42-year old escort and retired actress from Bari, Italy, claimed that she had been recruited twice (by a mutual friend, who paid her 2000 Euros) in order to spend the evening, and once also the night, with Berlusconi.\nMagistrates in Bari are investigating this case, since the friend could be prosecuted for favouring prostitution.\n\nSilvio Berlusconi denied any knowledge of D'Addario being a paid escort: \"I have never paid a woman… I have never understood what satisfaction there is if the pleasure of conquest is absent\". He also accused an unspecified person of manoeuvring and paying D'Addario (accusations which she vehemently denied).\n\nOther young women have also described to the press the parties held in Berlusconi's Rome residence (Palazzo Grazioli), while photos and transcripts of audio cassettes circulated widely in the press. These descriptions have raised, in particular, concerns about the lack of security measures and the uncontrolled access to the prime minister's residence.\n\nOn 26 June 2009, the \"10 questions\" to Berlusconi were reformulated by \"la Repubblica\" newspaper, and then frequently republished on it. No answers were given, until 28 August 2009, when Berlusconi sued Gruppo Editoriale L'Espresso, the owner company of the newspaper, and defined these ten questions as \"defamatory\" and \"rhetorical\".\n\nBerlusconi's lifestyle has raised eyebrows in Catholic circles, with vigorous criticism being expressed in particular by the newspaper \"Avvenire\", owned by the Conferenza Episcopale Italiana (Conference of Italian Bishops). This was followed by the publication in the newspaper il Giornale (owned by the Berlusconi family) of details with regard to legal proceedings against the editor of \"Avvenire\", Dino Boffo, which seemed to implicate him for a harassment case against the wife of his ex-partner. Dino Boffo has always declared the details of the proceedings to be false, although he has not denied the basic premise.\n\nAfter a period of tense exchanges and polemics, on 3 September 2009, Boffo resigned from his editorial position and the assistant editor Marco Tarquinio became editor \"ad interim\".\n\nOn 22 September 2009, after a press conference, Silvio Berlusconi declared that he had asked his ministers not to respond anymore to questions regarding \"gossip\". He stated also that the Italian press should talk only about the \"successes\" of Italian Government in internal and foreign policies, adding also that the press now will be able only to ask questions such as \"how many apartments will be given in L'Aquila\", i.e. relating to his administration and not to gossip.\n\nDuring a contested episode of \"AnnoZero\" on 1 October 2009, the journalist and presenter Michele Santoro interviewed Patrizia D'Addario. She stated she was contacted by Giampaolo Tarantini – a businessman from Bari – who already knew her and requested her presence at Palazzo Grazioli with \"the President\". D'Addario also stated that Berlusconi knew that she was a paid escort.\n\nIn November 2010, teenage Moroccan belly dancer and alleged prostitute Karima El Mahroug (better known as \"Ruby Rubacuori\") claimed to have been given $10,000 by Berlusconi at parties at his private villas. The girl told prosecutors in Milan that these events were like orgies where Berlusconi and 20 young women performed an African-style ritual known as the \"bunga bunga\" in the nude.\nIt was also found out that, on 27 May 2010, El Mahroug had been arrested for theft by the Milan police but (being still a minor) she was directed to a shelter for juvenile offenders. However, following two telephone calls by Berlusconi to the police authorities (in which, in particular, he falsely indicated that El Mahroug was a close relative of President Hosni Mubarak of Egypt), the young woman was released and entrusted to the care of PDL regional counselor (and Berlusconi's personal dental hygienist) Nicole Minetti.\nThe investigation of Berlusconi for extortion (\"\") and child prostitution regarding Karima El Mahroug has been referred to as \"Rubygate\". MP Gaetano Pecorella proposed to lower the age of majority in Italy to solve the case.\n\nBerlusconi has also come under fire for reportedly spending $1.8 million in state funds from RAI Cinema to further the career of a largely unknown Bulgarian actress, Michelle Bonev. The fact that this coincided with severe cuts being made to the country's arts budget provoked a strong reaction from the public.\n\nOn 24 June 2013, Berlusconi was convicted for paying for sex with Karima El Mahroug and sentenced to seven years in prison, although his sentence will not start until after the appeal process is concluded.\n\n"}

He is a Democrat. The district includes Hell’s Kitchen, Chelsea, the West Village, and parts of Flatiron, SoHo and the Upper West Side in Manhattan.\n\nPrior to his election as Speaker, Johnson was frequently named as a potential candidate, and was perceived as a leading contender. In mid-December 2017, with the public support of Mayor de Blasio, the concession of other front runners, and backing of the Bronx and Queens Democratic Parties, Johnson corralled the requisite number of votes to become the presumptive favorite for the position, with the full Council voting on January 3, 2018.\n\nJohnson was raised in Middleton, Massachusetts, in a union household by his mother, Ann Queenan Richardson, a homeless services provider, and his step-father, Rodney Richardson, a Teamster. Johnson's birth father, David Johnson, was born to an American father and Korean mother in South Korea.\n\nJohnson made national headlines in 2000 when, as captain of his high school football team at Masconomet Regional High School, he publicly revealed that he was gay. His story was reported by major national news outlets including \"The New York Times\" and \"20/20\".\n\nShortly after graduating high school, Johnson moved to New York City and became engaged in LGBT rights activism, after only spending less than one semester at George Washington University. Johnson was a contributor and eventually the political director of the LGBT blog Towleroad.\n\nIn 2005, Johnson joined Manhattan Community Board 4 (CB4), to which he said in 2014 “You don’t spend eight years on the community board because it’s sexy,”, “You’re on the community board because you care about the community.” In 2011, Johnson was elected Chair of CB4, becoming the youngest Community Board Chair in New York City at the time. In 2011, Johnson was profiled by \"City & State\" as a \"rising star\" in New York City politics.\n\nIn 2013, Christine Quinn ran for Mayor of New York City as her term in the City Council was expiring. Johnson, then Chair of Community Board 4, ran to succeed Quinn and was elected in November 2013 with 86% of the vote. Johnson assumed office on January 1, 2014. As of December 2016, Johnson had passed 18 pieces of legislation.\n\nAmong his key areas of focus have been strengthening rent regulation and tenant protection, and enhancing services for New Yorkers with HIV and AIDS.

The legislation effectively banned chewing tobacco from professional baseball in New York City. A similar ban had previously been enacted in cities including San Francisco, Boston, Los Angeles, and Chicago.\n\nJohnson’s legislation to require transparency regarding health services administered at Rikers Island was signed into law on June 16, 2015.\n\nJohnson’s legislation requiring automated external defibrillators to be present at public ball fields in New York City, which was co-sponsored by Minority Leader Steven Matteo, was passed by the City Council on April 20, 2016 and signed into law on May 10, 2016.\n\nOn August 16, 2016, the City Council passed legislation introduced by Johnson and Council Speaker Melissa Mark-Viverito to create a City office responsible for the coordination of social and healthcare services for individuals who have been released from the New York City Department of Correction.\n\nIn 2014, Council Member Johnson introduced legislation that removed surgical requirements for transgender New Yorkers to correct their birth certificates. The legislation passed the City Council on December 8, 2014 and was adopted on January 8, 2015.\n\nJohnson’s first legislation to pass the City Council was a bill that granted a presumption of eligibility for people transitioning from domestic violence shelters to Department of Homeless Services shelters. The bill allows these individuals to bypass extensive intake procedures that they already underwent during their first shelter placement.\n\nJohnson introduced legislation with Council Member Vanessa Gibson to require the Department of Education to report on the use of disciplinary measures in public schools. The legislation was passed on September 30, 2015 and signed into law on October 13, 2015.\n\nJohnson later introduced legislation requiring the Department of Education to regularly report on student health services in public schools, to ensure that such services are adequately serving New York City students.

{"id": "7559856", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=7559856", "title": "Criticism of Muhammad", "text": "Criticism of Muhammad\n\nCriticism of Muhammad has existed since the 7th century, when Muhammad was decried by his non-Muslim Arab contemporaries for preaching monotheism, and by the Jewish tribes of Arabia for his unwarranted appropriation of Biblical narratives and figures, vituperation of the Jewish faith, and proclaiming himself as \"the last prophet\" without performing any miracle nor showing any personal requirement demanded in the Hebrew Bible to distinguish a true prophet chosen by the God of Israel from a false claimant; for these reasons, they gave him the derogatory nickname \"ha-Meshuggah\" (, \"the Madman\" or \"the Possessed\"). During the Middle Ages various Western and Byzantine Christian thinkers considered Muhammad to be a perverted, deplorable man, a false prophet, and even the Antichrist, as he was frequently seen in Christendom as a heretic or possessed by the demons. Some of them, like Thomas Aquinas, criticised Muhammad's promises of carnal pleasure in the afterlife.\n\nModern religious and secular criticism of Islam has concerned Muhammad's sincerity in claiming to be a prophet, his morality, his ownership of slaves, his treatment of enemies, his marriages, his treatment of doctrinal matters, and his psychological condition. Muhammad has been accused of sadism and mercilessness— including the invasion of the Banu Qurayza tribe in Medina—sexual relationships with slaves, and his marriage to Aisha when she was six years old, which according to most estimates was consummated when she was nine.\n\nMany early former Muslims such as Ibn al-Rawandi, Al-Ma'arri, and Abu Isa al-Warraq were famous religious skeptics, polymaths, and philosophers that criticized Islam, the alleged authority and reliability of the Qu'ran, Muhammad's morality, and his claims to be a prophet.\n\nIn the Middle Ages, it was common for Jewish writers to describe Muhammad as \"ha-Meshuggah\" (\"The Madman\"), a term of contempt frequently used in the Bible for those who believe themselves to be prophets.\n\nThe earliest documented Christian knowledge of Muhammad stems from Byzantine sources, written shortly after Muhammad's death in 632. In the \"Doctrina Jacobi nuper baptizati\", a dialogue between a recent Christian convert and several Jews, one participant writes that his brother \"wrote to [him] saying that a deceiving prophet has appeared amidst the Saracens\". Another participant in the \"Doctrina\" replies about Muhammad: \"He is deceiving. For do prophets come with sword and chariot?, …[Y]ou will discover nothing true from the said prophet except human bloodshed\".\nOne Christian who came under the early dominion of the Islamic Caliphate was John of Damascus (c. 676–749 AD), who was familiar with Islam and Arabic. The second chapter of his book, \"The Fount of Wisdom\", titled \"Concerning Heresies\", presents a series of discussions between Christians and Muslims. John claimed that an Arian monk (whom he did not know was Bahira) influenced Muhammad and the writer viewed the Islamic doctrines as nothing more than a hodgepodge culled from the Bible. Among the first sources representing Muhammad is the polemical work \"Concerning Heresy\" (Perì hairéseōn) of John of Damascus, translated from Greek into Latin. In this manuscript, the Syrian priest represents Muhammad as a \"false prophet,\" and an \"Antichrist\". Some demonstrate that Muhammad was pointed out in this manuscript as \"Mamed\", but this study was corrected by Ahlam Sbaihat who affirmed that it is the form ΜΩΑΜΕθ (Moameth) which is mentioned in this manuscript. The phoneme h and the gemination of m do not exist in Greek so it has disappeared from John's uses.\n\nFrom the 9th century onwards, highly negative biographies of Muhammad were written in Latin, such as the one by Álvaro of Córdoba proclaiming him the Antichrist. Since the 7th century, Muhammad and his name have been connected to several stereotypes. Many sources mentioned exaggerated and sometimes wrong stereotypes. These stereotypes are born in the East but adopted by or developed in Western cultures. These references played a principal role in introducing Muhammad and his religion to the West as the false prophet, Saracen prince or deity, the Biblical beast, a schismatic from Christianity and a satanic creature, and the Antichrist.\n\nDuring the 12th century Peter the Venerable, who saw Muhammad as the precursor to the Anti-Christ and the successor of Arius, ordered the translation of the Qur'an into Latin (Lex Mahumet pseudoprophete) and the collection of information on Muhammad so that Islamic teachings could be refuted by Christian scholars. During the 13th century a series of works by European scholars such as Pedro Pascual, Ricoldo de Monte Croce, and Ramon Llull depicted Muhammad as an Antichrist and argued that Islam was a Christian heresy.\n\nThe fact that Muhammad was unlettered, that he married a wealthy widow, that in his later life he had several wives, that he ruled over a human community, was involved in several wars, and that he died like an ordinary person in contrast to the Christian belief in the supernatural end of Christ's earthly life were all arguments used to discredit Muhammad. One common allegation laid against Muhammad was that he was an impostor who, in order to satisfy his ambition and his lust, propagated religious teachings that he knew to be false. Some medieval ecclesiastical writers portrayed Muhammad as possessed by Satan, a \"precursor of the Antichrist\" or the Antichrist himself. In Dante's The Divine Comedy, Muhammad dwells in the 9th \"Bolgia\" of the Eighth Circle of Hell and is depicted as disemboweled; the contrapasso represented thereby implicates Muhammad as a schismatic, figuratively rending the body of the Catholic Church and compromising the integrity of the truth of Christianity in the same way Muhammad's body is depicted as literally wounded.\nA more positive interpretation appears in the 13th-century \"Estoire del Saint Grail\", the first book in the vast Arthurian cycle, the Lancelot-Grail. In describing the travels of Joseph of Arimathea, keeper of the Holy Grail, the author says that most residents of the Middle East were pagans until the coming of Muhammad, who is shown as a true prophet sent by God to bring Christianity to the region. This mission however failed when Muhammad's pride caused him to alter God's wishes, thereby deceiving his followers. Nevertheless, Muhammad's religion is portrayed as being greatly superior to paganism.\n\nThe \"Tultusceptrum de libro domni Metobii\", an Andalusian manuscript with unknown dating, recounts how Muhammad (called Ozim, from Hashim) was tricked by Satan into adulterating an originally pure divine revelation. The story argues God was concerned about the spiritual fate of the Arabs and wanted to correct their deviation from the faith. He then sends an angel to the monk Osius who orders him to preach to the Arabs. Osius however is in ill-health and orders a young monk, Ozim, to carry out the angel's orders instead. Ozim sets out to follow his orders, but gets stopped by an evil angel on the way. The ignorant Ozim believes him to be the same angel that spoke to Osius before. The evil angel modifies and corrupts the original message given to Ozim by Osius, and renames Ozim Muhammad. From this followed the erroneous teachings of Islam, according to the \"Tultusceptrum\".\n\nThomas Aquinas was highly critical of Muhammad's character and ethics, claiming that his teachings were largely in conformity to his immoral lifestyle. He wrote in Summa Contra Gentiles:\n\n\"“[Muhammad] seduced the people by promises of carnal pleasure to which the concupiscence of the flesh goads us. His teaching also contained precepts that were in conformity with his promises, and he gave free rein to carnal pleasure. In all this, as is not unexpected, he was obeyed by carnal men. As for proofs of the truth of his doctrine, he brought forward only such as could be grasped by the natural ability of anyone with a very modest wisdom... Nor do divine pronouncements on the part of preceding prophets offer him any witness. On the contrary, he perverts almost all the testimonies of the Old and New Testaments by making them into fabrications of his own, as can be seen by anyone who examines his law. It was, therefore, a shrewd decision on his part to forbid his followers to read the Old and New Testaments, lest these books convict him of falsity. It is thus clear that those who place any faith in his words believe foolishly.” \n\nMartin Luther referred to Muhammad as \"a devil and first-born child of Satan.\" Luther's primary target of criticism at the time was the Pope, and Luther's characterization of Muhammad was intended to draw a comparison to show that the Pope was worse.\n\nIn the early 20th century Western scholarly views of Muhammad changed, including critical views. In the 1911 \"Catholic Encyclopedia\" Gabriel Oussani states that Muhammad was inspired by an \"imperfect understanding\" of Judaism and Christianity, but that the views of Luther and those who call Muhammad a \"wicked impostor\", a \"dastardly liar\" and a \"willful deceiver\" are an \"indiscriminate abuse\" and \"unsupported by facts.\" Instead, 19th-century Western scholars such as Aloys Sprenger, Theodor Noldeke, Gustav Weil, William Muir, Sigismund Koelle, Grimme and D.S. Margoliouth \"give us a more correct and unbiased estimate of Muhammad's life and character, and substantially agree as to his motives, prophetic call, personal qualifications, and sincerity.\"\n\nMuir, Marcus Dods and others have suggested that Muhammad was at first sincere, but later became deceptive. Koelle finds \"the key to the first period of Muhammad's life in Khadija, his first wife,\" after whose death he became prey to his \"evil passions.\" Samuel Marinus Zwemer, a Christian missionary, criticised the life of Muhammad by the standards of the Old and New Testaments, by the pagan morality of his Arab compatriots, and last, by the new law which he brought. Quoting Johnstone, Zwemer concludes by claiming that his harsh judgment rests on evidence which \"comes all from the lips and the pens of his [i.e. Muhammad's] own devoted adherents.\"\n\nIn his 1875 work Satyarth Prakash, Dayanand Saraswati, the founder of Arya Samaj, quoted and interpreted several verses of the Koran and described Muhammad as \"pugnacious\", an \"imposter\", and one who held out \"a bait to men and women, in the name of God, to compass his own selfish needs.\" Swami Vivekananda wrote in his 1896 book Raja Yoga that though Muhammad was inspired, \"he was not a trained \"Yogi\", nor did he know the reason of what he was doing.\" Vivekananda wrote that great evil has been done through Muhammad's fanaticism with \"whole countries destroyed\" and \"millions upon millions of people killed.\"\n\nIn the 1920s, three caricatures published by Hindus attacked Muhammad and marriages—the book \"Vichitra Jivan\" (meaning \"Strange Life\") by Pandit Kalicharan Sharma in 1923, the pamphlet \"Rangila Rasul\" (meaning \"The Colourful Prophet\") by an anonymous author going by the pseudonym of Pandit Chamupati in 1924, and the essay \"Sair-i-Dozakh\" (meaning \"The Trip to Hell\") by Devi Sharan Sharma in 1927. In \"Vichitra Jivan\", Sharma wrote that Muhammad fell victim to many evils, all his marriages were extraordinary and improper, and that he suffered from epilepsy.\n\nSharma examined in detail the \"marvelous powers\" of Muhammad, the \"products of his body\", and every feature of his \"marital and sexual relations\", and ended the book by saying that such a person could not have been a divine messenger. The \"Sair-i-Dozakh\" was a take on the Isra and Mi'raj, Muhammad's journey to heaven and hell according to Islamic traditions. Described as a \"brutal satire\" by Gene Thursby, it described a dream purportedly experienced by the author in which he mounts a mysterious animal and sees various Hindu and Sikh deities and Gurus in the realm of salvation.\n\nJai Maharaj, sponsor of the \"Satyameva Jayate\" website, wrote that Muhammad was \"in fact a terrorist, criminal and murderer whose entire life was based on victimizing innocents and indulging in mindless violence, carnage and massacre.\" Maharaj chronicled what he called were Muhammad's \"criminal acts in the form of battles and murders\", including the killing of four merchants during the sacred month of Rajab, the killing of 70 merchants and 900 men from Mecca, the killing of the poets 'Asma' bint Marwan and Abu 'Afak, and the initial motivation to kill followed by eventual expelling of the Jewish tribe of Banu Qaynuqa.\n\n\"Mahomet\" (French: \"Le fanatisme, ou Mahomet le Prophète\", literally \"Fanaticism, or Mahomet the Prophet\") is a five-act tragedy written in 1736 by French playwright and philosopher Voltaire. It made its debut performance in Lille on 25 April 1741. The play is a study of religious fanaticism and self-serving manipulation based on an episode in the traditional biography of Muhammad in which he orders the murder of his critics. Voltaire described the play as \"written in opposition to the founder of a false and barbarous sect to whom could I with more propriety inscribe a satire on the cruelty and errors of a false prophet\".\n\nIn a letter to Frederick II of Prussia in 1740 Voltaire ascribes to Muhammad a brutality that \"is assuredly nothing any man can excuse\" and suggests that his following stems from superstition and lack of Enlightenment. He wanted to portray Muhammad as \"Tartuffe with a sword in his hand.\"\n\nModern critics have criticized Muhammad for preaching beliefs that are incompatible with democracy; Somali-Dutch feminist writer Ayaan Hirsi Ali has called him a \"tyrant\" and a \"pervert\". The Dutch Party for Freedom leader Geert Wilders calls Muhammad a \"mass murderer and a pedophile\".\n\nNeuroscientist and prominent ideological critic Sam Harris contrasts the example of Muhammad with that of Jesus Christ. While he regards Christ as something of a \"hippie\" figure, Muhammad is an altogether different character and one whose example \"as held in Islam is universally not [that of] a pacifist,\" but rather one of a \"conquering warlord who spread the faith by the sword.\" Harris notes that while sayings such as \"render unto Caesar that which is Caesar's\" provide Christianity with a \"rationale for peace,\" it is impossible to justify non-violence as central to Islam. Harris says that the example of Muhammad provides an imperative to \"convert, subjugate, or kill\" and \"the core principle of Islam is Jihad.\" Harris also suggests that Muhammad \"may well have been schizophrenic,\" dismissing Muhammad's claim that the Koran was dictated to him by the archangel Gabriel.\n\nAmerican historian Daniel Pipes sees Muhammad as a politician, stating that \"because Muhammad created a new community, the religion that was its raison d'être had to meet the political needs of its adherents.\"\n\nIn 2012 a film titled \"Innocence of Muslims\" and alternatively \"The Real Life of Muhammad\" and \"Muhammad Movie Trailer\" was released by Nakoula Basseley Nakoula. A \"Vanity Fair\" article described the video as \"Exceptionally amateurish, with disjointed dialogue, jumpy editing, and performances that would have looked melodramatic even in a silent movie, the clip is clearly designed to offend Muslims, portraying Mohammed as a bloodthirsty murderer and Lothario and pedophile with omnidirectional sexual appetites.\" Reacting to the release of the film, violent demonstrations and attacks targeted western institutions through the Muslim world.\n\nAccording to contemporary historians, Muhammad had no intention to abolish slavery, which was already practiced in pre-Islamic Arabia, as he saw it \"as part of the natural order of things\", but rather he wanted to reform it to improve the condition of slaves, and exhorted his followers to treat them more humanely. Muhammad made it legal for his men to marry their slaves and the women they captured in war, giving them full marriage rights. In addition, according to Muslim theologians, he made it lawful for male masters to have sexual relations with female captives and slaves.\n\nRodney Stark argues that \"the fundamental problem facing Muslim theologians vis-à-vis the morality of slavery is that \"Muhammad bought, sold, captured, and owned slaves\"\", though he states that Muhammad did advise that slaves be treated well: \"Feed them what you eat yourself and clothe them with what you wear...They are God's people like unto you and be kind unto them\". In addition, Stark contrasts Islam with Christianity, implying that Christian theologians wouldn't have been able to \"work their way around the biblical acceptance of slavery\" if Jesus had owned slaves like Muhammad did.\n\nSome Western thinkers and Christian evangelicals criticize Muhammad for having had a child (Ibrahim, who died in infancy) by a slave girl called Maria al-Qibtiyya, one of his concubines who was a present from the Christian Byzantine ruler of Egypt. Sources, including Ibn Qayyim Al-Jawziyya claim that she was a concubine and not a slave. She is also not mentioned in Ibn-Hisham's notes on Ibn-Ishaq's biography where he lists the wives of Muhammad. According to a hadith, Muhammad left no slaves at the time of his death.\n\nOne of the five pillars of Islam (according to the Sunnis), or one of the five Furoo-e-Deen (\"Branches of Religion,\" according to Shi'as), Zakat is meant to encourage Muslims to donate money to free slaves and bonded labourers in countries where slaves and bonded labourers may have existed. The amount of zakat to be paid on capital assets (e.g. money) is 2.5% (1/40) for people who are not poor. Muhammad would send his companions like Abu Bakr and Uthman ibn Affan to buy slaves to free. Many early converts to Islam were the poor and former slaves like Bilal ibn Rabah al-Habashi.\n\nMuhammad emphasized the kind treatment of slaves and torturing or mistreating them was forbidden in Islam. Still, the Arab slave trade lasted until the 20th century, and involved from 12 to 15 million persons; slaves (Africans especially) were frequently mistreated, castrated, and emasculated by the Arabs in the Muslim world.\n\nNorman Geisler accuses Muhammad of \"mercilessness\" towards the Jewish tribes of Medina. Geisler also argues that Muhammad \"had no aversion to politically expedient assassinations,\" \"was not indisposed to breaking promises when he found it advantageous\" and \"engaged in retaliation towards those who mocked him.\" The Orientalist William Muir, in assessing Muhammad's character, described him as cruel and faithless in dealing with his enemies.\n\nJean de Sismondi suggests that Muhammad had a specific animosity against Jews, because of the few differences that separated two mostly similar cults. He is among the historians suggesting that he killed many Jews through supplice, whereas he was usually known for his clemency.\n\nMuhammad has been often criticized outside of the Islamic world for his treatment of the Jewish tribes of Medina. An example is the mass killing of the men of the Banu Qurayza, a Jewish tribe of Medina. The tribe was accused of having engaged in treasonous agreements with the enemies besieging Medina in the Battle of the Trench in 627.\n\nIbn Ishaq writes that Muhammad approved the beheading of some 600–700 in all, with some saying as high as 800–900, who surrendered after a siege that lasted several weeks. (Also see Bukhari ) (Yusuf Ali notes that the Qur'an discusses this battle in verses ). They were buried in a mass grave in the Medina market place, and the women and children were sold into slavery.\n\nAccording to Norman Stillman, the incident cannot be judged by present-day moral standards. Citing Deut. 20:13–14 as an example, Stillman states that the slaughter of adult males and the enslavement of women and children—though no doubt causing bitter suffering—was common practice throughout the ancient world. According to Rudi Paret, adverse public opinion was more a point of concern to Muhammad when he had some date palms cut down during a siege, than after this incident. Esposito also argues that in Muhammad's time, traitors were executed and points to similar situations in the Bible. Esposito says that Muhammad's motivation was political rather than racial or theological; he was trying to establish Muslim dominance and rule in Arabia.\n\nSome historians, such as W.N. Arafat and Barakat Ahmad, have disputed the historicity of the incident. Ahmad argues that only the leading members of the tribe were killed. Arafat argued based on accounts by Malik ibn Anas and Ibn Hajar that Ibn Ishaq gathered information from descendants of the Qurayza Jews, who exaggerated the details of the incident. He also maintained that not all adult males were killed but only those who actually fought in the battle, however, William Montgomery Watt described this argument as \"not entirely convincing.\"\n\nRobert Spencer pointed out that Muhammad said in one Sunni Hadith: \n\nFurthermore, Muhammad said in another Sunni Hadith: \n\nAnd another Sunni Hadith:\n\nAccording to one account, after the last fort of the Jewish settlement called Khaybar was taken by Muhammad and his men, the chief of the Jews, called Kinana ibn al-Rabi, was asked by Muhammad to reveal the location of some hidden treasure. When he refused, Muhammad ordered a man to torture Kinana, and the man \"kindled a fire with flint and steel on his chest until he was nearly dead.\" Kinana was then beheaded, and Muhammad took his young wife Safiyya as a concubine.\n\nCritics take these events, especially the story of the torture of Kinana, to be another blot on Muhammad's character. Those few Western scholars who discuss the alleged torture of Kinana, like William Muir, have generally not questioned the validity of the story. Muslims generally dispute this incident. Some claim that this was yet another story that Ibn Ishaq heard second-hand from Jewish sources, casting doubt on its authenticity. Others argue that Kinana was killed in battle and never taken captive.\n\nOne of the popular historical criticisms of Muhammad in the West has been his polygynous marriages. According to American historian John Esposito, the Semitic cultures in general permitted polygamy (for example, the practice could be found in biblical and postbiblical Judaism); it was particularly a common practice among Arabs, especially among nobles and leaders.\n\nMuslims have often pointed out that Muhammad married Khadija (a widow whose age is estimated to have been 40), when he was 25 years old, and remained monogamous to her for more than 24 years until she died. Norman Geisler frames Muhammad's marriages as a question of moral inconsistency, since Muhammad was unwilling to abide by the revealed limit of four wives that he enjoined on other men. The Quran states that the limit of four wives does not apply to Muhammad. Muslims have generally responded that the marriages of Muhammad were not conducted to satisfy worldly desires or lusts, but rather they were done for a higher purpose and due to God's command. Medieval Sufi, Ibn Arabi, sees Muhammad's relationships with his wives as a proof of his superiority amongst men. John Esposito states that polygamy served multiple purposes, including solidifying political alliances among Arab chiefs and marrying widows of companions who died in combat that needed protection.\n\nFrom the 20th century onwards, a common point of contention has been Muhammad's marriage to Aisha, who was said to have been six or seven when betrothed to Muhammad in traditional Islamic sources, and nine, or according to Ibn Hisham, ten, when the marriage was consummated upon her reaching puberty. American historian Denise Spellberg states that \"these specific references to the bride's age reinforce Aisha's pre-menarcheal status and, implicitly, her virginity.\" Muslim authors who calculate Aisha's age based on the more detailed information available about her sister Asma estimate that she was over thirteen and perhaps between seventeen and nineteen at the time of her marriage. Some narrations such as the following mention her menstruating: \"Narrated 'Aisha: The Prophet used to lean on my lap and recite Qur'an while I was in menses.\" and \"Narrated 'Aisha: The Prophet used to embrace me during my menses. He also used to put his head out of the mosque while he was in Itikaf, and I would wash it during my menses.\"\n\nColin Turner, a UK professor of Islamic studies, states that marriages between an older man and a young girl, consummated once the wife reached what was considered at the time to be adult age, were customary among the Bedouins, and hence Muhammad's marriage would not have been considered improper by his contemporaries. Karen Armstrong, the British author on comparative religion, has affirmed that \"There was no impropriety in Muhammad's marriage to Aisha. Marriages conducted in absentia to seal an alliance were often contracted at this time between adults and minors who were even younger than Aisha. This practice continued in Europe well into the early modern period.\"\n\nCritics such as Baptist pastor Jerry Vines and the Dutch Party for Freedom leader Geert Wilders have cited the age of Aisha to denounce Muhammad for having had sex with a nine-year-old, referring to Muhammad as a pedophile. An early 20th-century adherent of the Arya Samaji Hindu movement wrote in \"Rangila Rasul\" that Aisha was about the same age as Muhammad's granddaughter, and a better way for Muhammad to make Abu Bakr (Aisha's father) a relative would have been to adopt Aisha as his own daughter and marry her off. It is described in \"Bukhari\" that Aisha, while living with Muhammad, used to play with dolls along with her girlfriends. According to Katherine Zoepf, this description emphasising Aisha's childishness despite being married to a man then in his early fifties \"can make for upsetting reading.\" Jeremy Stangroom and Ophelia Benson argue that Aisha \"was much too young to have offered anything like her informed consent [for marriage], even if it had been sought\". They also argue, \"there are difficulties in dismissing any of Muhammad's actions as simply being the product of his time given the status accorded to his life among Muslims.\" They note that his life is considered exemplary for Muslims and one to which all Muslim men should aspire, quoting Kecia Ali: \"accepting the rightness of his act raises the question: on what basis can one reject the marriage of young girls today?\" Stangroom and Benson compare the practice of child marriage to that of colonial slavery, arguing that both practices were legal at the time but are now seen as inherently immoral.\n\nWestern criticism has focused especially on the marriage of Muhammad to his first cousin Zaynab bint Jahsh, the divorced wife of Zayd ibn Harithah, an ex-slave whom Muhammad had adopted as his son. According to Tabari, taken from Al-Waqidi, the story goes that \"One day Muhammad went out looking for Zayd. There was a covering of haircloth over the doorway, but the wind had lifted the covering so that the doorway was uncovered. Zaynab was in her chamber, undressed, and admiration for her entered the heart of the Prophet. After that Allah made her unattractive to Zayd and he divorced Zainab.\" Karen Armstrong's 2006 biography of Muhammad contextualises this: \"A pious woman, [Zaynab] was a skilled leather-worker and gave all the proceeds of her craft to the poor. Muhammad seems to have seen her with new eyes and to have fallen in love quite suddenly when he had called at her house one afternoon to speak to Zayd, who happened to be out. Not expecting any visitors, Zaynab had come to the door in dishabille, more revealingly dressed than usual, and Muhammad had averted his eyes hastily, muttering 'Praise be to Allah, who changes men's hearts!'\"\n\nAccording to William Montgomery Watt, Zaynab herself was working for marriage with Muhammad and was not happy being married to Zayd. Watt also places doubt on the story outlined by Al-Waqidi and states that it should be taken with a \"grain of salt.\" According to Watt, Zaynab was either thirty-five or thirty-eight years old at the time and that the story initially outlined by Al-Waqidi in which he detailed Muhammad's incident with Zaynab during the absence of Zayd may have been tampered with in the course of transmission. According to Mazheruddin Siddiqi, Zaynab as the cousin of Muhammad was seen by him many times before her marriage to Zayd. Siddiqi states: \"He [Muhammad] had seen her many times before but he was never attracted to her physical beauty, else he would have married her, instead of insisting on her that she should marry Zaid.\"\n\nAccording to the English translation of the book, \"The Wives of the Messenger of Allah\" by Muhammad Swaleh Awadh, it states that she was married to Muhammad in Dhul Qa'adah, in the fifth year of Hijra. Since Zaynab was the wife of Muhammad's adopted son, pre-Islamic practices frowned upon such her marriage with the prophet. Arab society would have viewed this union as profoundly wrong; because they considered an adopted son was truly a \"son\", for a man to marry his adopted son's wife—even if she was divorced—was considered wrong.\n\nThe marriage was used by Munafiqs of Medina to discredit Muhammad on two fronts, one of double standards as she was his fifth wife, while everyone else was restricted to four, and marrying his adopted son's wife. This was exactly what Muhammad feared and was initially hesitant in marrying her. The Qur'an, however, confirmed that this marriage was valid. Thus Muhammad, confident of his faith in the Qur'an, proceeded to reject the existing Arabic norms. When Zaynab's waiting period from her divorce was complete, Muhammad married her. In reference to this incident, Sura Al-Ahzab says:\n\nAfter this verse was announced, Muhammad proceeded to reject the existing Arabic norms on the prohibition to marry the wives of adopted sons, which was considered extremely wrong and incestuous among Arabs. Thereafter the legal status of adoption was not recognised under Islam. Zayd reverted to being known by his original name of \"Zayd ibn Harithah\" instead of \"Zayd ibn Muhammad\".\n\nOrientalists and critics have pointed to this Sura as an example of a self-serving revelation that merely reflects Muhammad's own lust and sexual desires rather than the will of God.\n\nJohn Mason Neale (1818–1866) accused Muhammad of pandering to his followers, arguing that he constructed Islam out of a mixture of beliefs that provided something for everyone.\n\nThomas Patrick Hughes (b. 1838) argued that the Hajj represents an expedient compromise between Muhammad's monotheistic principles and Arabian paganism.\n\nIslamic scholar Yasir Qadhi stated that while non-Muslims believe Muhammad \"adopted certain things from paganism and then added his own two cents for us\", he instead states that Muhammad resurrected the original teachings of the Islamic prophet Ibrahim, citing an Islamic narrative of a man named Amr Ibn Luhay who later introduced paganism in Arabia. Muḥammad ibn ʻAbd Allāh Azraqī mentions the story his book titled \"Kitāb akhbār Makkah\".\"\"\nMuhammad is reported to have had mysterious seizures at the moments of inspiration. According to Philip Schaff (1819–1893), during his revelations Muhammad \"sometimes growled like a camel, foamed at his mouth, and streamed with perspiration.\" Welch, a scholar of Islamic studies, in the Encyclopedia of Islam states that the graphic descriptions of Muhammad's condition at these moments may be regarded as genuine, since they are unlikely to have been invented by later Muslims. According to Welch, these seizures should have been the most convincing evidence for the superhuman origin of Muhammad's inspirations for people around him. Others adopted alternative explanations for these seizures and claimed that he was possessed, a soothsayer, or a magician. Welch states it remains uncertain whether Muhammad had such experiences before he began to see himself as a prophet and if so how long did he have such experiences.\n\nAccording to Temkin, the first attribution of \"epileptic\" seizures to Muhammad comes from the 8th century Byzantine historian Theophanes who wrote that Muhammad’s wife \"was very much grieved that she, being of noble descent, was tied to such a man, who was not only poor but epileptic as well.\" In the Middle Ages, the general perception of those who suffered epilepsy was an unclean and incurable wretch who might be possessed by the Devil. The political hostility between Islam and Christianity contributed to the continuation of the accusation of epilepsy throughout the Middle Ages. The Christian minister Archdeacon Humphrey Prideaux gave the following description of Muhammad's visions:\nwas sent from God of purpose to deliver them unto him. And whereas he was subject to the falling-sickness, whenever the fit was upon him, he pretended it to be a Trance, and that the Angel Gabriel comes from God with some Revelations unto him.\nSome modern Western scholars also have a skeptical view of Muhammad's seizures. Frank R. Freemon states Muhammad had \"conscious control over the course of the spells and can pretend to be in a religious trance.\" During the nineteenth century, as Islam was no longer a political or military threat to Western society, and perceptions of epilepsy changed, the theological and moral associations with epilepsy were removed; epilepsy was now viewed as a medical disorder. Nineteenth-century orientalist Margoliouth claimed that Muhammad suffered from epilepsy and even occasionally faked it for effect.\n\nSprenger attributes Muhammad's revelations to epileptic fits or a \"paroxysm of cataleptic insanity.\" In Schaff's view, Muhammad's \"early and frequent epileptic fits\" provided \"some light on his revelations.\" The most famous epileptic of the 19th century, Fyodor Dostoyevsky (1821–1881) wrote that epileptic attacks have an inspirational quality; he said they are “a supreme exaltation of emotional subjectivity” in which time stands still. Dostoyevsky claimed that his own attacks were similar to those of Muhammad: \"Probably it was of such an instant, that the epileptic Mahomet was speaking when he said that he had visited all the dwelling places of Allah within a shorter time than it took for his pitcher full of water to empty itself.\"\n\nIn an essay that discusses views of Muhammad's psychology, Franz Bul (1903) is said to have observed that \"hysterical natures find unusual difficulty and often complete inability to distinguish the false from the true\", and to have thought this to be \"the safest way to interpret the strange inconsistencies in the life of the Prophet.\" In the same essay Duncan Black Macdonald (1911) is credited with the opinion that \"fruitful investigation of the Prophet's life (should) proceed upon the assumption that he was fundamentally a pathological case.\"\n\nModern Western scholars of Islam have rejected the diagnosis of epilepsy. Tor Andrae rejects the idea that the inspired state is pathological attributing it to a scientifically superficial and hasty theory arguing that those who consider Muhammad epileptic should consider all types of semi-conscious and trance-like states, occasional loss of consciousness, and similar conditions as epileptic attacks. Andrae writes that \"[i]f epilepsy is to denote only those severe attacks which involve serious consequences for the physical and mental health, then the statement that Mohammad suffered from epilepsy must be emphatically rejected.\" Caesar Farah suggests that \"[t]hese insinuations resulted from the 19th-century infatuation with scientifically superficial theories of medical psychology.\" Noth, in the \"Encyclopedia of Islam\", states that such accusations were a typical feature of medieval European Christian polemic.\n\nMaxime Rodinson says that it is most probable that Muhammad's conditions was basically of the same kind as that found in many mystics rather than epilepsy. Fazlur Rahman refutes epileptic fits for the following reasons: Muhammad's condition begins with his career at the age of 40; according to the tradition seizures are \"invariably\" associated with the revelation and never occur by itself. Lastly, a sophisticated society like the Meccan or Medinese would have identified epilepsy clearly and definitely.\n\nWilliam Montgomery Watt also disagrees with the epilepsy diagnosis, saying that \"there are no real grounds for such a view.\" Elaborating, he says that \"epilepsy leads to physical and mental degeneration, and there are no signs of that in Muhammad.\" He then goes further and states that Muhammad was psychologically sound in general: \"he (Muhammad) was clearly in full possession of his faculties to the very end of his life.\" Watt concludes by stating \"It is incredible that a person subject to epilepsy, or hysteria, or even ungovernable fits of emotion, could have been the active leader of military expeditions, or the cool far-seeing guide of a city-state and a growing religious community; but all this we know Muhammad to have been.\"\n\nFrank R. Freemon (1976) thinks that the above reasons given by modern biographers of Muhammad in rejection of epilepsy come from the widespread misconceptions about the various types of epilepsy. In his differential diagnosis, Freemon rejects schizophrenic hallucinations, drug-induced mental changes such as might occur after eating plants containing hallucinogenic materials, transient ischemic attacks, hypoglycemia, labyrinthitis, Ménière's disease, or other inner ear maladies. At the end, Freemon argues that if one were forced to make a diagnosis psychomotor seizures of temporal lobe epilepsy would be the most tenable one, although our lack of scientific as well as historical knowledge makes unequivocal decision impossible. Freemon cites evidences supporting and opposing this diagnosis. In the end, Freemon points out that a medical diagnosis should not ignore Muhammad’s moral message because it is just as likely, perhaps more likely, for God communicate with a person in an abnormal state of mind.\n\nFrom a Muslim point of view, Freemon says, Muhammed's mental state at the time of revelation was unique and is not therefore amenable to medical or scientific discourse. In reaction to Freemon's article, GM. S. Megahed, a Muslim neurologist criticized the article arguing that there are no scientific explanations for many religious phenomena, and that if Muhammad's message is a result of psychomotor seizures, then on the same basis Moses' and Jesus' message would be the result of psychomotor seizures. In response, Freemon attributed such negative reactions to his article to the general misconceptions about epilepsy as a demeaning condition. Freemon said that he did plan to write an article on the inspirational spells of St. Paul, but the existence of such misconceptions caused him to cancel it.\n\nMuhammad has been criticized for several omissions during his prophethood: he left the Muslim community leaderless following his death by failing to declare the individual, selection process or institution that should succeed him, he failed to collect the Quran in a definitive text (later achieved during Uthman's Caliphate), and he failed to collect and codify his prophetic tradition, which work was later undertaken by scholars in the 8th and 9th centuries and became the second most important source of Islam's teachings.\n\nWilliam Muir, like many other 19th-century scholars divides Muhammad's life into two periods—Meccan and Medinan. He asserts that \"in the Meccan period of [Muhammad's] life there certainly can be traced no personal ends or unworthy motives,\" painting him as a man of good faith and a genuine reformer. However, that all changed after the \"Hijra\", according to Muir. \"There [in Medina] temporal power, aggrandisement, and self-gratification mingled rapidly with the grand object of the Prophet's life, and they were sought and attained by just the same instrumentality.\" From that point on, he accuses Muhammad of manufacturing \"messages from heaven\" in order to justify a lust for women and reprisals against enemies, among other sins.\n\nPhilip Schaff says that \"in the earlier part of his life he [Muhammad] was a sincere reformer and enthusiast, but after the establishment of his kingdom a slave of ambition for conquest\" and describes him as \"a slave of sensual passion.\" William St. Clair Tisdall also accused Muhammad of inventing revelations to justify his own desires.\n\nD.S. Margoliouth, another 19th-century scholar, sees Muhammad as a charlatan who beguiled his followers with techniques like those used by fraudulent mediums today. He has expressed a view that Muhammad faked his religious sincerity, playing the part of a messenger from God like a man in a play, adjusting his performances to create an illusion of spirituality. Margoliouth is especially critical of the character of Muhammad as revealed in Ibn Ishaq's famous biography, which he holds as especially telling because Muslims cannot dismiss it as the writings of an enemy:\n\nAccording to William Montgomery Watt and Richard Bell, recent writers have generally dismissed the idea that Muhammad deliberately deceived his followers, arguing that Muhammad “was absolutely sincere and acted in complete good faith”. Modern secular historians generally decline to address the question of whether the messages Muhammad reported being revealed to him were from \"his unconscious, the collective unconscious functioning in him, or from some divine source\", but they acknowledge that the material came from \"beyond his conscious mind.\" Watt says that sincerity does not directly imply correctness: In contemporary terms, Muhammad might have mistaken for divine revelation his own unconscious. William Montgomery Watt states:\n\nRudi Paret agrees, writing that \"Muhammad was not a deceiver,\" and Welch also holds that \"the really powerful factor in Muhammad’s life and the essential clue to his extraordinary success was his unshakable belief from beginning to end that he had been called by God. A conviction such as this, which, once firmly established, does not admit of the slightest doubt, exercises an incalculable influence on others. The certainty with which he came forward as the executor of God’s will gave his words and ordinances an authority that proved finally compelling.\"\n\nBernard Lewis, another modern historian, commenting on the common Western Medieval view of Muhammad as a self-seeking impostor, states that\n\nWatt rejects the idea that Muhammad's moral behavior deteriorated after he migrated to Medinia. He argues that \"it is based on too facile a use of the principle that all power corrupts and absolute power corrupts absolutely\". Watt interprets incidents in the Medinan period in such a way that they mark \"no failure in Muhammad to live to his ideals and no lapse from his moral principles.\"\n\n"}

He worked primarily with Radio Belize and is recognized as having brought that station to a position of prominence in the small Central American nation.\n\nColeman was born in Benque Viejo del Carmen to descendants of Honduran immigrants from Isla Roatan. Having attended primary school in Benque Viejo and high school in Belize City, he became involved in the nationalist movement on the labour front, working with George Price and the General Workers' Union in the 1950s. He had also gotten a part-time job with Radio Belize as a temporary announcer, at first working only in Spanish because the bosses thought he did not have the right accent for delivering an English-language newscast. \nHe received a certificate and a job as Labor Inspector but was fired a few months later after an altercation with a fellow employee. He fell back on his job at Radio Belize and within a decade had risen to become the voice of Belize, with a sometimes risque repartee of jokes and witticisms and a ready supply of listener approved music. About this time he married childhood sweetheart Carmen \"Panchita\" Aguallo; they had one son, current broadcaster with Positive Vibes FM Gerard Coleman. He also had a step granddaughter, Susan Hernandez, whom he loved very much like his own blood granddaughter. He often let her speak over the radio and pick songs for the playlist. Coleman also frequently performed at the former Bliss Institute, now Center for the Performing Arts. He died in 1994, at Radio Belize's ebb in Belize City, Belize, prior to the station's demise in 1998.\n\nColeman was termed a perfectionist by some of his coworkers. But he always kept them- and listeners- on edge with his own brand of humor, much of it focused on unseen companion \"Panchita\", which many listeners thought represented his wife, though this was not the case. Among several bad habits was his lack of judgement with regard to time, some mornings barely making it to studios in downtown Belize City; and his rampant alcoholism, which only after several scares was repudiated in the late 1970s. Coleman succeeded because he represented the resiliency of Belizeans in the face of the many disasters affecting the nation as it struggled toward independence.\n\n\n"}

She played Xenia Onatopp in \"GoldenEye\" (1995), Jean Grey / Phoenix in the \"X-Men\" film series (2000–2014), Ava Moore on \"Nip/Tuck\", and Lenore Mills in the \"Taken\" film trilogy (2008–2014). In 2008, she was appointed a Goodwill Ambassador for Integrity by the United Nations. She made her directorial debut with \"Bringing Up Bobby\" in 2011. She is also known for her role in the Netflix original series \"Hemlock Grove\" and for her role in ABC's \"How To Get Away With Murder\". Janssen starred in the 2017 NBC crime thriller \"\".\n\nFamke Beumer Janssen was born in Amstelveen in the Netherlands. She was given both her mother and father's surnames: Beumer and Janssen. She retained the name Janssen. She has two sisters, director Antoinette Beumer and actress Marjolein Beumer, both of whom changed their surnames to simply Beumer. In addition to her native Dutch, Janssen speaks English and French. She also learned German but has not kept up with it. Following her high school graduation, Janssen studied economics for a year at the University of Amsterdam, which she later called \"the stupidest idea I ever had.\" In the early 1990s, she enrolled at Columbia University to study creative writing and literature. She graduated in 1992 with a Bachelor of Arts degree.\n\nIn 1984, Janssen moved to the United States to begin her professional career as a fashion model. She signed with Elite Model Management and worked for Yves Saint Laurent, Giorgio Armani, Chanel, and Victoria's Secret. She starred in a 1988 commercial for the perfume Exclamation by Coty, Inc. Her looks have been compared to Hedy Lamarr and other 1940s films stars.\n\nAfter retiring from modelling in the early 1990s, Janssen had guest roles on several television series, including a starring role in the 1992 \"\" episode \"The Perfect Mate\", as empathic metamorph Kamala, opposite Patrick Stewart, with whom she later starred in the \"X-Men\" film series. That same year, Janssen was offered the role of Jadzia Dax in \"\" but turned it down to pursue film roles. Her first film role was alongside Jeff Goldblum in the 1992 crime drama film \"Fathers & Sons\".\n\nIn 1995, Janssen appeared in Pierce Brosnan's first James Bond film, \"GoldenEye\", as femme fatale Xenia Onatopp. She also appeared in \"Lord of Illusions\" with Scott Bakula. In an attempt to fight against typecasting after her Bond girl performance, Janssen began seeking out more intriguing support roles, appearing in John Irvin's \"City of Industry\", Woody Allen's \"Celebrity\", Robert Altman's \"The Gingerbread Man\", and Ted Demme's \"Monument Ave.\" Denis Leary, her co-star in \"Monument Ave.\", was impressed by how easily she blended in, initially not recognizing her as she was already in character. In the late 1990s, she also appeared in \"The Faculty\", \"Rounders\", \"Deep Rising\", and \"House on Haunted Hill\".\n\nIn 2000, Janssen played superhero Dr. Jean Grey in the Marvel Studios film \"X-Men\". She later reprised the role in the 2003 sequel, \"X2\" where her character shows signs of increasing powers but at the end of the film, she is presumably killed. Janssen returns as a very much alive Jean whose death in \"X2\" awoke her dark alternate personality, Phoenix in \"\" (2006). At the end of the film, she is killed by Wolverine (played by Hugh Jackman), who only does it because Jean asks him to, not wanting to hurt anyone when Phoenix is in control. For that role, she won a Saturn Award for Best Supporting Actress. She returned as Jean in the 2013 film \"The Wolverine\" as a hallucination of Wolverine's.\n\nIn 2014, Janssen reprised her role of Jean Grey in a brief cameo for \"\", as did a few of the original actors from the first three films including Halle Berry, Kelsey Grammer, Anna Paquin and James Marsden. In the film, Wolverine went back in time and changed the course of the future, the result being that the events of the third movie, including the deaths of Jean Grey and Cyclops, never happened.\n\nIn 2002, Janssen landed the role of villainess Serleena in \"Men in Black II\", but had to abandon the film due to a death in her family and was replaced by Lara Flynn Boyle.\n\nIn addition, Janssen had a prominent role in the second season of the popular TV series \"Nip/Tuck\", as the seductive and manipulative life coach Ava Moore, which earned her Hollywood Life's Breakthrough Artist of the Year Award. She reprised her role in the final two episodes of the series.\n\nIn 2007, she starred in \"Turn the River\", for which she was awarded the Special Recognition Best Actress Award at the Hamptons International Film Festival. The following year, she starred in Luc Besson's \"Taken\". Janssen also continued to work in television, appearing in TV pilots for NBC's cop drama \"Winters\" and Showtime's \"The Farm\", a spinoff of \"The L Word\" set in a women's prison. Both pilots were rejected by their respective networks. Janssen also provided the Dutch language narration for the Studio Tram Tour at all Disney theme parks.\n\nIn 2011, Janssen made her directorial début with the drama \"Bringing Up Bobby\". She also wrote the screenplay to the film, which stars Milla Jovovich, Bill Pullman and Marcia Cross. She reprised her role as Lenore Mills in \"Taken 2\" (2012) and \"Taken 3\" (2014). She starred as the main villain Muriel in \"\" (2013).\n\nJanssen has starred in the Netflix original horror thriller television series \"Hemlock Grove\" since 2013 where she plays the role of family matriarch Olivia Godfrey.\n\nJanssen was cast in a starring role in the NBC crime thriller, \"\", a spinoff of the NBC series \"The Blacklist\", in March 2016; it was picked up to series in May 2016.\n\nJanssen was married to writer and director Kip Williams, son of architect Tod Williams, from 1995 to 2000.\n\nJanssen appeared with her dog, Licorice, a brindle Boston Terrier, in a 2007 PETA campaign to raise awareness for animal rights. The campaign used the slogan \"Be an Angel for Animals.\" On 28 January 2008, she was appointed a Goodwill Ambassador for Integrity for the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime at a United Nations anti-corruption conference held in Nusa Dua, Bali.\n\nIn 2016, Janssen showed frustration in not being cast in the new \"X-Men\" movie \"\" saying Hollywood was sexist towards older women. She said “Women, it’s interesting because they’re replaced, and the older versions are never to be seen again... whereas the men are allowed to be both ages.”\n\n"}

He played a key role in the 1986 EDSA Revolution that toppled President Ferdinand Marcos.\n\nAfter 1986, he led a series of unsuccessful but violent coup attempts against the administration of Corazon Aquino. President Fidel Ramos granted him amnesty in 1992. He entered politics and became a senator from 1995 to 2004 and again since 2007. He ran for vice president of the Philippines, being Jejomar Binay's running-mate in 2016, but were defeated by Leni Robredo and Rodrigo Duterte respectively.\n\nGregorio Honasan was born in Baguio City to Colonel Romeo Gillego Honasan and Alicia \"Alice\" Masip Ballesteros, both from Sorsogon province. Honasan spent his elementary days at San Beda College from Kindergarten to Grade 6. After which, he went to Taiwan and studied at the Dominican School, Taipei, Taiwan. He then returned to the Philippines and finished his high school at Don Bosco Technical College. He attained his Bachelor of Science degree at the Philippine Military Academy, where he received the title of \"Class Baron\", the academy's highest leadership award.\n\nAfter graduating in 1971, he joined the Philippine Army's special forces, Scout Ranger Regiment and went into combat against separatist and communist insurgents in Luzon and Mindanao. He was wounded in action at battles in Lebak and Jolo. Making his way up through the armed forces, he became aide-de-camp to Defense Minister Juan Ponce Enrile in 1974, and later became the Defense Ministry's Chief of Security.\n\nConcurrent with his position as security chief, he was a board member of the Northern Mindanao Development Bank and president of the Beatriz Marketing Company.\n\nIn 1986, Honasan and a cabal of colonels, backed by Enrile, tried to use popular unrest to overthrow the dictatorship of President Ferdinand Marcos. When the plot was uncovered, the conspirators sought refuge in the military headquarters and called on civilians, the media, and the Catholic Church for protection. Hundreds of thousands of people served as human shields to protect Honasan and his men from Marcos' forces, sparking the 1986 People Power Revolution that led to Marcos' fall from power and the installation of Corazon Aquino as president.\n\nAquino awarded Honasan a Distinguished Conduct Star for the EDSA Revolution and the Presidential Government Medal in 1986. Under the new government, he was head of a special group in the defense ministry. Using his position, he was covertly involved in various coup attempts against Aquino. On August 28, 1987, fighting broke out in the streets and Honasan ordered his men to attack government installations, resulting in the deaths of dozens, including many civilians. The attack was put down by government forces, but Honasan was able to escape. He was later captured and imprisoned on a Navy ship in Manila Bay. He later escaped once again by convincing his guards to join his cause.\n\nPhilippine President Fidel Ramos, who was elected in 1992, granted amnesty to his comrade Honasan. Honasan utilized his rebel infamy to enter politics in 1995, becoming the first independent candidate in Philippine history to win a seat in the Senate. He was re-elected in 2001, filled the vacant seat left by Senator Teofisto Guingona Jr., who was appointed by President Gloria Macapagal Arroyo as Vice President. From April 30 to May 1, 2001, together with Juan Ponce Enrile, Miriam Defensor Santiago, Panfilo Lacson and Vicente Sotto III, he led the EDSA III protests in support of Joseph Estrada. On May 1, 2001, the protesters stormed Malacañang Palace.\n\nHe left the Senate when the term expired in 2004. In the general election held in May 2007, he was again elected to the Senate. Running as an independent candidate, he polled some 11.6 million votes, finishing 10th out of 37 candidates for 12 Senate vacancies. He took up his post on June 30. He was reelected during the 2013 elections, placing twelfth, his fourth consecutive term.\n\nOn June 2015, Justice Undersecretary Justiniano amended the complaint against Senator Honasan for his alleged part in the Pork Barrel Scam involving allegations of corrupt malversation of public funds.\n\nFollowing the alleged collapse of talks between UNA presidential candidate Jejomar Binay Honasan became Binay's running mate.\n\n"}

He is known as host of the NBC game show \"Deal or No Deal\", as well as the show's daytime and Canadian-English counterparts. In 1987, Mandel starred alongside Amy Steel in the comedy film \"Walk Like a Man\". Before his career as a game show host, Mandel was best known for his role as rowdy ER intern Dr. Wayne Fiscus on the NBC medical drama \"St. Elsewhere\". He is also well known for being the creator and star of the children's cartoon \"Bobby's World\", as well as a judge on NBC's \"America's Got Talent\".\n\nMandel was born and lived in the Willowdale area of Toronto, Ontario. He is Jewish, and his ancestors emigrated from Romania and Poland. Mandel is also a distant cousin to violinist Itzhak Perlman. His father was a lighting manufacturer and a real estate agent. Mandel was expelled from his high school (William Lyon Mackenzie Collegiate Institute) for impersonating a school official and hiring a construction company to build an addition to his school. Afterwards, Mandel worked as a carpet salesman. He was a stand-up comedian at Yuk Yuk's in Toronto and by September 1978 had a week-long booking as featured act, billed as \"a wild and crazy borderline psychotic\". His repertoire included placing a latex glove over his head and inflating it by blowing through his nose, the fingers of the glove extending above his head like a cockscomb. When the audience reacted uproariously to that and similar antics, his trademark response was to extend his arms palms up, look incredulous, and say, \"it's you.\" His manager during the Yuk Yuk years was Canadian David Holiff who Mandel later fired. \n\nOn a trip to Los Angeles, Mandel performed a set at The Comedy Store, which resulted in his becoming a regular performer there. A producer for the comedic game show \"Make Me Laugh\" saw him and booked Mandel for several appearances during the show's run in 1979. He was booked to open for David Letterman at shows in the summer of 1979. CBC-TV's head of variety programming saw his performance in October 1979 and immediately signed him for a TV special. In 1980, he won the lead role in the Canadian movie \"Gas\", co-starring Susan Anspach and Donald Sutherland. Mandel was one of the first \"VeeJays\" to appear on Nickelodeon's music video series, \"Pop Clips\".\n\nMandel came to national attention in the US during a six-year run on \"St. Elsewhere\", starting in 1982 and playing the role of Dr. Wayne Fiscus, opposite the late Ed Flanders, and Norman Lloyd, with whom he remains good friends as of 2015. While working as Dr. Fiscus, and continuing to work as a comedian, he also did movies, including his role as the voice of Gizmo in the 1984 hit \"Gremlins\" and its 1990 sequel \"\". In 1985, Mandel made a cameo in the Michael J. Fox directed short \"The Iceman Hummeth\" which was subsequently broadcast on \"Late Night with David Letterman\" in November 1985. In 1986, he starred in \"A Fine Mess\" alongside Ted Danson. He performed his stand-up comedy act in several cities (the \"Watusi Tour\"), which was followed by his \"Watusi\" music video in 1987. For the first two seasons of \"Muppet Babies\", he voiced Bunsen Honeydew, Animal, and Skeeter. He starred alongside Amy Steel in the 1987 comedy film \"Walk Like a Man\". He was also \"Maurice\" in the 1989 movie \"Little Monsters\". In 1990, he starred in the short-lived sitcom \"Good Grief\" on Fox. He was also the creator and executive producer of the Emmy-nominated children's animated series \"Bobby's World\" (1990–1998), to which he supplied the voices of the title character and his father (using Howie's \"normal\" voice for Bobby's dad). \"Bobby's World\" ran for eight seasons on Fox and was later syndicated. \n\n1992 saw the weekly airing of his self-titled comedy show \"Howie\" with multiple guest stars such as Gilbert Gottfried, Little Richard, and Lita Ford as the in-house band guitarist. His character Bobby made a regular appearance on the show. In 1994, Mandel voiced the lead character, Little Howie, of the video game \"Tuneland\". He starred in the sketch comedy series \"Howie Mandel's Sunny Skies\" in 1995 on Showtime. Mandel appeared in the 1995 Clint Black country music video \"Summer's Comin'\". He played the lead role of the professor in the short-lived TV series \"The Amazing Live Sea Monkeys\", and guest-starred on a 1996 episode of the ABC TV series \"\" as DC Comics supervillain Mister Mxyzptlk. In 1998, he hosted his own syndicated talk show, \"The Howie Mandel Show\", which was cancelled after one season. In 1999/2000, Mandel played \"Jason\" in the film \"\", was the voice of Jack in the movie The Tangerine Bear in 2000, and in 2002 played the Sand Man in the movie \"Hansel and Gretel\". In 2006, he appeared as himself as a guest host in a parody of \"Deal or No Deal\" in the show-within-a-show of the TV series \"Studio 60 on the Sunset Strip\". In 2007, he guest-starred as himself in an episode of NBC's \"Medium\", making a dream cameo of himself on \"Deal or No Deal.\" In that episode, he booted off the nighttime drama's protagonist for \"cheating\", since in the show he is a psychic medium and appeared to \"know\" the contents of the cases. Mandel plays his alter-ego, Phil Skorjanc, in most of his comedy shows and these are a fan favorite. Bobby also made a cameo appearance in a February 2007 episode of \"Deal or No Deal\". On a special 2-hour Christmas episode, first aired on December 25, 2007, Mandel delivered one line with Bobby's voice, as per request of the contestant.\n\nMandel's signature stunt as a stand-up comedian (besides his Bobby alter-ego) was stretching a latex glove over his head and inflating it with his nostrils, filling it until it suddenly propelled itself off his head. This trick also lent itself to the title and cover photo of his comedy album, \"Fits Like a Glove\" (1986). He eventually gave up the routine under doctor's orders after being diagnosed with a perforated sinus. However, in a cameo role as himself on \"My Name is Earl\", he did the routine. He guest starred in two episodes of \"Monk\" (\"Mr. Monk Joins a Cult\" and \"Mr. Monk's 100th Case\").\n\nMandel is known for his frequent appearances as a comedian and for his hidden camera segments on \"The Tonight Show with Jay Leno\". He has appeared in many television commercials for Boston Pizza as their hired spokesperson. In April 2004, he was selected as number 82 on Comedy Central's list of the 100 greatest stand up comedians of all time. In October 2005, he was named to be the host of the US version of \"Deal or No Deal\", which debuted on December 19, 2005, on NBC and became a popular program in early 2006. Mandel also hosts \"Deal or No Deal Canada\"; originating from Toronto, \"Deal or No Deal Canada\" debuted in January 2007 on Global, which made him one of the few game show hosts (\"Weakest Link'\"s Anne Robinson, The Chairs John McEnroe, Pyramids Donny Osmond, The Singing Bees Joey Fatone, and Minute to Win Its Darren McMullen being others) to host both a domestic and an international version of the same game show. Mandel joins Alex Trebek, Jim Perry, and Geoff Edwards on the list of game show hosts who emceed one game show simultaneously in Canada and the United States.\n\nIn 2007, Mandel made an appearance in an episode of \"Sesame Street\"’s 38th season. That same year, he was parodied on the show as Howie Eatswell, the Muppet host of \"Sesame\"s game show segment \"Meal or No Meal\". Mandel has hosted the DVD game version of \"Deal or No Deal\", \"Fact or Crap Beat Da Bomb\" and \"Would You Rather\" for Imagination Games.\n\nMandel had a cameo appearance as himself on the NBC show \"My Name is Earl\", in the episode Earl's roommates robbed an Indian casino at which Mandel was performing. While stealing money, they also kidnapped Mandel. In the episode, Mandel performed his old routine of inflating a rubber glove over his head with his nostrils.\n\nMandel is a notable alumnus of Beth David B'nai Israel Beth Am's Hebrew School located in Toronto, as well as three other Toronto high schools. Mandel is currently performing a variety/comedy act at the MGM Grand Hotel-Casino in Las Vegas, Nevada.\n\nStarting in 2007, Mandel became a spokesperson for Internet retailer buy.com. He is sometimes featured in a section called \"What's Shakin'?\" with Mandel. On September 8, 2008, Mandel began hosting a five-day-a-week syndicated daytime version of \"Deal or No Deal\", with a top prize of $500,000. On January 9, 2009, Mandel's reality show \"Howie Do It\" premiered on NBC.\n\nOn March 31, 2011, Mandel premiered a flash-mob show on Fox called \"Mobbed\". Originally a presentation pilot, the ratings after \"American Idol\" prompted Fox to pick up the show for eight to ten episodes.\n\nOn November 30, 2012, he hosted the NASCAR Sprint Cup Awards Ceremony. On December 10, 2012, his six-night special game show, \"Take It All\", premiered.\n\nHe appeared in one episode of the animated series \"Fugget About It\" as the voice of FBI Agent Rick Chickmagnet in 2013. Since 2013, Mandel has executive-produced the TBS hidden-camera show \"Deal with It\". He also regularly makes appearances and co-hosts the show along with main host Theo Von.\n\nIn 2003, while Mandel was deciding whether or not to quit show business, the executive producers at NBC asked him to host the show, but he declined many times. They then mailed him a tape of the overseas version and he finally accepted. In 2007, he hosted a five-episode run of the Canadian-English version. The show then went to daytime with Mandel remaining as host, although Arsenio Hall was originally intended to host the show. In a January 2009 interview on \"Anytime with Bob Kushell\", Mandel expressed mild, jovial frustration over how some of his contestants hold out during the game show, despite the fact that the grand prize is many times what they would make in a year.\n\nOn March 12, 2018, it was announced that Mandel will host the 2018 CNBC revival of the game show, and also become an executive producer. The show will premiere on December 5, 2018.\n\nIn January 2010, it was announced that Mandel would replace David Hasselhoff as one of the judges on NBC's \"America's Got Talent\" after Hasselhoff announced that he was leaving to work on a new television series. Out of all judges on the show, Mandel currently has the longest tenure than any other judge or host, nine consecutive seasons.\n\nMandel has been married to Terry (Soil) Mandel for nearly 40 years. Together they have three children: daughters Jackie and Riley, and son Alex.\n\nOn September 4, 2008, Mandel received a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame, and Comedy Central list him as #82 on their list of the 100 greatest stand-up comedians of all time.\n\nMandel received a star on Canada's Walk of Fame in Toronto. The induction ceremony was held on September 12, 2009. He is the third game show host to be inducted (the first being Monty Hall in 2002 and the second being Alex Trebek in 2006).\n\nIn October 2008, Mandel revealed that he has attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) on the morning talk show \"Live with Regis and Kelly\", adding that he is currently working to raise adult ADHD awareness among the general public. On January 12, 2009, Mandel was reportedly sent to St. Michael's Hospital in Toronto suffering from chest pains and what was reported as a minor heart attack. According to various news reports, he was experiencing an irregular heartbeat, but the reports were later revealed as inaccurate. He was later discharged. Mandel has written and published an in-depth autobiography which details his life with OCD, ADHD, and comedy called \"\".\n\nMandel is a fan of the Toronto Maple Leafs hockey team.\n\nMandel is colorblind.\n\nMandel has spoken publicly about having obsessive compulsive disorder, which can take many forms, including mysophobia. Mandel's anxiety affects him to the point that he does not shake hands with anyone, including enthusiastic contestants on \"Deal or No Deal\", unless he is wearing latex gloves. Instead of shaking contestants' hands when they offer them, Mandel often opts to exchange fist bumps, put his hands on contestants' shoulders, or give an occasional hug. He once kissed a female contestant on the show for good luck despite his disorder. He now takes medicine to control his condition and even pokes fun at himself for it. He revealed on \"The Howard Stern Show\" on March 24, 2006, that his shaved head is not related to natural hair loss, but to OCD. He stated that the lack of hair makes him feel cleaner. In the back yard of Mandel's house is a second, smaller house which he had built especially to live in solitude when a family member is sick. During his appearance on \"Mad TV\", Mandel and cast member Bobby Lee made fun of the former's condition. Mandel also confronted his germophobia in Season 4, Episode 1 of the Comedy Central series \"This Is Not Happening\". The show aired on February 3, 2018. \n\nWhile guest-hosting on \"Live with Regis and Kelly\" in 2005, Mandel had an altercation in which his hand was seized by guest Rob Schneider; who condescendingly teased Mandel, stating he needed to 'get over' his phobia. Host Kelly Ripa admonished Schneider on-air, while also obtaining hand sanitizer for Mandel from an audience member. \n\nIn September 2007, Mandel interviewed former NFL running back Marshall Faulk on NFL Network. Faulk asked him to shake hands, but Mandel refused, noting he would rather have the fist tap, as he does with \"Deal or No Deal\" contestants. Seconds later, Faulk subjected him to a \"sneak attack\", and shook his right hand. Mandel screamed and walked away from Faulk. He then washed his hands several times. On a guest appearance on \"Free Radio\", Mandel explained that not only is he afraid of public bathrooms, but is unable to use any bathroom other than his own.\n\nDuring the season 5 episode of \"America's Got Talent\" in Chicago, Zach Carty attempted an act involving sneezing. Mandel pressed his X button at the beginning of the act, and ran into an aisle until the act was over. (Carty was unable to perform the act.) Mandel kept yelling at the other judges, Piers Morgan and Sharon Osbourne, to press their X buttons and for the audience to turn in his direction. Morgan eventually pressed the X button, but Osbourne refused, so Mandel promptly ran over and pressed her button, ending the act. In a backstage interview, he expressed to the television audience that he receives therapy to help him cope. In another \"America's Got Talent\" season 5 incident, Dan Sperry, a contestant on the YouTube quarterfinal episode, dropped some dental floss that he had run through his neck as part of a magic act. He dropped the floss in Mandel's vicinity, prompting him to get up and run to the other side of the judges' table. Just before Sperry's next performance in the semifinals, Mandel admitted that it was \"the most horrified\" he'd been on the show and that his therapist \"loves [Dan Sperry]\", because there had been two extra sessions that week. During the premiere of season 6, juggler Frank Oliver grabbed Mandel's head to balance himself during a unicycle act. Despite receiving a buzzer from Mandel, Oliver moved on to the next round. Mandel refused to give Oliver any feedback during the judge's voting process.\n\nDuring \"AGT\"'s 10th season, a contestant named Chris Jones directly utilized Mandel's mysophobia (fear of germs) as the subject of his hypnotism act. Under the post-hypnotic suggestion that Jones and the other judges were wearing latex gloves, Mandel shook the bare hands of all involved, which elicited shouts of amazement and drew much attention on the Internet. After viewing the video of the act, Mandel said that he was \"upset about it\" and \"somewhat betrayed\" by the act but that his therapist subsequently said it was a good thing. Chris Jones progressed to the Judge's Cuts where he was eliminated from the competition.\n\nMandel commented in 2011 that he has struggled with the condition since childhood, but did not seek help until he was an adult:\n\n"}

He is best known for his research in climatology, his 1988 Congressional testimony on climate change that helped raise broad awareness of global warming, and his advocacy of action to avoid dangerous climate change. In recent years he has become a climate activist to mitigate the effects of climate change, on a few occasions leading to his arrest.\n\nHansen was born in Denison, Iowa, to James Ivan Hansen and Gladys Ray Hansen. He was trained in physics and astronomy in the space science program of James Van Allen at the University of Iowa. He obtained a B.A. in Physics and Mathematics with highest distinction in 1963, an M.S. in Astronomy in 1965 and a Ph.D. in Physics in 1967, all three degrees from the University of Iowa. He participated in the NASA graduate traineeship from 1962 to 1966 and, at the same time, between 1965 and 1966, he was a visiting student at the Institute of Astrophysics at the University of Kyoto and in the Department of Astronomy at the University of Tokyo. He then began work at the Goddard Institute for Space Studies in 1967.\n\nAfter graduate school, Hansen continued his work with radiative transfer models, attempting to understand the Venusian atmosphere. He later applied and refined these models to understand the Earth's atmosphere, and in particular, the effects that aerosols and trace gases have on Earth's climate. His development and use of global climate models has contributed to the further understanding of the Earth's climate. In 2009 his first book, \"Storms of My Grandchildren\", was published. In 2012 he presented the TED Talk \"Why I must speak out about climate change\".\n\nFrom 1981 to 2013, he was the director of the NASA Goddard Institute for Space Studies in New York City, a part of the Goddard Space Flight Center.\n\n, Hansen directs the Program on Climate Science, Awareness and Solutions at Columbia University's Earth Institute. The program is working to continue to \"connect the dots\" from advancing basic climate science to promoting public awareness to advocating policy actions.\n\nHansen is representing his granddaughter as well as \"future generations\" as plaintiffs in the \"Juliana v. United States\" lawsuit, which is suing the United States government and some of its executive branch's positions for not protecting a stable climate system.\n\nAs a college student at the University of Iowa, Hansen was attracted to science and the research done by James Van Allen's space science program in the physics and astronomy department. A decade later, his focus shifted to planetary research that involved trying to understand the climate change on earth that will result from anthropogenic changes of the atmospheric composition.\n\nHansen has stated that one of his research interests is radiative transfer in planetary atmospheres, especially the interpretation of remote sensing of the Earth's atmosphere and surface from satellites. Because of the ability of satellites to monitor the entire globe, they may be one of the most effective ways to monitor and study global change. His other interests include the development of global circulation models to help understand the observed climate trends, and diagnosing human impacts on climate.\n\nIn the late 1960s and early 1970s, following his Ph.D. dissertation, Hansen published several papers on the planet Venus. Venus has a high brightness temperature in the radio frequencies compared to the infrared. He proposed that the hot surface was the result of aerosols trapping the internal energy of the planet. More recent studies have suggested that several billion years ago, Venus's atmosphere was much more like Earth's than it is now and that there were probably substantial quantities of liquid water on the surface, but a runaway greenhouse effect was caused by the evaporation of that original water, which generated a critical level of greenhouse gases in its atmosphere.\n\nHansen continued his study of Venus by looking at the composition of its clouds. He looked at the near-infrared reflectivity of ice clouds, compared them to observations of Venus, and found that they qualitatively agreed. He also was able to use a radiative transfer model to establish an upper limit to the size of the ice particles if the clouds were actually made of ice. Evidence published in the early 1980s showed that the clouds consist mainly of sulfur dioxide and sulfuric acid droplets.\n\nBy 1974, the composition of Venus' clouds had not yet been determined, with many scientists proposing a wide variety of compounds, including liquid water and aqueous solutions of ferrous chloride. Hansen and Hovenier used the polarization of sunlight reflected from the planet to establish that the clouds were spherical and had a refractive index and cloud drop effective radius which eliminated all of the proposed cloud types except sulfuric acid. Kiyoshi Kawabata and Hansen expanded upon this work by looking at the variation of polarization on Venus. They found that the visible clouds are a diffuse haze rather than a thick cloud, confirming the same results obtained from transits across the sun.\n\nThe Pioneer Venus project was launched in May 1978 and reached Venus late that same year. Hansen collaborated with Larry Travis and other colleagues in a 1979 \"Science\" article that reported on the development and variability of clouds in the ultraviolet spectrum. They conclude that there are at least three different cloud materials that contribute to the images: a thin haze layer, sulfuric acid clouds and an unknown ultraviolet absorber below the sulfuric acid cloud layer. The linear polarization data obtained from the same mission confirmed that the low- and mid-level clouds were sulfuric acid with radius of about 1 micrometer. Above the cloud layer was a layer of submicrometre haze.\n\nThe first GISS (NASA Goddard Institute for Space Studies) global temperature analysis was published in 1981. Hansen and his co-author analyzed the surface air temperature at meteorological stations focusing on the years from 1880 to 1985. Temperatures for stations closer together than 1000 kilometers were shown to be highly correlated, especially in the mid-latitudes, providing a way to combine the station data to provide accurate long-term variations. They conclude that global mean temperatures can be determined even though meteorological stations are typically in the Northern hemisphere and confined to continental regions. Warming in the past century was found to be , with warming similar in both hemispheres. When the analysis was updated in 1988, the four warmest years on record were all in the 1980s. The two warmest years were 1981 and 1987. During a senate meeting on June 23, 1988, Hansen reported that he was ninety-nine percent certain the earth was warmer then than it had ever been measured to be, there was a clear cause and effect relationship with the greenhouse effect and lastly that due to global warming, the likelihood of freak weather was steadily increasing.\n\nWith the 1991 eruption of Mount Pinatubo, 1992 saw a cooling in the global temperatures. There was speculation that this would cause the next couple years to be cooler because of the large serial correlation in the global temperatures. Bassett and Lin found the statistical odds of a new temperature record to be small. Hansen countered by saying that having insider information shifts the odds to those who know the physics of the climate system, and that whether there is a new temperature record depends upon the particular data set used.\n\nThe temperature data was updated in 1999 to report that 1998 was the warmest year since the instrumental data began in 1880. They also found that the rate of temperature change was larger than at any time in instrument history, and conclude that the recent El Niño was not totally responsible for the large temperature anomaly in 1998. In spite of this, the United States had seen a smaller degree of warming, and a region in the eastern U.S. and the western Atlantic Ocean had actually cooled slightly.\n\n2001 saw a major update to how the temperature was calculated. It incorporated corrections due to the following reasons: time-of-observation bias; station history changes; classification of rural/urban station; the urban adjustment based on satellite measurements of night light intensity, and relying more on rural station than urban. Evidence was found of local urban warming in urban, suburban and small-town records.\n\nThe anomalously high global temperature in 1998 due to El Niño resulted in a brief drop in subsequent years. However, a 2001 Hansen report in the journal \"Science\" states that global warming continues, and that the increasing temperatures should stimulate discussions on how to slow global warming. The temperature data was updated in 2006 to report that temperatures are now warmer than a century ago, and conclude that the recent global warming is a real climate change and not an artifact from the urban heat island effect. The regional variation of warming, with more warming in the higher latitudes, is further evidence of warming that is anthropogenic in origin.\n\nIn 2007, Stephen McIntyre notified GISS that many of the U.S. temperature records from the Historical Climatology Network (USHCN) displayed a discontinuity around the year 2000. NASA corrected the computer code used to process the data and credited McIntyre with pointing out the flaw. Hansen indicated that he felt that several news organizations had overreacted to this mistake. In 2010, Hansen published a paper entitled \"Global Surface Temperature Change\" describing current global temperature analysis.\n\nHansen has also contributed toward the understanding of black carbon on regional climate. In recent decades, northern China has experienced increased drought, and southern China has received increased summer rain resulting in a larger number of floods. Southern China has had a decrease in temperatures while most of the world has warmed. In a paper with Menon and colleagues, through the use of observations and climate models results, they conclude that the black carbon heats the air, increases convection and precipitation, and leads to larger surface cooling than if the aerosols were sulfates.\n\nA year later, Hansen teamed with Makiko Sato to publish a study on black carbon using the global network of AERONET sun photometers. While the location of the AERONET instruments did not represent a global sample, they could still be used to validate global aerosol climatologies. They found that most aerosol climatologies underestimated the amount of black carbon by a factor of at least 2. This corresponds to an increase in the climate forcing of around , which they hypothesize is partially offset by the cooling of non-absorbing aerosols.\n\nEstimations of trends in black carbon emissions show that there was a rapid increase in the 1880s after the start of the Industrial Revolution, and a leveling off from 1900–1950 as environmental laws were enacted. China and India have recently increased their emissions of black carbon corresponding to their rapid development. The emissions from the United Kingdom were estimated using a network of stations that measured black smoke and sulfur dioxide. They report that atmospheric black carbon concentrations have been decreasing since the beginning of the record in the 1960s, and that the decline was faster than the decline in black-carbon-producing fuel use.\n\nA 2007 paper used the GISS climate model in an attempt to determine the origin of black carbon in the arctic. Much of the arctic aerosol comes from south Asia. Countries such as the United States and Russia have a lower contribution than previously assumed.\n\nThe United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change is an international environmental treaty that has the objective of stabilizing greenhouse gas concentrations in the atmosphere at a level that would prevent dangerous anthropogenic interference with the climate system.\n\nIn 2000, Hansen advanced an alternative view of global warming over the last 100 years, arguing that during that time frame the negative forcing via aerosols and the positive forcing via carbon dioxide () largely balanced each other out, and that the 0.74±0.18 °C net rise in average global temperatures could mostly be explained by greenhouse gases other than carbon dioxide, such as methane and chlorofluorocarbons. However, even then he wrote \"the future balance of forcings is likely to shift toward dominance of CO over aerosols\".\n\nIn 2003, Hansen wrote a paper called \"Can We Defuse the Global Warming Time Bomb?\" in which he argued that human-caused forces on the climate are now greater than natural ones, and that this, over a long time period, can cause large climate changes. He further states that a lower limit on \"dangerous anthropogenic interference\" is set by the stability of the Greenland and Antarctic ice sheets. His view on actions to mitigate climate change is that \"halting global warming requires urgent, unprecedented international cooperation, but the needed actions are feasible and have additional benefits for human health, agriculture and the environment.\"\n\nIn a 2004 presentation at the University of Iowa, Hansen announced that he was told by high-ranking government officials not to talk about how anthropogenic influence could have a dangerous effect on climate because it's not understood what 'dangerous' means, or how humans are actually affecting climate. He describes this as a Faustian bargain because atmospheric aerosols have health risks, and should be reduced, but doing so will effectively increase the warming effects from .\n\nHansen and coauthors propose that the global mean temperature is a good tool to diagnose dangerous anthropogenic interference with the climate system. Two elements are particularly important when discussing dangerous anthropogenic interference: sea level rise and the extinction of species. They describe a business-as-usual scenario, which has greenhouse gases growing at approximately 2% per year; and an alternate scenario, in which greenhouse gases concentrations decline. Under the alternate scenario, sea levels could rise by 1 meter per century, causing problems due to the dense population in coastal areas. But this would be minor compared to the 10-meter increase in sea level under the business-as-usual scenario. Hansen describes the situation with species extinction similarly to that of sea level rise. Assuming the alternate scenario, the situation is not good, but it is much worse for business as usual.\n\nThe concept of dangerous anthropogenic interference was clarified in a 2007 paper, finding that further warming of 1 °C would be highly disruptive to humans. An alternate scenario would keep the warming to below this if climate sensitivity were below 3 °C for doubled . The conclusion is that levels above 450 ppm are considered dangerous, but that reduction in non- greenhouse gases can provide temporary relief from drastic cuts. Further findings are that arctic climate change has been forced by non- constituents as much as by . The 2007 paper cautions that prompt action is needed to slow growth and to prevent a dangerous anthropogenic interference.\n\nVilhelm Bjerknes began the modern development of the general circulation model in the early 20th century. The progress of numerical modeling was slow due to the slow speed of early computers and the lack of adequate observations. It wasn't until the 1950s that the numerical models were getting close to being realistic. Hansen's first contribution to numerical climate models came with the 1974 publication of the GISS model. He and his colleagues claimed that the model was successful in simulating the major features of sea-level pressure and 500mb heights in the North American region.\n\nA 1981 \"Science\" publication by Hansen and a team of scientists at Goddard concluded that carbon dioxide in the atmosphere would lead to warming sooner than previously predicted. They used a one-dimensional radiative-convective model that calculates temperature as a function of height. They reported that the results from the 1D model are similar to those of the more complex 3D models, and can simulate basic mechanisms and feedbacks. Hansen predicted that temperatures would rise out of the climate noise by the 1990s, much earlier than predicted by other researches. He also predicted that it would be difficult to convince politicians and the public to react.\n\nBy the early 1980s, the computational speed of computers, along with refinements in climate models, allowed longer experiments. The models now included physics beyond the previous equations, such as convection schemes, diurnal changes, and snow-depth calculations. The advances in computational efficiency, combined with the added physics, meant the GISS model could be run for five years. It was shown that global climate can be simulated reasonably well with a grid-point resolution as coarse as 1000 kilometers.\n\nThe first climate prediction computed from a general circulation model that was published by Hansen was in 1988, the same year as his well-known Senate testimony. The second generation of the GISS model was used to estimate the change in mean surface temperature based on a variety of scenarios of future greenhouse gas emissions. Hansen concluded that global warming would be evident within the next few decades, and that it would result in temperatures at least as high as during the Eemian. He argued that, if the temperature rises above the 1950–1980 mean for a few years, it is the \"smoking gun\" pointing to human-caused global warming.\nIn 2006, Hansen and colleagues compared the observations with the projections made by Hansen in his 1988 testimony before the United States Congress. They described the intermediate scenario as the most likely, and that real-world greenhouse gas forcing has been closest to this scenario. It contained the effects of three volcanic eruptions in the fifty-year projections, with one in the 1995, whereas the recent Mount Pinatubo eruption was in 1991. They found that the observed warming was similar to two of the three scenarios. The warming rates of the two most modest warming scenarios are nearly the same through the year 2000, and they were unable to provide a precise model assessment. They did note that the agreement between the observations and the intermediate scenario was accidental because the climate sensitivity used was higher than current estimates.\n\nA year later, Hansen joined with Rahmstorf and colleagues comparing climate projections with observations. The comparison is done from 1990 through January 2007 against physics-based models that are independent from the observations after 1990. They show that the climate system may be responding faster than the models indicate. Rahmstorf and coauthors show concern that sea levels are rising at the high range of the IPCC projections, and that it is due to thermal expansion and not from melting of the Greenland or Antarctic ice sheets.\n\nFollowing the launch of spacecraft capable of determining temperatures, Roy Spencer and John Christy published the first version of their satellite temperature measurements in 1990. Contrary to climate models and surface measurements, their results showed a cooling in the troposphere. However, in 1998, Wentz and Schabel determined that orbital decay had an effect on the derived temperatures. Hansen compared the corrected troposphere temperatures with the results of the published GISS model, and concluded that the model is in good agreement with the observations, noting that the satellite temperature data had been the last holdout of global warming denialists, and that the correction of the data would result in a change from discussing whether global warming is occurring to what is the rate of global warming, and what should be done about it.\n\nHansen has continued the development and diagnostics of climate models. For instance, he has helped look at the decadal trends in tropopause height, which could be a useful tool for determining the human \"fingerprint\" on climate. , the current version of the GISS model is Model E. This version has seen improvements in many areas, including upper-level winds, cloud height, and precipitation. This model still has problems with regions of marine stratocumulus clouds. A later paper showed that the model's main problems are having too weak of an ENSO-like variability, and poor sea ice modeling, resulting in too little ice in the Southern Hemisphere and too much in the Northern Hemisphere.\n\nIn 2000 Hansen authored a paper called \"Global warming in the twenty-first century: an alternative scenario\" in which he presented a more optimistic way of dealing with global warming, focusing on non-CO gases and black carbon in the short run, giving more time to make reductions in fossil fuel emissions. He notes that the net warming observed to date is roughly as big as that expected from non-CO gases only. This is because CO warming is offset by climate-cooling aerosols emitted with fossil fuel burning and because at that time non-CO gases, taken together, were responsible for roughly 50% of the anthropogenic greenhouse gas warming.\n\nIn a 2007 paper, Hansen discussed the potential danger of \"fast-feedback\" effects causing ice sheet disintegration, based on paleoclimate data. George Monbiot reports \"The IPCC predicts that sea levels could rise by as much as this century. Hansen's paper argues that the slow melting of ice sheets the panel expects doesn't fit the data. The geological record suggests that ice at the poles does not melt in a gradual and linear fashion, but flips suddenly from one state to another. When temperatures increased to 2–3°C (3.6–5.4°F) above today's level 3.5 million years ago, sea levels rose not by 59 centimeters but by . The ice responded immediately to changes in temperature.\"\n\nHansen stressed the uncertainties around these predictions. \"It is difficult to predict time of collapse in such a nonlinear problem … An ice sheet response time of centuries seems probable, and we cannot rule out large changes on decadal time-scales once wide-scale surface melt is underway.\" He concludes that \"present knowledge does not permit accurate specification of the dangerous level of human-made [greehouse gases]. However, it is much lower than has commonly been assumed. If we have not already passed the dangerous level, the energy infrastructure in place ensures that we will pass it within several decades.\"\n\nIn 2013, Hansen authored a paper called \"Climate sensitivity, sea level and atmospheric carbon dioxide,\" in which he estimated climate sensitivity to be (3±1)°C based on Pleistocene paleoclimate data. The paper also concluded that burning all fossil fuels \"would make most of the planet uninhabitable by humans.\"\n\nIn 2016, a team of 19 researchers led by Hansen published a paper \"Ice melt, sea level rise and superstorms: evidence from paleoclimate data, climate modeling, and modern observations that 2 °C global warming could be dangerous\" describing the effect of meltwater from ice sheets on the Atlantic meridional overturning circulation (slowing it or even stopping) and Antarctic bottom water formation. This would speed up ice sheet melting and sea level rise by increasing the water temperature at hundreds of meters depth, thawing ice shelves from below. And the cool fresh meltwater on the ocean close to Greenland and Antarctica leads to larger temperature difference between tropics and middle latitudes, what would enable storms as strong as in the last interglacial, Eemian, whose evidence are, among others, megaboulders on Bahamas.\n\nHansen noted that in determining responsibility for climate change, the effect of greenhouse gas emissions on climate is determined not by current emissions, but by accumulated emissions over the lifetime of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere.\n\nBy this measure, the U.K. is still the largest single cause of climate change, followed by the U.S. and Germany, even though its current emissions are surpassed by the People's Republic of China.\n\nOn public policy, Hansen is critical of what he sees as efforts to mislead the public on the issue of climate change. He points specifically to the Competitive Enterprise Institute's commercials with the tagline \"carbon dioxide—they call it pollution, we call it life\", and politicians who accept money from fossil-fuel interests and then describe global warming as \"a great hoax.\" He also says that changes needed to reduce global warming do not require hardship or reduction in the quality of life, but will also produce benefits such as cleaner air and water, and growth of high-tech industries. He was a critic of both the Clinton and George W. Bush Administrations' stances on climate change. Addressing the potential effects of climate change, Hansen has stated in an interview in January, 2009, \"We cannot now afford to put off change any longer. We have to get on a new path within this new administration. We have only four years left for Obama to set an example to the rest of the world. America must take the lead.\"\n\nHansen was invited to testify before the United States Senate Committee on Energy and Natural Resources on June 23, 1988. Hansen testified that \"Global warming has reached a level such that we can ascribe with a high degree of confidence a cause and effect relationship between the greenhouse effect and observed warming...It is already happening now\" and \"The greenhouse effect has been detected and it is changing our climate now...We already reached the point where the greenhouse effect is important.\" Hansen said that NASA was 99% confident that the warming was caused by the accumulation of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere and not a random fluctuation.\n\nAccording to science historian Spencer R. Weart, Hansen's testimony increased public awareness of climate change. According to Richard Besel of California Polytechnic State University, Hansen's testimony \"was an important turning point in the history of global climate change.\" According to Timothy M. O'Donnell of the University of Mary Washington, Hansen's testimony was \"pivotal,\" \"ignited public discussion of global warming and moved the controversy from a largely scientific discussion to a full blown science policy debate,\" and marked \"the official beginning of the global warming policy debate.\" According to Roger A. Pielke of the National Center for Atmospheric Research, Hansen's \"call to action\" \"elevated the subject of global warming and the specter of associated impacts such as more hurricanes, floods, and heat waves, to unprecedented levels of attention from the public, media, and policy makers.\"\n\nHansen has been particularly critical of the coal industry, stating that coal contributes the largest percentage of anthropogenic carbon dioxide into the atmosphere. He acknowledges that a molecule of carbon dioxide emitted from burning coal has the same effect as a molecule emitted from burning oil. The difference is where the fuel originally resides. He says that most oil comes from Russia and Saudi Arabia, and that no matter how fuel-efficient automobiles become, the oil will eventually be burned and the emitted. In a 2007 testimony before the Iowa Utilities Board, he stated that the United States has a large reservoir of coal, which makes it a resource that can be controlled through action by U.S. politicians, unlike oil which is controlled by other countries. He has called for phasing out coal power completely by the year 2030.\n\nDuring his testimony before the Iowa Utilities Board in 2007, Hansen likened coal trains to \"death trains\" and asserted that these would be \"no less gruesome than if they were boxcars headed to crematoria, loaded with uncountable irreplaceable species.\" In response, the National Mining Association stated that his comparison \"trivialized the suffering of millions\" and \"undermined his credibility.\" Citing the reactions of \"several people\" and \"three of his scientific colleagues\" as his primary motivation, Hansen stated that he certainly did not mean to trivialize suffering by the families who lost relatives in the Holocaust and then apologized, saying he regretted that his words caused pain to some readers.\n\nOn June 23, 2009, James Hansen, along with 30 other protesters including actress Daryl Hannah, was arrested on misdemeanor charges of obstructing police and impeding traffic, during a protest against mountaintop removal mining in Raleigh County, West Virginia. The protesters intended to enter the property of Massey Energy Company, but were blocked by a crowd of several hundred coal miners and supporters. Hansen said that mountaintop removal for coal mining \"[provides] only a small fraction of our energy\" and \"should be abolished.\" Hansen called on President Barack Obama to abolish mountaintop coal mining.\n\nHansen and about 100 other people were arrested in September 2010 in front of the White House in Washington, DC. The group was seeking a ban on mountaintop removal or surface mining.\n\nIn 2009 Hansen spoke out against cap and trade, advocating instead what he believes would be a progressive carbon tax at source carbon as oil, gas or coal, with a 100% dividend returned to citizens in equal shares, as proposed by Citizens Climate Lobby. He has made many appearances and talks supporting the work of CCL.\n\nHansen retired from NASA in April 2013 after 46 years of government service, saying he planned to take a more active role in the political and legal efforts to limit greenhouse gases. The same month, the National Center for Science Education, an organization noted for defending the teaching of evolution in United States science classrooms, named Hansen as an advisor to support the extension of its area of concern into the teaching of climate change.\n\nIn a CBC interview aired in April 2013, as Canadian Natural Resources Minister Joe Oliver lobbied in Washington, DC for approval of Keystone pipeline extension intended to carry more synthetic crude oil from Canada's Athabasca Oil Sands to the Gulf of Mexico, Hansen forcefully argued against the use of these unconventional fossil fuels. According to Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) and other energy organizations \"there is more than twice as much carbon in the tar sands oil\" than in conventional oil. Hansen argued that coal, tar sands, and tar shale should not be used as energy sources because of their carbon emissions and claimed that the completion of the Keystone pipeline would increase the extraction of oil from oil sands. He explained that the effects of climate change may not be apparent until the far future: \"It's not the case where you emit something and you see the effect. We see the beginnings of the effect but the large impacts are going to be in future decades and that science is crystal clear … Effects come slowly because of the inertia of the climate system. It takes decades, even centuries to get the full response. But we know the last time the world was 2 degrees warmer, sea level was 6 meters or 20 feet higher.\" Hansen urged President Obama to reject the Keystone pipeline extension intended to carry more synthetic crude oil from Canada's Athabasca Oil Sands to the Gulf of Mexico. On February 13, 2013, Hansen was again arrested at the White House, along with Daryl Hannah and Robert F. Kennedy, Jr., during a further protest against the proposed Keystone pipeline extension.\n\nRecently Hansen stated his support for a revenue-neutral fee and dividend system to impose a price on carbon that returns the money collected from the fossil fuel industry equally to all legal residents of the United States. In an interview on CBC television on March 3, 2015, Dr Hansen stated \"The solution [to climate change] has to be a rising price on carbon and then the really dirty fuels like tar sands would fall on the table very quickly. They make no sense at all if you look at it from an economic-wide perspective. If we would simply put a fee on carbon – you would collect from the fossil fuel companies at the source (the domestic mines or the ports of entry) and then distribute that money to the public, an equal amount to all legal residents, that would begin to make the prices honest. And that's what the economy needs in order to be most efficient. Right now the external costs of fossil fuels are borne completely by the public. If your child gets asthma, you pay the bill, the fossil fuel company doesn't. What we need is to make the system honest.\"\n\nAt the end of 2008, James Hansen stated five priorities that he felt then President-elect Barack Obama should adopt \"for solving the climate and energy problems, while stimulating the economy\": efficient energy use, renewable energy, a smart grid, generation IV nuclear reactors and carbon capture and storage. Regarding nuclear, he expressed opposition to the Yucca Mountain nuclear waste repository, stating that the $25 Billion (US) surplus held in the Nuclear Waste Fund \"should be used to develop fast reactors that consume nuclear waste, and thorium reactors to prevent the creation of new long-lived nuclear waste.\"\n\nIn 2009, Hansen wrote an open letter to President Obama where he advocated a \"Moratorium and phase-out of coal plants that do not capture and store CO\". In his first book \"Storms of My Grandchildren\", similarly, Hansen discusses his \"Declaration of Stewardship\", the first principle of which requires \"a moratorium on coal-fired power plants that do not capture and sequester carbon dioxide\".\n\nIn March 2013, Hansen co-authored a paper in \"Environmental Science & Technology\", entitled \"Prevented mortality and greenhouse gas emissions from historical and projected nuclear power\". The paper examined mortality rates per unit of electrical power produced from fossil fuels (coal and natural gas) as well as nuclear power. It estimated that 1.8 million air pollution-caused deaths were prevented worldwide between 1971 and 2009, through the use of nuclear power instead of fossil fuels. The paper also concluded that the emission of some 64 billion tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent were avoided by nuclear power use between 1971 and 2009. Looking to the future, between 2010 and 2050, it was estimated that nuclear could additionally avoid up to 420,000 to 7 million premature deaths and 80 to 240 billion tonnes of greenhouse gas emissions.\n\nThis paper elicited a critical response to Kharecha and Hansen's analysis, from an international group of senior academic energy policy analysts, including Benjamin Sovacool, M.V. Ramana, Mark Z. Jacobson, and Mark Diesendorf. They asserted that nuclear power needs large subsidies to be economically viable, and typically there are substantial construction delays and cost overruns associated with nuclear plants. Sovacool et al. also claim that Kharecha and Hansen's estimates of Chernobyl Disaster mortalities is very low, which biases their conclusions. All of these factors are said to make Kharecha and Hansen's article \"incomplete and misleading\". Kharecha and Hansen countered that all the data these scientists use to make their criticism, \"lacks credibility\".\n\nIn 2013, Hansen and three other leading climate experts wrote an open letter to policy makers, saying that \"continued opposition to nuclear power threatens humanity's ability to avoid dangerous climate change.\" The reaction from anti-nuclear environmental groups (e.g. the Natural Resources Defense Council, Sierra Club, and Greenpeace) was negative, citing nuclear safety and security issues, and the economics of nuclear power plants.\n\nHansen was elected to the National Academy of Sciences in 1996 for his \"development of pioneering radiative transfer models and studies of planetary atmospheres; development of simplified and three-dimensional global climate models; explication of climate forcing mechanisms; analysis of current climate trends from observational data; and projections of anthropogenic impacts on the global climate system.\" In 2001, he received the 7th Annual Heinz Award in the Environment (endowed with US$250,000) for his research on global warming, and was listed as one of Time Magazine's 100 Most Influential People in 2006. Also in 2006, the American Association for the Advancement of Science (AAAS) selected James Hansen to receive its Award for Scientific Freedom and Responsibility \"for his courageous and steadfast advocacy in support of scientists' responsibilities to communicate their scientific opinions and findings openly and honestly on matters of public importance.\"\n\nIn 2007, Hansen shared the US $1-million Dan David Prize for \"achievements having an outstanding scientific, technological, cultural or social impact on our world\". In 2008, he received the PNC Bank Common Wealth Award of Distinguished Service for his \"outstanding achievements\" in science. At the end of 2008, Hansen was named by EarthSky Communications and a panel of 600 scientist-advisors as the \"Scientist Communicator of the Year\", citing him as an \"outspoken authority on climate change\" who had \"best communicated with the public about vital science issues or concepts during 2008.\"\n\nIn 2009, Hansen was awarded the 2009 Carl-Gustaf Rossby Research Medal, the highest honor bestowed by the American Meteorological Society, for his \"outstanding contributions to climate modeling, understanding climate change forcings and sensitivity, and for clear communication of climate science in the public arena.\"\n\nHansen won the 2010 Sophie Prize, set up in 1997 by Norwegian Jostein Gaarder, the author of the 1991 best-selling novel and teenagers' guide to philosophy \"Sophie's World\", for his \" key role for the development of our understanding of human-induced climate change.\"\n\n\"Foreign Policy\" named Hansen one of its 2012 FP Top 100 Global Thinkers \"for sounding the alarm on climate change, early and often\".\n\nIn December 2012, Hansen received the Commonwealth Club of California's annual Stephen H. Schneider Award for Outstanding Climate Science Communications at a ceremony in San Francisco\n\nOn November 7, 2013 Hansen received the Joseph Priestley Award at Dickinson College in Carlisle, Pennsylvania \"...for his work advancing our understanding of climate change, including the early application of numerical models to better understand observed climate trends and to project humans' impact on climate, and for his leadership in promoting public understanding of climate and linking the knowledge to action on climate policy.\" He delivered a lecture, entitled, \"White House Arrest and the Climate Crisis,\" later that same day at Anita Tuvin Schlechter Auditorium on the college's campus.\n\nJames Hansen was co-winner with climatologist Syukuro Manabe of the BBVA Foundation Frontiers of Knowledge Award in the Climate Change category in the ninth edition (2016) of the awards. The two laureates were separately responsible for constructing the first computational models with the power to simulate climate behavior. Decades ago, they correctly predicted how much Earth's temperature would rise due to increasing atmospheric CO2. The scores of models currently in use to chart climate evolution are heirs to those developed by Manabe and Hansen.\n\nIn June 2018, Hansen was named joint winner, with Veerabhadran Ramanathan, of Taiwan's Tang Prize Foundation prize. Hansen's prize had a total value of NT$25 million.\n\nIn 2006, Hansen alleged that NASA administrators had attempted to influence his public statements about the causes of climate change. Hansen said that NASA public relations staff were ordered to review his public statements and interviews after a December 2005 lecture at the American Geophysical Union in San Francisco. NASA responded that its policies are similar to those of any other federal agency in requiring employees to coordinate all statements with the public affairs office without exception. Two years after Hansen and other agency employees described a pattern of distortion and suppression of climate science by political appointees, the agency's inspector general confirmed that such activities had taken place, with the NASA Office of Public Affairs having \"reduced, marginalized or mischaracterized climate change science made available to the general public\".\n\nIn June 2006, Hansen appeared on \"60 Minutes\" stating that the George W. Bush White House had edited climate-related press releases reported by federal agencies to make global warming seem less threatening. He also stated that he was unable to speak freely without the backlash of other government officials, and that he had not experienced that level of restrictions on communicating with the public during his career.\n\nIn 2008 interviews with \"ABC News\", \"The Guardian\", and in a separate op-ed, Hansen has called for putting fossil fuel company executives, including the CEOs of ExxonMobil and Peabody Coal, on trial for \"high crimes against humanity and nature\", on the grounds that these and other fossil-fuel companies had actively spread doubt and misinformation about global warming, in the same way that tobacco companies tried to hide the link between smoking and cancer.\n\nHansen and 1251 other activists were arrested in August and September 2011, at another demonstration in front of the White House. Hansen urged President Obama to reject the Keystone pipeline extension intended to carry more synthetic crude oil from Canada's Athabasca Tar Sands to the Gulf of Mexico. On February 13, 2013, Hansen was again arrested at the White House, along with Daryl Hannah and Robert F. Kennedy, Jr., during a further protest against the proposed Keystone pipeline extension.\n\nIn January 2009, Andrew Freedman wrote in \"The Washington Post\", that the American Meteorological Society had erred in giving Hansen its Carl-Gustaf Rossby Research Medal: \"His body of work is not at issue... Rather, the problem arises due to the AMS' recognition of Hansen's public communication work on climate change.\" Former AMS member Joseph D'Aleo, a skeptic of human-caused climate change, also criticized the award.\n\nAlso in 2009, physicist Freeman Dyson criticised Hansen's climate-change activism. \"The person who is really responsible for this overestimate of global warming is Jim Hansen. He consistently exaggerates all the dangers... Hansen has turned his science into ideology.\" Hansen responded that if Dyson \"is going to wander into something with major consequences for humanity and other life on the planet, then he should first do his homework\". Dyson stated in an interview that the argument with Hansen was exaggerated by \"The New York Times\", stating that he and Hansen are \"friends, but we don't agree on everything.\"\n\nAfter Hansen's arrest in 2009 in West Virginia, \"New York Times\" columnist Andrew Revkin wrote: \"Dr. Hansen has pushed far beyond the boundaries of the conventional role of scientists, particularly government scientists, in the environmental policy debate.\"\n\nIn June 2009, \"New Yorker\" journalist Elizabeth Kolbert wrote that Hansen is \"increasingly isolated among climate activists.\" Eileen Claussen, president of the Pew Center on Global Climate Change, said that \"I view Jim Hansen as heroic as a scientist... But I wish he would stick to what he really knows. Because I don't think he has a realistic idea of what is politically possible, or what the best policies would be to deal with this problem.\"\n\nIn July 2009, \"New York Times\" climate columnist Christa Marshall asked if Hansen still matters in the ongoing climate debate, noting that he \"has irked many longtime supporters with his scathing attacks against President Obama's plan for a cap-and-trade system.\" \"The right wing loves what he's doing,\" said Joseph Romm, a senior fellow at the Center for American Progress, a think tank. Hansen said that he had to speak out, since few others could explain the links between politics and the climate models. \"You just have to say what you think is right,\" he said.\n\n"}

Their drag character, Jinkx, is characterized as Jewish as a way of reconnecting with this part of their heritage. Hoffer also suffers from narcolepsy, a fact that they revealed in the season five premiere of \"RuPaul's Drag Race\".\n\nHoffer worked as a janitor through college and graduated with a BFA in theater from Cornish College of the Arts in 2010. They have lived in Seattle, Washington since 2006.\n\nHoffer identifies as \"non-gendered\" or non-binary, and prefers to go by singular they pronouns when not in drag. In an April 2017 interview, Monsoon stated, \"I've never identified as fully male. I've always identified as more gender fluid or gender ambiguous, but I never knew the vocabulary to explain it for myself.\"\n\nAfter moving to Seattle from Portland, Hoffer and creative partner Nick Sahoyah wrote and starred in multiple Funny or Die webisodes titled \"Monsoon Season\" in which they played Jinkx Monsoon as an over-bearing, substance addled, near-psychotic mother to Nick Sahoya's character, Kamikaze Monsoon.\n\nIn 2011, Monsoon appeared in the Wes Hurley film \"Waxie Moon in Fallen Jewel\". On February 28, 2013, the first screening at Seattle's Central Cinema was hosted by Monsoon and Waxie Moon.\n\nIn January 2012, Hoffer appeared as Moritz in the rock musical \"Spring Awakening\" at the Balagan Theater in Seattle. Controversy arose from \"The Seattle Times\" review by Misha Berson, who said that Hoffer was \"overly flamboyant\" for the role. Dan Savage defended Hoffer's portrayal of Moritz. From July 21 to August 19, Hoffer starred as Angel in the 5th Avenue Theatre's production of the musical \"RENT\".\n\nIn January 2013, Hoffer played Hedwig in the Moore Theatre's production of the rock musical \"Hedwig and the Angry Inch\". Balagan reprised the production in December 2013 for a week long run with Hoffer and the original cast/production team.\n\nIn June 2013 Hoffer played Velma Von Tussle in the Seattle Men's Chorus/5th Avenue Theatre's production of the musical \"Hairspray\" . This was a limited run staged reading/concert of the musical with costumes and limited props but no sets or elaborate choreography and featured the Seattle Men's Chorus onstage with the cast.\n\nHoffer also performs as Jinkx Monsoon in the original one act cabaret musical \"The Vaudevillians\" under the name \"Kitty Witless.\" Hoffer is accompanied by musical partner and co-creator Richard Andriessen, who performs under the name \"Dr. Dan Von Dandy.\" The Vaudevillians performed at the Laurie Beechman Theatre in New York City from July to November 2013. After touring Australia with \"The Vaudevillians\", Hoffer received a nomination for the Helpmann Award for Best Cabaret Performer.\n\nIn 2013 Hoffer was chosen as one of the Artists of the Year by City Arts Magazine along with Megan Griffiths, Macklemore, Ryan Lewis, and Wes Hurley.\n\nHoffer played Tallulah/Dennis, the owner of Lipstick Lounge in an episode of \"Blue Bloods\" entitled \"Manhattan Queens\", which aired on January 31, 2014.\n\nIn 2015 Hoffer joined the cast of Wes Hurley's hit comedy series \"Capitol Hill\".\n\nIn June 2011, Hoffer became subject to a YouTube docu-series by Alex Berry, a Seattle videographer. Named after \"Death Becomes Her\", one of Jinkx's favorite movies, \"Drag Becomes Him\" explores Hoffer's life in and out of drag. The series has continued since the finale of \"RuPaul's Drag Race\" and will offer insight into their life since the show.\n\nIn October 2013 it was announced that \"Drag Becomes Him\" was being turned into a feature-length film with Seattle-based producer Basil Shadid on board. A Kickstarter campaign in March 2014 successfully raised funds to complete the project. March 26, 2015 Hoffer announced on their Instagram page that the film will premiere at the Cinerama in Seattle on April 29, 2015.\n\nIn November 2012, Logo announced that Jinkx Monsoon was among fourteen drag queens who would be competing on the fifth season of \"RuPaul's Drag Race\". Hoffer was inspired to audition after seeing Sharon Needles, another high-concept, character-driven drag queen, on the fourth season of the show. Monsoon won the main-challenges for the episodes \"Snatch Game\" and \"Drama Queens.\" For the \"Snatch Game,\" Monsoon impersonated Edith Bouvier Beale. Monsoon also impersonated third-season contestant Mimi Imfurst in the episode \"Lip Synch Extravaganza Eleganza.\" As part of \"RuPaul's Drag Race\", Monsoon sang on the \"We Are the World\"-inspired song \"Can I Get an Amen?\" The song's proceeds helped benefit the Los Angeles Gay and Lesbian Center. Monsoon won \"RuPaul's Drag Race\" season 5.\n\nHoffer's drag persona is inspired by their mother and the comedians Lucille Ball, Maria Bamford, Deven Green, and Sarah Silverman. Their drag persona's last name, Monsoon, is derived from the character Edina Monsoon from the British sitcom \"Absolutely Fabulous\". Hoffer also performs as the drag character Deirde A.

{"id": "27592108", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=27592108", "title": "Joe Miller (Alaska politician)", "text": "Joe Miller (Alaska politician)\n\nJoseph Wayne Miller (born May 10, 1967) is an American attorney and politician.\n\nMiller rose to national prominence as the Republican Party nominee and the Tea Party favorite in the 2010 U.S. Senate election in Alaska. He faced Democrat Scott McAdams and incumbent Republican Senator Lisa Murkowski who, after losing the primary to Miller, mounted a large and well-funded campaign as a write-in candidate in the general election and went on to win the Senate seat.\n\nBefore running for the Senate, Miller worked as an attorney in private general practice, a local government attorney, and a U.S. magistrate judge assisting the Alaska federal district court with its caseload. A 1995 graduate of Yale Law School, he was a combat veteran of the 1991 Gulf War, and a graduate of the U.S. Military Academy at West Point. He is originally from Kansas and the father of eight children; he and his wife and family moved to Alaska in the mid-1990s.\n\nMiller sought the Republican nomination to challenge incumbent Democratic Senator Mark Begich in 2014, but was defeated by Dan Sullivan in the Republican primary.\n\nCean Stevens, the Libertarian party primary winner, stepped aside to allow Miller to receive the Libertarian nomination, so that Miller could run in the crowded 2016 Senate election. He placed second in the general election, receiving just under 30% of the vote.\n\nMiller was born and raised in Osborne, Kansas, the son of Sharry and Rex Miller. His father was a minister who owned a Christian book and gift store. He attended elementary school in Salina, Kansas and Salina Central High School, participating in debate, forensics, and student congress, and graduating in 1985.\n\nHe has said that growing up during the Vietnam War era made him aware of the military, and eventually led to his enrollment at the United States Military Academy at West Point in 1985. While at West Point, he was a member of the Officer's Christian Fellowship and the Hunting and Fishing and Survival Games clubs. Miller later graduated from Yale Law School with a Juris Doctor degree.\n\nMiller served three years of active duty in the United States Army. An armor officer, he served in the 2nd Battalion, 34th Armor Regiment within the 1st Infantry Division at Fort Riley, Kansas. In 1991 Miller deployed to the Persian Gulf War, where he served as a leader of a tank platoon that helped drive Saddam Hussein's army from Kuwait. His superiors called him \"a true warrior leader tested under fire\" and he received a Bronze Star for leadership in combat. He has a service-connected hearing loss. He was honorably discharged on September 1, 1992, during a time when the U.S. was downsizing its military. He then served in the U.S. Army Reserve until his honorable discharge on May 30, 1997.\n\nFollowing his discharge from active duty, Miller attended Yale Law School, where he was a member of the flagship chapter of the Federalist Society. He moved to Alaska in 1995 after earning his law degree, and accepted a position with Condon Partnow & Sharrock, a law firm in Anchorage.\n\nDuring Miller's Senate campaign, Alaskan media criticized him for his 1995 sworn application in which he claimed to be indigent and a one-year continuous resident of Alaska to obtain a hunting and fishing license for $5, a $295 discount from the non-resident fee. The campaign responded that Miller had been a full-time student the previous year living on student loans, and that he was an Alaska resident when he purchased the license.\n\nMiller was appointed a state court magistrate for the remote village of Tok, as well as a superior court master for the Alaska's Fourth Judicial District in 1998. During his U.S. Senate campaign, Miller, who had said federal entitlement programs are unconstitutional, was criticized for having received federal assistance from Medicaid and a federally funded Alaska health care program for low income families at this time of his life. His campaign responded that Miller had not received the aid since 2002. Miller said he did not oppose the state program itself, but did oppose its expansion. In 2002, after moving to Fairbanks, Miller was appointed an acting state District Court judge for several months.\n\nFrom 2002 to 2004 he also served as a part-time U.S. magistrate judge, employing his wife for part of that time as a clerical assistant.\n\nIn 2010, while Miller was being scrutinized by the media, allegations were made that he had violated nepotism rules by hiring his wife, and he was criticized because she collected unemployment compensation after being forced to quit the job. Miller responded that the nepotism rules were different at the time she was hired, and the court verified that he initially had clearance from his superiors to employ her. Miller's former supervising judge on the federal court later criticized Miller for quitting the federal magistrate job without notice in 2004, saying it left Fairbanks without a judicial officer for many months, and gave him a \"negative opinion\" of Miller.\n\nMiller spent seven years as a part-time assistant attorney for the Fairbanks North Star Borough (2002–2009) while maintaining a private law practice from which he earned the bulk of his income. One of his major cases as borough assistant attorney involved successfully defending the borough's levy of a tax increase on the companies that own the Trans-Alaska Pipeline. In 2008 he misused the borough's computers for political purposes (to pad a poll as part of his campaign for Republican Party state chair).\n\nHe was disciplined for his actions and for lying about them when first confronted by his superiors, facts that became public knowledge during the last ten days of the 2010 Senate campaign. His supervisor said that Miller was under stress at the time. He resigned from the assistant attorney post in September 2009 over disputes involving a possible conflict of interest in a case and his request for time off under the Family and Medical Leave Act. As of early December 2010, the borough was considering pursuing charges against Miller for deleting more than 15,000 e-mails in the days following his resignation. Miller's attorney responded that it was routine to delete non-essential e-mails and that the borough's inquiries were an attempt to threaten a candidate and illegally interfere with an election. The Alaska Republican Party chair, Randy Ruedrich, said the borough was engaging in \"cheap drama\".\n\nIn 2008 Miller earned a master's degree in Resource and Applied Economics from the University of Alaska Fairbanks. He currently lives in Fairbanks, where he owns a law practice.\n\nIn 2004 Miller ran for a seat in the Alaska House of Representatives, winning the Republican primary. He ran as a moderate Republican in the general election, but lost to Democratic incumbent David Guttenberg.\n\nIn 2008, while serving as Interior regional chairman of the Alaska Republican Party, he unsuccessfully tried to oust Randy Ruedrich as the state Republican Party chairman. The \"Alaska Dispatch\" described Miller's effort as part of a power struggle between \"the old guard versus the new Palin-led faction\", reporting that Miller arrived at the state Republican Party convention accompanied by a security detail of four bodyguards. Miller resigned his regional chairmanship and temporarily quit the GOP the day after the 2008 convention.\n\nMiller announced his candidacy in April 2010 saying that the U.S. republic needed to be defended from a \"head-long plunge into socialism and more government control\". His chief opponent for the Republican nomination was incumbent U.S. Senator Murkowski. He quickly picked up endorsements from current and former Alaska politicians including State Senators Fred Dyson and John Coghill, and State Representative Tammie Wilson. Former Governor Sarah Palin endorsed Miller's candidacy in early June 2010. The Tea Party Express began funding TV, radio, and direct mail ads on Miller's behalf shortly after, spending $600,000 on what the \"Los Angeles Times\" called a \"blitz\" of \"attack ads\" against Murkowski. Miller said he spent approximately $100,000 of his own funds on the primary campaign. \"The New York Times\" described Murkowski as an establishment candidate and called Miller a \"Tea Party upstart\", and the race was viewed as a test of the power of the Tea party movement.\n\nMiller won the August 24 primary by garnering 1,668 more votes than Murkowski, according to the initial count. Murkowski did not concede until one week later when, after more than 15,000 absentee and other uncounted ballots were tallied, she still remained 1,630 votes behind Miller.\n\nMiller faced two candidates in the general election, Democrat Scott McAdams, and Lisa Murkowski, who announced a write-in campaign on September 17.\n\nAfter securing the Republican Party nomination, he received backing from the state Republican Party, Senator Jim DeMint, and the National Republican Senatorial Committee. Various groups from outside Alaska endorsed Miller and contributed large sums of money to his general election campaign, including the Tea Party Express, the Safari Club International, and the National Right to Life Committee. Alaska's only representative in the House, Republican Don Young, declined to endorse either Murkowski or Miller. Sarah Palin appeared at a campaign rally with Miller for the first time in late October 2010.\n\nDuring his general election campaign, Miller said he supported sharp reductions in federal spending and stronger states' rights. He told the Washington D.C. newspaper \"The Hill\" that the nation's problems were caused by activist judges who had permitted government growth and allowed dependency and \"the entitlement state to grab hold\".\n\nThe Democratic National Committee and other Democrats began painting him as a far right candidate. Confident of his election, Miller told the media that he wanted to serve on the Senate Judiciary and Armed Services committees.\n\nFollowing a mid-October leak of information about his work record as a borough attorney, Miller held a news conference telling reporters that he was drawing a line in the sand and would not answer any more questions about his past.\n\nMiller received national press attention after campaign security guards handcuffed and made a 30-minute private arrest of a journalist following a town hall campaign event in an Anchorage public school on October 17, 2010.\n\nBill Fulton, the owner of the unlicensed security firm said the journalist, Tony Hopfinger, was trespassing at a private event and had assaulted a Miller supporter by shoving him. Fulton was subsequently named as the federal informant who supplied weapons to a radical accused of plotting the deaths of officials in Fairbanks. The \"Anchorage Daily News\" described the event as public, and a school district spokesperson noted that the hallway where the arrest took place was a public area. Hopfinger said he had been trying to ask Miller whether he had been disciplined while working as a local government lawyer, when he was suddenly surrounded by guards and supporters, and bumped or shoved against one of them. No charges were filed against anyone in relation to the incident.\n\nMiller responded that Hopfinger's actions were \"beyond the pale\" because he had followed Miller into the men's room. Hopfinger said that he asked no questions until after the townhall event when both men were back in the hallway.\n\nAfter the incident, Miller granted interviews and discussed certain issues regarding his past employment with national news outlets, though he had previously refused to discuss the same issues with the Alaskan media. The information about Miller's discipline and suspension that Hopfinger was attempting to ask Miller about was released by the borough on October 26, in response to a lawsuit filed by several Alaska news organizations.\n\nIn late October 2010, Sarah Palin announced on Fox News Channel that the Anchorage CBS-TV affiliate, KTVA, had been conspiring to make up stories about Miller and that the campaign had proof. It seemed that KTVA personnel had failed to hang up a phone after leaving a message for Miller's campaign spokesman and that their later comments were recorded on the spokesman's voicemail. During the conversation, they laughingly considered tweeting about chaos at a Miller rally, and falsely reporting that sex offenders were there. The station's general manager initially took no action, saying the remarks were taken out of context, but he later fired two producers involved, and canceled two newscasts to hold a staff meeting discussing ethics in journalism.\n\nOn November 3, the winner remained undetermined; write-in ballots comprised 41% of the vote, Miller had 34%, and McAdams had 24%. McAdams later conceded, but the result required a hand-count of the write-in ballots to see what names were written on them. Miller's campaign manager announced that several teams, including attorneys, would be going to Alaska to watch the ballot count. Miller gained about 2,100 votes in the count of absentee ballots that was done on November 9 in Juneau, and trailed the write-in votes by 11,333 at the end of the day. The hand count of the write-in ballots began on November 10. After two days, the Alaska Division of Elections had examined about 48 percent of the ballots and had tallied about 98 percent of them as votes for Murkowski, despite objections from Miller's team of observers to spelling errors, legibility, and additional words such as \"Republican\". When the last of the more than 100,000 write-in votes were counted on November 17, the Associated Press and the Republican Party of Alaska called the race for Murkowski. At that point, Murkowski's lead was more than 2,000 votes larger than the number of ballots challenged by Miller. On November 18, Murkowski declared victory, but Miller did not concede the race.\n\nMiller hoped to win the Senate seat by means of a federal lawsuit that he filed on November 9, 2010. He alleged that Alaska election officials were violating the of the U.S. Constitution and the Equal Protection Clause of the 14th Amendment because they were using a voter intent standard to determine which ballots to count for Murkowski. He argued that the State statute regarding write-in votes should be strictly applied and asked the federal court to throw out all the ballots that misspelled the name \"Murkowski\", or that did not write in Murkowski's name exactly as it appeared on the list of write-in candidates.\n\nHe cited an Alaska election statute that states: \"The rules set out in this section are mandatory and there are no exceptions to them. A ballot may not be counted unless marked in compliance with these rules.\" Election officials said that state case law allowed them to use discretion in counting ballots with misspellings or other variations.\n\nThe first judge assigned to the case recused himself because he said he had a negative opinion of Miller dating to 2004 when he was Miller's judicial supervisor. Miller filed a preliminary injunction as part of the suit, asking that the federal judge immediately order the State to stop counting the ballots, due to irreparable harm that would happen if the counting continued, but the request was denied.\n\nThe votes challenged by Miller's team were put in separate boxes, leaving it to the lawsuit to decide whether they would be counted for Murkowski. On November 11, the Miller campaign alleged it had received reports of voter intimidation and fraud and that it would be filing a lawsuit in Alaska state court asking for voters rolls for certain precincts to determine whether the precincts had counted more ballots than there were registered voters. Miller told Fox News Channel on November 18 that his campaign may request a recount, investigate the voting machines, and look into whether the absentee ballots for the military were mailed in a timely fashion. The federal judge held the suit could be decided by reference to State law, and directed Miller to file in State court, which he did on November 22, stopping the certification of election results and possibly delaying the seating of a second Senator for Alaska at the beginning of the new term in January.\n\nMiller's Alaska state court lawsuit essentially repeated his federal suit allegations, but added new charges of voter fraud, claiming that precinct election officials had allowed voting without proper identification, and claiming that identical handwriting was suspiciously found on multiple ballots, which was also a violation of the requirement that a voter must personally pen a write-in ballot. Miller offered a new argument at a December 8 hearing; that hundreds of convicted sex offenders and possibly other felons were allowed to vote in the November election. On December 10, the Alaska Superior Court ruled against all of Miller's claims, finding the hand count of the write-in ballots valid.\n\nThe court said that the State statute does not require perfect spelling, and said that if the State legislature intended exact spelling it, would have said so. The emphasis, the court said, should be on making sure voters are not disenfranchised. The judge also wrote, \"To allow for write-in votes with less than a perfect spelling of a candidate's name, as long as voter intent is clear ...[is] a commonsense interpretation, which the court believes would be evident to most Alaskans\". The judge also rejected Miller's demands for a hand count of all the ballots cast in the election, not just those with write-in votes, because state law did not provide for it.\n\nHe dismissed Miller's claims of possible vote fraud as based on speculation, \"Miller's affidavits do not provide any facts of wrongful conduct at polling stations and not even circumstantial evidence of wrongdoing,\" he said. The Miller campaign responded to the ruling by stating that votes that did not meet the standard established by the state legislature were not valid, and that that equal protection and fundamental fairness required a hand count of all the votes and an investigation of fraud allegations. The judge allowed a brief stay so that Miller could appeal to the Alaska Supreme Court.\n\nOn December 22, 2010, the Alaska Supreme Court upheld a lower court decision and denied Miller's suit. The high court, in its ruling, called voter intent \"paramount,\" and said \"any misspelling, abbreviation, or other minor variation in the form of the candidate's name on a write-in ballot does not invalidate a ballot so long as the intention of the voter can be ascertained.\" and \"The State characterizes the standard urged by Miller as the 'perfection standard,' and we agree that such a standard would tend to disenfranchise many Alaskans on the basis of 'technical errors\".\n\nOn December 28, U.S. District Judge Ralph Beistline dismissed Miller's claim and allowed certification of the election of Senator Lisa Murkowski to go forward without delay.\n\nOn December 30, 2010, Alaska state officials certified the election of Lisa Murkowski as the winner of the Senatorial election, making her the first U.S. Senate candidate to win election via write-in since Strom Thurmond in 1954. Miller conceded the race on December 31.\n\nIn June 2011, a judge found that Miller's lawsuit was aimed at winning the election and not in the interest of upholding the state constitution as Miller had claimed. He was ordered to compensate the State of Alaska approximately $18,000 for legal fees incurred by the State.\n\nMiller ran in the 2014 U.S. Senate election as a Republican, although a late-race endorsement of Miller by former governor Sarah Palin did not yield a win, as former Alaska Attorney General and Commissioner of Natural Resources Daniel S. Sullivan won the primary on August 19, 2014, with 40% of the vote, having vastly outspent Miller (who gathered 32%) and Lt. Governor Mead Treadwell (25%) combined.\n\nAfter Cean Stevens, the winner of the Libertarian primary, stepped aside in the 2016 2016 U.S. Senate election, Miller received the Libertarian nomination in order to again challenge incumbent Republican Senator Lisa Murkowski. He said he would not be supporting Gary Johnson, the Libertarian presidential nominee, however, and would instead vote for Donald Trump. He is also, contrary to the Libertarian national platform, opposed to abortion and same-sex marriage. Miller again lost to Murkowski in a four-way race, taking 29% of the vote.\n\nHe opposes federal aid programs such as federal farm subsidies, the federal minimum wage, and unemployment benefits.\n\nHe would eliminate the U.S. Department of Education.\n\nMiller supports a repeal of the Seventeenth Amendment to the United States Constitution, which would return the election of U.S. Senators to the state legislatures.\n\nHe would reduce American foreign aid.\n\nHe would vote to repeal the 2010 health care legislation.\n\nHe opposes cuts to Medicare or Social Security benefits for current retirees. He supports privatizing (or \"personalizing\") Social Security and Medicare for younger workers. He would remove the federal government as the social security provider and give states the option of providing their own social security type programs.\n\nHe has said that scientific evidence for global warming is \"dubious at best\".\n\nMiller opposes abortion, including in cases of rape and incest, and would allow it only when the mother's life is in danger. He describes himself as pro-life.\n\nHe supports the death penalty.\n\nMiller stated at a town hall meeting that he believed East Germany was an example of a nation taking effective measures to control the flow of people across a border. Miller believes illegal immigration is a \"critically important\" issue to deal with because of its economic effects on health care, education and employment. Miller wants to secure the border to stop more immigrants from entering America illegally and protect the country from possible terrorist threats. Miller does not believe the millions of immigrants already here illegally should be granted amnesty. Miller supports efforts by states such as Arizona to enforce immigration laws when the federal government will not, and he believes illegal immigrants should be deported when they come into contact with law enforcement officials.\n\nMiller is married and the father of six children and the step father of two.\n\n"}

{"id": "23453940", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=23453940", "title": "John J. Pershing", "text": "John J. Pershing\n\nGeneral of the Armies John Joseph \"Black Jack\" Pershing (September 13, 1860 – July 15, 1948) was a senior United States Army officer. His most famous post was when he served as the commander of the American Expeditionary Forces (AEF) on the Western Front in World War I, 1917–18.\n\nPershing rejected British and French demands that American forces be integrated with their armies, and insisted that the AEF would operate as a single unit under his command, although some American divisions fought under British command, and he also allowed all-black units to be integrated with the French army.\n\nPershing's soldiers first saw serious battle at Cantigny, Chateau-Thierry, Belleau Wood, and Soissons. To speed up the arrival of the doughboys, they embarked for France leaving the heavy equipment behind, and used British and French tanks, artillery, airplanes and other munitions. In September 1918 at St. Mihiel, the First Army was directly under Pershing's command; it overwhelmed the salient – the encroachment into Allied territory – that the German Army had held for three years. For the Meuse-Argonne Offensive, Pershing shifted roughly 600,000 American soldiers to the heavily defended forests of the Argonne, keeping his divisions engaged in hard fighting for 47 days, alongside the French. The Allied Hundred Days Offensive, which the Argonne fighting was part of, contributed to Germany calling for an armistice. Pershing was of the opinion that the war should continue and that all of Germany should be occupied in an effort to permanently destroy German militarism.\n\nPershing is the only American to be promoted in his own lifetime to General of the Armies rank, the highest possible rank in the United States Army. Allowed to select his own insignia, Pershing chose to use four gold stars to distinguish himself from those officers who held the rank of General, which was signified with four silver stars. After the creation of the five-star General of the Army rank during World War II, his rank of General of the Armies could unofficially be considered that of a six-star general, but he died before the proposed insignia could be considered and acted on by Congress.\n\nSome of his tactics have been criticized both by other commanders at the time and by modern historians. His reliance on costly frontal assaults, long after other Allied armies had abandoned such tactics, has been blamed for causing unnecessarily high American casualties. In addition to leading the A.E.F. to victory in World War I, Pershing notably served as a mentor to many in the generation of generals who led the United States Army during World War II, including George Marshall, Dwight D. Eisenhower, Omar Bradley, Lesley J. McNair, George S. Patton, and Douglas MacArthur.\n\nPershing was born on a farm near Laclede, Missouri, to businessman John Fletcher Pershing and homemaker Ann Elizabeth Thompson. Pershing's great-great-grandfather, Frederick Pershing, whose name originally was Pfersching, emigrated from Alsace, leaving Amsterdam on the ship \"Jacob\", and arriving in Philadelphia on October 2, 1749. Pershing's mother was of English descent. He also had five siblings: brothers James F. (1862–1933) and Ward (1874–1909), and sisters Mary Elizabeth (1864–1928), Anna May (1867–1955) and Grace (1867–1903); three other children died in infancy. When the Civil War began, his father supported the Union and was a sutler for the 18th Missouri Volunteer Infantry.\n\nPershing attended a school in Laclede that was reserved for precocious students who were also the children of prominent citizens. Completing high school in 1878, he became a teacher of local African American children. While pursuing his teaching career, Pershing also studied at the State Normal School (now Truman State University) in Kirksville, Missouri, from which he graduated in 1880 with a bachelor of science degree in scientific didactics. Two years later, he applied to the United States Military Academy. Pershing later admitted that serving in the military was secondary to attending West Point, and he had applied because the education offered was better than that obtainable in rural Missouri.\n\nPershing was sworn in as a West Point cadet in the fall of 1882. He was selected early for leadership positions and became successively First Corporal, First Sergeant, First Lieutenant, and First Captain, the highest possible cadet rank. Pershing also commanded, \"ex officio,\" the honor guard that saluted the funeral train of President Ulysses S. Grant as it passed West Point in August 1885.\n\nPershing graduated in the summer of 1886 ranked 30th in his class of 77, and was commissioned a second lieutenant; he was commended by the West Point Superintendent, General Wesley Merritt, who said Pershing gave early promise of becoming an outstanding officer. Pershing briefly considered petitioning the Army to let him study law and delay the start of his mandatory military service. He also considered joining several classmates in a partnership that would pursue development of an irrigation project in Oregon. He ultimately decided against both courses of action in favor of active Army duty.\n\nPershing reported for active duty on September 30, 1886, and was assigned to Troop L of the 6th U.S. Cavalry stationed at Fort Bayard, in the New Mexico Territory. While serving in the 6th Cavalry, Pershing participated in several Indian campaigns and was cited for bravery for actions against the Apache. During his time at Fort Stanton, Pershing and close friends Lt. Julius Penn and Lt. Richard B. Paddock were nicknamed \"The Three Green P's,\" spending their leisure time hunting and attending Hispanic dances. Pershing's sister Grace married Paddock in 1890.\n\nBetween 1887 and 1890, Pershing served with the 6th Cavalry at various postings in California, Arizona, and North Dakota. He also became an expert marksman and, in 1891, was rated second in pistol and fifth in rifle out of all soldiers in the U.S. Army.\n\nOn December 9, 1890, Pershing and the 6th Cavalry arrived at Sioux City, Iowa, where Pershing played a role in suppressing the last uprisings of the Lakota (Sioux) Indians. Though he and his unit did not participate in the Wounded Knee Massacre, they did fight three days after it on January 1, 1891 when Sioux warriors attacked the 6th Cavalry's supply wagons. When the Sioux began firing at the wagons, Pershing and his troops heard the shots, and rode more than six miles to the location of the attack. The cavalry fired at the forces of Chief War Eagle, causing them to retreat. This would be the only occasion where Pershing would see action in the Ghost Dance campaign.\n\nIn September 1891 he was assigned as the Professor of Military Science and Tactics at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln, a position he held until 1895. While carrying out this assignment, Pershing attended the university's College of Law, from which he received his LL.B. degree in 1893. He formed a drill company of chosen university cadets, Company A. In March 1892, it won the Maiden Prize competition of the National Competitive Drills in Omaha, Nebraska. The Citizens of Omaha presented the company with a large silver cup, the \"Omaha Cup.\" On October 2, 1894, former members of Company A established a fraternal military drill organization named the Varsity Rifles. The group renamed itself the Pershing Rifles in 1895 in honor of its mentor and patron. Pershing maintained a close relationship with Pershing Rifles for the remainder of his life.\n\nOn October 20, 1892, Pershing was promoted to first lieutenant and in 1895 took command of a troop of the 10th Cavalry Regiment, one of the original Buffalo Soldier regiments composed of African-American soldiers under white officers. From Fort Assinniboine in north central Montana, he commanded an expedition to the south and southwest that rounded up and deported a large number of Cree Indians to Canada.\n\nIn 1897, Pershing was appointed to the West Point tactical staff as an instructor, where he was assigned to Cadet Company A. Because of his strictness and rigidity, Pershing was unpopular with the cadets, who took to calling him \"Nigger Jack\" because of his service with the 10th Cavalry.\n\nDuring the course of his tour at the Academy, this epithet softened to \"Black Jack,\" although, according to Vandiver, \"the intent remained hostile.\" Still, this nickname would stick with Pershing for the rest of his life, and was known to the public as early as 1917.\n\nAt the start of the Spanish–American War, First Lieutenant Pershing was the regimental quartermaster for the 10th Cavalry; he fought on Kettle and San Juan Hills in Cuba, and was cited for gallantry. In 1919, he was awarded the Silver Citation Star for these actions, and in 1932 the award was upgraded to the Silver Star decoration. A commanding officer here commented on Pershing's calm demeanor under fire, saying he was \"cool as a bowl of cracked ice.\". Pershing also served with the 10th Cavalry during the siege and surrender of Santiago de Cuba.\n\nPershing was commissioned as a major of United States Volunteers on August 26, 1898, and assigned as an ordnance officer. In March 1899, after suffering from malaria, Pershing was put in charge of the Office of Customs and Insular Affairs which oversaw occupation forces in territories gained in the Spanish–American War, including Cuba, Puerto Rico, the Philippines, and Guam. He was honorably discharged from the volunteers and reverted to his permanent rank of first lieutenant on May 12, 1899. He was again commissioned as a major of Volunteers on June 6, 1899, this time as an assistant adjutant general.\n\nWhen the Philippine–American War began, Pershing reported to Manila on August 17, 1899, was assigned to the Department of Mindanao and Jolo, and commanded efforts to suppress the Filipino Insurrection. On November 27, 1900, Pershing was appointed Adjutant General of his department and served in this posting until March 1, 1901. He was cited for bravery for actions on the Cagayan River while attempting to destroy a Philippine stronghold at Macajambo.\n\nPershing wrote in his autobiography that \"The bodies [of some Moro outlaws] were publicly buried in the same grave with a dead pig.\" This treatment was used against captured \"juramentado\" so that the Moro would believe they would be going to hell. Pershing added that \"it was not pleasant [for the Army] to have to take such measures\". Historians do not believe that Pershing was directly involved with such incidents, or that he personally gave such orders to his subordinates. Letters and memoirs from soldiers describing events similar to this do not have credible evidence of Pershing having been personally involved. Similarly, the claim made by Donald Trump during his presidential campaign in February 2016 that Pershing executed 49 \"Muslim terrorists\" with bullets dipped in pig's blood, then let the 50th go free to spread the word about the religious atrocity, which Trump alluded to again while serving as president in August 2017, has been repeatedly debunked by historians, who find no evidence that such an incident occurred.\n\nOn June 30, 1901, Pershing was honorably discharged from the Volunteers and he reverted to the rank of captain in the Regular Army to which he had been promoted on February 2, 1901. He served with the 1st Cavalry Regiment in the Philippines. He later was assigned to the 15th Cavalry Regiment, serving as an intelligence officer and participating in actions against the Moros. He was cited for bravery at Lake Lanao. In June 1901, he served as Commander of Camp Vicars in Lanao, Philippines, after the previous camp commander had been promoted to brigadier general.\n\nIn June 1903, Pershing was ordered to return to the United States. President Theodore Roosevelt, taken by Pershing's ability, petitioned the Army General Staff to promote Pershing to colonel. At the time, Army officer promotions were based primarily on seniority rather than merit, and although there was widespread acknowledgment that Pershing should serve as a colonel, the Army General Staff declined to change their seniority-based promotion tradition just to accommodate Pershing. They would not consider a promotion to lieutenant colonel or even major. This angered Roosevelt, but since the President could only name and promote army officers in the General ranks, his options for recognizing Pershing through promotion were limited.\n\nIn 1904, Pershing was assigned as the Assistant Chief of Staff of the Southwest Army Division stationed at Oklahoma City, Oklahoma. In October 1904, he attended the Army War College, and then was ordered to Washington, D.C. for \"general duties unassigned.\"\n\nSince Roosevelt could not yet promote Pershing, he petitioned the United States Congress to authorize a diplomatic posting, and Pershing was stationed as military attaché in Tokyo in 1905. Also in 1905, Pershing married Helen Frances Warren, the daughter of powerful U.S. Senator Francis E. Warren, a Wyoming Republican who served at different times as chairman of the Military Affairs and Appropriations Committees. This union with the daughter of a powerful politician who had also received the Medal of Honor during the American Civil War continued to aid Pershing's career even after his wife died in 1915.\n\nAfter serving as an observer in the Russo-Japanese War attached to General Kuroki Tamemoto's Japanese First Army in Manchuria from March to September, Pershing returned to the United States in the fall of 1905. President Roosevelt employed his presidential prerogative and nominated Pershing as a brigadier general, a move which Congress approved. In skipping three ranks and more than 835 officers senior to him, the promotion gave rise to accusations that Pershing's appointment was the result of political connections and not military abilities. However, several other junior officers were similarly advanced to brigadier general ahead of their peers and seniors, including Albert L. Mills (captain), Tasker H. Bliss (major), and Leonard Wood (captain). Pershing's promotion, while unusual, was not unprecedented, and had the support of many soldiers who admired his abilities.\n\nIn 1908, Pershing briefly served as a U.S. military observer in the Balkans, an assignment which was based in Paris. Upon returning to the United States at the end of 1909, Pershing was assigned once again to the Philippines, an assignment in which he served until 1913. While in the Philippines, he served as Commander of Fort McKinley, near Manila, and also was the governor of the Moro Province. The last of Pershing's four children was born in the Philippines, and during this time he became an Episcopalian.\n\nIn 1913 Pershing was recommended for the Medal of Honor following his actions at the Battle of Bud Bagsak. He wrote to the Adjutant General to request that the recommendation not be acted on, though the board which considered the recommendation had already voted no before receiving Pershing's letter. In 1922 a further review of this event resulted in Pershing being recommended for the Distinguished Service Cross, but as the Army Chief of Staff Pershing disapproved the action. In 1940 Pershing received the Distinguished Service Cross for his heroism at Bud Bagsak, with President Franklin D. Roosevelt presenting it in a ceremony timed to coincide with Pershing's 80th birthday.\n\nDuring this period Pershing's reputation for both stern discipline and effective leadership continued to grow, with one experienced old soldier under his command later saying Pershing was an \"S.O.B.\" and that he hated Pershing's guts, but that \"as a soldier, the ones then and the ones now couldn't polish his (Pershing's) boots.\"\n\nOn December 20, 1913, Pershing received orders to take command of the 8th Brigade at the Presidio in San Francisco. With tensions running high on the border between the United States and Mexico, the brigade was deployed to Fort Bliss, Texas on April 24, 1914, arriving there on the 27th.\n\nAfter a year at Fort Bliss, Pershing decided to take his family there. The arrangements were almost complete, when on the morning of August 27, 1915, he received a telegram informing him of a fire in the Presidio in San Francisco, where a lacquered floor caught fire and the flames rapidly spread, resulting in the smoke inhalation deaths of his wife, Helen Frances Warren, and three young daughters, Mary, age 3, Anne, age 7, and Helen, age 8. Only his 6-year-old son Francis Warren survived. After the funerals at Lakeview Cemetery in Cheyenne, Wyoming, Pershing returned to Fort Bliss with his son, Warren, and his sister May, and resumed his duties as commanding officer.\n\nTwo years after the death of his wife and children, Pershing courted Anne Wilson \"Nita\" Patton, the younger sister of his protégé, George S. Patton. Pershing met her when she traveled to Fort Bliss to visit her brother, and he introduced them. Pershing and Nita Patton soon began a relationship; they became engaged in 1917, but their separation because of Pershing's time in France during World War I ended it. Pershing had wartime affairs, including one with Micheline Resco (1894–1968), an artist who painted his portrait, and he later expressed regret that he had let Nita Patton \"get away\". Nita Patton never married, while Pershing married French-Romanian portrait artist Micheline Resco in his Walter Reed Hospital apartment in 1946. Pershing was 85 at the time and Resco was 50.\n\nOn March 15, 1916, Pershing led an expedition into Mexico to capture Pancho Villa. This expedition was ill-equipped and hampered by a lack of supplies due to the breakdown of the Quartermaster Corps. Although there had been talk of war on the border for years, no steps had been taken to provide for the handling of supplies for an expedition. Despite this and other hindrances, such as the lack of aid from the former Mexican government, and their refusal to allow American troops to transport troops and supplies over their railroads, Pershing organized and commanded the Mexican Punitive Expedition, a combined armed force of 10,000 men that penetrated into Mexico. They routed Villa's revolutionaries, but failed to capture him.\n\nAt the start of the United States' involvement in World War I President Woodrow Wilson considered mobilizing an army to join the fight. Frederick Funston, Pershing's superior in Mexico, was being considered for the top billet as the Commander of the American Expeditionary Force (AEF) when he died suddenly from a heart attack on February 19, 1917. Pershing was the most likely candidate other than Funston, and following America's entrance into the war in May, Wilson briefly interviewed Pershing, and then selected him for the command. He was officially installed in the position on May 10, 1917, and held the post until 1918. On October 6, 1917, Pershing, then a major general, was promoted to full general in the National Army. He bypassed the three star rank of lieutenant general, and was the first full general since Philip Sheridan in 1888. As AEF commander, Pershing was responsible for the organization, training, and supply of a combined professional and draft Army and National Guard force that eventually grew from 27,000 inexperienced men to two Armies, with a third forming as the war ended, totaling over two million soldiers.\n\nPershing exercised significant control over his command, with a full delegation of authority from Wilson and Secretary of War Newton D. Baker. Baker, cognizant of the endless problems of domestic and allied political involvement in military decision making in wartime, gave Pershing unmatched authority to run his command as he saw fit. In turn, Pershing exercised his prerogative carefully, not engaging in politics or disputes over government policy that might distract him from his military mission. While earlier a champion of the African-American soldier, he did not advocate their full participation on the battlefield, understanding the general racial attitudes of white Americans. In addition, Wilson held reactionary views on race and owed political debts to southern Democratic politicians.\n\nGeorge Marshall served as one of Pershing's top assistants during and after the war. Pershing's initial chief of staff was James Harbord, who later took a combat command but worked as Pershing's closest assistant for many years and remained extremely loyal to him.\n\nAfter departing from Fort Jay at Governors Island in New York Harbor under top secrecy in May 1917, Pershing arrived in France in June 1917. In a show of American presence, part of the 16th Infantry Regiment marched through Paris shortly after his arrival. Pausing at the tomb of Gilbert du Motier, Marquis de Lafayette, he was reputed to have uttered the famous line \"Lafayette, we are here,\" a line spoken, in fact, by his aide, Colonel Charles E. Stanton. American forces were deployed in France in the autumn of 1917.\n\nIn September 1917 the French government commissioned a portrait of Pershing by 23-year-old Romanian artist Micheline Resco. Pershing removed the stars and flag from his car and sat up front with his chauffeur while traveling from his AEF headquarters to visit her by night in her apartment on the rue Descombes. Their friendship continued for the rest of his life. In 1946, at 85, Pershing secretly wed French-Romanian portrait artist Micheline Resco in his Walter Reed Hospital apartment. Resco was 35 years his junior\n\nFor the first time in American history, Pershing allowed American soldiers to be under the command of a foreign power. In late June, General Rawlinson, commanding the British Fourth Army, suggested to Australian Lieutenant General John Monash that American involvement in a set-piece attack alongside the experienced Australians in the upcoming Battle of Hamel would both give the American troops experience and also strengthen the Australian battalions by an additional company each. On June 29, General Bell, commanding the American 33rd Division, selected two companies each from the 131st and 132nd Infantry regiments of the 66th brigade. Monash had been promised ten companies of American troops and on June 30 the remaining companies of the 1st and 2nd battalions of the 131st regiment were sent. Each American platoon was attached to an Australian company, but there was difficulty in integrating the American platoons (which numbered 60 men) among the Australian companies of 100 men. This difficulty was overcome by reducing the size of each American platoon by one-fifth and sending the troops thus removed, which numbered 50 officers and men, back to battalion reinforcement camps.\n\nThe day before the attack was scheduled to commence, Pershing learnt of the plan and ordered the withdrawal of six American companies. While a few Americans, such as those attached to the 42nd Battalion, disobeyed the order, the majority, although disappointed, moved back to the rear. This meant that battalions had to rearrange their attack formations and caused a serious reduction in the size of the Allied force. For example, the 11th Brigade was now attacking with 2,200 men instead of 3,000. There was a further last-minute call for the removal of all American troops from the attack, but Monash, who had chosen 4 July as the date of the attack out of \"deference\" to the US troops, protested to Rawlinson and received support from Field Marshal Douglas Haig, commander of the British Expeditionary Force. The four American companies that had joined the Australians during the assault were withdrawn from the line after the battle and returned to their regiments, having gained valuable experience. Monash sent Bell his personal thanks, praising the Americans' gallantry, while Pershing set out explicit instructions to ensure that US troops would not be employed in a similar manner again.\n\nUnder civilian control of the military, Pershing adhered to the racial policies of President Woodrow Wilson, Secretary of War Newton D. Baker, and southern Democrats who promoted the \"separate but equal\" doctrine. African-American \"Buffalo Soldiers\" units were not allowed to participate with the American Expeditionary Force (AEF) during World War I, but experienced non-commissioned officers were provided to other segregated black units for combat service—such as the 317th Engineer Battalion. The American Buffalo Soldiers of the 92nd and 93rd Infantry Divisions were the first American soldiers to fight in France in 1918, but they did so under French command as Pershing had detached them from the AEF. Most regiments of the 92nd and all of the 93rd would continue to fight under French command for the duration of the war.\n\nIn early 1918, entire divisions were beginning to serve on the front lines alongside French troops. Pershing insisted that the AEF fight as units under American command rather than being split up by battalions to augment British and French regiments and brigades (although the 27th and 30th Divisions, grouped under II Corps command, were loaned during the desperate days of spring 1918, fought with the British/Australian/Canadian Fourth Army until the end of the war, taking part in the breach of the Hindenburg Line in October).\n\nIn October 1918, Pershing saw the need for a dedicated Military Police Corps and the first U.S. Army MP School was established at Autun, France. For this, he is considered the founding father of the United States MPs.\n\nBecause of the effects of trench warfare on soldiers' feet, in January 1918, Pershing oversaw the creation of an improved combat boot, the \"1918 Trench Boot,\" which became known as the \"Pershing Boot\" upon its introduction.\n\nAmerican forces first saw serious action during the summer of 1918, contributing eight large divisions, alongside 24 French ones, at the Second Battle of the Marne. Along with the British Fourth Army's victory at Amiens, the Allied victory at the Second Battle of the Marne marked the turning point of World War I on the Western Front.\n\nIn August 1918 the U.S. First Army had been formed, first under Pershing's direct command and then by Lieutenant General Hunter Liggett, when the U.S. Second Army under Lieutenant General Robert Bullard was created. After a quick victory at Saint-Mihiel, east of Verdun, some of the more bullish AEF commanders had hoped to push on eastwards to Metz, but this did not fit in with the plans of the Allied Supreme Commander, Marshal Foch, for three simultaneous offensives into the \"bulge\" of the Western Front (the other two being the Fourth Army's breach of the Hindenburg Line and an Anglo-Belgian offensive, led by Plumer's Second Army, in Flanders). Instead, the AEF was required to redeploy and, aided by French tanks, launched a major offensive northwards in very difficult terrain at Meuse-Argonne. Initially enjoying numerical odds of eight to one, this offensive eventually engaged 35 or 40 of the 190 or so German divisions on the Western Front, although to put this in perspective, around half the German divisions were engaged on the British Expeditionary Force (BEF) sector at the time.\n\nThe offensive was marked by a Pershing failure, specifically his reliance on massed infantry attacks with little artillery support led to high casualty rates in the capturing of three key points. This was despite the AEF facing only second-line German troops after the decision by Erich Ludendorff, the German Chief of Staff, to withdraw to the Hindenburg Line on October 3–and in notable contrast to the simultaneous British breakthrough of the Hindenburg Line in the north. Pershing was subsequently forced to reorganize the AEF with the creation of the Second Army, and to step down as the commander of the First Army.\n\nWhen he arrived in Europe, Pershing had openly scorned the slow trench warfare of the previous three years on the Western Front, believing that American soldiers' skill with the rifle would enable them to avoid costly and senseless fighting over a small area of no-man's land. This was regarded as unrealistic by British and French commanders, and (privately) by a number of Americans such as Army Chief of Staff General Tasker Bliss and even Liggett. Even German generals were negative, with Ludendorff dismissing Pershing's strategic efforts in the Meuse-Argonne offensive by recalling how \"the attacks of the youthful American troops broke down with the heaviest losses\". The AEF had performed well in the relatively open warfare of the Second Battle of the Marne, but the eventual American casualties against German defensive positions in the Argonne (roughly 120,000 American casualties in six weeks, against 35 or 40 German divisions) were not noticeably better than those of the Franco-British offensive on the Somme two years earlier (600,000 casualties in four and a half months, versus 50 or so German divisions). More ground was gained, but by this stage of the war the German Army was in worse shape than in previous years.\n\nSome writers have speculated that Pershing's frustration at the slow progress through the Argonne was the cause of two incidents which then ensued. First, he ordered the U.S. First Army to take \"the honor\" of recapturing Sedan, site of the French defeat in 1870; the ensuing confusion (an order was issued that \"boundaries were not to be considered binding\") exposed American troops to danger not only from the French on their left, but even from one another, as the 1st Division tacked westward by night across the path of the 42nd Division (accounts differ as to whether Brigadier General Douglas MacArthur, then commanding the 84th Brigade of the 42nd Division, was really mistaken for a German officer and arrested). Liggett, who had been away from headquarters the previous day, had to sort out the mess and implement the instructions from the Allied Supreme Command, Marshal Foch, allowing the French to recapture the city; he later recorded that this was the only time during the war in which he lost his temper.\n\nSecond, Pershing sent an unsolicited letter to the Allied Supreme War Council, demanding that the Germans not be given an armistice and that instead, the Allies should push on and obtain an unconditional surrender. Although in later years, many, including President Franklin D. Roosevelt, felt that Pershing had been correct, at the time, this was a breach of political authority. Pershing narrowly escaped a serious reprimand from Wilson's aide, \"Colonel\" Edward M. House, and later apologized.\n\nAt the time of the Armistice, another Franco-American offensive was due to start on November 14, thrusting towards Metz and into Lorraine, to take place simultaneously with further BEF advances through Belgium.\n\nIn his memoirs, Pershing claimed that the American breakout from the Argonne at the start of November was the decisive event leading to the German acceptance of an armistice, because it made untenable the Antwerp–Meuse line. This is probably an exaggeration; the outbreak of civil unrest and naval mutiny in Germany, the collapse of Bulgaria, the Ottoman Empire, and particularly Austria-Hungary following Allied victories in Salonika, Syria, and Italy, and the Allied victories on the Western Front were among a series of events in the autumn of 1918 which made it clear that Allied victory was inevitable, and diplomatic inquiries about an armistice had been going on throughout October. President Wilson was keen to tie matters up before the mid-term elections, and as the other Allies were running low on supplies and manpower, they followed Wilson's lead.\n\nAmerican successes were largely credited to Pershing, and he became the most celebrated American leader of the war. Critics, however, claimed that Pershing commanded from far behind the lines and was critical of commanders who personally led troops into battle. MacArthur saw Pershing as a desk soldier, and the relationship between the two men deteriorated by the end of the war. Similar criticism of senior commanders by the younger generation of officers (the future generals of World War II) was made in the British and other armies, but in fairness to Pershing, although it was not uncommon for brigade commanders to serve near the front and even be killed, the state of communications in World War I made it more practical for senior generals to command from the rear. He controversially ordered his troops to continue fighting after the armistice was signed. This resulted in 3,500 American casualties on the last day of the war, an act which was regarded as murder by several officers under his command.\n\nThe year of 1918 also saw a personal health struggle for Pershing as he was sickened during the 1918 flu pandemic, but unlike many who were not so fortunate, Pershing survived. He rode his horse, Kidron, in the Paris victory parade in 1919.\n\nIn 1919, in recognition of his distinguished service during World War I, the U.S. Congress authorized the President to promote Pershing to General of the Armies of the United States, the highest rank possible for any member of the United States armed forces, which was created especially for him. (In 1976 Congress authorized President Gerald Ford to posthumously promote George Washington to this rank as part of the United States Bicentennial; Washington previously held the rank of General in the Continental Army, and wore a three-star insignia; his earlier date of rank in the 1976 promotion ensured that Washington would always be considered the U.S. Army's highest-ranking officer.) Pershing was authorized to create his insignia for the new rank and chose to wear four gold stars for the rest of his career, which distinguished his insignia from the four (temporary) silver stars worn by Army Chiefs of Staff of the 1910s and early 1920s.\n\nIn 1919, Pershing created the Military Order of the World War as an officer's fraternity for veterans of the First World War, modeled after the Military Order of Foreign Wars. Both organizations still exist today and welcome new officer members to their ranks. Pershing himself would join the MOFW in 1924.\n\nThere was a movement to draft Pershing as a candidate for president in 1920; he refused to campaign, but indicated that he \"wouldn't decline to serve\" if the people wanted him. Though Pershing was a Republican, many of his party's leaders considered him too closely tied to the policies of the Democratic Party's President Wilson. Another general, Leonard Wood, was the early Republican front runner, but the nomination went to Senator Warren G. Harding of Ohio, who went on to win the general election.\n\nIn 1921, Pershing became Chief of Staff of the United States Army, serving for three years. He created the Pershing Map, a proposed national network of military and civilian highways. The Interstate Highway System instituted in 1956 bears considerable resemblance to the Pershing map. On his 64th birthday, September 13, 1924, Pershing retired from active military service. (Army regulations from the late 1860s to the early 1940s required officers to retire on their 64th birthday.)\n\nOn November 1, 1921, Pershing was in Kansas City to take part in the groundbreaking ceremony for the Liberty Memorial that was being constructed there, (now known as the National World War I Museum and Memorial). Also present that day were Lieutenant General Baron Jacques of Belgium, Admiral of the Fleet David Beatty of Great Britain, Marshal Ferdinand Foch of France, and General Armando Diaz of Italy. One of the main speakers was Vice President Calvin Coolidge. In 1935, bas-reliefs of Pershing, Jacques, Foch and Diaz by sculptor Walker Hancock were added to the memorial. Pershing also laid the cornerstone of the World War Memorial in Indianapolis on July 4, 1927.\n\nOn October 2, 1922, amid several hundred officers, many of them combat veterans of World War I, Pershing formally established the Reserve Officers Association (ROA) as an organization at the Willard Hotel in Washington, D.C. ROA is a 75,000-member, professional association of officers, former officers, and spouses of all the uniformed services of the United States, primarily the Reserve and United States National Guard. It is a congressionally chartered Association that advises the Congress and the President on issues of national security on behalf of all members of the Reserve Component.\n\nIn 1924 Pershing became a member of the Pennsylvania Society of the Sons of the American Revolution. He was also an honorary member of the Society of the Cincinnati and a Veteran Companion of the Military Order of Foreign Wars.\n\nPershing served on a committee of the Sons of the American Revolution to establish and recognize Constitution Day in the United States.\n\nDuring the 1930s, Pershing largely retreated to private life, but returned to the public eye with publication of his memoirs, \"My Experiences in the World War\", which were awarded the 1932 Pulitzer Prize for history. He was also an active Civitan during this time.\n\nIn 1940, before and after the Fall of France, Pershing was an outspoken advocate of aid for the United Kingdom during World War II. In August 1940, he publicly supported the \"Destroyers for Bases Agreement\", whereby the United States sold fifty warships from World War I to the UK in exchange for lengthy leases of land on British possessions for the establishment for military bases.\n\nIn 1944, with Congress' creation of the five star rank of General of the Army, Pershing was still considered to be the highest-ranking officer of the United States military as his rank was General of the Armies. \"In [1799] Congress created for George Washington the rank of General of the Armies ... General [Ulysses S.] Grant received the title of General of the Army in 1866 . ... Carefully Congress wrote a bill (HR 7594) to revive the rank of General of the Armies for General Pershing alone to hold during his lifetime. The rank would cease to exist upon Pershing's death.\" Later, when asked if this made Pershing a five-star general, Secretary of War Henry L. Stimson commented that it did not, since Pershing never wore more than four stars, but that Pershing was still to be considered senior to the present five-star generals of World War II.\n\nIn July 1944, Pershing was visited by Free French leader General Charles de Gaulle. When Pershing asked after the health of his old friend, Marshal Philippe Pétain – who had headed the pro-German Vichy regime until it was dissolved in late 1942 – de Gaulle replied tactfully that, when he last saw him, the Marshal was well.\n\nOn July 15, 1948, Pershing died of coronary artery disease and congestive heart failure at Walter Reed General Hospital in Washington, D.C., which was his home after 1944. He lay in state at the United States Capitol rotunda and following a state funeral, he was buried in Arlington National Cemetery, near the grave sites of the soldiers he commanded in Europe.\n\nIt was during his initial assignment in the American West that Pershing's mother died. On March 16, 1906, his father died.\n\nColonel Francis Warren Pershing (1909–1980), John J. Pershing's son, served in the Second World War as an advisor to the Army Chief of Staff, General George C. Marshall. After the war he continued with his financial career and founded a stock brokerage firm, Pershing & Company. He was father to two sons, Richard W. Pershing (1942–1968) and John Warren Pershing III (1941–1999). Richard Pershing served as a second lieutenant in the 502nd Infantry and was killed in action on February 17, 1968, in Vietnam. John Pershing III served as a special assistant to former Army Chief of Staff General Gordon R. Sullivan, also attaining the rank of colonel. He helped shape army and the ROTC programs nationwide. Colonel Pershing died of cardiovascular disease in 1999.\n\n\n\n\nFor extraordinary heroism against hostile fanatical Moros at Mount Bagsak, Jolo, Philippine Islands on June 15, 1913. He personally assumed command of the assaulting line at the most critical period when only about 15 yards from the last Moro position. His encouragement and splendid example of personal heroism resulted in a general advance and the prompt capture of the hostile stronghold.\n\nIn 1941 he was awarded the Distinguished Service Cross for extraordinary heroism in action leading an against hostile Moros at Mount Bagsak, on the island of Jolo in the Philippines on June 15, 1913.\n\n\nIn 1932, eight years after Pershing's retirement from active service, his silver citation star was upgraded to the Silver Star decoration. In 1941, he was retroactively awarded the Army of Occupation of Germany Medal for service in Germany following the close of World War I. As the medal had a profile of Pershing on its obverse, Pershing became the only soldier in the history of the U.S. Army, and only one of four in the entire U.S. Armed Forces, eligible to wear a medal with his own likeness on it. Navy admirals George Dewey, William T. Sampson and Richard E. Byrd were also entitled to wear medals with their own image on them.\n\n\n\n\n\nInformational notes\nCitations\nBibliography\n\n"}

During his years at MIT he was involved with the Monarch and Daedalus human powered aircraft teams.\n\nCruz is a senior aerospace engineer in the Exploration Systems Engineering Branch at the NASA Langley Research Center in Hampton, Virginia. His responsibilities are focused on research and development of entry, descent, and landing (EDL) systems for robotic and human exploration missions. He was a member of the highly successful Mars Exploration Rover (MER) and Mars Science laboratory (MSL) projects that placed rovers on the surface of Mars in 2004 and 2012. His contributions to the MER and MSL projects centered on the design and qualification of the supersonic parachute.\n\nThe MER-A rover, \"Spirit\", was launched on June 10, 2003 at 17:59 UTC, and MER-B, \"Opportunity\", on July 7, 2003. \"Spirit\" landed in Gusev crater on January 4, 2004 and \"Opportunity\" landed in the Meridiani Planum on the opposite side of Mars from \"Spirit\", on January 25, 2004. Cruz was among the scientists from Langley who helped develop the parachute which helped slow the spacecraft during entry, descent and landing.\n\nAccording to Cruz: \n\nThere are challenges to testing these parachutes because we can not test it at exactly the right conditions. Earth's atmosphere is the one we have to work with and the Martian atmosphere is very different, so you have to make adjustments in how you test the parachute. Another issue is the wind tunnel models we used in our tests were ten-percent scale models, about five feet in diameter.\n\nCruz is also a member of the Phoenix (Mars 2007), Mars Science Laboratory (Mars 2011), and Crew Exploration Vehicle EDL teams. He has undertaken research on advanced missions to Mars, including robotic airplanes, as well as having been a technical reviewer for the Genesis, Huygens, and Stardust missions. Prior to his involvement with exploration programs he conducted research on high-altitude unmanned aircraft.\n\n"}

It is the headquarters of the district of Kodagu.\n\nMadikeri was formerly known as \"Muddu raja keri\". \"Muddurajakeri\" which means Mudduraja's town, was named after the prominent Haleri king Mudduraja who ruled Kodagu from 1633 to 1687.\n\nThe history of Madikeri is related to the history of Kodagu. From the 2nd to the 6th century AD, the northern part of Kodagu was ruled by Kadambas. The southern part of Kodagu was ruled by Gangas from the 4th to the 11th century. After defeating the Gangas in the 11th century, Cholas became the rulers of Kodagu. In the 12th century, the Cholas lost Kodagu to the Hoysalas. Kodagu fell to the Vijayanagar kings in the 14th century. After their fall, the local chieftains like Karnambahu (\"Palegars\") started ruling their areas directly. They were defeated by Haleri Dynasty founder Veeraraju, (Nephew of Ikkeri Sadashiva Nayaka who were descendants of Talakadu Ganga Dynasty). In the year 1700AD Ikkeri Somashekara Nayaka gifted Puttur and Amara Sullia Magnes of Tulunadu to Haleri Kings. Descendants of Veeraraju who are known as \"Haleri Dynasty\" ruled Kodagu from 1600-1834 AD. Haleri king Mudduraja built the Fort in Madikeri and made it as their capital. Mudduraja, the third Haleri king started leveling the land around Madikeri and built a fort in the year 1681. Madikeri Fort which was original built of mud and was replaced by Tipu Sultan. Kodagu became the part of British India after 1834 AD.\n\n India census, Madikeri had a population of 47,257. Males constitute 57.2% of the population and females 42.8%. Madikeri had an average literacy rate of 81%, higher than the national average of 57.2: male literacy was 83%, and female literacy 79%. 11% of the population was under 6 years of age.

{"id": "19867", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=19867", "title": "Max Newman", "text": "Max Newman\n\nMaxwell Herman Alexander Newman, FRS, (7 February 1897 – 22 February 1984), generally known as Max Newman, was a British mathematician and codebreaker. His work in World War II led to the construction of Colossus, the world's first operational, programmable electronic computer, and he established the Royal Society Computing Machine Laboratory at the University of Manchester, which produced the world's first working, electronic stored-program electronic computer in 1948, the Manchester Baby.\n\nMax Newman was born Maxwell Herman Alexander Neumann in Chelsea, London, England, to a Jewish family, on 7 February 1897. His father was Herman Alexander Neumann, originally from the German city of Bromberg (now in Poland) who had emigrated with his family to London at the age of 15. Herman worked as a secretary in a company, and married Sarah Ann (Pike), an English schoolteacher, in 1896.\n\nThe family moved to Dulwich in 1903, and Newman attended Goodrich Road school, then City of London School from 1908. At school, he excelled in classics and in mathematics. He played chess and the piano well.\n\nNewman won a scholarship to study mathematics at St John's College, Cambridge in 1915, and in 1916 gained a First in Part I of the Cambridge Mathematical Tripos.\n\nHis studies were interrupted by World War I. His father was interned as an enemy alien after the start of the war in 1914, and upon his release he returned to Germany. In 1916, Herman changed his name by deed poll to the anglicised \"Newman\" and Sarah did likewise in 1920. In January 1917 Newman took up a teaching post at Archbishop Holgate's Grammar School in York, leaving in April 1918. He spent some months in the Royal Army Pay Corps, and then taught at Chigwell School for six months in 1919 before returning to Cambridge. He was called up for military service in February 1918, but claimed conscientious objection due to his beliefs and his father's country of origin, and thereby avoided any direct role in the fighting.\n\nHe resumed his interrupted studies in October 1919, and graduated in 1921 as a Wrangler (equivalent to a First) in Part II of the Mathematical Tripos, and gained distinction in Schedule B (the equivalent of Part III). His dissertation considered the use of \"symbolic machines\" in physics, foreshadowing his later interest in computing machines.\n\nOn 5 November 1923 he was elected a Fellow of St John's. He worked on the foundations of combinatorial topology, and proposed that a notion of equivalence be defined using only three elementary \"moves\". Newman's definition avoided difficulties that had arisen from previous definitions of the concept. Publishing over twenty papers established his reputation as an \"expert in modern topology\". Newman wrote \"Elements of the topology of plane sets of points\", a work on general topology and undergraduate text. He also published papers on mathematical logic, and solved a special case of Hilbert's fifth problem.\n\nHe was appointed a lecturer in mathematics at Cambridge in 1927, where his 1935 lectures on the Foundations of Mathematics and Gödel's theorem inspired Alan Turing to embark on his pioneering work on the \"Entscheidungsproblem\" (decision problem) using a hypothetical computing machine. In spring 1936, Newman was presented by Turing with a draft of \"On Computable Numbers with an Application to the Entscheidungsproblem\". He realised the paper's importance and helped ensure swift publication. Newman subsequently arranged for Turing to visit Princeton where Alonzo Church was working on the same problem but using his Lambda calculus. During this period, Newman started to share Turing's dream of building a stored-program computing machine.\n\nDuring this time at Cambridge, he developed close friendships with Patrick Blackett, Henry Whitehead and Lionel Penrose.\n\nIn September 1937, Newman and his family accepted an invitation to work for six months at Princeton. At Princeton, he worked on the Poincaré Conjecture and, in his final weeks there, presented a proof. However, in July 1938, after he returned to Cambridge, Newman discovered that his proof was fatally flawed.\n\nIn 1939, Newman was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society.\n\nIn December 1934 he married Lyn Lloyd Irvine, a writer, with Patrick Blackett as best man. They had two sons, Edward (born 1935) and William (born 1939).\n\nThe United Kingdom declared war on Germany on 3 September 1939. Newman's father was Jewish, which was of particular concern in the face of Nazi Germany, and Lyn, Edward and William were evacuated to America in July 1940 (where they spent three years before returning to England in October 1943). After Oswald Veblen—maintaining 'that every able-bodied man ought to be carrying a gun or hand-grenade and fight for his country'—opposed moves to bring him to Princeton, Newman remained at Cambridge and at first continued research and lecturing.\n\nBy spring 1942, he was considering involvement in war work. He made enquiries. After Patrick Blackett recommended him to the Director of Naval Intelligence, Newman was sounded out by Frank Adcock in connection with the Government Code and Cypher School at Bletchley Park.\n\nNewman was cautious, concerned to ensure that the work would be sufficiently interesting and useful, and there was also the possibility that his father's German nationality would rule out any involvement in top-secret work. The potential issues were resolved by the summer, and he agreed to arrive at Bletchley Park on 31 August 1942. Newman was invited by F. L. (Peter) Lucas to work on Enigma but decided to join Tiltman's group working on Tunny.\n\nHe was assigned to the Research Section and set to work on a German teleprinter cipher known as \"Tunny\". He joined the \"Testery\" in October. Newman enjoyed the company but disliked the work and found that it was not suited to his talents. He persuaded his superiors that Tutte's method could be mechanised, and he was assigned to develop a suitable machine in December 1942. Shortly afterwards, Edward Travis (then operational head of Bletchley Park) asked Newman to lead research into mechanised codebreaking.\n\nWhen the war ended, Newman was presented with a silver tankard inscribed 'To MHAN from the Newmanry, 1943-45'.\n\nConstruction started in January 1943, and the first prototype was delivered in June 1943. It was operated in Newman's new section, termed the \"Newmanry\", was housed initially in Hut 11 and initially staffed by himself, Donald Michie, two engineers, and 16 Wrens. The Wrens nicknamed the machine the \"Heath Robinson\", after the cartoonist of the same name who drew humorous drawings of absurd mechanical devices.\n\nThe Robinson machines were limited in speed and reliability. Tommy Flowers of the Post Office Research Station, Dollis Hill had experience of thermionic valves and built an electronic machine, the Colossus computer which was installed in the Newmanry. This was a great success and ten were in use by the end of the war.\n\nIn September 1945, Newman was appointed head of the Mathematics Department and to the Fielden Chair of Pure Mathematics at the University of Manchester.\n\nNewman lost no time in establishing the renowned Royal Society Computing Machine Laboratory at the University. In February 1946, he wrote to John von Neumann, expressing his desire to build a computing machine. The Royal Society approved Newman's grant application in July 1946. Frederic Calland Williams and Thomas Kilburn, experts in electronic circuit design, were recruited from the Telecommunications Research Establishment. Kilburn and Williams built Baby, the world's first electronic stored-program digital computer based on Alan Turing's and John von Neumann's ideas.\n\nAfter the Automatic Computing Engine suffered delays and set backs, Turing accepted Newman's offer and joined the Computer Machine Laboratory in May 1948 as Deputy Director (there being no Director). Turing joined Kilburn and Williams to work on Baby's successor, the Manchester Mark I. Collaboration between the University and Ferranti later produced the Ferranti Mark I, the first mass-produced computer to go on sale.\n\nNewman retired in 1964 to live in Comberton, near Cambridge. After Lyn's death in 1973 he married Margaret Penrose, widow of his friend Lionel Penrose.\n\nHe continued to do research on combinatorial topology during a period when England was a major centre of activity notably Cambridge under the leadership of Christopher Zeeman. Newman made important contributions leading to an invitation to present his work at the 1962 International Congress of Mathematicians in Stockholm at the age of 65, and proved a Generalized Poincaré conjecture for topological manifolds in 1966.\n\nAt the age of 85, Newman began to suffer from Alzheimer's disease. He died in Cambridge two years later.\n\n\nThe Newman Building at Manchester was named in his honour. The building housed the pure mathematicians from the Victoria University of Manchester between moving out of the Mathematics Tower in 2004 and July 2007 when the School of Mathematics moved into its new Alan Turing Building, where a lecture room is named in his honour.\n\nIn 1946, Newman declined the offer of an OBE as he considered the offer derisory. Alan Turing had been appointed an OBE six months earlier and Newman felt that it was inadequate recognition of Turing's contribution to winning the war, referring to it as the \"ludicrous treatment of Turing\".\n\n\n"}

Qureshi also served as the senior vice president of World Bank.\n\nMoeenuddin Ahmad Qureshi was born in Lahore, Punjab, British India, on 26 June 1930. He hailed from a distinguished family that was originally from Kasur. His father, Mohyeddin Ahmad Qureshi, was a civil servant in the British government and his mother, Khursheed Jabin, was a housewife. He attended the Islamia College in Lahore and made a transfer to the Government College University in Lahore where he gained B.A. (Honors) in Economics and received an M.A. in Economics from the Punjab University.\n\nHe received the Fulbright scholarship and went to the United States to attend the Indiana University in Bloomington, Indiana, where he earned a PhD in Economics in 1955.\n\nIn 1955, he returned to Pakistan and joined the country's civil service and was initially posted at the Planning Commission. In 1956, he resigned from the Planning Commission and went to the United States to join the International Monetary Fund (IMF). He enjoyed a distinguished career at the IMF, eventually serving as economic adviser to Ghana in 1960. Thereafter, he moved on to join the International Finance Corporation and eventually become its Executive Vice President from 1974 until 1977. Qureshi oversaw the global operations which involved the financing of private enterprises and investments, including joint ventures and capital market operations in developing countries.\n\nIn 1981, he was invited by the then President of the World Bank, Robert McNamara, to join the World Bank and become the senior vice president of finance, which he remained until 1987. Eventually, he was appointed the Senior Vice President of the World Bank and oversaw its financial operations all over the world. In 1991–92, he left the World Bank and settled in the United States and formed a private Hedge fund, the Emerging Market Associates.\n\nIn 1993, Pakistan averted a major constitutional crisis when both Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif and President Ghulam Ishaq Khan resigned from their respective offices after an agreement brokered by the Pakistani military. The resolution was unique because an elected government had voluntarily stepped down in order to avoid possible military intervention and the resignations came through a constitutional process.\n\nThe Chief of Army Staff, General Abdul Waheed Kakar, and the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Committee, General Shamim Alam, witnessed the implementation of the agreement as President Ghulam Ishaq was to be replaced by the Chairman of the Senate, Wasim Sajjad, who took over as the Acting President.\n\nMeanwhile, Qureshi, who was visiting Singapore in 1993, received a telephone call from President Ghulam Ishaq asking him to form a caretaker, but technocratic, government. He reluctantly accepted the offer and returned to Islamabad soon after. At the time of his appointment, Qureshi was largely unknown to the public and political circles. It was, however, felt that, being a political outsider, he would remain neutral.\n\nHis tenure lasted for a three-month period but saw extensive reforms made by him that were supported by an IMF standby arrangement and significant World Bank lending. He initiated a process of \"payment culture\" that targeted the tax evaders and loan defaulters. He also ordered the publication of the list of taxpayers that showed that the country had a small tax base and only a few paid taxes. He devaluated the national currency and increased the prices on food and common items. He also inaugurated the National Library and highlighted its importance in the political culture of the country. Qureshi passed the decree that made the State bank of Pakistan an autonomous body with a view to keep the bank's business operations free from political interference. He downsized the administrative machinery, and abolished the discretionary powers of the Prime Minister and the Chief Ministers which allowed them to a lot residential flats and plots to their \"favorites\".\n\nThe state television, PTV, and Radio Pakistan were made independent and were given the opportunity to air elections freely and impartially. It goes to his credit that he undertook various endeavors in such a short period of time and made a serious effort to recover Government dues.\n\nDespite his attempts to harmonize the economy, Qureshi's main task was to hold nationwide general elections in 1993 to make way for an elected government to form the government. In 1993, he oversaw the general elections held that year that witnessed the return of the Pakistan Peoples Party led by Benazir Bhutto.\n\nIn 2014, Qureshi was diagnosed with the Parkinson's disease and reportedly underwent treatment for the chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) in a local hospital.\n\nOn November 23, 2016, his family announced that Qureshi had died in Washington D.C. and was ailing for a long time while undergoing treatment in a local hospital. He was suffering from a lung infection and buried in Washington D.C..\n\nAfter congratulating and witnessing Benazir Bhutto's oath administered by the Acting President Wasim Sajjad alongside the Chief Justice of Pakistan, Qureshi returned to New York, United States, in 1993 to established the private hedge fund equity, the EMP Global. Qureshi was involved in forging an affiliation with the international insurance company, American International Group (AIG), for a number of years. AIG held a minority stake in EMP and served as a sponsor of, as well as a major investor in, a number of funds bearing its name for which EMP served as Principal Adviser. EMP bought out AIG's stake and became an independent company in 2005.\n\nAfter his departure from Pakistan, Qureshi received criticism that, in his last days at the office, he made a large number of promotions and other administrative decisions in favor of his relatives. In 2014, his name was reportedly mentioned by Imran Khan when he led the Azadi March against Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif.\n\nQureshi was married to an American citizen, Lilo Elizabeth Richter, and has four children: two sons and two daughters. He enjoyed playing tennis and was reportedly a collector of classic cars and antiques. His mansion went on the market for $8 million in May 2016.\n\n"}

Taylor's highest ever average was achieved in round four of the 2010 UK Open, in which he averaged 118.66 in a 9–0 win over Kevin Painter. This stood until 2016 when Van Gerwen set a new world record of 123.40. Taylor had the World Championship record of 111.21 which he set in the 2002 event, but Van Gerwen raised it to 114.05 in 2017.

Khan began his acting career on television by playing a soldier in the Doordarshan series \"Fauji\" (1988), a role that garnered him recognition and led to starring roles in more television shows. He soon started receiving film offers and had his first release with the romantic drama \"Deewana\" (1992), in which he played a supporting part. Khan subsequently played villainous roles in the 1993 thrillers \"Baazigar\" and \"Darr\", box office successes that established his career in Bollywood. In 1995, Khan starred opposite Kajol in Aditya Chopra's romance \"Dilwale Dulhania Le Jayenge\", that became the longest running Indian film of all time. He continued to establish a reputation in romantic roles by playing opposite Madhuri Dixit in \"Dil To Pagal Hai\" (1997), and Kajol in the Karan Johar-directed \"Kuch Kuch Hota Hai\" (1998) and \"Kabhi Khushi Kabhie Gham...\" (2001).\n\nIn 1999, Khan collaborated with Aziz Mirza and Juhi Chawla to start a production company, Dreamz Unlimited, whose first release was the comedy-drama \"Phir Bhi Dil Hai Hindustani\" (2000) starring Khan and Chawla. The film was a commercial failure as was their next production, \"Aśoka\" (2001), which led critics to believe that the end of Khan's career was imminent. Khan's career prospects, however, improved in 2002 when Sanjay Leela Bhansali cast him alongside Dixit and Aishwarya Rai as a depressed lover in \"Devdas\", a period romance that garnered Khan critical acclaim. In 2004, he collaborated with his wife Gauri Khan to launch another company, Red Chillies Entertainment, whose first feature was the box office hit \"Main Hoon Na\" (2004). Khan's popularity continued to increase in the 2000s as he played the romantic lead opposite younger actresses, most notably Rani Mukerji and Preity Zinta, in several top-grossing productions, including \"Kal Ho Naa Ho\" (2003) and \"Veer-Zaara\" (2004).

With eight Filmfare Awards for Best Actor, he shares the record for the most wins in the category with Dilip Kumar. Khan has also starred in several non-fiction films that have documented his popularity, including the Nasreen Munni Kabir-directed documentary \"The Inner and Outer World of Shah Rukh Khan\" (2005).

{"id": "44735", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=44735", "title": "Sharon Tate", "text": "Sharon Tate\n\nSharon Marie Tate Polanski (January 24, 1943 – August 9, 1969) was an American actress and model. During the 1960s, she played small television roles before appearing in films and was regularly featured in fashion magazines as a model and cover girl. After receiving positive reviews for her comedic and dramatic acting performances, Tate was hailed as one of Hollywood's most promising newcomers. \n\nShe made her film debut in 1961 in \"Barabbas\" with Anthony Quinn. She was seen next in 1966 with the occult-themed \"Eye of the Devil\". Her most remembered performance was as Jennifer North in the 1967 cult classic film, \"Valley of the Dolls\", earning her a Golden Globe Award nomination. Tate's last completed film, \"12+1\", was released posthumously in 1969, with the actress receiving top billing.\n\nOn January 20, 1968, Tate married Roman Polanski, her director and co-star in 1967's \"The Fearless Vampire Killers\". On August 9, 1969, Tate and four others were murdered by members of the Manson Family in the home she shared with Polanski. At the time of her death, she was eight-and-a-half months pregnant with the couple's son.\n\nA decade after Tate's murder, the actress' mother, Doris Tate, in response to the growing cult status of the killers and the possibility of them being granted parole, organized a public campaign that resulted in amendments to the California criminal law. Tate's mother went on to say that the law would \"help transform Sharon's legacy from murder victim to a symbol of victims' rights\". A book by Tate's sister, Debra Tate, titled \"Sharon Tate: Recollection,\" was released in 2014.\n\nSharon Tate was born in Dallas, Texas, the eldest of three daughters, to Colonel Paul James Tate (1922–2005), a United States Army officer, and his wife, Doris Gwendolyn (née Willett). At six months of age, Tate won the \"Miss Tiny Tot of Dallas Pageant\", but her parents had no show business ambitions for their daughter. Paul Tate was promoted and transferred several times. By the age of 16, as a military brat, Tate had lived in six cities and reportedly found it difficult to maintain friendships. Her family described her as shy and lacking in self-confidence. As an adult, Tate commented that people would misinterpret her shyness as aloofness until they knew her better.\n\nTate attended Chief Joseph Junior High School (now Chief Joseph Middle School) from September 1955 to June 1958, and Columbia High School (now Richland High School) in Richland, Washington, from September 1958 to October 1959. She attended Irvin High School in El Paso, Texas, from late fall 1959 to April 1960; and Vicenza American High School in Vicenza, Italy, from April to June 1960. Tate graduated from Vicenza American High School in 1961.\n\nAs she matured, people commented on Tate's beauty; she began entering beauty pageants, winning the title of \"Miss Richland\" in Washington in 1959. She spoke of her ambition to study psychiatry, and also stated her intention to compete in the \"Miss Washington\" pageant in 1960; however, before she could do either, her father received orders to be stationed in Italy. With her family relocating in Verona, Tate learned that she had become a local celebrity owing to the publication of a photograph of her in a swimsuit on the cover of the military newspaper \"Stars and Stripes\". She discovered a kinship with other students at the American school she attended in nearby Vicenza, recognizing that their backgrounds and feelings of separation were similar to her own, and for the first time in her life began to form lasting friendships.\n\nTate and her friends became interested in the filming of \"Hemingway's Adventures of a Young Man\", which was being made nearby with Paul Newman, Susan Strasberg, and Richard Beymer, and obtained parts as film extras. Beymer noticed Tate in the crowd and introduced himself, and the two dated during the production of the film, with Beymer encouraging Tate to pursue a film career. In 1960, Tate was employed by the singer Pat Boone and appeared with him in an episode of the television series \"The Pat Boone Chevy Showroom\" that was filmed in Venice.\n\nLater that year, when \"Barabbas\" was being filmed near Verona, Tate was once again hired as an extra. Actor Jack Palance was impressed by her appearance and her attitude, although her role was too small to judge her talent. He arranged a screen test for her in Rome, but this did not lead to further work. Tate returned to the United States alone, saying she wanted to further her studies, but tried to find film work. After a few months, Doris Tate, who feared for her daughter's safety, suffered a nervous breakdown and her daughter was persuaded to return to Italy. \n\nThe family returned to the United States in 1962, and Tate moved to Los Angeles, where she contacted Richard Beymer's agent, Harold Gefsky. After their first meeting, Gefsky agreed to represent her, and secured work for her in television and magazine advertisements. In 1963, he introduced her to Martin Ransohoff, director of Filmways, Inc., who signed her to a seven-year contract. She was considered for the role of Billie Jo Bradley on CBS's sitcom \"Petticoat Junction\", but Ransohoff believed that she lacked confidence and the role was given to Jeannine Riley. Ransohoff gave Tate small parts in \"Mister Ed\" and \"The Beverly Hillbillies\" to help her gain experience, but was unwilling to allow her to play a more substantial role. \"Mr. Ransohoff didn't want the audience to see me till I was ready,\" Tate was quoted in a 1967 article in \"Playboy\".\n\nDuring this time, Tate met the French actor Philippe Forquet and began a relationship with him in 1963. They became engaged, but their relationship was volatile and they frequently quarreled. Career pressures drove them apart and they broke up the next year in 1964.\n\nIn 1964, she met Jay Sebring, a former sailor who had established himself as a leading hair stylist in Hollywood. Tate later said that Sebring's nature was especially gentle, but when he proposed marriage, she declined. She said she would retire from acting as soon as she married, and at that time she intended to focus on her career.\n\nIn 1964, Tate made a screen test for Sam Peckinpah opposite Steve McQueen for the film \"The Cincinnati Kid\". Ransohoff and Peckinpah agreed that Tate's timidity and lack of experience would cause her to flounder in such a large part, and she was rejected in favor of Tuesday Weld. She continued to gain experience with minor television appearances, and after she auditioned unsuccessfully for the role of Liesl in the film version of \"The Sound of Music\", Ransohoff gave Tate walk-on roles in two motion pictures in which he was the producer: \"The Americanization of Emily\" and \"The Sandpiper\". In late 1965, Ransohoff finally gave Tate her first major role in a motion picture in the film \"Eye of the Devil\", costarring David Niven, Deborah Kerr, Donald Pleasence, and David Hemmings.\nTate and Sebring traveled to London to prepare for filming, where she met the Alexandrian Wiccan High Priest and High Priestess Alex and Maxine Sanders. Meanwhile, as part of Ransohoff's promotion of Tate, he arranged the production of a short documentary called \"All Eyes on Sharon Tate\", to be released at the same time as \"Eye of the Devil\". It included an interview with \"Eye of the Devil\" director J. Lee Thompson, who expressed his initial doubts about Tate's potential with the comment, \"We even agreed that if after the first two weeks Sharon was not quite making it, we would put her back in cold storage,\" but added he soon realized Tate was \"tremendously exciting\".\n\nTate played Odile, a witch who exerts a mysterious power over a landowner, played by Niven, and his wife, played by Kerr. Although she did not have as many lines as the other actors, Tate's performance was considered crucial to the film, and she was required, more than the other cast members, to set an ethereal tone. Niven described her as a \"great discovery\", and Kerr said that with \"a reasonable amount of luck\" Tate would be a great success. In interviews, Tate commented on her good fortune in working with such professionals in her first film and said that she had learned a lot about acting simply by watching Kerr at work. Much of the filming took place in France, and Sebring returned to Los Angeles to fulfill his business obligations. After filming, Tate remained in London, where she immersed herself in the fashion world and nightclubs. Around this time, she met Roman Polanski.\n\nTate and Polanski later agreed that neither of them had been impressed by the other when they first met. Polanski was planning \"The Fearless Vampire Killers\", which was being coproduced by Ransohoff, and had decided that he wanted the red-headed actress Jill St. John for the female lead. Ransohoff insisted that Polanski cast Tate, and after meeting with her, he agreed that she would be suitable on the condition that she wore a red wig during filming.\n\nThe company traveled to Italy for filming where Tate's fluent Italian proved useful in communicating with the local crew members. A perfectionist, Polanski had little patience with the inexperienced Tate, and said in an interview that one scene had required 70 takes before he was satisfied. In addition to directing, Polanski also played one of the main characters, a guileless young man who is intrigued by Tate's character and begins a romance with her.\n\nAs filming progressed, Polanski praised her performances and her confidence grew. They began a relationship, and Tate moved into Polanski's London apartment after filming ended. Jay Sebring traveled to London, where he insisted on meeting Polanski. Although friends later said he was devastated, he befriended Polanski and remained Tate's closest confidante. Polanski later commented that Sebring was a lonely and isolated person, who viewed Tate and himself as his family.\n\nTate returned to the United States to film \"Don't Make Waves\" with Tony Curtis, leaving Polanski in London. Tate played the role of Malibu and the film was intended to capitalize on the popularity of beach movies and the music of such artists as the Beach Boys and Jan and Dean. Tate's character, billed by Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer publicity as \"Malibu, Queen of the Surf\", wore little more than a bikini for most of the film. Disappointed with the film, she began referring to herself sarcastically as \"sexy little me\". Before the film's release, a major publishing campaign Coppertone sunsscreen featured Tate. The film opened to poor reviews and mediocre ticket sales, and Tate was quoted as confiding to a reporter, \"It's a terrible movie\", before adding, \"Sometimes I say things I shouldn't. I guess I'm too outspoken.\"\n\nPolanski returned to the United States, and was contracted by the head of Paramount Pictures, Robert Evans, to direct and write the screenplay for \"Rosemary's Baby\", which was based on Ira Levin's novel of the same name. Polanski later admitted that he had wanted Tate to star in the film and had hoped that someone would suggest her, as he felt it inappropriate to make the suggestion himself. The producers did not suggest Tate, and Mia Farrow was cast. Tate reportedly provided ideas for some of the key scenes, including the scene in which the protagonist, Rosemary, is impregnated. A frequent visitor to the set, she was photographed there by \"Esquire\" and the resulting photographs generated considerable publicity for both Tate and the film.\n\nA March 1967 article about Tate in \"Playboy\" began, \"This is the year that Sharon Tate happens ...\" and included six nude or partially nude photographs taken by Roman Polanski during filming of \"The Fearless Vampire Killers\". Tate was optimistic: \"Eye of the Devil\" and \"The Fearless Vampire Killers\" were each due for release, and she had been signed to play a major role in the film version of \"Valley of the Dolls\". One of the all-time bestsellers, the film version was highly publicized and anticipated, and while Tate acknowledged that such a prominent role should further her career, she confided to Polanski that she did not like either the book or the script.\n\nPatty Duke, Barbara Parkins, and Judy Garland were cast as the other leads. Susan Hayward replaced Garland a few weeks later when she was dismissed. Director Mark Robson was highly critical of the three principal actresses, but according to Duke, directed most of his criticism at Tate. Duke later said Robson \"continually treated [Tate] like an imbecile, which she definitely was not, and she was very attuned and sensitive to this treatment\". Polanski later quoted Robson as saying to him, \"That's a great girl you're living with. Few actresses have her kind of vulnerability. She's got a great future.\"\n\nIn interviews during production, Tate expressed an affinity for her character, Jennifer North, an aspiring actress admired only for her body. Some magazines commented that Tate was viewed similarly and \"Look\" published an unfavorable article about the three lead actresses, describing Tate as \"a hopelessly stupid and vain starlet\". Tate, Duke, and Parkins developed a close friendship that continued after the completion of the film. During the shooting of \"Valley of the Dolls\", Tate confided to Parkins that she was \"madly in love\" with Polanski. \"Yes, there's no doubt that Roman is the man in my life,\" Tate was quoted as saying in the New York \"Sunday News\". Tate promoted the film enthusiastically. She frequently commented on her admiration for Lee Grant, with whom she had played several dramatic scenes. Tate was quoted as saying, \"I learned a great deal about acting in [\"Valley of the Dolls\"], particularly in my scenes with Lee Grant... She knows what acting is all about and everything she does, from little mannerisms to delivering her lines, is pure professionalism.\"\n\nA journalist asked Tate to comment on her nude scene, and she replied,\n\nI have no qualms about it at all. I don't see any difference between being stark naked or fully dressed — if it's part of the job and it's done with meaning and intention. I honestly don't understand the big fuss made over nudity and sex in films. It's silly. On TV, the children can watch people murdering each other, which is a very unnatural thing, but they can't watch two people in the very natural process of making love. Now, really, that doesn't make any sense, does it?\n\nAn edited version of \"The Fearless Vampire Killers\" was released, and Polanski expressed disgust at Ransohoff for \"butchering\" his film. \"Newsweek\" called it \"a witless travesty\", and it was not profitable. Tate's performance was largely ignored in reviews, and when she was mentioned, it was usually in relation to her nude scenes. \"Eye of the Devil\" was released shortly after, and Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer attempted to build interest in Tate with its press release describing her as \"one of the screen's most exciting new personalities\". The film failed to find an audience, and most reviews were indifferent, neither praising nor condemning it. \"The New York Times\" wrote that one of the few highlights was Tate's \"chillingly beautiful but expressionless performance\".\n\nThe \"All Eyes on Sharon Tate\" documentary was used to publicize the film. Its 14 minutes consisted of a number of scenes depicting Tate filming \"Eye of the Devil\", dancing in nightclubs, and sightseeing around London, and also contained a brief interview with her. Asked about her acting ambitions, she replied, \"I don't fool myself. I can't see myself doing Shakespeare.\" She spoke of her hopes of finding a niche in comedy, and in other interviews she expressed her desire to become \"a light comedienne in the Carole Lombard style\". She discussed the type of contemporary actress she wanted to emulate and explained that there were two in particular that she was influenced by: Faye Dunaway and Catherine Deneuve. Of the latter, she said, \"I'd like to be an American Catherine Deneuve. She plays beautiful, sensitive, deep parts with a little bit of intelligence behind them.\"\n\nLater in the year, \"Valley of the Dolls\" opened to almost uniformly negative reviews. Bosley Crowther wrote in \"The New York Times\", \"all a fairly respectful admirer of movies can do is laugh at it and turn away\". \"Newsweek\" said that the film \"has no more sense of its own ludicrousness than a village idiot stumbling in manure\", but a later article read: \"Astoundingly photogenic, infinitely curvaceous, Sharon Tate is one of the most smashing young things to hit Hollywood in a long time.\" The three lead actresses were castigated in numerous publications, including \"The Saturday Review\", which wrote, \"Ten years ago ... Parkins, Duke, and Tate would more likely have been playing the hat check girls than movie-queens; they are totally lacking in style, authority, or charm.\" \"The Hollywood Reporter\" provided some positive comments, such as, \"Sharon Tate emerges as the film's most sympathetic character ... William H. Daniels' photographic caress of her faultless face and enormous absorbent eyes is stunning.\" Roger Ebert of the \"Chicago Sun-Times\" praised Tate as \"a wonder to behold\", but after describing the dialogue in one scene as \"the most offensive and appalling vulgarity ever thrown up by any civilization\", concluded that, \"I will be unable to take her any more seriously as a sex symbol than Raquel Welch.\"\n\nIn late 1967, Tate and Polanski returned to London and were frequent subjects of newspaper and magazine articles. Tate was depicted as being untraditional and modern, and was quoted as saying couples should live together before marrying. They were married in Chelsea, London, on January 20, 1968, with considerable publicity. Polanski was dressed in what the press described as \"Edwardian finery\", while Tate was attired in a white minidress. The couple moved into Polanski's mews house off Eaton Square in Belgravia, London. Photographer Peter Evans later described them as \"the imperfect couple. They were the Douglas Fairbanks/Mary Pickford of our time ... Cool, nomadic, talented, and nicely shocking.\"\n\nWhile Tate reportedly wanted a traditional marriage, Polanski remained somewhat promiscuous and described Tate's attitude to his infidelity as \"Sharon's big hang-up\". He reminded Tate that she had promised that she would not try to change him. Tate accepted Polanski's conditions, though she confided to friends that she hoped he would change. Peter Evans quoted Tate as saying, \"We have a good arrangement. Roman lies to me and I pretend to believe him.\"\n\nPolanski urged Tate to end her association with Martin Ransohoff, and Tate began to place less importance on her career until Polanski told her he wanted to be married to \"a hippie, not a housewife.\" The couple returned to Los Angeles and quickly became part of a social group that included some of the most successful young people in the film industry, including Warren Beatty, Jacqueline Bisset, Leslie Caron, Joan Collins, Mia Farrow, Jane Fonda, Peter Fonda, Laurence Harvey, Steve McQueen, Joanna Pettet and Peter Sellers; older film stars like Yul Brynner, Kirk Douglas, Henry Fonda and Danny Kaye; musicians such as Jim Morrison and The Mamas & the Papas; and record producer Terry Melcher and his girlfriend, actress Candice Bergen. Jay Sebring remained one of the couple's more frequent companions. Polanski's circle of friends included people he had known since his youth in Poland such as Wojciech Frykowski and Frykowski's girlfriend, coffee heiress Abigail Folger. Tate and Polanski moved into the Chateau Marmont Hotel in Los Angeles for a few months until they arranged to lease Patty Duke's home on Summit Ridge Drive in Beverly Hills during the latter part of 1968. The Polanski house was often full of strangers, and Tate regarded the casual atmosphere as part of the \"free spirit\" of the times, saying that she did not mind who came into her home as her motto was \"live and let live.\" Her close friend Leslie Caron later commented that the Polanskis were too trusting — \"to the point of recklessness\" — and that she had been alarmed by it.\n\nIn the summer of 1968, Tate began \"The Wrecking Crew\" (1969), a comedy in which she played Freya Carlson, an accident-prone spy, who was also a romantic interest for star Dean Martin, playing Matt Helm. She performed her own stunts and was taught martial arts by Bruce Lee. The film was successful and brought Tate strong reviews, with many reviewers praising her comedic performance. \"The New York Times\" critic Vincent Canby criticized the film, but wrote, \"The only nice thing is Sharon Tate, a tall, really great-looking girl.\" Martin commented that he intended to make another \"Matt Helm\" film and that he wanted Tate to reprise her role.\n\nAround this time Tate was feted as a promising newcomer. She was nominated for a Golden Globe Award as \"New Star of the Year – Actress\" for her performance in \"Valley of the Dolls\".\n\nShe placed fourth behind Mia Farrow, Judy Geeson and Katharine Houghton for a \"Golden Laurel\" award as the year's \"Most Promising Newcomer\" with the results published in the \"Motion Picture Exhibitor\" magazine. She was also runner-up to Lynn Redgrave in the \"Motion Picture Herald\"s poll for \"The Star of Tomorrow,\" in which box-office drawing power was the main criterion for inclusion on the list. These results indicated that her career was beginning to accelerate, and for her next film, Tate negotiated a fee of $150,000.\n\nShe became pregnant near the end of 1968, and on February 15, 1969, she and Polanski moved to 10050 Cielo Drive in Benedict Canyon. The house previously had been occupied by their friends Terry Melcher and Candice Bergen. Tate and Polanski had visited it several times, and Tate was thrilled to learn it was available, referring to it as her \"love house.\" At their new home, the Polanskis continued to be popular hosts for their large group of friends, although some of their friends still worried about the strange types who continued to show up at their parties. Encouraged by positive reviews of her comedic performances, Tate chose the comedy \"Twelve Plus One\" (1969) as her next project, as she later explained, largely for the opportunity to co-star with Orson Welles. In March 1969, she traveled to Italy to begin filming, and Polanski went to London to work on \"The Day of the Dolphin\" (1973). Frykowski and Folger moved into the Cielo Drive house.\n\nAfter completing \"Twelve Plus One\", Tate joined Polanski in London. She posed in their apartment for photographer Terry O'Neill in casual domestic scenes such as opening baby gifts, and completed a series of glamour photographs for the British magazine \"Queen\". A journalist asked Tate in a late July interview if she believed in fate, to which she replied, \"Certainly. My whole life has been decided by fate. I think something more powerful than we are decides our fates for us. I know one thing — I've never planned anything that ever happened to me.\"\n\nShe returned from London to Los Angeles on July 20, 1969, traveling alone on the \"QE2\". Polanski was due to return on August 12 in time for the birth, and he had asked Frykowski and Folger to stay in the house with Tate until his return.\n\nOn August 8, 1969, Tate was two weeks from giving birth. She entertained two friends, actress Joanna Pettet and singer Barbara Lewis, for lunch at her home, confiding in them her disappointment at Polanski's delay in returning from London. That afternoon, Polanski telephoned her as did her younger sister, Debra, who called to ask if she and their sister, Patti, could spend the night with her. Tate declined, offering to have them over another time. Later that evening, Tate dined at her favorite restaurant, El Coyote Cafe, with Jay Sebring, Wojciech Frykowski, and Abigail Folger, returning at about 10:30 p.m.\n\nShortly after midnight, they were murdered by members of Charles Manson's \"family\" and their bodies were discovered the following morning by Tate's housekeeper, Winifred Chapman. Police arrived at the scene to find the body of a young man, later identified as Steven Parent, shot dead in his car, which was in the driveway. Inside the house, the bodies of Tate and Sebring were found in the living room; a long rope tied around each of their necks connected them. On the front lawn lay the bodies of Frykowski and Folger. All of the victims, except Parent, had been stabbed numerous times. The coroner's report for Tate noted that she had been stabbed sixteen times, and that \"five of the wounds were in and of themselves fatal\".\n\nPolice took the only survivor at the address, the property's caretaker William Garretson, in for questioning. Garretson lived in the guest house that was located on the property, but a short distance from the house, and not immediately visible. As the first suspect, Garretson was questioned and submitted to a polygraph test. Garretson stated that Parent had visited him at approximately 11:30 p.m. and left shortly thereafter. Garretson informed police that he had no involvement in the murders and did not know anything that could help the investigation. Police accepted his explanation and he was released.\nPolanski was informed of the murders and returned to Los Angeles where police, unable to determine a motive, questioned him about his wife and friends. On Wednesday, August 13, Tate was interred in the Holy Cross Cemetery, Culver City, California, with her son, Paul Richard Polanski (named posthumously for Polanski's and Tate's fathers), in her arms. Sebring's funeral took place later the same day; the funerals were scheduled several hours apart to allow mutual friends to attend.\n\n\"Life\" magazine devoted a lengthy article to the murders and featured photographs of the crime scenes. Polanski was interviewed for the article and allowed himself to be photographed at the entrance of the house, next to the front door with the word \"PIG\"—written in Tate's blood—still visible. Widely criticized for his actions, he argued that he wanted to know who was responsible and was willing to shock the magazine's readers in the hope that someone would come forward with information.\n\nCuriosity about the victims led to the re-release of Tate's films, achieving greater popularity than they had in their initial runs. Some newspapers began to speculate about the motives for the murders. Some of the published photographs of Tate were allegedly taken at a Satanic ritual, but were later proven to have been production photographs from \"Eye of the Devil\". Friends spoke out against the portrayal of Tate by some elements of the media. Mia Farrow said she was as \"sweet and pure a human being as I have ever known\", while Patty Duke remembered her as \"a gentle, gentle creature. I was crazy about her, and I don't know anyone who wasn't.\" Polanski berated a crowd of journalists at a news conference, saying that many times they had written that Tate \"was beautiful. Maybe the most beautiful woman in the world. But did you ever write how good she was?\" Peter Evans later quoted the actor Laurence Harvey, who commented on Polanski immediately after the murders, \"This could destroy Roman. Marriage vows mean nothing to him, but few men have adored a woman as much as he adored Sharon.\"\n\nPolanski later stated that, in the months following the murders, he suspected various friends and associates, and his paranoia subsided only when the killers were arrested. Newspapers claimed that many Hollywood stars were moving out of the city, while others were reported to have installed security systems in their homes. Writer Dominick Dunne later recalled the tension:The shock waves that went through the town were beyond anything I had ever seen before. People were convinced that the rich and famous of the community were in peril. Children were sent out of town. Guards were hired. Steve McQueen packed a gun when he went to Jay Sebring's funeral.\n\nIn September 1969, members of the Manson \"Family\" were arrested on unrelated charges, eventually leading authorities to a breakthrough on the Tate case as well. They explained that the motive for the murders was not the identity of the victims, but rather the house at that address, which had previously been rented to record producer Terry Melcher, an acquaintance of Manson.\n\nIn 1994, the Tate-Polanski house was demolished and a new house was constructed on the site with the street address changed to 10066 Cielo Drive.\n\nIn the early 1980s, Stephen Kay, who had worked for the prosecution in the trial, became alarmed that Manson Family member Leslie Van Houten had gathered 900 signatures on a petition for her parole. He contacted Tate's mother, Doris, who said she was sure she could do better, and the two mounted a publicity campaign, collecting over 350,000 signatures supporting the denial of parole. Van Houten had been seen as the most likely of the killers to be paroled; following Kay's and Tate's efforts, her petition was denied. Doris Tate became a vocal advocate for victims' rights and, in discussing her daughter's murder and meeting other crime victims, assumed the role of counselor, using her profile to encourage public discussion and criticism of the corrections system.\n\nFor the rest of her life, she strongly campaigned against the parole of each of the Manson killers, and worked closely with other victims of violent crime. Several times, she confronted Charles Manson at parole hearings, explaining, \"I feel that Sharon has to be represented in that hearing room. If they're (the killers) pleading for their lives, then I have to be there representing her.\" She addressed Tex Watson directly during her victim impact statement in 1984: \"What mercy, sir, did you show my daughter when she was begging for her life? What mercy did you show my daughter when she said, 'Give me two weeks to have my baby and then you can kill me'? ... When will Sharon come up for parole? Will these seven victims and possibly more walk out of their graves if you get paroled? You cannot be trusted.\"\n\nIn 1992, President George Bush recognized Doris Tate as one of his \"thousand points of light\" for her volunteer work on behalf of victims' rights. By this time Tate had been diagnosed with a malignant brain tumor and her health and strength were failing; her meeting with Bush marked her final public appearance. When she died later that year, her youngest daughter, Patricia Gay Tate, known as Patti, continued her work. She contributed to the 1993 foundation of the Doris Tate Crime Victims Bureau, a nonprofit organization that aims to influence crime legislation throughout the United States and to give greater rights and protection to victims of violent crime. In 1995, the Doris Tate Crime Victims Foundation was founded as a nonprofit organization to promote public awareness of the judicial system and to provide support to the victims of violent crime.\n\nPatti Tate confronted David Geffen and board members of Geffen Records in 1993 over plans to include a song written by Charles Manson on the Guns N' Roses album \"\"The Spaghetti Incident?\"\". She commented to a journalist that the record company was \"putting Manson up on a pedestal for young people who don't know who he is to worship like an idol.\"\n\nAfter Patti's death from breast cancer in 2000, her older sister Debra continued to represent the Tate family at parole hearings. Debra Tate said of the killers: \"They don't show any personal responsibility. They haven't made atonement to any one of my family members.\" She has also unsuccessfully lobbied for her sister to be awarded a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame.\n\nColonel Paul Tate preferred not to make public comments; however, he was a constant presence during the murder trial, and in the following years attended parole hearings with his wife, and wrote letters to authorities in which he strongly opposed any suggestion of parole. He died in May 2005.\n\nRoman Polanski gave away all of his possessions after the murders, unable to bear any reminders of the period that he called \"the happiest I ever was in my life.\" He remained in Los Angeles until the killers were arrested. After, he fled to Europe to evade criminal charges of raping a 13-year-old girl. His 1979 film \"Tess\" was dedicated \"to Sharon\", as Tate had read Thomas Hardy's \"Tess of the d'Urbervilles\" during her final stay with Polanski in London and had left it for him to read with the comment that it would be a good story for them to film together. He tried to explain his anguish after the murder of his wife and unborn son in his 1984 autobiography \"Roman by Polanski\", saying \"Since Sharon's death, and despite appearances to the contrary, my enjoyment of life has been incomplete. In moments of unbearable personal tragedy some people find solace in religion. In my case the opposite happened. Any religious faith I had was shattered by Sharon's murder. It reinforced my faith in the absurd.\"\n\nIn July 2005, Polanski successfully sued \"Vanity Fair\" magazine for libel after it alleged that he had tried to seduce a woman on his way to Tate's funeral. Among the witnesses who testified on his behalf were Debra Tate and Mia Farrow. Describing Polanski immediately after Tate's death, Farrow testified, \"Of this I can be sure—of his frame of mind when we were there, of what we talked about, of his utter sense of loss, of despair and bewilderment and shock and love—a love that he had lost.\" At the conclusion of the case, Polanski read a statement, saying in part, \"The memory of my late wife Sharon Tate was at the forefront of my mind in bringing this action.\"\n\nThe murders committed by the Manson \"Family\" have been described by social commentators as one of the defining moments of the 1960s. Joan Didion wrote, \"Many people I know in Los Angeles believe that the Sixties ended abruptly on August 9, 1969, ended at the exact moment when word of the murders on Cielo Drive traveled like brushfire through the community, and in a sense this is true. The tension broke that day. The paranoia was fulfilled.\"\n\nTate's work as an actress has been reassessed after her death, with contemporary film writers and critics, such as Leonard Maltin, describing her potential as a comedian. A restored version of \"The Fearless Vampire Killers\" more closely resembles Polanski's intention. Maltin lauded the film as \"near-brilliant\" and Tate's work in \"Don't Make Waves\" and \"The Wrecking Crew\" as her two best performances, as well as the best indicators of the career she might have established. \"Eye of the Devil\" with its supernatural themes, and \"Valley of the Dolls\", with its overstated melodrama, have each achieved a degree of cult status.\n\nTate's biographer, Greg King, holds a view often expressed by members of the Tate family, writing in \"Sharon Tate and the Manson Murders\" (2000): \"Sharon's real legacy lies not in her movies or in her television work. The very fact that, today, victims or their families in California are able to sit before those convicted of a crime and have a voice in the sentencing at trials or at parole hearings, is largely due to the work of Doris [and Patti] Tate. Their years of devotion to Sharon's memory and dedication to victims' rights ... have helped transform Sharon from mere victim, [and] restore a human face to one of the twentieth century's most infamous crimes.\"\n\nIn 2012, the book \"Restless Souls\" was published. Authored by Alisa Statman, a close friend of Patti Tate, two short chapters in the book are written by Sharon's niece, Brie Taylor Ford, daughter of the late Patti Tate Ford. The book contains portions of the unfinished autobiographies of Sharon's father, mother and sister, Patti, along with Statman's own \"personal interpretation[s].\" Debra Tate has questioned the book's veracity.\n\nOn June 10, 2014, a coffee table book by Debra Tate, called \"Sharon Tate: Recollection\", was released. It is the first book about Tate that is devoted exclusively to her life and career without covering her death, its aftermath, or the events that led to it.\n\nin 2009, American contemporary artist Jeremy Kenyon Lockyer Corbell presented a comprehensive mixed media art exhibition \"ICON: Life Love & Style of Sharon Tate\": In honor of the 40th anniversary of Tate's passing. With the blessing of the Tate family, Corbell created a 350-piece historic art exhibition celebrating Tate's style and life. The art and fashion based presentation showcased images of Tate's never-before-revealed wardrobe by designers such as Christian Dior, Thea Porter, Ossie Clark, and Yves Saint Laurent. Sharon was also mentioned in Jim Carrol's song \"it's too late\".\n\nTate was portrayed by actress Katie Cassidy in the 2016 horror film \"Wolves at the Door\", loosely based on the Manson Family's murders. In 2017 Rachel Roberts portrayed Sharon in the seventh season of \"\". Kate Bosworth is set to play Tate in the upcoming Screen Gems biopic \"Tate\", which will be directed by Michael Polish. Margot Robbie will also portray Tate in the 2019 film \"Once Upon a Time in Hollywood\" directed by Quentin Tarantino, which will be based on the Manson murders. In 2018, film director Daniel Farrands was confirmed to be working on an adaptation titled \"The Haunting of Sharon Tate\", with Hilary Duff playing the titular character.\n\nNotes\nBibliography\n\n"}

He set up the first HIV/AIDS telephone hotline in China where people could obtain comprehensive information on HIV/AIDS.\n\nAfter this, he focused much of his AIDS work on advocating for health care and human rights of people with AIDS living in Henan Province, where there was a coverup of blood selling businesses connected to local officials infected tens of thousands (as many as a million) men, women, and children with the AIDS virus. He expanded his work to advocate for the health of injection drug users, sex workers, and other marginalized groups disproportionately affected by the AIDS epidemic. He was co-founder of the Beijing LGBT Center, the first gay community center in China. His \"frank and aggressive\" approach toward AIDS has led to frequent run-ins with authorities and landed him in detention three times in the past 12 years, including a month-long detention in 2002 that made international headlines and sparked a successful international campaign for his release. \n\nDr. Wan has won numerous human rights awards, is a former Fulbright Fellow and Yale University Global Fellow, and signed China's groundbreaking Charter 08 on human rights, of which Nobel Laureate and Wan's friend Liu Xiaobo is the first signatory. Dr. Wan is currently the director of the country's foremost AIDS-awareness group, the Beijing-based Aizhixing Institute of Health Education. (The Chinese characters for \"Aizhixing\" (愛知行) represent love, knowledge and action and are a play on the Chinese word for AIDS.) \n\nOn 24 August 2002 he disappeared and was later found to be detained by police after attending a film screening at a Beijing gay and lesbian film festival and charged with the leaking of an internal government report into the Bloodhead scandal in Henan Province. He was released a month later on 20 September.\n\nFrom 6 to 9 November 2006, he attended an international meeting in Indonesia for The Yogyakarta Principles as one of 29 experts. After the meeting he has gotten his most recent detention on November 24, 2006 - this time a three-day detention prompted by his efforts to organize a public forum on HIV/AIDS to coincide with World AIDS Day. After his release on November 27, 2006, Wan accused Chinese leaders of falling \"asleep\" as the virus spreads. He was also forced by the government to cancel his \"Blood Safety, AIDS and Legal Human Rights Workshop\" (due to have taken place between 25–30 November 2006).\n\nAs the Charter 08 by Liu Xiaobo was published on 10 December 2008, he agreed it and became one of the signatories. In July 2009, he also participated the 2009 World Outgames for LGBT rights.\n\nOn May 10, 2010, Wan Yanhai together with his family fled to the United States of America because of what he considered to be government persecution. In March, tax authorities opened an investigation into the Aizhixing Institute of Health Education. \n\nHowever, in 2011 tax authorities admitted that they had made an error and returned some 8,000 RMB to Aizhixing Institute.\n"}
