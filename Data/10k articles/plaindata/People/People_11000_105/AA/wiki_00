By 1942 he fled to Romania and after the end of the Second World War he was sentenced by the Special Traitor's Courts in Greece to death. In Romania jailed by the new Communist government and he died there in 1948.\n\nAlcibiades Diamandi was born in 1894, in Samarina, into a wealthy Aromanian (Vlach) family. He studied at the Greek Gymnasium in Siatista, continuing his studies in Romania where he became involved in the Aromanian separatist movement. During the course of World War I he served as a non-commissioned officer in the Greek army. In 1917, he formed an armed Aromanian separatist band that operated in the Pindus mountains, then part of the Italian protectorate over Albania. With the tacit approval of the Italian authorities he proclaimed the foundation of the Principality of the Pindus centered in Samarina, with himself as prince. Following a diplomatic protest by Greece, Italian troops departed from Epirus as did Diamandi who was charged with sedition. Returning to Romania in the early 1920s he entered the Romanian diplomatic service and was appointed consul at Sarandë in order to influence the local Vlach population. It is believed that in 1925 he became an agent of the Italian intelligence services. Diamandi's involvement in illegal economic activities led to his removal from the Romanian diplomatic corp. In 1927, Diamandi received a pardon from the Greek government.\n\nShortly after the presumed amnesty, he arrived in Athens as the \"vice president of the National Petroleum Company of Romania\", as an oil importer. This was coupled with importing lumber from Romania to Greece and some other business ventures. He rented a flat in the fashionable Kolonaki district, and frequented the bars and cafes of Piraeus, where he was involved in a brawl with a Greek navy captain. During the squabble, Diamandi was wounded by a bottle flung in his direction by his adversary, and the resulting scar was used to identify him later on when he was on the run.\n\nDiamandi frequently traveled to Rhodes (which was at the time an Italian possession), managing to attract the attention of the Greek Counter-intelligence Services. It is widely assumed that the Greek government was aware that Diamandi was an undercover Romanian agent who was trying to incite the Aromanians against the Greek state. During Ioannis Metaxas's regime, Diamandi was served with an expulsion order, but he managed to avoid being forced out and continued his activities.\n\nWhen the Greco-Italian War started, at the end of October 1940, Diamandi was already in Konitsa on the Albanian-Greek border. The invading Italians offered him the rank of \"Commendatore\", and he served as translator and assistant to the Italian Chief of Staff General Alfredo Guzzoni. After Italy's initial defeat, Diamandi was forced to seek refuge in Tirana (at that time under Italian rule) and re-entered Greece with the Italian armies five months later in the spring of 1941.\n\nThis time he discussed a so-called \"Autonomous State of the Pindus\" (\"Αυτόνομον Κράτος της Πίνδου\") or \"Autonomous Vlach State\" (\"Αυτόνομον Βλαχικόν Κράτος\") in the territory of Epirus, Thessaly and parts of Macedonia, which was supposed to constitute a \"Vlach Homeland\". This planned state or canton is sometimes called \"Principality of Pindus\" (the name used to mainly refer to the events in Pindus in August 1917). Diamandi's deputy and right-hand was the Larissa-based lawyer Nicolaos Matussis, while the third in the hierarchy of the nascent state was Rapoutikas Vassilis.\n\nIn June 1941, Diamandi found himself in Grevena and then he went to Metsovo, where he founded the \"Party of the Kοutso-Vlach Community\" (\"Κόμμα Κοινότητας Κουτσοβλάχων\") which was part of the \"Union of Romanian Communities\" (\"Ένωσις Ρουμανικών Κοινοτήτων\"). A \"Vlach Parliament\" was summoned in Trikala, but no laws were adopted—since the meeting was mostly for show; the Italians were not keen on sharing power in the region.\n\nOn March 1, 1942, Diamandi issued an ample \"Manifesto\" which was published in the local press and republished by Stavros Anthemides in 1997 (in his book on the \"Vlachs of Greece\"; see bibliography). The \"Manifesto\" was co-signed by leading Aromanians (Vlachs) intellectuals such as:\n\nTwo Vlachs of Albania and Bulgaria, Vasilis Vartolis and the Samarina born writer Zicu Araia, also endorsed the \"Manifesto\". In Romania, it was co-signed by the Veria-born George Murnu, a professor at the University of Bucharest. Diamandi travelled to Bucharest shortly after he met Murnu, and together they attended a meeting with the then Leader (\"Conducător\") of Romania Marshal Ion Antonescu, and the Foreign Minister Mihai Antonescu. The status of the Principality of Pindos was discussed.\n\nOne option favoured by Diamandi was to put the Principality under the sovereignty of the Romanian Crown (as an associated \"free state\"). Another option was to link the principality to the ruling Italian House of Savoy. None of these options was to be realised.\n\nTowards the second year of the Italian occupation, guerilla actions broke out in the area, between the supported by the Allied Forces and the Italo-German side. The chaos that ensued drove Diamandi to leave (either that or he was ordered back) to Romania. Diamandi was arrested by the Romanian Communist Secret Service ”Securitate” on February 21, 1948. He died in the Prefecture of Police in Bucharest some months later supposedly under torture by Soviet Agent Mihail Dulgheru.\n\nMatoussi escaped, first to Athens then to Romania too, while Rapoutikas was shot dead by one of the Greek factions involved in guerilla activities just outside Larissa (the Greeks then tied his corpse on the back a donkey and paraded him through the Vlach villages of the Pindus - this was intended in order to scare the local populace and as a final proof that the so-called Roman Legion had reached its end).\n\nThere are many gaps in the biography of the secretive Prince Diamandi, and he is scarcely mentioned in most of the few books that deal with the period. According to the German scholar Dr. Thede Kahl (see bibliography), Diamandi was for a while Kingdom of Romania's Consul in the Albanian port Vlorë just opposite across the strait of the Italian town of Otranto. The Greek historians usually avoid mentioning him altogether, while other scholars who give vague reference to him (such as or Mark Mazower) make sure that they clearly distance themselves from Diamandi hence bestowing upon him apelatives like \"extremist\" and \"shameful\", failing to bring to the surface new data or impartial information as to the personality of Diamandi.\n\nAlkiviadis Diamandi is given mention in 1995 by the British author Tim Salmon in his book about the Vlachs of Greece (see bibliography) as follows:\nThe author finds the precedents of Diamandi's movement in the Vlachs' desire of separateness, which he sees as a sign of \"strength\". Other passages of his book emphasize this aspect as well.\n\nHe writes:\n\n"}

{"id": "602580", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=602580", "title": "Avars (Caucasus)", "text": "Avars (Caucasus)\n\nThe Avars (, \"awaral / maⱨarulal\"; \"mountaineers\") are a Northeast Caucasian native ethnic group who are the predominant of several ethnic groups living in the Russian republic of Dagestan. The Avars reside in a region known as the North Caucasus between the Black and Caspian Seas. Alongside other ethnic groups in the North Caucasus region, the Caucasian Avars live in ancient villages located approximately 2,000 m above sea level. The Avar language spoken by the Caucasian Avars belongs to the family of Northeast Caucasian languages and is also known as Nakh–Dagestanian. Islam has been the prevailing religion of the Avars since the 13th century.\n\nAccording to 19th-century Russian historians, Avarians' neighbors usually referred to them by the exonyms ' Tavlins (\"tavlintsy\"). Vasily Potto wrote that those to the south usually knew them as Tavlins (\"tavlintsy\"). \"The words in different languages have the same meaning ... [of] mountain dwellers [or] highlanders\".\n\nNikolai Dubrovin wrote: \"Chechnya, with its rich mountain pastures, mountain slopes covered with dense forest, with its plain, irrigated by many rivers and rich vegetation, is a perfect contrast to the neighbouring barren and rocky parts of Dagestan populated by an Avarian tribe\". \n\nThe name Tavlin is believed to be from the Turkic \"tau\", meaning \"mountain\". Those known as Tavlins usually have origins in the upper parts of two tributaries of the Sulak River: the Andiyskoe Koisu and Avarskoye Koisu.\n\nPotto also claimed that members of Avarian tribe also often referred to themselves by the alternate endonym \"maarulal\", also meaning \"mountaineer\".\n\nAccording to the historian Sergey Tolstov, Avarians originated in Khurasan, south-east of the Caspian Sea, and migrated to the Caucasus. These geographical origins apparently link them to the Hurrians of Subartu. \n\nThe earliest mention of the Avars in European history is by Priscus, who reported in 463 AD that a combined legation from the Saragurs, Urogs and Unogurs had requested an alliance with Byzantium. The legation claimed that in 461 their peoples had been displaced by the Sabirs, as a result of pressure from the Avars.\n\nIt is not clear whether or in what way the Caucasian Avarians are related to the early \"Pseudo-Avars\" (or Pannonian Avars) of the Dark Ages, but it is known that with the mediation of Sarosius in 567, the Göktürks requested Byzantium to distinguish the Avars of Pannonia as \"Pseudo-Avars\" as opposed to the true Avars of the east, who had come under Göktürk hegemony. The modern \"Arab Encyclopaedia\" states that the Magyars originated in this area.\n\nThe Avar invasion of the Caucasus resulted in the establishment of an Avar ruling dynasty in Sarir, a medieval Christian state in the Dagestani highlands.\n\nDuring the Khazar wars against the Caliphate in the 7th century, the Avars sided with Khazaria. Surakat is mentioned as their Khagan around 729–30 AD, followed by Andunik-Nutsal at the time of Abu Muslima, then Dugry-Nutsal. Sarir suffered a partial eclipse after the Arabs gained the upper hand, but managed to reassert its influence in the region in the 9th century. It confronted the weakened Khazars and conducted a friendly policy towards the neighbouring Christian states of Georgia and Alania.\n\nIn the early 12th century, Sarir disintegrated, to be succeeded by the Avar Khanate, a predominantly Muslim polity. The only extant monument of Sarir architecture is a 10th-century church at the village of Datuna. The Mongol invasions seem not to have affected the Avar territory, and the alliance with the Golden Horde enabled the Avar khans to increase their prosperity. In the 15th century the Horde declined, and the Shamkhalate of Kazi-Kumukh rose to power. The Avars could not compete with it and were incorporated by them.\n\nFrom the 16th century onwards, the Persians and Ottomans started consolidating their authority over the entire Caucasus, and divided and consolidated most of its territory for themselves. By the mid-16th century, what is now Eastern Georgia, Dagestan, nowadays Azerbaijan, and Armenia was under Safavid Persian rule, while what is now Western Georgia fell under Ottoman Turkish suzerainty. Although Dagestan was once briefly gained by the Ottoman Turks through the Ottoman-Safavid War of 1578–1590, Dagestan and many of its Avar inhabitants stayed under Persian suzerainty for many centuries. However, many ethnic groups in Dagestan, including many Avars, retained relatively high amounts of freedom and self-rule. After losing the Caucasus briefly in the early 18th century, following the disintegration of the Safavids and the Russo-Persian War of 1722–1723, the Persians reestablished full control over the Caucasus again in the early 18th century under Nader Shah through his Caucasian campaign and Dagestan campaign. During that same time, the Avars increased their prestige by routing an army of Nader Shah at Andalal during the later stages of his Dagestan campaign. In the wake of this triumph, Umma Khan of the Avars (who reigned 1774–1801) managed to exact tribute from most states of the Caucasus, including Shirvan and Georgia.\n\nTwo years after Umma Khan's death in 1801, the khanate voluntarily submitted to Russian authority following the Russian annexation of Georgia and the Treaty of Georgievsk, but this only got confirmed after considerable Russian successes and the victory in the Russo-Persian War of 1804–1813, after which Persia lost southern Dagestan and many of the rest of its Caucasus territories to Russia. The 1828 Treaty of Turkmenchay indefinitely consolidated Russian control over Dagestan and other areas where the Avars lived and removed Iran from the military equation.\n\nThe Russian administration disappointed and embittered the freedom-loving highlanders. The Russians' institution of heavy taxation, coupled with the expropriation of estates and the construction of fortresses, electrified the Avar population into rising under the aegis of the Muslim Imamate of Dagestan, led by Ghazi Mohammed (1828–1832), Gamzat-bek (1832–1834) and Shamil (1834–1859).\n\nThis Caucasian War raged until 1864, when the Avarian Khanate was abolished and the Avarian District was instituted instead. One portion of the Avars refused to collaborate with Russians and migrated to Turkey, where their descendants live to this day. Although the population was decimated through war and emigration, the Avars retained their position as the dominant ethnic group in Dagestan during the Soviet period. After World War II, many Avars left the barren highlands for the fertile plains closer to the shores of the Caspian Sea.\n\nAvarians are a Northeast Caucasian people with a Northeast Caucasian language. Another tribe with common name \"Aβar\" according to \"Encyclopædia Britannica\", \"one of a people of undetermined origin and language\", was the so-called Turanian nomad people, which to make their presence as \"Pseudo-Avars\"—in opinion of ruler of Turkic qaganate (Gőktürks)—in Europe.\n\nAvarians inhabit most of the mountainous part of Dagestan as well as portions of the plains (Buynaksk, Khasav'yurt, Kizil'yurt and other regions). They also live in Chechnya, Kalmykia and other regions of the Russian state, as well as in Azerbaijan (mainly in the Balakan and Zakatala rayons, with a population of 50,900 in 1999 and 49,800 in 2009) and Georgia (Kvareli Avars with 1,996 people in 2002).\n\nIn 2002, Avarians, who have assimilated with ethnic groups speaking related languages, numbered about 1.04 million, of which 912,020 live in Russia (2010 census). Of those living in Russia, 850,011 are in Dagestan (2010 census), 32% of them in cities (2002).\nIn Turkey, the population census figures for the North Caucasian population are not given as they are considered as \"ethnic Turks\". According to Ataev B.M., according to A.M. Magomeddadaev's research, the Avarian population there should have been around 53,000 in 2005.\nAvarians call themselves \"Awaral\" (also \"Ma'arulal\").\n\nAvarian is a collective term for the Avar-Andi-Dido (Tsez) peoples and generalizes to various ethnic groups native to the foothills.\n\n\"МагIарулал\" \"Ma'arulal\" means \"inhabitants of the top grounds, mountaineers\", but another group of Avarians is described as belonging to another category, \"Хьиндалал\" \"X'indalal\" (with a soft \"χ\"), namely, \"inhabitants of plains (warm valleys) and gardeners\". The name \"Avarians\" has a narrower meaning for Avarians, especially a national one connected with former statehood. \"Avar\" is a significant part of the word \"Avaria\" for the Khunzakh Khanate that formed approximately in the 12th century after the disintegration of the local Sаrir (\"The Throne\") empire. From the middle of the 19th century this territory was the Avarian District of the Daghestanian area. Now it is Khunzakhsky District (χunzaχ in a literary Avarian language or χwnzaa in a local dialect) of Dagestan.\n\nThe modern literary language of Avarias (Awar mac'), both in olden times and today, is known among Avarians as the language of \"boʔ\" (bolmac'). The Avarian word \"bo\" \"army, armed people\", according to reconstructions, was originally *ʔωar in the proto-Avarian language (\"ʔ\" is here a glottal stop).\n\nAt the same time, in modern Avarian there are three words retaining their ancient basis of \"awar\": awarag \"the envoy, prophet, messiah\", awara \"obstacle, opposition\" (awara habize is \"to make an obstacle, to resist\") and awari \"pommel of a saddle\". There is also an Avarian river – \"Awar ʕωr\" (in Avarian) and \"Avar koysu\" in Russian.\n\nAll three listed words are to be found in ancient lexicons of the Iranian languages: Parthian \"apar\" Pahlavi/Middle-Pers. abar/aβar = \"up, on, over\" and \"higher, superior\" (also abraz \"acclivity\"); abarag/aβarag \"superior\", abargar/aβargar \"god, divinity\", abarmanig/aβarmanig \"noble\"; apar amatan \"to surpass\", apar kardan/apar handaχtan \"to attack\".\n\nAt the same time, according to the morphology and grammatic rules of the Middle-Persian language, Aβarag \"superior\" can also be translated as \"Aβarian\", \"Khurasanian\", \"Parthian\" as seen, for example, in a Middle-Persian word, Eranag – \"Iranian\".\n\nThe term \"Avar\" was known in the 10th century. According to Persian author Ibn Rustah a so-called governor of Sarir, the first authentic mention of a population of Daghestanian Highlanders under the name \"Avars\" belongs to Yohann de Galonifontibus, who wrote in 1404 that in the Caucasus there live \"Circassians, Leks, Yasses, Alans, Avars, Kazikumukhs\". According to Vladimir Minorsky, in Zafer, (written in 1424), Daghestanian Avars are called the Auhar. Abbas Kuli-Aga-Bakikhanov in his book Gulistan-i Iram (1841) based on the chronicle \"Derbend-name\" wrote that the \"inhabitants of vicinities of Agran have been moved here from Khurasan. A residence of this emir also was Agran\". The editor of this book, an academician of the Academy of Sciences of Azerbaijan, Z.M. Buniyatov, confirms that the district of Agran corresponds to the Caucasian Avaria. This word \"Agran\" is now unknown to modern Avars, but according to the \"Altiranisches Wörterbuch\" of Christian Bartholomae, aγra means \"erste, oberste; Anfang, Spitze\" (first, upper, beginning, tip) and aγra'va \"vom Obersten, von der Oberseite stammend\" (from the top, coming from the upper side).\n\nNöldeke, Hübschmann, Frye, Christensen and Enoki identify the Aparshahr/Abarshahr/Abharshahr/Abrashahr with Khurasan, or Nishapur. The Khurasan (χwarasan) in Iranian studies known as \"rise of Sun\", Parthian \"apar\" (Middle Persian/Pahlavi \"abar\"/\"aβar\" \"up, on, over\" and Parthian/Middle Persian \"šahr\" are cognate with old Iranian \"χšaθra\" \"empire, power, the sovereign house\".) In summary, Aparšahr/Aβaršahr is very similar to the German word \"Oberland\". According to H.W. Haussig, Aβaršahr means \"Reich der Abar\" (kingdom of the Abar) and should be sought in the south-western territory of the Western Turkish Empire.\n\nA Dahae tribe, the Aparnak (Parni) moved from the south-eastern shore of the Caspian (now part of modern Turkmenistan), into the territory of Khurasan (including the area of Gorgan), where they founded a Dahae confederation of tribes that was referred to as \"barbarians\" and \"enemies of Aryans\" in Avestani texts, according to Christian Bartholomae.\n\nOn the border of Khurasan, the Sassanides built a strong wall, named the \"Great Wall of Gorgan\" or \"The Red Snake\", was built to protect Iran from invasion by the so-called White Huns (Hepthalites; Khionites, X'iiaona and Xyôn in Zoroastrian texts). Later another wave of White Huns obtained control over Khurasan and kept it for a long time. According to Richard Helli: \"By such reasoning, the Ephthalites are thought to have originated at Hsi-mo-ta-lo (southwest of Badakhshan and near the Hindu Kush), which tantalizingly, stands for Himtala, \"snow plain\", which may be the Sanskritized form of Hephthal. In 484 the Hephthalite chief Akhshunwar led his army to attack the Sassanian King Peroz (459–484), who was defeated and killed in Khurasan. After the victory, the Hephthalite empire extended to Merv and Herat. Some of the White Huns concluded a peace treaty with Iran and the two became allies, both fighting against Byzantium. Thus, Hephthalites really lived in the Khurasan/Khorasan area. According to the Chinese classic Liang chih-kung-t'u, 滑 (pinyin: hua) was the name the Hephthalites used for themselves, and that is probably a Chinese transfer of a similar-sounding word, war/Uar.\n\nMehmed Tezcan writes that according to a Chinese record, the Hephthalites descended from a Ruan Ruan tribe called Hua in the Qeshi region (Turfan area). This tribe came to Tokharistan and soon settled also in eastern regions of Khorasan at the beginning of the 5th century. About the same time, the name Avars/Awards appears in the sources. Again, in his well-known Atlas of China, A. Herrmann shows the eastern regions of Khorasan, Tokharistan, etc. as the dominions of Afu/Hua/Awards/Hephthalites between ca. 440 and 500 A.D., relying on the identification Hua = Uar = Awar.\n\nThe German researcher Karl Menges, well known in the scientific world, considered Eurasian Avars to be one of the ancient Mongol peoples, who \"were the first to use the title ga gan (later qān, ḵān) for their supreme ruler.\" Further listing ancient Mongol speaking peoples, he obviously has in view Avars Caucasian when he mentions the \"traces of a Mongol residue in Daghestan\". Supporters of the so-called old Turanian nomad horde \"infiltrate\" point of view (with various clauses) include the following scientists: Josef Marquart, Omeljan Pritsak, Vladimir Minorsky, Vladimir Baileys, Harald Haarmann, Murad Magomedov, Alikber Alikberov, and Timur Aytberov.\n\nThe Avar language belongs to the Avar-Andi-Tsez subgroup of the Alarodian Northeast Caucasian (or Nakh–Dagestanian) language family. The writing is based on the Cyrillic script, which replaced the Arabic script used before 1927 and the Latin script used between 1927 and 1938. More than 60% of the Avars living in Dagestan speak Russian as their second language.\n\nThe most prominent figures in Avar history were Umma Khan Avarian, Hadji Murat, and Imam Shamil. The most celebrated poet writing in the Avar language was Rasul Gamzatov (1923–2003). In Azerbaijan, there was an ethnic Avar Member of the Parliament (MP), Ali Antsukhskiy (elected in 1995), who was killed in 1996.\n\nFamous Avar artists include Halil-Beg Mussayassul, whose drawings were shown at the New York Metropolitan Museum of Art, and Kamil Aliev (a distant cousin of Mussayassul) who is noted for his ornamental carpet work.\n\n\n"}

A graduate of George Washington University, where he earned his PhD in Physics under the direction of Edward Teller in 1939, he conducted research in ballistics at the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton and the Ballistic Research Laboratory at the Aberdeen Proving Ground, and received three patents for improved sabot designs.\n\nIn 1943, Teller and Robert Oppenheimer persuaded Critchfield to come to the Manhattan Project's Los Alamos National Laboratory, where he joined the Ordnance Division under Captain William Parsons on the gun-type fission weapons, Little Boy and Thin Man. After it was discovered that the Thin Man design would not work, he was transferred to Robert Bacher's Gadget Division as the leader of the Initiator group, which was responsible for the design and testing of the \"Urchin\" neutron initiator that provided the burst of neutrons that kick-started the nuclear detonation of the Fat Man weapon.\n\nAfter the war he became a professor at the University of Minnesota, and then vice president for research at the Convair division of General Dynamics, where he worked on the Atlas family of rockets. In 1961, J. Carson Mark and Norris Bradbury offered him a position at Los Alamos, which he held until he retired in 1977.\n\nCharles Louis Critchfield was born in Shreve, Ohio, on June 7, 1910, and grew up in Washington, D.C. He received his B.S. (1934) and M.A. (1936) degrees in Mathematics from George Washington University, where he also earned a PhD in Physics (1939) under the direction of Edward Teller.\n\nDuring Critchfield's graduate studies, Teller's colleague George Gamow introduced him to Hans Bethe, with whom he wrote a paper in 1938, which analyzed the nuclear fusion of protons into deuterons. The next year, Bethe showed that this process is a key link in the proton-proton chain reaction and the CNO cycle, which are the major ways that nuclear energy is released in the solar core and in massive stars. In 1967, Bethe was awarded the Nobel Prize for this work on stellar nucleosynthesis.\n\nAfter he graduated, Critchfield taught optics for a year at the University of Rochester at the invitation of Victor Weisskopf. In 1940, he was awarded a National Research Council fellowship, and went to work under Eugene Wigner at the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton. At this time, Robert Kent had just recruited John von Neumann to the advisory board of the Ballistic Research Laboratory at the Aberdeen Proving Ground. Critchfield joined von Neumann and Wigner there on several visits.\nIn 1942, after a brief stay at Harvard University, Critchfield went to the Carnegie Institution of Washington, where he continued his ballistic studies, which resulted in three patents for improved sabot designs. Because of his experience with ballistics, Teller and Robert Oppenheimer persuaded Critchfield to come to the Manhattan Project's Los Alamos National Laboratory in 1943, where he joined the Ordnance Division under Captain William Parsons. As leader of the target, projectile, and source group, he worked on the gun-type fission weapons, Little Boy and Thin Man.\n\nIn April 1944, the Manhattan Project experienced a crisis when Emilio Segrè discovered that plutonium made in nuclear reactors would not work in Thin Man. In response, Oppenheimer completely reorganized the laboratory to focus on development of an implosion-type nuclear weapon in August. He reassigned Critchfield to a new Gadget Division under Robert Bacher, as the leader of the Initiator group. This group was responsible for the design and testing of the \"Urchin\" neutron initiator, which provided a burst of neutrons that kick-started the nuclear detonation of the Fat Man weapon.\n\nCritchfield left Los Alamos in 1946 and returned to George Washington University, but soon left to join Wigner at the Oak Ridge National Laboratory. In 1947 he became an assistant professor at the University of Minnesota, where he participated, with Edward P. Ney and John R. Winckler, in a classified project to improve balloon technology. Here, with Leland S. Bohl, he invented and patented the natural shape balloon, and participated, with Ney and his student Sophie Oleksa, in an early search for primary cosmic ray electrons.\n\nIn 1955, after advancing to full professor at Minnesota, Critchfield became vice president for research at the Convair division of General Dynamics. Here, he worked on the Atlas family of rockets, which began as a series of ICBMs and evolved into launch vehicles for Project Mercury and many other space missions. He also created the Convair Scientific Research Laboratory whose staff were expected to serve as consultants for the company's engineering divisions and to carry out basic scientific research. In 1957, Critchfield's student William C. Erickson joined the staff, and created the Clark Lake Radio Observatory. In 1963, this facility, where observations focused on long wavelength radio waves, was transferred to the University of Maryland, where Erickson had become a professor. Although the original observatory has been abandoned, similar research continues at the much larger Long Wavelength Array in central New Mexico.\n\nIn early November 1959, President Dwight D. Eisenhower's Secretary of Defense Neil H. McElroy selected Critchfield to be head of the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency. McElroy hoped that Critchfield would be able to fix the nation's trouble missile program, but Critchfield was reluctant to serve at the director's $19,000 salary. McElroy then offered to let Critchfield serve without pay, with the government paying only his expenses of $15 per day, while allowing Critchfield to continue to draw his Convair salary of around $40,000. Critchfield accepted this offer, but ran into a storm of political and media criticism over the conflict of interest involved in heading an agency that did $4 million worth of business with Convair each year. Critchfield then withdrew his name from consideration.\n\nIn 1961, Critchfield accepted a professorship at the University of Wisconsin, but before he moved to Madison, his friends at Los Alamos, J. Carson Mark and Norris Bradbury offered him a position there that he took instead. He held this position until he retired in 1977, but he continued his association with the laboratory until his death after a long battle with cancer on February 12, 1994. His obituary in Physics Today was written by Carson Mark, Louis Rosen, Edward Teller, and Roger Meade.\n\nCharles Critchfield is buried next to his wife, Jean, in Guaje Pines Cemetery in Los Alamos County, New Mexico.\n\n"}
{"id": "606917", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=606917", "title": "Christian Rakovsky", "text": "Christian Rakovsky\n\nChristian Rakovsky ( – September 11, 1941) was a Bulgarian socialist revolutionary, a Bolshevik politician and Soviet diplomat; he was also noted as a journalist, physician, and essayist. Rakovsky's political career took him throughout the Balkans and into France and Imperial Russia; for part of his life, he was also a Romanian citizen.\n\nA lifelong collaborator of Leon Trotsky, he was a prominent activist of the Second International, involved in politics with the Bulgarian Social Democratic Union, Romanian Social Democratic Party, and the Russian Social Democratic Labour Party. Rakovsky was expelled at different times from various countries as a result of his activities, and, during World War I, became a founding member of the Revolutionary Balkan Social Democratic Labor Federation while helping to organize the Zimmerwald Conference. Imprisoned by Romanian authorities, he made his way to Russia, where he joined the Bolshevik Party after the October Revolution, and, as head of the \"Rumcherod\", unsuccessfully attempted to generate a communist revolution in the Kingdom of Romania. Subsequently, he was a founding member of the Comintern, served as head of government in the Ukrainian SSR, and took part in negotiations at the Genoa Conference.\n\nHe came to oppose Joseph Stalin and rallied with the Left Opposition, being marginalized inside the government and sent as Soviet ambassador to London and Paris, where he was involved in renegotiating financial settlements. He was ultimately recalled from France in autumn 1927, after signing his name to a controversial Trotskyist platform which endorsed world revolution. Credited with having developed the Trotskyist critique of Stalinism as \"bureaucratic centrism\", Rakovsky was subject to internal exile. Submitting to Stalin's leadership in 1934 and being briefly reinstated, he was nonetheless implicated in the Trial of the Twenty One (part of the Moscow Trials), imprisoned, and executed by the NKVD during World War II. He was rehabilitated in 1988, during the Soviet \"Glasnost\" period.\n\nRakovsky's original Bulgarian name was \"Krastyo Georgiev Stanchev\" (Кръстьо Георгиев Станчев), which he himself changed to \"Krastyo Rakovski\" (Кръстьо Раковски). The usual form his first name took in Romanian was \"Cristian\" (occasionally rendered as \"Christian\"), while his last name was spelled \"Racovski\", \"Racovschi\", or \"Rakovski\". His given name was occasionally rendered as \"Ristache\", an antiquated hypocoristic—he was known as such to his acquaintance, the writer Ion Luca Caragiale.\n\nIn Russian, his full name, including patronymic, was \"Khristian Georgievich Rakovsky\" (Христиан Георгиевич Раковский). \"Christian\" (as well as \"Cristian\" and \"Kristian\") is an approximate rendition of \"Krastyo\" (the Bulgarian for \"cross\"), as used by Rakovsky himself. In Ukrainian, Rakovsky's name is rendered as Християн Георгійович Раковський, and usually transliterated as \"Khrystyyan Georgiiovych Rakovsky\".\n\nDuring his lifetime, he was also known under the pseudonyms \"H. Insarov\" and \"Grigoriev\", which he used in signing several articles for the Russian-language press.\n\nChristian Rakovsky was born to a wealthy Bulgarian family in Gradets—near Kotel—at the time still part of Ottoman-ruled Rumelia. He was, on his mother's side, the nephew of Georgi Sava Rakovski, a revolutionary hero of the Bulgarian National Revival; that side of his family also included Georgi Mamarchev, who had fought against the Ottomans in the Imperial Russian Army. Rakovsky's father was a merchant who belonged to the Democratic Party.\n\nHe later stated that, as early as his childhood years, he had felt a special admiration towards Russia, and that he had been impressed by witnessing, at age 5, the Russo-Turkish War and Russian presence (he claimed to have met General Eduard Totleben during the conflict). Although his parents moved to the Kingdom of Romania in 1880, settling in Gherengic (Northern Dobruja), he completed his education in newly emancipated Bulgaria. Rakovsky was expelled from the gymnasium in Gabrovo for his political activities (in 1887 and then again, after organizing a riot, in 1890). It was around that time that he became a Marxist, and began collaborating with the socialist journalist Evtim Dabev, whom he aided in printing works by Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels (at the time, Rakovsky and Sava Balabanov also published their own newspaper, the clandestine \"Zerkalo\").\n\nSince, after having ultimately been banned from attending any public school in the country, he could not complete his education in Bulgaria, in September 1890 Rakovsky went to Geneva to begin his studies and become a physician. While in Switzerland, he joined the Socialist Student Circle at the University of Geneva, which was largely composed of non-Swiss youth.\n\nA polyglot, Rakovsky became close to Georgy Plekhanov, the founder of Russian Marxism, and his circle, eventually writing a number of articles and a book in Russian. He also briefly worked with Rosa Luxemburg, Pavel Axelrod and Vera Zasulich. Unable to attend the First International Congress of Socialist Students in Brussels (1892), he became involved in organizing the Second Congress, held in Geneva during the fall of 1893.\n\nHe was a founding editor of the Geneva-based Bulgarian-language magazine \"Sotsial-Demokrat\" and later a major contributor to the Bulgarian Marxist publications \"Den\"', \"Rabotnik\", and \"Drugar\". At the time, Rakovsky and Balabanov, with Plekhanov's encouragement, stressed the importance for moderation in socialist policies—\"Sotsial-Demokrat\" rallied with the Bulgarian Social Democratic Union and rejected the more radical Social-Democratic Party of Bulgaria. He soon became involved in distributing socialist propaganda inside Bulgaria, at a time when Stefan Stambolov organized a crackdown on political opposition.\n\nLater in 1893, Rakovsky enrolled in a medical school in Berlin, contributing articles for \"Vorwärts\" and becoming close to Wilhelm Liebknecht (the two corresponded regularly for the rest of Liebknecht's life). As a Bulgarian delegate to the Second International Congress in Zürich, he also met with Engels and Jules Guesde.\n\nSix months later, he was arrested and expelled from the German Empire for maintaining close contacts with the Russian revolutionaries there. He finished his education in 1894–1896 in Zürich, Nancy and Montpellier, where he wrote for \"La Jeunesse Socialiste\" and \"La Petite République\", maintaining a friendship with Guesde and becoming an opponent of Jean Jaurès' reformist views. According to his own testimony, he became active in supporting the Anti-Ottoman upsurge in Crete and Macedonia, as well as Dashnak revolutionary activities. In 1896, he was the Bulgarian representative to the Second International's London Congress (part of his speech was published in Karl Kautsky's \"Die Neue Zeit\").\n\nAlthough actively involved in many European countries' socialist movements, prior to 1917 Rakovsky's focus remained on the Balkans and especially on his native country and Romania; his activities in support of the international socialist movement led to his expulsion, at different times, from Germany, Bulgaria, Romania, France and Russia.\n\nIn 1897 he published \"Russiya na Istok\" (\"Russia in the East\"), a book sharply critical of the Russian Empire's foreign policy, which, according to Rakovsky, followed one of Georgy Plekhanov's guidelines (\"Tsarist Russia must be isolated in its foreign relations\"). On several occasions, he publicly criticized Russia's policies towards Romania and in Bessarabia (describing Russia's rule over the latter as \"absolutist conquest\", \"mischievous action\", and \"abduction\"). According to Rakovsky, \"Russophile papers\" in Bulgaria had begun to target him as a consequence.\n\nAfter completing his education as a physician at the University of Montpellier (with the thesis \"L'Éthiologie du crime et de la dégénérescence\" – \"The Cause of Crime and Degeneration\", submitted in 1897), Rakovsky, who had married the Russian student E. P. Ryabova, was summoned to Romania in order to be drafted in the Romanian Army, and served as a medic in the 9th Cavalry Regiment stationed in Constanţa, Dobruja (1899–1900). He rose to the rank of lieutenant.\n\nRakovsky subsequently rejoined his wife in Saint Petersburg, where he hoped to settle down and engage in revolutionary activities (he was probably expelled after an initial attempt to enter the country, but was allowed to return). An adversary of Peter Berngardovich Struve after the latter moved towards market liberalism, he became acquainted with, among others, Nikolay Mikhaylovsky and Mikhail Tugan-Baranovsky, while authoring articles for \"Nashe Slovo\" and helping distribute \"Iskra\". His close relationship with Plekhanov led Rakovsky to a position between the Menshevik and Bolshevik factions of the Russian Social Democratic Labor Party, one he kept from 1903 to 1917; the Bolshevik leader Vladimir Lenin was initially hostile to Rakovsky, and at one point wrote to Karl Radek that \"we [the Bolsheviks] do not have the same road as his kind of people\".\n\nInitially, Rakovsky was expelled from Russia and had to move back to Paris. Returning to the Russian capital in 1900, he remained there until 1902, when his wife's death and the crackdown on socialist groups ordered by Emperor Nicholas II forced him to return to France. Working for a while as a physician in the village of Beaulieu, Haute-Loire, he asked French officials to review his case for naturalization, but was refused.\n\nIn 1903, following the death of his father, Rakovsky again lived in Paris, where he followed developments of the Russo-Japanese War and spoke out against Russia, attracting, according to Rakovsky himself, the criticism of both Plekhanov and Jules Guesde. He voiced his opposition to the concession made by Karl Kautsky to Jean Jaurès, one which had allowed socialists to join \"bourgeois\" governments in times of crisis.\n\nHe ultimately settled in Romania (1904) having inherited his father's estate near Mangalia. In 1913, his property, valued at some 40,000 United States dollars at the time, was home to Leon Trotsky—when the latter visited the Balkans as a press envoy in the Balkan Wars. He was usually present in Bucharest on a weekly basis, and started an intense activity as a journalist, doctor and lawyer. The Balkans correspondent for \"L'Humanité\", he was also personally responsible for reviving \"România Muncitoare\", the defunct journal of the Romanian socialist group, provoking successful strike actions which brought him to the attention of officials.\n\nChristian Rakovsky also traveled to Bulgaria, where he eventually sided with the \"Tesnyatsi\" in their conflict with other socialist groups. In 1904, he was present at the Second International's Congress in Amsterdam, where he gave a speech celebrating the assassination of Russian police chief Vyacheslav von Plehve by Socialist-Revolutionary Party members.\n\nRakovsky became noted locally especially after 1905, when he organized rallies in support of the Battleship Potemkin revolt (the events worsened relations between Russia and the Romanian Kingdom), carried out a relief operation for the \"Potemkin\" crew as their ship sought refuge in Constanţa, and attempted to determine them to set sail for Batumi and aid striking workers there. According to his own account, a parallel scandal occurred when an armed Bolshevik ship was captured in Romanian territorial waters; Rakovsky, who indicated that the weapons on board were to be used in Batumi, faced allegations in the Romanian press that he was preparing a Dobrujan insurrection.\n\nHis head was injured during street clashes with police forces over the \"Potemkin\" issue; while recovering, Rakovsky befriended the Romanian poets Ştefan Octavian Iosif and Dimitrie Anghel, who were publishing works under a common signature—one of the two authored a sympathetic portrait of the socialist leader, based on his recollections from the early 1900s. Throughout these years, Rakovsky, was, according to Iosif and Anghel, \"continuously bustling; disappearing and appearing in workers' centers, be it in Brăila, be it in Galaţi, be it in Iaşi, be it anywhere, always preaching with the same undaunted fervor and fanatical conviction his social credo\".\n\nRakovsky was drawn into a polemic with the Romanian authorities, facing public accusations that, as a Bulgarian, he lacked patriotism; in return, he commented that, if patriotism meant \"race prejudice, international and civil war, political tyranny and plutocratic domination\", he refused to be identified with it. Upon the outbreak of Romanian Peasants' Revolt of 1907, Rakovsky was especially vocal: he launched accusations at the National Liberal government, arguing that, having profited from the early antisemitic message of the revolt, it had violently repressed it from the moment peasants began to attack landowners. Supportive of the thesis according to which the peasantry had revolutionary importance inside Romanian society and Eastern Europe at large, Rakovsky publicized his perspective in the socialist press (writing articles on the subject for \"România Muncitoare\", \"L'Humanité\", \"Avanti!\", \"Vorwärts\" and others). Rakovsky was also one of the journalists suspected of having greatly exaggerated the overall death toll in their accounts: his estimates speak of over 10,000 peasants killed, whereas the government data counted only 421.\n\nHe became close to the influential dramatist Ion Luca Caragiale, who was living in Berlin at the time. Caragiale authored his own virulent critique of the Romanian state and its handling of the revolt, an essay titled \"1907, din primăvară până în toamnă\" (\"1907, From Spring to Autumn\"), which, in its final version, adopted some of Rakovsky's suggestions.\n\nAfter repeatedly condemning repression of the revolt, Rakovsky was, together with other socialists, officially accused of having agitated rebellious sentiment, and consequently expelled from Romanian soil (late 1907). He received news of this action while already abroad, in Stuttgart (at the Seventh Congress of the Second International). He decided not to recognize it, and contended that his father had settled in Northern Dobruja before the Treaty of Berlin that had awarded the region to Romania; the plea was rejected by the Court of Appeal, based on evidence that Rakovsky's father was not in Dobruja before 1880, and that Rakovsky himself used a Bulgarian passport when moving across borders. During the 1920s, Rakovsky was still viewing the incident as a \"blatantly illegal act\".\n\nThe action itself caused protests from leftist politicians and sympathizers, including, among others, the influential Marxist thinker Constantin Dobrogeanu-Gherea (whose appeal in favor of Rakovsky was described by Iosif and Anghel as evidence of \"an almost parental love\"). The local socialists organized several rallies in his support, and the return of his citizenship was also backed by Take Ionescu's opposition group, the Conservative-Democratic Party. In exile, Rakovsky authored the pamphlet \"Les persécutions politiques en Roumanie\" (\"Political Persecutions in Romania\") and two books (\"La Roumanie des boyars\" – \"Boyar Romania\", and the since-lost \"From the Kingdom of Arbitrariness and Cowardice\").\n\nEventually, he traveled back into Romania in October 1909, only to be arrested upon his transit through Brăila County. According to his recollections, he was for long left stranded on the border with Austria-Hungary, as officials in the latter country refused to let him pass; the situation had to be settled by negotiations between the two countries. Also according to Rakovsky, the arrest was hidden by the Ion I. C. Brătianu cabinet until it leaked to the press—this, coupled with rumors that he was about to be killed, and Brătianu's statement that he would \"rather destroy [Rakovsky] than let [him] back into Rumania\", caused a series of important street clashes between his supporters and government forces. On December 9, 1909, a Romanian Railways employee named Stoenescu attempted to assassinate Brătianu. The event, which was attributed by Rakovsky to support for his return and by other sources to government manipulation, caused a clampdown on \"România Muncitoare\" (among those socialists arrested and interrogated were Gheorghe Cristescu, I. C. Frimu, and Dumitru Marinescu).\n\nRakovsky secretly returned to Romania in 1911, giving himself up in Bucharest. According to Rakovsky, he was again expelled, holding a Romanian passport, to Istanbul, where he was swiftly arrested by the Young Turks government but released soon after. He subsequently left for Sofia, where he established the Bulgarian socialist journal \"Napred\". Ultimately, the new Petre P. Carp Conservative cabinet agreed to allow his return to Romania, following pressures from the French Premier Georges Clemenceau (who answered an appeal by Jean Jaurès). According to Rakovsky, this was also determined by the Conservative change in policies towards the peasantry. He unsuccessfully ran for Parliament during the elections of that year (and several others in succession), being fully reinstated as a citizen in April 1912. Romanian journalist Stelian Tănase contends that the expulsion had instilled resentment in Rakovsky; earlier, the leading National Liberal politician Ion G. Duca himself had argued that Rakovsky was developing a \"hatred for Romania\".\n\nAlongside Mihai Gheorghiu Bujor and Frimu, Rakovsky was one of the founders of the Romanian Social Democratic Party (PSDR), serving as its president. In May 1912, he helped organize a mourning session for the centennial of Russian rule in Bessarabia, and authored numerous new articles on the matter. He was afterwards involved in calling for peace during the Balkan Wars; notably, Rakovsky expressed criticism of Romania's invasion of Bulgaria during the Second Balkan War, and called on Romanian authorities not to annex Southern Dobruja. Alongside Frimu, Bujor, Ecaterina Arbore and others, he lectured at the PSDR's propaganda school during the short period the latter was in existence (in 1910 and again in 1912–1913).\n\nIn 1913, Rakovsky was married a second time, to Alexandrina Alexandrescu (also known as Ileana Pralea), a socialist militant and intellectual, who taught mathematics in Ploieşti. Alexandrescu was herself a friend of Dobrogeanu-Gherea and an acquaintance of Caragiale. She had previously been married to Filip Codreanu, a Narodnik activist born in Bessarabia, with whom she had a daughter, Elena, and a son, Radu.\n\nRallying with the left wing of international social democracy during the early stages of World War I, Rakovsky later indicated that he had been purposely informed of the controversial pro-war stance taken by the Social Democratic Party of Germany by the pro-Entente Romanian Foreign Minister Emanuel Porumbaru. With staff of the Menshevik paper \"Nashe Slovo\" (edited by Leon Trotsky), he was among the most prominent socialist pacifists of the period. Reflecting his ideological priorities, \"România Muncitoare\"'s title was changed into \"Jos Răsboiul!\" (\"Down with war!\")—it was later to be known as \"Lupta Zilnică\" (the \"Daily combat\").\n\nHeavily critical of the French Socialist Party's decision to join the René Viviani cabinet (deeming it \"an abdication\"), he stressed the responsibility of all European countries in provoking the war, and adhered to Trotsky's vision of a \"Peace without indemnities or annexations\" as an alternative to \"imperialist war\". According to Rakovsky, tensions between the French SFIO and the German Social Democrats were reflecting not just context, but major ideological differences.\n\nPresent in Italy in March 1915, he attended the Milan Congress of the Italian Socialist Party, during which he attempted to persuade it to condemn irredentist goals. In July, after convening the Bucharest Conference, he and Vasil Kolarov established the Revolutionary Balkan Social Democratic Labor Federation (comprising the left-leaning socialist parties of Romania, Bulgaria, Serbia and Greece), and Rakovsky was elected first secretary of its Central Bureau.\n\nSubsequently, together with the Italian Socialist delegates (Oddino Morgari, Giacinto Menotti Serrati, and Angelica Balabanoff among them), Rakovsky was instrumental in convening the anti-war international socialist Zimmerwald Conference in September 1915. During the congress, he came into open conflict with Lenin, after the latter voiced the Zimmerwald Left's opposition to the resolution (at one point, Rakovsky reportedly lost his temper and grabbed Lenin, causing him to temporarily leave the hall in protest). Later, he continued to mediate between Lenin and the Second International, a situation from which emerged a circular letter that complemented the \"Zimmerwald Manifesto\" while being more radical in tone. In October 1915, he reportedly did not protest Bulgaria's entry into the war—this information was contradicted by Trotsky, who also indicated that the \"Tesniatsy\" had been the target of a government crackdown at that exact moment.\nRakovsky ran for Parliament for a final time during 1916, and again lost when contesting a seat in Covurlui County. Again arrested in 1916, after being accused of planning rebellion during a violent incident in Galaţi, he was, according to his own account, freed by a general strike which constituted \"an outburst of indignation among the workers\". Evaluating the situation in Romania, he identified the two main pro-Entente political forces of the moment, the groups led by Take Ionescu and Nicolae Filipescu, with, respectively, \"corruption\" and \"reaction\".\n\nSuspicions also rose that he had been contacted by German intelligence, that his 1915 trip to Italy had served German interests, and that he was being subsidized with German money. Rakovsky also drew attention to himself after welcoming to Bucharest the pro-German maverick socialist Alexander Parvus. His independence was consequently challenged by the interventionist paper \"Adevărul\", a former socialist venue, who called Rakovsky \"an adventurer without scruples\", and viewed him as employed by Parvus and other German socialists. Rakovsky himself alleged that, \"under the mask of independence\", \"Adevărul\" and its editor Constantin Mille were in the pay of Take Ionescu. After Romania's entry into the conflict on the side of the Entente in August 1916, having failed to attend the Kienthal Conference due to the closure of borders, he was placed under surveillance and ultimately imprisoned in September, based on the belief that he was acting as a German spy. As Bucharest fell to the Central Powers during the 1916 campaign, he was taken by Romanian authorities to their refuge in Iaşi. Held until after the February Revolution, he was freed by the Russian Army on May 1, 1917, and immediately left for Odessa.\n\nRakovsky moved to Petrograd (the new name of Saint Petersburg) in the spring of 1917. His anti-war activism almost got him arrested; Rakovsky managed to flee in August, and was present in Stockholm for the Third Zimmerwald Conference; he remained there and, with Karl Radek, issued propaganda material in support of the Russian revolutionaries. Present in the internationalist faction of the Mensheviks, he joined the Bolsheviks in December 1917 or early 1918, after the October Revolution (although he was occasionally listed among the Old Bolsheviks). Rakovsky later stated that he had friendly relations with the Bolsheviks from early autumn 1917, when, during the attempted putsch of Lavr Kornilov, he was hidden by these in Sestroretsk.\n\nHis rise in influence and his approval of world revolution led him to seek Lenin's support for a Bolshevik government over Romania, at a time when a similar attempt was being made by the Odessa-based \"Romanian Social Democratic Action Committee\", under the guidance of Mihai Gheorghiu Bujor; Stelian Tănase claims that during the period, a group of one hundred Russian Bolsheviks had infiltrated Iaşi with the goal of assassinating King Ferdinand I and organizing a coup. Eventually, Lenin decided in favor of a unified project, and called on Bujor and Rakovsky to form a single leadership (which also included the Romanian expatriates Alecu Constantinescu and Ion Dic Dicescu).\n\nAs the coup was under preparation in December 1917, Rakovsky was present on the border and waiting a signal to enter the country. When Bolsheviks were arrested and the move was overturned, he was probably responsible for ordering the arrest of Romania's representative to Petrograd, Constantin I. Diamandy, and his entire staff (all of whom were used as hostages, pending the release of prisoners taken in Iaşi). Trotsky, who was by then Russia's People's Commissar for Foreign Affairs (Foreign Minister), called on the Romanian government of Ion I. C. Brătianu to hand in persons captured, indicating that he would otherwise encourage the communist activities of Romanian refugees on Russian soil, and receiving a reply according to which no such arrests had occurred.\n\nAt the same time, Rakovsky regained Odessa, where he became a leader of the Bolshevik administrative body (\"Rumcherod\"), and, according to the claims of Stelian Tănase, ordered violent reprisals to be aimed at Romanian nationals present in the city, and issued agitprop literature in Romanian.\n\nAs Russia negotiated the Treaty of Brest-Litovsk with Germany, he ordered \"Rumcherod\" troops to march towards Romania, which was by then giving in to the German advances and preparing to sign its own peace. Initially stalled by a much-criticized temporary armistice with Romanian Army leader Alexandru Averescu, Rakovsky ordered a fresh offensive in Moldavia, but had to retreat when the Central Powers, confronted with Trotsky's refusal to accept their version of a Russo-German peace, began their own military operation and occupied Odessa (setting free Romanians who had been imprisoned there). On March 9, 1918, Rakovsky signed a treaty with Romania regarding the evacuation of troops from Bessarabia, which Stelian Tănase claims allowed for the Moldavian Democratic Republic to join Romania. In May, Romania conceded to the demands of the Central Powers (\"see Treaty of Bucharest, 1918\").In April–May 1918, he negotiated with the Ukrainian People's Republic Tsentral'na Rada, then with the Hetmanate of Pavlo Skoropadsky, as well as with German forces (\"see Ukraine after the Russian Revolution\"). Soon after, Rakovsky left for Austria (where the First Republic had been proclaimed), being received by Foreign Minister Victor Adler (a member of Karl Renner's Social Democratic Party of Austria cabinet). Rakovsky's real goal was to reach Germany and negotiate the situation in Ukraine, but he was expelled upon arrival to that country.\n\nEscorted, together with Adolph Joffe and Nikolai Bukharin, to the German-aligned Belarusian National Republic, he caught news of the collapse of the German Empire and was selected as a delegate to the German workers' councils. He and all other envoys were arrested by German soldiers in Kaunas, and sent to Minsk, then to Homyel, before making their way to Moscow.\n\nAfter the subsequent Soviet offensive in Ukraine, Lenin appointed Rakovsky as the Chairman of the Provisional Revolutionary Government of the Workers and Peasants of Ukraine, replacing Georgy Pyatakov on January 16, 1919 due to the latter's argument with Fyodor Sergeyev for excessive interference in Ukrainian affairs. On March 29, 1919 the government was reorganized as the Soviet of the People's Commissars. According to the British author Arthur Ransome, present in Moscow during early that year, \"It had been found that the views of the Pyatakov government were further left than those of its supporters, and so Pyatakov had given way to Rakovsky who was better able to conduct a more moderate policy\". While in office, Rakovsky totally ignored Ukrainian issues, considering Ukraine and its language merely \"an invention\" of intellectuals.\n\nAt the time, Rakovsky assessed the situation created by the Treaty of Versailles, and advised his superiors to build warm relations with both Mustafa Kemal's Turkey and the Weimar Republic, as a camp of countries dissatisfied with policies of the Allied Powers. Rakovsky subscribed to the Bolshevik condemnation of Greater Romania, stance that journalist Victor Frunză considered a revision of his previous views on Bessarabia. During the Paris Peace Conference, the Romanian delegation attributed the shortage in supply in Bessarabia and Transylvania a Bolshevik conspiracy centered on Rakovsky; various French reports of the time gave contradictory assessments (while some credited Rakovsky with direct influence on Soviet foreign policy, others dismissed the notion that Russia had any such projects).\n\nRakovsky simultaneously served as Soviet Ukraine's Commissar for Foreign Affairs and a member of the South West Front's Revolutionary Military Council, contributing to the defeat of the White Army and Ukrainian nationalists during the Russian Civil War, while theorizing that \"Ukraine was a laboratory of internationalism\" and \"a decisive factor in world revolution\". Rakovsky's presence was also decisive in rallying the dissident Borotbists to the Bolshevik faction's central bodies—he was subsequently confronted with a degree of Borotbist opposition inside his government. According to American politologist Jerry F. Hough, his appointment and policies were evidence of Russification, a program requested by Lenin himself; Rakovsky's view contrasted with that supported by Stalin, who, at the time, was calling for increased Ukrainianization. On 13 February 1919 at the session of Kiev city council Rakovsky as a head of Ukrainian government stated following: \"Decreeing the Ukrainian language as a state language is reactionary and unnecessary\".\nIn March 1919, Christian Rakovsky was one of the founding members of the Comintern, where he represented the Balkan Communist Federation. During those months, when control over the entire Ukraine was made possible by the offensive against Directorate forces, he expressed his support for the Yekaterinoslav wing of the Ukrainian Communist Party—following its wishes, he subordinated the Ukrainian Communists to the Russian Communist Party and argued that a separate Central Committee was \"luxury\" for such a small grouping.\n\nIn summer, as Rakovsky's government briefly lost control of Ukraine, his policies became hotly contested by partisans of Ukrainian autonomy inside the Party, who held a conference in Homyel (one which Rakovsky did not attend). At the Fourth Congress of the Ukrainian Party (March 1920), the leadership of Rakovsky, Stanislav Kosior, and Dmitry Manuilsky was not reelected. Attacks on them caused problems with the Russian Party; as Lenin himself sided with Rakovsky, a delegation comprising Trotsky, Lev Kamenev and Adolph Joffe left for Kiev to discuss the matter with local leaders. In order to curb the crisis, the Ukrainian Party was subjected to a major purge, during which pro-autonomy opposition was removed from its ranks and the former leaders were reinstated.\n\nAt the time, Rakovsky and Georgy Chicherin received harsh criticism from the Hungarian communist leaders Béla Kun, for allegedly refusing aid to the Hungarian Soviet Republic and thus contributing to its fall. This appears not to have been true, as Rakovsky reportedly urged Lenin to finance the Kun even as the latter faced the intervention of troops from both Romania and Czechoslovakia. Lenin wrote back to Kun informing him that the Central Committee was satisfied with the way in which Rakovsky and Chicherin had carried out their mission.\n\nAfter dealing with the common offensive of the Directorate and Polish forces—the Kiev Offensive (\"see Polish-Soviet War in 1920\")—, Rakovsky's government took measures regarding collectivization; according to his biographer Gus Fagan, he became himself a proponent of greater Ukrainian autonomy, and advocated both Ukrainization through the complete integration of Borotbists into Party structures and a slower pace in communization. He notably came into conflict with the Russian Party after his second executive had its independent Commissariat of Foreign Trade replaced with an office under the control of central authorities. He continued to pressure for a measure of independence in Ukrainian economy, and, during the early 1920s, the republic sealed its own trade agreements with other European countries.\n\nRakovsky remained a Romanian citizen for the entire period. In 1921, he was officially summoned to be tried by a court-martial for \"crime against the security of the Romanian state\". He was sentenced to death \"in absentia\" (1924). Journalist Victor Frunză claims this move had been prompted by a supposed similar verdict given by a Soviet Court to Ion Inculeţ (who had led the Moldavian Democratic Republic's Legislative Assembly that voted union with Romania). As the Socialist Party of Romania delegation (Gheorghe Cristescu, Eugen Rozvan, David Fabian, Constantin Popovici, Ioan Flueraş, and Alexandru Dobrogeanu-Gherea) voted to adhere to the Comintern, Rakovsky and Grigory Zinoviev pressured the group to expel those of its members who supported Greater Romania (including Flueraş and Popovici, as well as Iosif Jumanca and Leon Ghelerter).\n\nIn February 1922, he was sent to Berlin in order to negotiate with German officials, and, in March, was part of the official delegation to the Genoa Conference—under the leadership of Georgy Chicherin. Rakovsky himself was virulently opposed to any stalemate with the Allies, and urged his delegation not to abandon policies over promises of deescalation and trade. A leader of the delegation's commissions on economic aid, loans and government debt, he was also charged with renewing contacts with Germany—together with Adolph Joffe, he discussed the matter with the pro-Soviet Ago von Maltzan, and, as Russia failed to reach an agreement with the Allies, managed to obtain from Germany promises of cooperation (\"see Treaty of Rapallo, 1922\"). Two years later, when captured by the Bolsheviks, Eser conspirator Boris Savinkov allegedly confessed that he intended to have both Rakovsky and Chicherin killed in Berlin, as they returned from Genoa. In November 1922, Rakovsky attended the Conference of Lausanne, where he was confronted with the assassination of his fellow diplomat Vaslav Vorovsky by the \"émigré\" Maurice Conradi.\n\nAs the Soviet Union was being created, Rakovsky became opposed to the new central leadership over the issue of self-determination for the Soviet republics and autonomous republics. This followed the dispute between, on one side, Joseph Stalin, Zinoviev, Totsky and Kamenev, and, on the other, the leadership of the Georgian SSR (\"see Georgian Affair\"). At the time, he evidenced a \"permanent struggle which the so-called independent and autonomous republics had to carry out to safeguard not only their prerogatives but their very own existence\". Arguing in favor of extending the revolution from Ukraine to the Balkans, and indicating his belief that the peasantry was being alienated by internationalist messages, Rakovsky cited concerns that centralism was placing Soviet influence in peril, and called for \"carrying out a correct theoretical and practical solution to the national question within the boundaries of the Soviet Union\". In November 1922, he successfully proposed the formation of a Soviet of Nationalities to double the Soviet of the Union inside the supreme legislative body; his arguments in favor of reducing the number of representatives of Russian SFSR and barring the total number of envoys from any republic at one fifth of the total were dismissed after being criticized by Stalin.\n\nAfter Lenin's illness and incapacitation, Rakovsky joined Leon Trotsky's Left Opposition and came into conflict with Stalin. Although declining, his influence in Ukraine was, according to political scientist John P. Willerton, one of Trotsky's main bases of support, alongside sections of the Red Army, a group of Komsomol leaders, and various officials involved in economic planning. In early July 1923, after being isolated inside the Ukrainian leadership, he was removed from his Ukrainian post, replaced with Vlas Chubar, and sent to London to negotiate a formal recognition of the Soviet regime by the British and French governments. Chubar, an ethnic Ukrainian, came to represent Stalin's view on nationality issues in the region, officially defined as \"nativization\". In London, Rakovsky and his wife were joined by Elena Codreanu, whom they had adopted.\n\nIn 1924, as the Labour Party minority cabinet came to power, Ramsay MacDonald and Rakovsky negotiated \"de jure\" recognition and agreed on possible future Anglo-Soviet treaty and a British loan for the Soviet Union. Negotiations were tested by the so-called \"Bankers' Memorandum\", published by \"The Times\", which demanded that the Soviet Union abandon nationalizations and return to private property. Eventually, two treaties were signed, allowing for commerce to be normalized between the two countries, and reflecting Rakovsky's views that private complaints of creditors against the Soviet state were to be settled outside the conference. The scandal which erupted when the \"Zinoviev Letter\" was publicized, rekindling suspicions against the Soviet government and provoking the fall of MacDonald's cabinet, brought an end to all further talks; during and after the incident, Rakovsky repeatedly cited evidence that the \"Letter\" was a forgery.\n\nIn parallel, he had begun negotiations with France's Raymond Poincaré, who aimed for a \"solidarity of foreign creditors\" in respect to the Soviet state, and who agreed to recognize the latter on October 28, 1924. One of his last tasks involved placing Soviet orders for machinery, textiles, and other commodities with British manufacturers: worth 75 million US$ on paper, these failed to attract attention after he announced that the Soviet government did not intend to pay in cash. According to the American magazine \"Time\", Rakovsky also played a hand in motivating Stalin's decision to marginalize Comintern leader Zinoviev, by complaining that the latter's foreign policy was needlessly radical.\n\nRakovsky served as the Soviet ambassador to France between October 1925 and October 1927, replacing Leonid Krasin. He did not take hold of his office until 50 days after his official appointment, refusing to be received at the Élysée Palace by French President Gaston Doumergue for as long as the state authorities would not allow \"The Internationale\" (a revolutionary song which was at the time the Soviet national anthem) to be played on the occasion. Doumergeue resisted, and, in the end, Rakovsky was received to the sound of an improvised arrangement of bugles, the more discreet part of which may have been based on \"The Internationale\". \"Time\" described it as a \"deafening blast\".\n\nHis first task involved renewed negotiations with the cabinet of Aristide Briand (February 1926), during which he was confronted with the vocal campaign of creditors. Early results achieved in discussions with Anatole de Monzie were dismissed by the opposition rallied around Poincaré, and, after being revived by the short-lived cabinet of Édouard Herriot, talks ended without any result. Poincaré returned to power, and France remained committed to the Locarno Treaties (which had isolated the Soviet state on the international stage). Over the following year, Christian Rakovsky continued to attempt a \"détente\" with France, advertising Soviet concessions and speaking directly to the public.\n\nDuring the same period, as tensions grew between Mexico and the Soviet government over the latter's support for a Mexican railway workers' strike, American agents reported that Rakovsky was instructed to threaten with publicizing correspondence between former President Álvaro Obregón and Soviet authorities (which had occurred before diplomatic links were established). Since this could endanger Mexico's relations with the United States, President Plutarco Elías Calles chose to deescalate the conflict.\nTogether with his second wife, Rakovsky gave full approval to Max Eastman's volume \"Since Lenin Died\", which centered on heavy criticism of Soviet realities, and which they reviewed before it was published. He became acquainted with the former French Communist Party member and anti-Stalinist journalist Boris Souvarine, as well as with the Romanian writer Panait Istrati, who had observed Rakovsky's career ever since his presence in Romania. He also maintained friendly contacts with Marcel Pauker, a prominent but independent-minded member of the Romanian Communist Party, whose activities were denounced by the Comintern in 1930.\n\nRakovsky was eventually declared a \"persona non grata\" in France and recalled after signing the \"Declaration of the Opposition\", a Trotskyist platform deemed unfriendly by the French government (it stressed support for revolutions and mutinies in all capitalist countries). According to \"Time\", France's decision was tacitly welcomed by Foreign Affairs Commissar Georgy Chicherin, due to Rakovsky's political opinions. Rakovsky left without presenting his letter of recall to President Doumergue, although he was scheduled for a meeting at the Élysée. He was initially scheduled to serve as Ambassador to Japan. On his trip back to the Soviet state, he was joined by Istrati, who, partly owing to his witnessing of the Rakovsky's downfall, soon became a noted opponent of Stalinism.\n\nIn December, Rakovsky and Lev Kamenev held brief speeches in front of the Soviet Communist Party's Fifteenth Congress. The former was interrupted fifty-seven times by his opponents—Nikolai Bukharin, Martemyan Ryutin, and Lazar Kaganovich. Although, unlike Rakovsky, he used the occasion to appeal for reconciliation, Kamenev was himself interrupted twenty-four times by the same group.\n\nAfter that moment, although branded \"enemy of the people\", Rakovsky was still occasionally allowed to speak in public (notably, together with Kamenev and Karl Radek, to the Moscow Komsomol), and continued to criticize Stalin's leadership as \"bureaucratic socialism\" (\"see Bureaucratic collectivism\") and \"social fascism\". With Nikolai Krestinsky (who split with the group soon afterwards) and Kamenev, he attempted to organize a substantial opposition, visiting Ukraine for this purpose, hosting public meetings and printing manifestos addressed to the workers in Kiev, Kharkiv, Mykolaiv, Odessa, Dnipropetrovsk, Kherson, and Zaporizhia (he was assisted by, among others, Yuri Kotsubinsky). He was persistently heckled during public appearances, and his supporters were beaten up by the \"Militsiya\".\n\nIn November 1927, after receiving news that Adolph Joffe had committed suicide, he assigned Ukrainian campaigning to Voja Vujović, and returned to Moscow. Following the defeat of the Left Opposition in November–December 1927, Rakovsky was ousted from the Comintern, the Central Committee, and eventually from the Communist Party of the Soviet Union. He was exiled, first to Astrakhan, Saratov, and then to Barnaul. Shortly before the decision, he commented to his visitor, French writer Pierre Naville: \"The French expelled me from Paris for having signed a declaration of the opposition. Stalin expelled me from the [Foreign Affairs Commissariat] for having signed the same declaration. But in both cases they let me keep the jacket\".\n\nWhile in Astrakhan, Rakovsky was employed by the Regional Planning Committee (\"Gubplan\"). He was also active as a writer, starting work on a volume detailing the sources of Utopian socialism and the thought of Saint-Simon. Rakovsky remained involved in Trotskyist politics, was contacted by Panait Istrati and the Greek writer Nikos Kazantzakis, and corresponded with Trotsky (who had himself been exiled to Almaty). Most of his writings were confiscated by the State Political Directorate, but the letter on Soviet \"bureaucratism\" he addressed to Nikolai Valentinov survived, and became notorious as a critique of Stalinism (under the title \"\"Professional Dangers\" of Power\"). Mistrusting Stalin's new leftist policies, he foresaw the renewed moves against the Left Opposition (inaugurated by Trotsky's 1929 expulsion).\n\nAs his health deteriorated, he was allowed to move to Saratov upon requests addressed by Krestinsky to Kaganovich, the Secretary of the Central Committee. He was visited by Louis Fischer, who recorded Rakovsky's determination not to submit to Stalin (contrasting his option with those of Radek, Yevgeni Preobrazhensky, Alexander Beloborodov and Ivar Smilga). Instead, Rakovsky incited further resistance to Stalinism, and issued a declaration of the united opposition; following this, he was sent to Barnaul, which he called a \"hole in the barren cold ground\". In another critical letter to the Party leadership (April 1930), he called for, among other things, the restoration of civil liberties, a reduction in the party apparatus, the return of Trotsky, and an end to forced collectivization.\n\nLittle is known of Rakovsky's life between that moment and July 1932, the moment when he was allowed a medical leave. Towards the end of the same year, Trotsky was informed that he had attempted to flee the Soviet Union, and, in March 1933, it was announced that he had been deported to Yakutia. Answering Trotsky's request, the French mathematician and Trotskyist Jean Van Heijenoort, together with his fellow activist Pierre Frank, unsuccessfully called on the influential Soviet author Maxim Gorky to intervene in favor of Christian Rakovsky, and boarded the ship he was traveling on near Istanbul. According to Heijenoort, they only managed to meet Gorky's son, Maxim Peshkov, who reportedly told them that his father was indisposed, but promised to pass on their request. Researcher Tova Yedlin proposed that the problem was caused by Gorky's distress over having recently separated from his mistress Moura Budberg, as well as to the writer's close surveillance by OGPU agents.\n\nRakovsky was one of the last leading Trotskyists to break with Trotsky and surrender to Stalin. Alarmed by Adolf Hitler's rise to power in Germany and under intense pressure from Stalin, he announced his submission to the Party through a telegram he sent \"Izvestia\" (February 23, 1934). While Rakovsky was allowed to return to Moscow, Trotsky declared the dissociation statement to be \"purely formal\".\n\nRakovsky formally \"admitted his mistakes\" in April 1934 (his letter to the \"Pravda\", titled \"There Should Be No Mercy\", depicted Trotsky and his supporters as \"agents of the German Gestapo\"). He was appointed to high office in the Commissariat for Health and allowed to return to Moscow, also serving as Soviet ambassador to Japan in 1935.\n\nCited in allegations involving the killing of Sergey Kirov, Rakovsky was arrested in autumn 1937, during the Great Purge; according to Trotsky, he was forced to wait without food or rest for 18 hours, during which time his house was being searched.\n\nShortly thereafter, in March 1938, he was put on trial along with Nikolai Bukharin, Alexei Rykov, Genrikh Yagoda, Nikolai Krestinsky and other Old Bolsheviks, on charges of conspiring with Trotsky to overthrow Stalin, the third Moscow Show Trial—known as the Trial of the Twenty One. In his forced confession to Andrey Vyshinsky, he admitted to all the charges—including having been a spy (for Japan) and a landowner. He made attempts to point out that his revenue had been used to support socialism, and that he had a grasp of \"revolutionary practices\", but was attacked by Vyshinsky, who persistently referred to Rakovsky as \"a counterrevolutionary\". In his final statement, Rakovsky argued: \"from my young days I honestly, truthfully and devotedly performed my duty as a soldier of the cause of the emancipation of labor. After this bright period a dark period set in, the period of my criminal deeds\".\n\nUnlike most of his co-defendants, who were immediately executed, he was sentenced to twenty years of hard labor. In 1941 he was in Oryol Prison. After the Nazi invasion of the Soviet Union (Operation Barbarossa), Rakovsky was shot on Stalin's orders outside Oryol—along with Olga Kameneva, Maria Spiridonova and over 150 other political prisoners in the Medvedev Forest massacre. This execution was one of the many massacres of prisoners committed by the NKVD in 1941.\n\nRakovsky's second wife, Alexandrina Alexandrescu, was herself arrested, and is known to have been held in Butyrka prison, where she suffered a series of heart attacks. His adoptive daughter, Elena Codreanu-Racovski, was expelled from her job as secretary of the Mossoviet Theater, and deported to Siberia. She returned to Moscow in the 1950s, after Stalin's death, and settled in Communist Romania after 1975, rejoining her brother, the biologist and academic Radu Codreanu. She later authored a memoir which included recollections of her father (it was published in Romanian as \"De-a lungul şi de-a latul secolului\", \"The Length and Breadth of the Century\"). It was compiled from personal notes and dialogs with physician and former communist militant G. Brătescu, who noted that, probably owing to suspicions she had in respect to the Romanian communist regime, Elena Codreanu refused to talk about Rakovsky's trial and her own persecution. Rakovsky's nephew Boris Stefanov, whom he encouraged to join the Romanian socialist movement before World War I, later became a general secretary of the Romanian Communist Party, before being himself purged in 1940.\n\nBy 1932, Rakovsky's name was frequently invoked in the heated debate involving Panait Istrati and his political adversaries. Istrati, having returned to Romania in disillusion over Soviet realities, was initially attacked in the local right-wing newspapers \"Curentul\" and \"Universul\"; writing for the former, Pamfil Şeicaru defined Istrati as \"the servant of Racovski\". Having published \"To the Other Flame\", in which he exposed Stalinism, he consequently became the target of intense criticism and allegations from various pro-Soviet writers, led by the Frenchman Henri Barbusse. During this period, the Romanian communist writer Alexandru Sahia speculated, among other things, that Istrati had been in the pay of Rakovsky and Trotsky for a sizable part of his life.\n\nBased on his independent opinions and, in part, on his friendship with Rakovsky, Marcel Pauker was disavowed by the Romanian and Soviet communist parties, and was himself a victim of the Great Purge in 1938. At various intervals between 1930 and 1952, his wife, the Romanian communist leader Ana Pauker, faced pressures to denounce her husband. She allegedly refused to criticize him for anything other than his association with Rakovsky, and to admit that Marcel Pauker had been guilty of all the charges brought against him.\n\nThe Hungarian-born author Arthur Koestler, himself a former communist, based Rubashov, the main character in his 1940 novel \"Darkness at Noon\", on victims of the Moscow Trials; according to George Orwell, Rakovsky's fate was a possible direct influence: \"Rubashov might be called Trotsky, Bukharin, Rakovsky or some other relatively civilised figure among the Old Bolsheviks. If one writes about the Moscow trials one must answer the question, «Why did the accused confess?» and which answer one makes is a political decision. Koestler answers, in effect, «Because these people had been rotted by the Revolution which they served», and in doing so he comes near to claiming that revolutions are of their nature bad\".\n\nIn 1988, during \"Glasnost\", the Soviet government cleared Rakovsky and his co-defendants of all charges. His rehabilitation came in February, coinciding with that of Bukharin, as well as with those of Ukrainian official and former People's Commissar for Agriculture Mikhail Alexandrovich Chernov, former People's Commissar for Foreign Trade Arkady Rosengolts, and other five officials. Bukharin, Rakovsky, Rozengolts, and Chernov were posthumously reinstated to the Communist Party on June 21, 1988. His works were given \"imprimatur\", while a favorable biography was published by the Ukrainian Academy of Sciences (late 1988).\n\n\n"}

Mimi (10 March 1868 – 17 April 1935) was a Bessarabian politician and winemaker, whose family was originally from Albania.\n\nHe graduated from Odessa State University and SupAgro (Montpellier).\n\nWhen the February Revolution happened in Petrograd in 1917, the governor of Bessarabia Governorate stepped down and passed his legal powers to Constantin Mimi, the President of the Gubernial Zemstvo, which was named \"the Commissar of the Provisional Government in Bessarabia\", with Vladimir Criste his deputy. Similar procedures took place in all regions of the Russian Empire: the chiefs of the Tsarist administrations passed their legal powers to the chiefs of the County and Governorate Zemstvos, which were then called \"County/Governorate Commissars\".\n\nOn , Constantin Mimi, the official Commissar of the Russian Provisional Government (of Kerenski) in Chişinău, gathered delegates of all major political, national, professional and administrative organizations to a \"delegation\" to protest and reject the pretensions of the \"Ukrainian Central Rada\" to annex Bessarabia.\n\nThe Peasants Congress, which took place in October 1917, voted Constantin Mimi out and Ion Inculeţ as the new Commissar. This move was planned by Alexander Kerenski, who sent Inculeţ, an associate professor at the University of Petrograd, to Bessarabia to take hold of the situation. As soon as the Peasants Congress, which had no legal power, voted, Kerenski formally replaced Mimi with Inculeţ.\n\nAfter the Union of Bessarabia with Romania, Constantin Mimi moved to Bucharest and became the director of the National Bank of Romania.\n\n"}
{"id": "1896897", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1896897", "title": "Contactee", "text": "Contactee\n\nContactees are persons who claim to have experienced contact with extraterrestrials. Some claimed ongoing encounters, while others claimed to have had as few as a single encounter. Evidence is anecdotal in all cases.\n\nAs a cultural phenomenon, contactees perhaps had their greatest notoriety from the late 1940s to the late 1950s, but individuals continue to make similar claims in the present. Some have shared their messages with small groups of followers, and many have issued newsletters or spoken at UFO conventions.\n\nThe contactee movement has seen serious attention from academics and mainstream scholars. Among the earliest was the classic 1956 study, \"When Prophecy Fails\" by Leon Festinger, Henry Riecken, and Stanley Schachter, which analyzed the phenomenon. There have been at least two university-level anthologies of scientific papers regarding the contactee movements (see sources below).\n\nContactee accounts are generally different from those who allege alien abduction, in that while contactees usually describe beneficial experiences involving human-like aliens, abductees rarely describe their experiences positively.\n\nAstronomer J. Allen Hynek described contactees as asserting \"the visitation to the earth of generally benign beings whose ostensible purpose is to communicate (generally to a relatively few selected and favored persons —) messages of 'cosmic importance'. These chosen recipients generally have repeated contact experiences, involving additional messages...\"\n\nContactees became a cultural phenomenon in the 1940s and continued throughout the 1950s and 1960s, often giving lectures and writing books about their experience. The phenomenon still exists today. Skeptics hold that such 'contactees' are deluded or dishonest in their claims. Susan Clancy wrote that such claims are \"false memories\" concocted out of a \"blend of fantasy-proneness, memory distortion, culturally available scripts, sleep hallucinations, and scientific illiteracy\".\n\nContactees usually portrayed \"Space Brothers\" as more or less identical in appearance and mannerisms to humans. The Brothers are also almost invariably reported as disturbed by the violence, crime and wars that infest the earth, and by the possession of various earth nations of nuclear and thermonuclear weapons.\nCurtis Peebles summarizes the common features of many contactee claims:\n\n\nThough the word \"contactee\" was not in common use until the 1950s, the authors of the anthologies noted in \"sources\" below use the term to describe persons whose claims occurred centuries before the UFO era, attempting to depict them as a part of the same tradition.\n\nThough not linked to flying saucers or odd aerial lights, it is perhaps worth noting that there is a long history of claims of contact with non-earthly intelligences. The founding revelations of many of the world's religions involve contact between the founder and a supernatural source of wisdom, such as a god in human form or an angel. In this context, it might be expected that most of the 1950s contactees would form their own religions, with the contactee as sole spiritual leader, and that is just what happened, almost invariably.\n\nAs early as the 18th century, people like Emanuel Swedenborg were claiming to be in psychic contact with inhabitants of other planets. 1758 saw the publication of \"Concerning Earths in the Solar System\", in which Swedenborg detailed his alleged journeys to the inhabited planets. J. Gordon Melton notes that Swedenborg's planetary tour stops at Saturn, the furthest planet known during Swedenborg's era — he did not visit Uranus, Neptune or Pluto.\n\nLater, Helena Blavatsky would make claims similar to Swedenborg's.\n\nIn 1891, Thomas Blott's book \"The Man From Mars\" was published. The author claimed to have met a Martian in Kentucky. Unusually for an early contactee, Blott reported that the Martian communicated not via telepathy, but in English.\n\nAnother early contactee book, of sorts, was \"From India To The Planet Mars\" (1900) by Theodore Flournoy. Flournoy detailed the claims of Helene Smith, who, whilst in a trance, dictated information gleaned from her psychic visits to the planet Mars — including a Martian alphabet and language she could write and speak. Flournoy determined that Smith's claims were spurious, based on fantasy and imagination. Her \"Martian\" language was simply a garbled version of French.\n\nTwo of the earliest contactees in the modern sense were William Magoon and Guy Ballard (the latter a follower of Madame Blavatsky).\n\nMagoon's book \"William Magoon: Psychic and Healer\" was published in 1930. He claimed that, in the early 20th century, he had been unexpectedly and instantaneously transported to Mars. The planet was essentially earth-like, with cities and wilderness. The inhabitants had radio and automobiles. Though they were invisible, Magoon sensed their presences.\n\nThough Magoon was obscure, Ballard would have more impact via the I Am movement he established. In 1935, Ballard claimed that, several years earlier, he and over 100 others witnessed the appearance of 12 Venusians in a cavern beneath Mount Shasta. The Venusians played music for the audience, said Ballard, then showed the crowd a large mirror-like device that displayed images of life on Venus. The Venusians then allegedly reported that the earth would suffer through an era of tension and warfare, followed by worldwide peace and goodwill.\n\nGeorge Adamski, who later became probably the most prominent contactee of the UFO era, was one contactee with an earlier interest in the occult. Adamski founded the Royal Order of Tibet in the 1930s. Writes Michael Barkun, \"His [later] messages from the Venusians sounded suspiciously like his own earlier occult teachings.\"\n\nChristopher Partridge notes, importantly, that the pre-1947 contactees \"do not involve UFOs\". Rather, he suggests that an existing tradition of extraterrestrial contact via seances and psychic means promptly incorporated the flying-saucer mythos when it arrived.\n\nThe 1947 report of Kenneth Arnold sparked widespread interest in flying saucers, and before long, people were claiming to have been in contact with flying saucer inhabitants.\n\nThere was a nearly-continuous series of contactees, beginning with George Adamski in 1952. Radio host John Nebel interviewed many contactees on his program during this era. The stereotypical contactee account in these days involved not just conversations with friendly, human-appearing spacemen but visits inside their flying saucers, and rides to large \"Mother Ships\" in Earth orbit, and even jaunts to the Moon, Mars, Venus, Jupiter and Saturn.\n\nIn support of their claims, early 1950s contactees often produced photographs of the alleged flying saucers or their occupants. A number of photos of a \"Venusian scout ship\" by George Adamski and identified by him as a typical extraterrestrial flying saucer were noted to bear a suspicious resemblance to a type of once commonly available chicken egg incubator, complete with three light bulbs which Adamski said were \"landing gear\".\n\nFor over two decades, contactee George Van Tassel hosted the annual \"Giant Rock Interplanetary Spacecraft Convention\" in the Mojave Desert. Another 1950s contactee, Buck Nelson, held a similar convention in the Ozarks of Missouri up until 1965.\n\nEven in ufology—itself subject to at best very limited and sporadic mainstream scientific or academic interest—contactees were generally seen as the lunatic fringe, and \"serious\" ufologists subsequently avoided the subject, for fear it would harm their attempts at \"serious\" study of the UFO phenomenon. Jacques Vallée notes, \"No serious investigator has ever been very worried by the claims of the 'contactees'.\"\n\nCarl Sagan has expressed skepticism about contactees and alien contact in general, remarking that aliens seem very happy to answer vague questions but when confronted with specific, technical questions they are silent:\n\nOccasionally, by the way, I get a letter from someone who is in \"contact\" with an extraterrestrial who invites me to \"ask anything\". And so I have a list of questions. The extraterrestrials are very advanced, remember. So I ask things like, \"Please give a short proof of Fermat's Last Theorem.\" Or the Goldbach Conjecture. And then I have to explain what these are, because extraterrestrials will not call it Fermat's Last Theorem, so I write out the little equation with the exponents. I never get an answer. On the other hand, if I ask something like \"Should we humans be good?\" I always get an answer. I think something can be deduced from this differential ability to answer questions. Anything vague they are extremely happy to respond to, but anything specific, where there is a chance to find out if they actually know anything, there is only silence.\n\nSome time after the phenomenon had waned, Temple University historian David M. Jacobs noted a few interesting facts: the accounts of the prominent contactees grew ever more elaborate, and as new claimants gained notoriety, they typically backdated their first encounter, claiming it occurred earlier than anyone else's. Jacobs speculates that this was an attempt to gain a degree of \"authenticity\" to trump other contactees.\n\nThose who claim to be contactees include:\n\n\n"}

Born as Gordon Langley Hall, Simmons lived her first decades as a male. As a young adult, she became close to British actress Dame Margaret Rutherford, whom she considered an adoptive mother and who was the subject of a biography Simmons wrote in later years. After sex reassignment surgery in 1968, Simmons wed in the first legal interracial marriage in South Carolina.\n\nSimmons's parents were servants at Sissinghurst Castle, the English estate of biographer Harold Nicolson and his novelist wife, Vita Sackville-West. Simmons was born in Sussex as Gordon Langley Hall to Jack Copper, Vita Sackville-West's chauffeur, and another servant, Marjorie Hall Ticehurst, before they were married. Although she claimed to have been born with an unusual condition that resulted in the swelling of her genitals with the result that she was mistakenly identified as a boy, Charleston author Edward Ball's book \"Peninsula of Lies\" (2004) states that she was born male.\n\nAs a child, Simmons was raised by her grandmother and at one point visited the castle and met Virginia Woolf, Sackville-West's lover. Woolf made Sackville-West the subject of the novel \"\", which bears a striking resemblance to Simmons' own life story.\n\nIn 1946 Simmons emigrated to Canada. Still living as a man, she crewcut her hair and became a teacher on the Ojibway native reservation on Lake Nipigon, experiences from which were translated into the best-selling \"Me Papoose Sitter\" (1955)—the first of many published books.\n\nAfter a stint as an editor for the \"Winnipeg Free Press\", Simmons moved back to England in 1947, to teach theatre at the Gregg School in Croydon, Surrey. She moved to the United States in 1950, and became the society editor for the \"Nevada Daily Mail\" in Missouri before moving to New York and working as the society editor of the \"Port Chester Daily Item\". Shortly after moving to New York, Simmons met artist Isabel Whitney, beginning a friendship that would last until Whitney's death in 1962.\n\nDuring this time, Simmons began a prolific writing career, including a series of biographies which covered personalities such as Princess Margaret (1958), Jacqueline Kennedy (1964), Lady Bird Johnson (1967), and Mary Todd Lincoln (1970) among many more. While living in Whitney's New York townhouse in the 1950s, Simmons was introduced to Margaret Rutherford and her husband Stringer Davis. Rutherford, interested in meeting Simmons to discuss a role in a possible adaptation of \"Me Papoose Sitter\", became enamored with the young author and she and Davis agreed to serve as unofficial adoptive parents. Subsequently, Simmons and Whitney purchased a house in Charleston, South Carolina, though Whitney would die two weeks later, leaving Simmons the house and $2 million.\n\nThe mansion Simmons purchased with Whitney, was located in the Ansonborough neighbourhood of Charleston, a neighbourhood known for housing the city's queer elite. Simmons began restoring the house, and designed the interior with early American antiques and furniture by Thomas Chippendale. Her pursuit of Chippendale pieces brought her into contact with Edward Ball, a journalist who owned a Chippendale commode and who would later write a biography about her.\n\nIn her autobiographical books, Simmons said she was born intersex with ambiguous genitalia, as well as an internal uterus and ovaries, and was inappropriately assigned male at birth. Simmons underwent sex reassignment surgery at Johns Hopkins Hospital in 1968, carried out by Dr. Milton Edgerton. In Ball's \"Peninsula of Lies\", he disputes Simmons claim that she was intersex, suggesting instead that Simmons had male genitalia and was unable to bear children.\n\nSimmons legally changed her name to Dawn Pepita Langley Hall, and became engaged to John-Paul Simmons, then a young black motor mechanic with dreams of becoming a sculptor. Their marriage on 21 January 1969 was the first legal interracial marriage in South Carolina, and the ceremony was carried out in their drawing room reportedly after threats to bomb the church. After a second ceremony in England, the crate containing their wedding gifts was firebombed in Charleston, and Simmons received a ticket the next day when the charred remains were obstructing a sidewalk.\n\nOn 17 October 1971, her daughter, Natasha Margienell Manigault Paul Simmons, was born, in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. Ball claims to have been told by John-Paul Simmons that Natasha was his child from another relationship, although \"Natasha fervently believed Dawn was her mother\".\n\nAfter an intruder raped Simmons and broke her arm, the family moved to Catskill, New York.\n\nIn 1982, she divorced John-Paul Simmons, who had been abusive and suffered from schizophrenia. After spending several years in Hudson, New York, she moved in with her daughter and three grandchildren, who had returned to Charleston. In 1985, while back in Charleston, Simmons was featured as an extra in several scenes of ABC's miniseries \"North and South\".\n\nIn her final years, Simmons developed Parkinson's disease, and died at her daughter's home on 18 September 2000.\n\nIn the 1987 film \"Withnail and I\", set in 1969, the character Marwood reads a tabloid newspaper article about Gordon Langley Hall, entitled \"I Had to Become a Woman\". Author Jack Hitt profiled Simmons in a 1996 episode of \"This American Life\" titled \"Dawn\". Hitt, a native of Charleston, had grown up down the street from Simmons. From interviews, including with Simmons, Hitt assembled stories of her transsexuality, interracial marriages in the South, her rumoured voodoo powers, and rumoured hosting of a full-fledged debut for her chihuahua. Hitt expanded the piece for publication in the October 1998 \"GQ\".\n"}

He was a graduate of Anderson's University in Glasgow (now the University of Strathclyde), and Yorkshire College, Leeds (now the University of Leeds). He formed the intellectual property firm with George Croydon Marks, called Marks & Clerk. He was knighted on 24 August 1917.\n\nDugald Clerk was born in Glasgow on 31 March 1854, the son of Donald Clerk a machinist and his wife, Martha Symington. He was privately tutored then apprenticed to the firm of Messrs H O Robinson & Co in Glasgow. From 1871 to 1876 he went to Anderson College in Glasgow studying engineering then to the Yorkshire College of Science in Leeds. In the First World War he was Director of Engineering Research for the Admiralty.\n\nHe married Margaret Hanney in 1883.\n\nHe died in Ewhurst, Surrey on 12 November 1932.\n\nClerk began work on his own engine designs in October 1878 after modifying a Brayton engine with a spark plug. George Brayton. Brayton engines ( called \"Ready Motors\" were made from 1872 - 1876) and were one of the first engines to successfully use compression and combust fuel in the cylinder. Prior to this time the commercial engines available had been the Lenoir engine from 1860, a non - compression engine which worked on a double-acting two-stroke cycle, but spent half of each stroke drawing gas into the cylinder. The Hugon engine was a slightly improved version, but both were quite inefficient (95 and 85 cubic feet of gas per HP hour respectively). The next commercial engine available (from 1867) was the Otto & Langen a non compression, free piston engine, which used atmospheric pressure for the power stroke, and consumed about half the gas of the Lenoir and Hugon engines. It was in May 1876 that Otto developed his engine using the single-acting four-stroke cycle with compression in the cylinder. Clerk decided to develop an engine using compression, but with the two-stroke cycle, as he could see benefit to weight and smoothness of operation through having twice as many power strokes.\n\nClerk's initial experiment with a Brayton ready motor in 1878 led him to make improvements that would eventually result in the development of the two-stroke cycle. Clerks engine used compression and a novel system of ignition\", one of these was exhibited in July 1879. However it was not until the end of 1880 that he succeeded in producing the Clerk engine operating on the two-stroke cycle, which became the commercial product. Clerk states \"The Clerk engine at present in the market was the first to succeed in introducing compression of this type, combined with ignition at every revolution ; many attempts had previously been made by other inventors, including Mr. Otto and the Messrs. Crossley, but all had failed in producing a marketable engine. It is only recently that the Messrs. Crossley have made the Otto engine in its twin form and so succeeded in getting impulse at every turn.\"\n\nDugald Clerk was the author of 3 comprehensive books covering the development of the oil and gas engine from its early inception, and including details of his own work in this area. The first edition was produced in 1886, and the notes here are taken from the 7th edition, revised and updated up to 1896.\nIn \"Gas and Oil Engines\", Clerk refers to the significant earlier gas engine patents of Barnett in 1838 and Wright in 1833.\n\nIn 1878 Clerk obtained a Brayton \"Ready Motor\" engine made from 1872-1876 by George Brayton in Philadelphia PA USA. Clerk wondered if he could improve the performance of the engine. He soon outfitted the engine with a spark plug and an improved fuel system. Initially Clerk used one cylinder for compression and the other for expansion. At one point an explosion occurred which broke the engine in two pieces. The engine was repaired and displayed in 1879. Later Clerk decided to abandon use of the pumping cylinder for compression and use it only to transfer the air / fuel mixture into the power cylinder.\n\nClerk describes a Cambell engine as using his cycle, as follows: \"It has two cylinders, respectively pump and motor, driven from cranks placed at almost right angles to each other, the pump crank leading. The pump takes in a charge of gas and air, and the motor piston overruns a port in the side of the cylinder at the out-end of its stroke to discharge the exhaust gases. When the pressure in the motor cylinder has fallen to atmosphere, the pump forces its charge into the back cover of the motor cylinder through a check valve, displacing before it the products of combustion through an exhaust port ; the motor piston then returns, compressing the contents of the cylinder into the compression space. The charge is then fired and the piston performs its working stroke. This is the Clerk cycle.\"\n\nThe Clerk engine uses automatic 'poppet' type valves for inlet air and gas (one with spring assistance, one without), and a port in the cylinder uncovered by the piston for the exhaust valve. References to a Clerk engine with slide valve may refer to the earlier experiments with a Lenoir type engine. The ignition is by carrying an external flame, using a modification of a method he developed in 1878.\n\nMost engine designs that pre-dated the Otto engine (and Clerk engine), such as those of de Rivaz, the Niépce brothers, Jean Joseph Etienne Lenoir, Samuel Morey, and others, did use two-stroke engines, which were \"natural\" in the times of steam engine. Clerk's significant contribution was introducing Otto-styled compression to the two-stroke engine, bringing its efficiency up-to-date (for the 1880s). Several manufacturers adopted the Clerk cycle in the short term, though commercial aspects such as patents on the four-stroke cycle were part of this. Many years later the two-stroke engine for large capacity diesels using a turbocharger or supercharger has become common, for example in ships and railway locomotives. With open crankshafts, and the advantages of higher power to weight ratio, these engines are closely aligned with Dugald Clerk's concepts, and the Clerk Cycle.\n\nClerk's engine was made of two cylinders – one working cylinder and an additional cylinder to charge the cylinder, expelling the exhaust through a port uncovered by the piston. Some sources consider this additional cylinder the world's first supercharger. Clerk himself states that \"It is not a compressing\npump, and is not intended to compress before introduction into the motor, but merely to exercise force enough to pass the gases through the lift valve into the motor cylinder, and there displace the burnt gases, discharging them into the exhaust pipe.\" Hence sources recognise it instead as a \"pumping cylinder\", pointing out that it did not actually compress the fuel-air mixture, it simply moved the fresh mixture to the working cylinder to force out the gasses burnt previously.\n\nClerk's original design did not allow the construction of smaller engines, as it required the aforementioned additional pumping cylinder for each working cylinder. The crucial simplification of the concept, that made possible small yet powerful two-stroke engines for mass markets, was patented by Joseph Day in 1894.\n\n\n"}

Francis was educated at Liskeard Grammar School and at Exeter College, Oxford, where he took the degree of M.A. in 1809, and after having been ordained in the Church of England he took a curacy at Antony in his native county.\n\nFrom youth to old age Arundell was imbued with a love of antiquarian study, and after his institution in 1805 to the rectory of Landulph on the banks of the Tamar, he threw himself with avidity into the history of Cornwall. When Nicholas Condy, an artist at Plymouth, published a series of views of Cotehele, the ancient seat of Lord Mount Edgcumbe, Arundell supplied the description of the house which accompanied them. He was elected a Fellow of the Society of Antiquaries of London in 1811, but removed from the fellowship in 1845, for being 28 years behind in his subscription.\n\nIn the church of Landulph is a brass to the memory of Theodoro Palaeologus, descended from the last of the Byzantine emperors, who died on 21 January 1637, and an account of this inscription, and of the person whom it commemorated, was printed by Jago in the volume of the \"Archæologia\" for 1817, and reprinted in Davies Gilbert's \"Cornwall\" (iii, 365). This paper was afterwards amplified into \"Some Notice of the Church of Landulph,\" which was published in 1840, and a reprint of which, with additions by Joseph Polsue of Bodmin, was announced some years ago (i.e. before 1885).\n\nOne of Arundell's ancestors married a co-heiress of John Arundell of Trevarnoe, and Jago assumed that name in addition to his own on 25 February 1815. Next year (17 October) he married Anna Maria, second daughter of Isaac Morier, consul-general at Constantinople, and sister of James Morier, the author of \"Hajji Baba\".\n\nAfter this marriage, Arundell turned his thoughts towards the East, and became in 1822 the chaplain to the British factory at Smyrna, where he remained for fourteen years. With characteristic energy he began, very soon after settling at Smyrna, to arrange a tour of exploration in Asia Minor. The months from March to September 1826 were spent in a pilgrimage to the seven churches of Asia and an excursion into Pisidia, a narrative of which was issued in 1828. This book was very favourably received.\n\nEncouraged by his published success, Arundell ventured in 1833 upon another tour of 1,000 miles through districts the greater part of which had hitherto not been described by any European traveller, when he made an especial study of the ruins of Antioch in Pisidia. Two volumes describing these discoveries were published in 1834. Although he made a third tour in 1835 and 1836 through Palestine, no account of his travels was published.\n\nWhilst residing at Smyrna, Arundell made large collections of antiquities, coins, and manuscripts; on his return to England the coins were sold to the British Museum. He gave great assistance to the brothers Lysons in their history of Cornwall, and at one time contemplated the publication of a history of that county on his own account. It has even been said that some plates were engraved for it. The materials which he collected for histories of Smyrna and of his native town of Launceston were never used, and are probably lost. He died at Landulph on 5 December 1846, and was buried in its church, not far from the tomb of Palæologus. His widow died in Osnaburgh Street, London, on 2 June 1869, aged 80.\n\n\n"}

He was Department Chairman from 1964 to 1982 and retired from teaching in 1992.\n\nChallenged to explain sightings of unidentified lights and luminous phenomena in the sky around Piedmont, Missouri, Rutledge decided to subject these reports to scientific analysis. He put together a team of observers with college training in the physical sciences, including a large array of equipment: RF spectrum analyzers, Questar telescopes, low-high frequency audio detectors, electromagnetic frequency analyzer, cameras, and a galvanometer to measure variations in the Earth's gravitational field.\n\nThe resulting Project Identification commenced in April 1973, logging several hundred hours of observation time. This was the first UFO scientific field study, able to monitor the phenomena in real-time, enabling Rutledge to calculate the objects' actual velocity, course, position, distance, and size.\n\nObservation of the unclouded night sky often revealed \"pseudostars\" - stationary lights camouflaged by familiar constellations. Some objects appeared to mimic the appearance of known aircraft; others violated the laws of physics. The most startling discovery was that on at least 32 recorded occasions, the movement of the lights synchronized with actions of the observers. They appeared to respond to a light being switched on and off, and to verbal or radio messages.

On his father's side, he descended from Alexander Crookshank, of County Longford, Ireland, who represented Belfast in the Irish House of Commons and served as a Justice of the Court of Common Pleas in Ireland. He was educated at Eton and Magdalen College, Oxford. In the First World War, he joined the Hampshire Regiment and served as a captain in the Grenadier Guards. On one occasion he was buried alive by an explosion for twenty minutes, and on another in 1916 he was castrated by shrapnel, requiring him to wear a surgical truss for the rest of his life. He was awarded by Serbia the Order of the White Eagle and Gold Medal for Valour.\n\nHe joined the Diplomatic Service in 1919 and worked at the British Embassy in Washington, D.C. until 1924.\n\nCrookshank was elected Member of Parliament (MP) for Gainsborough in 1924, a seat he held for the next 32 years. He entered the government as Under-Secretary of State for the Home Department in 1934 under Ramsay MacDonald.

In the latter year, he was sworn of the Privy Council and made Financial Secretary to the Treasury. He continued in this post also when Winston Churchill came to power in 1940, and was then Postmaster General under Churchill between 1943 and 1945.\n\nWhen the Conservatives returned to office under Churchill in 1951, Crookshank was appointed Minister of Health and Leader of the House of Commons, with a seat in the cabinet. In 1952 exchanged his post at the Ministry of Health for the sinecure post of Lord Privy Seal, while he remained as Commons Leader. He continued in these two positions until December 1955, the last year under the premiership of Sir Anthony Eden. In the 1955 New Year Honours he was made a Companion of Honour. He retired from the House of Commons in 1956 and was raised to the peerage as the Viscount Crookshank, of Gainsborough in the County of Lincoln, in January of that year. He had been offered a peerage by Churchill in February 1940 but considered it at the time an insult as his First World War wounds had left him incapable of fathering any heir to a title.\n\nPapers released by The National Archives, London, November 2007, show that Crookshank, with Harold Macmillan, led a faction within the Cabinet of Sir Winston Churchill's government, who opposed what they perceived to be an attempt to bounce the Cabinet into a premature decision to authorise a British thermonuclear bomb programme in July 1954.\n\nLord Crookshank was a 33rd degree Freemason.\n\nIncapable as result of his First World War wounds of fathering children, Crookshank was a lifelong bachelor. He was also (not publicly) known as a homosexual and caused a near scandal when a male lover of his was adopted as Conservative candidate for the Grimsby constituency in 1958 but later withdrawn.\n\nHis home from 1937 was at 51 Pont Street, Kensington, London, where in 1947 he hosted a meeting of like-minded backbench MPs who unsuccessfully demanded Churchill's removal as Conservative Party leader.\n\nHe died of cancer at Chelsea, London, in October 1961, aged 68.

His \"Mr Majeika\" series of children's books enjoyed considerable popularity and were successfully adapted for television. \"The Joshers: Or London to Birmingham with Albert and Victoria\" (1977) is a children's adventure book, similar in style to \"The Railway Children\" and based on the adventure of taking a working narrowboat up the Grand Union Canal from London to Birmingham. His encyclopaedic work \"The Oxford Companion to Children's Literature\" (1984), written jointly with his wife, has become a standard reference source.\n\nA distinguished broadcaster, he began his career at BBC Radio Oxford as a presenter and producer where he met his future wife, Mari Prichard (whose father was Caradog Prichard, the Welsh novelist and poet); they married in 1973. They jointly produced \"A Thames Companion\" in 1975. He played a role in launching Radio 3's arts discussion programme \"Night Waves\" and acted as a regular presenter of other programmes on the network including Radio 3's afternoon drivetime programme \"In Tune\" and, until it was discontinued, its Sunday request programme \"Listeners' Choice\". Until the time of his death, he presented the BBC Radio 4 biography series \"Great Lives\" recorded in Bristol. The last edition recorded before his death featured an interview with the singer Eddi Reader about the poet Robert Burns, the major focus of her creative work. BBC Radio 4 broadcast this programme on New Year's Eve, 2004.\n\nCarpenter's other abilities included being a talented amateur jazz musician and an accomplished player of the piano, the saxophone, and the double-bass, playing the last instrument professionally in a dance band in the 1970s. In 1983, he formed a 1930s style jazz band, Vile Bodies, which for many years enjoyed a residency at the Ritz Hotel in London. He also founded the Mushy Pea Theatre Group, a children's drama group based in Oxford, which premiered his \"Mr Majeika: The Musical\" in 1991 and \"Babes\", a musical about Hollywood child stars.\n\nHis death was the result of heart failure, compounded by the Parkinson's disease from which he had suffered for several years. A commemorative stained glass window has been installed in St. Margaret's Institute, Polstead Road honouring Carpenter's many accomplishments. He is survived by his wife, and daughters Clare and Kate.\n\n"}

Domengeaux, known as Jimmy Domengeaux (January 6, 1907 – April 11, 1988), was a lawyer from Lafayette, Louisiana, who served in the United States House of Representatives for Louisiana's 3rd congressional district from 1941 to 1949. He was a Cajun cultural activist who is best remembered for his efforts to preserve the French language in his native state.\n\nDomengeaux was born in Lafayette to J. Rudolph Domengeaux and the former Marthe Mouton. He attended Mount Carmel Academy and Cathedral High School in Lafayette. He obtained his undergraduate degree from the University of Louisiana at Lafayette (then \"Southwestern Louisiana Institute\"). He also studied in New Orleans at both Loyola University and Tulane University Law School, from which he received his legal degree in 1931. He was admitted to the bar that same year and launched his law practice in Lafayette.\n\nIn 1962, Domengeaux was admitted to practice before the United States Supreme Court. He was senior member of Domengeaux and Wright (1931–1984). The firm maintained offices in Lafayette, New Orleans, Hammond in Tangipahoa Parish, and Opelousas, the seat of St. Landry Parish in south central Louisiana.\n\nDomengeaux was married to the former Eleanor St. Julien (1921–2004); they had no children. They are interred at St. John's Cemetery in Lafayette.\n\nHe was a member, briefly, of the Louisiana House of Representatives in 1940, until he was elected as a Democrat to the U.S. House. He defeated the Republican sugar planter, David W. Pipes, Jr., of Terrebonne Parish. Domengeaux first served in the U.S. House from 1941 to April 15, 1944, when he resigned to join the armed forces. He was a private in the Combat Engineers until he received a medical discharge. Thereafter, he was elected on November 7, 1944, to fill the vacancy in the 78th Congress caused by his own resignation. He hence served again from 1944 to 1949. Domengeaux did not seek reelection to Congress in 1948; instead he ran unsuccessfully for the U.S. Senate in a race ultimately won by Russell B. Long, son of the legendary Huey Pierce Long, Jr. He was succeeded in the House by the freshman State Senator Edwin E. Willis of St. Martinville, the seat of St. Martin Parish. He returned to the private practice of law in 1949.\n\nIn 1968 Domengeaux accepted an appointment from Louisiana Governor John McKeithen, his fellow Democrat, to preside over a new state-charted organization called the Council for the Development of French in Louisiana, commonly known by the acronym CODOFIL.\n\nAs president of CODOFIL, Domengeaux spearheaded a statewide effort to introduce French education in public classrooms from elementary through high school levels. He did so largely by recruiting teachers from France, Belgium, Quebec, and other French-speaking regions and nations around the world. Such recruitment placed Domengeaux at odds with the educational establishment, which preferred the hiring of local teachers.\n\nThis effort represented a major shift for Louisiana's educational system, which for decades had punished Cajun children for speaking French in school — a practice that more than any other factor had dramatically reduced the number of native French speakers in the state.\n\nIn 1976, Domengeaux arranged for the then French President Valéry Giscard d'Estaing to visit Lafayette.\n\nIn the 1980s, Domengeaux embraced a new teaching method: French immersion, in which children were to be taught a variety of subjects in French for 60 percent of the school day. This method replaced the previous, less successful method of teaching French in only thirty-minute daily increments.\n\nIn addition to advancing French education, Domengeaux used CODOFIL as a watchdog organization that defended Cajuns from perceived affronts. For example, Domengeaux crusaded against use of the word \"coonass,\" which he considered an ethnic slur against the Cajun people; and he condemned such Cajun humorists as the popular Justin Wilson, who was born not in Acadiana, but in Tangipahoa Parish, one of the \"Florida Parishes\" east of Baton Rouge, and who disagreed with Domengeaux politically.\n\nA charismatic public figure, Domengeaux was often at odds with detractors, who criticized his reliance on international teachers as well as his emphasis on continental French to the exclusion of Cajun French.\n\nFor his efforts to save the French language in Louisiana, Domengeaux received an honorary doctorate from Louisiana State University in Baton Rouge, the Order of the Legion of Honor from the French government, and the Order of the Crown from Belgium, among numerous other citations. On November 11, 1986, coinciding with Veterans Day, Lafayette Mayor William Dudley \"Dud\" Lastrapes and Governor Edwin Washington Edwards proclaimed \"Jimmy Domengeaux Day\". The University of Louisiana at Lafayette created an \"Eminent Scholar Chair in Foreign Languages\" in Domengeaux's honor.\n\nThe organization over which Domengeaux presided for the last two decades of his life, CODOFIL, continues to coordinate French education in Louisiana; and in his honor CODOFIL's supporting foundation offers a scholarship known as the \"Bourse James Domengeaux\" (James Domengeaux Scholarship).\n\n"}

He lied about his age to join the British Army during World War I aged just 14, serving for four years in the infantry before being honourably discharged in 1918. After the War he attended the University of Liverpool financed by a government grant and where he took his BA in 1922 before attending Durham University for a year where he studied Psychoanalysis and took a Certificate in Education in 1923. In 1924 he married Charis Weare Grundy (1895/6–1975), a teacher and the daughter of James Grundy, a clergyman from Chicago, and with her he had one child, the author Brigid Brophy.\n\nAfter leaving university Brophy taught at a school in Cairo for two years in the 1920s before his wife's ill health forced him to return to England. His wife later wrote of her time in Egypt in her book \"Egyptian Portrait\" (c1930). Brophy later worked in a general store and as an advertising copywriter before becoming a full-time author, publishing his first novel, \"The Bitter End\", in 1928, and going on to write about 40 books, mostly based on his experiences as a soldier in the British Army during World War I. These included \"Pluck the Flower\" and \"Paul Lavelle\" (1929), as well as an anthology, \"The Soldier's War\". In 1930 with Eric Partridge he edited \"Songs and Slang of the British Soldier, 1914–1918\" (in 1965 revised as \"The Long Trail\"). Through the 1930s he published at least one novel a year but it was not until 1939 that he had a real success, with his fictional life of William Shakespeare, \"Gentleman of Stratford\".\n\nBrophy was also a critic for various London newspapers and magazines including \"The Daily Telegraph\" and \"Time and Tide\" as well as for the BBC. He was the editor of \"John O'London's Weekly\" from 1940 to 1943 and during World War II he served in the Home Guard, for which he wrote handbooks and manuals and published the 'character study' \"Britain's Home Guard\" in 1945, which was illustrated by Eric Kennington. During the war years Brophy produced an 'entertainment' called \"Solitude Island\" (1941) and wrote war novels including \"Immortal Sergeant\" (1942), made into the 1943 film of the same name starring Henry Fonda; \"Spear Head\" (published in the United States as \"Spearhead\", 1943) and \"Target Island\" (1944).\n\nBrophy's later works included books on art such as \"The Human Face Reconsidered\" (1962), \"The Face in Western Art\" (1963); and \"The Face of the Nude\" (1965). His 1964 work on W. Somerset Maugham was written for the British Council, and his later novels included \"City of Departures\" (1946), \"A Woman from Nowhere\" (1946), \"Sarah\" (1948), \"Julian's Way\" (1949), \"Turn the Key Softly\" (1951), \"The Prime of Life\" (1954), and \"The Day They Robbed the Bank of England\" (1959), made into a 1960 film of the same name starring Peter O'Toole and Aldo Ray.

Kemeny\n\nJohn George Kemeny; May 31, 1926 – December 26, 1992) was a Hungarian-Jewish born American mathematician, computer scientist, and educator best known for co-developing the BASIC programming language in 1964 with Thomas E. Kurtz. Kemeny served as the 13th President of Dartmouth College from 1970 to 1981 and pioneered the use of computers in college education. Kemeny chaired the presidential commission that investigated the Three Mile Island accident in 1979. According to György Marx he was one of The Martians.\n\nBorn in Budapest, Hungary, Kemeny attended the Rácz private primary school in Budapest and was a classmate of Nandor Balazs. In 1938 his father left for the United States alone. In 1940, he took the whole Kemeny family to the United States when the adoption of the second anti-Jewish law in Hungary became imminent. His grandfather, however, refused to leave and perished in the Holocaust, along with an aunt and uncle. Kemeny's family settled in New York City where he attended George Washington High School. He graduated with the best results in his class three years later. In 1943 Kemeny entered Princeton University where he studied mathematics and philosophy, but he took a year off during his studies to work on the Manhattan Project in Los Alamos National Laboratory. His boss there was Richard Feynman. He also worked there with John von Neumann. Returning to Princeton, Kemeny graduated with his BA in 1947, then worked for his Doctorate under Alonzo Church, also at Princeton. He worked as Albert Einstein's mathematical assistant during graduate school. At 23 years old, Kemeny was awarded his doctorate in 1949 for a dissertation entitled \"Type-Theory vs. Set-Theory.\"\n\nKemeny was appointed to the Dartmouth Mathematics Department as a full professor in 1953, at the age of 27. Two years later he became chairman of the Department, and held this post until 1967. \nKemeny ventured into curriculum development when he introduced Finite mathematics courses. He teamed with Gerald L. Thompson and J. Laurie Snell to write \"Introduction to Finite Mathematics\" (1957) for students of biology and social sciences. The Dartmouth mathematics department professors also wrote \"Finite Mathematical Structures\" (1959) and \"Finite Mathematics with Business Applications\" (1962). Other colleges and universities followed this lead and several more textbooks in \"Finite Mathematics\" were composed elsewhere. The topic of Markov chains was particularly popular so Kemeny teamed with J. Laurie Snell to publish \"Finite Markov Chains\" (1960) to provide an introductory college textbook. Considering the advances using potential theory obtained by G. A. Hunt, they wrote \"Denumerable Markov Chains\" in 1966. This textbook, suitable for advanced seminars, was followed by a second edition in 1976 when an additional chapter on random fields by David Griffeath was included.\n\nKemeny and Kurtz pioneered the use of computers for ordinary people. After early experiments with the LGP-30, they invented the BASIC programming language in 1964, as well as one of the world's first time-sharing systems, the Dartmouth Time-Sharing System (DTSS). In 1974, the American Federation of Information Processing Societies gave an award to Kemeny and Kurtz at the National Computer Conference for their work on BASIC and time-sharing.\n\nKemeny was president of Dartmouth from 1970 to 1981, and continued to teach undergraduate courses and to do research and publish papers during his time as president. He presided over the coeducation of Dartmouth in 1972. He also instituted the \"Dartmouth Plan\" of year-round operations, thereby allowing more students without more buildings. During his administration, Dartmouth became more proactive in recruiting and retaining minority students and revived its founding commitment to provide education for American Indians. Kemeny made Dartmouth a pioneer in student use of computers, equating computer literacy with reading literacy. In 1982 he returned to teaching full-time.\n\nIn 1983, Kemeny and Kurtz co-founded a company called True BASIC, Inc. to market True BASIC, an updated version of the language.\n\nJohn Kemeny died at the age of 66, the result of heart failure in Lebanon, New Hampshire on December 26, 1992. He had lived in Etna, near the Dartmouth Campus.\n\n\n"}

She is also known for coining the term \"neurodivergent\" to describe a person with atypical neurological functioning or processes, and \"neurodivergence\" to describe various types of atypical neurological functioning or processes, including developmental disabilities, learning disabilities, and mental illnesses.\n\nAsasumasu was diagnosed as autistic at three and a half years old.

He met Blue Devil on a film set, and became quite a fan of the hero, dreaming about one day becoming Blue’s sidekick.\n\nEdward snuck into Blue Devil's workshop at night and, using his prodigious knowledge of electronics, created a battlesuit incorporating the designs of the Blue Devil suit. Even though Blue Devil did not want a sidekick, Eddie was determined to make a go at being a hero. As \"Kid Devil\", he assisted his hero in foiling an airplane hijacking, and later helped defeat one of his enemies, the Vanquisher. After these adventures, his parents left Eddie's education and supervision to professors at the Institute of Hypernormal Conflict Studies.\n\nAfter Eddie's Aunt Marla died in a helicopter crash, Eddie attempted to live up to her name and succeed in the movie business. His attempts failed, however, and Eddie continued to have adventures as Kid Devil. He helps Young Justice's assault on Zandia, a small country that has become a refuge for supervillains.\n\nSince the events in \"Infinite Crisis\", Eddie has tried to join the Teen Titans with little success. Pulsar helps Eddie get into a project Lex Luthor has been using to give normal humans superpowers. However, Eddie fails because of \"psychological problems\". One evening, Eddie is visited by a cloaked figure, who gives him a candle. Eddie then goes to find his friend, Zachary Zatara. Zatara, being a magician, knows a little about magic and tells Eddie that the candle is a \" 'demon stick' \", forged in demon's blood. Zatara tells Eddie that if you light it, it will take you to its creator (which could be anyone). Eddie asks if, after teleporting them both to the creator, Zatara could just teleport them back. Zatara brags that he could, even though his magic could only affect things, not people. Not knowing of Zatara's inability to teleport anyone anywhere, Eddie decides to light it and the two are taken to Neron. Neron makes a deal with Eddie, transforming him into a \"new\" Kid Devil. Neron's magic gives Eddie a new, demonic appearance and inherent superpowers. As part of the deal, Eddie will not lose his soul to Neron if he can still trust Blue Devil by his 20th birthday. Before Eddie leaves, Neron tells him that it is Blue Devil's fault that his Aunt Marla died. Zachary helps Eddie join the Teen Titans, they battle Kid Crusader, and Zachary promises to keep his secret.\n\nOne Year Later, a rift has formed between Eddie and Zachary. Though Eddie is still friendly with Zachary, the boy magician wants nothing to do with Eddie or any of the other Titans. Eddie also forges a bond with Rose Wilson, as both new members feel like third-string Titans. For many months, Eddie tells the Titans of multiple daily phone calls to Blue Devil as his way of confirming that \"everything is fine\".\n\nOn a Titans mission, Eddie is disemboweled by Plasmus and the EMTs are unable to help him. The new Doom Patrol arrives and take Kid Devil to their HQ for treatment, where the Chief heals Eddie while also attempting to manipulate him into joining the Doom Patrol (as he has done to the other DP members). During the operation, the Chief revealed to Elasti-Girl that Kid Devil is not truly a demon by nature, but rather his powers are the result of metahuman gene manipulation. Robin calls Blue Devil, as he is on Kid Devil's emergency contact list, but finds that the number is out of order. Robin eventually tracks down Blue Devil and tells him the situation. Blue Devil tells Robin that he has not seen or spoken to Eddie in two years. When Robin confronts Eddie about his relationship with Blue Devil, Eddie confesses he was only pretending in order to better fit in with the Titans. The Chief's manipulation is stopped by both the Titans and the other members of the Doom Patrol, which makes Eddie feel as if he is finally accepted as a Titan since they stood up for him. He also tries rekindling his bond with Blue Devil, but the man does not show up to a meeting to which Eddie invited him. Later, Eddie finally finds and confronts Blue Devil. Blue Devil admits that he was to blame for his Aunt Marla's death and that it was an accident. As part of a deal with Neron for gaining fame and fortune, Blue Devil was asked to destroy an unmanned electrical power station. Despite Blue Devil's various precautions, a resulting power surge accidentally killed Marla, who was scouting the nearby area for a film. Eddie storms off before Blue Devil can explain further, telling Blue Devil to stay far away from him. Now having lost his trust in Blue Devil, Eddie knows that he will lose his soul to Neron. Still, Eddie decides to make the best of his remaining years by having a good time with his friends. He comforts himself by saying that, at least, he has Marla's memory and that Neron cannot take that away from him. However, it is revealed that Neron is holding Marla's soul captive.\n\nKid Devil is attacked by Kid Crusader, who vows to \"save\" him from Neron by turning Eddie back into a human and killing him. Kid Crusader appears to succeed when he exorcizes the demon from Eddie and returns him to his human form, but the demon is now bound to Kid Crusader himself. When given the choice later to either return to his demonic form or stay human, Eddie chooses his demonic form, not wishing to damn anyone else (even his enemy) to his fate as Neron's protégé.\n\nIn \"Teen Titans\" #51 (vol. 3), the \"Titans Tomorrow\" (a possible future version of the current Titans team) arrive in the present to aid the Teen Titans against Starro-controlled villains. Kid Devil is shown as part of the team, now known as Red Devil. He claims that even though the loss of his soul to Neron at 20 was bad, the power he receives far outweighs the consequences. \n\nEddie initially watches as Ravager battles alone against Rampage and Livewire, before betraying his older self in order to aid Rose. Later, Rose, Red Devil, and Eddie return to the Titan's Lair (home of the original Teen Titans), where they meet with Blue Beetle. There, Eddie learns that he is supposedly destined to murder the Blue Beetle some point in the future.\n\nShortly after Eddie, Rose, and Jaime find themselves surrounded by an army of Titans led by Lex Luthor before they all battle against an invading army of Starros. Thanks in large part to Blue Beetle's powers and Robin and Wonder Girl managing to supposedly alter Robin's future (and thus alter the future of the Titans as a whole), the army of Titans is defeated. However, prior to his vanishing, Red Devil warns Eddie against trusting Blue Beetle.\n\nIn \"Teen Titans\" (vol. 3) #56, a group of supervillains under the leadership of the new Clock King began a systematic assault on the Titans. With Wonder Girl, Blue Beetle, Ravager, and Robin away and Miss Martian still reeling from the battle with her future counterpart (whose mind is revealed to have taken refuge in Megan's), Eddie decides to throw a party in Titans Tower and invites several Titans fans. The party quickly gets out of hand when the guests trash the place, go through personal items, and prank call Batman. Lectured by all members of the team (except Miss Martian, who had left for the week to resolve her own problems), Eddie goes into town with one of the guests, who reveals himself to be Dreadbolt, the son of Bolt. A fight ensues and the arrival of the rest of the Terror Titans puts a quick end to the battle.\n\nIn the aftermath, Kid Devil finds himself chained to a wall and severely injured, captive of the Clock King, who then begins shattering his self-confidence telling him that Rose Wilson could not care less about his status, encouraging him to accept his place as a monster. Brought to the Dark Side Club as a challenger, he is imprisoned in the same cell in which Miss Martian is later brought, who finds him reduced to a rampaging, savage monster due to his physical and mental ordeal. M'Gann tries unsuccessfully to undo the damage, but Eddie is brought to face Hardrock in a death match.\nAfter the crisis with the Terror Titans is settled, Kid Devil is saved, and with the help of the Teen Titans, is able to rebuild his mental sanity while he is nursed back to health.\n\nStill trying to prove himself, he begins searching for Shockwave, who is rampaging apparently without a pattern throughout America, deliberately hiding from Robin his suspicions to avoid burdening the decimated Titans with an apparent wild goose chase.\n\nHe is forced then to accept the unwilling cooperation of Blue Beetle, who, demonstrating to be a better detective than he and a more seasoned fighter despite his later induction into heroics, goes on alone. In a fit of anger spurred by his inability to come in and fight Shockwave, he finally unlocks the full might of his demonic powers, as demonstrated by his future counterpart, teleporting effortlessly from Salt Lake City to Denver and melting off Shockwave's exoskeleton with a touch.\n\nKid Devil is able to resolve his jealousy issues about Ravager when he learns that Blue Beetle had no interest in her at all. He then honors his newfound maturity by taking the sobriquet of \"Red Devil\". Jaime happily teases Eddie about his new costume, hinting that while in the \"Tomorrow\" history they were sworn enemies; at present, they have a budding friendship signified by Eddie giving Jaime the playful nickname \"Bug-Butt\" which Jaime reciprocates by calling him \"Sizzle-Shorts\".\n\nAround this time the events of \"Final Crisis\" happen, Eddie becomes one of the last few super-powered resistance members operating out of the time-tossed Justice League Watchtower. The Miracle Machine restores everything back to normal.\n\nUnfortunately, soon after Blue Beetle joins the team, Miss Martian, with whom Eddie had become increasingly closer, has opted to leave the team due in large part to her being merged with her evil future self. Still, Eddie appears to have become more content with his life amongst the Titans and has become closer to Blue Beetle and his girlfriend Traci 13. During a Christmas trip to New York, Miss Martian appeared to him to wish him a Merry Christmas and promised that she would return soon.\n\nSoon after, the Titans began having a membership drive, with Red Devil teleporting to each potential hero so as to offer them membership. Unfortunately, none seem available or willing to join. The stress of multiple 'ports eventually causes Eddie to pass out on his return to the tower. On the night that follows, Robin opts to leave the team shortly before Brother Blood returns from Hell. During the battle against him, Blood manages to absorb the demonic power from Eddie, leaving him human again and supposedly free of Neron's debt.\n\nEddie, now powerless, is offered by Kid Eternity a chance to travel to Hell and see his contract with Neron in an attempt to regain his powers. Learning that he had not signed the contract, he finds that Neron tapped into his metagene, which activated his demon-like powers. Blaze, having won the war in Hell, offers Eddie a new contract, with his demonic powers now irrevocable, but with the same price of servitude as Neron's contract. Kid Eternity intervenes and summons Eddie's Aunt Marla. Marla convinces Eddie not to take the contract. Eddie continues to be a member of the team, but his ability to help is unclear. To add insult to injury, Eddie is asked by new Titan recruit Static if he is the \"team janitor\" due to his lack of abilities. During the prelude to the Deathtrap crossover, Eddie dons his old mechanical costume to combat the Tower's defense mechanisms, which had been overridden by crazed former Titan Jericho.\n\nHis way of helping, which Bombshell repeatedly makes fun of, is to be the eyes and ears for the Teen Titans when the new Fearsome Five reform under the Calculator. However, he is also seen as helping the team through communications and coordinating missions at Titans Tower. \n\nHe later died saving the city from a radioactive man who was about to explode while the other Titans were putting down a prison riot. It appears that this was all part of the Calculator's plan to get revenge at the Titans for the previous death of his son Marvin and the injury of his daughter Wendy.\n\nIn September 2011, The New 52 rebooted DC's continuity. In this new timeline, Eddie Bloomberg first appears as the godson to Blue Devil.\n\nOriginally, Eddie wore a devil suit which gave him enhanced strength and agility, near impenetrable armor, a weapons system that included a bright light burst effect, exploding bubbles, night vision, and mini-gills. He also had a rocket trident which could propel him through the air for distances of up to several miles and could emit flames and/or electric shocks.\n\nAfter the events of \"Infinite Crisis\" and \"52\", Eddie has a demonic appearance and inherent abilities, both granted to him by the demon-lord Neron. His new form gives him a capacity to breathe fire, enhanced strength and endurance, and an ability to heal from non-fatal wounds ten times faster than a human. When punched in the stomach, Eddie cannot control his fire breath. Eddie's blood is now a thick gasoline-smelling liquid, his breath is hotter than fire, his own skin is able to cause burns (being at 200 degrees) and he has been seen to be able to increase this, to the point of his skin turning white hot. He can fire streams of flame from his hands, has retractable wings underneath his arms that help him glide, possesses a prehensile tail, and his internal temperature is 600°. He learned how to create portals of fire through which he can travel long distances.\n\nWhen Dr. Niles Caulder, leader of the Doom Patrol, tended Kid Devil's injury, he revealed that the young hero is not a demon nor are his powers supernatural in nature, despite being granted by a demon. Rather, Neron activated Eddie's metahuman gene which gave him his powers. However, like a real demon, his skin still burns while inside a church due to his deal with Neron.\n\nEddie lost his powers due to an attack by the new Brother Blood, Sebastion, shortly before sacrificing himself to save the other Titans.\n\nIn the alternate universe of \"Flashpoint\", Kid Devil is a member of the Resistance.\n\nA spacebound Blue Devil met a futuristic version of Edward who was saved from being erased from existence. Blue Devil also encountered a Nazi version of him.\n\nKid Devil appears in \"Tiny Titans\" as a toddler. Raven often has to babysit for him. Her father, Trigon, shows more of an interest in Kid Devil than in Raven when she does. He thinks of Kid Devil as \"a cute little baby\". Raven often tells Trigon that Kid Devil is not a baby, he is a little kid. However, Trigon does not listen and only babies Kid Devil more. Kid Devil does not speak in this series and relies solely on visual gags. In one issue, Kid Devil travels to the center of the Earth with Terra, Hotspot, and Beast Boy, and meets Etrigan.\n"}

Born in Denver, Colorado, she attended Laguna Beach High School as a teenager after spending junior high and freshman year living in Barrington, Illinois. In 2004, Cavallari came to prominence after being cast in the reality television series \"\", which documented the lives of her and her friends.\n\nAfter moving to Los Angeles to pursue an acting career in 2006, Cavallari appeared in several television series as minor characters.\n\nCavallari is married to American football player Jay Cutler.\n\nCavallari was born in Denver, Colorado, one of two children of Judith Eifrig and Dennis Cavallari. She is of German and Italian descent.\n\nCavallari was in her junior year of high school when the first season of \"\" began production. At the time, she was involved in an on-and-off relationship with senior Stephen Colletti. Cavallari's romance with Colletti caused a rivalry with another cast member, Lauren Conrad. The love triangle became one of the series' central plot lines.\n\nIn May 2009, Cavallari confirmed she would be joining the cast of \"Laguna Beach\"'s spin-off series, \"The Hills\". She made her first appearance on the series during the fifth season's midseason finale on May 31, 2009, at Heidi Montag and Spencer Pratt's wedding, where she caught the bouquet. The second half of the season premiered on September 29, 2009, with Cavallari assuming the position of former main cast member and narrator Conrad. Despite originally signing a deal with MTV to appear in two additional seasons following the fifth, the sixth and final season concluded on July 13, 2010.\n\nCavallari was on the 13th season of ABC's \"Dancing with the Stars\" and partnered with two-time champion, Mark Ballas. She was the third to be eliminated.\n\nAfter \"Laguna Beach\", Cavallari headed to Los Angeles and signed on the UPN reality television series \"Get This Party Started\", which premiered February 7, 2006. The series was canceled after airing two episodes. She appeared on one episode of another UPN series, \"Veronica Mars\", and went on to guest roles on series including \"\", \"Cane\", and \"Adventures in Hollyhood\". In 2006, she signed on as Crystal in the horror film \"Fingerprints\".\n\nIn 2008, she had a supporting role as Summer in \"Spring Breakdown\" alongside Amy Poehler. The film was released straight-to-DVD on June 2, 2009, and received mixed reviews. She also starred in the independent film \"Green Flash\" with Torrey DeVitto. In 2009, she starred in the independent American high school comedy film, \"Wild Cherry\", as Trish, which also starred Rumer Willis. She also starred in the straight-to-DVD film, \"\", as Kaitlyn. The film was released July 14, 2009, to mixed to negative reviews.\n\nIn March 2012, Kristin commented her first Oscars with the E! team and in 2014, began 'hosting the half-hour fashion/lifestyle trends show called \"The Fabulist\" alongside Orly Shani (Fashion Star).' Kristin is also passionate about food and decided to write a cookbook called \"True Roots - A Mindful Kitchen with more than 100 recipes Free of Gluten, Dairy and Refined Sugar\". The book made it on the \"New Yorker's\" best-selling list at number three. \n\nOn April 4, 2018, E! announced that Cavallari would be getting her own reality show, \"Very Cavallari\". It premiered in summer 2018 and followed \"Kristin as she opens the flagship store and Nashville headquarters of her rapidly growing fashion and lifestyle brand Uncommon James\". The show was renewed for a second season on August 23, 2018. \n\nCavallari has been involved in the \"Until There's a Cure\" public service advertising campaign, to raise awareness and funds for AIDS and HIV research and vaccine development. In 2006, Cavallari appeared in ads for PETA, and has also appeared as a celebrity spokesperson for \"We Are Ellis Island\", a campaign for the restoration of Ellis Island. In February 2009, she posed for the NOH8 Campaign in support of gay marriage.\n\nIn January 2010, she traveled to El Salvador to do charity work. In March 2011, Cavallari traveled to Kenya to do charity work with the nonprofit One Kid One World.\n\nIn March 2014, Cavallari drew national criticism for refusing to vaccinate her children, a decision her husband, Jay Cutler, and she based on fears of a connection between childhood vaccination and autism.\n\nFrom 2015–2016, the former website Gawker ran a series of daily articles on Cavallari for a streak of 415 days. The series, by Allie Jones, was called \"500 Days of Kristin\", although it ended after just 415 days, with the publication of Cavallari's book \"Balancing in Heels\". By treating Cavallari's quotidian Instagram posts as newsworthy, the series appeared to gently mock the culture of celebrity women on social media.\n\nCavallari began dating then-Chicago Bears quarterback Jay Cutler in late 2010, and they became engaged in April 2011. They called off the engagement in July 2011, but reconciled in November 2011. Cavallari and Cutler wed on June 8, 2013, in Nashville, Tennessee. They have three children: sons Camden Jack (born August 8, 2012), Jaxon Wyatt (born May 7, 2014) and daughter Saylor James (born November 23, 2015).\n\nIn June 2018, Cavallari and Cutler put their mansion in Nashville up for sale for $7.9 million. The mansion is seen in numerous scenes of \"Very Cavallari\". The couple purchased a cheaper mansion in Nashville for $4.2 million in April 2018.\n\nHer brother, Michael Cavallari, was found dead on December 10, 2015, having died of hypothermia following a car crash.\n"}

{"id": "4464191", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=4464191", "title": "Muhammad Ma Jian", "text": "Muhammad Ma Jian\n\nMuhammad Ma Jian (Gejiu, 1906 – Beijing, 1978) ( \"\"; English translation: Muhammad Ma Jian the Chinese) was a Chinese Islamic scholar and translator of Muslim Hui ethnicity. He is notable for translating the Qur'an into Chinese and stressing compatibility between Marxism and Islam.\n\nJian was born in 1906 in Shadian, a village in the Gejiu county of Yunnan. This was a majority-Hui village that would later be the site of the infamous Shadian incident during China's Cultural Revolution. When Jian was six years old, he was sent to the provincial capital of Kunming, where he would receive his primary and secondary education until the age of 19. Following his graduation, Jian returned to his hometown of Shadian to teach at a Sino-Arabic primary school for two years - an experience which he did not enjoy. This was followed by a stint of study under Hu Songshan in Guyuan, a city in the Hui region of Ningxia. He then went to Shanghai for further education in 1929, where he studied at the Shanghai Islamic Normal School for 2 years.\n\nFollowing the Japanese invasion of Manchuria in 1931, Jian was sent by the Chinese government to Al-Azhar University in Cairo, Egypt, to cultivate relations with Arab nations. He was a member of the first group of government-sponsored Chinese students to study there - which included men who would later become leading Chinese scholars of Arabic and Islam, such as Na Zhong. While in Cairo, he contacted the Muslim Brotherhood-affiliated Salafi Publishing House, which agreed in 1934 to publish one of his works - the first full-length book in Arabic on the history of Islam in China. A year later, Jian translated the \"Analects\" into Arabic. Whilst in Cairo, he would also subsequently translate several of Muhammad Abduh's works into Chinese, with the assistance of Rashid Rida, as well as 's \"The Truth of Islam\". To promote Chinese interests in the context of the Second Sino-Japanese War, Jian was sent to Mecca in early 1939 as part of a hajj delegation alongside 27 other students - a journey on which they spoke to Ibn Saud about the determination of 'all the Chinese people' to resist the Japanese.\n\nJian returned to China in 1939. There he edited the \"Arabic-Chinese Dictionary\", while translating the \"Qur'an\" and works of Islamic philosophy and history. He also became a professor of Arabic and Islamic studies at Peking University in 1946, a role in which he oversaw the introduction of the first Arabic-language courses in the Chinese higher education system. At Peking University, he would train many of the next generation's most prominent Chinese Arabists, such as . His initial translation of the Qur'an's first 8 volumes was completed in 1945, and after being rejected by Beijing publishing houses in 1948, this was published by Peking University Press a year later. Following the Communist victory in the Chinese Civil War and the proclamation of the People's Republic of China, he was also elected as a member of the People's Political Consultative Conference in 1949. In 1952, another edition of his Qur'an translation was published by Shanghai's Commercial Press, and Jian became one of the founders of the Islamic Association of China. As part of this role, Jian also aimed to increase public awareness of Islam - which he did by publishing several articles in newspapers such as the People's Daily and the Guangming Daily. He also published a translation of 's \"History of Philosophy in Islam\" in 1958. Due to his linguistic skills, he served as a high-level interpreter for Chinese officials such as Zhou Enlai, whom he enabled to speak to Gamal Abdel Nasser at the Bandung Conference. It was this that allowed him to keep his professorship and post in the PPCC until his death in 1978, despite widespread persecution of Muslims during the upheaval of the Cultural Revolution. Following his death, Jian's translation of Philip K. Hitti's History of the Arabs was published in 1979 by the Commercial Press. The China Social Sciences Press also posthumously printed, in 1981, his complete translation of the Qur'an, which Jian had worked on up until 1957, and then between 1976 and 1978.\n\nMa Jian has been praised for his 'two-way' contribution to Sino-Arab cross-cultural exchange - that is, his translations of Confucian literature into Arabic, and Quran into Chinese.\n\nHis translation of the Qur'an remains the most popular in China today, surpassing versions by Wang Jingzhai and Li Tiezheng. It has been lauded for its faithfulness to the original, and has reached an 'almost canonical status'. The quality of this translation has also been recognised internationally - with the Medina-based King Fahd Holy Qur'an Printing Press opting to use it for their Arabic-Chinese bilingual edition of the Quran, published in 1987.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "113479", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=113479", "title": "Norma McCorvey", "text": "Norma McCorvey\n\nNorma Leah McCorvey Nelson; (September 22, 1947 – February 18, 2017), better known by the legal pseudonym \"Jane Roe\", was the plaintiff in the landmark American lawsuit \"Roe v. Wade\" in 1973. The U.S. Supreme Court ruled that individual state laws banning abortion are unconstitutional. Later, McCorvey's views on abortion changed substantially; she became a Roman Catholic activist in the pro-life movement.\n\nMcCorvey was born in Simmesport, Louisiana. She was briefly raised at her family's residence in Lettsworth in Pointe Coupee Parish. Later in her childhood, the family moved to Houston, Texas. McCorvey's father left the family when she was 13 years old and her parents subsequently divorced. She and her older brother were raised by their mother Mildred, a violent alcoholic. McCorvey's father died on September 27, 1995. She was of partial Cajun ancestry.\n\nMcCorvey had entered a Catholic boarding school prior to her minor troubles with law enforcement that started at the age of ten, when she robbed the cash register at a gas station and ran away to Oklahoma City with a friend. They tricked a hotel worker into letting them rent a room, and were there for two days when a maid walked in on her and her female friend kissing. McCorvey was arrested and brought to court, where she was declared a ward of the state and sent to state-run institutions.\n\nLater, McCorvey was sent to the State School for Girls in Gainesville, Texas, on and off from ages 11 to 15. She said this was the happiest time of her childhood, and every time she was sent home, would purposely do something bad to be sent back. After being released, McCorvey lived with her mother’s cousin, who allegedly raped her every night for three weeks. When McCorvey's mother found out, her cousin claimed McCorvey was lying.\n\nWhile working at a restaurant, Norma met Woody McCorvey (born 1940), and she married him at the age of 16. She later left him after he allegedly assaulted her. She moved in with her mother and gave birth to her first child, Melissa, in 1965. After Melissa's birth, McCorvey developed a severe drinking problem. Soon after, she began identifying as a lesbian. She went on a weekend trip to visit two friends and left her baby with her mother. When she returned, her mother replaced Melissa with a baby doll and reported her to the police as having abandoned her baby, and called the police to take her out of the house. She would not tell her where Melissa was for weeks and finally let her visit her child after three months. She allowed McCorvey to move back in, and one day woke Norma up after a long day of work. She told Norma to sign insurance papers, and Norma did so without reading. However, she signed adoption papers, giving her mother custody of Melissa, and was then kicked out of the house. The following year, McCorvey again became pregnant and gave birth to a baby, who was placed for adoption.\n\nIn 1969, at the age of 21, McCorvey became pregnant a third time and returned to Dallas. According to McCorvey, friends advised her that she should assert falsely that she had been raped and that she could thereby obtain a legal abortion under Texas's law which prohibited abortion; sources differ over whether the Texas law had such a rape exception. Due to lack of police evidence or documentation, the scheme was not successful and McCorvey would later admit the situation was a fabrication. She attempted to obtain an illegal abortion, but the respective clinics had been closed down by authorities.\n\nEventually, McCorvey was referred to attorneys Linda Coffee and Sarah Weddington, who were looking for pregnant women who were seeking abortions. The case took three years of trials to reach the Supreme Court of the United States, and Norma never attended a single trial. In the meantime, she had given birth to the baby in question, who was eventually adopted.\n\nMcCorvey revealed herself to the press as being \"Jane Roe\" soon after the decision's issuance and stated that she sought an abortion because she was unemployable and greatly depressed. In the 1980s, McCorvey asserted that she had been the \"pawn\" of two young and ambitious lawyers (Weddington and Coffee) who were looking for a plaintiff with whom they could challenge the Texas state law prohibiting abortion.\n\nIn her first book, the 1994 autobiography, \"I Am Roe\", McCorvey wrote of her sexual orientation. For many years, she had lived quietly in Dallas with her long-time partner, Connie Gonzales. \"We're not like other lesbians, going to bars,\" she explained in a \"New York Times\" interview. \"We're lesbians together. We're homers.\" That same year, she became a Christian and voiced remorse for her part in the Supreme Court decision. McCorvey worked as part of the pro-life movement, such as Operation Rescue.\n\nAt a signing of \"I Am Roe\", McCorvey was befriended by evangelical minister and National Director of Operation Rescue Flip Benham and later baptized on August 8, 1995, by Benham, in a Dallas, Texas, backyard swimming pool, an event that was filmed for national television. Two days later she announced that she had quit her job at the abortion clinic she was working at, and had become an advocate of Operation Rescue's campaign to make abortion illegal.\n\nMcCorvey's second book, \"Won by Love\", was published in 1998. She explained her change on the stance of abortion with the following comments:\n\nShortly thereafter, McCorvey released a statement that affirmed her reception into the Latin Rite of the Catholic Church, and she was Confirmed as a full member.\n\nLater in life, McCorvey stated that she was no longer a lesbian. On August 17, 1998, she was received into the Roman Catholic church by Father Frank Pavone, the International Director of Priests for Life and Father Edward Robinson in Dallas.\n\nIn February 2005, McCorvey petitioned the Supreme Court to overturn the 1973 decision with \"McCorvey v. Hill\", arguing that she had standing to do so as one of the original litigants and that the case should be heard once again in light of what she claimed was evidence that the procedure harms women, but the petition was denied, because the Supreme Court considered the matter to be moot.\n\nOn January 22, 2008, McCorvey endorsed Republican presidential candidate Ron Paul. McCorvey stated, \"I support Ron Paul for president because we share the same goal, that of overturning \"Roe v. Wade\". He has never wavered on the issue of being pro-life and has a voting record to prove it. He understands the importance of civil liberties for all, including the unborn.\"\n\nMcCorvey remained active in pro-life demonstrations, including one she participated in before President Barack Obama's commencement address to the graduates of the University of Notre Dame (the decision to invite the President to speak at the university on May 17, 2009 was controversial because his views on abortion conflicted with the teachings of the Catholic Church, with which the University is affiliated). McCorvey was arrested on the first day of U.S. Senate hearings for the confirmation of the presidential nomination to the Supreme Court of the United States of Sonia Sotomayor, after McCorvey and another protester began shouting during Senator Al Franken's opening statement.\n\n\"Lake of Fire\", a 2006 pro-choice documentary by Tony Kaye on the abortion controversy in the United States, features McCorvey discussing her involvement in \"Roe v. Wade\" and her subsequent conversion to Catholicism.\n\nMcCorvey made her acting debut in \"Doonby\", shot on location in 2010 in the small central Texas town of Smithville. Starring John Schneider, Jenn Gotzon and Robert Davi, the film previewed at the 2011 Cannes Film Festival and was released in late 2011.\n\nMcCorvey died of heart failure in Katy, Texas, on February 18, 2017, at the age of 69.\n\n\n"}

The coins were struck by one of his descendants in commemoration of the exploit. The one pictured here has on the obverse the head of Numonius, with the inscription \"C.

Vaala is an ancient form of Vala, just as on the coins of Sulla we find \"Feelix\" instead of \"Felix\".\n\nNumonius Vala, to whom Horace addresses one of his Epistles (i. 15), appears to have had estates in the neighbourhood of Velia and Salernum, since the poet makes inquiries of Vala about the climate of those places, as he intended to pass the winter in one of them. As this poem was probably written about 22 BC, the friend of Horace was most likely the father of the Numonius Vala below, if not the same person.\n\nNumonius Vala was a legate of Publius Quinctilius Varus in 9 AD. He left the infantry when they were attacked by the enemy in the fatal Battle of the Teutoburg Forest and fled with the cavalry to the Rhine, but was overtaken in his flight and slain.\n"}

Goldmark retired in 2010 as director of the Environmental Defense Fund's climate and air program. He was previously the chairman and CEO of the \"International Herald Tribune\", the president of the Rockefeller Foundation, the executive director of the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, and the budget director for the State of New York. He is noted for being an advocate for social causes and environmental issues in many of his assignments. He was responsible for management of multi-billion-dollar budgets in some of his posts.\n\nGoldmark is the son of Peter Carl Goldmark, who led the development of LP records and invented the first practical color television, among other innovations, and the former Frances Trainer. He graduated from Harvard University in 1962. Thereafter he taught at the Putney School in Vermont for two years, where he met his wife, née Aliette Marie Misson. Goldmark has reportedly maintained a residence in Brooklyn, New York since his tenure with the Rockefeller Foundation.\n\nGoldmark's career started with state government in Massachusetts and New York, progressed to leadership in multiple philanthropic organizations as president of the Rockefeller Foundation, continued to journalism and publishing with \"Newsday\" and the \"International Herald Tribune\" and included a leadership role in the Environmental Defense Fund.\n\nGoldmark was selected for responsible positions in government at a young age, starting with heading the Massachusetts Department of Human Services at age 30. He next was the budget director of the State of New York under Governor Hugh L. Carey from 1975 to 1977 where he was credited with being the architect of the rescue of both the state and New York City from a budget crisis.\nNext, he headed the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey as executive director for eight years, where he was credited with \"having transformed a sluggish bistate agency into an energetic vehicle for regional economic improvement.\" He also worked for several other New York politicians, including New York City mayor, John Lindsay, in 1970 as chief of staff and governor, Eliot Spitzer, as co-chair of his transition team.\n\nIn 1988, the Rockefeller Foundation chose Goldmark to become its eleventh president and direct the deployment of the foundation's reported $1.7 billions in assets at the time. During his tenure, he reportedly grew the foundation's assets by $1 billion and directed programs towards school reforms, the education of women and poor Americans. He left the organization in 1997. Goldmark served on the boards of directors of several other philanthropic or civic organizations, including the Whitehead Institute for Biomedical Research and the National Commission on Civic Renewal.\n\nIn 1985, he became senior vice president of the Times Mirror Company's Newsday for two years.

He was a strong advocate for sustainable development, noting the interplay of global climate change, financing, technologies and the institutions, including foundations, that can address these factors. Upon retiring from the EDF in 2010, he expressed disappointment that his generation had failed to solve the world's environmental issues. He was especially concerned about the lack of action within the U.S. government and held hope that other governments of populous countries might realize the need for action before effects like global warming become irreversible.\n\nOn four occasions from 1981 to 1994, Goldmark was designated one of the \"Young Leaders\" selected by the French-American Foundation, which matches French and American \"up-and-coming leaders\" in various walks of life and brings them together for five days of discussions on topics of common interest.\n\nGoldmark received the Wilson Wyatt National Award for Urban Revitalization and became a member of the French Legion of Honor.

In 1993, he held the rank of major in the Rwandan Armed Forces and was second-in-command of military operations and intelligence (S2 and S3) in the Presidential Guard Battalion. Later the same year, he was appointed Commander of the Presidential Guard Battalion.\n\nThe ICTR indictment alleges that between 1990 and 1994, Mpiranya and other officers conspired to exterminate the Tutsi civilians and political opponents, and helped to train \"interahamwe\" and militia groups who committed the genocide.\n\nOn 5 January 1994, the day that the Broad-Based Transitional Government specified by the Arusha Accords was to be sworn in, Mpiranya prevented the access of political opponents onto the premises of the \"Conseil national de développement\", particularly Lando Ndasingwa and his Liberal Party. This had the result that the only member of the Transitional Government who had been sworn in was President Habyarimana.\n\nAfter Habyarimana's death and the start of the genocide, members of the Presidential Guard presumedly led by Mpiranya \"tracked down, arrested and killed\" Rwandan Prime Minister Agathe Uwilingiyimana. They also took into custody 10 Belgian peacekeepers from UNAMIR who had been guarding her house, who were later gruesomely killed. They were accompanied in this by members of the Para-Commando Battalion and the A company of the Reconnaissance Battalion, led by Captain Innocent Sagahutu.\n\nSimultaneously, other members of the presidential guard and other army units undertook similar actions against other opposition figures.\n\nOn the morning of 7 April, Mpiranya was told by members of the Presidential Guard that Faustin Rucogoza, the Minister of Information, and his wife were presently being detained at the Presidential Guard camp. He allegedly responded by asking his soldiers why they were keeping them. Shortly afterwards, both were killed in the camp.\n\nMpiranya fled Rwanda after the RPF victory.\n\nIn an indictment amended on 25 September 2002, the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda (ICTR) charged Mpiranya with \"conspiracy to commit genocide, genocide, crimes against humanity, and violations of the Geneva Convention.\"\n\nFor several years Mpiranya was still at large and believed to be with other Rwandan émigrés in the Democratic Republic of the Congo or in Zimbabwe.\n\nOn 25 September 2002, Mpiranya was indicted by the U.N.'s International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda (ICTR). He was charged with genocide, conspiracy to commit genocide, complicity in genocide, crimes against humanity and war crimes. Mpiranya remained at large and was one of the most wanted men by the Tribunal.\n\nIn February 2010, Mpiranya was reported by Belgian authorities to be sheltered by the Zimbabwean government, operating businesses in Harare, on top of acting as mercenary for the ruling party ZANU-PF to silence the opposition.\n\nIn August 2010, Rwanda appealed for United Nations intervention in its diplomatic row after the Zimbabwean government refused to extradite Protais Mpiranya to the ICTR. Mpiranya allegedly stayed in Norton, about 40 km west of the capital Harare, where he allegedly stayed since his arrival in Zimbabwe in 2001. Security sources said that the Harare authorities were not keen on giving up the fugitive to whom they feel indebted over his reconnaissance role during the 1998–2001 Democratic Republic of Congo civil war. Mpiranya was instrumental during the DRC war after he worked side by side with southern African Allied forces, which included Zimbabwe, Angola and Namibia. He is believed to have supplied strategic information about the Rwandan military and also mobilised and trained Rwandans in refugee camps in eastern DRC to fight against the Rwandan army. Rwanda's Prosecutor General Martin Ngoga said the International Criminal Tribunal of Rwanda (ICTR) should move and bring Proitas Mpiranya to book. The two nations backed opposite sides in the DRC war. The row escalated after Zimbabwe accused Rwandan secret agents of illegally entering the country in pursuit of Mpiranya. Kigali denied the allegations, saying it would follow proper procedures to seek the extradition of Mpiranya. This was the second time that Zimbabwe has refused to extradite African officials accused of genocide in their own countries. It has refused to hand over former Ethiopian dictator Mengistu Haile Mariam who is wanted in his country for mass murder.\n\nDespite a Zimbabwean official denying he was in the country in 2011, Zimbabwe's police announced in September 2012 that they have commenced a manhunt for Mpiranya. The UN's war crimes tribunal on Rwanda offered a USD5 million for his capture.\n\n"}

He was christened on 21 January 1854 at the Purísima Concepción Roman Catholic Church in Mexico. His recorded paternal baptismal surname was \"Corrales\", however the surname \"Corral\" is commonly used. \n\nRamón Corral first gained public attention in 1872, when General Don Ignacio L. Pesqueira, Governor of the State of Sonora, an undefeated general who had provided many services to his state, created public outrage when he introduced state constitutional reforms. To avoid compliance with a law, Pesqueira introduced, among other reforms, a ban on re-election governor. The young Corral vigorously fought against the Pesqueira administration through the press, founding the newspapers \"El Fantasma\" (\"The Phantom\"), and \"La Voz de Álamos\" (\"The Voice of Álamos\"). His writings in the papers exhibited civil valor, love for democracy, and power as a political adversary of the Pesqueira administration. In the years that followed, Corral increasingly became involved in politics.\n\nWhile General Secretary of the Government of Sonora, Corral was involved with the capture of the indigenous Yaqui military leader José Maria Leiva, known as Cajemé. In \"La Constitución\" (Periódico oficial del gobierno del estado libre y soberano de Sonora), beginning with the issue of April 22, 1887, and ending July 8, 1887, Corral published biographical notes about Cajemé, which were recorded only a few days earlier during personal talks with the captured Yaqui. Cajemé was being held at the time in the house of the military chief of the area, Angel Martínez, who had personally arrested him while Cajemé was hiding in San Jose de Guaymas.\n\nCorral married Amparo V. Escalante on February 25, 1888. She was the daughter of Vicente Escalante, a well-known Mexican statesman of the time. The religious element of the twofold marriage ceremony was performed by Father Ortega of Hermosillo, with a civil ceremony performed by Civil Judge Bonito Méndez, of the Hermosillo District.\n\nCorral was one of the \"científicos\" who advised Mexican President Porfirio Díaz. Corral served as Secretary of State from 1891 to 1895. He became Governor of the Federal District of Mexico in 1900 and was sworn in as Minister of the Interior in the cabinet of Díaz in 1903. He became vice-president in 1904 and was re-elected in 1910.\n\n\nCorral traveled with his family to [Paris]] for medical care, where he was diagnosed with cancer. After his operation, the cancer was found to be incurable. In light of his own deteriorating health and the increasing revolutionary opposition to the Díaz government, Corral submitted his resignation, dated May 10, 1911, to Francisco León de la Barra, Díaz’s foreign secretary, which de la Barra held until Díaz submitted his own \"Renuncia\" on May 25, 1911.\n\nCorral's letter of resignation gave no doubt that he had foreknowledge of Díaz's intention to resign, and that the course of events would lead to a new government for Mexico:\n\n\"On the two occasions that the national convention advanced my candidacy as Vice-President of the republic, to figure in the elections with Gen. Diaz as President, I stated that I was prepared to occupy any office in which compatriots considered that I would be of use, and that if the public vote conferred upon me a position so far above my merits, then my intention would be to second in all respects Gen. Diaz's policy, in order to co-operate with him, as far as it lay in my power, toward the aggrandizement of the nation, which had developed so notably under his administration.\"\n\n\"Those who concern themselves with public affairs and have observed their progress during the last few years will be able to say whether I have complied with my intention.\"\n\n\"For my part, I can say that I have never endeavored to bring about the least obstacle either in the President's policy or his manner of carrying it out even at the cost of sacrificing my convictions, both because this was the basis of my programme and because this corresponded to my position and my loyalty, as well as that I did not seek any prestige in the office of Vice-President, so useful in the United States and so discredited in Latin countries.\"\n\n\"In the events which have shaken the country during these latter months, the President has been brought to consider that it is patriotic to resign from the high office that the almost unanimous vote of Mexicans had conferred upon him in the last election, and that it is advisable at the same time, in the interest of the country, that the Vice-President do likewise, so that new men and new energies should continue forwarding the prosperity of the nation.\"\n\n\"Following my program of seconding Gen. Diaz's policy, I join my resignation with his and in the present note I retire from the office of Vice-President of the republic, begging the chamber to accept the same at the same time as that of the President.\"\n\n\"I beg of you gentlemen to inform yourselves of the above, which I submit with the protests of my highest consideration.\"\n\n\"Liberty and Constitution, Paris, May 4, 1911.\"\n\n[Signed] \"RAMON CORRAL.\"\n\nCorral died of cancer in Paris on 10 November 1912, surrounded by family members.\n\n"}

One day as our saint was discoursing with a holy priest named Hermolaus, the latter, after praising the study of medicine, concluded thus: \"But, my friend, of what use are all thy acquirements in this art, since thou art ignorant of the science of salvation?\nBy miraculously healing a blind man by invoking the name of Jesus over him, Pantaleon converted his father, upon whose death he came into possession of a large fortune. He freed his slaves and, distributing his wealth among the poor, developed a great reputation in Nicomedia. Envious colleagues denounced him to the emperor during the Diocletian persecution. The emperor wished to save him and sought to persuade him to apostasy. Pantaleon, however, openly confessed his faith, and as proof that Christ was the true God, he healed a paralytic. Notwithstanding this, he was condemned to death by the emperor, who regarded the miracle as an exhibition of magic.\n\nAccording to the legend, Pantaleon's flesh was first burned with torches, whereupon Christ appeared to all in the form of Hermolaus to strengthen and heal Pantaleon. The torches were extinguished. Then a bath of molten lead was prepared; when the apparition of Christ stepped into the cauldron with him, the fire went out and the lead became cold. Pantaleon was now thrown into the sea, loaded with a great stone, which floated. He was thrown to wild beasts, but these fawned upon him and could not be forced away until he had blessed them. He was bound on the wheel, but the ropes snapped, and the wheel broke. An attempt was made to behead him, but the sword bent, and the executioners were converted to Christianity.\n\nPantaleon implored Heaven to forgive them, for which reason he also received the name of \"Panteleimon\" (\"mercy for everyone\" or \"all-compassionate\"). It was not until he himself desired it that it was possible to behead him, upon which there issued forth blood and a white liquid like milk.\n\nSt. Alphonsus wrote:\n\nAt Ravello, a city in the kingdom of Naples, there is a vial of his blood, which becomes blood every year [on his feastday], and may be seen in this state interspersed with the milk, as I, the author of this work, have seen it.\n\nThe \"vitae\" containing these miraculous features are all late in date and \"valueless\" according to the \"Catholic Encyclopedia\". Yet the fact of his martyrdom itself seems to be supported by a veneration for which there is testimony in the 5th century, among others in a sermon on the martyrs by Theodoret (died c. 457); Procopius of Caesarea (died c. 565?), writing on the churches and shrines constructed by Justinian I tells that the emperor rebuilt the shrine to Pantaleon at Nicomedia; and there is mention of Pantaleon in the \"Martyrologium Hieronymianum\".\n\nThe Eastern tradition concerning Pantaleon follows more or less the medieval Western hagiography, but lacks any mention of a visible apparition of Christ. It states instead that Hermolaus was still alive while Pantaleon's torture was under way, but was martyred himself only shortly before Pantaleon's beheading along with two companions, Hermippas and Thermocrates. The saint is canonically depicted as a beardless young man with a full head of curly hair.\n\nPantaleon's relics, venerated at Nicomedia, were transferred to Constantinople. Numerous churches, shrines, and monasteries have been named for him; in the West most often as St. Pantaleon and in the East as St. Panteleimon; to him is consecrated the St. Panteleimon Monastery at Mount Athos, St Panteleimon monastery in Myrtou, Cyprus, and the 12th-century Church of St. Panteleimon in Gorno Nerezi, Republic of Macedonia.\n\nArmenians believe that the Gandzasar Monastery in Nagorno Karabakh contains relics of St. Pantaleon, who was venerated in eastern provinces of Armenia.\n\nAt the Basilica of the Vierzehnheiligen near Staffelstein in Franconia, St. Pantaleon is venerated with his hands nailed to his head, reflecting another legend about his death.\n\nAfter the Black Death of the mid-14th century in Western Europe, as a patron saint of physicians and midwives, he came to be regarded as one of the fourteen guardian martyrs, the Fourteen Holy Helpers. Relics of the saint are found at Saint Denis at Paris; his head is venerated at Lyon. A Romanesque church was dedicated to him in Cologne in the 9th century at the latest.\n\nIn the British Library there is a surviving manuscript, written in Saxon Old English, of \"The Life of St Pantaleon\" (British Library, MS Cotton Vitellius D XVII), dating from the early eleventh century, possibly written for Abbot Ælfric of Eynsham. The Canons' Vestry off the south transept of Chichester Cathedral was formerly a square-plan chapel dedicated to Saint Pantaleon - it was possibly under construction just before the cathedral's great fire of 1187.\n\nIn France, he was depicted in a window in Chartres Cathedral. In southern France there are six communes under the protective name of Saint-Pantaléon. Though there are individual churches consecrated to him elsewhere, there are no communes named for him in the north or northwest of France. The six are:\n\n\nIn Cologne a 10th Century Romanesque church, partly built by the daughter of the Byzantine emperor, Theophanu, who married the Holy Roman Emperor Otto II in 972\n\nIn Italy, Pantaleon gives favourable lottery numbers, victories and winners in dreams. A phial containing some of his blood was long preserved at Ravello. On the feast day of the saint, the blood was said to become fluid and to bubble (compare Saint Januarius). Paolo Veronese's painting of Pantaleon can be found in the church of San Pantalon in Venice; it shows the saint healing a child. Another painting of Pantaleon by Fumiani is also in the same church. He was depicted in an 8th-century fresco in Santa Maria Antiqua in Rome, and in a 10th-century cycle of pictures in the crypt of San Crisogono in Rome. In Calabria, there is a small town named Papanice, after Pantaleon. Each year on his feast day, a statue of the saint is carried through the town to give a blessing for all those who seek it.\n\nSan Pantaleone or Pantalone was a popular saint in Venice, and he therefore gave his name to a character in the \"commedia dell'arte\", Pantalone, a silly, wizened old man (Shakespeare's \"lean and slippered Pantaloon\") who was a caricature of Venetians.

They each played a major role in influencing their husbands, who, along with their own positions of power, ultimately changed the course of Chinese history.\n\nTheir father was American-educated Methodist minister Charlie Soong, who made a fortune in banking and printing. Their mother was Ni Kwei-tseng (倪桂珍 \"Ní Guìzhēn\"), whose mother, Lady Xu, was a descendant of Ming dynasty mathematician and Jesuit convert Xu Guangqi. All three sisters attended Wesleyan College in Macon, Georgia, United States. Mei-ling, however, left Wesleyan and eventually graduated from Wellesley College in Massachusetts. Their three brothers were all high-ranking officials in the Republic of China government, one of whom was T. V. Soong.\n\nThroughout their lifetimes, each one of the sisters followed her own beliefs in terms of supporting the Kuomintang (KMT; Nationalists) or the Communists. In the 1930s, Soong Ai-ling and Mei-ling were the two richest women in China; both of them supported the Nationalists.\n\nIn 1937, when the Second Sino-Japanese war broke out, all three of them got together after a 10-year separation in an effort to unite the KMT and CPC against the Imperial Japanese army. Soong Ai-ling devoted herself to social work such as helping wounded soldiers, refugees and orphans. She donated five ambulances and 37 trucks to the army in Shanghai and the air force, along with 500 leather uniforms.\nWhen the Japanese occupied Nanjing and Wuhan, the three sisters moved to Hong Kong. In 1940, they returned to Chongqing and established the Chinese Industrial Cooperatives, which opened job opportunities for people through weaving, sewing and other crafts. The sisters frequently visited schools, hospitals, orphanages, air raid shelters and aided war torn communities along the way. While both parties failed to unite at the most critical time in the 1940s, the sisters made a valiant effort in financing and assisting in all national activities.\n\nTheir marriages and alleged motivations have been summarized in the Maoist saying \"One loved money, one loved power, one loved her country\" () referring to Ai-ling, Mei-ling, and Ching-ling in that order. \n\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "26233804", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=26233804", "title": "The Younger Lady", "text": "The Younger Lady\n\nThe Younger Lady is the informal name given to a mummy discovered in the Egyptian Valley of the Kings, in tomb KV35 by archaeologist Victor Loret in 1898. The mummy also has been given the designation KV35YL (\"YL\" for \"Younger Lady\") and 61072, and currently resides in the Egyptian Museum in Cairo. Through recent DNA tests this mummy has been identified as the mother of the Pharaoh Tutankhamun, and a daughter of Pharaoh Amenhotep III and Queen Tiye. Early speculation was that this mummy was the remains of Queen Nefertiti, which remains possible, but DNA tests have not confirmed this and questions about that possibility remain.\n\nThe mummy was found adjacent to two other mummies in KV35: a young boy who died at around the age of 10, thought to be Webensenu, and another, older woman, identified as Queen Tiye by the recent DNA studies on Tutankhamun's lineage. All were found together, lying naked side-by-side and unidentified in a small antechamber of the tomb. All three mummies had been extensively damaged by ancient tomb robbers.\n\nThere has been much speculation as to the identity of the Younger Lady mummy. Upon finding the mummy, Victor Loret initially believed it be that of a young man as the mummy's head had been shaved. A closer inspection later made by Dr. Grafton Elliot Smith confirmed that the mummy was that of a female, although Loret's original interpretation persisted for many years.\n\nRecently, autosomal and mitochondrial DNA tests have shown conclusively that the mummy is that of a female and that she was the mother of Tutankhamun. The results also show that she was a full-sister to her husband, the mummy from KV55, and that they were both the children of Amenhotep III and Queen Tiye. There is speculation over the identity of the mummy from KV55 (sister marriage existed), with some Egyptologists, including Zahi Hawass, claiming the mummy is Akhenaten, and others, including anthropologist Joyce Filer, claiming the mummy as Smenkhare. This family relationship would lessen the possibility that the Younger Lady (and, by extension, Tutankhamun's mother) was either Nefertiti, or Akhenaten's secondary wife Kiya, because no known artifact accords either wife titles such as \"King's sister\" or \"King's Daughter\". The possibility of the younger lady being Sitamun, Isis, or Henuttaneb is considered unlikely, as they were Great Royal Wives of their father Amenhotep III, and had Akhenaten married any of them, they would have taken the place of Nefertiti as the principal queen of Egypt. The report concludes that the mummy is likely to be Nebetah or Beketaten, daughters of Amenhotep III not known to have married their father, although he is known to have had eight daughters with Queen Tiye.\n\nThere is also a theory that the younger lady is Meritaten, daughter of Akhenaten and Nefertiti, and wife of Smenkhare, based on a study of the alleles inherited by Tutankhamun. The theory goes that Meritaten married Smenkhare, believed to be her uncle, thereby making Tutankhamun a maternal grandson of Akhenaten. The theory holds weight as inbreeding makes it harder to distinguish the generations, but there is one problem with this theory. Meritaten must be a mitochondrial descendant of Queen Tiye, or her mother Thuya, as the younger lady's mitochondrial DNA fits with her being Tiye's daughter. Nefertiti's lineage is nowhere specified, and if Meritaten is the younger lady, Nefertiti must be a mitochondrial relation of Thuya.\n\nIt has been suggested that, indeed, the Younger Lady is Nefertiti, as incest was not uncommon. This would mean that Akhenaten did marry his own sister and that he and Nefertiti are the parents of Tutankhamun. Furthermore, Nefertiti, who may have survived her husband, may be identical with Smenkhare and may have adopted this name if she took over the reign after Akhenaten's death (and having her daughter move into her official roles of chief priestess and 'wife'). All this is not proven, but should be mentioned as a further plausible scenario. One difficulty posed by this identification is the mummy's age at death, because Nefertiti gave birth to Meritaten no later than year 1 of Akhenaten's reign and there is evidence that she was still alive during year 16.\n\nGrafton Elliot Smith provided an extensive description of the mummy in his survey of the ancient royal mummies at the beginning of the twentieth century. He found the mummy to be in height, and judged her to have been no older than 25 years old at the time of death. He also noted the major damage done by ancient tomb robbers, who smashed the anterior wall of the mummy's chest, and had torn the right arm off just below the shoulder. Smith presumed that she was a member of the royal family.\n\nThe Younger Lady has a gaping wound in the left side of her mouth and cheek. It had been thought that this wound, which also destroyed part of the jaw, had been the result of actions of the tomb robbers, but a more recent re-examination of the mummy while it was undergoing genetic tests and CT scans determined that the wound had happened prior to death and that the injury had been lethal. Julian Heath suggests that the wound was likely the result of an axe blow. \n\nBelow her left breast there is another wound, likely to be the result of a stab wound. In 2003, a scientific team from University of York, working under Joann Fletcher, examined the mummy. A member of the team realized that the face wound could have been a premortem wound, and not a postmortem wound as previously assumed. Instead of the Younger Lady's remains simply being mutilated after her death by tomb robbers motivated by malice, it seemed likely the Lady had been injured while still alive. The conclusion was considered uncertain. At a later point, Ashraf Selim lent support to this theory. He noted that if the Younger Lady had been damaged following the embalming process, then bits of dried bone and flesh could be located in the mummy's wounds. Since no such findings occurred, he was certain that this was a pre-mortem wound. Further, Selim viewed the wound as too violent to be the result of an accident. The Lady had been injured in an act of deliberate violence. The Egyptian Mummy Project which used a CT scan to examine the mummy, located \"very few pieces of the relevant broken bones\" in the sinus cavity. They concluded that the Younger Lady's face had been damaged before the embalming process, and likely prior to her death. Indeed, the face wound was determined to be a probable cause of death for the Lady.\n\nThe missing right arm of the mummy was the cause of a minor controversy between researchers. Two severed arms had been located within KV35, and either one was thought likely to belong to the Younger Lady. One was a bent arm with a clenched fist, while the other was a straight arm. It was typical for female Egyptian mummies to be positioned with one of their arms bent and the other one in a straight position. The hand more likely to be positioned as bent was the left hand. The Egyptian Mummy Project of Ashraf Selim examined both arms to resolve the controversy. The bent arm was compared to the Younger Lady's attached left hand, and was found to be too long to belong to the same woman. The bones of the two compared arms were also found \"different in consistency\". The straight arm was then compared to the Younger Lady's left arm. It was found to be of similar length and similar bone density, so the Project concluded that the straight arm most likely did belong to the Younger Lady. The identified right arm of the Younger Lady has two breaks, \"one in the upper arm and one at the wrist\". The hand has been severed from the rest of the limb.\n\nA finding of lesser importance is that the Younger Lady has a double-pierced ear. Pierced ears were rather common for women of the New Kingdom of Egypt, including royals and nonroyal women. The Lady's pierced ear can not help researchers determine her identity or social position. Similarly inconclusive for identification purposes was the discovery of a wig in KV35, which could have belonged to the Younger Lady. Supporters of the theory identifying the Lady with Nefertiti, pointed to the wig's perceived similarities with the type of wigs used by Nefertiti. They are fashion items used by Egyptian women of the same era, they can not help us identify the wig's user with the Queen.\n\nFollowing the CT scan of the Younger Lady, more detailed descriptions of the mummy have been published. A large defect in the anterior wall of the Lady's chest, and the disarticulation of the right upper limb (arm) are the main indications that the body suffered mutilation by ancient tomb robbers. Otherwise the mummy has been fairly preserved. Despite previous disputes about the Lady's gender, the morphology of the skull and pelvis confirms that she was a human female (woman). The condition of the epiphyseal union and the closure of the cranial sutures suggest that the Lady was between 25 and 35-years-old at the time of her death. The Lady's height was 1,58 meters from the vertex to the heel. Her left humerus was 29.3 centimeters in length. Her left femur was 40.5 centimeters in length. Her left tibia was 35.2 centimeters in length.\n\nThe base of skull was found intact. The back of the skull cavity contains the shrunken and desiccated brain and dura mater of the Lady. There is no evidence of embalming material within the cranial cavity. Researchers located an oval defect in the skull. It is located in the central part of the frontal bone, in front of the coronal suture. The defect has sharp, beveled, and festooned edges. The lack of evidence for attempted healing or sclerosis indicate that the defect was caused by a postmortem alteration of the body, probably during the embalming process. The embalmers likely used a sharp instrument on the skull.\n\nThe left side of the lower face includes a large defect. The defect involves the Lady's left cheek, her left maxillary sinus, her alveolar process, and part of her left mandible. There are sharp edges in this bony defect, with no evidence of attempted healing or sclerosis. Fragments of the broken lateral wall of the left maxillary sinus were located within the antral cavity. Fragments for most of the Lady's fractured bones are missing, and were apparently not placed in her tomb.\n\nThe soft tissues located next to the facial defect were relatively thicker than the corresponding tissues on the intact and uninjured right side of her face. On top of the facial gap and partly beneath the remaining skin, there was located a rolled embalming pack. The composition of the pack is undetermined, though researchers consider it probable that is composed of linen which has been impregnated with resin. A similar substance was located on the right side of the face, particularly the cheek and the mid-face. More clearly identified packs of linen were located in the periphery of the Lady's orbits, placed in front of the globes of the eyes. Resin was also located in the Lady's right nasal cavity. The Lady's mouth is filled with linen. No embalming materials were placed within the Lady's throat.\n\nThe auricles of her ears were found in much different condition. Part of the right auricle is missing, and can not be used to determine her appearance in life. Her left auricle is in a better condition, and two piercings were located in its earlobe. The Lady had a double-pierced ear.\n\nThe Lady has several missing teeth due to her facial injury. Her left alveolar plate and part of her left jaw were fractured, explaining what happened to her teeth. One tooth is visible within her mouth. The fracture involved most of her left alveolar plate distal to the left first incisor. This incisor is among the missing teeth. The right alveolar plate is in a better condition, though the sockets of the first incisor and the right canine tooth are empty, with these teeth missing. The rest of the teeth are still present, including an nonerupted third molar (wisdom tooth).\n\nThe fracture of mandible involved the midline and the adjacent part of the left mandible. Her right and left first incisors and the left canine tooth were affected by this fracture. The sockets of the right second incisor, the left first molar, and the left second molar are empty, with these teeth missing. The first and second left upper molars are partially fractured. Both the right and the left upper third molars are nonerupted. Conversely, the Lady's upper right canine, premolars, first molar, and second molar are still present. This group of teeth has no visible attrition, and no occlusal irregularity of their surface.\n\nResearch on the Lady's spine located a smooth lateral curve on the lumbar region (lower spine), with a convexity towards the left. This is an indication of lumbar scoliosis. The limits of the curve have been determined. The upper limit is between the twelfth thoracic vertebra and the first lumbar vertebra. The lower limit is between the fourth and fifth lumbar vertebrae. The center of the curve is between the second and third lumbar vertebrae. The scoliosis of the Lady is mild, with a Cobb angle of less than 20°. Researchers found no evidence of structural abnormalities in the vertebrae, no fractures, and no congenital anomalies (birth defects). The researchers suspect that the Lady may not have actually suffered from scoliosis while still alive. The curved spine of the mummy may be a postmortem condition, resulting from the position of the body during the mummification process.\n\nThere is a large defect in the anterior wall of the Lady's torso. The viscera (internal organs) were removed by the mummy's embalmers, with the exception of the Lady's heart which is still visible within the body. The heart was apparently never moved. The embalming incision has been located in the left inguinal region. This tissue gap is 56 millimetres in length and 135 millimetres in depth. The torso contains both linen fibers which were mildly smeared with resin, and with linen packs treated with resin. One of the resin-treated linen packs was placed within the pelvis. The pelvic floor has a large defect, possibly used during the mummification process to remove the viscera. This would be an example of perineal evisceration.\n\nThe left upper limb (arm) of the Lady extends beside her body, with the hand placed over the left hip. There is a complete transverse fracture of the proximal portion of the shaft, in the right humerus. The fracture has gaping ends. There is no evidence of attempted healing or for the formation of a callus in this area. The disarticulated right upper limb (arm) has been placed beside the body. The right hand has been broken and completely separated from the wrist. This hand has been placed at the feet of the mummy.\n\nThe lower limbs (human legs) have also been damaged. The left iliac crest contains small fractures. The inferior pubic ramus also contains similar fractures. Due to the lack of evidence of healing, it is likely that all these fractures were part of the postmortem damage to the Lady's body. The right tibia has a defective area at the front of the distal shaft. The defective area extends 33.5 millimetres above the ankle joint. The metatarsal bones of both feet are broken, and missing from the body. The phalanx bones of both feet are also missing. There is a subcutaneous (hypodermic) filling at the back of the Lady's right hip region, where her buttock is located.\n\nResearchers have noted some peculiarities in the mummification process used on the Lady. The evisceration of the body and the stuffing of the torso with embalming materials were standard parts of the mummification process used during the entire reign of the 18th dynasty. This was not the case with the intact skull base and lack of effort to remove the brain, seen in the case of the Lady. This process had been used on early rulers of the 18th dynasty, as seen in the mummies currently identified with Thutmose I, Thutmose II, and Thutmose III. By the time of the later rulers of the 18th dynasty, when the Lady lived and died, the process had changed. All mummies from this later era contain some treatment of the brain, in attempts to remove it from the body. The mummification process used on the Lady seems like a throwback to an earlier era. Another peculiarity is the evidence that the people behind the mummification process were trying to repair and cover injured areas of the body. They used subcutaneous fillings and packs to remodel the injured left side of the face, the contralateral side of the face, and the right hip region. This was not part of the regular efforts of an embalmer.\n\nThe results of the CT scan support the idea that the Lady's facial injury took place prior to her mummification. The researchers consider this to have been a perimortem injury, happening either shortly before the Lady's death or following her death; in the short period between the death and the mummification. Either way the embalmers would have started work on an already damaged body. The lack of signs of healing would support the idea that the Lady received a mortal wound, and her body had no time to attempt recovery. The nature of the injury, however, could not be fully determined. The small fragments of bone found within the maxillary antral sinus, at least indicate the direction of the trauma. Something was \"pushing\" the bones within, rather than \"pulling\" them out. A heavy object hitting the Lady's face would have such an effect. If not an intentional act, an accident involving the Lady receiving a strong kick from an animal would have the same result. A horse would have sufficient strength to kill with its kicks. In any case, an acute facial trauma to a living woman would cause severe shock and bleeding. Then this shock and the bleeding would likely cause her death.\n\nWhile the CT scan researchers thought the Lady's death likely to be violent or accidental, they were less certain of what caused the skull defect and the defect in the anterior wall of the body. Whether they were perimortem or postmortem injuries to the body could not be determined. They could be the result of the same mysterious lethal incident as the facial injury, or caused long after the Lady's death by the ancient tomb robbers.\n\nHermann Schögl, a Swiss Egyptologist, agrees with the medical and DNA findings of the teams working under Zahi Hawass, but disputes several of the identifications of the royal and noble mummies. Schögl agrees that the head injuries which the Lady received were lethal, and has suggested that she was killed in a chariot accident. Schögl believes that the Younger Lady is Nefertiti, and that she was killed in a chariot accident during regnal year 14 of Akhenaten's reign. However, the archaeological findings from Akhenaten's reign seem to indicate that Nefertiti was still alive during regnal year 16, two years following the date Schögl has chosen for her death. Marianne Eaton-Krauss, another Egyptologist, finds Schögl's alternative royal genealogy for the 18th dynasty and his attempted reconstruction of the final years of Akhenaten's reign to be rather unconvincing.\n\nNatalia Klimczack, a historian and journalist, reports that several Egyptologists consider it likely that the Younger Lady may be Kiya. Kiya was one of Akhenaten's queens, but disappears from the historical record by regnal year 12 or 13 of Akhenaten's reign. Her time of death is not indicated in the primary sources. As Aidan Dodson, an Egyptologist, has pointed out, several of the monuments and objects originally dedicated to Kiya were later usurped by other royals. A Pharaoh whose identity is unclear was buried in Kiya's coffin instead of her. Relief representations of Kiya were altered to instead depict Meritaten and/or Ankhesenamun. To Aiden this suggests that Kiya had fallen from grace, and that there was an effort to erase her from the historical record. The premortem facial injury of the Younger Lady would fit this theory. The Lady did not die of natural causes, the facial injury indicates that she was murdered. If she was Kiya, this would explain her sudden disappearance from the historical record and efforts to remove her depictions in it.\n\nMarianne Eaton-Krauss has called attention to the apparent absence of the Younger Lady, as Tutankhamun/Tutankhaten's mother, from the available historical record of Ancient Egypt. As of the 2010s, nobody has been able to find an inscription, a relief, or a statue dedicated to this young Pharaoh's mother. KV62, the tomb of Tutankhamun, contains memorabilia from his life and reign. None of these items ever mentions his mother.\n\nThere is a contrast between the Younger Lady and a number of influential queen mothers from the later reigns of the 18th dynasty, who had a large presence in the reigns of their sons. Tiaa served as queen mother to Thutmose IV, Mutemwiya as queen mother to Amenhotep III, and Tiye as queen mother to Akhenaten. It seems likely that Tutankhamun/Tutankhaten never had a queen mother, indicating that the Younger Lady (or any other mother) had died before his rise to the throne.\n\nDespite the Younger Lady being daughter to a Pharaoh (Amenhotep III), full sister and probable wife to a second Pharaoh (Akhenaten), and mother to a third Pharaoh (Tutankhamun/Tutankhaten), she herself does not appear to have been a prominent figure in her lifetime. Willeke Wendrich, an Egyptologist, considers it likely that the Lady was a minor wife or a concubine to Akhenaten, rather than his Queen. Wendrich notes that the Pharaohs of Egypt typically had multiple wives. This often resulted in multiple sons serving as viable heirs to the throne, and potential competition between the sons to gain the right to succeed their father.\n\nOn 7 February 2018, The Younger Lady was featured on the 7th episode of the 4th season of Expedition Unknown titled Great Women of Ancient Egypt. On the assumption that she is indeed to be identified as Neferititi and using preserved remains, modern technology and artistry, a team led by Expedition Unknown's host Josh Gates presented a reconstruction of what The Younger Lady would have looked like in her full royal regalia. The bust was created by French paleoartist Élisabeth Daynès.\n\n"}

{"id": "3543130", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=3543130", "title": "Underwater diving", "text": "Underwater diving\n\nUnderwater diving, as a human activity, is the practice of descending below the water's surface to interact with the environment.\nImmersion in water and exposure to high ambient pressure have physiological effects that limit the depths and duration possible in ambient pressure diving. Humans are not physiologically and anatomically well adapted to the environmental conditions of diving, and various equipment has been developed to extend the depth and duration of human dives, and allow different types of work to be done.\n\nIn ambient pressure diving, the diver is directly exposed to the pressure of the surrounding water. The ambient pressure diver may dive on breath-hold, or use breathing apparatus for scuba diving or surface-supplied diving, and the saturation diving technique reduces the risk of decompression sickness (DCS) after long-duration deep dives. Atmospheric diving suits (ADS) may be used to isolate the diver from high ambient pressure. Crewed submersibles can extend depth range, and remotely controlled or robotic machines can reduce risk to humans.\n\nThe environment exposes the diver to a wide range of hazards, and though the risks are largely controlled by appropriate diving skills, training, types of equipment and breathing gases used depending on the mode, depth and purpose of diving, it remains a relatively dangerous activity. \nDiving activities are restricted to maximum depths of about for recreational scuba diving, for commercial saturation diving, and wearing atmospheric suits. Diving is also restricted to conditions which are not excessively hazardous, though the level of risk acceptable can vary.\n\nRecreational diving (sometimes called sport diving or subaquatics) is a popular leisure activity. Technical diving is a form of recreational diving under especially challenging conditions. Professional diving (commercial diving, diving for research purposes, or for financial gain) involves working underwater. Public safety diving is the underwater work done by law enforcement, fire rescue, and underwater search and recovery dive teams. Military diving includes combat diving, clearance diving and ships husbandry.\n\"Deep sea diving\" is underwater diving, usually with surface-supplied equipment, and often refers to the use of standard diving dress with the traditional copper helmet. \"Hard hat\" diving is any form of diving with a helmet, including the standard copper helmet, and other forms of free-flow and lightweight demand helmets.\nThe history of breath-hold diving goes back at least to classical times, and there is evidence of prehistoric hunting and gathering of seafoods that may have involved underwater swimming. Technical advances allowing the provision of breathing gas to a diver underwater at ambient pressure are recent, and self-contained breathing systems developed at an accelerated rate following the Second World War.\n\nImmersion in water and exposure to cold water and high pressure have physiological effects on the diver which limit the depths and duration possible in ambient pressure diving. Breath-hold endurance is a severe limitation, and breathing at high ambient pressure adds further complications, both directly and indirectly. Technological solutions have been developed which can greatly extend depth and duration of human ambient pressure dives, and allow useful work to be done underwater.\n\nImmersion of the human body in water affects the circulation, renal system, fluid balance, and breathing, because the external hydrostatic pressure of the water provides support against the internal hydrostatic pressure of the blood. This causes a blood shift from the extravascular tissues of the limbs into the chest cavity, and fluid losses known as immersion diuresis compensate for the blood shift in hydrated subjects soon after immersion. Hydrostatic pressure on the body from head-out immersion causes negative pressure breathing which contributes to the blood shift.\n\nThe blood shift causes an increased respiratory and cardiac workload. Stroke volume is not greatly affected by immersion or variation in ambient pressure, but slowed heartbeat reduces the overall cardiac output, particularly because of the diving reflex in breath-hold diving. Lung volume decreases in the upright position, owing to cranial displacement of the abdomen from hydrostatic pressure, and resistance to air flow in the airways increases because of the decrease in lung volume. There appears to be a connection between pulmonary edema and increased pulmonary blood flow and pressure, which results in capillary engorgement. This may occur during higher intensity exercise while immersed or submerged.\n\nCold shock response is the physiological response of organisms to sudden cold, especially cold water, and is a common cause of death from immersion in very cold water, such as by falling through thin ice. The immediate shock of the cold causes involuntary inhalation, which if underwater can result in drowning. The cold water can also cause heart attack due to vasoconstriction; the heart has to work harder to pump the same volume of blood throughout the body, and for people with heart disease, this additional workload can cause the heart to go into arrest. A person who survives the initial minute after falling into cold water can survive for at least thirty minutes provided they do not drown. The ability to stay afloat declines substantially after about ten minutes as the chilled muscles lose strength and co-ordination.\n\nThe diving reflex is a response to immersion that overrides the basic homeostatic reflexes. It optimises respiration by preferentially distributing oxygen stores to the heart and brain, which allows extended periods underwater. It is exhibited strongly in aquatic mammals (seals, otters, dolphins and muskrats), and also exists in other mammals, including humans. Diving birds, such as penguins, have a similar diving reflex. The diving reflex is triggered by chilling the face and holding the breath. The cardiovascular system constricts peripheral blood vessels, slows the pulse rate, redirects blood to the vital organs to conserve oxygen, releases red blood cells stored in the spleen, and, in humans, causes heart rhythm irregularities. Aquatic mammals have evolved physiological adaptations to conserve oxygen during submersion, but apnea, slowed pulse rate, and vasoconstriction are shared with terrestrial mammals.\n\nHypothermia is reduced body temperature that happens when a body loses more heat than it generates. Hypothermia is a major limitation to swimming or diving in cold water. The reduction in finger dexterity due to pain or numbness decreases general safety and work capacity, which in turn increases the risk of other injuries. Body heat is lost much more quickly in water than in air, so water temperatures that would be tolerable as outdoor air temperatures can lead to hypothermia, which may lead to death from other causes in inadequately protected divers.\n\nBreath-hold diving by an air-breathing animal is limited to the physiological capacity to perform the dive on the oxygen available until it returns to a source of fresh breathing gas, usually the air at the surface. As this internal oxygen supply reduces, the animal experiences an increasing urge to breathe caused by buildup of carbon dioxide and lactate in the blood, followed by loss of consciousness due to central nervous system hypoxia. If this occurs underwater, it will drown.\n\nBlackouts in freediving can occur when the breath is held long enough for metabolic activity to reduce the oxygen partial pressure sufficiently to cause loss of consciousness. This is accelerated by exertion, which uses oxygen faster, or by hyperventilation, which reduces the carbon dioxide level in the blood. Lower carbon dioxide levels increase the oxygen-haemoglobin affinity, reducing availability of oxygen to brain tissue towards the end of the dive (Bohr effect); they also suppress the urge to breathe, making it easier to hold the breath to the point of blackout. This can happen at any depth.\n\nAscent-induced hypoxia is caused by a drop in oxygen partial pressure as ambient pressure is reduced. The partial pressure of oxygen at depth may be sufficient to maintain consciousness but only at that depth and not at the reduced pressures nearer the surface.\n\nBarotrauma, an example of dysbarism, is physical damage to body tissues caused by a difference in pressure between a gas space inside, or in contact with the body, and the surrounding gas or fluid. It typically occurs when the organism is exposed to a large change in ambient pressure, such as when a diver ascends or descends. When diving, the pressure differences which cause the barotrauma are changes in hydrostatic pressure.\n\nThe initial damage is usually due to over-stretching the tissues in tension or shear, either directly by expansion of the gas in the closed space, or by pressure difference hydrostatically transmitted through the tissue.\n\nBarotrauma generally manifests as sinus or middle ear effects, DCS, lung overpressure injuries, and injuries resulting from external squeezes. Barotraumas of descent are caused by preventing the free change of volume of the gas in a closed space in contact with the diver, resulting in a pressure difference between the tissues and the gas space, and the unbalanced force due to this pressure difference causes deformation of the tissues resulting in cell rupture. Barotraumas of ascent are also caused when the free change of volume of the gas in a closed space in contact with the diver is prevented. In this case the pressure difference causes a resultant tension in the surrounding tissues which exceeds their tensile strength. Besides tissue rupture, the overpressure may cause ingress of gases into the tissues and further afield through the circulatory system. This can cause blockage of circulation at distant sites, or interfere with the normal function of an organ by its presence.\n\nProvision of breathing gas at ambient pressure can greatly prolong the duration of a dive, but there are other problems that may result from this technological solution. Absorption of metabolically inert gases is increased as a function of time and pressure, and these may both produce undesirable effects immediately, as a consequence of their presence in the tissues in the dissolved state, such as nitrogen narcosis and high pressure nervous syndrome, or cause problems when coming out of solution within the tissues during decompression.\n\nOther problems arise when the concentration of metabolically active gases is increased. These range from the toxic effects of oxygen at high partial pressure, through buildup of carbon dioxide due to excessive work of breathing, increased dead space, or inefficient removal, to the exacerbation of the toxic effects of contaminants in the breathing gas due to the increased concentration at high pressures. Hydrostatic pressure differences between the interior of the lung and the breathing gas delivery, increased breathing gas density due to ambient pressure, and increased flow resistance due to higher breathing rates may all cause increased work of breathing and fatigue of the respiratory muscles.\n\nUnderwater vision is affected by the clarity and the refractive index of the medium. Visibility underwater is reduced because light passing through water attenuates rapidly with distance, leading to lower levels of natural illumination. Underwater objects are also blurred by scattering of light between the object and the viewer, resulting in lower contrast. These effects vary with the wavelength of the light, and the colour and turbidity of the water. The human eye is optimised for air vision, and when it is immersed in direct contact with water, visual acuity is adversely affected by the difference in refractive index between water and air. Provision of an airspace between the cornea and the water can compensate, but causes scale and distance distortion. Artificial illumination can improve visibility at short range. Stereoscopic acuity, the ability to judge relative distances of different objects, is considerably reduced underwater, and this is affected by the field of vision. A narrow field of vision caused by a small viewport in a helmet results in greatly reduced stereoacuity, and an apparent movement of a stationary object when the head is moved. These effects lead to poorer hand-eye coordination.\nWater has different acoustic properties from those of air. Sound from an underwater source can propagate relatively freely through body tissues where there is contact with the water as the acoustic properties are similar. When the head is exposed to the water, some sound is transmitted by the eardrum and middle ear, but a significant part reaches the cochlea independently, by bone conduction. Some sound localisation is possible, though difficult. Human hearing underwater, in cases where the diver's ear is wet, is less sensitive than in air. Frequency sensitivity underwater also differs from that in air, with a consistently higher threshold of hearing underwater; sensitivity to higher frequency sounds is reduced the most. The type of headgear affects noise sensitivity and noise hazard depending on whether transmission is wet or dry. Human hearing underwater is less sensitive with wet ears than in air, and a neoprene hood causes substantial attenuation. When wearing a helmet, hearing sensitivity is similar to that in surface air, as it is not greatly affected by the breathing gas or chamber atmosphere composition or pressure. Because sound travels faster in heliox than in air, voice formants are raised, making divers' speech high-pitched and distorted, and hard to understand for people not used to it. The increased density of breathing gases under pressure has a similar and additive effect.\nTactile sensory perception in divers may be impaired by the environmental protection suit and low temperatures. The combination of instability, equipment, neutral buoyancy and resistance to movement by the inertial and viscous effects of the water encumbers the diver. Cold causes losses in sensory and motor function and distracts from and disrupts cognitive activity. The ability to exert large and precise force is reduced.\nBalance and equilibrium depend on vestibular function and secondary input from visual, organic, cutaneous, kinesthetic and sometimes auditory senses which are processed by the central nervous system to provide the sense of balance. Underwater, some of these inputs may be absent or diminished, making the remaining cues more important. Conflicting input may result in vertigo, disorientation and motion sickness. The vestibular sense is essential in these conditions for rapid, intricate and accurate movement.Proprioceptive perception makes the diver aware of personal position and movement, in association with the vestibular and visual input, and allows the diver to function effectively in maintaining physical equilibrium and balance in the water. In the water at neutral buoyancy, the proprioceptive cues of position are reduced or absent. This effect may be exacerbated by the diver's suit and other equipment.\nTaste and smell are not very important to the diver in the water but more important to the saturation diver while in accommodation chambers. There is evidence of a slight decrease in threshold for taste and smell after extended periods under pressure.\n\nThere are several modes of diving based on the diving equipment used.\n\nThe ability to dive and swim underwater while holding one's breath is considered a useful emergency skill, an important part of water sport and Navy safety training, and an enjoyable leisure activity. Underwater diving without breathing apparatus can be categorised as underwater swimming, snorkelling and freediving. These categories overlap considerably. Several competitive underwater sports are practised without breathing apparatus.\n\nFreediving precludes the use of external breathing devices, and relies on the ability of divers to hold their breath until resurfacing. The technique ranges from simple breath-hold diving to competitive apnea dives. Fins and a diving mask are often used in free diving to improve vision and provide more efficient propulsion. A short breathing tube called a snorkel allows the diver to breathe at the surface while the face is immersed. Snorkelling on the surface with no intention of diving is a popular water sport and recreational activity.\n\nScuba diving is diving with a self-contained underwater breathing apparatus, which is completely independent of surface supply. Scuba gives the diver mobility and horizontal range far beyond the reach of an umbilical hose attached to surface-supplied diving equipment (SSDE).\nScuba divers engaged in armed forces covert operations may be referred to as frogmen, combat divers or attack swimmers.\n\nOpen circuit scuba systems discharge the breathing gas into the environment as it is exhaled, and consist of one or more diving cylinders containing breathing gas at high pressure which is supplied to the diver through a diving regulator. They may include additional cylinders for decompression gas or emergency breathing gas.\n\nClosed-circuit or semi-closed circuit rebreather scuba systems allow recycling of exhaled gases. The volume of gas used is reduced compared to that of open circuit, so a smaller cylinder or cylinders may be used for an equivalent dive duration. They far extend the time spent underwater as compared to open circuit for the same gas consumption. Rebreathers produce fewer bubbles and less noise than scuba which makes them attractive to covert military divers to avoid detection, scientific divers to avoid disturbing marine animals, and media divers to avoid bubble interference.\n\nA scuba diver moves underwater by using fins attached to the feet; external propulsion can be provided by a diver propulsion vehicle, or a towboard pulled from the surface. Other equipment includes a diving mask to improve underwater vision, a protective diving suit, equipment to control buoyancy, and equipment related to the specific circumstances and purpose of the dive. Scuba divers are trained in the procedures and skills appropriate to their level of certification by instructors affiliated to the diver certification organisations which issue these diver certifications. These include standard operating procedures for using the equipment and dealing with the general hazards of the underwater environment, and emergency procedures for self-help and assistance of a similarly equipped diver experiencing problems. A minimum level of fitness and health is required by most training organisations, and a higher level of fitness may be needed for some applications.\n\nAn alternative to self-contained breathing systems is to supply breathing gases from the surface through a hose. When combined with a communication cable, a pneumofathometer hose and a safety line it is called the diver's umbilical, which may include a hot water hose for heating, video cable and breathing gas reclaim line. More basic equipment that uses only an air hose is called an airline or hookah system. This allows the diver to breathe using an air supply hose from a cylinder or compressor at the surface. Breathing gas is supplied through a mouth-held demand valve or light full-face mask. It is used for work such as hull cleaning and archaeological surveys, for shellfish harvesting, and as snuba, a shallow water activity typically practised by tourists and those who are not scuba-certified.\n\nSaturation diving lets professional divers live and work under pressure for days or weeks at a time. After working in the water, the divers rest and live in a dry pressurised underwater habitat on the bottom or a saturation life support system of pressure chambers on the deck of a diving support vessel, oil platform or other floating platform at a similar pressure to the work depth. They are transferred between the surface accommodation and the underwater workplace in a pressurised closed diving bell. Decompression at the end of the dive may take many days, but since it is done only once for a long period of exposure, rather than after each of many shorter exposures, the overall risk of decompression injury to the diver and the total time spent decompressing are reduced. This type of diving allows greater work efficiency and safety.\n\nCommercial divers refer to diving operations where the diver starts and finishes the diving operation at atmospheric pressure as surface oriented, or bounce diving. The diver may be deployed from the shore or a diving support vessel and may be transported on a diving or in a diving bell. Surface-supplied divers almost always wear diving helmets or full face diving masks. The bottom gas can be air, nitrox, heliox or trimix; the decompression gases may be similar, or may include pure oxygen. Decompression procedures include in-water decompression or surface decompression in a deck chamber.\n\nA wet bell with a gas filled dome provides more comfort and control than a stage and allows for longer time in water. Wet bells are used for air and mixed gas, and divers can decompress on oxygen at . Small closed bell systems have been designed that can be easily mobilised, and include a two-man bell, a handling frame and a chamber for decompression after transfer under pressure (TUP). Divers can breathe air or mixed gas at the bottom and are usually recovered with the chamber filled with air. They decompress on oxygen supplied through built in breathing systems (BIBS) towards the end of the decompression. Small bell systems support bounce diving down to and for bottom times up to 2 hours.\n\nA relatively portable surface gas supply system using high pressure gas cylinders for both primary and reserve gas, but using the full diver's umbilical system with pneumofathometer and voice communication, is known in the industry as \"scuba replacement\".\n\nCompressor diving is a rudimentary method of surface-supplied diving used in some tropical regions such as the Philippines and the Caribbean. The divers swim with a half mask and fins and are supplied with air from an industrial low-pressure air compressor on the boat through plastic tubes. There is no reduction valve; the diver holds the hose end in his mouth with no demand valve or mouthpiece and allows excess air to spill out between the lips.\n\nSubmersibles and rigid atmospheric diving suits (ADS) enable diving to be carried out in a dry environment at normal atmospheric pressure. An ADS is a small one-person articulated submersible which resembles a suit of armour, with elaborate joints to allow bending, while maintaining an internal pressure of one atmosphere. An ADS can be used for dives of up to about for many hours. It eliminates the majority of physiological dangers associated with deep diving – the occupant need not decompress, there is no need for special gas mixtures, and there is no danger of nitrogen narcosis – at the expense of higher cost, complex logistics and loss of dexterity.\n\nAutonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) and remotely operated underwater vehicles (ROVs) can carry out some functions of divers. They can be deployed at greater depths and in more dangerous environments. An AUV is a robot which travels underwater without requiring real-time input from an operator. AUVs constitute part of a larger group of unmanned undersea systems, a classification that includes non-autonomous ROVs, which are controlled and powered from the surface by an operator/pilot via an umbilical or using remote control. In military applications AUVs are often referred to as unmanned undersea vehicles (UUVs).\n\nDiving may be performed for various reasons, both personal and professional. Recreational diving is purely for enjoyment and has several specialisations and technical disciplines to provide more scope for varied activities for which specialist training can be offered, such as cave diving, wreck diving, ice diving and deep diving.\n\nThere are various aspects of professional diving that range from part-time work to lifelong careers. Professionals in the recreational dive industry include instructor trainers, dive instructors, assistant instructors, divemasters, dive guides, and scuba technicians. Commercial diving is industry related and includes civil engineering tasks such as in oil exploration, offshore construction, dam maintenance and harbour works. Commercial divers may also be employed to perform tasks related to marine activities, such as naval diving, including the repair and inspection of boats and ships, marine salvage or aquaculture.\n\nOther specialist areas of diving include military diving, with a long history of military frogmen in various roles. They can perform roles including direct combat, infiltration behind enemy lines, placing mines, bomb disposal or engineering operations.\n\nIn civilian operations, police forces keep police diving units to perform search and rescue operations, and to recover evidence. In some cases diver rescue teams may also be part of a fire department, paramedical service or lifeguard unit, and this may be classed as public safety diving. There are also professional divers such as underwater photographers and videographers, who record the underwater world, and scientific divers in fields of study which involve the underwater environment, including marine biologists, geologists, hydrologists, oceanographers and underwater archaeologists.\n\nThe choice between scuba and surface-supplied diving equipment is based on both legal and logistical constraints. Where the diver requires mobility and a large range of movement, scuba is usually the choice if safety and legal constraints allow. Higher risk work, particularly commercial diving, may be restricted to surface-supplied equipment by legislation and codes of practice.\n\nFreediving as a widespread means of hunting and gathering, both for food and other valuable resources such as pearls and coral, dates from before 4500 BCE. By classical Greek and Roman times commercial diving applications such as sponge diving and marine salvage were established. Military diving goes back at least as far as the Peloponnesian War, with recreational and sporting applications being a recent development. Technological development in ambient pressure diving started with stone weights (skandalopetra) for fast descent. The diving bell is one of the earliest types of equipment for underwater work and exploration. Its use was first described by Aristotle in the 4th century BCE. In the 16th and 17th centuries CE, diving bells became more useful when a renewable supply of air could be provided to the diver at depth, and progressed to surface-supplied diving helmets – in effect miniature diving bells covering the diver's head and supplied with compressed air by manually operated pumps – which were improved by attaching a waterproof suit to the helmet. In the early 19th century these became the standard diving dress, which made a far wider range of marine civil engineering and salvage projects practicable.\n\nLimitations in mobility of the surface-supplied systems encouraged the development of both open circuit and closed circuit scuba in the 20th century, which allow the diver a much greater autonomy. These became popular during the Second World War for clandestine military operations, and post-war for scientific, search and rescue, media diving, recreational and technical diving. The heavy free-flow surface-supplied copper helmets evolved into lightweight demand helmets, which are more economical with breathing gas, important for deeper dives using expensive helium based breathing mixtures. Saturation diving reduced the risks of DCS for deep and long exposures.\n\nAn alternative approach was the development of the ADS or armoured suit, which isolates the diver from the pressure at depth, at the cost of mechanical complexity and limited dexterity. The technology first became practicable in the middle 20th century. Isolation of the diver from the environment was taken further by the development of remotely operated underwater vehicles in the late 20th century, where the operator controls the ROV from the surface, and autonomous underwater vehicles, which dispense with an operator altogether. All of these modes are still in use and each has a range of applications where it has advantages over the others, though diving bells have largely been relegated to a means of transport for surface-supplied divers. In some cases combinations are particularly effective, such as the simultaneous use of surface orientated or saturation surface-supplied diving equipment and work or observation class remotely operated vehicles.\n\nBy the late 19th century, as salvage operations became deeper and longer, an unexplained malady began afflicting the divers; they would suffer breathing difficulties, dizziness, joint pain and paralysis, sometimes leading to death. The problem was already well known among workers building tunnels and bridge footings operating under pressure in caissons and was initially called \"caisson disease\"; it was later renamed \"the bends\" because the joint pain typically caused the sufferer to stoop. Early reports of the disease had been made at the time of Charles Pasley's salvage operation, but scientists were still ignorant of its causes.\n\nFrench physiologist Paul Bert was the first to understand it as DCS. His work, \"La Pression barométrique\" (1878), was a comprehensive investigation into the physiological effects of air pressure, both above and below the normal. He determined that inhaling pressurised air caused nitrogen to dissolve into the bloodstream; rapid depressurisation would then release the nitrogen into its gaseous state, forming bubbles that could block the blood circulation and potentially cause paralysis or death. Central nervous system oxygen toxicity was also first described in this publication and is sometimes referred to as the \"Paul Bert effect\".\n\nJohn Scott Haldane designed a decompression chamber in 1907, and he produced the first decompression tables for the Royal Navy in 1908 after extensive experiments with animals and human subjects. These tables established a method of decompression in stages – it remains the basis for decompression methods to this day. Following Haldane's recommendation, the maximum safe operating depth for divers was extended to .\n\nThe US Navy continued research into decompression, and in 1915 the first Bureau of Construction and Repair decompression tables were developed by French and Stilson. Experimental dives were conducted in the 1930s, forming the basis for the 1937 US Navy air decompression tables. Surface decompression and oxygen use were also researched in the 1930s. The US Navy 1957 tables were developed to correct problems found in the 1937 tables.\n\nIn 1965 Hugh LeMessurier and Brian Andrew Hills published their paper, \"A thermodynamic approach arising from a study on Torres Strait diving techniques\", which suggested that decompression following schedules based on conventional models results in asymptomatic bubble formation which must then be re-dissolved at the decompression stops before it can be eliminated. This is slower than allowing the gas to be eliminated while it is still in solution, and indicates the importance of minimising bubble phase gas for efficient decompression.\n\nM.P. Spencer showed that Doppler ultrasonic methods can detect venous bubbles in asymptomatic divers, and Dr Andrew Pilmanis showed that safety stops reduced bubble formation. In 1981 D.E. Yount described the Varying Permeability Model, proposing a mechanism of bubble formation. Several other bubble models followed. The pathophysiology of DCS is not yet fully understood, but decompression practice has reached a stage where the risk is fairly low, and most incidences are successfully treated by therapeutic recompression and hyperbaric oxygen therapy. Mixed breathing gases are used to reduce the effects of the hyperbaric environment on ambient pressure divers.\n\nThe diving environment is limited by accessibility and risk, but includes water and occasionally other liquids. Most underwater diving is done in the shallower coastal parts of the oceans, and inland bodies of fresh water, including lakes, dams, quarries, rivers, springs, flooded caves, reservoirs, tanks, swimming pools, and canals, but may also be done in large bore ducting and sewers, power station cooling systems, cargo and ballast tanks of ships, and liquid-filled industrial equipment. The environment may affect gear configuration: for instance, freshwater is less dense than saltwater, so less added weight is needed to achieve diver neutral buoyancy in freshwater dives. Water temperature, visibility and movement also affect the diver and the dive plan. Diving in liquids other than water may present special problems due to density, viscosity and chemical compatibility of diving equipment, as well as possible environmental hazards to the diving team.\n\nBenign conditions, sometimes also referred to as confined water, are environments of low risk, where it is extremely unlikely or impossible for the diver to get lost or entrapped, or be exposed to hazards other than the basic underwater environment. These conditions are suitable for initial training in the critical survival skills, and include swimming pools, training tanks, aquarium tanks and some shallow and protected shoreline areas.\n\nOpen water is unrestricted water such as a sea, lake or flooded quarry, where the diver has direct vertical access to the surface of the water in contact with the atmosphere. Open water diving implies that if a problem arises, the diver can directly ascend vertically to the atmosphere to breathe air. Wall diving is done along a near vertical face. Blue-water diving is done in mid-water where the bottom is out of sight of the diver and there may be no fixed visual reference.\n\nAn overhead or penetration diving environment is where the diver enters a space from which there is no direct, purely vertical ascent to the safety of breathable atmosphere at the surface. Cave diving, wreck diving, ice diving and diving inside other natural or artificial underwater structures or enclosures are examples. The restriction on direct ascent increases the risk of diving under an overhead, and this is usually addressed by adaptations of procedures and use of equipment such as redundant breathing gas sources and guide lines to indicate the route to the exit.\n\nNight diving can allow the diver to experience a different underwater environment, because many marine animals are nocturnal. Altitude diving, for example in mountain lakes, requires modifications to the decompression schedule because of the reduced atmospheric pressure.\n\nThe recreational diving depth limit set by the EN 14153-2 / ISO 24801-2 level 2 \"Autonomous Diver\" standard is . The recommended depth limit for more extensively trained recreational divers ranges from for PADI divers, (this is the depth at which nitrogen narcosis symptoms generally begin to be noticeable in adults), specified by Recreational Scuba Training Council, for divers of the British Sub-Aqua Club and Sub-Aqua Association breathing air, and for teams of 2 to 3 French Level 3 recreational divers, breathing air.\n\nFor technical divers, the recommended maximum depths are greater on the understanding that they will use less narcotic gas mixtures. is the maximum depth authorised for divers who have completed Trimix Diver certification with IANTD or Advanced Trimix Diver certification with TDI. is the world record depth on scuba (2014). Commercial divers using saturation techniques and heliox breathing gases routinely exceed , but they are also limited by physiological constraints. Comex Hydra 8 experimental dives reached a record open water depth of in 1988. ADS are mainly constrained by the technology of the articulation seals, and a US Navy diver has dived to in one.\n\nThe common term for a place at which one may dive is a dive site. As a general rule, professional diving is done where the work needs to be done, and recreational diving is done where conditions are suitable. There are many recorded and publicised recreational dive sites which are known for their convenience, points of interest, and frequently favourable conditions. Diver training facilities for both professional and recreational divers generally use a small range of dive sites which are familiar and convenient, and where conditions are predictable and the risk is relatively low.\n\nDue to the inherent risks of the environment and the necessity to operate the equipment correctly, both under normal conditions and during incidents where failure to respond appropriately and quickly can have fatal consequences, a set of standard procedures are used in preparation of the equipment, preparation to dive, during the dive if all goes according to plan, after the dive, and in the event of a reasonably foreseeable contingency. The standard procedures are not necessarily the only course of action that will have a satisfactory outcome, but they are generally those procedures which have been found by experiment and experience to work well and reliably when applied in response to the given circumstances. All formal diver training is based on the learning of standard skills and procedures, and in many cases the over-learning of the skills until the procedures can be performed without hesitation even when distracting circumstances exist. Where reasonably practicable, checklists may be used to ensure that preparatory procedures are carried out in the correct sequence and that no steps are inadvertently omitted.\n\nSome procedures are common to all manned modes of diving, but most are specific to the mode of diving and many are specific to the equipment in use. Diving procedures are those which are directly relevant to diving safety and efficiency, but do not include task specific skills. Standard procedures are particularly helpful where communication is by hand or rope signal – the hand and line signals are examples of standard procedures themselves – as the communicating parties have a better idea of what the other is likely to do in response. Where voice communication is available, standardised communications protocol reduces the time needed to convey necessary information and the error rate in transmission.\n\nDiving procedures generally involve the correct application of the appropriate diving skills in response to the current circumstances, and range from selecting and testing equipment to suit the diver and the dive plan, to the rescue of oneself or another diver in a life-threatening emergency. In many cases, what might be a life threatening emergency to an untrained or inadequately skilled diver, is a mere annoyance and minor distraction to a skilled diver who applies the correct procedure without hesitation. Professional diving operations tend to adhere more rigidly to standard operating procedures than recreational divers, who are not legally or contractually obliged to follow them, but the prevalence of diving accidents is known to be strongly correlated to human error, which is more common in divers with less training and experience. The Doing It Right philosophy of technical diving is strongly supportive of common standard procedures for all members of a dive team, and prescribe the procedures and equipment configuration which may affect procedures to the members of their organisations.\n\nThe terms \"diving skills\" and \"diving procedures\" are largely interchangeable, but a procedure may require the ordered application of several skills, and is a broader term. A procedure may also conditionally branch or require repeated applications of a skill, depending on circumstances. Diver training is structured around the learning and practice of standard procedures until the diver is assessed as competent to apply them reliably in reasonably foreseeable circumstances, and the certification issued limits the diver to environments and equipment that are compatible with their training and assessed skill levels. The teaching and assessment of diving skills and procedures is often restricted to registered instructors, who have been assessed as competent to teach and assess those skills by the certification or registration agency, who take the responsibility of declaring the diver competent against their assessment criteria. The teaching and assessment of other task oriented skills does not generally require a diving instructor.\n\nThere is considerable difference in the diving procedures of professional divers, where a diving team with formally appointed members in specific roles and with recognised competence is required by law, and recreational diving, where in most jurisdictions the diver is not constrained by specific laws, and in many cases is not required to provide any evidence of competence.\n\nUnderwater diver training is normally given by a qualified instructor who is a member of one of many diver training agencies or is registered with a government agency. Basic diver training entails the learning of skills required for the safe conduct of activities in an underwater environment, and includes procedures and skills for the use of diving equipment, safety, emergency self-help and rescue procedures, dive planning, and use of dive tables. Diving hand signals are used to communicate underwater. Professional divers will also learn other methods of communication.\n\nAn entry level diver must learn the techniques of breathing underwater through a demand regulator, including clearing it of water and recovering it if dislodged from the mouth, and clearing the mask if it is flooded. These are critical survival skills, and if not competent the diver is at a high risk of drowning. A related skill is sharing breathing gas with another diver, both as the donor and the recipient. This is usually done with a secondary demand valve carried for this purpose. Technical and professional divers will also learn how to use a backup gas supply carried in an independent scuba set, known as the emergency gas supply or bailout cylinder.\n\nTo avoid injury during descent, divers must be competent at equalising the ears, sinuses and mask; they must also learn not to hold their breath while ascending, to avoid barotrauma of the lungs. The speed of ascent must be controlled to avoid DCS, which requires buoyancy control skills. Good buoyancy control and trim also allow the diver to manoeuvre and move about safely, comfortably and efficiently, using swimfins for propulsion.\n\nSome knowledge of physiology and the physics of diving is considered necessary by most diver certification agencies, as the diving environment is alien and relatively hostile to humans. The physics and physiology knowledge required is fairly basic, and helps the diver to understand the effects of the diving environment so that informed acceptance of the associated risks is possible. The physics mostly relates to gases under pressure, buoyancy, heat loss, and light underwater. The physiology relates the physics to the effects on the human body, to provide a basic understanding of the causes and risks of barotrauma, DCS, gas toxicity, hypothermia, drowning and sensory variations. More advanced training often involves first aid and rescue skills, skills related to specialised diving equipment, and underwater work skills. Further training is required to develop the skills necessary for diving in a wider range of environments, with specialised equipment, and to become competent to perform a variety of underwater tasks.\n\nThe medical aspects of diving and hyperbaric exposure include examination of divers to establish medical fitness to dive, diagnosis and treatment of diving disorders, treatment by recompression and hyperbaric oxygen therapy, toxic effects of gases in a hyperbaric environment, and treatment of injuries incurred while diving which are not directly associated with depth or pressure.\n\nMedical fitness to dive is the medical and physical suitability of a diver to function safely in the underwater environment using underwater diving equipment and procedures. Depending on the circumstances it may be established by a signed statement by the diver that he or she does not suffer from any of the disqualifying conditions and is able to manage the ordinary physical requirements of diving, by a detailed medical examination by a physician registered as a medical examiner of divers following a prescribed procedural checklist, attested by a legal document of fitness to dive issued by the medical examiner and recorded on a national database, or by alternatives between these extremes.\n\nPsychological fitness to dive is not normally evaluated before recreational or commercial diver training, but can influence the safety and success of a diving career.\n\nDiving medicine is the diagnosis, treatment and prevention of conditions caused by exposing divers to the underwater environment. It includes the effects on the body of pressure on gases, the diagnosis and treatment of conditions caused by marine hazards and how fitness to dive affects a diver's safety. Hyperbaric medicine is another field associated with diving, since recompression in a hyperbaric chamber with hyperbaric oxygen therapy is the definitive treatment for two of the most important diving-related illnesses, DCS and arterial gas embolism.\n\nDiving medicine deals with medical research on issues of diving, the prevention of diving disorders, treatment of diving accident injuries and diving fitness. The field includes the effect on the human body of breathing gases and their contaminants under high pressure, and the relationship between the state of physical and psychological health of the diver and safety. In diving accidents it is common for multiple disorders to occur together and interact with each other, both causatively and as complications. Diving medicine is a branch of occupational medicine and sports medicine, and first aid and recognition of symptoms of diving disorders are important parts of diver education.\n\nRisk is a combination of hazard, vulnerability and likelihood of occurrence, which can be the probability of a specific undesirable consequence of a hazard, or the combined probability of undesirable consequences of all the hazards of an activity.\n\nThe presence of a combination of several hazards simultaneously is common in diving, and the effect is generally increased risk to the diver, particularly where the occurrence of an incident due to one hazard triggers other hazards with a resulting cascade of incidents. Many diving fatalities are the result of a cascade of incidents overwhelming the diver, who should be able to manage any single reasonably foreseeable incident.\n\nCommercial diving operations may expose the diver to more and sometimes greater hazards than recreational diving, but the associated occupational health and safety legislation is less tolerant of risk than recreational, particularly technical divers, may be prepared to accept. Commercial diving operations are also constrained by the physical realities of the operating environment, and expensive engineering solutions are often necessary to control risk. A formal hazard identification and risk assessment is a standard and required part of the planning for a commercial diving operation, and this is also the case for offshore diving operations. The occupation is inherently hazardous, and great effort and expense are routinely incurred to keep the risk within an acceptable range. The standard methods of reducing risk are followed where possible.\n\nStatistics on injuries related to commercial diving are normally collected by national regulators. In the UK the Health and Safety Executive (HSE) is responsible for the overview of about 5,000 commercial divers; in Norway the corresponding authority is the Petroleum Safety Authority Norway (PSA), which has maintained the DSYS database since 1985, gathering statistics on over 50,000 diver-hours of commercial activity per year. The risks of dying during recreational, scientific or commercial diving are small, and for scuba diving, deaths are usually associated with poor gas management, poor buoyancy control, equipment misuse, entrapment, rough water conditions and pre-existing health problems. Some fatalities are inevitable and caused by unforeseeable situations escalating out of control, but the majority of diving fatalities can be attributed to human error on the part of the victim. According to a North American 1972 analysis of calendar year 1970 data, diving was, based on man hours, 96 times more dangerous than driving a car. According to a 2000 Japanese study, every hour of recreational diving is 36 to 62 times riskier than driving.\n\nScuba diving fatalities have a major financial impact by way of lost income, lost business, insurance premium increases and high litigation costs. Equipment failure is rare in open circuit scuba, and when the cause of death is recorded as drowning, it is usually the consequence of an uncontrollable series of events in which drowning is the endpoint because it occurred in water, while the initial cause remains unknown. Air embolism is also frequently cited as a cause of death, often as a consequence of other factors leading to an uncontrolled and badly managed ascent, occasionally aggravated by medical conditions. About a quarter of diving fatalities are associated with cardiac events, mostly in older divers. There is a fairly large body of data on diving fatalities, but in many cases the data are poor due to the standard of investigation and reporting. This hinders research which could improve diver safety.\n\nArtisanal fishermen and gatherers of marine organisms in less developed countries may expose themselves to relatively high risk using diving equipment if they do not understand the physiological hazards, particularly if they use inadequate equipment.\n\nDivers operate in an environment for which the human body is not well suited. They face special physical and health risks when they go underwater or use high pressure breathing gas. The consequences of diving incidents range from merely annoying to rapidly fatal, and the result often depends on the equipment, skill, response and fitness of the diver and diving team. The hazards include the aquatic environment, the use of breathing equipment in an underwater environment, exposure to a pressurised environment and pressure changes, particularly pressure changes during descent and ascent, and breathing gases at high ambient pressure. Diving equipment other than breathing apparatus is usually reliable, but has been known to fail, and loss of buoyancy control or thermal protection can be a major burden which may lead to more serious problems. There are also hazards of the specific diving environment, and hazards related to access to and egress from the water, which vary from place to place, and may also vary with time. Hazards inherent in the diver include pre-existing physiological and psychological conditions and the personal behaviour and competence of the individual. For those pursuing other activities while diving, there are additional hazards of task loading, of the dive task and of special equipment associated with the task.\n\nThe major factors influencing diving safety are the environment, the diving equipment and the performance of the diver and the dive team. The underwater environment is alien, both physically and psychologically stressful, and usually not amenable to control, though divers can be selective in the conditions in which they are willing to dive. The other factors must be controlled to mitigate the overall stress on the diver and allow the dive to be completed in acceptable safety. The equipment is critical to diver safety for life support, but is generally reliable, controllable and predictable in its performance.\n\nHuman factors are the physical or cognitive properties of individuals, or social behaviour specific to humans, which influences functioning of technological systems as well as human-environment equilibrium. Human error is inevitable and everyone makes mistakes at some time, and the consequences of these errors are varied and depend on many factors. Most errors are minor and do not cause harm, but in a high risk environment, such as in diving, errors are more likely to have catastrophic consequences. Examples of human error leading to accidents are available in vast numbers, as it is the direct cause of 60% to 80% of all accidents. Human error and panic are considered to be the leading causes of diving accidents and fatalities. A study by William P. Morgan indicates that over half of all divers in the survey had experienced panic underwater at some time during their diving career, and these findings were independently corroborated by a survey that suggested 65% of recreational divers have panicked under water. Panic frequently leads to errors in a diver's judgement or performance, and may result in an accident. The safety of underwater diving operations can be improved by reducing the frequency of human error and the consequences when it does occur.\n\nOnly 4.46% of the recreational diving fatalities in a 1997 study were attributable to a single contributory cause. The remaining fatalities probably arose as a result of a progressive sequence of events involving two or more procedural errors or equipment failures, and since procedural errors are generally avoidable by a well-trained, intelligent and alert diver, working in an organised structure, and not under excessive stress, it was concluded that the low accident rate in professional scuba diving is due to this factor. The study also concluded that it would be impossible to completely eliminate all minor contraindications of scuba diving, as this would result in overwhelming bureaucracy and bring all diving to a halt.\n\nRisk management is obtained by the usual measures of engineering controls, administrative controls and procedures, and personal protective equipment, including hazard identification and risk assessment (HIRA), protective equipment, medical screening, training and standardised procedures. Professional divers are generally legally obliged to carry out and formally record these measures, and though recreational divers are not legally required to do many of them, competent recreational divers, and particularly technical divers, generally perform them informally but routinely, and they are an important part of technical diver training. For example, a medical statement or examination for fitness, pre-dive site assessment and briefing, safety drills, thermal protection, equipment redundancy, alternative air source, buddy checks, buddy or team diving procedures, dive planning, underwater hand signals, and carrying first aid and oxygen administration equipment are all routinely part of technical diving.\n\nInshore and inland commercial and military diving is regulated by legislation in many countries. Responsibility of the employer, client and diving personnel is specified in these cases; offshore commercial diving may take place in international waters, and is often done following the guidelines of a voluntary membership organisation such as the International Marine Contractors Association (IMCA), which publishes codes of accepted best practice which their member organisations are expected to follow.\n\nRecreational diver training and dive leading are industry regulated in some countries, and only directly regulated by government in a subset of them. In the UK, HSE legislation includes recreational diver training and dive leading for reward; in the US and South Africa industry regulation is accepted, though non-specific health and safety legislation still applies. In Israel recreational diving activities are regulated by the Recreational Diving Act, 1979.\n\nThe legal responsibility for recreational diving service providers is usually limited as far as possible by waivers which they require the customer to sign before engaging in any diving activity. The extent of responsibility of recreational buddy divers is unclear and has been the subject of considerable litigation. It is probable that it varies between jurisdictions. In spite of this lack of clarity, buddy diving is recommended by recreational diver training agencies as safer than solo diving, and some service providers insist that customers dive in buddy pairs.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1982061", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1982061", "title": "Will.i.am", "text": "Will.i.am\n\nWilliam James Adams Jr. (born March 15, 1975), known professionally as will.i.am (pronounced \"will I am\"), is an American rapper, singer, songwriter, DJ, record producer, actor and philanthropist. He is best known as a founding and lead member of the hip hop group The Black Eyed Peas, and has also released four solo albums beginning with \"Lost Change\" (2001, Atlantic Records). \n\nHis second solo album, \"Must B 21\", was released on September 23, 2003. The track \"Go!\", was regularly used as the theme for the \"NBA Live 2005\" and \"Madden NFL 2005\" seasons. The third album, \"Songs About Girls\", was released on September 25, 2007. He released his fourth studio album, \"#willpower\", in 2013.\n\nAs a music producer, will.i.am has produced with other artists including Michael Jackson, Justin Bieber, Kesha, Britney Spears, Miley Cyrus, David Guetta, U2, Rihanna, Cheryl, Lady Gaga, Usher, Justin Timberlake, A. R. Rahman, Nicki Minaj, 2NE1, and Baby Kaely. In collaborations and with the Black Eyed Peas, he has a total of 41 top-40 entries on the UK Singles Chart since 1998, and has sold 9.4 million singles in the UK.\n\nWilliam James Adams Jr. was born in Eastside Los Angeles, and was raised in the Estrada Courts housing projects in the Boyle Heights neighborhood, where he and his family were among the few African Americans living in a predominantly Hispanic community. Adams has never met his father, William Adams Sr. He was raised by his mother, Debra (née Cain), who encouraged him to be unique and to avoid conforming to the tendencies of the other youths in his neighborhood on the east side of Los Angeles. To encourage his musical career, she sent him to public schools in affluent West Los Angeles. While attending John Marshall High School, he became best friends with Allan Pineda (stage name apl.de.ap), who was also a future member of The Black Eyed Peas. While still in high school, Adams and Pineda performed in East L.A. clubs and were soon joined by three other entertainers to form the socially conscious rap group, Atban Klann. Atban Klann caught the eye of Compton rapper Eazy-E and was signed to his label, Ruthless Records in 1992.\n\nAdams used to attend raves while in high school. He later said his history with rave culture is why he chose a more electro sound for The Black Eyed Peas' albums \"The E.N.D.\" and \"The Beginning\". Despite the use of electro and house music elements, will.i.am prefers to separate the underground from pop. In an article with \"Los Angeles Times\", he mentions that secrecy over the whereabouts of raves is what made \"raving\" special, and different from the mainstream.\n\nIn the summer of 1988 will.i.am began his music career when, as an eighth-grader, he met up with fellow rapper Allan Pineda (apl.de.ap) and fellow student Dante Santiago. They began performing together around Los Angeles and were soon discovered by rapper/entrepreneur Eazy-E, who signed them to his label Ruthless Records in 1992. At the time, Will was known as \"Will 1X\". Atban Klann's first ever official track, \"Merry Muthafuckin' Xmas\", was included on Eazy-E's EP \"\". After this, the trio began recording an album, \"Grass Roots\", with the help of producers Mookie Mook and DJ Motiv8, but the album was never released due to Eazy-E's death in 1995. After Eazy's tragic death, they changed their name to Black Eyed Pods, and Will replaced Dante with Jaime Gomez, better known under his stage name of Taboo. In 1997, they once again changed their name, this time to The Black Eyed Peas, and began recording their first album, \"Behind the Front\", with the help of soul singer Kim Hill. They were soon signed to Interscope Records, and released their debut single, \"Joints & Jam\", in early 1998. The album was successful enough for the group's contract to be renewed, and in 2000, a second album, \"Bridging the Gap\", was released.\n\nFollowing the release of \"Bridging the Gap\", Will began recording his first solo release, \"Lost Change\", which was the official soundtrack to the film of the same name. Featuring collaborations with Medusa, Planet Asia and Terry Dexter, the album was a critical success.\n\nIn November 2001, work began on a third Black Eyed Peas album, \"Elephunk\". Development of the album began on November 2, 2001 and was released just under two years later in 2003. At the time of development, only will.i.am, apl.de.ap and Taboo were to feature on the album. During the production of \"Shut Up\" (the second single released from the album), they realized that a female vocal would work well with the song. Originally, Nicole Scherzinger (lead singer of The Pussycat Dolls) was approached to make a guest appearance on the record. She was forced to decline because she already was signed to a contract with Eden's Crush. Danté Santiago then introduced Fergie to will.i.am, who was impressed with her vocal talents. She immediately formed a bond with the band and became a permanent member of the Peas and her photo was printed onto the album cover. Nine out of the fourteen tracks were composed by lyricist Robbie Fisher, who has been working closely with the band since the beginning stages of the album. In the United States, \"Elephunk\" reached number 14 on the \"Billboard Top 200\" and is their first album to chart in the top 15. It gained even more commercial success in the UK Album Charts where it reached number 3. It has sold over 1.6 million copies in the UK and 8.5 million copies worldwide. The singles \"Where Is the Love?\" and \"Shut Up\" reached number 1. \"Hey Mama\" has been used for several advertisements including advertisements for Apple and iTunes. \"Let's Get It Started\" also received universal acclaim in the media section where a cover version of the song appears in the film \"Hot Tub Time Machine\". After the success of \"Elephunk\", the Peas were approached by EA games to feature some of their music on the 2004 game \"\". They remixed some of the tracks on Elephunk and translated it into Simlish and created new tracks for the game. They also feature in the game as playable characters.\n\nThe group released their breakthrough single, \"Where Is The Love\", in November 2002 (featuring Justin Timberlake, although he did not appear in the video). On the strength of that single and follow-up singles like \"Shut Up\", \"Elephunk\" went on to sell 8.5 million copies worldwide. During this time, Will recorded a second solo album, \"Must B 21\". In 2002, Will recorded the song \"Secrets\" for the soundtrack to \"\", a musical accompaniment to the Cartoon Network original series. Prior to this, he had also composed the theme music for another Genndy Tartakovsky series, \"Samurai Jack\".\n\nIn November 2003, work began on a fourth Black Eyed Peas album, entitled \"Monkey Business\", the second album with new band member Fergie. Upon the success of \"Monkey Business\", which was released in 2005, the album was certified three times Platinum by the RIAA in the U.S. and has sold over 10 million copies worldwide. The Canadian Recording Industry Association (or CRIA) has certified \"Monkey Business\" 6x Platinum, with sales of over 600,000 copies. The Australian Recording Industry Association (or ARIA) has also certified \"Monkey Business\" 6x Platinum, denoting sales of over 420,000 copies. The album's tracks earned the group four 2006 Grammy Award nominations and they also won the Grammy for Best Rap Performance by a Duo or Group for \"Don't Phunk with My Heart\". According to IFPI, over 2 million copies have been sold in Europe. In the UK alone, it has sold over 1 million copies, although this is significantly lower than their sales of \"Elephunk\", which stand at over 1.6 million copies and 10 million worldwide.\nthe band announced they were going to take a break to focus on their own personal projects. Will went on to produce Ferguson's first solo album, \"The Dutchess\", which was released in 2006, before beginning work with Michael Jackson, who had requested Will's expertise for the recording and production of his new album. Work began on the Jackson album in 2006, and continued until the singer's death in 2009, at which point will.i.am revealed that none of the material recorded during the period would be released. However, remixes recorded for Jackson's \"Thriller 25\" anniversary album were released in 2008.\n\nIn 2007, will.i.am announced that he had co-created an all-female soul band entitled the Paradiso Girls, who he intended to work with on an upcoming solo project. The album, \"Songs About Girls\", was released in 2007. The album spawned three singles, \"I Got It From My Mama\", \"One More Chance\" and \"Heartbreaker\", and fared slightly better than his previous solo efforts, however, failed to shift more than 75,000 copies. Will also did a remix to the song With Love by actress and singer Hilary Duff.\n\nIn 2008, will.i.am contributed the song \"One Tribe\" to the Survival International charity album, \"Songs for Survival\". Also in 2008, he was featured on rapper Flo Rida's debut album, \"Mail on Sunday\", where he produced and featured on the song \"In the Ayer\", and featured on Usher's fifth album, \"Here I Stand\". In January 2008, will.i.am announced plans that he was masterminding a political album, \"\", in support of Barack Obama's presidential campaign. The first single, \"Yes We Can\", featured a music video directed by Jesse Dylan. The lyrics of the song are composed almost entirely of excerpts from Obama's speech on January 8, 2008, following the New Hampshire presidential primary election. The video features appearances from numerous celebrities including Scarlett Johansson, Tatyana Ali, John Legend, Herbie Hancock, Kate Walsh, Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, Adam Rodríguez, Kelly Hu, Hill Harper, Amber Valletta, Eric Balfour, Aisha Tyler, Nicole Scherzinger, Nick Cannon, Bryan Greenberg, and Common and first appeared on the website for Dipdive. The video racked up three million views within a week and over four million subsequently on YouTube. On June 13, 2008, \"Yes We Can\" won an award at the 35th Annual Creative Arts and Entertainment Daytime Emmy Awards for \"New Approaches in Daytime Entertainment\". On February 29, 2008, the album's second single, \"We Are the Ones\", was released on Dipdive and YouTube. Including cameo appearances from Jessica Alba, Ryan Phillippe, Kerry Washington, pop punk band Yellowcard's front man, Ryan Key, John Leguizamo, Regina King, Tyrese Gibson, Eric Mabius, Tichina Arnold, Adrianne Palicki, comedian George Lopez, and singers Macy Gray, Zoe Kravitz and The Black Eyed Peas' Taboo, the video features everyone chanting \"O-BA-MA\" as a portrayal as their hopes and wishes for Barack Obama and his presidential campaign. On November 4, 2008, will.i.am spoke to CNN's Anderson Cooper about his support for then-Senator Obama using CNN's 'hologram' technology (actually tomography). Following the 2008 election, and Obama's victory, Will released the album's third single, \"It's a New Day\". The video reflects on the historical events that led to the election of the first African-American president and the public's reaction to his election. The video features celebrities such as Fergie, Olivia Wilde, Kanye West, Harold Perrineau, Kevin Bacon, and his wife Kyra Sedgwick. The video debuted on \"The Oprah Winfrey Show\". In honor of the inauguration of Barack Obama as president, will.i.am collaborated with producer David Foster on the album's fourth single, \"America's Song\", with contributing vocals from Seal, Bono, Mary J. Blige, and Faith Hill. In response to Barack Obama's reaction following Kanye West's interruption of Taylor Swift at the 2009 MTV Video Music Awards, will.i.am penned the album's fifth and final single, \"The Jackass Song\". It featured a sample of Kanye West's \"Heartless\". Will wrote a blog post, which featured the song on Dipdive, and released in February 2009. will.i.am attended and spoke at the FIRST Robotics Competition kickoff on January 8, 2011, declaring, \"I am a FIRST fan.\" He has also named FIRST Founder Dean Kamen \"one of [his] heroes\" on his verified Twitter account.\n\nIn March 2009, will.i.am announced plans for The Black Eyed Peas to return, and within months, their comeback single, \"Boom Boom Pow\", had reached number 1 on the UK Singles Chart and \"Billboard\" Hot 100. They went on to have three number 1 singles before releasing their comeback album, \"The E.N.D\". The album's success warranted a second comeback album, \"The Beginning\", released in November 2010. The album spawned another three hit singles, but the band soon announced plans they were to break again, following the conclusion of their world tour. In 2009, will.i.am worked with rappers Flo Rida and Akon for Flo's second studio album, \"R.O.O.T.S.\", and recorded four tracks with Girls Aloud member Cheryl for her debut solo album \"3 Words\". He also worked with Rihanna on her fourth studio album, \"Rated R\", for a track called \"Photographs\". In February 2010, he wrote and produced the single \"OMG\" by Usher, which appeared on Usher's seventh studio album, \"Raymond vs. Raymond\". In a YouTube video posted by YGLifeOfficial on March 15, 2010, will.i.am expressed his desire to work with Korean K-pop girl group 2NE1, and help them achieve international success. Will has recorded a collaboration with Britney Spears, \"Big Fat Bass\", which features on her seventh studio album, \"Femme Fatale\".\n\nDuring the recording of The Black Eyed Peas' sixth studio album, \"The Beginning\", band colleague Fergie announced in an interview that will.i.am was in the process of recording a new solo album, tentatively entitled \"Black Einstein\". will.i.am formally announced that he was in the process of recording a fourth solo album, with some material being recorded under the pseudonym Zuper Blahq. In January 2010, a cut from the album, \"I'm In the House\", a collaboration with Steve Aoki, was released as a single, charting at #29 on the UK Singles Chart due to strong downloads. In October 2010, a second cut from the album, \"Check It Out\", a collaboration with Trinidadian rapper Nicki Minaj, peaked at #4 on the UK Singles Chart. In February 2011, a third cut from the album, \"Dance\", a collaboration with Natalia Kills, peaked at #62 on the UK Singles Chart. The music video was directed by James Sutton, and features a cameo by Natalia. In April 2011, will.i.am recorded four songs for the soundtrack of the animated film \"Rio\", in which he voiced a character. \"Hot Wings (I Wanna Party)\", \"Drop It Low\", \"Real In Rio\" and \"Advice For The Young At Heart\", featuring an array of artists including Jamie Foxx, Anne Hathaway and Tears for Fears. None of the songs managed to chart, however, Will announced that he was going to remix the tracks for inclusion on \"Black Einstein\". In September 2011, a fourth cut from the album, \"Forever\", a collaboration with Wolfgang Gartner, was released as a single. It was around this time that will.i.am announced that he changed the title of the album from \"Black Einstein\" to \"#willpower\". The video premiered on August 26, 2011. In November 2011, Will premiered what is intended to be the album's official lead single, \"T.H.E. (The Hardest Ever)\", a collaboration with Jennifer Lopez and Mick Jagger. Will announced via his Twitter that the video for \"T.H.E. (The Hardest Ever)\" was filmed in LA, and that before he returned home, he stopped off in Brazil to film the video for the album's second official single, \"Great Times\". In December 2011, a fifth cut from the album, \"Party Like An Animal\", a collaboration with Dutch singer Eva Simons & LMFAO, premiered at the HTC Beats Launch party. Will.i.am also announced he has collaborations with Britney Spears, Alicia Keys, Busta Rhymes, Swizz Beatz and a couple others on the album. He also stated there is a possibility Shakira could feature on the album. \"#willpower\" is due for release in 2013, and will.i.am later confirmed that Cheryl and Justin Bieber would also appear on \"#willpower\". In mid-October, Britney Spears confirmed on her Twitter account that she had filmed the music video for the single she was featuring in called \"Scream & Shout\".\n\nHe was among the performers at the Diamond Jubilee Concert held outside Buckingham Palace on June 4, 2012.\n\nThe first song broadcast from Mars was his new single, \"Reach for the Stars\". He discussed and listened to it with a live audience at NASA in Pasadena, California after it was returned from the \"Curiosity\" rover.\n\nThe song \"Hall of Fame\" by The Script also featured will.i.am. It debuted onto radio on July 23, 2012 and was released for digital download on August 21, 2012. He later featured in Priyanka Chopra's debut single \"In My City\". It was announced in October 2012 that will.i.am will feature on Kesha's second album \"Warrior\" on the track \"Crazy Kids\". He also co-wrote and co-produced the Dr Luke produced track.\n\nIn November 2012, will.i.am released the third single from \"#willpower\" which was \"Scream & Shout\" featuring Britney Spears. It debuted in the top 20 on the Billboard 100, eventually reaching a peak of number 3 and debuting at number 2 on the UK Singles Chart and reaching number one in January 2013 for two weeks. It went number one in many countries \n\nDuring an interview with Capital FM, will.i.am confirmed he had collaborated with Justin Bieber for his next release \"#thatPOWER\" and premiered the single on the same day it was released onto iTunes in the US the same day and debuted on the Billboard 100 at number 42.\n\nIn April 2013, will.i.am and Chris Brown's track \"Let's Go\", also from the #willpower album, became the centre of a copyright controversy, with trance producers Arty and Mat Zo claiming that will.i.am used elements of their 2011 track \"Rebound\" in his song without permission from the artists or their label. This claim was later backed by Anjunabeats, the record label behind Arty and Mat Zo.\n\nHis fourth studio album, \"#willpower\", was re-released in December 2013 featuring several new tracks, including the lead single \"Feelin' Myself\" featuring Miley Cyrus, French Montana, and Wiz Khalifa.\n\nBritney Spears featured will.i.am on her song \"It Should Be Easy\" on her eighth studio album \"Britney Jean\" where he co-wrote and produced several tracks. He was also a executive producer of the project.\n\nOn April 4, 2014, will.i.am appeared on \"\", where he talked about plans to release his own Smartwatch. He revealed that it can be used as a phone, to store music, and use Facebook, Twitter and Instagram. He also showed a preview of a music video for a song called \"It's My Birthday\". On May 20, 2014, a 90-second snippet was uploaded to SoundCloud. It features American singer-songwriter Cody Wise, is produced by Will and Damien LeRoy and is written by himself, Cody Wise and Keith Harris. It was released on July 6, 2014.\n\nIn an interview with Capital FM, will.i.am confirmed that The Black Eyed Peas were getting back together. On April 7, 2016 will.i.am released the single \"Boys & Girls\" featuring Pia Mia. A week later on April 14, a new remix of \"Mona Lisa Smile\" featuring Nicole Scherzinger was released.\n\nThe Black Eyed Peas, including will.i.am, first started acting in the commercial series \"Instant Def\" to advertise Snickers. He starred in \"\" as the voice of the character \"Moto Moto\". He contributed a number of tracks to the movie's motion picture soundtrack in collaboration with industry heavyweight Hans Zimmer. Will.i.am played John Wraith in his major film debut, \"\", a prequel to the \"X-Men\" film series. He also guest starred on the CBS drama \"Joan of Arcadia\" as God, one of several actors who played this role during the series. He also starred in the 2011 animated film \"Rio\", and 2014's \"Rio 2\", as a rapping red-crested cardinal named Pedro, and like \"Madagascar: Escape 2 Africa\", he contributed his singing voice to the film's soundtrack, along with his fellow co-stars. Will.i.am played a fathering role in \"\", which uses The Black Eyed Peas' songs as its own soundtrack. He briefly played himself in the Tina Fey and Steve Carell comedy film \"Date Night\". He appeared in the 2016 Grammy-nominated documentary film about American DJ and producer Steve Aoki, titled \"I'll Sleep When I'm Dead\".\n\nOn October 25, 2011, it was reported that will.i.am would be joining \"The Voice UK\" as a coach. A source said, \"Will is 95 per cent a done deal. He is a big star and loves nurturing new talent. He shoots from the lip, and will not be afraid to tell it like it is. Although, I doubt The Voice will be as bitchy as The X Factor\". will.i.am was later confirmed as a coach on \"The Voice UK\", of this he said, \"I'm proud to be doing The Voice UK because the UK was the first place I saw success,\" he said. \"It's the place I'm the most creative outside of home.\" Cohen added, \"I am thrilled that will.i.am has signed up to be a coach on The Voice. He is a huge star who will bring a unique creativity to the show.\" Talking about the differences between the show and \"X Factor\", \"I won’t be a judge on X Factor. The Voice is different. You can’t even compare the two. One, you have people in the music industry, current and legends, coaching the next generation. The other format you have judges critiquing, giving their opinions on things when they don’t really know, other than Randy Jackson on Idol\".\n\nIn preparation for the role as a coach, he asked advice from friend and ex-\"The X Factor\" judge Cheryl Cole. Talking to \"Capital FM\" he said, \"I reached out to Cheryl for advice on keeping your cool, having a poker face, the importance of sticking with the singers – it's their dream, a lot of the times when you have other performers a part of the show, celebrities tend to want the shine so they hog up time. So my whole thing was that I want to do The Voice, but I don't want to hog up time to where the singers up there are looking like, 'Is this about you guys?'. In March 2012, it was reported that he had turned his \"plush\" dressing room into a recording studio, and \"instead of just listening with his headphones, he has installed some mega bass bins\".\n\nOn November 26, 2013, will.i.am was announced as a coach for the 2014 series of the Australian version of \"The Voice\" along with fellow \"Voice UK\" judge Kylie Minogue. He was the winning coach having coached voice winner Anja Nissen in 2014. Neither will.i.am nor Minogue returned for the fourth series in 2015.\n\nHe has contributed to \"The Voice UK\" since 2012. He also serves as a coach on the UK version of \"The Voice Kids\".\n\nBefore joining The Black Eyed Peas, will.i.am attended the Fashion Institute of Design & Merchandising in Los Angeles. In 2001, he began designing his own signature clothing line, \"i.am\", which made its official debut in 2005 at the Magic Apparel Trade Show in Las Vegas. In 2007, will.i.am teamed up with Blue Holdings to design a premium denim collection, \"i.am Antik\", that was scheduled to debut in August 2007 at the Project Show in Las Vegas. will.i.am instead had new partners and was launching \"i.am\". Will.i.am is currently being sued $2 million for abandoning the project for which, the label states, he was obligated until 2016, but will.i.am insists it is already over. He also launched his own glasses range.\n\nAppearing at the kickoff event for the 2011 FIRST Robotics Competition, Logo Motion held at Southern New Hampshire University, will.i.am stated that he is \"a big fan\", and that the newly unveiled game was \"dope\".
