A group of Croatian students used the visit to protest the rule of the Hungarian Károly Khuen-Héderváry as Croatian ban. They were led by Stjepan Radić, who would later form the influential Croatian People's Peasant Party.\n\nThe emperor arrived in Zagreb by train on October 14, 1895. Upon his arrival a group of students chanted \"Slava Jelačiću\" (\"Glory to Jelačić\"), in reference to the former Croatian ban Josip Jelačić who had risen up against the Hungarians in the Revolutions of 1848. That day the emperor attended the unveiling ceremonial completion of the Croatian National Theatre. Music by Ivan Zajc was subsequently performed inside the theatre. \n\nThe following day, the emperor attended an honorary dance at the \"Kolo\" building. On this day a group of students led by Stjepan Radić planned a burning of the Hungarian tricolour. \n\nOn October 16, the final day of the imperial visit, the students marched to Ban Jelačić Square where they chanted \"Živio hrvatski kralj Franjo Josip I\" (\"Long live Croatian king Franz Joseph I\"), \"Slava Jelačiću\" and \"Abzug Magjari\" (\"Away with Hungarians\"). They doused the Hungarian tricolour in brandy and set it on fire. They then marched towards the University of Zagreb. The city police soon informed ban Khuen-Héderváry of the act and the students were arrested.\n\nThe students were subsequently charged for the incident. Stjepan Radić was sentenced to six months in jail, Gjuro Balaško to five, and Milan Dorwald, Osman Hadžić, Vladimir Vidrić, Josip Šikutrić, Vladimir Frank and Ivan Fran to four months. The students were all barred from the University of Zagreb while Stjepan Radić was barred from all universities in the empire. This led him to continue his studies abroad in Paris. The other students went to the Charles University in Prague and the University of Vienna. \n\nThese students would form the basis of the Croatian Moderna, a cultural and political movement active at the turn of the century, characterized by anti-traditionalism, cosmopolitanism, and focus on artistic freedom. In 1897, the Prague group of students began publishing \"Hrvatska misao\", while in 1898 the Vienna students began publishing \"Mladost\".\n\nThe flag burning also resulted in a split between the Croatian Party of Rights and the Croatian Pure Party of Rights who disagreed on the flag-burning.\n\n\n"}

Weisgan wanted to disrupt the Israeli Government's unilateral disengagement plan in Gaza by sparking a Palestinian reaction. On 27 September 2006, Weisgan was sentenced by the Israeli court to four consecutive terms of life in prison, for each person he killed, and an additional twelve years in jail. Later that year, he committed suicide by hanging himself in prison.\n\nWeisgan, who lived in the Israeli settlement of Shvut Rachel, had known two of his targets, Bassam and Usama Tawafsha from the neighbouring Palestinian hillside village of Sanjal, for eight years. The shooting rampage, executed with premeditation and in cold blood, according to the court, occurred while he was giving both them and another victim a lift home from work. He stole a security guard's gun and opened fire, shooting four Palestinians several times, and then reloading to seek out and shoot a fifth victim at his work-place. After the killing spree he either turned himself in to, or was overpowered by, security guards at the settlement. He killed four Palestinians: Khalil Muhammad Ra'uf Saleh Wleiwel, Ahmad 'Ali Hassan Mansur, Bassam Mussa Ahmad 'Odeh Tawafshah, and Osama Mussa Ahmad 'Odeh Tawafshah. A fifth was wounded.\n\nIn the aftermath, Usama's wife Aisha called for revenge against Israel, the settlers and the then Israeli Prime Minister Ariel Sharon, saying,When one of them kills us they say he is crazy, but if an Arab does that to a settler the whole world is up in arms saying he's a terrorist. They had worked with him (Weisgan) for eight years. They used to say how decent he was, how they used to eat together, how he used to ask them for our food to take to his wife.\n\nWeisgan worked as a bus-driver, transporting Palestinian labourers to the Shvut Rachel settlement's aluminum factory, where the victims were employed. The \"Haaretz\" newspaper quoted Weisgan having declared, before entering a courthouse outside of Tel Aviv, 'I'm not sorry for what I did. I hope someone also kills Sharon.'\n\nWeisgan was tried in the Jerusalem District Court, and convicted on 11 September 2006. On 27 September 2006, Weisgan was sentenced four consecutive terms of life in prison for each person he killed, an additional 12 years in prison for injuring another Palestinian, and was ordered to pay NIS 220,000 in damages to the families of each murder victim and an additional NIS 100,000 to the wounded victim. The judges ruled: Every one of the victims had a name and an identity... They were the immediate victims of the convicted man's actions and he must be punished for the murders of each and every one of them. It was a savage murder of innocents, who fell victim to the twisted logic of the accused.\n\nOn December 22, 2006, Weisgan committed suicide by hanging himself in prison.\n"}

He has developed with Alfonso Rueda a speculative theory that the non-zero lowest energy state of the vacuum, as predicted by quantum mechanics, might provide a physical explanation for the origin of inertia, and might someday be used for spacecraft propulsion. Haisch has advocated the serious scientific study of phenomena outside the traditional scope of science and is known for his interest in the UFO phenomenon as well as a variety of other unorthodox topics.\n\nSince 2002 Haisch has been involved with ManyOne Networks and related Digital Universe projects which aim to produce, among other things, a multimedia online encyclopedia. In 2006 Haisch published a popular book in which he attempted to reconcile modern scientific belief with traditional religious belief. He attributes his spiritual interests to his educational experience at the Latin School of Indianapolis (a high school affiliated with the Roman Catholic Church), and at the St. Meinrad Seminary and Archabbey.\n\nHaisch was born in Stuttgart, Germany and earned a Ph.D. in Astronomy from the University of Wisconsin–Madison in 1975 and thereafter spent three years as a postdoctoral fellow at the Joint Institute for Laboratory Astrophysics at the University of Colorado in Boulder, Colorado.\n\nHaisch has worked at the Solar & Astrophysics Laboratory at Lockheed Martin in Palo Alto, California and served as deputy director of the Center for Extreme Ultraviolet Astrophysics Laboratory at the University of California, Berkeley. He has been a visiting scientist at the Max Planck Institute for Extraterrestrial Physics in Garching, Germany and at the University of Utrecht in the Netherlands. His main research from the mid 1970s until the late 1990s was high energy astrophysics, and specifically the ultraviolet and X-ray emissions from coronae and flares on the Sun and other late-type stars.\n\nHaisch has published more than one hundred research papers on a variety of topics, many in prestigious journals such as \"Nature\", \"Science\", \"Physical Review\", \"Astrophysical Journal\", and \"Annalen der Physik\". He also served for ten years as an editor of the \"Astrophysical Journal\".\n\nIn an extensive series of papers, Haisch and Alfonso Rueda, a physicist currently teaching in the Department of Electrical Engineering, California State University, Long Beach, California, have developed a controversial hypothesis in the context of stochastic electrodynamics. In his recent mainstream non-academic book (see section below), Haisch has summarized this \"quantum vacuum inertia\" hypothesis as follows:\nThis assertion, that accelerated observers experience a force due to the zero-point field, and that this \"electromagnetic reaction force\" is responsible for the inertia of material objects, rests upon a computation in which Haisch and Rueda have computed a nonzero \"zero point field Poynting vector\". (See the 1998 \"Foundations of Physics\" paper cited below.)\n\nComputations by other physicists, such as Bill Unruh, apparently contradict this result. The mainstream view is that the zero point field does not give rise to a physical force on observers accelerating with respect to \"the vacuum\". However, it is known classically that without the zero point field the spin state of all matter would collapse inward almost instantaneously.\n\nHaisch is a former editor of the Journal of Scientific Exploration, which publishes papers on \"topics outside the established disciplines of mainstream science\" such as paranormal effects, the UFO phenomenon, and cryptids.\n\nIn addition to papers in mainstream journals and conference proceedings, Haisch has also published papers in \"Science & Spirit\" magazine and the \"Journal of Noetic Sciences\", a parapsychological journal published by the Institute of Noetic Sciences.\n\nIn 1999 Haisch founded the California Institute for Physics and Astrophysics in Palo Alto, California, an organization mainly devoted to the study of the electromagnetic quantum vacuum and funded by private philanthropic money. The institute formerly employed five full-time physicists doing research on string theory, general relativity and stochastic electrodynamics. Haisch served as the institute's director from 1999 until 2002.\n\nHaisch has also created a website called UFO Skeptic, which promotes the investigation of the UFO phenomenon by professional scientists.\n\nIn 2006, Haisch published a book entitled \"The God Theory\", in which he writes\nHaisch published a follow-up in 2010, 'Purpose Guided Universe'. Both books reject both atheism and traditional theistic viewpoints, favoring instead a model of Pandeism wherein our Creator has become our Universe, to share in the actualized experiences therein manifested.

Since 2004 he also served as president of the now defunct Digital Universe Foundation, which, among other things, aimed to create a peer-reviewed alternative to English Wikipedia, seeking to provide a comprehensive and reliable account of current mainstream scientific theory, evidence, and belief.\n\n\nSelected mainstream papers by Bernard Haisch on astrophysics:\n\nA few representative publications regarding the proposed physical origin of inertia as an electromagnetic drag force and hypothetical spacecraft propulsion schemes:\n\n"}

He was a native Athenian, who traveled with Dion to Sicily to capture Syracuse, where Dion became the tyrant. Callippus then gained power by assassinating Dion, but ruled briefly before being ousted from power himself. Afterwards he commanded a band of mercenaries, who later killed him with the same sword that he used to kill Dion.\n\nCallippus was an Athenian who became a student of Plato. As the future tyrant of Syracuse, Dion, who was also a student of Plato, recruited Callippus as a member of his army which successfully invaded Syracuse. The army marched into Syracuse with 800 mercenaries and took control of the city, disposing of the previous tyrant, Dion’s nephew Dionysius II.\n\nIn exile, Dionysius bribed Callippus to kill Dion, and Callippus accepted the offer. He was in a prime position to assassinate Dion, since most of Dion’s closest friends had been killed by Dionysius the Younger, and Callippus was his closest friend remaining.\n\nCallippus used the money from Dionysius to bribe some of Dion’s troops to defect to him. He then won Dion’s trust by betraying some of the soldiers to Dion, who then enlisted Callippus’s as a secret agent to discover further plotters. In addition, whenever men told Dion that Callippus was maligning him, Dion simply thought that Callippus was acting as a spy.\n\nShortly afterwards, Dion’s only son fell from a window and died. Callippus spread a rumor saying that Dion had invited Dionysius’s son, Apollocrates to come to Syracuse as Dion’s successor. Dion’s wife, Arete, and sister, Aristomache, discovered the Callippus’s plot against Dion, but Dion was still paralyzed with remorse from his son’s death, and refused to take action.\n\nArete and Aristomache further inquired about the plot against Dion, and when Callippus discovered their inquisitiveness, he approached them and told them that he was loyal, and that he would prove his loyalty. They told him to take the Great Oath, involving a ceremony in Persephone’s temple, which he took. Following the ceremony, Callippus broke his vow and stabbed Dion to death, whereupon Callippus took control of Syracuse.\n\nFollowing Dion’s assassination, Callippus sent a message to Athens bragging of his deeds, but despite his bluster, Callippus’s hold on Syracuse was tenuous. Friends of Dion attempted a revolt against him, but were unsuccessful. Callippus also had Arete and Aristomache thrown in prison, where Arete gave birth to Dion’s son. But due to his rising unpopularity, Callippus did not have Dion's son killed, despite the danger he posed.\n\nSeveral different accounts are given of how Callippus fell from power in Syracuse. According to Diodorus Siculus, Hipparinus, a son of Dionysius the Elder, a previous tyrant of Syracuse, attacked Syracuse with a fleet and army, after which Callippus fled from the city. According to Polyaenus, Hipparinus was staying in Leontini when Callippus had sent out his army. Hipparinus attacked while most of the army was gone and secured control of the city.\n\nAccording to Plutarch, Callippus does lose control of the city while he is absent, on an expedition to conquer Catana. But in Plutarch’s version Hipparinus is not mentioned, and instead Syracuse revolted against Callippus.\n\nCallippus then attempted to conquer Messina instead, but his army was defeated. With his remaining troops he wandered around Sicily, but finding himself unable to support himself he traveled to Italy. There he conquered Rhegium, which had previously been controlled by Dionysius the Younger. But because he mistreated his mercenaries, his comrades Leptines II and Polyperchon stabbed him to death with a sword, reputed to be the same sword that killed Dion.\n\n|width=25% align=center|Preceded by:<br>Dion\n"}

His best-known work today is the semi-autobiographical \"America Is in the Heart\", but he first gained fame for his 1943 essay on \"The Freedom from Want\".\n\nBulosan was born to Ilocano parents in the Philippines in Binalonan, Pangasinan. There is considerable debate around his actual birth date, as he himself used several dates, but 1911 is generally considered the most reliable answer, based on his baptismal records, but according to the late Lorenzo Duyanen Sampayan, his childhood playmate and nephew, Carlos was born on November 2, 1913. Most of his youth was spent in the countryside as a farmer. It is during his youth that he and his family were economically impoverished by the rich and political elite, which would become one of the main themes of his writing. His home town is also the starting point of his famous semi-autobiographical novel, \"America is in the Heart\".\n\nFollowing the pattern of many Filipinos during the American colonial period, he left for America on July 22, 1930 at age 17, in the hope of finding salvation from the economic depression of his home. He never again saw his Philippine homeland. Upon arriving in Seattle, he met with racism and was forced to work in low paying jobs. He worked as a farmworker, harvesting grapes and asparagus, and doing other types of hard work in the fields of California. He also worked as a dishwasher with his brother and Lorenzo in the famous Madonna Inn in San Luis Obispo.\n\nBulosan was active in labour movement along the Pacific coast of the United States and edited the 1952 Yearbook for International Longshore and Warehouse Union Local 37, a predominantly Filipino American cannery trade union based in Seattle.\n\nThere is some controversy surrounding the accuracy of events recorded within \"America Is in the Heart\". He is celebrated for giving a post-colonial, Asian immigrant perspective to the labor movement in America and for telling the experience of Filipinos working in the U.S. during the 1930s and '40s. In the 1970s, with a resurgence in Asian/Pacific Islander American activism, his unpublished writings were discovered in a library in the University of Washington leading to posthumous releases of several unfinished works and anthologies of his poetry.\n\nHis other novels include \"The Laughter of My Father\", which were originally published as short sketches, and the posthumously published \"The Cry and the Dedication\" which detailed the Hukbalahap Rebellion in the Philippines.\n\nOne of his most famous essays, published in March 1943, was chosen by \"The Saturday Evening Post\" to accompany its publication of the Norman Rockwell painting \"Freedom from Want,\" part of a series based on Franklin D. Roosevelt's \"Four Freedoms\" speech. Maxim Lieber was his literary agent in 1944.\n\nAs a labor organizer and socialist writer, he was blacklisted. Denied a means to provide for himself, his later years were of flight and hardship, probably including alcoholism. He died in Seattle suffering from an advanced stage of bronchopneumonia. He is buried at Mount Pleasant Cemetery on Queen Anne Hill in Seattle.\n\nBulosan's works and legacy is heralded in a permanent exhibition, \"The Carlos Bulosan Memorial Exhibit,\" at the Eastern Hotel in Seattle's International District.

Clarke (born Washington DC, May 16, 1947) is a lesbian poet, essayist, educator and a Black feminist community activist: she lives in Jersey City, New Jersey, and Hobart, New York. With her life partner, Barbara Balliet, she is co-owner of Bleinheim Hill Books, a used and rare bookstore in Hobart. Her younger sister is novelist Breena Clarke, with whom Clarke and Balliet organize the Hobart Festival of Women writers each summer. Her scholarship focuses on African-American women's literature, black lesbian feminism, and the Black Arts Movement in the United States. Retired from her work in higher education, she maintains a teaching affiliation with the Graduate Faculty of the Department of Women and Gender Studies, Rutgers, the State University of New Jersey, and serves on the board of the Newark Pride Alliance.\n\nThe daughter of James Sheridan Clarke (September 18, 1912 – January 18, 2009), a veteran of World War II, and Edna Clarke, Cheryl was born and raised in Washington, D.C. at the height of the American civil rights movement, one of four sisters and a brother. The family was Catholic, descended from freed slaves who had emigrated to the nation's capitol after the Civil War. Both parents were civil servants and registered Democrats: James Clarke worked for the National Bureau of Standards for 33 years, and was considered to be the \"mayor\" of their neighborhood in the NW section of Washington. Experiencing Jim Crow segregation first hand in Washington for much of their lives, James and Edna raised their children with a strong sense of social justice and a belief in the importance of political activism.\n\nWhen she was 13, Clarke crossed a picket line of African-American activists protesting segregation at Woolworth's on 14th Street, believing that this was a rebellious act. However,when she came home her mother, a staunch union member, told her never to cross a picket line again, educating her about the role of direct action politics in the civil rights movement. At 16, Clarke was allowed by her parents to attend the 1963 March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom with them, despite their concerns that there might be violence. The day before the march, on the way downtown to acquire information about the route, she ran into Martin Luther King, Jr.\n\nClarke attended parochial schools in the District of Columbia, and matriculated at Howard University in 1965. She received a B.A. in English literature in 1969. Subsequently, she enrolled at Rutgers University, completing a master's degree in 1974, an MSW in 1980, and a Ph.D in 2000. For much of this time, she also worked for Rutgers, beginning her employment there in 1970 as an administrator in student services. At Rutgers, Carke was a pioneer in co-curricular programming that made the university more accessible to students of color and LGBT students. In 1992, she was the founding Director of Diverse Community Affairs and Lesbian/Gay Concerns, which became the Office for Social Justice Education and LGBT Communities in 2004. She served as the Dean of Students of the Livingston Campus at Rutgers University from 2009 to 2013. After 41 years in higher education, Clarke retired from Rutgers in 2013.\n\nClarke is the author of four collections of poetry: \"Narratives: Poems in the Tradition of Black Women\" (originally self-published in 1981 and distributed by in 1982); and for Firebrand Books \"Living as a Lesbian\" (1986), \"Humid Pitch\" (1989) and \"Experimental Love\" (1993).\n\nShe also published \"After Mecca — Women Poets and the Black Arts Movement\" (Rutgers University Press, 2005), the first study of its kind that made more visible the contributions of black women to a field that traditionally recognized black men, and \"Days of Good Looks: Prose and Poetry, 1980–2005\" (Carroll & Graf Publishing, 2006), a collection that represented 25 years of published writing.\n\nClarke has served on the editorial collective of \"Conditions\", an early lesbian publication, and has been published in numerous anthologies, journals, magazines, and newspapers, including \"Conditions 5, The Black Women's Issue\" (1979), \"\" (1982), \"\" (1984), \"The Black Scholar\", \"The Kenyon Review\", \"Feminist Review of Books\", \"Belles Lettres\", \"The Gay Community News\". Clarke's iconic articles, \"Lesbianism: an act of resistance\" and \"The Failure to Transform: Homophobia in the Black Community\", published in \"This Bridge\" and \"Home Girls\", respectively, are often included in women studies, black studies, and English studies curricula.\n\nClarke's fifth book of poetry, \"By My Precise Haircut\" (2016), is published by The Word Works Books of Washington, D.C., a press committed to the publication of contemporary poetry.\n\nCheryl Clarke is the author of \"Lesbianism: an Act of Resistance,\" originally published in 1981 in the feminist anthology \"This Bridge Called My Back: Writings by Radical Women of Color.\" The essay's main intervention is to expand the categories of who counts as a lesbian and what lesbianism is. Rather than defining a lesbian only as a woman who has sex with other women, Clarke insists that \"there is no one kind of lesbian, no one kind of lesbian behavior, and no one kind of lesbian relationship.\" Thinking of \"lesbian\" as a continuum, she makes space for women who may have sexual and emotional relationships with women but identify with other labels (bisexual, for instance). In the same way, she redefines lesbianism \"as an ideological, political, and philosophical means of liberation of all women from heterosexual tyranny.\" Because she imagines lesbianism to be in opposition to male tyranny and coerced heterosexuality, she defines it as resistance, no matter how a woman is actually practicing it in her personal life.\n\nClarke has served on a number of boards and community organizations, including New York Women Against Rape (1985), New Jersey Women and AIDS Network, Center for Lesbian and Gay Studies at the CUNY Graduate Center, and the Astraea Lesbian Foundation for Justice. Currently, she is a member of the Board of Directors of the Newark Pride Alliance, a not-for-profit organization dedicated to LGBTQ advocacy and programming in the city of Newark, New Jersey.

In 2005, Jessie and a friend of hers visited Florida together, and then stopped by Las Vegas on the way back in May where Jessie decided to stay.

After rising to notability as the founder of the COUM Transmissions artistic collective and then fronting the industrial band Throbbing Gristle, P-Orridge was a founding member of Thee Temple ov Psychick Youth occult group, and fronted the experimental band Psychic TV. P-Orridge identifies as third gender.\nBorn in Manchester, P-Orridge developed an early interest in art, occultism, and the avant-garde while at Solihull School. After dropping out of studies at the University of Hull, they moved into a counter-cultural commune in London and adopted \"Genesis P-Orridge\" as a nom-de-guerre. On returning to Hull, P-Orridge founded COUM Transmissions with Cosey Fanni Tutti, and in 1973 they relocated to London. COUM's confrontational performance work, dealing with such subjects as sex work, pornography, serial killers, and occultism, represented a concerted attempt to challenge societal norms and attracted the attention of the national press. COUM's 1976 \"Prostitution\" show at London's Institute of Contemporary Arts was particularly vilified by tabloids, gaining them the moniker of the \"wreckers of civilization\". P-Orridge's band, Throbbing Gristle, grew out of COUM, and were active from 1975 to 1981 as pioneers in the industrial music genre. In 1981, P-Orridge co-founded Psychic TV, an experimental band that from 1988 onward came under the increasing influence of acid house.\nIn 1981, P-Orridge co-founded Thee Temple ov Psychick Youth, an informal occult order influenced by chaos magic and experimental music. P-Orridge was often seen as the group's leader, but rejected that position, and left the group in 1991. Amid the Satanic ritual abuse hysteria, a 1992 Channel 4 documentary accused P-Orridge of sexually abusing children, resulting in a police investigation. P-Orridge was subsequently cleared and Channel 4 retracted their allegation. P-Orridge left the United Kingdom as a result of the incident and settled in New York City. There, P-Orridge married Jacqueline Mary Breyer, later known as Lady Jaye, in 1995, and together they embarked on the Pandrogeny Project, an attempt to unite as a \"pandrogyne\", or single entity, through the use of surgical body modification to physically resemble one another. P-Orridge continued with this project of body modification after Lady Jaye's 2007 death. Although involved in reunions of both Throbbing Gristle and Psychic TV in the 2000s, P-Orridge retired from music to focus on other artistic mediums in 2009. P-Orridge is credited on over 200 releases.\nA controversial figure with an anti-establishment stance, P-Orridge has been heavily criticised by the British press and politicians. P-Orridge has been cited as an icon within the avant-garde art scene, accrued a cult following, and been given the moniker of the \"Godperson of Industrial Music.\"\n\nGenesis P-Orridge was born Neil Andrew Megson on 22 February 1950 in Victoria Park, Longsight (part of the city of Manchester), to Ronald and Muriel Megson. Ronald was a travelling salesman who had worked in repertory theatre and who played the drums in local jazz and dance bands. Muriel was from Salford and had first met Ronald after he had returned to England after being injured with the British Army at the Battle of Dunkirk in 1940. As a child, P-Orridge had a good relationship with their parents, who did not interfere with their artistic interests.\n\nDue to Ronald's job, the family moved to Essex, Eastern England, where P-Orridge attended Staples Road Infant School in Loughton, and for a time lived in a caravan near to Epping Forest while the family house was being completed. The family then moved from Essex to Cheshire, North West England, where P-Orridge attended Gatley Primary School. Passing the 11-plus exam, P-Orridge won a scholarship to attend Stockport Grammar School, doing so between 1961 and 1964.\n\nAfter their father gained employment as the Midlands area manager of a cleaning and maintenance business, P-Orridge was sent to the privately run Solihull School in Warwickshire from 1964 through to 1968; a period they would refer to as \"basically four years of being mentally and physically tortured\", but also a time when he developed an interest in art, occultism and the avant-garde. Unpopular with other students, P-Orridge was bullied at the school, finding comfort in the art department at lunch-time and in the evenings. They befriended Ian \"Spydeee\" Evetts, Barry \"Little Baz\" Hermon and Paul Wolfson, three fellow students who shared their interest in art, literature and poetry. They regularly discussed books and music, developing an interest in the writings of Aleister Crowley, William S Burroughs, Jack Kerouac and Allen Ginsberg and the music of Frank Zappa, The Fugs and The Velvet Underground. P-Orridge became interested in occultism, and has also asserted that their grandmother was a medium.\n\nIn 1965, P-Orridge founded their first band, Worm, with school friends Peter Winstanley, Evetts and P-Orridge's girlfriend Jane Ray, which was influenced by John Cage's 1961 book \"\". In 1966, P-Orridge, Evetts, Hermon, Wolfson, and Winstanley began production of an underground magazine, entitled \"Conscience\". Forbidden from selling it on school grounds, they sold copies outside the school gates. Included in \"Conscience\" were various articles criticising the school's administration, leading to proposed changes regarding such issues as school uniforms and benchers' privileges. That same year, influenced by newspaper accounts of \"Swinging London\", P-Orridge organised the first happening at the school, doing so under the auspices of organising a school dance.\n\nBrought up in the Anglican denomination of Christianity, P-Orridge became secretary of the school sixth form's Christian Discussion Circle, in this position inviting members of other ideological positions – including a Marxist from the British Communist Party – to speak to the group. Aged 18, P-Orridge began helping to run the local Sunday School classes, but came to reject organised Christianity. Afflicted with asthma throughout childhood, P-Orridge had to take cortisone and prednisone steroids to control the attacks. The latter of these drugs caused his adrenal glands to atrophy as a side-effect, and so the doctor advised P-Orridge to stop taking them. As a result, aged 17 P-Orridge suffered from a serious blackout; while in hospital recovering he decided to devote his life to art and writing.\n\nWith Hermon and Wolfson, P-Orridge founded a group called the Knights of the Pentecostal Flame. The Knights undertook a happening on 1 June 1968 which they titled \"Beautiful Litter\". Taking place in Mell Square, Solihull, it involved the three students handing out cards to passersby that had a series of words written onto them; \"fleece\", \"rainbow\", \"silken\", \"white\", \"flower\" and \"dewdrops\". Ensuring that the local \"Solihull News\" was informed of the event, P-Orridge told reporters that the Knights wanted to ignite \"an artistic revolution in Solihull, by making people aware of the life around them, its essential beauty and tranquility.\" In the summer of 1968, Worm recorded their first and only album, entitled \"Early Worm\", in P-Orridge's parents' attic in Solihull. It was pressed onto vinyl in November at Deroy Sound Services in Manchester, but only one copy was ever produced. A second album, \"Catching the Bird\", was recorded but never pressed.\n\nIn September 1968, P-Orridge began studying for a degree in Social Administration and Philosophy at the University of Hull. Hull was chosen in an attempt to study at \"the most ordinary non-elitist, working-class, red brick university\", but P-Orridge disliked the course and unsuccessfully tried to transfer to study English. With a group of friends, he founded a 'free-form' student magazine entitled \"Worm\" which waived all editorial control, publishing everything placed into the magazine's pigeonhole, including instructions on how to build a molotov cocktail. Three issues were published between 1968 and 1970 before the Hull Student's Union banned the publication, considering it legally obscene and fearing prosecution. Developing a keen interest in poetry, P-Orridge won the 1969 Hull University Needler Poetry Competition, judged by Compton lecturer Richard Murphy and the poet Philip Larkin, who was then Chief Librarian at the university. P-Orridge became involved in radical student politics through their friendship with Tom Fawthrop, a member of the Radical Student Alliance who had led a student occupation of the university's administrative buildings as a part of the worldwide student protests of 1968. In 1969, P-Orridge attempted to reconstruct the occupation for a film, in the hopes that it would itself become a genuine protest occupation, but this venture failed due to a lack of participants.\n\nIn 1969, P-Orridge dropped out of university and moved to London, and joined the Transmedia Explorations commune, who were then living in a large run-down house in Islington Park Street. The group, initiated by the artist David Medalla and initially named the Exploding Galaxy, had been at the forefront of the London hippy scene since 1967, but had partially disbanded after a series of police raids and a damaging court case. Moving into their commune, P-Orridge was particularly influenced by one of the founding members of the group, Gerald Fitzgerald, a kinetic artist, and would recognise Fitzgerald's formative influence in P-Orridge's later work. The commune members adhered to a strict regime with the intention of deconditioning its members out of their routines and conventional behaviour; they were forbidden from sleeping in the same place on consecutive nights, food was cooked at irregular times of the day and all clothing was kept in a communal chest, with its members wearing something different on each day. P-Orridge stayed there for three months, until late October 1969. They left after becoming angered that the commune's leaders were given more rights than the other members and believing that the group ignored the counter-cultural use of music, something he took a great interest in. Julie Wilson later stated that although P-Orridge's time at the Transmedia Explorations commune had been brief, \"the experiences he had there proved to be seminal\" to their artistic development.\n\nLeaving London, P-Orridge hitch-hiked across Britain before settling down in the Megson family's new home in Shrewsbury. Here, P-Orridge volunteered as an office clerk in Ronald Megson's new business. On one family trip to Wales, P-Orridge was sitting in the back of the car, then \"became disembodied and heard voices and saw the COUM symbol and heard the words 'COUM Transmissions. Returning home that evening, P-Orridge filled three notebooks with artistic thoughts and ideas, influenced by the time spent at Transmedia Explorations.\nIn December 1969, P-Orridge returned to Hull to meet up with friend John Shappero, who partnered with P-Orridge to turn COUM Transmissions into an avant-garde artistic and musical troupe. They initially debated as to how to define \"COUM\", later deciding that like the name \"dada\" it should remain open to interpretation. P-Orridge designed a logo for the group, consisting of a semi-erect penis formed out of the word COUM with a drip of semen coming out of the end, while the motto \"Your Local Dirty Banned\" (a pun on \"band\") was emblazoned underneath. Another logo designed by P-Orridge consisted of a hand-drawn seal accompanied by the statement \"COUM guarantee disappointment\"; from their early foundation, the group made use of wordplay in their artworks and adverts.\n\nCOUM's earliest public events were impromptu musical gigs performed at various pubs around Hull; titles for these events included \"Thee Fabulous Mutations\", \"Space Between the Violins\", \"Dead Violins and Degradation\", and \"Clockwork Hot Spoiled Acid Test\". The latter combined the names of Anthony Burgess' dystopian science-fiction novel \"A Clockwork Orange\" (1962) with Tom Wolfe's \"The Electric Kool-Aid Acid Test\" (1968), a work of literary journalism devoted to the Merry Pranksters, a US communal counter-cultural group who advocated the use of psychedelic drugs. COUM's music was anarchic and improvised, making use of such instruments as broken violins, prepared pianos, guitars, bongos and talking drums. As time went on, they added further theatrics to their performances, in one instance making the audience crawl through a polythene tunnel to enter the venue.\n\nIn December 1969, P-Orridge and Shapiro moved out of their flat and into a former fruit warehouse in Hull's docking area, overlooking the Humber. Named the Ho-Ho Funhouse by P-Orridge, the warehouse became the communal home to an assortment of counter-cultural figures, including artists, musicians, fashion designers and underground magazine producers. At Christmas 1969, a woman named Christine Carol Newby moved into the Funhouse after being thrown out of her home by her father. Having earlier befriended P-Orridge at an acid test party, Newby became P-Orridge's roommate at the Funhouse, first taking the name Cosmosis, but latterly adopting the stage name Cosey Fanni Tutti after the title of Amadeus Mozart's 1790 opera \"Così fan tutte\". Joining COUM, Tutti initially helped in building props and designing costumes, and was there when the group began changing its focus from music to performance art and more theatrical happenings; shortly after Evetts, after being expelled from Solihull School joined COUM. The three of them lived in a derelict Georgian warehouse in Prince Street, Hull. An example performance involved the group turning up to play a gig but intentionally not bringing any instruments, something P-Orridge considered \"much more theatrical, farcical and light-hearted\" than their earlier performances.\n\nOn 5 January 1971, P-Orridge underwent a legal name change to Genesis P-Orridge by deed poll, combining the adopted nickname Genesis with an altered spelling of \"porridge\", the foodstuff which P-Orridge had lived off as a student. The new name was intentionally un-glamorous, and P-Orridge hoped that it would trigger a personal \"genius factor\". In February, COUM caught the attention of the \"Yorkshire Post\", which featured an article on them that led to further media attention from national newspapers. They also featured in an article in \"Torch\", the publication of the University of Hull's student union, entitled \"God Sucks Mary's Hairy Nipple\"; the article's author, Haydn Robb, subsequently joined COUM, as did maths lecturer Tim Poston. In April 1971, COUM broadcast their first live radio session, for the \"On Cue\" programme for Radio Humberside. Following up the press attention they received, they performed further happenings, including their first street action, \"Absolute Everywhere\", which brought problems with the police.\n\nAfter performing another set, \"Riot Control\", at Hull's Gondola Club, the premises was raided by police and closed soon after; most local clubs blamed COUM and unofficially banned them. COUM drew up a petition to gain support for the group, attaining a booking at the local Brickhouse; their first performance in which the audience applauded and called for an encore. The petition had contained their phallic logo, and the police charged P-Orridge and Nobb with publishing an obscene advert, although the charges were later dropped. As they gained coverage in the music press, interest in the band grew, and they supported Hawkwind at St. George's Hall in Bradford in October 1971, where they performed a piece called \"Edna and the Great Surfers\", where they led the crowd in shouting \"Off, Off, Off\". The following month, the band attracted the interest of music journalist John Peel, who publicly remarked that \"[s]ome might say that Coum were madmen but constant exposure to mankind forces me to believe that we need more madmen like them.\"\n\nGaining an Experimental Arts Grant from the publicly funded Yorkshire Arts Association, COUM described themselves as performance artists, being inspired by the Dadaists and emphasising the amateur quality of their work. They entered the National Rock/Folk Contest at Hull's New Grange Club with a set titled \"This Machine Kills Music\", and organised events for Hull City Council's celebrations to mark the UK's entry into the European Economic Community in 1973. P-Orridge had also worked on solo projects, generating controversy in the local press over a conceptual artwork the artist entered at a local exhibition. Taking an increasing interest in infantilism, P-Orridge founded the fictitious L'ecole de l'art infantile and co-organised the \"Baby's Coumpetition\" at Oxford University's 1973 May Festival, also producing material as the fictitious Ministry of Antisocial Insecurity, a parody of the Ministry of Social Security. Meanwhile, P-Orridge created the character of Alien Brain, and in July 1972 performed the \"World Premiere of The Alien Brain\" at Hull Arts Centre. COUM also began publishing books; in 1972, they brought out the first volume of \"The Million and One Names of COUM\", part of a proposed project to release 1001 slogans (such as \"A thousand and one ways to COUM\" and \"COUM are Fab and Kinky\"), while in 1973 P-Orridge published \"Copyright Breeches\", which explored an ongoing personal fascination with the copyright symbol and its implications for art and society.\n\nFollowing continual police harassment, P-Orridge and Tutti relocated to London, moving into a squat and obtaining a basement studio in Hackney which they named the \"Death Factory\". After a brief correspondence, P-Orridge met American novelist and poet William S. Burroughs. Brion Gysin would become a major influence upon P-Orridge's ideas and works and was the latter's primary tutor in spiritual magic. 1973 saw COUM take part in the \"Fluxshoe\" retrospective that toured Britain exhibiting the work of the Fluxus artists; it was organised by David Mayor, who befriended P-Orridge. At that year's Edinburgh Festival, P-Orridge undertook a Marcel Duchamp-inspired performance art piece, \"Art Vandals\", at the Richard Demarco Gallery, engaging guests in unconventional conversation, and spilling their food and drink on the floor. Exhibiting alongside the Viennese Actionists, P-Orridge came under increasing influence from these Austrian performance artists, adopting their emphasis on using shock tactics to combat conventional morality. P-Orrdige's first film, \"Wundatrek Tours\", was released in September 1973, and documented a day out to Brighton. Throughout the year the artist sent personally designed postcards to mail-art shows across the world.\n\nIn January 1974, COUM returned their attention to music, collaborating with the Canadian artist Clive Robertson to produce \"Marcel Duchamp's Next Work\", which they premiered at an arts festival in the Zwaarte Zaal in Ghent, Belgium. COUM's next major work was \"Couming of Age\", performed in March 1974 at the Oval House in Kennington, South London. After the show, they were approached by an audience member, Peter Christopherson, who shared many of their interests; P-Orridge and Tutti nicknamed him \"Sleazy\" because of his particular interest in the sexual aspects of COUM's work. He began to aid them using his skills as a photographer and graphic designer, and would first perform with them in their March 1975 work \"Couming of Youth\". In May 1974, COUM issued a manifesto published on an A3 double-sided sheet titled \"Decoumpositions and Events\".\n\nIn April 1974 the Arts Council of Great Britain gave COUM the first half of a £1,500 grant. The money stabilised the group, which now included P-Orridge and Tutti as directors, John Gunni Busck as technical director, and Lelli Maull as musical director. During that year, they made use of various artist-run venues in London, most notably the Art Meeting Place (AMP) in Covent Garden, where they regularly performed during 1974. A number of these works entailed P-Orridge and Tutti exploring the gender balance, including concepts of gender confusion. In one performance at the AWB, which was titled \"Filth\", P-Orridge and Tutti performed sexual acts using a double-ended dildo. COUM were frustrated with the restrictions imposed on them by the Arts Council as a prerequisite for receiving funding; rather than performing at Council-accredited venues, they wanted to perform more spontaneously. In August 1974 they carried out a spontaneous unauthorised piece of performance art in Brook Green, Hammersmith; during the performance, police arrived and put a stop to the event, deeming it obscene.\n\nIn September 1974, COUM were invited to attend the Stadfest in Rottweil, West Germany, and they proceeded with a travel grant from the British Council. There, they published two performance art actions in the street, earning them praise from Bridget Riley and Ernst Jandl, both of whom were present. The acclaim that COUM received at Rottweil established the group's reputation as \"one of the most innovative performance art groups then on the London art scene\", convincing the Arts Council and British Council to take them more seriously and offer them greater support.\n\nIn February 1975, P-Orridge gained his first full-time job, working as an assistant editor at St. James' Press, in which he helped to compile the \"Contemporary Artists\" reference book. The work meant that he had less time to devote to COUM but gained a wide range of contacts in the art world. During that year, COUM embarked on a series of five performance pieces which it termed \"Omissions\"; these were performed across Europe. In March 1975, COUM performed \"Couming of Youth\" at the Melkweg in Amsterdam. Adopting a more violent stance than their previous work – in this reflecting an influence from the Viennese Actionists – the performance involved self-mutilation, Cosey inserting lighted candles into her vagina, P-Orridge being crucified and whipped, and P-Orridge and Cosey having sexual intercourse. At Southampton's Nuffield Festival in July 1975, COUM performed \"Studio of Lust\", where P-Orridge publicly masturbated and all of the members undressed and adopted sexual poses.\n\nCOUM were introduced to Chris Carter in the summer of 1975 through their mutual friend John Lacey. Lacey believed that Carter would be interested in COUM as a result of his particular interest in the experimental use of light and sound. Together, Carter, Christopherson, Cosey and P-Orridge founded a musical band, Throbbing Gristle, on 3 September 1975; they had deliberately chosen that date for it was the 36th anniversary of the United Kingdom joining the Second World War. The term \"throbbing gristle\" was deliberately chosen for it was a Yorkshire slang term for an erect penis. Throbbing Gristle, or TG as it was widely known, was aimed at a wider audience than COUM, thereby aiming to work within popular culture rather than the elite realm of the art scene. COUM and TG were largely treated as distinct entities; the music press ignored COUM and saw TG as experimental art rock, while the arts press ignored TG, viewing COUM as performance artists. Despite their intention of operating within the realms of popular culture, TG never had chart success, and remained a cult band; their audience was however far larger than COUM.\n\nCOUM continued to operate alongside TG, and in October 1975 they performed \"Jusquà la balle crystal\"\" at the Ninth Paris Biennale at the Musée d'art modern. The prestige of being invited to such an event led to the Arts Council awarding them a grant for £1,600, although only the first half of this was ever paid out. COUM's mail art had taken on an increasingly pornographic dimension, and in November 1975 the police charged P-Orridge with distributing obscene material via in the postal system under the 1953 Post Office Act; this trial was set for February 1976.\nThey were prosecuted in 1975 for making collages combining postcards of Queen Elizabeth with soft-core porn, but the jail term and fines were suspended on condition they did not continue.\n\nTheir \"Prostitution\" show, in 1976 at the Institute of Contemporary Arts (ICA) in London, included displays of Tutti's pornographic images from magazines as well as erotic nude photographs; the show featured a stripper, used tampons in glass, and transvestite guards. Prostitutes, punks, and people in costumes were among those hired to mingle with the gallery audience. The show caused debate in Parliament about the public funding of such events. In the House of Commons, Scottish Conservative MP Sir Nicholas Fairbairn demanded an explanation from Arts Minister Harold Lever and proclaimed P-Orridge and Tutti as \"wreckers of civilisation\". Fleet Street was not slow to pick up the story. The reviews were cut up, framed, and put on display for the remainder of the exhibition. This was also reported in newspapers, so cut-ups about the cut-ups were also put on display. COUM was found so offensive that it lost its government grant, and went on to become the private company Industrial Records. Toward the end of COUM, performances would often consist of only P-Orridge, Cosey and Sleazy, the core group who went on to form Throbbing Gristle.\n\nThrobbing Gristle was formed in the autumn of 1975 as a four-piece band, consisting of P-Orridge, Cosey Fanni Tutti, Peter \"Sleazy\" Christopherson and Chris Carter.\nThe name \"Throbbing Gristle\" was adopted after a Northern English slang term for an erect penis. P-Orridge's involvement in Throbbing Gristle led to the artist being regularly cited as the \"Godfather of Industrial Music\", or in some later sources, \"godparent\".\n\nThe first Throbbing Gristle performance was held at the Air Gallery in London in July 1976. At that point, Throbbing Gristle's headquarters was located at 10 Martello Street, Hackney, East London, the address of an artist collective. P-Orridge and Tutti's living and work space was the mailing address of Industrial Records (IR). Throbbing Gristle released \"Discipline\" in 1980. TG came to be identified as the founders of industrial music, although at the same time the academic Drew Daniel asserted that as a result of its eclecticism, their music resists clear analysis.\n\nThrobbing Gristle's best-selling single was \"Zyklon B Zombie\" (1978), the title being a reference to the Zyklon B poison gas used at Auschwitz extermination camp. With their album \"20 Jazz Funk Greats\" they attempted to move away from their industrial sound, and produced songs in a variety of different musical genres. P-Orridge received a number of threatening phone calls, proceeding to record them and use them as a backing track for the TG song \"Death Threats\".\n\nThe final IR release was called \"Nothing Here Now But the Recordings\", a best-of album taken from the archives of William S. Burroughs, who provided P-Orridge and Christopherson with access to his reel-to-reel tape archive.\n\nThe final Throbbing Gristle live event, \"Mission of Dead Souls\", occurred in May 1981 at the Kezar Pavilion in San Francisco, US. Shortly after the San Francisco event, P-Orridge and Paula P-Orridge (née Alaura O'Dell) were married.\n\nDuring this period, P-Orridge befriended an English musician named David Bunting; P-Orridge already knew another man named David, so coined the moniker David Tibet, which Bunting adopted as a stage name. Through an introduction provided by Burroughs, P-Orridge met Brion Gysin in Paris, probably in 1980, coming to be deeply influenced by Gysin's cut-up method; P-Orridge understood this to be a revolutionary method of escaping current patterns of thought and developing something new.\n\nFollowing the break-up of Throbbing Gristle, in 1981 P-Orridge founded a band with Peter Christopherson and Alex Fergusson that they named Psychic TV. Involved in video art, they also performed psychedelic, punk, electronic and experimental music. The decision to name the band \"Psychic TV\" stemmed from P-Orridge's belief that while mainstream television was a form of mass indoctrination and mind control, it could be used as an \"esoterrorist\" form of magick to combat the establishment's control. Historian Dave Evans described Psychic TV as \"a band dedicated to musical eclecticism and magical experiment, their performances being in part ritual (ab)use of sound samples, the creation of 'auditory magical sigils' and the destruction of consensus language in order to find meaning\".\n\nThe band's first song, \"Just Drifting\", was based on a poem by P-Orridge. For their first album, \"Force the Hand of Chance\" (1982), P-Orridge used a kangling, or Tibetan trumpet made out of a human thigh-bone; the instrument had been introduced to P-Orridge by David Tibet, and attracted attention to their music. P-Orridge had become acquainted with Anton LaVey, founder of the Church of Satan and ideologue of LaVeyan Satanism, with LaVey making an appearance on the Psychic TV song \"Joy\", in which he recites the Lord's Prayer backwards. From 1988, the band came under the increasing influence of the acid house genre of dance music, and were responsible for helping the popularisation of acid house music in Europe.\n\nPsychic TV made its debut in 1982 at an event organised by P-Orridge, David Dawson, and Roger Ely, called \"The Final Academy\". It was a 4-day multimedia celebratory rally held in Manchester and at the Ritzy Cinema in Brixton, South London. It brought performers and audience together with literature, performance, film and music. PTV, Cabaret Voltaire, 23 Skidoo, Z'EV, John Giorno, William S. Burroughs, Brion Gysin, Terry Wilson, Jeff Nuttall, and The Last Few Days participated to honour the cut-up techniques and theories of William S. Burroughs, Ian Sommerville, Antony Balch and Gysin. Video projection and early sampling were used here, as well as whispered utterances by P-Orridge reprocessed as a soundtrack to Gysin's Dreammachine by the Hafler Trio. In the mid-eighties, Psychic TV aimed to release a live album on the 23rd of each month for 23 months in recognition of the 23 enigma. The group didn't reach its goal but still managed fourteen albums in eighteen months, thus earning them an entry in the Guinness Book of World Records. Following the culmination of Psychic TV but before embarking on Thee Majesty, P-Orridge and several Psychic TV musicians formed Splinter Test, a name adopted from one of P-Orridge's essays on sampling.\n\nIn 1981, P-Orridge also founded a loosely organised network of occultists named Thee Temple ov Psychick Youth (TOPY), with the aid of Balance, Tibet, and a number of members of the Process Church of the Final Judgement, a group which had exerted an influence on P-Orridge's occult thought. TOPY was conceived not as an occult order of teaching, but a forum to facilitate discussions on occult ideas by like-minded people, and from its beginnings was understood by its founders to be a successor to the late 19th and early 20th century Ordo Templi Orientis (OTO), especially as the latter had been run under Crowley's leadership. Evans described TOPY as \"a 'fusion' organisation, creating a crossover of punk/experimental music with chaos magical thinking and practice\", making particular use of the sigilisation practices of occult artist Austin Osman Spare. Journalist Gavin Baddeley described TOPY as \"perhaps the most influential new occult order of the 1980s\". P-Orridge had never wanted to be seen as the leader of an occult order, although many of those involved in TOPY were frustrated that outsiders regularly described P-Orridge as the group's leader. Accordingly, P-Orridge separated from TOPY in 1991, although it continued as a fan community after the departure.\n\nHaving been encouraged by Christian groups involved in propagating the moral panic about alleged Satanic ritual abuse, the Channel 4 1992 documentary show \"Dispatches\" claimed to have discovered videotapes depicting P-Orridge sexually abusing children in a ritual setting. Police from the Obscene Publications Squad subsequently raided P-Orridge's home, and confiscated several tonnes of art work. At the time, P-Orridge was in Thailand undertaking famine-relief work; fearing arrest and loss of child custody upon return to the UK, P-Orridge stayed out of the country for several years, settling in the United States. P-Orridge believed that the negative press and police attention were the result of a vendetta conceived by a right-wing fundamentalist Christian group. It was subsequently revealed that the footage obtained did not depict child abuse. Instead, it was a video artwork titled \"First Transmissions\" that had been made in the early 1980s, partially funded by Channel 4 themselves; the footage depicted sex-magic rites between adults, blood-letting performances, and scenes of the filmmaker Derek Jarman reading passages from the work of Geoffrey Chaucer. Embarrassed by these revelations, Channel 4 retracted their initial accusations.\n\nIn January 1993, Genesis and second wife to-be, Lady Jaye (née Jacqueline Breyer), moved to Ridgewood, Queens in New York City. Here they embarked on the \"Pandrogeny Project\"; influenced by the cut-up technique, the duo underwent body modification to resemble one another, thus coming to identify themselves as a single pandrogynous being named \"Breyer P-Orridge\". In doing so, the pair spent $200,000 on surgical alteration, receiving breast implants, cheek and chin implants, lip plumping, eye and nose jobs, tattooing, and hormone therapy, while also adopting gender neutral and alternating pronouns. With this project, P-Orridge's intent was to express a belief that the self is pure consciousness trapped within the DNA-governed body. The couple adopted the term \"pandrogyne\" because – in their words – \"we wanted a word without any history or any connections with things – a word with its own story and its own information\".\nHe also stated that:\n\nDuring this era, a book was published of Breyer P-Orridge's writings, poems, and observations, called \"Ooh, You Are Awful ... But I Like You!\". In the mid-1990s, Breyer P-Orridge collaborated with different people in music, including Pigface, Skinny Puppy, and Download. Breyer P-Orridge also performed with Nik Turner and other former members of Hawkwind.\n\nIn June 1998, Breyer P-Orridge won a $1.5 million lawsuit against producer Rick Rubin and his American Recordings label for injuries sustained while trying to escape a fire at Rubin's home in April 1995. According to Breyer P-Orridge's attorney, David D. Stein, Breyer P-Orridge was staying at Rubin's home, as a guest of Love and Rockets, when the fire broke out. Breyer P-Orridge tried to escape the house by crawling through a second-story window and fell onto concrete stairs. Between them, Breyer P-Orridge suffered a broken wrist, broken ribs, and a pulmonary embolism, as well as a shattered left elbow that, according to Stein, has prevented P-Orridge from playing bass or keyboards. They remained in hospital for a total of ten days. The jury found that the liability for the fire rested with Rubin and American Recordings, and awarded Breyer P-Orridge US$1,572,000 in compensation.\n\nIn 1999, Breyer P-Orridge performed with the briefly reunited late-1980s version of Psychic TV for an event at London's Royal Festival Hall, called \"Time's Up\". The MC for the event, via pre-recorded video, was Quentin Crisp, it was recorded and released as a DVD. \"Time's Up\" is also the title of the first CD by Thee Majesty, Breyer P-Orridge's spoken-word project with \"noise\" guitarist, Bryin Dall.\n\nIn December 2003, Breyer P-Orridge, using the alias \"Djinn\", unveiled PTV3, a new act drawing upon the early \"Hyperdelic\" work of Psychic TV with media theorist Douglas Rushkoff among its members. On 16 May 2004 all four former members of Throbbing Gristle performed at the London Astoria for the first time in 23 years.\n\nBreyer P-Orridge appeared in the 1998 film and 2000 book versions of \"Modulations\", in the 1999 film Better Living Through Circuitry, in the 2004 film \"DiG!\", the 2006 documentary , in Nik Sheehan's 2007 feature documentary on the Dreamachine entitled 'FLicKeR', and the 2010 documentary \"\".\n\nIn January 2006, the new PTV album was announced on P-Orridge's website. \"Hell Is Invisible... Heaven Is Her/e\" was recorded in NYC and features Nick Zinner (Yeah Yeah Yeahs) and Gibby Haynes (Butthole Surfers) guesting on some tracks. To inaugurate the release of \"Hell Is Invisible ... Heaven Is Her/e\", PTV3 hosted a five night residency in September 2006 at Galapagos Art Space in Williamsburg, Brooklyn, New York. \"Mr. Alien Brain Vs. the Skinwalkers\" was released on Sweet Nothing Records on 8 December 2008.\n\nOn 9 October 2007, Lady Jaye Breyer P-Orridge died. The cause of death was a heart condition that was possibly related to stomach cancer. Psychic TV cancelled its North American tour dates in the aftermath of Lady Jaye's death. A memorial was held at the Participant Inc. Gallery in New York City on 8 March 2008 . As of January 2013, P-Orridge's official website says, \"Since that time Genesis continues to represent the amalgam Breyer P-Orridge in the material 'world' and Lady Jaye represents the amalgam Breyer P-Orridge in the immaterial 'world' creating an ongoing interdimensional collaboration.\" Thus, P-Orridge continued the Pandrogyne Project, having further surgical operations to alter their body and using \"we\" when in reference to themselves; however, to a reporter P-Orridge admitted that without Lady Jaye, \"It's very hard. The bottom line is that we know she would continue. She wouldn't stop because it was complicated.\" From this point, P-Orridge began referring to themselves in the plural in order to keep Breyer's memory alive.\n\nIn September 2009, a retrospective of P-Orridge's collages, entitled \"30 Years of Being Cut Up\", opened at Invisible-Exports.\nOn 4 November 2009 it was announced that P-Orridge would retire from touring in any and all bands (including Throbbing Gristle and Psychic TV) to concentrate on art, writing and music.\n\nIn June 2010, P-Orridge sold the Ridgewood property, holding a garage sale in the basement of a local art gallery to sell off a range of personal items, in addition to an array of dildos. This accomplished, P-Orridge moved to a one-bedroom apartment in New York's Lower East Side, and continued producing art in this home. P-Orridge returned to touring with Psychic TV in 2016 with the release of their album \"Alienist\". The tour lasted from mid-September to early December, with concerts in Greece, Israel, Poland, Russia, Ukraine, the United Kingdom and the United States.\n\nIn August 2015, P-Orridge gained publicity for an interview critical of Caitlyn Jenner's self-description as a \"spokesperson\" for the transgender community, stating that Jenner was \"clueless\" and did not know what life was like for the majority of transgender people around the world.\nIn the summer of 2016, P-Orridge's artwork was the subject of an exhibition, \"Try to Altar Everything\", at the Rubin Museum of Art in New York City. The exhibition contained paintings, sculptures, and installations inspired by the Hindu mythology that P-Orridge had encountered in Kathmandu. In June 2016, P-Orridge featured as a model in a campaign by the designer Marc Jacobs, who described P-Orridge as \"a sort of come-to-life definition of realness and authenticity\".\n\nInfluenced by concepts from both Western esotericism and contemporary Paganism, P-Orridge's work is designed to confront the audience with ways of thinking alien to the mainstream values of Western society. The religious studies scholar Christopher Partridge characterised P-Orridge's work as being a \"confluence of pornography, violence, death, degradation, the confrontation of taboo subjects, noise and Paganism\", deliberately courting controversy and expressing an anti-establishment stance. Partridge suggested that this intent to shock emerged both out of a serious attempt to highlight the mechanisms of social control in Western society and also out of \"a juvenile delight gained from extreme behaviour and the offence caused\".\n\nP-Orridge's work was particularly influenced by the early 20th-century English artist and occultist Austin Osman Spare, who shared his disdain for mainstream morality and fascination with sexuality and the human body. P-Orridge adopted Spare's views on sigils, coming to see their own work as a form of sigil magic. Spare's sigilisation process entailed writing down one's desires, before crossing out any letters that are repeated and then combining the remaining letters into an abstract design, or sigil; the magician must then focus on that sigil and mentally absorb it, and – according to Spare's claims – psychic energies operating on the subconscious ensure that the original desire is manifested in reality. P-Orridge adopted this theory, believing that their work operates according to its principles.\n\nA further element of P-Orridge's work is their common use of idiosyncratically use of grammar and spelling, such as \"Thee\" in place of \"the\", \"ov\" in place of \"of\" and (especially in early writings) \"butter\" in place of \"but\". The purpose of this is to challenge thought and established ways of reading.\n\nP-Orridge has two daughters, Caresse and Genesse, with former wife Paula P-Orridge (born Paula Brooking). An interview with Genesis and Paula P-Orridge appeared in the book \"RE/Search: Modern Primitives\" in 1989, and the Icelandic publication \"Eintak\" in 1994.\n\nOn a religious or spiritual level, Christopher Partridge described P-Orridge as representing \"a particularly interesting, influential and subversive example of contemporary Paganism.\" Asserting that P-Orridge's \"Industrial Paganism\" was different from most forms of contemporary Paganism, Partridge described it as \"confrontational, subversive, experimental and, to a large extent, dystopian\", with it serving as \"an ideological tool\" with which to analyse society \"from its underbelly; an immersion in the dark side; the subversion of Christian hegemony, conservative politics and what nowadays might be described as neoliberalism\".\nP-Orridge is devoted to the deity Eshu Elegguá, an entity from the Afro-Caribbean syncretic religion of Santería. However, P-Orridge has also stated a disbelief in the literal existence of gods, deeming such entities to instead be \"early attempts at psychology, trying to understand the light and dark side of human nature\".\n\nP-Orridge has vociferously criticized contemporary Christianity, describing it as \"an incredibly sick social pseudo-religion\", and arguing that it was based upon the tenet of \"Be good now, agree, or else we will punish you forever and ever when you're dead. And we may punish you while you're alive ...\" P-Orridge maintains that such an attitude was established in Christianity by St. Paul and the early Roman Catholic Church, and that it differed from the \"ecstatic mysticism of the original Christianity, the Gnostic Christianity\".\n\nP-Orridge was diagnosed with chronic myelomonocytic leukemia in October 2017. As a consequence their scheduled appearance at the Hobart/Launceston Mofo Festival, 20–21 Jan 2018, (with Edley O'Dowd), was cancelled.\n\nAccording to \"New York\" magazine, P-Orridge became \"an icon of the London avant-garde\" in 1976.\nWriting for \"The New Yorker\" in 2016, the reporter Hermione Hoby described P-Orridge as a \"cult figure\" considered to be \"a treasure of the avant-garde by global art institutions\".\n\nNote: this is for releases specifically credited to Genesis P-Orridge, for work with PTV see Psychic TV discography, for work with Throbbing Gristle see Throbbing Gristle discography.

{"id": "67575", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=67575", "title": "Gustave Moreau", "text": "Gustave Moreau\n\nGustave Moreau (; 6 April 1826 – 18 April 1898) was a major figure in French Symbolist painting whose main emphasis was the illustration of biblical and mythological figures. As a painter, Moreau appealed to the imaginations of some Symbolist writers and artists. \nHe is recognized for his works that are influenced by the Italian Renaissance and exoticism. His art work was preserved in Paris at the Musée Gustave Moreau.\n\nHe was born in Paris, France, at 6 Rue des Saints-Peres. He came from a middle-class family. His father, Louis Jean Marie Moreau, was an architect for the city of Paris and his mother, née Adele Pauline Desmoutier, was an accomplished musician. Gustave Moreau lived a sheltered life growing up. Having visited Italy at age 15 he began his love for art. At age 18 he entered École des Beaux-Arts to study under the guidance of François-Édouard Picot and left in 1850. He then began to study art under his new mentor Théodore Chassériau, whose work strongly influenced his own. Moreau participated in the Salon for the first time in 1852.\n\nMoreau had a 25-year personal, possibly romantic relationship, with Adelaide-Alexandrine Dureux (b.Guise, 8 November 1835), a woman whom he drew several times. His first painting was a \"Pietà\" which is now located in the cathedral at Angoulême. He showed \"A Scene from the Song of Songs\" and \"The Death of Darius\" in the Salon of 1853. In 1853, he contributed \"Athenians with the Minotaur\" and \"Moses Putting Off his Sandals within Sight of the Promised Land\" to the Great Exhibition.\n\n\"Oedipus and the Sphinx\", one of his first Symbolist paintings, was exhibited at the Salon of 1864. Moreau quickly gained a reputation for eccentricity. One commentator said Moreau's work was \"like a pastiche of Mantegna created by a German student who relaxes from his painting by reading Schopenhauer.\" The painting currently resides in the permanent collection at the New York Metropolitan Museum of Art.\n\nOn 28 March 1890, Alexandrine Dureux died. Her death affected Moreau greatly, and his work after this point contained a more melancholic edge. She was buried at the same cemetery that Moreau himself would be laid to rest (see below).\n\nMoreau became a professor at Paris' École des Beaux-Arts in October 1891. Among his many students were fauvist painters Henri Matisse and Georges Rouault. Jules Flandrin, Theodor Pallady and Léon Printemps also studied with Moreau.\n\nMoreau died of stomach cancer and was buried at the Cimetière de Montmartre in Paris in his parent's tomb.\n\nHe was made a Chevalier de la Legion d'honneur in 1875 and was promoted to an Officier de la Legion d'honneur in 1883.\n\nThe death of Chasseriau in 1856 caused Moreau in his grief to stop painting and withdraw from public life. Concerned about his condition, Moreau's parents suggested he travel to Italy again. Living in Italy from 1857 to 1859 he found a new love for art. He gained inspiration from the artists of the Italian Renaissance, such as Leonardo da Vinci and Michelangelo. In 1864 Moreau won a medal at the Salon with his painting \"Oedipus and the Sphinx\", the style of which revealed his close study of the work of Mantegna and Giovanni Bellini. Its firm outlines and detailed modeling are typical of the works that brought him success with critics and the public for the remainder of the decade. In the 1870s, disturbed by criticism that his work had become formulaic, he stopped exhibiting for a few years while he concentrated on renewing his art. In 1876 he completed \"Salome Dancing Before Herod\", which announced a more painterly style that would characterize his later works.\n\nGustave Moreau's education in classical drawing did not stop him from experimenting with different styles of art. By traveling to other countries such as Italy or Holland and reading publications Moreau was able to develop his unique form of art. The most important publications Moreau owned were \"The Grammar of Ornament\" by Owen Jones, \"Le costume historique\" by August Racinet, and \"Le Costume\" by Frederick Hottenroth. All these influences led Moreau to draw not only humans, but animals and architectural monuments. Moreau started his career drawing classical art, but by incorporating exotic images he developed a mysterious and unique form of art.\n\nDuring his lifetime, Moreau produced more than 8,000 paintings, watercolors and drawings. His work influenced the next generation of Symbolists, particularly Odilon Redon and Jean Delville, a leading figure in Belgian Symbolism in the early part of the twentieth century. Many of Moreau'e works are on display in Paris' Musée national Gustave Moreau at 14 rue de la Rochefoucauld (9th arrondissement). The museum is in his former workshop, and began operation in 1903. André Breton famously used to \"haunt\" the museum and regarded Moreau as a precursor of Surrealism.\n\nThe Japanese artist Yoshitaka Amano, known for works such as \"Final Fantasy\", \"Angel's Egg\", and \"Vampire Hunter D\", was inspired by Moreau's style. Amano said in an interview that when he was first experimenting with styles to try to find his own, he would try to mimic the works of Moreau.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "10867904", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=10867904", "title": "José Luis de Jesús", "text": "José Luis de Jesús\n\nJosé Luis de Jesús Miranda (April 22, 1946 – November 17, 2013) was the leader of the Creciendo en Gracia cult, based in Miami, Florida. He claimed to be both the returned phase of Jesus Christ and the Antichrist; he was known for making statements that opposed the precepts of the Roman Catholic Church but that followed his interpretation of the Bible. He was previously known as \"el Jesucristo Hombre\" (which translates, roughly, to \"the Man Jesus-Christ\") but shortly after his death, his followers granted him the title of Melchizedek because, as stated by his official site, he attained his new and final name which means king of justice and king of peace. Footage from one of his sermons as well as an interview with comedian Bill Maher are included in the 2008 documentary film \"Religulous\".\n\nJosé Luis de Jesús was born in Ponce, Puerto Rico to parents Antonio de Jesús and Ana Luisa Miranda. He claimed that during his youth, he served stints in prison for petty theft because of the poor conditions that he was living on, and that he was already addicted to heroin at age 14. He stated that it was the \"power of God what took me out of my drug addiction\" and he soon joined a Baptist Church in his city.\n\nJosé Luis was promoted to minister after serving several years in the church. Miranda claims that in 1973, he had a vision in which he maintains that he was visited by a pair of angels. The impact on Miranda was significant; as he later told ABC News: \"The same spirit that was in Jesus of Nazareth, and the same spirit is in me. He came to me. He [integrated] with my person in 1973.\" It was not long before Miranda started preaching his own ideals and teachings. José Luis moved his then-wife Nydia and five children to South Florida, where he secured a 15-minute time slot from the radio station WVCG-AM to begin preaching. \n\nHe started to assemble a select number of followers which culminated in the forming of \"Ministerio Creciendo en Gracia\" (Spanish for \"Growing in Grace\") in 1988. At first, José Luis was only preaching according to the Four Gospels that narrate the life and teachings of Jesus Christ, but in 1998, he claimed that he was the reincarnation of Paul the Apostle and changed his focus into reading and preaching about Paul's gospel.\n\n\"Creciendo en Gracia\" first started in Miami, Florida and soon expanded into different places in the United States and Latin America. On April 22, 2002, he married Josefina Torres, a woman that he met during one of his trips to Bogotá in 1999. In 2005, he announced that he was the next phase of Jesus Christ on Earth and self-proclaimed \"Jesus Christ Man\". In 2007, the \"Dallas Morning News\" reported that de Jesús \"preaches to followers in some 35 nations, mostly in Latin America, and has 287 radio programs and a 24-hour Spanish and English-language TV-network .\" He claimed to have two million followers in 30 countries by 2008.\n\nOn August 8, 2013, Miranda’s ex-wife, Josefina Torres, claimed that Miranda had died in Sugar Land, Texas on August 8, 2013, apparently of cirrhosis of the liver. However, on September 11, Miranda reappeared in public, proclaiming himself in good health. On November 15, Miranda actually died in Orlando, Florida, with his death confirmed by both his movement and his family. Miranda's death has remained controversial among his followers. Publicly, his church has continued to insist that Miranda has not \"died\" and that he is immortal. He was buried on November 22, 2013 in a ceremony in which only his family and certain followers assisted.\n\nIn late 2006, he claimed that he was the Antichrist. He stated that the term was appropriate because people are no longer required to follow the \"Jewish teachings\" of Jesus of Nazareth, but rather to follow the apostle Paul's teachings through De Jesús. According to de Jesús, \"Antichrist\" means \"no longer following Jesus of Nazareth as he lived in the days of his flesh\". Followers showed their support by getting \"666\" tattoos on their bodies. One of Miranda's followers in Havana, Cuba tattooed the symbol on her three-year-old son. A YouTube video of the mother holding the child as he was tattooed was widely circulated in January 2013. \"666\", de Jesús said, is not a sign of the devil (he preaches that the devil was destroyed) but instead is the number of the Antichrist and that the number is \"a number of wisdom and it displays who is really following the truthful words of Jesus Christ\".\n\nHis followers celebrate Christmas each year on April 22, as this is the day de Jesús was born and therefore they claim it is the \"real\" Christmas.\n\nAccording to his followers, there was to have been a Transformation day in which members would have supposedly been able to walk through walls and go through fire and not get burned, this because they would have been \"fully enlightened and living with an immortal body\". José Luis stated that his transformation and that of his followers would occur between June 30, 2012 and July 1, 2012 (sources Huffington Post and Miami New Times dispute the exact hour).\n\nJosé Luis de Jesús Miranda separated from his wife in 2007 because, according to her, \"he started to say that he was God; I was not comfortable with that, so he threatened me by sending death-angels to my sons if I didn't do whatever he wanted\". She also alleged that he liked to send her far away from home for long periods of time because \"he was seeing other women, some of them from \"Creciendo en Gracia\"\".\n\nDocuments provided to the court by Josefina's attorney demonstrated that José Luis spent extravagantly during the time of the marriage, and used church funds to maintain his lifestyle. One gambling debt to Hard Rock Casino was over $46,000 dollars. Jo-Ann De Jesús, José Luis' daughter and Church treasurer, testified that de Jesús' first wife, Nydia Vélez, receives $12,000 in monthly alimony paid for by the church. Finally, the church bought multiple properties for José Luis in Florida, Texas and Colombia using Church funds and signing the title over to José Luis or Jo-Ann De Jesús.\n\nRoberto Piñeiro, the judge in charge of the divorce case, gave an unfavorable verdict towards de Jesús in 2008 and, according to the Miami Herald, Josefina Torres received $2.2 million in properties and estates as compensation. José Luis stated afterwards that he sent \"angels of fair retribution to seek for justice\" against the judge. Roberto Piñeiro died on December 9, 2010 of a stroke, much to the delight of Miranda's followers. \n\nAfter the death of José Luis de Jesús Miranda, the great majority of the followers did not want anything more to do with the sect, but some decided to remain united. However, because of the internal struggles for leadership and rival ambition of their leaders, after six months the group had already divided into four factions with different doctrinal positions and social agendas. As a result, it can be said that the sect really ended with the death of José Luis de Jesús Miranda, and that the four factions, which have only retained a meager influence, constitute new movements. These are:\n\n(1°) \"La Amada de Jesucristo\" (\"The Beloved of Jesus Christ\") or \"Paloma\" (\"Dove\"), directed by Andrés Cudris [Already deceased],\n\n(2°) \"La Ciencia de JH\" (\"The Science of JH\"), directed by Emilio Gramajo,\n\n(3°) \"TV Gracia\" (\"Grace TV\") directed by Luis Martín Guío, and\n\n(4 °) \"Rey de Salem, El Gobierno de Dios, Melquisedec-Lisbeth\" (\"King of Salem, The Government of God, Melchizedec-Lisbeth\"), directed by Lisbeth García (Widow of José Luis de Jesús Miranda).\n\n\n"}

{"id": "852529", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=852529", "title": "Mark Eaton (basketball)", "text": "Mark Eaton (basketball)\n\nMark E. Eaton (born January 24, 1957) is an American retired professional basketball player who was a member of the National Basketball Association's Utah Jazz from 1982 to 1993, with one NBA All-Star selection in 1989, and two NBA Defensive Player of the Year awards in 1985 and 1989. Though limited offensively, Eaton's height helped him become one of the best defensive centers in NBA history. Eaton holds the NBA record for most blocks in a season (456) and career average blocked shots per game (3.50).\n\nEaton was born in Inglewood, California and grew up in Southern California. Despite his height, as a youth he was more interested in playing water polo than basketball. After graduating from Westminster High School, Eaton attended the Arizona Automotive Institute in Phoenix and graduated as a service technician. He worked as an auto mechanic for about three years, and was eventually discovered by Tom Lubin while repairing cars in Anaheim in April 1977. Lubin, a chemistry professor, was an assistant basketball coach at Cypress Junior College, and his encouragement led Eaton to enroll at Cypress and try out for the basketball team. Eaton developed into a solid junior college player. He averaged 14.3 points per game in two seasons at Cypress, and led the school to the California State Title as a sophomore.\n\nAfter his freshman year at Cypress, he was drafted by the Phoenix Suns in the 1979 NBA draft with the 107th pick in the 5th round. He was eligible to be drafted because he was already four years out of high school in 1979. However, he opted to return to college basketball.\n\nEaton transferred to University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA) in 1980, but did not see much action in his two seasons with the Bruins. In his senior season, he played just 42 total minutes, averaging 1.3 points and 2.0 rebounds in 11 games. Eaton was initially disappointed with his inability to play effectively as a Division 1 collegiate player. Wilt Chamberlain, who frequently attended UCLA practices after his retirement from the NBA, saw Eaton's frustration and, on one occasion, personally took him under a basket to explain that Eaton needed to focus on protecting the basket, getting rebounds, and passing the ball to quicker guards, rather than trying to compete with smaller, quicker players in scoring. Eaton has cited Chamberlain's advice as the turning point in his basketball career.\n\nBecause of his lack of playing time at UCLA, few NBA teams had interest in Eaton after he finished his college career. However, the Utah Jazz saw him as a potentially dominant defender and selected him with the 72nd pick in the fourth round of the 1982 NBA draft. Utah coach Frank Layden would later explain his choice by quoting Red Auerbach's old axiom, \"you can't teach height\". In his rookie season, Eaton made an immediate impact. He replaced Danny Schayes as Utah's starting center early in the year, and finished the season with 275 blocked shots (a franchise record) in 81 games. His 3.40 blocks per game ranked third in the NBA, behind Atlanta's Wayne \"Tree\" Rollins and San Diego's Bill Walton.\n\nEaton continued to improve in his second season with the Jazz. In 82 games, he grabbed a team-leading 595 rebounds and blocked 351 shots (breaking his own franchise record). His 4.28 blocks per game led the NBA, well ahead of Rollins (who finished second with 3.60 blocks per game). Eaton's strong defense helped the Jazz make their first-ever playoff appearance. Incidentally, one shot he failed to block during the 1983–84 season was the skyhook which gave Kareem Abdul-Jabbar his 31,421st point and the NBA's all-time scoring record.\n\nEaton's third season (1984–85) was spectacular. He blocked 456 shots, shattering the NBA record for most blocked shots in a single season set during the 1973–74 season by Elmore Smith who had blocked 393 shots for the Los Angeles Lakers. Eaton averaged 5.56 blocks per game, more than double the league's second ranked blocker (Houston's Hakeem Olajuwon with 2.68 blocks per game). In addition, Eaton averaged 11.3 rebounds per game, ranking fifth in the league in that category. For his efforts, he was named to the NBA All-Defensive First Team and was honored as the NBA's Defensive Player of the Year.\n\nAlthough he was not a significant offensive contributor, the Jazz relied heavily on Eaton for his shot-blocking, rebounding, and occasional \"tippy toe\" dunks. With the emergence of superstars Karl Malone and John Stockton, the Jazz became one of the best teams in the NBA. Eaton's stifling defense was a major factor in Utah's success. He continued to rank among NBA leaders in blocked shots, leading the league in 1986–87 and 1987–88. In 1988–89, he averaged 10.3 rebounds per game (seventh in the NBA) and 3.84 blocks per game (second behind Golden State's Manute Bol). He was named NBA Defensive Player of the Year for the second time in his career, and was also named to the NBA All-Defensive First Team (for the third time in his career). In addition, he was chosen to play in the 1989 NBA All-Star Game, joining teammates Malone and Stockton on the Western Conference team.\n\nIn his last few years with the Jazz, Eaton was slowed by knee and back injuries. He remained an imposing defensive presence, but his rebounding and shot-blocking abilities slowly declined. In his last season (1992–93), he played in only 64 games, averaging just 17.3 minutes per game.\n\nHis entire NBA career was spent with the Utah Jazz. In 875 games, he scored 5,216 points, grabbed 6,939 rebounds, and blocked 3,064 shots. At the time of his retirement, he ranked second all-time in league history in total blocked shots, behind Kareem Abdul-Jabbar's career total of 3,189. Abdul-Jabbar played 1,560 games to Eaton's 875. (However, statistics for blocked shots were not kept until the 1973–74 season, missing the first four seasons of Abdul-Jabbar's career.) Eaton is currently the NBA's all-time leader in blocks per game, with a career average of 3.50.\n\nTo honor his contributions to the team, the Utah Jazz retired Eaton's number 53 during the 1995–96 regular season. In 2010, Eaton was inducted into The Utah Sports Hall of Fame.\n\nMark now spends most his time teaching \"The Four Commitments of a Team\" to corporations nationwide through his company 7ft4.com. \nSince his retirement, Eaton has worked for KJZZ-TV in Salt Lake City, providing color commentary and analysis for television broadcasts of Utah Jazz and University of Utah basketball games.\n\nEaton is a partner in a Salt Lake City-area restaurant named Tuscany.\n\nHe was a president/board member of the National Basketball Retired Players Association (NBRPA) from 1997 to 2007.\n\nHe founded and served as chairman of the Mark Eaton Standing Tall for Youth organization, which provided sports and outdoor activities for at-risk children in Utah. He is a motivational speaker.\n\nIn the 2013 NBA Slam Dunk Contest, Jazz player Jeremy Evans jumped over a seated Eaton to dunk the ball.\n\nIn 2014, Eaton had his high school jersey retired at Westminster High School and at Cypress College along with Swen Nater and head coach Don Johnson.\n\n\n"}

A founding member of Gush Emunim, he served as the chief rabbi of Tekoa in the West Bank. He was well known for promoting and leading interfaith dialogue between Jews and Arabs, focusing on using religion as a tool and source for recognizing the humanity and dignity of all people. His pregnant daughter-in-law was injured in a Palestinian attack on January 18, 2016. Together with a Palestinian journalist close to Hamas, Rabbi Froman drafted a ceasefire agreement between Israel and the Hamas government in the Gaza Strip, known as the Froman-Amayreh Agreement. The agreement was endorsed by Hamas government, but it did not receive any official response from the Israeli government.\n\nFroman, a former Israeli paratrooper who took part in the 1967 capture of the Western Wall, was a student at the Mercaz haRav and Yeshivat HaKotel yeshivas. He was among the founders of the Gush Emunim settlement movement, and supported the establishment of Jewish settlements in the West Bank and Gaza Strip. He obtained rabbinical ordination from Rabbis Shlomo Goren and Avraham Shapira, and then became the rabbi of Migdal Oz, a settlement in the Gush Etzion area. He was Chief Rabbi of the Knesset. He taught at several yeshivas, including Ateret Cohanim and Machon Meir, and was a lecturer at the Tekoa Yeshiva and Otniel hesder Yeshiva.\n\nRabbi Froman was involved in interfaith dialogue with Palestinians and Muslims, and participated in informal negotiations with many Palestinian leaders as he argued that peacemaking efforts between Israelis and Palestinians must include the religious sectors of both societies. Rabbi Froman conducted meetings with controversial Palestinian leaders, including with the late PLO Chairman and President of Palestinian National Authority Yasser Arafat, and the Hamas leaders Sheikh Ahmad Yassin and Mahmoud Al-Zahar. Rabbi Froman had close ties with Palestinian leaders, as evidenced by a letter he sent to Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas about his last conversation with Yasser Arafat:\nAfter the election of the Hamas government in the Gaza Strip, Rabbi Froman stepped up his efforts to organize meetings between Israeli and Palestinian religious leaders. He met and conducted negotiations with current Hamas leader Mahmoud al-Zahar and Hamas's Minister for Jerusalem Affairs, Sheikh Mahmoud Abu Tir, with the goal of drafting a ceasefire agreement that will end the killings in Gaza and the West Bank and lift the blockade imposed by Israel on the Gaza Strip.\n\nIn February 2008, Rabbi Froman reached an agreement proposal with Khaled Amayreh, a journalist close to Hamas, for an Israeli-Hamas ceasefire in the Gaza Strip that would put an immediate end to all Palestinian attacks against Israeli civilians or soldiers, facilitate the release of abducted Israeli soldier Gilad Shalit, and end the Israeli siege of the Gaza Strip. Senior Hamas officials have endorsed the agreement proposal. The Israeli government, however, has not responded to this initiative, effectively rejecting it.\n\nFroman drafted the agreement proposal with Amayreh after meeting with him over the course of several months. The paper was finalized and shown to Hamas leaders in Gaza and Hamas leader-in-exile Khaled Meshal who approved of it (see External links section). The agreement proposal was also submitted to the Israeli government but according to Rabbi Froman, the Israeli government never responded to it. The efforts of Rabbi Froman and Amayreh to meet with Israeli government officials were rebuffed.\n\nThe agreement proposal called for Israel to lift economic sanctions imposed on the Gaza Strip and open all border crossings. The cease-fire agreement included the release of abducted Israeli soldier Gilad Shalit, and a gradual release of Palestinian prisoners. The Israel Defense Forces would end \"all hostile activities toward the Gaza Strip, including targeted killings, the setting of ambushes, aerial bombardments and all penetrations into Gazan territory, in addition to ending the arrest, detention and persecution of Palestinians in the Strip.\"\n\nThe Palestinians would be obligated \"to take all the necessary steps to completely end the attacks against Israel,\" including stopping \"indefinitely all rocket attacks on Israel,\" assaults \"on Israeli civilians and soldiers\" and \"to impose a cease-fire on all groups, factions, and individuals operating in the Strip.\"\n\nAlong with Amayreh, Rabbi Froman said that even if the attempt turned out to be merely an academic exercise, its elements could be used by the Jerusalem and Gaza governments. It does not, for example, include the recognition by Hamas of the State of Israel, instead \"recognizing that there are Jews living in the Holy Land,\" according to Froman, thus overcoming an obstacle that has long been a deal-breaker.\n\nRabbi Froman lamented the early 21st century violence in Israel and the Palestinian Territories, and laid partial blame for the failure of the Oslo Accords on the tendency of Israeli and Palestinian secular negotiators to ignore and marginalize religion and religious leaders in the peace process:\nRabbi Froman supported making Jerusalem (the capital of Israel, also claimed by the Palestinians as their capital) the religious capital of all three monotheistic faiths. In November 1999, he participated in a conference with dozens of international religious leaders, including the Dalai Lama. In his 2005 letter to Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas, Froman cited examples from Jewish tradition of the importance of sharing Jerusalem between all 3 religions and turning it into a city of peace:\nRabbi Froman opposed the forced eviction of Jewish settlers from their homes in the settlements in the West Bank, and advocated that the State of Israel withdraw from the West Bank and Gaza, yet leave the settlements and Israeli/Jewish residents in place under Palestinian sovereignty. He claimed that, if Israel withdraws from Tekoa and most residents leave, he will nonetheless stay because of his love of the Land of Israel:\nHe was a strong opponent of Israel's unilateral disengagement from Gaza. In August 2005, prior to the implementation of the disengagement plan, he moved with his family to Ganei Tal in Gush Katif in order to show support for the residents being evicted.\n\nRabbi Froman supported the Palestinian Authority's efforts to attain statehood recognition at the United Nations on 20 September 2011, and said that the establishment of the Palestinian state will benefit the peace process and Israel.\n\nRabbi Froman was born in 1945 in Galilee, Mandate Palestine. He was married to educator and artist Hadassah Froman, and the couple had 10 children.\n\nUpon being diagnosed with colorectal cancer in 2010, Rabbi Froman declared that he would add \"Hai Shalom\" (living peace) to his last name and re-dedicate his life to peace and coexistence between Jews and Arabs in Israel. Despite treatment by both conventional and natural means, he died on the evening of 4 March 2013, at the age of 68. His funeral in Tekoa on 5 March 2013, lasting 4 hours, was filled with music and poetry, and was attended by thousands of people of all political and religious ideologies.\n\n"}
{"id": "1701460", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1701460", "title": "Namora", "text": "Namora\n\nNamora () is a fictional character appearing in American comic books published by Marvel Comics. She is from Atlantis and is the daughter of an Atlantean father and a human mother. She is the cousin of Namor the Sub-Mariner.\n\nNamora first appeared in the 12-pages comics \"The Coming of Namora!\" published in \"Marvel Mystery Comics\" #82 (May 1947), pencilled by Ken Bald and inked by Syd Shores. Namora also featured on the cover drawn by Bob Powell. She had her own comic book series, \"Namora\", which ran from August–December 1948. While this title lasted only three issues, she regularly appeared with Namor in \"Marvel Mystery Comics\" and also in \"Sub-Mariner\" until that series ended in the mid-1950s.\n\nThe character was not seen again for some time until her first modern appearance in the Silver Age \"Sub-Mariner\" series, in \"Sub-Mariner\" #33 (January 1971). She made an appearance in \"Marvel Feature\" #2 (March 1972), but was killed off in flashback in \"Sub-Mariner\" #50 (June 1972).\n\nOver the next 30 years, Namora appeared in a number of flashbacks and alternate reality stories, including \"What If?\" #9 (June 1978), \"The New Warriors Annual\" #1 (1991), \"What If?\" #47 (March 1993), \"The New Warriors\" #44 (February 1994), \"Avengers: Forever\" #4-5 (March–April 1999), and \"Marvel: The Lost Generation\" #3-2 (December 2000-January 2001).\n\nNamora eventually reappears, alive, in the \"Agents of Atlas\" series, in issues #1-6 (October 2006-March 2007). She also appears in \"Incredible Hulk\" #107-112 (August–December 2007), \"Giant-Size Marvel Adventures: Avengers\" #1 (September 2007), \"World War Hulk\" #2 (September 2007), \"Spider-Man Family\" #4 (October 2007), and \"Incredible Hercules\" #121-122 (November–December 2008).\n\nNamora received an entry in \"The Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe: Golden Age 2004\".\n\nShe was ranked 76th in \"Comics Buyer's Guide's\" \"100 Sexiest Women in Comics\" list.\n\nNamora is a character that originated in the Golden Age of Comic Books. Her original name was Aquaria Nautica Neptunia, but she was nicknamed \"Namora\" in honor of her cousin Namor. Like Namor, she is a hybrid mutant with superhuman strength and the power of flight by using the wings on her ankles. When her father was killed by treasure-hunting surface-dwellers, she fully changed her name to Namora, the Atlantean term for \"Avenging Daughter\", as Namor means \"Avenging Son\". She was Namor's cousin (though not by blood), and became his companion for a period of several years.\n\nNamora was ultimately shown to have been fatally poisoned by the Lemurian terrorist Llyra. She was survived by her clone, Namorita, whom she had passed off as her birth daughter because of Atlantian taboos against cloning. \"\" revealed that she had been a member of The Monster Hunters in 1956.\n\nSome time later, the Agents of Atlas find a damaged coffin, which appears to contain the mummified corpse of Namora. Upon closer inspection, Marvel Boy disables a holographic display creating the corpse image, revealing a well-preserved, alive Namora inside the coffin. When awakened, Namora joins in a fight against underwater sea creatures and displays just how powerful she is, shown to be equal in power to her cousin Namor.\nJimmy Woo offers her a spot, and Namora joins the Agents of Atlas, where she leads Venus to recover all memories of her past life as a siren, almost driving her mad in the process. It is then revealed by the enhanced bliss inducing powers of the naiad that Namora's innermost desire is to sleep with her cousin Namor.\n\nEventually the team manages to reach the Yellow Claw, revealed as the mastermind behind the Atlas Foundation, and willing to give his leading role to Jimmy Woo. Woo accepts, and Namora, as the other Agents, are employed to travel the world in Marvel Boy's spaceship to shut down any rebellious cell still pursuing criminal objectives.\n\nAt some point in her career as an Agent of Atlas she takes an extended leave, or leaves the role altogether, to join Amadeus Cho's group during the \"World War Hulk\" event.\n\nAngry over the death and subsequent vilification of her daughter at the onset of the superhero Civil War over government registration, Namora joins Amadeus Cho, Hercules and Angel to aid the Hulk. During the crisis, Hercules ends up holding the entire locality of Manhattan on his shoulders.\n\nIn the course of her membership in Cho's group, she shares a genuinely romantic kiss with Hercules. Some time later, following the Secret Invasion, Hercules and Amadeus Cho vacation near an Atlantean city, and she and Hercules have a romantic fling. This is interrupted by an Amazon attack. Namora aids Hercules in repelling the Amazons and rescuing Cho from their amorous and ultimately fatal attentions.\n\nThe Agents of Atlas decide to oppose Osborn's agenda by taking on the role of \"supervillains\", in order to form close ties to Osborn. After some time, the group becomes aware of Norman's Cabal to find out that a member of the group is none other than Namora's cousin, Namor. Upon finding this out, the Agents confront Namor for his involvement in the group. Initially at odds with each other for their recent decisions, Namora and Namor end up kissing and beginning a relationship. Namora contemplates staying with Namor until it is revealed that it was Atlantean elders that plotted for them to start a relationship and mate a long time ago as human/Atlantean hybrids are so powerful. Namor and Namora decide to part ways as they were unsure how much of their feelings for each other were genuine and how much was due to the secret plotting of the elders.\n\nDuring \"Infinity\", Namora's Atlantean School is chosen as one of the institutions set to do battle in the new Contest of Champions. However, Atlantis is attacked and decimated by the forces of Thanos before the competition can begin. Namora sends a desperate plea for help to Hank Pym, but the kingdom is destroyed before action can be taken.\n\nNamora possesses superhuman strength and can fly. She is nearly invulnerable as bullets and other missiles cannot penetrate her extremely tough skin. She can swim at superhuman speeds, breathe underwater, and is immune to the cold and pressures of the depths. She can also see better underwater than a normal human. Namora must periodically immerse herself in water to retain her powers and her health.\n\nThe second Namora first appeared in \"Exiles\" #46, and was created by Tony Bedard and Mizuki Sakakibara, and was associated with the multiversal travelers called the Exiles. She is an alternate-Earth counterpart of Namor the Sub-Mariner, rather than of Aquaria Nautica Neptunia, the Earth-616 Namora. She is a mutant with superhuman strength and the power of flight by using the ankle wings on her feet. Unlike the Marvel Universe Namor and Namora, she has the blue skin of most Atlanteans.\n\nIn Namora's universe, she became an early ally of Charles Xavier who convinced her to not attack the surface world. She would later do so, after anti-mutant hysteria led to the imprisonment of most mutants. Namora killed all of her Earth's superheroes, having the most difficulty with the Fantastic Four, and she conquered the world and ruled it for decades, before becoming 'unhinged' in time and forced to join the Exiles, much to her chagrin. Having a haughty attitude, she acted like she was superior to the other members. Still, she has shown that she did care for them, as evidenced when she thought that Hyperion had killed Morph. She lashed out at Hyperion, breaking his neck. However, it was for naught. Hyperion recovered quickly and blasted Namora with his \"flash vision\", killing her. The Exiles later sent her body back to her home reality (Earth-2189) for burial.\n\nNamora appeared in the Marvel Mangaverse series. In the story, \"Eternity Twilight\", Namora rescued Bruce Banner, who suffered temporary amnesia and have fallen for him not before Banner regained his memory involving the Hulk (a Godzilla-like beast accidentally summoned by Banner). Afterwards, Banner and Namora went back to the surface and helps Earth's heroes battle not only the Hulk, but also the demon-god Dormammu.\n\nA teenaged version of Namora appears as one of the main protagonists in the all-ages \"Marvel Her-oes\" series, which was written by Grace Randolph. She attends the same high school as Jennifer Walters and Janet van Dyne, and hides her Atlantean heritage by claiming to be an exchange student from Greece under the name of \"Namora Aquarius\".\n\nDuring the \"Ultimatum\" storyline, Thing, Invisible Woman, and Dr. Arthur Molekevic fight Doctor Dorcas alongside Namora and a Tiger Shark in Atlantis and defeat him.\n\n"}

{"id": "3994466", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=3994466", "title": "Roy Mustang", "text": "Roy Mustang\n\nBesides his appearances in the manga and the anime, Mustang has also been featured in other media for the series, such as Makoto Inoue's light novels, the original video animations and the \"Fullmetal Alchemist\" video games. Since his introduction in the manga series, Mustang has been well received by readers, appearing second in each popularity poll for the series. His character has also received praise in various outside media, with many of them focusing on his character and development in both manga and anime.\n\nRoy Mustang is introduced in \"Fullmetal Alchemist\" as a 29-year-old State Alchemist working for Amestris' State Military and as Edward Elric's superior. Outwardly arrogant and playfully manipulative, Mustang is intelligent and adaptable. At the beginning of the series, he appears as a ruthless careerist and a womanizer. However, he is known to bear strong feelings towards Riza Hawkeye, although he seldom shows it. He is also eventually shown to be a rather paternal commander who greatly cares for the emotional and physical well-being of his men, which earns him the fierce loyalty of his subordinates. This paternal nature stems from his experience in the Ishbal Civil War, where he was forced to kill using his flame alchemy, despite having learned it to help people. Angered with how he was used in the war, Mustang resolved to become the country's next leader. An extremely powerful alchemist in his own right, Mustang wears gloves made from \"ignition cloth\" with transmutation circles that create sparks or flames when he rubs his fingers together. By adjusting the oxygen densities in the surrounding atmosphere through alchemy, he can create flames anywhere in the surrounding area at will and manipulate them as he desires with \"pinpoint accuracy\". While it is often commented that Mustang is unable to produce fire with his gloves wet, he can as long as he has some way to call up flame.\n\nFollowing the death of his best friend, Lieutenant Colonel Maes Hughes, Mustang investigates the incident in secret despite the military closing the case after convicting Maria Ross. Trusting in Ross's innocence, Mustang fakes Ross's death and engineer her escape from Amestris. While breaking into a military laboratory, Mustang kills Lust, an immortal creature known as a homunculus, who was investigating his actions and was going to kill subordinates. Recovering from his wounds, Mustang learns that the Führer King Bradley is also a homunculus and tries to expose him to the top echelons of the military. This move costs Mustang and deprives him of his subordinates - Bradley places Hawkeye under his command and authorizes the transfer of Mustang's remaining personnel to the far reaches of Amestris.\n\nMustang is later contacted by General Olivier Armstrong, who is intending to join forces with various troops to attack Central City, the capital of Amestris. He then meets up with his subordinates, and the four attack Central's military while Bradley is gone. Mustang later confronts the homunculus Envy after learning that he was Hughes' true murderer; fueled by rage, Mustang easily defeats Envy. As Mustang prepares to finish Envy off, he is convinced by Hawkeye, Edward, and Scar not to kill him and allow his own thirst for vengeance to consume him. Later, the homunculi attack Mustang, forcing him to use alchemy to become the fifth human sacrifice needed for their leader. This results in Mustang losing his eyesight as part of the sacrifice, although he continues to fight with Hawkeye to help him direct his attacks. However, after the final fight is over, a former comrade, Tim Marcoh, offers to use a Philosopher's Stone to restore Mustang's eyesight on the condition that he promises that he will be a part of a movement to restore Ishbal. Mustang accepts and is put in charge of the East region as brigadier general.\n\nDuring the first anime, Mustang remains at Eastern Headquarters for the early portions of the series until he is transferred back to Central after Hughes' death. When pursuing the Elrics after the Stone's creation in Liore, Mustang learns that the Führer is a homunculus, and tries to expose him to the top brass of the military by revealing the truth about the Führer's secretary, Juliet Douglas. Although Bradley intends for him to die in combat during the Northern Campaign, Mustang instead stays in Central, making his move to avenge Hughes. Mustang then moves on to the Führer's mansion and stages his fight. Mustang is able to defeat Bradley when his son, Selim, unwittingly brings the skull of the man from which the Führer was created and weakens Bradley. As Mustang escapes the Führer's mansion, he is confronted by a maniacal Frank Archer, who shoots him. Hawkeye arrives in time to save Mustang and kills Archer.\n\nIn \"\", Mustang resigns from both alchemy and his rank to become an ordinary enlisted man in a remote outpost. However, when Central is under attack by armies and airships from a parallel universe, Mustang steps up and takes command, using his alchemy to defend Central. Mustang and his comrade Alex Louis Armstrong are able to find a hot-air balloon to reach the airships, where he is reunited with the Elric brothers, and helps them gain entry into the airship. At the end of the movie, Al says that Mustang and his team are now responsible for destroying the Amestris side of the Gate.\n\nBesides his appearances in the manga and the anime, Mustang also appears in most of the \"Fullmetal Alchemist\" original video animations, which are omake of the first anime and the film sequel. In the fourth light novel of the series written by Makoto Inoue, \"Fullmetal Alchemist: Under the Faraway Sky\", Mustang, Hughes, and Armstrong find a village populated by children while they are on holidays. In the following title, Mustang appears investigating a case involving chimeras. In video games of the series, Mustang commonly appears as a supporting character in the Elric brothers' investigation of the Philosopher's Stone. He is also featured in several cards of the \"Fullmetal Alchemist Trading Card Game\". Mustang's character is featured in the second volume of the character CDs series from \"Fullmetal Alchemist\". The CD was published on December 15, 2004 under the name of \"Hagaren Song File - Roy Mustang\". The tracks were composed by Kazuya Nishioka and performed by Toru Okawa, Mustang's Japanese voice actor in the first \"Fullmetal Alchemist\" anime. Additionally, Mustang is portrayed by Dean Fujioka in the live-action film based on the series.\n\nBefore \"Fullmetal Alchemist\" started publication, Arakawa had already thought that during the series, Mustang and his soldiers would fight against the antagonist Lust. She wanted that fight to be one of Mustang's most impressive scenes in the series, so she decided to give him calmer situations before writing such a scene. Having had only one important scene before his fight against Lust made readers of the series criticize Mustang's appearances; in order to change the readers' opinions about him before the outcome, Arakawa set up the sub-plot of how Maria Ross was accused of killing Maes Hughes and Mustang would intervene there. When King Bradley was revealed to be an antagonist, Arakawa wanted to differentiate the two characters via their treatment of their subordinates, with Mustang being unwilling to sacrifice them, unlike Bradley. Arakawa had trouble depicting this, feeling it was an important part of the series, and was unsure whether the result was good.\n\nWhen the first guidebook of the series was released, Arakawa was surprised by the large number of images featuring Mustang and supposed he was a character \"that's easy to mess with.\" Regarding Mustang's popularity within fans, Arakawa stated that while some consider him good-looking, it is still above average and that he was not too tall. While checking sketches she made before the series, Arakawa commented that most featuring Mustang are comical, with few of them showing him with a serious expression. After ending the series, Arakawa was asked by several fans if Mustang and Riza Hawkeye ever married; she replied that they could not marry as it would result in Hawkeye not being able to continue serving Mustang due to military regulations.\n\nIn the first \"Fullmetal Alchemist\" anime series, Mustang was voiced by Toru Okawa, while in the second anime, Okawa was replaced by Shin-ichiro Miki. In the English dub of the first and second anime, Mustang was voiced by Travis Willingham. Willingham first auditioned for the part of Mustang after Justin Cook said he would be just right for the role. He also auditioned for Armstrong, which was cast to Christopher Sabat. Willingham also stated that during production, he and Vic Mignogna re-recorded several parts as he was not satisfied with the result.\n\nDuring January from 2007, Oricon made a poll in which they asked Japanese fans which characters from any series they would most like to see in spin-off series. In the survey \"Men's choices\", Mustang ranked sixth. In the July 2009 issue of \"Newtype\", Mustang ranked sixth in the survey best anime male characters. In the August 2009 issue his rank changed to #8. In another \"Newtype\" poll from March 2010, Mustang was voted as the eleventh most popular male anime character from the 2000s. He has ranked highly in the \"Animage\"s Anime Grand Prix polls in the category of best male characters. His character has ranked second in all of the popularity polls from series developed by \"Monthly Shōnen Gangan\", each time being surpassed by Edward Elric. Merchandising based on Mustang's likeness has also been released, including figurines, keychains and gloves for cosplaying. Shin-ichiro Miki, Mustang's Japanese voice actor in \"\", was the winner of the fourth Seiyu Awards in the category \"Best Supporting Actor Awards\" for his role as Mustang, as well as \"Mobile Suit Gundam 00\"s Lockon Stratos. NTT customers voted him as their eleventh favorite black-haired male anime character. In a poll by Anime News Network, he was voted as the 3rd best \"guy\".\n\nPublications of manga, anime, and other media have commented on Mustang's character in both the manga and anime. While reviewing the first volume of the manga, Manga Life found that Mustang's character was more mature in the manga than in the anime. On the other hand, in the review from the first anime's last episodes, Lori Lancaster from Mania Entertainment enjoyed Mustang's relationship with Edward, comparing him to a \"teasing and protective older brother\". Sakura Eries from the same site noted that Mustang \"steals the show\" in Volume 10 of the manga, praising his fighting skills during his battle against Lust and Gluttony. Additionally, when Maria Ross was revealed in the same volume to be alive and that she was not killed by Mustang, Eries remarked on his work as leader, taking back her negative comments regarding Mustang when she thought that Mustang really killed her. These sub-plots were also commented by IGN's D. F. Smith, as they expanded Mustang's character much more than in the first anime series, where he had relatively smaller appearances. Lydia Hojnacki from PopCultureShock noted Mustang's character as one of the reasons she likes the series, noting his personality and relation with the Elric brothers. When he watched \"\", Anime News Network writer Theron Martin mentioned that when Mustang \"makes his dramatic return in a cheer-out-loud moment\", he remarked the audience \"went wild at that point\". In IGN's review of the same film, Jeremy Mullin commented that he wanted to see Mustang's counterpart from Germany, as several characters from the series had their counterparts, but then said \"it does make it fun imagining what\" he would be. David Smith from the same site cited his role and ambitions in the first anime series in the feature \"Ten Things I Learned From Fullmetal Alchemist\", which had comments on his flaws.\n\nIn an analysis of the series, Fetch Amber, a writer from Bowling Green State University, noted that while Mustang is the one that encounters Lust in the series and kills her, the fight does not mean there was a poor characterization of the homunculus' sexualization based on how different both Mustang and Lust are: while Mustang is always in one area, Lust takes a more active role in the story to the point of seeing the former as a less masculine person. While noting that Mustang is a brave man based on his actions and powers, Amber noted that there are multiple parts of the story where Mustang loses control of himself, such as when he tries to avenge the wound Jean Havok suffered in combat. A similar scene is noted in his fight against Envy where the Colonel incinerates Envy multiple times before Envy ends up killing himself, leading Amber to question whether Arakawa was reaffirming the superiority between a male and a female character based on the fact that while Envy has no gender, he is still referred as a male.\n"}

She served as an adjunct professor at the University of New Mexico teaching adaptive and digital signal, digital and microprocessor system design, and linear least-squares estimation. In 1986, she was employed as the supervisor of the Data Systems Development Organization, responsible for developing a remote controlled digital system for deployment of underground nuclear tests at the Nevada Test Site. Three years later she transferred to the Federal Aviation Administration managing the Department of Non-Destructive Test, Electromagnetic Test and Optics program on aging aircraft.\n\nBetween 1991 and 1994, David was Director of the Development Testing Center, supervising a broad spectrum of engineering test facilities. In 1995, she was appointed Deputy Director for Science and Technology of the Central Intelligence Agency and became responsible for advising the agency on science and technology. In this capacity, she proposed a radical new approach for the agency to deal with the swift growth in information with the internet revolution. Rather than procuring technology after it was developed, David and her deputy, Joanne Isham recognized and pushed for the agency to pursue partnerships within the private sector. As technology was advancing far faster than the government bureaucracy procurement program could secure new innovation, they proposed that technology be obtained at the stage of development from the private sector. She recommended utilizing technology to streamline processes and move away from simply collecting data toward a more analytical and leveraged position of disseminating and exploiting information.\n\nIn 1998, when David left the CIA, she was awarded the CIA Director's Award, the Defense Intelligence Agency Director's Award, the CIA Distinguished Intelligence Medal, the National Reconnaissance Officer's Award for Distinguished Service, and the National Security Agency Distinguished Service Medal.

St. Govan's Chapel was built in the fissure in the 14th century on what is now known as St. Govan's Head.\n\nOne story says Govan was an Irish monk who travelled to Wales late in life to seek the friends and family of the abbot who had trained him, variously identified as Saint David or Saint Ailbe of Emly. Another story identifies Govan with Gawain, one of King Arthur's Knights of the Round Table; another that he was originally a thief.\n\nGovan was set upon by pirates, from Ireland or the nearby Lundy Island. The cliff opened up and left a fissure just big enough for him to hide in until the pirates left. In gratitude, he decided to stay on along the cliff, probably to help warn the locals of the impending pirate attack if they were to return.\n\nSt Govan lived within a small cave in the fissure of the cliff. This is now reached by a long flight of stone steps, the number of which is said to vary depending on whether one is ascending or descending.\n\nThe present small vaulted chapel of local limestone was built over the cave and dates from the 13th century although the site may have been of monastic importance since the 5th century. St Govan may be identified with Sir Gwaine, one of King Arthur's knights, who entered into a state of retreat in his later years. Originally St Govan caught fish and took water from two nearby springs. Both are now dry; one was where the medieval chapel now stands, the other, which was lower down the cliff, later became a holy well. A legend says St Govan's hand prints are imprinted on the floor of his cave and his body is buried under the chapel's altar. The cave was once a popular place for making wishes.\n\nAnother legend regarding St Govan concerns his silver bell. He is supposed to have kept the bell in the tower of the chapel. When the bell pealed, its sound was of perfect tone and clarity. But pirates who heard the sound left St Govan desolate when they stole the bell. Angels flew in and took it from the pirates and returned it to the hermit. To stop the pirates returning and taking it again, the angels encased the bell in a huge stone, that is, the Bell Rock which is found at the water's edge. The legend said that when St Govan \"rang\" the stone, its vigour had become a thousand times stronger.\n\n"}

He is a double cousin of Launcelot and cousin of Launcelot's younger half-brother Ector de Maris (not to be confused with the older Sir Ector, who was King Arthur's foster-father).\n\nWhen their father dies in battle against King Claudas, Lionel and Bors are rescued by the Lady of the Lake and raised in her underwater kingdom alongside her foster-son Lancelot. Like all his family, Lionel becomes a Knight of the Round Table.\n\nWhile traveling with Lancelot as a young man, Lionel is captured by the rogue knight Turquine, who whips him with briars and throws him in the dungeon. The scenario repeats itself later while he is on the Quest for the Holy Grail, where he proves very unworthy of the blessed object by trying to kill his brother for not rescuing him. Bors had seen Lionel getting beaten and led away, but had to make a decision to save either him or a young girl being dragged in the opposite direction. He saves the girl, and fears Lionel dead. But Lionel escapes, and attacks Bors the next time they meet. Bors proves himself worthy of the Grail when he refuses to fight back, and Lionel kills a religious hermit and Sir Calogrenant, a fellow Knight of the Round Table, when they try to protect Bors from his wrath. Before Lionel can strike his brother, however, God intervenes and immobilizes him.\n\nLionel and the rest of his family follow Lancelot into exile when the affair with Queen Guinevere is exposed. Lionel participates in the battles against King Arthur and becomes King of Gaunnes. After the Battle of Camlann, Lancelot's family returns to Britain to defeat the remainder of Mordred's forces. Lionel is slain by Mordred's son Melehan; Bors avenges his death.\n\nSir Lionel is the subject of the late-medieval folk ballad \"Sir Lionel\", recorded as Child Ballad 18 and Roud #29, in which he slays a giant wild boar. This song has much in common with a medieval tale about a knight who slays a terrifyingly fiendish boar in Sidon, in the fourteenth century romance of \"Sir Eglamour of Artois\". The terrible swine is a frequent foe in romantic tales, for instance the beast Twrch Trwyth in \"Culhwch and Olwen\". The song was recorded in Appalachia as late as the early 20th century. Popular variants include \"Old Bangum\" and \"Wild Hog\".\n\n\n\n"}

The film stars Goldie Hawn and Susan Sarandon as two middle-aged women who used to be friends and groupies when they were young.\n\nIt was released on September 20, 2002. The film was Hawn's last acting role until the release of \"Snatched\" in 2017, fourteen and a half years after the release of \"The Banger Sisters\".\n\nWhen Suzette (Hawn) is fired from her job as bartender at the Whisky A Go-Go in Los Angeles, she decides, on the spur of the moment, to travel all the way to Phoenix, Arizona to see her old friend Vinnie (Sarandon). Stranded at a service station without any money to buy some gasoline, she picks up Harry Plummer (Rush), a neurotic, middle-aged author who is on his way to Phoenix to once and for all come to grips with the negative influence his father has had over his life.\n\nOn arriving in Phoenix, Suzette has a chance to meet with Vinnie's 17-year-old daughter Hannah (Erika Christensen) who, after some recreational drug use, starts throwing up in Harry's hotel room. When she drives her back to her parents' elegant suburban home Suzette at first cannot believe what she sees: Vinnie, who now calls herself Lavinia Kingsley, leads the more conservative life of the perfect wife and mother—a life which at one point prompts one of her daughters to ask Suzette, \"Did she \"ever\" do \"anything\" wrong?\" Raymond, Vinnie's lawyer husband and an aspiring politician, has no idea about his wife's past either.\n\nHowever, Suzette's sudden appearance brings back all those memories for Lavinia. Down in the basement she retrieves some of the memorabilia of their previous life as groupies, including a collection of Polaroids of the penises of numerous \"musicians and a few roadies\". She cuts her hair and throws off her expensive but boring clothes and, just for one night, relives the old days by going dancing with Suzette.

Morgan was one of about two dozen U.S. citizens to fight in the revolution and one of only three foreign nationals to hold the rank of comandante in the rebel forces. He turned against Castro after the revolution when Castro began to show Communist leanings, and was one of the leaders of the CIA supplied Escambray rebellion.\n\nMorgan was born in Cleveland, Ohio, to Alexander Morgan and German-American Loretta Morgan (née Ruderth). Raised in an affluent Toledo neighborhood, he dropped out of high school and was often in trouble with the law. Morgan joined the United States Army after World War II and married Darlene Edgerton in 1946. The marriage was annulled after a year and a half. He was stationed with Company B, 35th Infantry, in Japan, where he fathered a son with a German-Japanese hostess named Setsuko Takeda. He went AWOL, was arrested, and escaped from custody by overpowering a guard. Recaptured, he was court-martialed in 1948, received a dishonorable discharge, and spent over two years in a federal prison.\n\nHe is said to have been skilled with firearms and was rumored to have been a Central Intelligence Agency operative, though there are no public records or witness interviews to support the claim. After his discharge from the Army, Morgan apparently also worked for a local crime syndicate.\n\nOn May 11, 1954, Morgan married Ellen Theresa May Bethel, a snake charmer, in Miami. They had two children, Anne Marie (1955) and William A. Morgan Jr. (1957).\n\nOpposed to the dictatorship of Fulgencio Batista, Morgan abandoned his wife and children and went to Cuba in 1957, joining a guerrilla force of the Second National Front of the Escambray (Segundo Frente Nacional de Escambray or SFNE) that operated against Batista's soldiers in the Escambray Mountains in central Cuba.\n\nAfter distinguishing himself in a series of battles, he was promoted to the rank of comandante, leading his own column. In 1958, he wrote a statement that appeared in the \"New York Times\" to explain his participation in Castro's revolution, \"Why I Am Here\". It said in part:\nIn December 1958, Che Guevara joined forces with Morgan's group and the \"Directorio Revolucionario Estudantil\" guerrillas of the Escambray mountains. Together they captured the city of Santa Clara on December 31. Twelve hours later, Batista fled Cuba. Morgan and his men occupied the city of Cienfuegos on January 1–2, 1959.\n\nIn January 1959, he told a reporter that \"all I'm interested in is settling down to a nice peaceful existence\" but worried how U.S. authorities would respond to his military activities in Cuba. In March 1959, officials of the U.S. embassy in Havana warned Americans that participation in foreign military service could jeopardize their citizenship.\n\nIn August 1959, Morgan gained international attention when he helped smash a coup attempt orchestrated by Dominican Republic strongman Rafael Trujillo and others by pretending to lead the takeover while quietly divulging the plot to Fidel Castro in order to help the fledgling government.\n\nIn September 1959, the U.S. State Department revoked his citizenship, a move that was prompted by members of Congress who had supported Trujillo. Morgan promised to contest the action.\n\nMorgan married a Cuban, Olga María Rodríguez Farinas, also a revolutionary, they had two daughters. In August 1959, the FBI and American authorities revoked Morgan's U.S. citizenship. On September 24, 1959, Morgan renounced his U.S. citizenship publicly on a Havana radio station. After the revolution, Morgan developed a business of frog farming; with the legs being sold to restaurants, the skin for fashion accessories, and what remained for cattle feed. During this venture, Morgan would employ around 600 workers and ship an average of 50,000 pounds of frozen frog legs to the U.S. every month.\n\nOn March 6, 1960, the French freighter La Coubre exploded in Havana Harbor killing around 100 people. An American named Jack Lee Evans, who was in Cuba at the time of the explosion with Morgan, left for Miami a few days after the incident. While in Miami, he gave an interview with the \"Miami Herald\" suggesting that Morgan had been involved with the sabotaging of the ship, which Morgan adamantly denied. A memorial for the explosion was held a few days later. Morgan would be pictured arm and arm walking through the streets of Havana during this memorial with prominent Cuban leaders including Castro and Che.\n\nThroughout the struggle against Batista, Morgan was vocal about Castro's supposed anti-communist beliefs. When asked during interviews about Castro's political beliefs and where the new Cuban government was leaning, he remained firm in his belief that Castro was not a communist and that Cuba would become a capitalist parliamentary democracy.\n\nAs Castro began to reveal his socialist leanings, Morgan became disenchanted with the revolutionary government, as did other members of the SFNE, who wanted Cuba to restore elections. In the middle of June 1960, Morgan and a select few former Escambray leaders met to discuss Castro's turn towards socialism and protecting the Revolution. As the arrests of Morgan's former rebel comrades for counterrevolutionary activities started to increase, Morgan organized weapons to be smuggled to the counterrevolutionaries in the Escambray.\n\nOn October 16, 1960, Castro ordered Morgan's arrest due to counterrevolutionary activities. Three days later, Morgan was arrested while attending a meeting for the National Institute for Agrarian Reform, to which he had been summoned. Morgan was formally charged with plotting to join and lead the counter-revolutionaries who were active in the Escambray Mountains. On March 11, 1961, shortly after a military trial at La Cabana prison, Morgan, then 32 years old, was shot by firing squad with Fidel and Raul Castro in attendance. One month later, 1,500 CIA trained counterrevolutionaries would unsuccessfully invade Cuba at the Bay of Pigs resulting in Castro officially declaring the Revolution a Socialist endeavor.\n\nHis wife was tried with him \"in absentia\". She was found guilty of co-conspiracy and sentenced to 30 years in prison. She was released after 10 years. She left for the United States in 1980 during the Mariel boatlift. In a series of interviews with \"The Toledo Blade\" in 2002, she admitted that she and her husband had begun running guns to anti-Castro guerrillas because he was opposed to Castro's pro-Soviet leanings. She also said she wanted Morgan's U.S. citizenship restored and his remains returned to the United States for reburial. The newspaper stories prompted two Democratic members of the United States House of Representatives, Charles Rangel and Marcy Kaptur, to travel to Cuba in April 2002 to meet Fidel Castro and ask him to return Morgan's body, and Castro agreed.\nIn April 2007, nearly 50 years after the government stripped him of his rights in 1959 for serving in a foreign country's military, the US State Department declared that Morgan's US citizenship was effectively restored.\n\nMorgan's story remained largely out of the American eye until the 21st century when articles, documentaries, and films introduced his story. In 2012, George Clooney planned to buy the rights and direct a film based on David Grann's 2012 \"New Yorker\" article on Morgan. Pulitzer prize-winning reporters Michael Sallah and Mitch Weiss authored the book, \"The Yankee Comandante: The Untold Story of Courage, Passion and One American's Fight to Liberate Cuba.\" Morgan was featured in 2015 on the PBS documentary series \"American Experience\" with the episode titled American Comandante.\n\n\n"}
