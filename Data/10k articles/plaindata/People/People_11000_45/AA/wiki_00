{"id": "595101", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=595101", "title": "Alma the Elder", "text": "Alma the Elder\n\nAccording to the Book of Mormon, Alma () was a Nephite prophet who established the Church of Jesus Christ in the Americas during the reign of the wicked King Noah. One of the Book of Mormon's greatest figures, he is sometimes referred to as \"Alma the Elder\" as seen on the website of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints to avoid confusion with his son, also named Alma, who is often called \"Alma the Younger.\" It is believed that he was born in roughly 174 BC. and his son Alma the Younger was born in roughly 126 BC.\n\nWhile a young man, Alma was one of several corrupt priests who served King Noah in the land of Nephi. About 148 BC, a prophet named Abinadi was arrested for preaching repentance and condemning the wickedness of Noah and his people. Brought before the king and his priests, Abinadi emphatically urged them to repent and obey the gospel of Jesus Christ. Of all who heard him, only Alma was touched by Abinadi's words. When Alma began to defend Abinadi the king had Alma cast out and Abinadi burned alive. Fleeing for his life, Alma went into hiding and wrote down what Abinadi had said before the court. Alma began to preach the gospel in secret, emphasizing Abinadi's teachings \"concerning that which was to come, and also concerning the resurrection of the dead, and the redemption of the people, which was to be brought to pass through the power, and sufferings, and death of Christ, and his resurrection and ascension into heaven\" ().\n\nAt a hidden retreat in the wilderness called the waters of Mormon, Alma baptized his listeners and organized the church of Christ among them. In time, King Noah found out where Alma's congregation was meeting, and, fearing insurrection, sent his army to destroy them. Being warned by God of the army's coming, Alma quickly led his band of approximately 450 converts into the wilderness for eight days, finally stopping in an uninhabited land which they named Helam. The people of Alma established the city of Helam there and prospered for many years, remaining faithful to God's commandments.\n\nAs the years passed, Alma and his people were discovered by the Lamanites and enslaved, placed under the authority of Amulon—a former priest of King Noah now united with the Lamanites—who began to persecute Alma’s people, “put[ting] tasks upon them, and put[ting] task-masters over them” (). Finally, in about 120 BC, Alma's people escaped the Lamanites and were led by God through the wilderness for twelve days until they arrived in the land of Zarahemla, then the chief Nephite population center. The people of Alma joyfully united with the Nephites and helped to strengthen the church of Christ in Zarahemla. Zarahemla's King Mosiah soon authorized Alma to serve as the first high priest over the Church in Zarahemla. Alma continued in this capacity for many years.\n\nWhen Alma's son, Alma the Younger, and the four sons of King Mosiah came of age they rebelled against the church and \"were numbered among the unbelievers\" (). However, as they went about to destroy the church an angel appeared and, in an experience similar to that of Saul on the road to Damascus, they were all converted. Like Saul, their subsequent efforts on behalf of the church overshadowed their previous efforts to destroy the church. Shortly before his death, Alma conferred the office of high priest upon his son.\n\nThe Book of Mormon states that Alma the Elder \"lived to fulfil the commandments of God\" (). He died in about 91 BC.\n\nAlma had several notable descendants in the Book of Mormon narrative as shown in the family tree below:\n\nAt the time Joseph Smith dictated the Book of Mormon, Alma was known only as a woman's name. Recent historical research indicates it may have been a masculine name among Jewish people around 600 B.C., which is the time Lehi left Jerusalem according to the Book of Mormon.\n\nA potential Hebrew meaning of the name may be \"lad of God\" and “He [God] is bound.” Alma may possibly be traced to the Arabic root \"‘alama/’ ‘alima,\" suggesting “knowing, erudite; distinguished; chief, chieftain.\"\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "6109848", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=6109848", "title": "Augustinian nuns", "text": "Augustinian nuns\n\nAugustinian nuns are the most ancient and continuous segment of the Roman Catholic Augustinian religious order under the canons of contemporary historical method. The Augustinian nuns, named after Saint Augustine of Hippo (died AD 430), are several Roman Catholic enclosed monastic orders of women living according to a guide to religious life known as the Rule of St. Augustine. Prominent Augustinian nuns include Italian composer Vittoria Aleotti, Italian mystic St. Clare of Montefalco, German mystic Anne Catherine Emmerich and St. Rita of Cascia.\n\nThough Augustine of Hippo probably didn't compose a formal monastic rule (despite the extant Augustinian Rule), his hortatory letter to the nuns at Hippo Regius (\"Epist\"., ccxi, Benedictine ed.) is the most ancient example on which the beginnings of this Augustinian Rule are based.\n\nThe nuns regard as their first foundation the monastery for which St. Augustine wrote the rules of life in his Epistola ccxi (alias cix) in 423. It is certain that this epistle was called the Rule of St. Augustine for nuns at an early date, and has been followed as the rule of life in many female monasteries since the 11th century. These monasteries were not consolidated in 1256, like the religious communities of Augustinian monks.\nEach convent was independent and was not subject to the general of the order. This led to differences in rule, dress, and mode of life. Only since the 15th century have certain Augustinian Hermits reformed a number of Augustinian nunneries, become their spiritual directors, and induced them to adopt the Constitution of their order. Henceforth, there were female members of the Order of Hermits of St. Augustine in Italy, France, Spain, Belgium and later in Germany, where, however, many were suppressed during the Reformation, or by the secularizing law of 1803. In the other countries many nunneries were closed in consequence of the French Revolution. The still existing houses in the early 20th century, except Cascia, Renteria (Diocese of Vitoria), Eibar (Diocese of Vittoria) and Cracow, were under the jurisdiction of the bishop of the diocese. Many convents are celebrated for the saints whom they produced, such as Montefalco in Central Italy, the home of St. Clare of the Cross (or St. Clara of Montefalco, d. 1308), and Cascia, near Perugia, where St. Rita died in 1457. In the suppressed German convent of Agnetenberg near Dülmen, in Westphalia, lived Anne Catherine Emmerich celebrated for her visions.\n\nMention should also be made of the monastery of the so-called Augustinians delle Vergini, at Venice, founded in 1177 by pope Alexander III after his reconciliation with Holy Roma Emperor Frederick Barbarossa, whose daughter Julia, with twelve girls of noble birth, entered the monastery and became first abbess. Doge Sebastiano Zani, who had endowed the institution, was appointed patron, with the privilege of approving the election of the abbess before the granting of the papal confirmation. On the French occupation in the 18th century the religious went to America, where they devoted themselves to the work of teaching and the care of the sick. Later they established monasteries in Italy and in 1817 in Paris. Towards the end of the 16th century communities of female Discalced Augustinians appeared in Spain. The first convent, that of the Visitation, was founded at Madrid, in 1589, by Prudencia Grillo, a lady of noble birth, and received its Constitution from Father Alfonso of Orozco. Juan de Ribera, Archbishop of Valencia (d. 1611), founded a second Discalced Augustinian congregation at Alcoy, in 1597. It soon had houses in different parts of Spain, and in 1663 was established at Lisbon by Queen Louise of Portugal. In addition to the Rule of St. Augustine these religious observed the exercises of the Reformed Carmelites of St. Teresa. In the convent at Cybar, Mariana Manzanedo of St. Joseph instituted a reform which led to the establishment of a third, that of the female Augustinian Recollects. The statutes, drawn up by Father Antinólez, and later confirmed by Paul V, bound the sisters to the strictest interpretation of the rules of poverty and obedience, and a rigorous penitential discipline. All three reforms spread in Spain and Portugal, but not in other countries.\n\nA congregation of Augustinian nuns under the title \"Sisters of St. Ignatius\" was introduced into the Philippines and South America by the Discalced Augustinian Hermits. They worked zealously in aid of the missions, schools and orphanages in the island, and founded the colleges of Our Lady of Consolation and of St. Anne at Manila, and houses at Neuva Segovia, Cebú and Mandaloya on the Pasig, where they have done much for the education of girls.\n\nHistorically, the most important of the observant Augustinian congregations were the Spanish Augustinian tertiary nuns, founded in 1545 by Archbishop Thomas of Villanova at Valencia; the \"reformed\" Augustinian nuns who originated under the influence of Augustinian educated Carmelite St Theresa after the end of the 16th century at Madrid, Alcoy, and those founded in Portugal.\n\nThe teaching and writing of Augustine, the Augustinian Rule, and the lives and experiences of Augustinians over sixteen centuries help define the ethos of the order, sometimes \"honoured in the breach\".\n\nAs well as telling his disciples to be \"of one mind and heart on the way towards God\" Augustine of Hippo taught that \"Nothing conquers except truth and the victory of truth is love\" (\"Victoria veritatis est caritas\"), and the pursuit of truth through learning is key to the Augustinian ethos, balanced by the injunction to behave with love towards one another. It does not unduly single out the exceptional, especially favour the gifted, nor exclude the poor or marginalised. Love is not earned through human merit, but received and given freely by God's free gift of grace, totally undeserved yet generously given. These same imperatives of affection and fairness have driven the order in its international missionary outreach. This balanced pursuit of love and learning has energised the various branches of the order into building communities founded on mutual affection and intellectual advancement. The Augustinian ideal is inclusive.\n\nAugustine spoke passionately of God's \"beauty so ancient and so new\", and his fascination with beauty extended to music. He taught that \"to sing once is to pray twice\" (\"Qui cantat, bis orat\"), and music is also a key part of the Augustinian ethos. Besides the significant musical contribution of Augustinian nun and composer Vittoria Aleotti, contemporary Augustinian musical foundations include the famous Augustinerkirche of the (male) friars in Vienna, where orchestral masses by Mozart and Schubert are performed every week, as well as the boys' choir at Sankt Florian in Austria, a school conducted by Canons Regular, a choir now over 1,000 years old.\n\nOther orders and groups of women that are not enclosed and belong within the Augustinian family either because they follow the Rule of Augustine or have been formally aggregated through their constitutions into the worldwide Augustinian Order are: \nThe Sisters of St Rita, The Augustinian Sisters of Mercy of Jesus (South Africa), the Augustinian Recollects and the Sisters of Our Lady of Consolation (both in the Philippines), the Congregation of Our Lady of the Missions, the Sisters of Charity of the Incarnate Word (who established the University of the Incarnate Word in Texas), and the Sisters of St Joan of Arc (in Quebec, United States, and Rome) are just some of the Augustinian family of orders who are not enclosed women. The Sisters of Life are a relatively new order (founded 1991 by Cardinal O'Connor) who follow the Augustinian rule.\n\nThere are other Augustinian nuns in the Anglican Communion.\n\n\n\n\n"}

She was convicted of horse theft in 1883. She was fatally shot in 1889 in a case that is still officially unsolved. Her story was popularized by Richard K. Fox—editor and publisher of the \"National Police Gazette\"—and she later became a popular character in television and movies.\n\nBelle Starr was born Myra Maybelle Shirley on her father's farm near Carthage, Missouri, on February 5, 1848. Most of her family members called her May. Her father, John Shirley, prospered raising wheat, corn, hogs and horses, though he was considered to be the \"black sheep\" of a well-to-do Virginia family which had moved west to Indiana, where he married and divorced twice. Her mother, Elizabeth \"Eliza\" Hatfield Shirley, was John Shirley's third wife and a distant relative to the Hatfields of the famous family feud. In the 1860s, her father sold the farm and moved the family to Carthage, where he bought an inn, livery stable and blacksmith shop on the town square.\n\nMay Shirley received a classical education and learned piano, while graduating from Missouri's Carthage Female Academy, a private institution that her father had helped to found.\n\nAfter a Union attack on Carthage in 1864, the Shirleys moved to Scyene, Texas. According to legend, it was at Scyene that the Shirleys became associated with a number of Missouri-born criminals, including Jesse James and the Youngers. In fact, she knew the Younger brothers and the James boys because she had grown up with them in Missouri. Her brother, John A. M. \"Bud\" Shirley, was called Captain Shirley by local Confederate sympathizers. He does not appear on any list of Quantrill's Raiders, but rode with a group who were called partisans by some and bushwackers by Union sympathizers. Bud Shirley was killed in 1864 in Sarcoxie, Missouri, while he and another scout were eating at the home of a Confederate sympathizer. Union troops surrounded the house and when Bud attempted to escape, he was shot and killed.\n\nFollowing the war, the Reed family also moved to Scyene and May Shirley married Jim Reed in 1866, after having had an earlier crush on him as a teen. Two years later, she gave birth to her first child, Rosie Lee (nicknamed Pearl). Belle always harbored a strong sense of style, which would feed into her later legend. A crack shot, she used to ride sidesaddle while dressed in a black velvet riding habit and a plumed hat, carrying two pistols, with cartridge belts across her hips. Jim turned to crime and was wanted for murder in Arkansas, which caused the family to move to California, where their second child, James Edwin (Eddie), was born in 1871.\n\nLater returning to Texas, Jim Reed was involved with several criminal gangs. While Jim initially tried his hand at farming, he would grow restless and fell in with bad company—the Starr clan, a Cherokee Indian family notorious for whiskey, cattle, and horse thievery in the Indian Territory (now Oklahoma), as well as his wife's old friends the James and Younger gangs. In April 1874, despite a lack of any evidence, a warrant was issued for her arrest for a stagecoach robbery by her husband and others. Jim Reed was killed in August of that year in Paris, Texas, where he had settled down with his family.\n\nAllegedly, Belle was briefly married for three weeks to Charles Younger, uncle of Cole Younger in 1878, but this is not substantiated by any evidence. There are numerous claims that Belle's daughter Pearl Reed was actually Pearl Younger, but in Cole Younger's own biography (quoted in Glen Shirley's \"Belle Starr and her times\") Cole Younger discounted that as rubbish and set down what he truly knew of Belle. In 1880 she did marry a Cherokee man named Sam Starr and settled with the Starr family in the Indian Territory. There, she learned ways of organizing, planning and fencing for the rustlers, horse thieves and bootleggers, as well as harboring them from the law. Belle's illegal enterprises proved lucrative enough for her to employ bribery to free her cohorts from the law whenever they were caught.\n\nIn 1883, Belle and Sam were arrested by Bass Reeves charged with horse theft and tried before \"The Hanging Judge\" Isaac Parker's Federal District Court in Fort Smith, Arkansas; the prosecutor was United States Attorney W. H. H. Clayton. She was found guilty and served nine months at the Detroit House of Corrections in Detroit, Michigan. Belle proved to be a model prisoner and during her time in jail she won the respect of the prison matron, while Sam was more incorrigible and was assigned to hard labor.\n\nIn 1886, she escaped conviction on another theft charge, but on December 17, Sam Starr was involved in a gunfight with Officer Frank West. Both men were killed, while Belle's life as an outlaw queen—and what had been the happiest relationship of her life—abruptly ended with her husband's death.\n\nFor the last two-plus years of her life, gossips and scandal sheets linked her to a series of men with colorful names, including Jack Spaniard, Jim French and Blue Duck, after which, in order to keep her residence on Indian land, she married a relative of Sam Starr, Jim July Starr, who was some 15 years younger than she was.\n\nOn February 3, 1889, two days before her 41st birthday, she was killed. She was riding home from a neighbor's house in Eufaula, Oklahoma, when she was ambushed. After she fell off her horse, she was shot again to make sure she was dead. Her death resulted from shotgun wounds to the back and neck and in the shoulder and face. Legend says she was shot with her own double barrel shotgun.\n\nAccording to Frank \"Pistol Pete\" Eaton, her death was due to different circumstances. She had been attending a dance. Frank Eaton had been the last person to dance with Belle Starr when Edgar Watson, clearly intoxicated had asked to dance with her. When Belle Starr declined, he later followed her. When on the way home, she stopped to give her horse a drink at a creek, he shot and killed her. According to Frank Eaton, Watson was tried, convicted and executed by hanging for the murder.\n\nHowever, another story says there were no witnesses and no one was ever convicted of the murder. Suspects with apparent motive included her new husband and both of her children, as well as Edgar J. Watson, one of her sharecroppers, because he was afraid she was going to turn him in to the authorities as an escaped murderer from Florida with a price on his head. Watson, who was killed in 1910, was tried for her murder, but was acquitted, and the ambush has entered Western lore as \"unsolved\".\n\nOne source suggests her son, whom she had allegedly beaten for mistreating her horse, may have been her killer.\n\nAlthough an obscure figure outside Texas throughout most of her life, Belle's story was picked up by the dime novel and \"National Police Gazette\" publisher, Richard K. Fox. Fox made her name famous with his novel \"Bella Starr, the Bandit Queen, or the Female Jesse James\", published in 1889 (the year of her murder). This novel is still often cited as a historical reference. It was the first of many popular stories that used her name.\n\nBelle's son, Eddie Reed, was convicted of horse theft and receiving stolen property in July 1889. Judge Parker sent him to prison in Columbus, Ohio. Belle's daughter, Rosie Reed, also known as Pearl Starr, became a prostitute to raise funds for Eddie's release. She did eventually obtain a presidential pardon in 1893. Ironically, Eddie became a deputy in Fort Smith and killed two outlaw brothers named Crittenden in 1895, and was himself killed in a saloon in Claremore, Oklahoma on December 14, 1896.\n\nPearl operated several bordellos in Van Buren and Fort Smith, Arkansas, from the 1890s to World War I.\n\n\n\"Belle Starr In Velvet\" by Kenneth D.

{"id": "56359661", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=56359661", "title": "Cheeki Rafiki", "text": "Cheeki Rafiki\n\nCheeki Rafiki was a Bénéteau First 40.7 sailing yacht. Her sinking on May 16, 2014 resulted in an extended debate over the safety of modern sailing boats. The yacht lost her keel about 720 nautical miles Southeast of Nova Scotia and subsequently capsized. Rescue services found her upturned hull before it sank but the crew – four English men – was never found.\n\n\"Cheeki Rafiki\" was a Bénéteau First 40.7, which had been built 2006 in Bénéteau's shipyard in Saint-Hilaire-de-Riez, France. She was about 12 meters long. She had been delivered to the customer in December 2006, who planned to enter her in charter regattas around Great Britain. In 2011, Stormforce Coaching took over the management of the yacht, but not her ownership. Subsequently, they entered the yacht twice for the Atlantic Rally for Cruisers (ARC), in the autumns of 2011 and 2013. After each of these crossings, she stayed in the Caribbean Sea for a few months. The tragedy happened during the journey home in early 2014. \n\nCentral to the later investigation was the construction of the hull and especially the link between the hull and the so-called \"matrix\", an inner layer that was embedded in the lower part of the hull to give it the necessary stability and stiffness. The keel was secured to the hull by ten bolts; nine of them 24mm in diameter and one 14mm. They were laminated into the keel, and put through the outer hull, the matrix, and a steel washer, and then secured with nuts. The building process and the construction fulfilled the CE-seaworthiness Classification of category A (ocean), in the version valid at the time of building. Additionally, the construction process had been surveyed by Bureau Veritas.\n\n\"Cheeki Rafiki\" had participated in the Antigua Sailing Week event in spring 2014 and was supposed to return to Southampton, England afterwards, to be available as charter yacht the following season. She left Antigua on May, 4 with a crew of four men on board. The voyage was expected to take about 30 days. During the voyage, the skipper exchanged E-Mails with the director of Stormforce over satellite phone, especially about route suggestions and weather reports. Initially, there was not much wind, but it was constantly increasing after May 10. On May 16, the wind blew with Force 7 and a considerable sea had built up. The skipper reported to shore that the ship was taking on significant amounts of water for no apparent reason. A later phone call was incomprehensible, such that the director called MRCC Falmouth for help. A search-and-rescue operation was started. RCC Boston, responsible for the area in question, sent out a HC-130 Long Range Surveillance Aircraft. They were looking for a disabled yacht and persons in the water, since two PLB devices had sent emergency signals. The aircraft crew identified only debris at the expected position. \n\nOn May 17, more than 24 hours after the last contact with the ship, the container vessel \"Maersk Kure\" identified \"Cheeki Rafiki\"s hull, upside-down. The keel was missing, but the rudder was still in place. Due to bad weather conditions, the wreck could not be investigated further. Only about one week later could a ship of the US Navy send a diver to the still-floating wreck. This confirmed the life raft was still secured to its storage location; the crew had not had the time to bring it out. Consequently, the search was terminated, because any hope of finding the crew alive was in vain. The maximum time somebody can survive in water of 16 °C is about 15.5 hours.\n\nThe accident resulted in heated discussion amongst yachtsmen over the safety of sailboats and particularly over the construction and dimensioning of the connection between keel and hull, which had obviously failed in this case, but is of utmost importance for a sailing vessel. There were speculations whether the shipyard had fallen below the margins for required hull stability to cut costs as a measure to win customers in the highly competitive market for affordable yachts. The report of the British Marine Accident Investigation Branch showed that the construction did satisfy the relevant construction specifications available at the time of construction. It even almost passed the revised ones at the time of the accident. Therefore, the shipyard could not be held liable for the lack of stability. \n\nFurthermore, the crew could also not be blamed for the accident, because they were competent and the skipper was in the possession of all required certificates for such a voyage. At the time of the accident, the wind blew with force 7, which is rough but still completely within the limits for which such boats are constructed. The accident investigation report points out though, that it's unclear whether the ship was even allowed to set to sea under applicable laws. This because, as a professionally skippered boat, there are extensive rules concerning equipment, crewing and yearly safety inspections. The later was overdue, but the operator was intending to postpone the inspection until the boat was back in England, so that he could avoid the costs of having to fly an inspector to the Caribbean. \nThe investigation report then tries to evaluate why the keel actually separated, even though technically, computationally and based on the weather at the place of incident there was no obvious reason for this. The wreck of the \"Cheeki Rafiki\" was not available for investigation, as it has not been found yet. So the MAIB had to find their conclusions from the few pictures of the rescue crews, the history of the boat and reports from sister ships. It was known that she had had a few groundings prior to the accident – experts investigated by the MAIB said that this was not uncommon for ships participating in races. The connection between hull, matrix and keel had been repaired several times already. Even experts are not normally capable of telling how such a repair would be properly done and how to tell that it was acceptably fixed. The recommendation from the manufacturer to remove the keel completely was considered best practice, its cost-effectiveness was questioned though.\n\nThe report concludes that the most probable cause for the accident was a failure of the glued link between the \"matrix\" (inner skeleton) and the outer hull. Similar damages could be observed in sister ships which where involved in groundings, too. Different repair yards said that they could only hardly determine the severity of such damages. Also, a skipper cannot easily determine whether a \"light\" grounding had caused any damage. The report states that \"Almost all [yacht owners and professional yacht skippers asked] agreed that groundings can occur when racing, and that if, in their opinion, it was a ‘light’ grounding, no inspection for damage was necessary\", while at the same time, there are several definitions for a \"light grounding\":\n\nIt is assumed that the structural damages in the hull of \"Cheeki Rafiki\" had not been sufficiently repaired after the previous groundings, such that the stability of the glued hull was compromised. It couldn't withstand the force of the increasing waves. The pictures show that the layers of the hull had separated. Some bolts could also have failed due to corrosion. \n\nThe extensive report gives many recommendations for improvements. However, it does not ask for increased stability requirements for keel-to-hull constructions.\n\nShortly after the report was published operating company Stormforce and its director Douglas Innes were charged, with Innes facing four counts of manslaughter by gross negligence. He was accused of insufficient maintenance to cut costs. The yacht was, according to the Crown Prosecution Service, not seaworthy for an ocean passage, as several bolts of the keel were corroded or broken even before the voyage: \"A number of keel bolts had broken, causing it to detach from the hull. Many were broken and it had been like that for months. The yacht was therefore unsound, broken, and unsafe before the men left from Antigua.\" Innes pleaded not guilty.\n\nThe jury at Winchester Crown Court acquitted Innes of manslaughter, but they did find him and the company guilty of unsafe operation of the vessel and of failing to fulfill the requirements of the Merchant Shipping Act. On May 11, 2018 Innes received a suspended sentence whilst his bankrupt firm Stormforce was fined £50,000.\n\n"}
{"id": "305865", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=305865", "title": "Chesley Bonestell", "text": "Chesley Bonestell\n\nChesley Knight Bonestell, Jr. (January 1, 1888 – June 11, 1986) was an American painter, designer and illustrator. His paintings were a major influence on science fiction art and illustration, and he helped inspire the American space program. An pioneering creator of astronomical art, along with the French astronomer-artist Lucien Rudaux, Bonestell was dubbed the \"Father of Modern Space art\".\n\nBonestell was born in San Francisco, California. His first astronomical painting was done in 1905. After seeing Saturn through the telescope at San Jose's Lick Observatory, he rushed home to paint what he had seen. The painting was destroyed in the fire that followed the 1906 earthquake. Between 1915 and 1918 he exhibited lithographs in the 4th and 7th annual exhibitions of the California Society of Etchers (now the California Society of Printmakers) in San Francisco.\n\nBonestell studied architecture at Columbia University in New York City. Dropping out in his third year, he worked as a renderer and designer for several of the leading architectural firms of the time. While with William van Alen, he and Warren Straton designed the art deco façade of the Chrysler Building as well as its distinctive eagles. During this same period, he designed the Plymouth Rock Memorial, the U.S. Supreme Court Building, the New York Central Building, Manhattan office and apartment buildings and several state capitols.\n\nReturning to the West Coast, he prepared illustrations of the chief engineer's plans for the Golden Gate Bridge for the benefit of funders. When the Great Depression dried up architectural work in the United States, Bonestell went to England, where he rendered architectural subjects for the \"Illustrated London News\". In the late 1930s he moved to Hollywood, where he worked (without screen credit) as a special effects artist, creating matte paintings for films, including \"The Hunchback of Notre Dame\" (1939), \"Citizen Kane\" (1941) and \"The Magnificent Ambersons\" (1942).\n\nBonestell then realized that he could combine what he had learned about camera angles, miniature modeling, and painting techniques with his lifelong interest in astronomy. The result was a series of paintings of Saturn as seen from several of its moons that was published in \"Life\" in 1944. Nothing like these had ever been seen before: they looked as though photographers had been sent into space. His painting of Saturn seen from the frosty moon Titan is perhaps the most famous astronomical landscape ever. It was constructed with a combination of clay models, photographic tricks and various painting techniques. (Titan has a thick haze; such a view is probably not possible in reality.)\n\nBonestell followed up the sensation these paintings created by publishing more paintings in many leading national magazines. These and others were eventually collected in the best-selling book \"The Conquest of Space\" (1949), produced in collaboration with author Willy Ley. Bonestell's last work in Hollywood was contributing special effects art and technical advice to the seminal science fiction films produced by George Pal, including \"Destination Moon\", \"When Worlds Collide\", \"The War of the Worlds\" and \"Conquest of Space\", as well as \"Cat-Women of the Moon\". Beginning with the October 1947 issue of \"Astounding Science Fiction\", Bonestell painted more than 60 cover illustrations for science fiction magazines, primarily \"The Magazine of Fantasy & Science Fiction\", in the 1950s through 1970s. He also illustrated many book covers.\n\nWhen Wernher von Braun organized a space flight symposium for \"Collier's\", he invited Bonestell to illustrate his concepts for the future of spaceflight. For the first time, spaceflight was shown to be a matter of the near future. Von Braun and Bonestell showed that it could be accomplished with the technology then existing in the mid-1950s, and that the question was that of money and will. Coming as they did at the beginning of the Cold War and just before the sobering shock of the launch of Sputnik, the 1952–54 \"Collier's\" series, \"Man Will Conquer Space Soon!\", was instrumental in kick-starting America's space program.\n\nIn 1986, Bonestell died in Carmel, California, with an unfinished painting on his easel.\n\nDuring his lifetime, Bonestell was honored internationally for the contributions he made to the birth of modern astronautics, from a bronze medal awarded by the British Interplanetary Society to a place in the International Space Hall of Fame to an asteroid named for him. \"The Conquest of Space\" won the 1951 International Fantasy Award for nonfiction, one of the first two fantasy or science fiction awards anywhere, at the British SF Convention. The Science Fiction Hall of Fame inducted Bonestell in 2005, the first year it considered non-literary contributors.\n\nHis paintings are prized by collectors and institutions such as the National Air and Space Museum and the National Collection of Fine Arts. One of his classic paintings, an ethereally beautiful image of Saturn seen from its giant moon Titan, has been called \"the painting that launched a thousand careers.\" Wernher von Braun wrote that he had \"learned to respect, nay fear, this wonderful artist's obsession with perfection. My file cabinet is filled with sketches of rocket ships I had prepared to help in his artwork—only to have them returned to me with…blistering criticism.\"\n\nA crater on Mars and the asteroid 3129 Bonestell are named after him.\n\nIn 2016 the first ever album of Sun Ra vocal tracks was released, \"The Space Age Is Here To Stay,\" featuring sleeve art authorized by the Bonestell estate.\n\n\n\nBonestell appeared in the documentary The Fantasy Film Worlds of George Pal (1985) (Produced and directed by Arnold Leibovit).\n\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "49650", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=49650", "title": "Dan Aykroyd", "text": "Dan Aykroyd\n\nDaniel Edward Aykroyd (born July 1, 1952) is a Canadian-American actor, comedian, musician, businessman and filmmaker. He was an original member of the \"Not Ready for Prime Time Players\" on \"Saturday Night Live\" (1975–79). A musical sketch he performed with John Belushi on \"SNL\", The Blues Brothers, turned into an actual performing band and then the 1980 film \"The Blues Brothers\".\n\nHe conceived and starred in \"Ghostbusters\" (1984), which spawned a sequel and eventually an entire media franchise. In 1990, he was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor for his work in the 1989 film \"Driving Miss Daisy\". He starred in his own sitcom, \"Soul Man\" (1997–98). Aykroyd is also a businessman, having co-founded the House of Blues chain of music venues and the Crystal Head Vodka brand.\n\nAykroyd was born on Dominion Day (July 1, which is now called Canada Day), 1952 at The Ottawa Hospital in Ottawa, Ontario, Canada. He grew up in Ottawa, Canada's capital, where his father, Samuel Cuthbert Peter Hugh Aykroyd, a civil engineer, worked as a policy adviser to Canadian Prime Minister Pierre Trudeau. His mother, Lorraine Hélène (née Gougeon), was a secretary. His mother was of French Canadian descent and his father is of English, Irish, Scottish, Dutch, and French ancestry. His brother, Peter, is also an actor.\n\nAykroyd was born with syndactyly, or webbed toes, which was revealed in the film \"Mr. Mike's Mondo Video\" and in a short film on \"Saturday Night Live\" titled \"Don't Look Back In Anger\". Aykroyd was raised in the Catholic Church, and until age 17 he intended to become a priest. He attended St. Pius X and St. Patrick's high schools, and studied criminology and sociology at Carleton University, but dropped out before completing his degree. He worked as a comedian in various Canadian nightclubs and ran an after-hours speakeasy, Club 505, in Toronto for several years.\n\nAykroyd developed his musical career in Ottawa, particularly through his regular attendances at The Owl, a club that featured many blues artists. He describes these influences as follows:\n\n...there was a little disco club there called Le Hibou, which in French means 'the owl.' And it was run by a gentleman named Harvey Glatt, and he brought every, and I mean every, blues star that you or I would ever have wanted to have seen through Ottawa in the late '50s, well I guess more late '60s sort of, in around the Newport jazz rediscovery. I was going to Le Hibou and hearing James Cotton, Otis Spann, Pinetop Perkins, and Muddy Waters. I actually jammed behind Muddy Waters. S.P. Leary left the drum kit one night, and Muddy said 'anybody out there play drums? I don't have a drummer.' And I walked on stage and we started, I don't know, Little Red Rooster, something. He said 'keep that beat going, you make Muddy feel good.' And I heard Howlin' Wolf (Chester Burnett). Many, many times I saw Howlin' Wolf. As well as The Doors. And of course Buddy Guy, Buddy Guy and Junior Wells, Sonny Terry and Brownie McGhee. So I was exposed to all of these players, playing there as part of this scene to service the academic community in Ottawa, a very well-educated community. Had I lived in a different town I don't think that this would have happened, because it was just the confluence of educated government workers, and then also all the colleges in the area, Ottawa University, Carleton, and all the schools—these people were interested in blues culture.\n\nAykroyd's first professional experience, which he gained at the age of 17, was as a member of the cast of the short-lived Canadian sketch comedy series \"The Hart and Lorne Terrific Hour\" with Lorne Michaels, among others. He was a member of the Second City comedy troupe in 1973 in both Toronto and Chicago.\n\nAykroyd gained fame on the American late-night comedy show \"Saturday Night Live\". He was originally hired, and paid $278 a week, as a writer for the show, but became a part of the cast before the series premiered. The original cast was referred to on the show as \"The Not Ready For Prime Time Players\". Aykroyd was the youngest member of the cast, and appeared on the show for its first four seasons, from 1975–79. He brought a unique sensibility to the show, combining youth, unusual interests, talent as an impersonator, and an almost lunatic intensity. Guest host Eric Idle of Monty Python said that Aykroyd's ability to write and act out characters flawlessly made him the only member of the \"SNL\" cast capable of being a Python.\n\nHe was known for his impersonations of celebrities like Jimmy Carter, Vincent Price, Richard Nixon, Rod Serling, Tom Snyder, Julia Child, and others. He was also known for his recurring roles, such as Beldar, father of the Coneheads family; with Steve Martin, Yortuk Festrunk, one of the \"Two Wild and Crazy Guys\" Czech brothers; sleazy late-night cable TV host E. Buzz Miller and his cousin, corrupt maker of children's toys and costumes Irwin Mainway (who extolled the virtues and defended the safety of the \"Bag-o-Glass\" toy, perhaps the retail leader of the \"Bag-o\" series of toys); Fred Garvin – male prostitute; and high-bred but low-brow critic Leonard Pinth-Garnell. He also co-hosted the Weekend Update segment for one season with Jane Curtin, known particularly for their point-counterpoint debates enlivened with vicious personal insults including his catchphrase \"Jane, you ignorant slut\".\n\nAykroyd's eccentric talent was recognized by others in the highly competitive \"SNL\" environment: when he first presented his famous \"Super Bass-O-Matic '76\" sketch, a fake T.V. commercial in which a garish, hyper-pitchman touts a food blender that turns an entire bass into liquid pulp, \"to [other writers and cast members] the 'Bass-O-Matic' was so exhilaratingly strange that many remember sitting and listening, open-mouthed ... Nobody felt jealous of it because they couldn't imagine writing anything remotely like it.\" While Aykroyd was a close friend and partner with fellow cast member John Belushi and shared some of the same sensibilities, Aykroyd was more reserved and less self-destructive. Aykroyd later recalled that, unlike Belushi and other of his peers, he was uninterested in recreational drug use.\n\nIn 1977, he received an Emmy Award for writing on \"SNL\"; he later received two more nominations for writing and one for acting. In \"Rolling Stone\"s February 2015 appraisal of all 141 \"Saturday night live\" cast members to date, Aykroyd was ranked fifth (behind Belushi, Eddie Murphy, Tina Fey, and Mike Myers). \"Of all the original [\"SNL\"] greats, Aykroyd is the least imitated\", they wrote, \"because nobody else can do what he did.\"\n\nIn later decades, Aykroyd made occasional guest appearances and unannounced cameos on \"SNL\", often impersonating the American politician Bob Dole. He would also bring back past characters including Irwin Mainway and Leonard Pinth-Garnell.\n\nDuring some guest appearances he resurrected The Blues Brothers musical act with frequent host John Goodman in place of Belushi. He became the second member of the original cast to host \"SNL\" in May 2003 when he appeared in the season finale. During his monologue, he performed a musical number with James Belushi similar to the Blues Brothers, but neither Aykroyd nor Belushi donned the famous black suit and sunglasses. On March 24, 2007, Aykroyd appeared as a crying fan of \"American Idol\" finalist Sanjaya Malakar (played by Andy Samberg) during Weekend Update. On February 14, 2009, he appeared as U.S. House Minority leader John Boehner. Aykroyd also made a surprise guest appearance, along with many other \"SNL\" alumni, on the show of March 9, 2013.\n\nAykroyd was a close friend of John Belushi. According to Aykroyd, it was their first meeting that helped spark the Blues Brothers act. When they met in a club Aykroyd frequented, he played a blues record in the background, and it stimulated a fascination with blues in Belushi, who was primarily a fan of heavy rock bands at the time. Aykroyd educated Belushi on the finer points of blues music and, with a little encouragement from then-\"SNL\" music director Paul Shaffer, it led to the creation of their Blues Brothers characters.\n\nBacked by such experienced professional R&B sidemen as lead guitarist Steve Cropper, sax man Lou Marini, trumpeter Alan Rubin, and bass guitarist Donald \"Duck\" Dunn, the Blues Brothers proved more than an \"SNL\" novelty. Taking off with the public as a legitimate musical act, they performed live gigs and in 1978 released the hit album \"Briefcase Full of Blues\" (drawn from the fact that Aykroyd, as \"Elwood Blues\", carried his blues harmonicas in a briefcase that he kept handcuffed to his wrist, in the manner of a CIA courier; Belushi originally carried the key to those handcuffs). \"Briefcase Full of Blues\" eventually sold 3.5 million copies, and is one of the highest-selling blues albums of all time. The band was much further popularized in the 1980 film \"The Blues Brothers\", which Aykroyd co-wrote.\n\nEarly in the incarnation of the Blues Brothers, Belushi joined the Grateful Dead on stage on April 2, 1980, for a rendition of \"Good Morning Little School Girl\" at the Capitol Theatre in Passaic, New Jersey that coincided with the Dead's appearance on \"SNL\" that weekend. Belushi sang the part usually carried by the late band member Ron \"Pigpen\" McKernan.\n\nCherokee Studios in Los Angeles was a regular haunt for the original Blues Brothers in the early days of the band. Belushi and Aykroyd became fixtures at the recording studio, while fellow Blues Brother Steve Cropper called Cherokee his producing home. Whenever they needed a bass player, they were joined by another Blues Brother, Donald \"Duck\" Dunn. During this time, Cropper, along with producing partner and Cherokee owner Bruce Robb, worked on a number of music projects with the two comedians/musicians, including Belushi's favorite band, Fear, and later Aykroyd's movie \"Dragnet\".\n\nThe Blues Brothers Band continues to tour today, both with and without Aykroyd. The band features original members Cropper and Marini, along with vocalist Eddie Floyd. Aykroyd sometimes performs as Elwood, along with Belushi's younger brother Jim Belushi, who plays \"Brother Zee\" on stage. They are most frequently backed by The Sacred Hearts Band.\n\nConcurrent with his work in \"Saturday Night Live\", Aykroyd played the role of Purvis Bickle, lift operator at the fictitious office block 99 Sumach Street in the CBC Television series \"Coming Up Rosie\".\n\nAfter leaving \"Saturday Night Live\", Aykroyd starred in a number of films, mostly comedies, with uneven results both commercially and artistically. His first three American feature films all co-starred Belushi. The first, \"1941\" (1979), directed by Steven Spielberg, was a box office disappointment. The second, \"The Blues Brothers\" (1980), which he co-wrote with director John Landis, was a massive hit. The third, \"Neighbors\" (1981) had mixed critical reaction but was another box-office hit. One of his best-received performances was as a blueblood-turned-wretch in the 1983 comedy \"Trading Places\", in which he co-starred with fellow \"SNL\" alumnus Eddie Murphy as well as Jamie Lee Curtis.\n\nIn the early 1980s, Aykroyd began work on a script for the film that eventually became \"Ghostbusters\", inspired by his fascination with parapsychology. The script initially included a much greater fantasy element, including time travel, but this was toned down substantially through work on the script with Harold Ramis (who became a co-writer) and director Ivan Reitman. Aykroyd originally wrote the role of Dr. Peter Venkman with Belushi in mind, but rewrote it for Bill Murray after Belushi's death. Aykroyd joked that the green ghost, later known as \"Slimer\", was \"the ghost of John Belushi\" and was based on Belushi's party animal personality. \"Ghostbusters\" was released in 1984 and became a huge success for Aykroyd, who also appeared as one of the lead actors; the film earned nearly on a budget.\n\nAykroyd's next major film role was in the 1985 spy comedy film \"Spies Like Us\", which like \"The Blues Brothers\" was co-conceived and co-written by Aykroyd, and directed by Landis. Aykroyd had again intended for Belushi to be the other lead in the film; the part was instead given to \"SNL\" alumnus Chevy Chase. The film was intended as an homage to the Bob Hope/Bing Crosby \"Road to ...\" movies of the 1940s to 1960s. Bob Hope made a cameo appearance in the film.\n\n1987 saw the release of \"Dragnet\", which Aykroyd co-starred in (with Tom Hanks) and co-wrote. The film was both an homage and a satire of the previous \"Dragnet\" series, with Aykroyd playing Sgt. Joe Friday as a police officer whose law-and-order attitude is at odds with modern sensibilities.\n\nAykroyd appeared in five films released in 1988, all of them critical and commercial failures. A sequel to \"Ghostbusters\", \"Ghostbusters II\", was released in 1989; Aykroyd and the other co-creators were reluctant to make another \"Ghostbusters\" film but succumbed to pressure from the film's studio, Columbia Pictures. The film, while considered inferior to the original, was another big hit, earning . Aykroyd was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor for 1989's \"Driving Miss Daisy\". He was the second \"SNL\" cast member to be nominated for an Oscar, the first being Joan Cusack.\n\nAykroyd's directorial debut was 1991's \"Nothing but Trouble\" starring Demi Moore, Chevy Chase, John Candy and Aykroyd, sporting a bulbous prosthetic nose. The film was a critical and box office flop. Aykroyd's other films in the 1990s were mostly similarly poorly-received, including \"Coneheads\" (also based on a \"Saturday Night Live\" skit), \"Exit to Eden\", \"Blues Brothers 2000\", and \"Getting Away with Murder\". Two exceptions were \"Tommy Boy\" (1995), which starred \"SNL\" alumni David Spade and Chris Farley, in which Aykroyd played the role of Ray Zalinsky, and \"Grosse Pointe Blank\" (1997), in which Aykroyd had a well-received role as a rival hit man.\n\nIn 1994, Aykroyd made a guest appearance in an episode of the sitcom \"The Nanny\" as a refrigerator repairman. In 1997, he starred as an Episcopal priest in the ABC sitcom \"Soul Man\" which lasted two seasons. In 1998, Aykroyd voiced the role of Chip, a wasp, in \"Antz\". In 2001, he starred in the Woody Allen film \"The Curse of the Jade Scorpion\". Most of his film roles since then have tended to be small character parts in big-budget productions, such as a signals analyst in \"Pearl Harbor\" and a neurologist in \"50 First Dates\".\n\nIn 2009, Aykroyd and Ramis wrote and appeared in \"\", which also featured Bill Murray, Ernie Hudson, Annie Potts, William Atherton, and Brian Doyle-Murray. In 2010, he played the voice of the title character, Yogi Bear, in the live-action/CGI-animated-film \"Yogi Bear\". That same year, Aykroyd and Chevy Chase guest starred in the \"Family Guy\" episode \"Spies Reminiscent of Us\", an homage to \"Spies Like Us\".\n\nAykroyd appeared in two February 2011 episodes of CBS's \"The Defenders\", which starred Jim Belushi. He also appeared on \"Top Chef Canada\" as a guest judge.\n\nIn 2013, Aykroyd voiced the role of Scarecrow in \"\". In 2015, he appeared in a State Farm insurance commercial along with Jane Curtin, as the Coneheads, talking to \"Jake\", a State Farm agent.\n\nAykroyd was one of the executive producers of \"Ghostbusters\", a long-discussed reboot of the \"Ghostbusters\" franchise, which was released in 2016. Aykroyd had a cameo appearance in the film, along with many of the rest of the original \"Ghostbusters\" cast.\n\nAykroyd participated in the recording of \"We Are the World\" in 1985, as a member of the chorus. He wrote the liner notes for fellow Ottawa-born blues musician JW-Jones's album \"Bluelisted\" in 2008. He hosts the nationally, now internationally as well, syndicated radio show \"Elwood's BluesMobile\", formerly known as \"House of Blues Radio Hour\", under his Blues Brothers moniker Elwood Blues.\n\nIn 1992, Aykroyd and Hard Rock Cafe co-founder Isaac Tigrett founded the House of Blues, a chain of music venues, with the mission to promote African-American cultural contributions of blues music and folk art.\n\nMany other music and Hollywood personalities helped to finance it at its start. It began as a single location in Cambridge, Massachusetts, although other locations quickly followed, starting with a venue in New Orleans in 1994. In 2004 House of Blues became the second-largest live music promoter in the world, with seven venues and 22 amphitheaters in the United States and Canada. It was bought by Live Nation in 2006.\n\nIn 2007, Aykroyd and artist John Alexander founded Crystal Head Vodka, a brand of high-end vodka known for its distinctive skull-shaped bottle and for being filtered through Herkimer diamond crystals.\n\nAykroyd is also part owner of several wineries in Canada's Niagara Peninsula as well as the company that distributes Patrón tequila in Canada.\n\nIn 2009, Aykroyd contributed a series of reminiscences on his upbringing in Canada for a charity album titled \"Dan Aykroyd's Canada\". He helped start the Blue Line Foundation, which is redeveloping flood-damaged lots in New Orleans and helping first responders buy them at reduced prices. Coastal Blue Line LLC, hopes to eventually rebuild 400 properties in New Orleans.\n\nAykroyd is a member of Canadian charity Artists Against Racism.\n\nAykroyd was briefly engaged to actress Carrie Fisher. He proposed to her on the set of \"The Blues Brothers\" (1980), in which she appeared as a spurned girlfriend of John Belushi's Jake Blues who was trying to kill both brothers. The engagement ended when she reconciled with her former boyfriend, musician Paul Simon. In 1983, he married actress Donna Dixon; they met on the set of \"Doctor Detroit\" released the same year. They went on to appear together in three additional films: \"Spies Like Us\" (1985); \"\" (1983); and \"The Couch Trip\" (1988). They have three daughters, Danielle, Stella, and Belle.\n\nAykroyd maintains his Canadian roots as a longtime resident of Sydenham, Ontario, with his estate on Loughborough Lake.\n\nIn a 2004 NPR interview with host Terry Gross, Aykroyd said that he had been diagnosed in childhood with Tourette syndrome (TS) as well as Asperger syndrome (AS). He stated that his TS was successfully treated with therapy. In 2015, he stated during a \"HuffPost Show\" interview with hosts Roy Sekoff and Marc Lamont Hill that his AS was \"never diagnosed\" but was \"sort of a self-diagnosis\" based on several of his own characteristics.\n\nAykroyd is a former reserve commander for the police department in Harahan, Louisiana, working for Chief of Police Peter Dale. Aykroyd would carry his badge with him at all times. He currently serves as a Reserve Deputy of the Hinds County Sheriff's Department in Hinds County, Mississippi. He supports the Reserves with a fundraiser concert along with other blues and gospel singers in the State of Mississippi.\n\nIn an appearance on the \"Today\" show, Aykroyd referred to himself and John Belushi as \"kindred spirits\". In the biography \"Belushi\", Aykroyd claims that Belushi was the only man he could ever dance with. Aykroyd and Belushi were scheduled to present the Academy Award for Visual Effects in 1982, but Belushi died only a few weeks prior to the ceremony. Though devastated by his friend's death, Aykroyd presented the award alone, remarking from the stage: \"My partner would have loved to have been here to present this, given that he was something of a visual effect himself.\"\n\nAykroyd was openly hostile to the 1989 film \"Wired\", a biopic of Belushi (which featured Aykroyd as a character played by actor Gary Groomes), and has since refused to work with anyone involved in the film. He had actor J. T. Walsh fired from the film \"Loose Cannons\" after Walsh had already done two days of filming, after finding out that Walsh had been in the cast of \"Wired\".\n\nAykroyd considers himself a Spiritualist, stating that:\n\nAykroyd's great-grandfather, a dentist, was a mystic who corresponded with author Sir Arthur Conan Doyle on the subject of Spiritualism, and who was a member of the Lily Dale Society. Other than Spiritualism, Aykroyd is also interested in various other aspects of the paranormal, particularly UFOlogy. He is a lifetime member of and official Hollywood consultant for the Mutual UFO Network. Along these lines, he served, from 1996 to 2000, as \"host\" of \"\", which claimed to describe cases drawn from the archives of \"The Office Of Scientific Investigation And Research.\" In 2005, Aykroyd produced the DVD \"Dan Aykroyd: Unplugged on UFOs\".\n\nAykroyd is interviewed for 80 minutes by UFOlogist David Sereda discussing in depth many aspects of the UFO phenomenon.\n\nOn September 29, 2009, Peter Aykroyd Sr., Dan's father, published a book entitled \"A History of Ghosts\". This book chronicled the family's historical involvement in the Spiritualist Movement, to which Aykroyd readily refers. Aykroyd wrote the introduction and accompanied his father on a series of promotional activities, including launches in New York and Toronto, appearances on \"Larry King Live\", \"Coast to Coast AM\" and various other public relations initiatives. Aykroyd also read the introduction for the audio version of the book. In 1997, the Committee for Skeptical Inquiry (CSICOP) awarded Aykroyd \"in absentia\" the \"Snuffed Candle Award\" for hosting Psi Factor and being a \"long-time promoter ... of paranormal claims\". Following the awards, Joe Nickell wrote to Aykroyd asking for the research behind the \"cases\" presented on Psi Factor, particularly a claim that NASA scientists were \"killed while investigating a meteor crash and giant eggs were found and incubated, yielding a flea the size of a hog\".\n\nIn 1977, Aykroyd received an Emmy Award for Outstanding Writing in a Comedy-Variety or Music Series for his collaborative work on \"Saturday Night Live\". In 1994, he received an honorary Doctor of Literature degree from Carleton University. In 1999, Aykroyd was made a Member of the Order of Canada. He was inducted into Canada's Walk of Fame in 2002. In 2017, he was made a member of the Order of Ontario in recognition for being \"one of the world's most popular entertainers, well-known for his time on Saturday Night Live and the 1984 classic movie Ghostbusters\".\n\n\n\n"}

The character was created officially by Bob Kane as an enemy of the superhero Batman, and first appeared in \"Detective Comics\" #29 (July 1939). He is notable as the first traditional supervillain to be encountered by the Batman, as well as his first recurring foe.\n\nIn his first appearance in \"Detective Comics\" #29, Doctor Death develops a lethal chemical agent from pollen extract and enacts a plan to use the poison to extort money from wealthy Gotham City citizens. He is assisted by a large East Indian manservant, Jabah. He decides to eliminate Batman, and threatens to kill someone unless Batman stops him. Batman defeats his two henchmen, but is wounded when Jabah shoots him, though he escapes using a gas pellet. He then gets to Doctor Death's base, meeting him in his lab, and chases him around the building. In order to evade capture, Doctor Death ignites chemicals in his laboratory, presumably killing Jabah and himself in the resulting explosion. Doctor Death next appears the following month in \"Detective Comics\" #30. With a new accomplice, a Cossack named Mikhail, Doctor Death is this time successful in claiming a victim in his extortion scheme, but discovers from the widow that the poisoned man lost his fortune in the Great Depression. Batman intervenes in the plot, following Mikhail back to Doctor Death's base, and upon apprehending the doctor, discovers that his face had been horribly disfigured from the lab explosion, resulting in a brown, skeletal appearance.\n\nThe scriptwriter for \"Detective Comics\" #29 and #30 is an issue of dispute, leaving the creator of Doctor Death uncertain. Batman creator Bob Kane is officially credited as scriptwriter of these issues, though later Gardner Fox, the scriptwriter of \"Detective Comics\" #31 and #32, claimed authorship.\n\nAfter several decades' absence, Doctor Death was reintroduced by writer Gerry Conway in \"Batman\" #345 and \"Detective Comics\" #512 (1982). Conway's story is an update of the original 1939 tale. In this version, Doctor Death is depicted as a paraplegic, but his deadly gas gimmick remains the same. He is assisted this time by a manservant named Togo.\n\nDoctor Death was revived once again in \"Batgirl\" #42-44 and #50 (2003–2004) by writer Dylan Horrocks. The modern Doctor Death is a producer of biological weapons, often selling them on the black market to terrorists and other criminals. He is now depicted as a bald, gnome-like man wearing a lab coat and an oxygen mask. This incarnation of Doctor Death plays a minor role in \" Act Three\" where he is seen working with the crimelord Black Mask, releasing a gas into a crowd of panicking gangsters. Batman suspects that he and Black Mask are attempting to wipe out their competition.\n\nDoctor Death remains active in the DC Universe following the events of \"Infinite Crisis\". In the second issue of \"52\", he is mentioned as one of many mad scientists who have gone missing. He is depicted later in the series among other captured scientists and mad geniuses on Oolong Island that make up the Science Squad.\n\nHe was seen joining forces with Black Mask again in \"Batman\" #692, in his Ministry of Science.\n\nIn \"\" #17 and #18, the reader comes to know of his backstory involving an altercation with Thomas and Martha Wayne.\n\nIn September 2011, The New 52 rebooted DC's continuity. In this new timeline, a new version of Doctor Death makes an appearance in \"Batman\" #25 as part of the story arc \"\". He is once again established as one of the first supervillains encountered by Batman early in his career. A disgruntled former Wayne Enterprises scientist, Doctor Death murders several people with a serum that causes uncontrolled bone growth. He is depicted with a skeletal appearance, a result of testing his serum on himself. Doctor Death joins forces with the Riddler to try to seize control of Gotham City during a super-storm. \n\nIn \"Batman\" #29 (2014), it is revealed that Hellfern created his bone serum in an attempt to eliminate human weakness. This was motivated by the death of his son, a soldier who had been sent to locate the missing Bruce Wayne overseas. Doctor Death battles Batman aboard a blimp in the midst of the storm. He is struck by shrapnel from an explosion, which causes his mutated bones to begin growing again, seemingly killing him.\n\nA different character named Doctor Death appears in \"Doom Patrol\" (vol. 1) #107 (November 1966). In \"Sandman Mystery Theatre\" #21 (December 1994) Wesley Dodds encounters a serial killer named \"Dr. Death.\" This Dr. Death is responsible for euthanizing his elderly patients (in a reference to Jack Kevorkian).\n\n"}

Born as Farah Diba, she was the only child of Captain Sohrab Diba (1899–1948) and his wife, Farideh Ghotbi (1920–2000). Farah's father's family is of Iranian Azerbaijani origin. In her memoir, the former Shahbanu writes that her father's family were natives of Iranian Azerbaijan while her mother's family were of Gilak origin, from Lahijan on the Iranian coast of the Caspian Sea.\n\nThrough her father, Farah came from a relatively affluent background. In the late 19th century her grandfather had been an accomplished diplomat, serving as the Iranian Ambassador to the Romanov Court in St. Petersburg, Russia. Her own father was an officer in the Imperial Iranian Armed Forces and a graduate of the prestigious French Military Academy at St. Cyr.\n\nFarah wrote in her memoir that she had a close bond with her father, and his unexpected death in 1948 deeply affected her. The young family was in a difficult financial state. In these reduced circumstances, they were forced to move from their large family villa in northern Tehran into a shared apartment with one of Farideh Ghotbi's brothers.\n\nThe young Farah Diba began her education at Tehran's Italian School, then moved to the French Jeanne d'Arc School until the age of sixteen and later to the Lycée Razi. She was an accomplished athlete in her youth and became captain of her school's basketball team. Upon finishing her studies at the Lycée Razi, she pursued an interest in architecture at the École Spéciale d'Architecture in Paris, where she was a student of Albert Besson.\n\nMany Iranian students who were studying abroad at this time were dependent on State sponsorship. Therefore, when the Shah, as head of state, made official visits to foreign countries, he frequently met with a selection of local Iranian students. It was during such a meeting in 1959 at the Iranian Embassy in Paris that Farah Diba was first presented to Mohammed Reza Pahlavi.\n\nAfter returning to Tehran in the summer of 1959, the Shah and Farah Diba began a carefully choreographed courtship, orchestrated in part by the Shah's daughter Princess Shahnaz. The couple announced their engagement on 23 November 1959.\n\nFarah Diba married Shah Mohammed Reza on 20 December 1959, aged 21. The young Queen of Iran (as she was styled at the time) was the object of much curiosity and her wedding received worldwide press attention. Her gown was designed by Yves Saint Laurent, then a designer at the house of Dior, and she wore the newly commissioned Noor-ol-Ain Diamond tiara.\n\nAfter the pomp and celebrations associated with the imperial wedding, the success of this union became contingent upon the queen's ability to produce a male heir. Although he had been married twice before, the Shah's previous marriages had given him only a daughter who, under agnatic primogeniture, could not inherit the throne. The pressure for the young queen was acute. The shah himself was deeply anxious to have a male heir as were the members of his government. Furthermore, it was known that the dissolution of the Shah's previous marriage to Queen Soraya had been due to her infertility.\n\nThe couple had four children:\n\n\nThe exact role the new Queen would play, if any, in public or government affairs, was uncertain with her main role being simply to give the Shah a male heir. Within the Imperial Household, her public function was secondary to the far more pressing matter of assuring the succession. However, after the birth of the Crown Prince, the new Queen was free to devote more of her time to other activities and official pursuits. Mohammad Reza was always very attracted to tall women and Farah was taller than her husband, which led him to wear elevator shoes to disguise this fact. Usually when the Imperial couple were photographed, one or both would be sitting in a chair or alternatively the Shah and his Queen were photographed on a staircase with Mohammad Reza standing on the upper stairs.\n\nLike many other Royal consorts, the young Queen initially limited herself to a ceremonial role. In 1961 during a visit to France, the Francophile Farah befriended the French culture minister André Malraux, leading her to arrange the exchange of cultural artifacts between French and Iranian art galleries and museums, a lively trade that continued until the Islamic revolution of 1979. Farah and Mohammad Reza usually spoke French rather than Farsi to their children. She spent much of her time attending the openings of various education and health-care institutions without venturing too deeply into controversial issues. However, as time progressed, this position changed. The Queen became much more actively involved in government affairs where it concerned issues and causes that interested her. She used her proximity and influence with her husband, the Shah, to secure funding and focus attention on causes, particularly in the areas of women's rights and cultural development. Farah's concerns were the \"realms of education, health, culture and social matters\" with politics being excluded from her purview. However, Mohammad Reza's politically powerful twin sister Princess Ashraf came to see Farah as a rival. It was the rivalry with Princess Ashraf that led Farah to press her husband into reducing her influence at the Court.\nOne of the Empress Farah's main initiatives was founding Pahlavi University, which was meant to improve the education of Iranian women, and was the first American style university in Iran; before then, Iranian universities had always been modeled on the French style. The Empress wrote in 1978 that her duties were:\nI could not write in detail of all the organizations over which I preside and in which I take a very active part, in the realms of education, health, culture and social matters. It would need a further book. A simple list would perhaps give some idea: the Organization for Family Well Being-nurseries for the children of working mothers, teaching women and girls to read, professional training, family planning; the Organization for Blood Transfusion; the Organization for the Fight Against Cancer; the Organization for Help to the Needy, the Health Organization ... the Children's Centre; the Centre for the Intellectual Development of Children ... the Imperial Institute of Philosophy; the Foundation for Iranian Culture; the Festival of Shiraz, the Tehran Cinema Festival; the Iranian Folklore Organization; the Asiatic Institute; the Civilisations Discussion Centre; the Pahlavi University; the Academy of Sciences.\n\nFarah worked long hours at her charitable activities, from about 9 am to 9 pm every weekday. Eventually, the Queen came to preside over a staff of 40 who handled various requests for assistance on a range of issues. She became one of the most highly visible figures in the Imperial Government and the patron of 24 educational, health and cultural organizations. Her humanitarian role earned her immense popularity for a time, particularly in the early 1970s. During this period, she travelled a great deal within Iran, visiting some of the more remote parts of the country and meeting with the local citizens.\nHer significance was exemplified by her part in the 1967 Coronation Ceremonies, where she was crowned as the first \"shahbanu\" (empress) of modern Iran. It was again confirmed when the Shah named her as the official regent should he die or be incapacitated before the Crown Prince's 21st birthday. The naming of a woman as regent was highly unusual for a Middle Eastern or Muslim monarchy. The great wealth generated by Iran's oil encouraged a sense of Iranian nationalism at the Imperial Court. The Empress Farah recalled of her days as a university student in 1950s France about being asked where she was from:\n\nWhen I told them Iran ... the Europeans would recoil in horror as if Iranians were barbarians and loathsome. But after Iran became wealthy under the Shah in the 1970s, Iranians were courted everywhere. Yes, Your Majesty. Of course, Your Majesty. If you please, Your Majesty. Fawning all over us. Greedy sycophants. Then they loved Iranians.\n\nFrom the beginning of her reign, the Empress took an active interest in promoting culture and the arts in Iran. Through her patronage, numerous organizations were created and fostered to further her ambition of bringing historical and contemporary Iranian Art to prominence both inside Iran and in the Western world.\n\nIn addition to her own efforts, the Empress sought to achieve this goal with the assistance of various foundations and advisers. Her ministry encouraged many forms of artistic expression, including traditional Iranian arts (such as weaving, singing, and poetry recital) as well as Western theatre. Her most recognized endeavour supporting the performing arts was her patronage of the Shiraz Arts Festival. This occasionally controversial event was held annually from 1967 until 1977 and featured live performances by both Iranian and Western artists.\n\nThe majority of her time, however, went into the creation of museums and the building of their collections.\n\nAs a former architecture student, the Empress's appreciation of it is demonstrated in the Royal Palace of Niavaran, designed by Mohsen Foroughi, and completed in 1968: it mixes traditional Iranian architecture with 1960's contemporary design. Nearby is the personal library of the Empress, consisting of 22,000 books, comprising principally works on Western and Eastern art, philosophy and religion; the interior was designed by Aziz Farmanfarmayan.\n\nHistorically a culturally rich country, the Iran of the 1960s had little to show for it. Many of the great artistic treasures produced during its 2,500-year history had found their way into the hands of foreign museums and private collections. It became one of the Empress's principal goals to procure for Iran an appropriate collection of its own historic artifacts. To that end, she secured from her husband's government permission and funds to \"buy back\" a wide selection of Iranian artifacts from foreign and domestic collections. This was achieved with the help of the brothers Houshang and Mehdi Mahboubian, the most prominent Iranian antiquities dealers of the era, who advised the Empress from 1972 to 1978. With these artifacts she founded several national museums (many of which still survive to this day) and began an Iranian version of the National Trust.\n\nMuseums and cultural centres created under her guidance include the Negarestan Cultural Center, the Reza Abbasi Museum, the Khorramabad Museum with its valuable collection of Lorestān bronzes, the National Carpet Gallery and the Glassware and Ceramic Museum of Iran.\n\nAside from building a collection of historic Iranian artifacts, the Empress also expressed interest in acquiring contemporary Western and Iranian art. To this end, she put her significant patronage behind the Tehran Museum of Contemporary Art. The fruits of her work in founding and expanding that institution are perhaps the Empress' most enduring cultural legacy to the people of Iran.\n\nUsing funds allocated from the Government, the Empress took advantage of a somewhat depressed art market of the 1970s to purchase several important works of Western art. Under her guidance, the Museum acquired nearly 150 works by such artists as Pablo Picasso, Claude Monet, George Grosz, Andy Warhol, Jackson Pollock, and Roy Lichtenstein. Today, the collection of the Tehran Museum of Contemporary Art is widely considered to be one of the most significant outside Europe and the United States. According to Parviz Tanavoli, a modern Iranian sculptor and a former Cultural Adviser to the Empress, that the impressive collection was amassed for \"tens, not hundreds, of millions of dollars\". Today, the value of these holdings are conservatively estimated to be near US$2.8 billion.\n\nThe collection created a conundrum for the anti-western Islamic Republic which took power after the fall of the Pahlavi Dynasty in 1979. Although politically the fundamentalist government rejected Western influence in Iran, the Western art collection amassed by the Empress was retained, most likely due to its enormous value. It was, nevertheless, not publicly displayed and spent nearly two decades in storage in the vaults of the Tehran Museum of Contemporary Art. This caused much speculation as to the fate of the artwork which was only put to rest after a large portion of the collection was briefly seen again in an exhibition that took place in Tehran during September 2005.\n\nIn Iran by early 1978, a number of factors contributed to the internal dissatisfaction with the Imperial Government becoming more pronounced.\n\nDiscontent within the country continued to escalate and later in the year led to demonstrations against the monarchy. Pahlavi wrote in her memoirs that during this time \"there was an increasingly palpable sense of unease\". Under these circumstances most of the Shahbanu's official activities were cancelled due to concerns for her safety.\n\nAs the year came to a close, the political situation deteriorated further. Riots and unrest grew more frequent, culminating in January 1979. The government enacted martial law in most major Iranian cities and the country was on the verge of an open revolution.\n\nIt was at this time, in response to the violent protests, that Mohammad Reza and Farah decided to leave the country. They both departed Iran via aircraft on 16 January 1979.\n\nThe question of where the Shah and Shahbanu would go after leaving Iran was the subject of some debate, even between the monarch and his advisers. During his reign, Mohammad Reza had maintained close relations with Egyptian President Anwar Sadat and Farah had developed a close friendship with the President's wife, Jehan Sadat. The Egyptian President extended an invitation to the Imperial Couple for asylum in Egypt which they accepted.\nDue to the political situation unfolding in Iran, many governments, including those which had been on friendly terms with the Iranian Monarchy prior to the revolution, saw the Shah's presence within their borders as a liability. The Revolutionary Government in Iran had ordered the arrest (and later death) of both the Shah and the Shahbanu. The new Iranian Government would go on to vehemently demand their extradition a number of times but the extent to which it would act in pressuring foreign powers for the deposed monarch's return (and presumably that of the Empress) was at that time unknown.\n\nThe Imperial couple were aware of the potential danger which their presence carried to their hosts. In response, they left Egypt, beginning a fourteen-month long search for permanent asylum and a journey which took them through many countries. After Egypt, they traveled to Morocco, where they were briefly the guests of King Hassan II.\n\nAfter leaving Morocco, the Shah and Empress were granted temporary refuge in the Bahamas. After their Bahamian visas expired and were not renewed, they made an appeal to Mexico, which was granted, and rented a villa in Cuernavaca near Mexico City.\n\nAfter leaving Egypt the Shah's health began a rapid decline due to a long-term battle with non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. The seriousness of that illness brought the now exiled Imperial couple briefly to the United States in search of medical treatment. The couple's presence in the United States further inflamed the already tense relations between Washington and the revolutionaries in Tehran. The Shah's stay in the US, although for medical purposes, became the tipping point for renewed hostilities between the two nations. These events ultimately led to the attack and takeover of the American Embassy in Tehran in what became known as the Iran hostage crisis.\n\nUnder these difficult circumstances, the Shah and Empress were not given permission to remain in the United States. Shortly after receiving basic medical attention, the couple again departed for Latin America, although this time the destination was Contadora Island in Panama.\n\nBy now, both the Shah and Empress viewed the Carter Administration with some antipathy in response to a lack of support and were initially pleased to leave. That attitude, however soured as speculation arose that the Panamanian Government was seeking to arrest the Shah in preparation for extradition to Iran. Under these conditions the Shah and Empress again made an appeal to President Anwar Sadat to return to Egypt (for her part Empress Farah writes that this plea was made through a conversation between herself and Jehan Sadat). Their request was granted and they returned to Egypt in March 1980, where they remained until the Shah's death four months later on 27 July 1980.\n\nAfter the Shah's death, the exiled Shahbanu remained in Egypt for nearly two years. President Anwar Sadat gave her and her family use of Koubbeh Palace in Cairo. A few months after President Sadat's assassination in October 1981, the Shahbanu and her family left Egypt. President Ronald Reagan informed her that she was welcome in the United States.\n\nShe first settled in Williamstown, Massachusetts, but later bought a home in Greenwich, Connecticut. After the death of her daughter Princess Leila in 2001, she purchased a smaller home in Potomac, Maryland, near Washington, D.C., to be closer to her son and grandchildren. Farah now divides her time between Washington, D.C., and Paris. She also makes an annual July pilgrimage to the late Shah's mausoleum at Cairo's al-Rifa'i Mosque.\n\nFarah supports charities, including the Annual Alzheimer Gala IFRAD (International Fund Raising for Alzheimer Disease) held in Paris.\n\nFarah Pahlavi continues to appear at certain international royal events, such as the 2004 wedding of Crown Prince Frederik of Denmark, the 2010 wedding of Prince Nikolaos of Greece and Denmark, the 2011 wedding of Albert II, Prince of Monaco and the 2016 wedding of Crown Prince Leka II of Albania.\n\nFarah Pahlavi currently has three grandchildren (granddaughters) through her son Reza Pahlavi, Crown Prince of Iran and his wife Yasmine.\n\n\nFarah Pahlavi also has one granddaughter through her late son Alireza Pahlavi and his companion Raha Didevar.\n\n\nIn 2003, Farah Pahlavi wrote a book about her marriage to Mohammad Reza entitled \"\". The publication of the former Empress's memoirs attracted international interest. It was a best-seller in Europe, with excerpts appearing in news magazines and the author appearing on talk shows and in other media outlets. However, opinion about the book, which \"Publishers Weekly\" called \"a candid, straightforward account\" and \"the Washington Post\" called \"engrossing\", was mixed.\n\nElaine Sciolino, \"The New York Times\"'s Paris bureau chief, gave the book a less than flattering review, describing it as \"well translated\" but \"full of anger and bitterness\". But \"National Review's\" Reza Bayegan, an Iranian writer, praised the memoir as \"abound[ing] with affection and sympathy for her countrymen.\"\n\nIn 2009 the Persian-Swedish director Nahid Persson Sarvestani released a feature length documentary about Farah Pahlavi's life, entitled \"The Queen and I\". The film was screened in various International film festivals such as IDFA and Sundance. In 2012 the Dutch director Kees Roorda made a theater play inspired by the life of Farah Pahlavi in exile. In the play Liz Snoijink acted as Farah Diba.\n\n\n\n\n\n|-\n"}

She was involved in the textile design, printmaking, bookbinding, and typography workshops there from 1919-1923. After leaving the Bauhaus, she worked as an artist and textile designer in Berlin, Prague, and Hronov.

{"id": "2323677", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2323677", "title": "George Rapp", "text": "George Rapp\n\nJohn George Rapp (; November 1, 1757 in Iptingen, Duchy of Württemberg – August 7, 1847 in Economy, Pennsylvania) was the founder of the religious sect called Harmonists, Harmonites, Rappites, or the Harmony Society.\n\nBorn in Iptingen, Duchy of Württemberg, Germany, Rapp became inspired by the philosophies of Jakob Böhme, Philipp Jakob Spener, and Emanuel Swedenborg, among others. In the 1780s, George Rapp began preaching and soon started to gather a group of his own followers. His group officially split with the Lutheran Church in 1785 and was promptly banned from meeting. The persecution that Rapp and his followers experienced caused them to leave Germany and come to the United States in 1803. Rapp was a Pietist, and a number of his beliefs were shared by the Anabaptists, as well as groups such as the Shakers.\n\nRapp's religious beliefs and philosophy were the cement that held his community together both in Germany and in America – a Christian community and commune, which in America organized as the Harmony Society. The Harmony Society built three American towns, became rich, famous, and survived for 100 years – roughly from 1805 until 1905.\n\nIn 1791, George Rapp said, \"I am a prophet and I am called to be one\" in front of the civil affairs official in Maulbronn, Germany, who promptly had him imprisoned for two days and threatened with exile if he did not cease preaching. To the great consternation of church and state authorities, this peasant from Iptingen had become the outspoken leader of several thousand Separatists in the southern German duchy of Württemberg. In 1798, Rapp and his group of followers had further distanced themselves from mainstream society. In the Lomersheimer Declaration, written in 1798, Rapp's followers refused to serve in the military or attend Lutheran schools. By 1802, the Separatists had grown in number to about 12,000 and the Württemberg government decided that they were a dangerous threat to social order. Rapp was summoned to Maulbronn for an interrogation and the government confiscated Separatist books. When released in 1803, Rapp told his followers to pool their assets and follow him on a journey for safety to the \"land of Israel\" in the United States, and soon over 800 people were living with him there.\n\nThe initial move scattered the followers and reduced Rapp's original group of 12,000 to many fewer persons. In 1804, Rapp was able to secure a large tract of land in Pennsylvania and started his first commune. This first commune, 'Harmonie', (Harmony), Butler County, Pennsylvania, soon grew to a population of about 800, and was highly profitable. At Harmony, the Harmony Society was formally organized on February 15, 1805, and its members contracted to hold all property in common and to submit to spiritual and material leadership by Rapp and associates. In 1807, celibacy was advocated as the preferred custom of the community in an attempt to purify themselves for the coming Millennium.\n\nIn 1814, the society sold their first town in Pennsylvania to Mennonites for 10 times the amount originally paid for the land, and the entire commune moved out west to Indiana where their new town was also known as Harmony. Ten years after the move to Indiana the commune moved again, this time it returned to Pennsylvania and named their town 'Ökonomie', Economy. The Indiana settlement was sold to Robert Owen, at which point it was renamed New Harmony, Indiana.\n\nGeorge Rapp lived out his remaining days in the town of Economy, Pennsylvania, until August 7, 1847, when he died at the age of 89.\n\nJohann Georg Rapp was born on November 1, 1757, to Rosine Berger and Hans Adam Rapp (1720–71) in the village of Iptingen, northwest of Stuttgart in the Duchy of Württemberg. Rapp was the second child an oldest son of the family. His brother, Adam (born on March 9, 1762), and three sisters, Marie Dorothea (born October 11, 1756), Elise Dorothea (born August 7, 1760), and Maria Barbara (born October 21, 1765) later followed him to America; however, Adam died at sea. \n\nRapp learned the art of wine making from his father, a farmer. After his father's death in 1771, Rapp trained as a journeyman weaver. He also developed an interest in preaching. Vineyards and textiles would become a part of the agricultural, manufacturing, and commercial economy in all three of the Harmonite towns that were later founded in the United States.\n\nOn February 4, 1783, Rapp married Christine Benzinger of Fiolzheim. The couple had two children, a son, Johannes (December 22, 1783 – 1812), and a daughter, Rosine (February 10, 1786 – 1849). Johannes, who trained as a surveyor, died at the age of twenty-nine in an industrial accident. Johannes's name is the only one listed on a stone in the Harmonist cemetery in Harmony, Pennsylvania. (The Harmonists did not mark their graves.) The marker was donated by non-Harmonists and the Society accepted it reluctantly. The specific location of Johannes's gravesite within the cemetery is unknown. Johannes's daughter, Gertrude (1808–89), later became a minor American celebrity and organized the Society's silk production at Economy, Pennsylvania. George Rapp later adopted Frederick Reichert (April 12, 1775 – June 24, 1834). \n\nFrederick Reichert, Rapp’s adopted son, organized the relocation of Rapp's followers from Württemberg to Pennsylvania in 1804 and supervised the immigration of other Rappites to the United States. Reichert, who became known as Frederick Rapp, was the business leader and public spokesman for the Harmony Society, drew up the town plan for its new village at New Harmony, Indiana, in 1814, and served as one of the delegates to the Indiana Territory's Constitutional Convention in 1816. Frederick Rapp also helped choose the site for the permanent seat of government of Indiana in 1820 that was later named Indianapolis and held leadership roles in several Indiana banks. After the Harmonists sold their Indiana land in 1824, he relocated with other members of the Society to Economy, Pennsylvania, where he died in 1834.\n\nGeorge Rapp was tall, blue eyed, broad shouldered, with long hair and a patriarch's beard. He had a powerful voice, which matched his commanding presence.\n\nRapp and his followers, the Harmonites, believed Christ would return in their lifetime. The purpose of the community was to be worthy of Christ and prepare for his return. They were nonviolent pacifists, refused to serve in the military, and tried to live by George Rapp's philosophy and literal interpretations of the New Testament. After leaving Germany and coming to the United States, they first settled in (and built) the town of Harmony, Pennsylvania in 1804, and established the Harmony Society in 1805 as a religious commune. In 1807, celibacy was advocated as the preferred custom of the community in an attempt to purify themselves for the coming Millennium. Rapp believed that the events and wars going on in the world at the time were a confirmation of his views regarding the imminent Second Coming of Christ, and he also viewed Napoleon as the Antichrist. Rapp produced a book with his ideas and philosophy, \"Thoughts on the Destiny of Man\", published in German in 1824 and in English a year later.\nThe Harmonites were Millennialists, in that they believed Jesus Christ was coming to earth in their lifetime to help usher in a thousand-year kingdom of peace on earth. This is perhaps why they believed that people should try to make themselves \"pure\" and \"perfect\", and share things with others while willingly living in communal \"harmony\" (Acts 4:32-37) and practicing celibacy. They believed that the old ways of life on earth were coming to an end, and that a new perfect kingdom on earth was about to be realized. They practiced socialism within their community, but traded their exotic agricultural goods, including lemons and figs grown in movable greenhouses, with others.\n\nRapp and his group also practiced forms of Esoteric Christianity, Mysticism (Christian mysticism), and Rapp often spoke of the virgin spirit or Goddess named Sophia in his writings. Rapp was very influenced by the writings of Jakob Böhme, Philipp Jakob Spener, and Emanuel Swedenborg, among others. Also, in Economy, Pennsylvania, there are glass bottles and literature that seems to indicate that the group was interested in (and practiced) alchemy. Some other books that were found in the Harmony Society's library in Old Economy, Pennsylvania, include those by the following authors: Christoph Schütz, Gottfried Arnold, Justinus Kerner, Thomas Bromley, Jane Leade, Johann Scheible (\"Sixth and Seventh Books of Moses\"), Paracelsus, and Georg von Welling (\"Opus Mago-Cabalisticum\"), among others.\n\nThe Harmonites tended to view unmarried celibate life as morally superior to marriage, based on Rapp's belief that God had originally created Adam as a dual being having male and female sexual organs. According to this view, when the female portion of Adam separated to form Eve, disharmony followed, but one could attempt to regain harmony through celibacy.\n\nGeorge Rapp's life was not without controversy and problems. Rapp and the Harmony Society were involved in protracted legal cases: many relating to the monetary claims by former Society members who did not feel properly compensated for their time and labor, other cases concerned the ownership and sale of property Society members left in Württemberg, and legal complications from fines and payments made to avoid militia service. Rapp was called a tyrant and Society members his slaves. During elections, the Society was seen as a monolithic voting block which caused political ill feelings and generated animosity against Rapp. He was accused of killing his son Johannes – who died in an industrial accident. Rapp predicted that on September 15, 1829, the three and one half years of the Sun Woman would end and Christ would begin his reign on earth. Dissension grew when Rapp's predictions went unfulfilled. Perhaps his greatest error was in 1831 when he accepted Bernhard Müller, who called himself Maximilian Count de Leon, the \"Lion of Judah\" as the man who would unite all true Christians. In the year that followed Rapp changed his mind, but one third of the Society members separated and joined with Müller in establishing a separate community, the New Philadelphian Congregation. After Rapp's death in 1847, a number of members left the group because of disappointment and disillusionment over the fact that his prophecies regarding the return of Jesus Christ in his lifetime were not fulfilled. His last words to his followers were, \"If I did not so fully believe, that the Lord has designated me to place our society before His presence in the land of Canaan, I would consider this my last\".\n\nThe Harmonite commune ultimately failed because the policy of celibacy prevented new members from within, and the majority of the outside world had no desire to give up so much to live in a commune. The society was formally dissolved in 1906.\n\n\n\nBooks and articles in German:\n\n\n"}

{"id": "141969", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=141969", "title": "Henri Christophe", "text": "Henri Christophe\n\nHenry Christophe (; 6 October 1767 – 8 October 1820) was a key leader in the Haitian Revolution and the only monarch of the Kingdom of Haiti. \n\nChristophe was a former slave of Bambara ethnicity in West Africa, and perhaps of Igbo descent. Beginning with the Slave Uprising of 1791, he rose to power in the ranks of the Haitian revolutionary military. The revolution succeeded in gaining independence from France in 1804. In 1805 he took part under Jean-Jacques Dessalines in the capturing of Santo Domingo (now Dominican Republic), against French forces who acquired the colony from Spain in the Treaty of Basel.\n\nAfter Dessalines was assassinated, Christophe retreated to the Plaine-du-Nord and created a separate government. On 17 February 1807, he was elected President of the State of Haiti, as he named that area. Alexandre Pétion was elected president in the South. On 26 March 1811, Christophe created a kingdom in the North and was later proclaimed Henry I, King of Haïti. He also created a nobility and named his legitimate son Jacques-Victor Henry as prince and heir.\n\nHe is known for constructing Citadel Henry, now known as Citadelle Laferrière, the Sans-Souci Palace, and numerous other palaces. Under his policies of \"corvée,\" or forced labor, the Kingdom earned revenues from agricultural production, primarily sugar; but the people resented the system. He reached agreement with Great Britain to respect its Caribbean colonies in exchange for their warnings to his government of any French navy activity threatening Haiti. Unpopular, ill and fearing a coup, he committed suicide. His son and heir was assassinated 10 days later. The general Jean-Pierre Boyer came to power and reunited the two parts of Haiti.\n\nClaims about Christophe's place of birth and life before coming to prominence have been contested since the early nineteenth century. Born Christophe Henry, probably in Grenada but perhaps St Kitts the son of a slave mother and Christophe, a freeman, he was brought as a slave to the northern part of Saint-Domingue. In 1779 he may have served with the French forces as a drummer boy in the Chasseurs-Volontaires de Saint-Domingue, a regiment composed of gens de couleur (mixed-race residents of Saint-Domingue). They fought at the Siege of Savannah, a battle during the American Revolutionary War. It is claimed that Christophe was wounded in this battle.\n\nAs an adult, Christophe may have worked as a mason, sailor, stable hand, waiter, or billiard maker; if so, most of his pay would have gone to his master. One popular story claims that he worked in and managed La Couronne, a hotel restaurant in Cap-Français, the first capital of the French colony of Saint-Domingue and a major colonial city. There, the legend goes, he became skilled at dealing with the \"grand blancs,\" as the wealthy white French planters were called. However, none of the hotel's sales records support this claim. He was said to have gained his freedom from slavery as a young man, before the Slave Uprising of 1791. Sometime after he had settled in Haiti, he brought his sister Marie there; she married and had children. The political skills he learned as a hotelier also served him well when he later became an officer in the military and leader in the country.\n\nBeginning with the slave uprising of 1791, Christophe distinguished himself as a soldier in the Haitian Revolution and quickly rose to be a colonel during the revolutionary years. He fought for years with Toussaint Louverture in the North, helping to defeat the French colonists, the Spanish, British, and finally French national troops, and becoming commander-in-chief at Cap-Français. By 1802 Louverture had promoted him to general.\n\nThe French deported Toussaint Louverture to France, and brought in more than 20,000 new troops under the Vicomte de Rochambeau in an effort to regain control of the colony and re-establish slavery. Jean Jacques Dessalines led the fight to defeat French forces. The French withdrew their 7,000 surviving troops in late 1803; most fatalities had occurred as a result of a yellow fever epidemic among its forces. As leader, Dessalines declared the independence of Saint-Domingue with its new name of Haïti in 1804. \n\nChristophe was in charge of the Northern division of the country, where he notably supervised the first steps of the construction of Citadelle Laferrière. In 1805, General Nicolas Geffrard, commander in the South, approached Christophe with a plot to kill Dessalines; seeing an opportunity to seize power, he did not warn the self-proclaimed Emperor. Christophe's influence and power in the North was such that Dessalines, though aware of opposition brewing against him in the highest circles of power, found himself unable to strike against his general. The conspiracy involved the majority of Dessalines' senior officers, including Dessalines' Minister of War and Navy Etienne Elie Gérin, General Alexandre Pétion, commander-in-chief of the second division in the West, General Nicolas Geffrard and many others. On 16 October 1806, they signed a Proclamation entitled \"Resistance to Oppression,\" that declared the necessity to overthrow Dessalines' government and proclaimed Christophe head of the provisional Haitian government. Dessalines was assassinated on 17 October 1806.\n\nIn 1805 French troops were still posted on the eastern part of the island (mainly in Santo Domingo), where they were led by the French officer Marie-Louis Ferrand. He mobilized his troops and ordered them to seize all black children of both sexes below the age of 14 years to be sold as slaves. Learning of this action, Dessalines was outraged and decided to invade Santo Domingo, with his forces looting several towns, such as Azua and Moca, and finally laying siege to the city of Santo Domingo, the stronghold of the French.\n\nThe Haitian general Henry Christophe (referred to as Enrique Cristóbal in Spanish-language accounts), under Dessalines, attacked the towns of Moca and Santiago. The barrister Gaspar de Arredondo y Pichardo wrote, \"40 children had their throats cut at the Moca's church, and the bodies found at the presbytery, which is the space that encircles the church's altar...\" This event was one of several documented accounts of atrocities perpetrated by General Christophe, under the orders of Dessalines; they retreated from the Spanish-ruled side of the island after their failed invasion attempt of 1805.\n\nOn 6 April 1805, having gathered all his troops, General Christophe took all male prisoners to the local cemetery and proceeded to slit their throats, among them Presbyter Vásquez and 20 more priests. Later he set on fire the whole town along with its five churches. On his way out he took along, fashioned like a herd, 249 women, 430 girls and 318 boys, a steep figure considering the relatively low population of the town at that time. Alejandro Llenas wrote that Christophe took 997 from Santiago alone, and \"Monte Plata, San Pedro and Cotuí were reduced to ashes, and their residents either had their throats slit or were taken captives by the thousands, like farm animals, tied up and getting beaten on their way to Haiti.\"\n\nBefore leaving Santo Domingo, Dessalines \"gave the order to ... commanders posted in conquered communities, to round up all dwellers and subdue them to prison, in so, at first command, have them stomped by mules and other beasts upon arriving to the Haitian side.\"\n\nFollowing a power struggle with Pétion and his supporters in the South, Christophe retreated with his followers to the Plaine-du-Nord of Haiti, the stronghold of former slaves, and created a separate government there. Christophe suspected he was also at risk of assassination in the South. In 1807 he declared himself \"président et généralissime des forces de terre et de mer de l'État d'Haïti'\" (English: President and Generalissimo of the armies of land and sea of the State of Haïti). Pétion became President of the \"Republic of Haïti\" in the south, where he was backed by General Jean-Pierre Boyer, a \"gens du couleur\" who controlled the southern armies.\n\nIn 1811 Henry declared the northern state of Haïti a kingdom and had himself crowned by Corneil Breuil, the archbishop of Milot. The 1 April 1811 edict gave his full title as\n\nHenry, par la grâce de Dieu et la Loi constitutionelle de l'État Roi d'Haïti, Souverain des Îles de la Tortue, Gonâve, et autres îles adjacentes, Destructeur de la tyrannie, Régénérateur et bienfaiteur de la nation haïtienne, Créateur de ses institutiones morales, politiques et guerrières, Premier monarque couronné du Nouveau-Monde, Défenseur de la foi, Fondateur de l'ordre royal et militaire de Saint-Henri.\n\nHenry, by the grace of God and constitutional law of the state, King of Haiti, Sovereign of Tortuga, Gonâve, and other adjacent islands, Destroyer of tyranny, Regenerator and Benefactor of the Haitian nation, Creator of her moral, political, and martial institutions, First crowned monarch of the New World, Defender of the faith, Founder of the Royal Military Order of Saint Henry.\n\nHe renamed Cap-Français as \"Cap-Henry\" (later renamed as Cap-Haïtien).\n\nChristophe named his legitimate son Jacques-Victor Henry heir apparent, giving him the title of Prince Royal of Haïti. His second son was a colonel in his army.\n\nChristophe built six châteaux, eight palaces and the massive Citadelle Laferrière, on a mountain near Milot. With the remains of the Sans-Souci Palace, it has been designated as a UNESCO World Heritage Site. Nine years later, at the end of his monarchy, Henry increased the number of designated nobility from the original 87 to 134.\n\nThe two parts of Haiti struggled to increase agricultural production to recover from the expensive and damaging wars. The United States had only recently ended its arms and goods embargo against Haiti, and began war with Great Britain in the War of 1812. Christophe had to choose whether to enforce a version of the slave plantation system to increase agricultural production, or to subdivide the land into parcels for peasants' subsistence farming. The latter was the policy of President Pétion in the South. King Henry chose to enforce \"corvée\" plantation work, a system of forced labor, in lieu of taxes, but also began his massive building projects. During his reign, Northern Haiti was despotic but the sugar cane economy generated revenue for government and officials.\n\nHe made an agreement with Britain that Haiti would not threaten its Caribbean colonies; in return the British Navy would warn Haiti of imminent attacks from French troops. In 1807 the British Parliament passed the Slave Trade Act of 1807 to abolish the importation of African slaves into British territories. Because of increased bilateral trade with Britain, Christophe's government earned an enormous sum of British pounds for his treasury. By contrast, Petion's Southern Haiti became much poorer because the land-share system reduced agricultural productivity, and exports fell.\n\nAs king, Christophe created an elaborate Haitian peerage (nobility), originally consisting of four Princes, eight Dukes, 22 Counts, 40 Barons, and 14 Knights (\"chevaliers\"). Christophe founded a College of Arms to provide armorial bearings for the newly ennobled. For his personal coat of arms, Christophe chose a crowned phoenix rising from flames, and the motto 'Je renais de mes cendres' ('I rise from my ashes'), presumably in reference to the rebirth of Cap Henry after he himself burned it in 1802 to repel the invading French army. \n\nSome Europeans mocked his creation. The titles of the Duc de Limonade (Julien Prévost, Christophe's secretary of state) and Duc de Marmelade (Jean-Pierre Richard, governor of Cap Henry) were considered particularly comic by those unaware that they were actually derived from place names given by the previous French colonists.\n\nAfter Napoleon abdicated in April 1814, King Louis XVIII attempted to take back St Domingue. The Treaty of Paris, ratified on 30 May, gave Spanish San Domingo back to newly restored Bourbon France, and granted an extra five years of slave trade in which to recoup losses entailed by abolition of slavery. In October 1814, Henry I's ministers made public evidence of French schemes to try and recover its former colony, in the form of letters carried by French agents captured on the island. In the ensuing uproar, the nation mobilized for the expected French invasion and began an international public relations campaign. From November onwards, reprints of Haitian pamphlets, newspapers and open letters appeared in print media across the Atlantic world. Such broadsides and editorial interventions were accompanied by critical theoretical texts on race and colonialism such as Pompée Valentin Vastey's \"The Colonial System Unveiled\" (Le Système colonial dévoilé). Simultaneously, Henry opened up communication with the most prominent English abolitionists: his letter to William Wilberforce arrived on 5 January 1815, and began a new level of engagement between Great Britain and the Kingdom of Haiti. \n\nDespite promoting education and establishing a legal system called the \"Code Henry\", King Henry was an unpopular, autocratic monarch. His realm was constantly challenged by Petion's government of the South, in which \"gens de couleur\" held power. Toward the end of Christophe's reign, public sentiment opposed what many considered his feudal policies of forced labor, which he intended to use to develop the country. Ill and infirm at age fifty-three, King Henry committed suicide by shooting himself with a silver bullet rather than risk a coup and assassination. His son and heir was assassinated 10 days later. King Henry was buried within the Citadelle Laferriere.\n\nHis descendants continued to be among the powerful of Haiti. Pierre Nord Alexis, President of Haiti from 1902–1908, was Christophe's grandson.\n\nMichèle Bennett, who married Jean-Claude Duvalier and served as First Lady of Haiti during his administration (1980 to 1986), was Christophe's great-great-great-great-granddaughter.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "58338184", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=58338184", "title": "Heraldry of Castile", "text": "Heraldry of Castile\n\nThe coat of arms of Castile was the heraldic emblem of its monarchs. Historian Michel Pastoureau says that the original purpose ofheraldic emblems and seals was to facilitate the exercise of power and the identification of the ruler, due to they offered for achieving these aims. These symbols were associated with the kingdom, and eventually also represented the intangible nature of the national sentiment or sense of belonging to a territory.\n\nThe blazon of the arms of Castile is:\n\nThe Royal Arms of Castile first adopted at the start of the age of heraldry (circa 1175), that spread across Europe during the next century. The Spanish heraldist Faustino Menéndez Pidal de Navascués explained that there is no evidence that there was a consolidated Castilian emblem before the reign of King Alfonso VIII or these arms had pre-heraldic history as the heraldry of León. \nThe chancery of Alfonso VIII adopted a \"Signum Regis\" (seal) in 1165. This device had wheel shape, a defining characteristic of the chancery of monarchs of Castile since 1157. This author has pointed out that the emergence of the castle device Castile was similarly to the Leonese lion but at a much more accelerated pace. One of the earliest known testimonies that document the origin of the castle emblem was carried out by bishop Lucas de Tuy. In Castile, as it was common at that time, the first examples of the castle as heraldic symbols have been found at the reverse of pendent seals. The \"Signum Regis\" of King Alfonso VIII not always shown a castle. This monarch initially used a seal with a cross with pole. By the year 1163 was used a single side with an equestrian image of Alfonso VIII holding a lance without an standard, this element would have allowed us to determine the royal device used at that time. Following seals continued depicting equestrian images as central motif. The castle appeared for first time on the reverse of pendent seals. The first preserved seal impression with the castle dates from 1176, contained in a document located in the Toledo Cathedral. The matrix of this seal dates back before 1171 due to its typology. According Faustino Menéndez Pidal de Navascués it is likelythat the device of the castle was adopted in 1169, when Alfonso VIII came of age at fourteen. As a clear example of canting arms, the castle was adopted with a clear territorial connotation. This decision could be motivated by a desire to claim the sovereignty of the Castilian monarch against the Kingdom of León.\n\nSince from its inception the castle has retained a basic design - three towers, higher the central than lateral ones - leads to the conclusion that it is a native creation, different from the existing in Central Europe.\n\nConcerning the colours of the arms (tincture according to heraldry), it has been found that the combination «\"Or on a Gules field\"», was already fixed at least since the reign of King Ferdinand III, called \"the Saint\". This selection could be determined by the Heraldry of the consort of the King Alfonso VIII, Queen Eleanor of England, daughter of Henry II, King of England. The arms used by the Queen were the Royal Arms of England, three identical gold lions (also known as leopards) with blue tongues and claws, walking past but facing the observer, arranged in a column on a red background. Although the tincture \"azure\" of tongue and claws is not cited in many blazons, they are historically a distinguishing feature of the Arms of England. These arms, which are one of the oldest heraldic emblems, have had much success at that time due to the ease which offered be easily recognisable at distance.\n\nThis hypothesis is reinforced by the fact that the marriage of Alfonso VIII and Eleanor was celebrated from 1170 to 1176, dates immediately prior to the adoption of the emblem according preserved sources. Faustino Menéndez Pidal de Navascués defends as another possible reason for the choice of this combination of colors, for appearing more frequently in the arms. The selection of the third colour, shown in the door and windows, \"Azure\" (blue) could be due to the contrast with the other two, offering or that it was the third most commonly used colour after the previous.\n\nIn the Reign of Alfonso VIII was usual that the castle emblem was presented as device and not in a escutcheon. We can be seen this device on the tomb of Alfonso VIII and Queen Eleanor, in the Abbey of Santa María la Real de Las Huelgas (Burgos). The grave is decorated with the device of the castle and the English arms shown in a shield. The Castle, as a device and not as part of an escutcheon, appears in all Castilian coins of the time. Castle devices placed in row have been found on two stoles embroidered by Queen Eleanor from 1197 to 1198. One of the first representations of the castle emblem in an escutcheon has been displayed on a green brocade removed from the tomb of King Alfonso VIII.\n\nIn the middle of the 13th century, the Royal Arms of Castile were propagated all over Europe, a phenomenon that had no precedent or parallel, despite the male offspring of Alfonso VIII not survived him. This propagation had no a territorial component, except for the line that inherited the Throne of Castile because they were used as emblem of the maternal lineage and occurred in the Royal houses of France, Portugal and Aragon.\n\nThe Castilian arms were present in the heraldry of all the grandchildren of Alfonso VIII, except Kings Louis IX of France and Sancho II of Portugal that, as reigning monarchs, used their respective \"arms of dominion\". Castles \"Or\" on field \"Gules\" were included on the shields of the children of Louis VIII of France and Queen Blanche. We can also find them on the tomb of other maternal grandson of Alfonso VIII, Infante Alfonso of Aragon (1222-1260), the eldest son of James I of Aragon and Queen Eleanor, decorated with the four paletts \"Gules\" and differenced with a bordure charged with twenty escutcheons \"Gules\" with castles. But the most prominent example occurred in Portugal, when Afonso III added a bordure \"Gules\" charged with castles to the royal arms and remaining these until 1910, when the country became a republic. Since 1911 the bordure with castles have continued as part of the national coat of arms of Portugal.\n\nWhen his father, Alfonso IX, died in 1230, King Ferdinand III of Castile receive the Kingdom of León and united the two kingdoms. The King wanted to symbolize the union, for the first time, quartering the Castilian and Leonese arms, giving the arms of Castile pride of place. His aim was to have a device that reflects an indivisible union of kingdoms due to of the transitory symbolism of the impalement and secondary of the bordure. This method, very widespread spread in the Heraldry of different countries, was soon followed successfully throughout Europe. In the middle of the 12th century quarterings were used by monarchs of Aragon-Sicily, Brabant and others like the Kings of England, Navarre or Bohemia adopted it during the next century. John I of Castile impaled the Castilian quartering with the arms of Portugal as pretender to the throne of this kingdom. The Royal Arms of Castile quartered with the Leonese ones were borne by the Castilian monarchs until the reign of the Catholic Monarchs. The quartering was remained as symbol associated with the Crown of Castile territory until the promulgation of the \"Nueva Plant\"a decrees by Philip V in 1715.\n\nIn 1475, Isabella of Castile and Ferdinand II of Aragon joined the arms of the Crowns of Castile and Aragon in a quarterly shield. It followed the method created by Fernando III and giving the arms of Castile pride of place again. A series of dynastic marriages enabled the House of Habsburg to occupy the thrones of Castile, Aragon and Navarre, the arms of Castile have appeared in the arms of all Spanish monarchs and, since 1869 when was adopted, in all versions of the national coat of arms. As above, in all these cases giving the Castilian arms pride of place.\n\nLeaving aside the Spanish local and provincial heraldry, where can be found numerous examples and being the most prominent the coat of arms of Toledo, the Castilian arms are among the elements of the coats of arms of the autonomous communities (regions) of Castile and León (which has adopted the quartering of Ferdinand III), La Rioja, Castile-La Mancha, Extremadura, Madrid, Murcia and within the bordures of the autonomous cities of Ceuta and Melilla.\n\nOutside the Iberian Peninsula, the castle of Castile is depicted in the arms granted to capitals of the Spanish Empire, as is the case of the capital of Ecuador San Francisco de Quito, with a triple-towered castle \"Argent\" and two eagles Sable on field \"Gules\". It was granted to Quito by King Charles I (Charles V as Holy Roman Emperor), in 1541.\n\nThe Royal Crest of Castile, also called Crest of the Castle and the Lion, was it that used the last monarchs of Castile and Spain until the 19th century. This crest consisted of a castle or fortress with nascent lion on top. These two figures are charges of the Royal arms of the former Crown of Castile. King John II (1406–1454) adopted this crest was, its use is documented in ten and twenty \"doblas\" coins, minted in the city of Seville. According to historian José María de Francisco Olmos in his study of the late medieval Castilian currency, the obverse of these coins are represented a shield with the Device of the Bend and the Castilian Royal Crest. In the same study, the author recalls that the Crest of the Castle and the Lion is also represented at an image of King John II, an equestrian portrait of the \"Armorial of the Golden Fleece\", preserved in the Bibliothèque de l'Arsenal (Paris).\n\nFaustino Menéndez Pidal de Navascués noted that, previously, the Castilian monarchs had used a crest, consisting of the figure of a nascent griffin \"Or\". This crest, reproduced in the \"Armorial de Gelre\" (folio page 60v), was used by Henry II, John I and Henry III. After the reign of the Catholic Monarchs, there is evidence of its usage by Philip I in some versions of his archievement adopted as King \"jure uxoris\" of Castile. There are two prominent examples in his seal and the book of the Order of the Golden Fleece, illustrated by Simon Bening. The archievement of King Philip I was reproduced in this book due his status as sovereign and grand master of this order.\n\nThe Spanish monarchs of the House of Habsburg also maintained the royal crest in their archievement. At the beginning of the 16th century the lion of the crest, crowned, began to hold a sword and a \"globus cruciger\". Philip II and Philip III added two crowned helmets with nascent dragons, the crests of the Portuguese and Aragonese monarchs; besides, it gave the crest and arms of Castile pride of place (the central position). This archievement is placed above the bronze figures, portrait of the family of Philip II, by the Milanese sculptor Pompeo Leoni (1533-1608), son of Leone Leoni , that are located in the interior of the Basilica of El Escorial (Madrid).\n\nBecause of Spanish monarchs gave the Castilian quarters pride of place in their arms, the Royal Crest of Castile remained as single crest at their armorial achievement. Both latest versions of the armorial achievement of Spain with the royal crest, adopted by Philip V and his son Charles III, showed the lion of the crest with a modern royal crown (with eight half arches) and a scroll charged with the battle cry Santiago!. The meaning of the phrase is to praise St. James the apostle, patron saint of Spain. At that time, it was usual to consider the Royal Crest of Castile as the crest of the whole of Spain, thus it was exposed by heraldists as José de Avilés e Iturbide, 1st Marquis of Avilés, in his book \"Ciencia heroyca\". Since the 18th century, full royal armorial achievements were used occasionally and the crest of the Castle and lion practically fell into disuse until its demise in 1975, when the Spanish monarchy was restored.\n\nIn heraldry, supporters are figures or objects usually placed on either side of the shield and depicted holding it up, first appeared in English heraldry in the 15th century. Originally, they were not regarded as an integral part of arms, and were subject to frequent change. Lions were sporadically shown supporting the arms of the Castilian monarch and were introduced by John II. The lions as supporters were displayed until the reign of Philip V and, after 1868, in some ornate versions of the national arms of Spain.\n\nAs it was quite usual during the Middle Ages many flags, banners and standards were not standardized. There has never been a Castilian royal standard or banner with a unique design. There were varied designs of the castle or colours of the fabric, depending on the artisan or prevailing fashion. They have their origin in the representation of the arms of the Castilian monarch on cloth to be used as flag and, by extension were emblem of the Kingdom and the Historic Region of Castile. The field \"Gules\" was represented in more or less dark reddish tones, although a more specific colour, crimson, has been used very frequently in Castile.\n\nA triple-towered castle on red or crimson fabric has shown in stardards used by Castilian monarchs. The quartering of Ferdinand III was also displayed on his standard and it has served as the basis for current flags of autonomous communities of Castile and León and Castile-La Mancha. Further confusions led to apply the colour purple to a legendary «Castilian banner» (which neither preserved nor has never been documented), identifying the color purple as symbol of the Kingdom of Castile, something that influenced in the flag of the Second Spanish Republic and its lowest band. There are different hypotheses to explain the origin of the confusion. Fundamentally, the origin part of chromatic colour relationship among purple and red/crimson. Colour crimson was also widely used to represent the color purple, used in the ancient world as symbol of the sovereignty and authority of monarchs. One of the assumptions made is supported by the fact that with the passage of time many cloths, that originally were crimson, worn may become confused with other tones, as the purple. These inaccuracies were the creation of a legend on the purple colour of the banner used during the Revolt of the Comuneros against King Charles I of Castile and Aragon (later Holy Roman Emperor Charles V), between 1520 and 1521. Nowadays Castilian nationalism movement uses a purple flag charged with the triple-towered castle in the center and Castilian Leftist groups included the castle within a red star.\n\n\n\n"}

Basudde was born in Masaka District, in southern Uganda.\n\nLittle is known of his early life. According to his brother Sserunjoji, the reason he did not go further may be due to lack of funds to facilitate his love and passion for music. His mother Namyalo narrates that Herman Basudde attended Kibanda and Butenga primary school. One of his classmates says that in Basudde's school years he was a quick learner, and had a passion for art and graphics which took most of his time. Basudde also joined a school choir which earned him credits due to his soft and Ilouder voice.\nThe legacy of Busudde in the field of music came a long way from his father. The late Mark Makumbi, a former Bukedde TV and CBS Radio presenter while giving the background of Kadongokamu singers, talks about Basudde. He says that his father was an X-soldier from second world war veteran. He had a white friend called Brown, who loved him so much. When the mission was accomplished and was time to depart from one another, Brown gave him a guitar saying take this, I don’t have money to give you, let it be a souvenir to remember me from” on his return home, he kept the guitar because it was of no use to him.\nHe started to play a guitar at home without anyone teaching him.\nAs time went on, his mother tried to stop him from playing the guitar instead of doing household work or school homework; but his father insisted that he go ahead as he might prosper in a musical career. The guitar could hardly leave no space for books. This, in along with absolute poverty through which the family persisted, pushed him to drop out without completing his primary seven.\nWhenever there was a party in the village, he could escort his guitar paving a way to entertain the guests. In return as excitement paves, they gave him their appreciation and encouragement in terms of money.\nUnfortunately, others saw this upside down. The youth mostly laid a plan to throw him down since he was earning presents and gifts wherever he could go and entertain.\nAs his culture, one day he entertained Christian at their local Catholic parish. He sang a song he entitled ”amajjiini ngetala luno” (the rampant demons). The priest was overwhelmed where by he told him to play it again and again. At that function, Basudde earned a lot of money offered to him. This troubled his rivals so much. They planned a way of taking him off.\nIn the area, there was a rebel group called “FEDEMU” which had captured most of the southern part of Southern Uganda. Peace was now in their hands. Basudde’s rival youth approached them informing that Basudde had a gun. Immediately, they sagged his father’s house. They searched the whole place. They grabbed him and took him for interrogation. They tortured him unceasingly while asking for the whereabouts of the gun. After all that, he was brought back home nearly to death.\nHe was taken to Masaka referral Hospital where he was treated for many days. He was later returned home and given medicine there. As he gained energy, his father advised him to leave the village or else he would loss his life.\nIn the mid 1980s, he was picked by Eria Katende and brought to Kampala.\n\nHis career guide was the singer Livingstone Kasozi who trained him how to play a guitar, sing and perform live on stage. He toured East Africa countries, travelling to Kenya, Tanzania, and Rwanda. This tour raised him over 70 million shillings, a huge amount at that time. \n\nBasudde is credited as one of the musicians who revived interest in \"baakisimba\", mixing Western and Kiganda music to appeal to a new audience. He had a husky voice, and sang passionate songs about mischievous love affairs, philandering husbands, and bizarre witchcraft. In a popular song, \"Ekiwuka Ekyaga Muntamu\", Basudde used metaphor to invoke the AIDS epidemic in Uganda. In the song, the narrator dreams of a lizard-like insect invading his home and despoiling life, food and sex.\n\nBasudde died in an accident while travelling to his parents' house in Masaka, south of Kampala. His funeral was a national occasion, and the funeral fund raised 12 million shillings. Some saw Basudde as a rebellious spirit. He had left the Catholic Church to adopt animism and was attacked by certain clergy for forsaking religion in favour of witchcraft. He was accused of sensationalising his music by bringing seductively dressed girls onto the stage and commercialising the Kadongo Kamu singers.\n\nBasaaya Rocks Peter an historian says that Herman Basudde was a prophet since he could foretell what would happen before. His popularity is still rampant where by many upcoming artists visits his grave to seek wisdom.\nFred Ssebatta, one of Kadongokamu regents, asserts that Herman Basudde was creative and worked quickly. He continued by saying that it would be very difficult to compare Herman Basudde in writing music with anybody. He further said that whenever Herman Basudde could release a song, Ssebatta would target him on the second day.\nOn 12 October 2012, Gheto president Bobi wine paid a tribute to the great works of Herman Basudde. He narrates in time like this, 'how I wish prophet Herman Basudde could be around'... He left us to accomplish his mission but, his shoes are far big for us to wear' he said.\nBasude composed in his head and couldn’t repeat what he has earlier sung.\nHerman Basudde toured East Africa countries, travelling to Kenya, Tanzania finally to Rwanda. This tour raised him over 70 million shillings, a huge amount at that time. \n\nBefore his death, Basudde had foretold his death through words and actions. Aisha Nakito (widow) narrated what happened days before his death. On 10 June 1997, he went to meet Jane Basirika (concobine) after several days while touring EA . They had a meal in await for Serunjoji. As soon as Serunjoji came, he embraced him. They had some misunderstanding back ago, so they had a family union. After all, they set for masaka. His father had parralised at home. On their way, they stopped at Lukaya road toll for a snack. Here Basudde got anoid with a certain man and he was about to fight him. Sylivester Busuulwa. Settled the matter. He started the vehicle with a lot of anger at a high speed. Reaching Kabaale Bugonzi, a tragidy happened. As a lorry was overtaking, Basudde lost contral and his vehicle overturned several times. \"what a mess this man has caused me!\" He had his last breath. Hermann Basudde, a famous Ugandan singer and guitarist died in a tragic accident while travelling to his parents' house in Masaka, south of Kampala.\nBasudde had a huge following for his husky voice and the passion of his lyrics about mischievous love affairs, philandering husbands, bizarre witchcraft and other songs which propelled him from abject poverty to a fortune worth millions during his lifetime.\nHe had revolutionised the Kadongo Kamu (singers) who were known for their skillful guitar playing.\nBefore Basudde died he insisted that he be buried with his favourite \"dry guitar\", as he called it. He had noted that his long term colleague, Livingstone Kasozi had been buried holding his favourite cassette tape and he wanted his guitar to console him in the same way in the after life.\nBasudde's funeral was a national occasion. There was an outpouring of grief at the vigil by the graveside. Television showed a sea of humanity attending his burial. An announcer on one of the FM radio stations broke down while telling of his death. And his funeral fund raised Ushs12 million.\nBasudde's songs got rave reviews in the local press. The Uganda Monitor newspaper dubbed them as \"spiritually and politically inspiring\". Some regretted that he could not still live to fight the foreign culture that was corrupting Ugandan minds via the FM stations.\nOthers saw Basudde as a rebellious spirit. He had left the Catholic Church to adopt animism and was attacked by certain clergy for forsaking religion in favour of witchcraft.

He was a member of the Communist Party of Czechoslovakia (KSČ), the editor of a number of communist newspapers and magazines – \"Rovnost\", \"Sršatec\", and \"Reflektor\" – and the employee of a communist publishing house.\n\nDuring the 1920s he was considered a leading representative of the Czechoslovakian artistic avant-garde. He was one of the founders of the journal Devětsil. In March 1929, he and six other writers left the KSČ after signing a manifesto protesting against Bolshevik tendencies in the new leadership of the party. He subsequently worked as a journalist in the social-democratic and trade union press during the 1930s and 1940s.\n\nIn 1949 Seifert left journalism and began to devote himself exclusively to literature.

A member of the Republican Party, he previously represented the 3rd district in the Nebraska Legislature from 1997 until 2003. He was a candidate in the United States Senate election in Nebraska, 2012, losing the Republican nomination to Deb Fischer and in the Nebraska gubernatorial election, 2014, also losing the nomination to Pete Ricketts.\n\nBruning was born and raised in Lincoln, Nebraska, a fifth generation Nebraskan, and graduated from Lincoln Southeast High School. After high school, Bruning went on to the University of Nebraska where he received a Bachelor's degree in 1990 with High Distinction. Bruning was a member of Phi Beta Kappa and the Innocents Society, a senior honor society at Nebraska that honors 13 seniors for leadership, scholarship and service. After completing his undergraduate studies, Bruning attended the University of Nebraska-Lincoln College of Law, where he received his Juris Doctor in 1994.\n\nIn 1995, Bruning married Deonne Niemack; the couple has two children, Lauren and Jack.\n\nBruning served as general counsel for Vital Learning Corporation from 1995 to 1997.\n\nBruning ran to represent the 3rd district of the Nebraska Legislature in 1996. He defeated incumbent Michael Avery 55%–44%. He was the youngest member of the legislature. In 1998, he sponsored a bill that would extend loans to college students in order to encourage them to stay in the state. He won re-election in 2000 unopposed.\n\nBruning was elected Attorney General of Nebraska in 2002 with 66% of the vote, becoming the youngest attorney general in the country at the time, and the youngest in Nebraska history. He won reelection unopposed in 2006 and 2010.\n\nIn 2004, he worked with the Nebraska Legislature to create Nebraska’s Medicaid Fraud Unit. The Medicaid Fraud Unit recovered more than $20 million in 2012 and nearly $68 million since 2004.\n\nIn 2005, Bruning launched a criminal probe of University of Nebraska Regent David Hergert related to campaign finances. In the same year, he charged a 20-year-old man with rape after his 14-year-old wife became pregnant.\n\nHe served as President of the National Association of Attorneys General from 2009 to 2010. He traveled to Iraq as President of the National Association of Attorneys General (NAAG) and signed training agreement with Iraq Jurists Union.\n\nDuring a speech in August 2011, Bruning compared welfare recipients to raccoons. Bruning said his comment might have been \"inartful\" but that he was trying to make a point about spending cuts being necessary.\n\nIn August 2011, the \"Omaha World-Herald\" reported that Bruning had purchased a lakeside house valued at $675,000 near the Platte River in partnership with two Nelnet executives, almost a year after he and his office had been accused of acting favorably toward the student loan company by not enforcing payment of a $1 million judgment awarded to the State of Nebraska when Nelnet was under fire for alleged improper business practices.\n\nIn 2012, Bruning sued the Federal government of the United States over the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act with a 26 state coalition. His office led the legal challenge to the federal Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act’s provision regarding employer-paid health insurance requirements related to abortion.\n\nIn 2013, Bruning was fined a $19,000 civil penalty by the Federal Election Commission for campaign finance violations during his 2012 U.S. Senate election effort.\n\nIn late 2014, Bruning, together with Oklahoma Attorney General Scott Pruitt, filed a suit in the Supreme Court of the United States in which they asked that Colorado's Amendment 64, which legalized marijuana in that state, be struck down. Bruning and Pruitt argued that the Colorado measure violated the Supremacy Clause of the U.S. Constitution, since the U.S. Congress had enacted the 1970 Controlled Substances Act, which imposed a nationwide ban on marijuana. In connection with the suit, Bruning declared that marijuana was a \"gateway drug that is a detriment to society\" and that \"I don't want it to be a legal option for my children or your option or anyone's children in this state or in this country.\"\n\nBruning left office as Nebraska Attorney General with the inauguration of his successor, Doug Peterson, on January 8, 2015.\n\nIn 2007, Bruning entered the race for the U.S. Senate seat then held by Chuck Hagel, and raised more than $1 million for his campaign. Later that year, however, Hagel announced that he would not seek reelection; soon thereafter, former Nebraska Governor Mike Johanns joined the race for the now-open seat. Faced with an overwhelming likelihood that Johanns would win the Republican primary, Bruning withdrew from the campaign almost a year before the election.\n\nIn late 2010, Bruning announced that he would run in the 2012 election for the U.S. Senate seat held by Democrat Ben Nelson, whose approval ratings in Nebraska had plummeted after he provided the 60th and final vote necessary to break a Republican filibuster and pass the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act. In December 2011, Nelson announced that he would not seek reelection. Bruning was seen as the strong front-runner in the Republican primary race; former Attorney General and current State Treasurer Don Stenberg, favored by the conservative Tea Party movement, was seen as his strongest challenger. Bruning and Stenberg attacked one another aggressively throughout the campaign. Shortly before the election, the political action committee Ending Spending, financed by Omaha businessman Joe Ricketts, ran a television ad attacking Bruning for buying a lake house together with two executives of Lincoln student-loan firm Nelnet less than a year after Bruning, in his capacity as attorney general, had sought to waive a $1 million penalty against the company. In the primary election, voters delivered an unexpected victory to dark-horse candidate Deb Fischer, who won 41% of the vote to Bruning's 36% and Stenberg's 19%.\n\nIn 2014, Governor Dave Heineman was barred by Nebraska's term-limits law from running for a third consecutive term. In February of that year, Bruning announced that he would seek the governorship, joining the five candidates who had already declared. His entry into the race, although it came late, made him the perceived front-runner, supplanting Omaha businessman Pete Ricketts. In the course of the campaign, two groups that declined to name their donors purchased $1.3 million in television ads attacking Bruning, who accused Ricketts and his father Joe Ricketts of funding the groups, charges which Ricketts denied. Ricketts won the primary election, with 26.6% of the vote to Bruning's 25.5%; State Senator Beau McCoy received 20.9% and State Auditor Mike Foley 19.2%.\n\n"}
{"id": "2706657", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2706657", "title": "Jung Bahadur Rana", "text": "Jung Bahadur Rana\n\nShree Teen Maharaja Sir Jung Bahadur Kunwar Ranaji, (born as Bir Narsingh Kunwar (), 18 June 1817, Borlang, Gorkha – 25 February 1877, Patharghat, Rautahat; popularly known as Jung Bahadur Rana ()) was a Khas Rajput (Chhetri) ruler of Nepal and founder of the Rana of Nepal. His real name was Bir Narsingh Kunwar but he became famous by the name Junga Bahadur, given to him by first Prime Minister and C-in-C Mathabar Singh Thapa, his maternal uncle.\n\nHis mother Ganesh Kumari was the daughter of Kaji Nain Singh Thapa, brother of PM Bhimsen Thapa of then ruling Thapa. Through the influence of his maternal side, he enjoyed privileges. During his lifetime, he eliminated the factional fighting at the court, removed his family rivals such as \"Pandes\" and \"Basnyats\" and paved way for the finding of Rana, introduced innovations into the bureaucracy and the judiciary, and made efforts to \"modernize\" Nepal. He remains one of the most important figures in Nepalese history, though modern historians have also blamed Jung Bahadur for setting up the dictatorship that repressed the nation for 104 years from 1846 to 1951 and left it in a primitive economic condition. Others exclusively blame his nephews, the Shumsher Ranas, for Nepal's dark period of history. Rana rule was marked by tyranny, debauchery, economic exploitation and religious persecution.\n\nHis father, Kaji Bal Narsingh Kunwar, was in court the day Rana Bahadur Shah was murdered by his own half-brother Sher Bahadur Shah; as a retaliation Bal Narsingh killed him on the spot. For this action, he was rewarded with the position of \"Kaji\", which was made hereditary in his family, also he was the only person allowed to carry weapons inside the court. He was the great-grandson of Ram Krishna Kunwar, a great military leader at the times of King Prithvi Narayan Shah. Through his mother Ganesh Kumari, he was related to the aristocratic Thapa of PM Bhimsen Thapa, which helped him enter the royal court at a young age. Through his maternal grandmother he was related to the aristocratic Pande family as his maternal grandmother Rana Kumari was the daughter of \"Kaji\" Ranajit Pande, an influential royal courtier.\n\nBal Narsingh Kunwar was appointed as the bodyguard of Rana Bahadur Shah. When Shah was attacked on 24 April 1806, he was working at the same spot. Bal Narsingh Kunwar's second wife Ganesh Kumari was the sister of Mathabarsingh Thapa. Jung Bahadur was born in Langantol of Kathmandu. In those days the Thapas had influence over the administration of Nepal. From an early age, Jung Bahadur showed interest in courageous deeds. When he was 11 years old he was married to Prasad Laxmi, the daughter of Prasad Singh on 1 May 1828. His father then went to Dhankuta and took his sons with him. In 1833, Bal Narsingh moved to Dadeldhura where Jung Bahadur accompanied him and was admitted in the Military. When Bal Narsingh moved to Jumla in the year 1835, Jung Bahadur was already promoted to the rank of Second lieutenant. In 1837 when Bhimsen Thapa was dismissed, all his relatives were freed from the services. In this course, Bal Narsingh and Jung Bahadur too were dismissed from their services and their properties was seized. This incident made it difficult for Bal Narsingh to fulfill even the fundamental necessities of his large family. Jung Bahadur then went to Varanasi in search of work. There he wandered around to no avail. After a brief stay there, he returned to the Terai to work as a Mahout, but there too, he couldn't achieve any success. In 1839 he returned to Kathmandu where his wife and infant son had already died.\n\nIn 1839 Jung Bahadur was married to the daughter of Kaji Sanak Singh. Jung Bahadur received decent amount of dowry from the marriage which resulted in a slight betterment in the financial condition of the family. In 1840, the King Rajendra went to Terai where coincidentally Jung Bahadur was also accompanying him. There Jung Bahadur impressed the King by displaying great courage. The King was pleased with him and immediately gave him the position of Captain. After returning, Jung Bahadur was included amongst the bodyguards of the Crown Prince. Once, in the command of the Prince he had to jump into the Trishuli River riding a horse which he did and only just survived.\n\nAfter a while, Jung Bahadur was transferred from the Prince's group back into the King's. There he was appointed as a Kaji and was sent to the office of Kumarichowk. There he got an opportunity to properly understand the financial transactions of Nepal.\n\nJung Bahadur was known to be extremely ambitious. During those days, the youngest Queen was the actual ruler of the country with King only of name. Gagan Singh Bhandari was closest to the queen. Jung Bahadur had managed to please the Queen, the Prince and the Prime Minister with his diligent efforts. He had also managed to influence Henry Lawrence and his wife Honoria Lawrence.\n\nWhen Mathavar was still the Prime Minister, a cousin of Jung Bahadur was sentenced to death penalty. Jung Bahadur had requested Mathavir to convince the Queen to excuse his cousin but Mathavar denied. This had resulted in Jung Bahadur holding grudge against him.\n\nJung Bahadur befriended Pandit Bijayaraj who was the internal priest of the palace, and from him he started to gain valuable information about the Durbar. He had also managed to befriend Gagan Singh Bhandari.\n\nAfter assassinating Mathavar Singh, the queen gave Jung Bahadur the rank of a General and included Gagan Singh in the council of ministers.\n\nKot massacre\n\nThe Kot massacre took place on 14 September 1846 when Jung Bahadur Rana and his brothers killed about 40 members of the Nepalese palace court including the Prime Minister and a relative of the King, Chautariya Fateh Jung Shah, at the palace armory (the kot) of Kathmandu. This led to the loss of power by King Rajendra Bikram Shah and by Surendra Bikram Shah and the establishment of the Rana autocracy.\n\nBy 1850 Jung Bahadur had eliminated all of his major rivals, installed his own candidate on the throne, appointed his brothers and cronies to all the important posts, and ensured that major administrative decisions were made by himself as prime minister.\n\nAfter the Massacre, on the 15th of September the Queen appointed Jung Bahadur as the Prime Minister and the Commander-in-chief. After meeting with the Queen and the King, Jung Bahadur went to meet the Resident at the British Residency. There he informed the Resident about the massacre and also convinced him that the new government will be a great friend of the English. In the 23rd of September all officers of military and bureaucracy were called upon to their respective offices within 10 days. Then, Jung Bahadur appointed his brothers and nephews to the highest ranks of the government.\n\nThe Queen commanded Jung Bahadur to remove Prince Surendra from the rank and declare Rajendra as the new Prince but Jung Bahadur ignored it which resulted in Queen holding vendetta against him. A few people had survived the Kot Massacre who were secretly planning to avenge Jung Bahadur. The Queen secretly contacted them and conspired to assassinate Jung Bahadur. A plan was formed to do so in a gathering to be organized in the garden of Bhandarkhal situated at the eastern end of the palace.\n\nJung Bahadur had already placed his spies inside the palace to gather information about the Queen and the events in the palace. These spies were handed the duty of informing Jung Bahadur about the happenings in a secret manner. A certain Putali Nani whom Jung Bahadur had already taken in his side also worked inside the palace and she informed Jung Bahadur about the conspiracy.\n\nAfter receiving a command from the Queen to come to Bhandarkhal, Jung Bahadur took his fully armed troops and headed towards the garden. Birdhwaj was given the duty to bring Jung Bahadur in time. When he reached to the temple of Jor-Ganesh, he saw Jung Bahadur approaching with the troops. Sighting him, Jung Bahadur signaled Capt. Ranamehar and Ranamehar killed Birdhwaj Basnyat. The troops then marched towards Bhandarkhal where seeing Jung Bahadur approach fully armed with his troops, the conspirators started to flee. 23 people were killed in the massacre while 15 escaped. The next day, everything was seized of those who had been involved in this massacre. Jung Bahadur then imprisoned the Queen. Jung Bahadur then called for a meeting of the Council in the name of King Rajendra and charged the Queen of trying to assassinate the Prince and the Prime Minister. The Council agreed upon the charges after which the Queen was freed from all her rights. The Queen asked Jung Bahadur to let her go to Benaras with all her family which Jung Bahadur agreed to. The King went alongside the Queen.\n\nAfter the massacres of Kot and Bhandarkhal, the Thapas, Pande's and other citizens had settled in Benaras. Similarly, some citizens had gone to setlle in Nautanwa and Bettiah. Guru Prasad Shah of Palpa too had gone to live with the King of Bettiah. After knowing about the presence of the King and the Queen in Benaras, Guru Prasad went there and started to congregate an army and a plan to execute Jung Bahadur started to be formed. After staying for about two months in Benaras, the King Rajendra started to show interest in the matter. The King then, appreciating the plan, met with Guru Prasad and assured him of his support for the plan. The King also provided some financial aid.\n\nAfter receiving the support from the King, Guru Prasad started to organize the Nepalese people living outside the country. They started gathering people who had come in search of work and started training them.\n\nMeanwhile, the spies in Benaras who were analyzing each step of the King were providing reports to Jung Bahadur every week. Having understood the activities going on in Benaras, Jung Bahadur called a meeting of Council where he issued a charter mentioning, ' Now we cannot obey the King, from now on we will work in accordance to the commands of the Prime Minister Jung Bahadur', and sent it to Benaras. After receiving such letter from Jung Bahadur, the King panicked and consulted with his new minister as well as his Guru.\n\nThe Guru and others suggested the King to send a letter to the Army mentioning that the troops shall assist the King not the Prime Minister. The King put his stamp in the letter and sent it with Kumbhedan and Sewakram. They secretly reached Kathmandu and stayed in the house of one owner of Killagal. The spies of Jung Bahadur captured them from the house and destroyed the house the next morning. A pistol and a letter was found from them. Immediately, they were imprisoned and after a few days were hanged till death.\n\nOn May 12, 1847, Jung Bahadur gave a speech in Tundikhel. There he accused the King of attempted assassination of the Prince and the Prime Minister. The Council then decided to dethrone King Rajendra deeming him mentally ill, and on the same day Surendra was crowned as the new king of Nepal.\n\nHearing the news of the coronation of Surendra, Rajendra decided to take the responsibility of removing Jung Bahadur upon himself and declaring himself as the leader of the army, he left Benaras. Rajendra then appointed Guru Prasad Shah as the Chief of the Army for the operation of removal of Jung Bahadur Rana from Nepal and started to accumulate weapons and training the troops. The training of the troops were done in the camp of the King of Bettiah who was a good ally of Rajendra. Along with this, some treasure and weapons were bought from secret groups in Benaras, Prayag, etc., and sent to Bettiah. The King of Bettiah also provided some arms and elephants. A plan to attack Nepal was made.\n\nAntagonism from the Company forced Rajendra and his troops to enter Nepal. On the 23rd of July, the troops reached to a village called Alau in Bara and set a camp there. The number of troops available at Alau was around three thousand, thousand less than the number at Betiah who had fled mid-way.\n\nOne spy group of the Government of Nepal was keeping close eyes on the event of the rebel groups at Betiah. They sent the news to Jung Bahadur, immediately after which he sent a troop in the leadership of Sanak Singh Tandon to Alau. They were told to suppress the rebellions, arrest Rajendra and bring him to Kathmandu. On the 27th of July, the Gorakhnath Paltan reached and rested in a village called Simraungadh, not too far from Alau.\n\nAt dawn the next day the troops from Kathmandu started firing cannons at the camp. Great panic spread over the camp. Few armies from the King's side resisted and fought with Government forces. The former King too, for a certain period lead his troops. Guru Prasad fled from the location. Around a hundred soldiers of the King were killed in the battle and the King was captured and brought to Kathmandu.\n\nThe battle of Alau was a decisive one between the forces of King and Jung Bahadur. The King lost significantly in the battle. If the massacre of Kot had established Jung Bahadur as a dictator, the battle of Alau had helped him strengthen his dictatorship. Rajendra was imprisoned in an old palace in Bhaktapur.\n\nTowards the end of 1848 a vicious battle waged between the British and the Sikhs in Punjab. After hearing the news, Jung Bahadur met with the Resident and assured of Nepal Government's support to the British. But the Governor-General rejected the proposal fearing the possibility of the Nepali troops diverting to the side of the Sikhs at the crucial moment. Jung Bahadur then decided to demonstrate his power to the English. He was passionate for hunting but after being the Prime Minister he had not gotten an opportunity to hunt. In 1848, Jung Bahadur planned to go to the Terai with a dual purpose, one for hunting but primarily to show-off his power to the English. In the 22nd of December, with the King and a large group alongside him, Jung Bahadur left Kathmandu. The group included thirty-two thousand soldiers on foot, fifty-two cannons, three hundred \"risalla,\" and cannons to be pulled by two hundred and fifty mules. After getting the information of this large a force nearby its boundary, the Governor-General sent a message to the Resident asking him to figure out the reality of the matter.\n\nThe King and Jung Bahadur then camped in a village called Bisauli which was not too far from the territories of the Company. But the spread of cholera and malaria, which started killing the soldiers forced them to return.\n\nAfter the Treaty of Sugauli, the British had gained access to the internal matters of Nepal. Although the previous Prime Ministers of Nepal before him had somewhat resisted the Resident's involvement in the internal matter of Nepal, Jung Bahadur was of strong opinion that neither the Resident nor the Governor-General shall have any right to show involvement in the matters of Nepal. He therefore, wanted to establish a direct relationship between the Government of Nepal and the Queen and Prime Minister of Great Britain. He also had a keen interest in understanding the real power of the British. For these ends, he desired to travel to the Great Britain.\n\nJung Bahadur expressed his desire to the then Resident, Col. Thorsby. Thorsby suggested Jung Bahadur to write a letter, which he did and sent it to Calcutta. The Governor-General conveyed the message to Britain where they accepted the request and also asked them (Governor-General) to manage the necessary provisions, after which, James Broun-Ramsay, sent a letter of acceptance to Kathmandu. The visit was to be of diplomatic nature and Jung Bahadur was to visit as a Royal Ambassador.\n\nBy placing his brother Bam Bahadur Kunwar as an interim Prime Minister, Badri Narsingh as the interim Commander-in Chief, on the 15th of January Jung Bahadur left Kathmandu to Calcutta. During his stay at Calcutta, he met with the Lord and Lady Dalhouse and participated in a royal program. He also went to visit the Jagannath Temple . On the 7th of April the Nepalese team left Calcutta in P & O Heddington . The ship reached the Suez Canal through Madras, Sri Lanka and Eden.\n\nIn Egypt, Jung Bahadur and the team visited Cairo and Alexandria where he met with Abbas Helmi .\n\nOn 15 May 1850, the team reached Southampton.\n\nIn Britain, Jung Bahadur met and discussed various topics with Sir John Hubhouse, the Chairman of the Board of Trade, the Duke of Wellington and others. On the 19th of June Jung Bahadur and Queen Victoria met at a program organized in the Royal Palace. Jung Bahadur also visited the Parliament and closely observed the workings of the House of Commons and the British system. He visited the ministers and dukes and in one such meeting he proposed a direct relationship between the British and Nepalese, which the British Government rejected.\n\nIn Scotland, he was welcomed by William Johnston (Lord Provost). There he visited various forts and industries.\n\nOn 21 August 1850, Jung Bahadur and the team departed towards France. There he met with the then President of France. In France too, he expressed his desire to establish a direct relationship between Nepal and France, but the French President insisted on forming the relationship through the British Embassy, as there was no diplomatic relationship between the two countries. Jung Bahadur and the team stayed at France for about six weeks. On the 3rd of October they departed from Paris and on the 6th of November reached Bombay.\n\nIn India, he married an Indian girl.\n\nDuring his visits, although he unsuccessfully tried to deal directly with the British government while he was there, the main result of the tour was a great increase in goodwill between the British and Nepal. Recognizing the power of industrialized Europe, he became convinced that close co-operation with the British was the best way to guarantee Nepal's independence.\n\nOn January 29, 1851, Jung Bahadur reached Nepal.\n\nJung Bahadur was highly impressed by the rule of law, the parliament and the democratic system prevalent in Britain. In Nepal during those days, there were no written Acts. Different types of punishment were given to the similar kinds of criminal acts. Realizing that the prevalent system won't work for long term in Nepal, Jung Bahadur established a \"Kausal Adda\" in order to work on Acts. Electing around two hundred members for the \"Adda\", Jung Bahadur commanded them to draft legal codes as soon as possible.\n\nThe \"adda\" began its work by carefully studying the tradition, castes, race, class as well as religious situation of Nepal. Some members also studied the Hindu Ain being used in the courts of the English in the Company. After three years of vigorous research, a detailed Act was prepared. This Act included the workings of Court, system of Punishment, and different Administrative sections. They however, could not address the issue of Caste inequality as a progressive policy on such could have resulted in protests and turmoils around the society.\n\nOn 6 January 1854, the Muluki Ain was implemented around the country of Nepal. The copies of the Act were distributed around all offices, courts. The issue of this Act freed the administrators of Nepal from the confusion that had been arising from the Religious laws. The decision on cases happened early.\n\nJung Bahadur, with the Muluki Ain had formed the base of Law in Nepal.\n\nNepal began to experience some successes in international affairs during the tenure of Jung Bahadur. To the north, relations with Tibet had been mediated through China since Nepal's defeat in 1792, and during the early nineteenth century, embassies had to make the arduous journey to Beijing every five years with local products as a tribute to the Qing emperor. By 1854, however, China was in decline and had fallen into a protracted period of disturbances, including the Taiping Rebellion (1851–64), revolts by Muslim ethnic groups north of Tibet and war with European powers. The Nepalese mission to Beijing in 1852, just after the death of the sixth Panchen Lama, was allegedly mistreated in Tibet. Because of this slight, the Nepalese government sent a protest letter to Beijing and Lhasa outlining several grievances, including excessive customs duties on Nepalese trade. In 1855 Nepalese troops overran the Kuti and Kairang areas. The Nepalese-Tibetan War lasted for about a year, with successes and failures on both sides, until a treaty negotiated by the Chinese resident and ratified in March 1856 gave Nepalese merchants duty-free trade privileges, forced Tibet to pay an annual tribute of 10,000 rupees to Nepal, and allowed a Nepalese resident in Lhasa. In return, Nepal gave up territorial gains and agreed that it, as well as Tibet, would remain a tributary state subject to China. As the Qing Empire disintegrated later in the century, this tributary status was allowed to lapse, and even Tibet began to shake off its subordination.\n\nBegum Hazrat Mahal took refuge in Kathmandu with her 10-year-old son in 1859 Birjis Qadr and some other loyal staff. The then Prime Minister of Nepal, Jung Bahadur Rana, gave her shelter at the palace in Thapathali (which now houses an office of the Nepal Rastra Bank, Thapathali Durbar), said Samim Miya Ansari. Jung Bahadur Rana took the step despite being in good terms with the British at the time.\n\nIn 1858 King Surendra bestowed upon Jung Bahadur Kunwar the honorific title of Rana, an old title denoting martial glory used by Rajput princes in northern India. He then became Jung Bahadur Rana, and the later prime ministers descended from his family added his name to their own in honour of his accomplishments. Their line became known as the house of the Ranas. Jung Bahadur remained prime minister until 1877, suppressing conspiracies and local revolts and enjoying the fruits of his early successes. He exercised almost unlimited power over internal affairs, taking for his own use whatever funds were available in the treasury. He lived in the high style of an Anglicised native prince in the British Raj, although unlike the Indian princes he was the ruler of a truly independent nation, an ally rather than a subordinate of the British.\n\n\n\n\n"}

He devised a method to assist in solving Enigma messages which was dubbed Yoxallismus. After the war he worked at GCHQ until the mid-1970s.\n\nYoxall was born in Salford, and was the youngest out of four brothers. His father died young in a tramway accident. Leslie Yoxall was educated at Manchester Grammar School from 1925 and Sidney Sussex College, Cambridge from 1933, graduating with first-class honours. He received his doctorate in 1941.\n\nOn the outbreak of war, Yoxall returned to teach at Manchester Grammar School, and was next in line to become the head of mathematics.\n\nIn April 1941, Gordon Welchman wrote to Yoxall advising him that he would soon be asked to help with \"war work\". In due course, Yoxall was invited to join Bletchley Park and was, alongside Bill Tutte, interviewed by Hugh Alexander and then Alan Turing. Yoxall was selected to join the team in Hut 8, working on Naval Enigma as a \"temporary junior administrative officer\". He worked on the problem of \"Offizier\" (Officer) messages, which had been enciphered on Enigma with a second setting for additional security.

{"id": "62560", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=62560", "title": "Lucien Bonaparte", "text": "Lucien Bonaparte\n\nLucien Bonaparte, Prince Français, 1st Prince of Canino and Musignano (born Luciano Buonaparte; 21 May 1775 – 29 June 1840), the third surviving son of Carlo Bonaparte and his wife Letizia Ramolino, was a French statesman, who served as the final President of the Council of Five Hundred at the end of the French Revolution.\n\nLucien was a younger brother of Joseph and Napoleon Bonaparte, and an older brother of Elisa, Louis, Pauline, Caroline and Jérôme Bonaparte. Lucien held genuinely revolutionary views, which led to an often abrasive relationship with his brother Napoleon, who seized control of the French government in 1799, when Lucien was 24.\n\nLucien Bonaparte's rise during the French Revolution, unlike Napoleon Bonaparte's other siblings, was not based on familial connections or nepotism. This was one of the issues that caused friction between Lucien and Napoleon in the early years of the 19th century, as their political differences deepened. Both Lucien and Napoleon had a very keen interest in historical antiquity as youngsters.\n\nLucien was born in Ajaccio, Corsica in 1775, and was educated in mainland France, at the College d'Autun, the military school in Brienne, and at seminary in Aix-en-Provence. In 1769 the Corsican Republic had been conquered by French forces and annexed into France. Lucien's father Carlo Bonaparte had been a strong supporter of Corsican patriots under Pasquale Paoli, but later switched to become a supporter of French rule.\n\nA 14-year-old Lucien returned to Corsica at the outbreak of the French Revolution in 1789 and became an outspoken speaker in the Jacobin Club at Ajaccio, where he renamed himself \"Brutus\". An ally of Maximilien Robespierre before and during the Reign of Terror, he was briefly imprisoned (at Aix-en-Provence) after the coup of 9 Thermidor on 27 July 1794, which deposed Robespierre and led to Robespierre's execution the following day.\n\nAs president of the Council of Five Hundred — which he removed to the suburban security of Saint-Cloud — Lucien Bonaparte was crucial with a combination of bravado and disinformation to the \"coup d'état\" of 18 Brumaire (date based on the French Revolutionary Calendar) in which Napoleon Bonaparte overthrew the government of the Directory to replace it by the Consulate on 9 November 1799. Lucien mounted a horse and galvanized the grenadiers by pointing a sword at his brother and swearing to run him through if he ever betrayed the principles of \"Liberté, égalité, fraternité\". The following day Lucien arranged for Napoleon's formal election as First Consul.\n\nNapoleon made him Minister of the Interior under the Consulate, which enabled Lucien to falsify the results of the plebiscite but which brought him into competition with Joseph Fouché, the chief of police, who showed Napoleon a subversive pamphlet that was probably written by Lucien, and effected a breach between the brothers. Lucien was sent as ambassador to the court of Charles IV of Spain, (November, 1800), where his diplomatic talents won over the Bourbon royal family and, perhaps as importantly, the minister Manuel de Godoy.\n\nThough he was a member of the \"Tribunat\" in 1802 and was made a senator of the First French Empire, Lucien came to oppose many of Napoleon's ideas. In 1804, with Lucien disliking Napoleon's intention to declare himself as Emperor of the French and to marry Lucien off to a Bourbon Spanish princess, the Queen of Etruria, Lucien spurned all imperial honours and went into self-imposed exile, living initially in Rome, where he bought the Villa Rufinella in Frascati.\n\nIn 1809, Napoleon increased pressure on Lucien to divorce his wife and return to France, even having their mother write a letter encouraging him to abandon her and return. With the whole of the Papal States annexed to France and the Pope imprisoned, Lucien was a virtual prisoner in his Italian estates, requiring permission of the Military Governor to venture off his property. He attempted to sail to the United States to escape his situation but was captured by the British. When he disembarked in Britain, he was greeted with cheers and applause by the crowd, many of whom saw him as anti-Napoleon.\n\nThe government permitted Lucien to settle comfortably with his family at Ludlow, and later at Thorngrove House in Grimley, Worcestershire, where he worked on a heroic poem on Charlemagne. Napoleon, believing Lucien had deliberately gone to Britain and thus a traitor, had Lucien omitted from the Imperial almanacs of the Bonapartes from 1811 until his 1814 abdication.\n\nLucien returned to France following his brother's abdication in April 1814. Lucien continued to Rome where on 18 August 1814 he was made Prince of Canino, Count of Apollino, and Lord of Nemori by Pope Pius VII and Prince of Musignano on 21 March 1824 by Pope Leo XII.\n\nIn the Hundred Days after Napoleon's return to France from exile in Elba, Lucien rallied to his brother's cause, and they joined forces once again during Napoleon's brief return to power. His brother made him a French Prince and included his children into the Imperial Family, but this was not recognized by the Bourbons after Napoleon's second abdication. Subsequently, Lucien was proscribed at the Restoration and deprived of his \"fauteuil\" at the Académie française. In 1836 he wrote his \"Mémoires\". He died in Viterbo, Italy, on 29 June 1840, of stomach cancer, the same disease that claimed his father, his sister Pauline and his brother Napoleon.\n\nLucien Bonaparte was the inspiration behind the Napoleonic reconstitution of the dispersed Académie française in 1803, where he took a seat. He collected paintings in \"la maison de campagne\" at Brienne, was a member of Jeanne Françoise Julie Adélaïde Récamier's salon and wrote a novel, \"La Tribu indienne.\" He was an amateur archeologist, establishing excavations at his property in Frascati which produced a complete statue of Tiberius, and at Musignano which rendered a bust of Juno. Bonaparte owned a parcel which had once formed part of Cicero's estate called Tusculum, and was much given to commenting on the fact. In 1825, Bonaparte excavated the so-called Tusculum portrait of Julius Caesar at the Tusculum's forum.\n\nHis first wife was his landlord's daughter, Christine Boyer (3 July 1771 – 14 May 1800), the illiterate sister of an innkeeper of Saint-Maximin-la-Sainte-Baume, and by her he had four children:\n\nHis second wife was Alexandrine de Bleschamp (23 February 1778 – 12 July 1855), widow of Hippolyte Jouberthon, known as \"Madame Jouberthon\", and by her he had ten children:\n\n"}

{"id": "9011472", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=9011472", "title": "Margaret Hale", "text": "Margaret Hale\n\nMargaret Hale is the heroine of Elizabeth Gaskell's 1855 novel \"North and South\". Initially, Gaskell wanted the title of the novel to be \"Margaret Hale\", but Charles Dickens, the editor of \"Household Words\", the magazine in which the novel was serialized, insisted on \"North and South\".\n\nFrom Chapter Two:\n\nFrom Chapter Seven:\nMargaret was a character created to challenge stereotypes about women's role in the 19th century. The theme of challenging stereotypes is one which is integral throughout the novel.\n\nMargaret Hale is nineteen years old and before she was 10, lived in Helstone in Hampshire, in the south of England, with her parents—Richard, a Anglican minister, and Maria—and older brother, Frederick. When she was nine years old, Margaret was sent to live in London with her aunt, Mrs Shaw, and cousin. Edith and Margaret were the same age, and became fast friends.\n\nFrederick, meanwhile, joined the Royal Navy. Once at sea, he took part in a mutiny against his cruel captain. The Hales realized that Frederick, branded a traitor, would be hanged if he ever returned to England.\n\nWhen the girls grew up, Edith married Capt. Lennox. Lennox had a younger brother, Henry, who became infatuated with Margaret. She rejected his advances, and chose to move back to Helstone. Mr Hale, however, had begun to question his faith and the doctrines laid out in the Book of Common Prayer. When asked to renew his vows by the bishop, Mr Hale could not. Quitting his profession, Mr Hale moved his wife and daughter to Milton, in the north of England, where he took up work as a tutor.\n\nOne of Mr Hale's pupils is a local mill owner, John Thornton. Margaret takes an instant dislike to Thornton, seeing him as the embodiment of the harsh, working-class north. Margaret, feeling homesick, romanticizes the south. Mr Thornton, on the other hand, is immediately struck by Margaret. \"He did not understand who she was,\" when he first saw her, \"as he caught the simple, straight, unabashed look, which showed that his being there was of no concern to the beautiful countenance, and called up no flush of surprise to the pale ivory of the complexion. He had heard that Mr. Hale had a daughter, but he had imagined that she was a little girl.\" Margaret eventually comes to feel at home in the north; she makes friends, including Bessy Higgins, a dying young woman.\n\nThe workers in all of the mills around Milton are dissatisfied and strike. As the strikers grow desperate, a mob of workers comes to the Thornton's house, where Margaret is calling on Mrs Thornton, John's mother, and his sister Fanny. Thornton goes out to speak to the rioters at Margaret's behest. Afraid that they will kill him, Margaret rushes out to Thornton. Margaret believes that no one would try to hurt a woman, and throws her arms around Thornton, to protect him. Margaret is mistaken, however. A rock is thrown from the crowd by a \"group of lads\", and Margaret is knocked out.\n\nMrs Thornton, who is wary of Margaret and her son's affection for her, surmises that Margaret acted as she did out of love for Mr Thornton. She tells her son so, and Thornton proposes to Margaret. She insists that it was her responsibility to save him because she had sent him out to talk to the men, and that she would have done the same thing for any other \"poor desperate man in that crowd\".\n\nMrs Hale, even less happy to be in Milton than Margaret, is dying. She wants to see Frederick one last time, so Margaret secretly writes to him in Spain, where he has been living. Frederick comes to visit the Hales in Milton, and manages to stay hidden before she dies. When Margaret takes Frederick to the train station, to get him out of Milton; they are seen by three people. The first, Mr Thornton, sees Margaret with an unknown man \"with whom she had stood in an attitude of such familiar confidence\". Margaret sees him watching her, and spends much of the rest of the novel bearing the guilt of having fallen from Thornton's regard. The other man who sees the Hale siblings is a man named Leonards. He knows that there is a bounty on Frederick's head, and tries to grab him. The two struggle and Leonards is tripped and falls onto the side of the railroad. Fatally injured, he dies the next morning.\n\nThere is an inquest into Leonards' death. The third person to see Margaret and her brother, a boy who works at a Milton grocer's, comes forward. He claims to have seen Margaret with the man who fought Leonards. Margaret does not know if her brother is still in the country. Trying to protect Frederick, she denies having been at the train station. Mr Thornton is a local magistrate, and becomes involved in the case. He knows that Margaret was at the station, but, still in love with her, defends her, taking over the case. Margaret is declared innocent of any involvement in Leonards' death. She knows that Thornton has heard her claiming not to have been at the train station. Margaret is humbled by Thornton's deed and is acutely aware that she must now be accounted as a liar in his eyes.\n\nMargaret and her father slowly begin to recover from Mrs Hale's death—they are helped by the news of Frederick's safe return to Spain, though not by Bessy's death. Mr Hale receives an invitation to visit an old friend, Mr Bell, in Oxford. Margaret insists that her father go; while there, however, he dies.\n\nMargaret moves back to London, to live with Capt. and Mrs Lennox. She is unhappy, however, and listless. She spends much time considering the events of the past and longs to set the record straight with Thornton and win back his regard, which she believes is her only hope in repairing the damaged relationship with him. She longs for any word from Milton and, believing that she threw her one chance for happiness in marriage away, she declares to her cousin that she will never marry. She develops a close bond with Edith's young son, Sholto. It is Margaret who disciplines the child, whereas Edith would simply spoil him, and the Lennox family appreciates this—along with their genuine love for Margaret, they encourage her to stay with them. Edith and her mother even hint to Henry to begin wooing Margaret, again; they dream of the whole family living together, forever.\n\nShe visits Helstone with Mr. Bell, and finds herself quite disillusioned with the place she had idealised for so long. Margaret asks Mr Bell to tell Thornton about Frederick, but Mr Bell dies before he can do so. He leaves Margaret a legacy which includes Marlborough Mills and the Thornton house.\n\nMeanwhile, Mr Thornton's cotton business has failed. He is in London to settle his business affairs with his new landlord, Margaret. When Margaret presents Thornton with a generous business proposal that will save the mill, he realises that she is no longer indifferent or antagonistic to him. He again proposes marriage and, since she has learned to love him, she accepts.\n\nNorth and South has been adapted for the small screen, twice. In 1975, Rosalind Shanks played Margaret. In 2004, Margaret was played by Daniela Denby-Ashe.\n\n"}

A professor at the UCL Institute of Archaeology, he previously worked for 25 years as a professor at the University of Sheffield in England, and was the director of the Stonehenge Riverside Project. A prolific author, he has also written a variety of books on the subject.\n\nParker Pearson gained his BA in archaeology from Southampton University in 1979. Supervised by Ian Hodder as a post-graduate at Cambridge, Parker Pearson was a contemporary of Sheena Crawford, Daniel Miller, Henrietta Moore, Christopher Tilley and Alice Welbourn; these students were influenced by Hodder's ideas, then a pioneering part of the post-processualist current within archaeological theory. He went on to gain his PhD at the University of Cambridge in 1985, producing a thesis on burials and bog bodies in Iron Age Denmark.\n\nA media personality, Parker Pearson has appeared several times in the Channel 4 show \"Time Team\" in particular in one looking at the excavation of Durrington Walls. He also appeared in the National Geographic Channel documentary \"Stonehenge Decoded\", along with the PBS programme \"NOVA: Secrets of Stonehenge\".\n\nParker Pearson was born in 1957. He would later inform interviewers that he first took an interest in the past when searching for fossils in his father's driveway gravel aged 4, extending that interest into the human past aged 6 when he read a library book entitled \"Fun with Archaeology\". Deciding to study the subject at the undergraduate level, he attended the University of Southampton, attaining a first class BA with honours in Archaeology in 1979.\n\nParker Pearson became interested in Marxism. In the 1984 anthology \"Ideology, Power and Prehistory\", edited by Daniel Miller and Christopher Tilley, Parker Pearson published a paper in which he examined the pre-state societies of Jutland from a Marxist perspective. At the start of this paper, he noted that it had repurcussions for Marxism in that its findings discerned \"a certain blurring between capitalism and non-capitalism.\" He obtained his PhD from King's College, University of Cambridge in 1985, for a thesis which he had titled \"Death, society and social change: the Iron Age of southern Jutland 200 BC – 600 AD\" in which he discussed what was known about the bog bodies of Denmark; it would remain unpublished.\n\nFrom 1984 through to 1990, Parker Pearson worked as an Inspector of Monuments for English Heritage, and in 1989 he received membership to the Institute for Archaeologists. In 1990, he secured an academic teaching position at the Department of Archaeology at the University of Sheffield, where he would work for the next 21 years. In 1991 he was admitted as a Fellow of the Society of Antiquaries of London, and in 1996 then became a Fellow of the Society of Antiquaries of Scotland.\n\nFrom 2003 through to 2009, Parker Pearson directed the Stonehenge Riverside Project. The project garnered three major archaeological awards: the Andante Travel Archaeology Award (2008), the Royal Society of Northern Antiquaries Award (2009), and the UK Archaeological Research Project of the Year (2010). His work in leading the project also led to Parker Pearson being personally awarded the UK Archaeologist of the Year award in 2010.\n\nParker Pearson and his team of researchers played a key role in the discovery of a new henge site along the River Avon that links to Stonehenge. This new site was uncovered through excavation during the Stonehenge Riverside Project and was given the name \"Bluestonehenge\" or \"Bluehenge\" because traces of bluestones were found during the excavation.\n\nFrom 2006 through to 2009, he served as the Vice-President of the Prehistoric Society. Interacting with various parts of the media, Parker Pearson has published articles in a variety of different sources, such as on the BBC website, has given interviews to groups such as Pagans for Archaeology and most recently discussed his career in an interview with Papers from the Institute of Archaeology.\n\nIn 2012, Parker Pearson left the University of Sheffield and began teaching at the Institute of Archaeology, University College London, as Professor of British Later Prehistory.\n\nOn 16 July 2015, he was elected a Fellow of the British Academy (FBA).\n\n\n"}

Iguerbouchen (Francophile name), Mohamed Ygerbuchen (as screen credited), Mohamed Ben Saïd Iquerbouchen, ; (13 November 1907 – 23 August 1966) was an Algerian composer.\n\nMohamed Iguerbouchène was the oldest of 14 children born to Saïd ben Ali and Sik Fatma bent Areski. He attended a primary school in Algiers. For his secondary education, he claimed to have studied music theory at a Norton College, in London. When he was 15, he crossed paths with Earl Fraser Roth, who found himself inspired by the obvious talent of the young Mohamed and decided to help him in his further studies. In 1922, with the generosity of Fraser Ross, Mohamed traveled to Manchester, where he enrolled in the Royal Manchester College of Music.\n\nIguerbouchène attended the prestigious Imperial Academy of Music in 1924 in Vienna for one year. In 1925, at the age of 18, he performed his first concert in Bregenz, Lake Constance. He exhibited his talent chaining works of his own directory like \"Kabylia Rapsodie n. 9\" and \"Arabic rapsodie n. 7\". The culmination of his early years of work resulted in his winning his first prize of harmony, counterpoint, and piano instrumentation. In 1934, after several successful symphonies, Mohamed was introduced to the Société des auteurs, compositeurs et éditeurs de musique (SACEM) as a songwriter, and in that same year he was also introduced as a member of the Société des Auteurs et Compositeurs Dramatiques (SACD).\n\nIguerbouchène was fluent in 18 languages including Russian and Japanese. In France, at the école normale des langues orientales de Paris, he was a student of Professor Destaing, where he studied Tamahaq, Tachawit and Tashelhit.\n\nAfter some time, Iguerbouchène shifted his focus to compose for the cinema as opposed to symphonic music. After a few documentaries (Aziza) and a short film (Dzair), Julien Duvivier asked him to collaborate for the soundtrack of \"Pépé le Moko\", a film whose main role was played by Jean Gabin. This film was the catalyst behind Mohamed's career as a film composer. The two artists shared the composition of the soundtrack in association with Vincent Scotto. (On the film's credits his name appeared as \"Mohamed Ygerbuchen\".)\n\nIn 1938, he met the singer Salim Halali in Paris (who was originally from Annaba), who helped Mohamed to compose fifty songs, mainly in an Arabic Flamenco style. The collaboration was successful in Parisian clubs and they also toured the rest of Europe. They were in particular very popular in North Africa.\n\nFollowing his approach to the BBC, in 1939 it broadcast one of his orchestral works, a 'Moorish Rhapsody', which was conducted by Charles Brill. Some listeners thought that he was a Russian composer, which earned him the nickname Igor Bouchen. In 1938, he composed songs with Vincent Scotto for the film \"Algiers\". Because of Iguerbouchène's success in music direction, he was hired in 1940 by Paris Mondial to compose music for 20 short films for Mercier Film Inc. film studios. In early 1945, he composed about 100 songs based on poems in Thousands Nights by Rabindranath Tagore. In 1946, he composed music for, \"Les plongeurs du désert\" by Tahar Hannache.\n\nIguerbouchène composed for the 1962 French short \"Le songe de chevaux sauvages\", directed by Albert Lamorisse about wild horses in France.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "31972561", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=31972561", "title": "Nahum Benari", "text": "Nahum Benari\n\nNahum Benari () (January 3, 1893 – December 24, 1963) was an Israeli writer and an intellectual. He is known mainly for promoting many Israeli cultural initiatives, primarily in the 1940s-50s, through his position as a member of the management body of the Histadrut (abbreviation for lit. The General Federation of Laborers in the Land of Israel).\n\nBenari was a prolific writer, who wrote on several subjects in various genres: treatises, pamphlets, plays, and more; about kibbutz and Zionist ideals and practices; about the making of ceremonies and festivals for Sabbath, holidays, and memorial days; about philosophy; and about stories and thoughts aroused by the day to day reality of the yishuv and Israel in its first years. Moreover, he translated books of other authors and edited books and journals. He was a man of creative imagination who could translate ideas and thoughts about culture and education into actions.\n\nBenari was born Nahum Brodski in 1893, in the Jewish part of the town of Lebedyn in Ukraine, then part of the Russian Empire. His father, Arie Leib, held a senior position at a sugar factory, and his mother, Devora, was a housewife; he was their firstborn of ten children. As an adolescent he was sent to learn in a yeshiva (a religious school), but the studies of Halakha (religious laws) didn't satisfy his curiosity. He moved from yeshiva to yeshiva across Ukraine until he arrived at Odessa, where he attended the yeshiva of Rabbi Chaim Tchernowitz (Rav Tza'ir) and graduated in 1911. Among his teachers in this yeshiva were well-known authors such as Hayim Nahman Bialik and Mendele Mocher Sforim, and there he absorbed Zionist values, which he passed on to his brothers and sisters.\n\nIn May 1914, a few months before the beginning of the First World War, Benari arrived in the Land of Israel, then part of the Ottoman Empire. During the first years after making Aliyah, he hired himself out as a farm worker, first at Degania and then at Ilaniya. In those years he became acquainted with immigrants of the Second Aliyah and Third Aliyah. He wrote the article \"HaKabtzanim HaSmechim\" (lit. The Happy Beggars) about this period. During this period he also met his first wife, Sonia Dubnov, with whom he had three children.\n\nAfter the First World War, at the time of the British Mandate for Palestine, he moved with his family to wherever he could find a job: he planted trees on Mount Carmel, served as a court clerk in Tel Aviv, and took on some temporary jobs in Jerusalem. While working as a court clerk he wrote the article \"Inyanei Beit Din\" (lit. court matters). During this period his brothers and sisters made Aliyah along with their mother; most of them settled in the rural Israeli settlements called Kibbutzim (plural of Kibbutz). In October 1922, after hearing of his father's death, he changed his surname to Benari (Hebrew: בֶּנאֲרִי, lit. lion's son); his brothers and sisters followed him in this act.\n\nAt the beginning of 1925, Benari and his family joined a kibbutz named Ein Harod. He worked in the fields and in the vineyard. At Ein Harod he was among those who conceived the Kibbutz's way of celebrating Jewish holidays. A main theme in the newly designed festivals and ceremonies was the agricultural year circle. For example, at Passover they established a ceremony for the beginning of the harvest, and at Shavuot a secular celebration of Bikkurim (Hebrew: ביכורים, lit. first fruits). Benari also edited the periodical MiBifnim (Hebrew: , lit. from the inside). The periodical of the kibbutzim organization HaKibbutz HaMeuchad (lit. the unified kibbutz or united kibbutz), stemmed from Ein Harod's journal. Benari lived in Ein Harod until 1942, and there he met his second wife, Yehudit Mensch, with whom he had one son.\n\nBenari was sent abroad on Hechalutz missions three times. In the years 1927-1929 he was sent by Ein Harod's leadership to Hechalutz center in Warsaw, Poland. During those two years, he lectured to and talked with young Jews in towns and Chavot Hachshara (lit. training farms), in Poland, Germany, Lithuania, and The Czech Republic. Additionally, he edited Hechalutz's journal called HeAtid (Hebrew: העתיד, lit. The Future). Between 1934-1936 he was sent for the second time by Ein Harod's leadership to the Hechalutz center in Warsaw, this time he also acted as a delegate to the 19th Zionist Congress at Lucerne, Switzerland. In the latter part of the Second World War, from October 1944 to January 1945, he went on his third mission. This time he was sent with two other men by Solel Boneh, a construction company, to join its work teams in the oil refineries in Abadan, Iran. Benari went as a social consultant, but he actually operated undercover as a Hechalutz emissary to encourage Zionist activity among the Jewish communities in Iran, Iraq, and Syria.\n\nAlongside performing missions abroad, Benari was also a pamphleteer of Hechalutz and the Zionist ideology.\n\nAt the beginning of 1942, Benari left Ein Harod with his family in order to focus on his cultural and educational activities. First he worked for Solel Boneh, but it wasn't long before he joined The Center of Culture and Education of the Histadrut. He was among the founders of Associations for Culture and Education (Hebrew: מפעלי תרבות וחינוך) and ran it for nearly twenty years. In this office he promoted many cultural initiatives by supplying funds and an organizational roof. Among the most eminent associations that were raised under his service were:\n\nAlongside enabling the formation of new cultural establishments, the Associations for Culture and Education, under Benari management, also supported existing foundations such as HaOhel Theater (Hebrew: האהל, lit. The Tent), The Israeli Opera, Inbal Dance Theater, and Am Oved publishing house.\n\n\n\n"}

He then became Chairman of the Ukrainian Parliament until 27 November 2014. Turchynov also served as acting Prime Minister in 2010 (when he was the First Vice Prime Minister in the absence of a prime minister after Yulia Tymoshenko's government was dismissed on 3 March 2010) until the Verkhovna Rada (Ukrainian parliament) appointed Mykola Azarov as Prime Minister on 11 March 2010. In 2005, Turchynov served as the head of the Security Service of Ukraine.\n\nTurchynov was the first deputy chairman of the political party Batkivshchyna (All-Ukrainian Union \"Fatherland\") and a close associate of party leader Yulia Tymoshenko. He started the new political party People's Front in September 2014, now together with Prime Minister Arseniy Yatsenyuk.\n\nOleksandr Turchynov was born in Dnipropetrovsk. He graduated from the Dnipropetrovsk Metallurgical Institute in 1986, after which he worked at Kryvorizhstal, a large Ukrainian steel producer. From 1987 to 1990, he served as head of the agitation and propaganda division of the Dnipropetrovsk Oblast Komsomol (Communist Youth League) Committee, which was led by Serhiy Tihipko. Tihipko and Turchynov became political advisers of Leonid Kuchma, then head of Dnipropetrovsk-based Pivdenmash missile manufacturer. Kuchma and his entire team, including Tihipko and Turchynov moved to Kiev in 1992, after Kuchma was appointed Prime Minister.

They used to have a common business in Dnipropetrovsk. In December 1993, Turchynov co-founded and became Vice President of Ukrainian Union of Industrialist and Entrepreneurs. In 1994 he created the political party Hromada together with Pavlo Lazarenko, a business ally of Tymoshenko. Turchynov was also director of the Economic Reforms Institute from January 1994 to March 1998 and was head of the Ukrainian National Academy of Sciences' Laboratory of Shadow Economy Research.\n\nIn 1998, he was elected to parliament as a member of Hromada but after the scandal around Lazarenko, he left the faction and party (during May 1999) together with Yulia Tymoshenko's All-Ukrainian Union \"Fatherland\". He was re-elected to parliament in 2002 and 2006 as part of the BYuT.\n\nOn 4 February 2005, Turchynov was appointed and served as the first‐ever civilian head of the Security Service of Ukraine (SBU). With the approval of Turchynov as the head of the SBU, he dissolved the investigation team that was investigating the Georgiy Gongadze case since 2002. According to the first deputy head of the Main Investigation Department of the Prosecutor General's Office of Ukraine Roman Shubin, Turchynov ordered not to provide operational data on the Gongadze case to the investigation group of the Security Service of Ukraine.\n\nIn August 2007, Turchynov replied to the accusation that his stance on same-sex marriage is typically conservative, \"I do not agree. If a man has normal views, then you label him a conservative, but those who use drugs or promote sodomy, you label them a progressive person.

On 11 March 2010 the Azarov Government was elected and Mykola Azarov was appointed Prime Minister the same day.\n\nAccording to WikiLeaks, the Prosecutor General of Ukraine Oleksandr Medvedko ordered former Minister of Internal Affairs Yuriy Lutsenko to arrest Yulia Tymoshenko's teammates – Oleksandr Turchynov and Andriy Kozhemiakin – for destroying the documents of the Security Service of Ukraine in which the connection between Tymoshenko and the criminal businessman Semion Mogilevich was proved.\n\nIn 2012 he was re-elected into parliament on the party list of \"Fatherland\".\n\nOn 22 February 2014, he was elected as speaker of Verkhovna Rada. On 23 February 2014, Turchynov was designated as acting President of Ukraine following the impeachment of Viktor Yanukovych. On 25 February Turchynov assumed the (Presidential power of) command of the Ukrainian Armed Forces.\n\nEarly March 2014 Vladimir Putin, President of the Russian Federation, stated he did not regard Turchynov as the legitimate Ukrainian President.\n\nOn 14 April 2014, while talking on the phone with Secretary-General Ban Ki Moon, Turchynov asked for the United Nations's support regarding the crisis in eastern Ukraine, to which the Secretary-General replied that peacekeepers may be sent in should Russia withhold its veto. Meanwhile, Turchynov issued a deadline to the pro-Russian insurgents to disarm and dismantle their barricades, but the deadline passed without incident. Before he issued a deadline, which was scheduled for 9 am, he tried to negotiate with insurgents and even proposed to hold referendum on the same day as elections which will be on 25 May. His proposition was questioned by journalists who feared that the referendum might be sabotaged by pro-Russia insurgents.\n\nOn 20 April 2014, Turchinov covertly ordered Dmytro Yarosh to lead 20 Right Sector members to sabotage a separatist-controlled television tower, leading to the first combat fatalities of the Siege of Sloviansk, according to an interview given by Dmytro Yarosh on 22 April 2016.\n\nPetro Poroshenko was elected President of Ukraine on 25 May 2014.

Indeed, we didn't check anyone at that time, if they were convicted previously or not – whoever said that they are ready to defend the country, signed up, received weapons and went to the East of our country.\"\n\nOn 21 September 2014, he said that Russia doesn't admits that their soldiers are fighting in Ukraine. He also stated that Russia is the main aggressor and that during the conflict his nation have lost over 1,000 lives with 100s missing. During the same Facebook message he compared the conflict to the butterflies, a metaphor to one of Ray Bradbury's works.\n\nTurchynov was elected his party's faction leader on 27 November 2014.\n\nOn 16 December 2014, President Poroshenko appointed Turchynov as Secretary of the National Security and Defence Council of Ukraine.\n\nAccording to the social poll of the \"Sofia\" centre, in June 2017, only 0.9% of respondents said that they completely trust Turchynov, 9.5% trust him, 24.1% do not trust him, 57.4% do not trust him at all.\n\nOn 10 September 2014, Oleksandr Turchynov published a letter in which he urged retailers to take a closer look at the products of \"Tarasove Dzherelo\", a small producer of mineral water. He proposed to conclude deals with that company. Some market experts assessed the actions of Turchinov as lobbyism.\n\nAccording to the journalistic investigation, Turchinov's mother-in-law, Tamara Beliba, owns the largest data center in the Baltic states — \"MC-office\". Beliba owns the \"Ekonomikos Institutas\" company, which owns a data center located in Kaunas, Lithuania. The total volume of investments was $200 million. Tamara Beliba is also the owner of the company \"Ekostilkom\", which in turn owns a house near Kiev with a size of 1,000 m² with a plot of land of 0.5 hectares. Turchynov's mother-in-law is the owner of warehouses with a total area of 6,000 m² in Kiev on the Akademika Koroleva Prospect. Another company of Tamara Beliba owns three facilities with the size of more than 200 m² each in the centre of Kiev on Konovalets street.\n\nAccording to the \"United State Register of Legal Entities, Individual Entrepreneurs and Public Organizations\" of Ukraine, the entire business in the Turchynov family is executed on his mother-in-law Tamara Beliba, mother Valentina and wife Anna. The family is engaged in economic research, film production, providing communication services and building data centres. This business is related with economic research, film production, the provision of telecommunications services and data centers.\n\nOn 1 May 2017, the journalistic investigation of the program \"Our money with Denis Bigus\" (channel \"24\") proved the connection between Oleksandr Turchynov and people's deputy Ruslan Lukyanchuk with three large companies (\"Absolut Finance\", \"Magnate\" and \"Octave Finance\") that own 1,200 exchange points of 3,500 legal currency exchange offices in Ukraine. These points exchanged currencies without cash registers, which violates the requirements of the law, since in this case automatic tax reporting is not provided to the State Fiscal Service. All these companies are listed on the nominees — Oksana and Ilona Brodovskaya and Hryhoriy Pron'ko (Oksana's father). However, their connection with the joint business of Turchinov and Lukyanchuk was proved by journalists — Oksana and her husband Valentin Brodovsky were assistants of Ruslan Lukyanchuk during four convocations of the Verkhovna Rada. Investigations on this subject were published in the Ukrainian media earlier.\n\nOleksandr Turchynov's father-in-law Vladimir Beliba together with businessman Ihor Tynnyy opened in 2013 in the center of Kiev a restaurant of Italian cuisine \"Montecchi v Capuleti\". This was reported in May 2016 by the journalists of \"Nashi hroshi\" project.\n\nAccording to media reports, Turchynov is involved in establishment of the following companies: \"Institute for Economic Reforms\" LLC, \"Information Technologies of the 21st Century\" CJSC, \"Pharmacor\" LLC, \"ZET\" LLC, \"Europe-X\" LLC, \"Editorial board of Vecherniye Vesti newspaper\" LLC, \"VV\" LLC, \"SVV\" LLC, \"Janus\" Real Estate Agency LLC.\n\nIn June 2003, the Deputy Prosecutor General of Ukraine Viktor Shokin announced his intention to send the proposal to the Ukrainian Parliament an idea to bringing to trial the deputies Alexander Turchinov, Stepan Khmara and Nikolai Rudkovsky. According to Shokin, the People's deputies were insulting and beating the staff of the Lukyanivska Prison. Deputies demanded the release of Gennady Tymoshenko and Antonina Bolyura. They were incriminated with three cases of the Criminal code: \"Capturing state buildings\", \"Threat to law enforcement officers\", and \"Excess of power with the use of weapons and verbal insulting of law enforcement officers.\"\n\nOn September 13, 2003, tax officials detained at the office of the \"Fatherland\" party Ruslan Lukyanchuk, one of the assistants of Oleksandr Turchynov. He was charged with involvement in illegal currency exchange. The Prosecutor General of Ukraine Svyatoslav Piskun then stated that the detention of Turchynov's assistant was part of a planned process of initiating a criminal case. According to Piskun, about hundreds of thousands of illegally converted dollars were sent to the office of the \"Fatherland\" party.\n\nIn February 2006 state prosecutors opened a criminal case against Turchynov and his SBU deputy Andriy Kozhemyakin for destroying a file about FBI Ten Most Wanted Fugitive, organized crime boss Semyon Mogilevich, from the SBU archive. The case was dismissed four months later. WikiLeaks documents mention Turchynov, then head of Ukraine's SBU, as having destroyed documents implicating Yulia Tymoshenko's alleged connections to Mogilevich.\n\nAccording to the \"Komsomolskaya Pravda in Ukraine\" newspaper referring to deputy mayor of Kiev Leonid Chernovetskyi, Mr. Turchynov is related to unlawful construction in the Landscape Valley (\"Peyzazhna aleya\") district of Kiev. In autumn of 2004 the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Ukraine signed an investment contract with JSC \"Ukrainian Property\" (OAO \"Ukrayinsʹke mayno\") on the construction of an apartment building in this district. With this the share of the MFA in the project made just 20%. The Ministry actually became a cover for the businessmen. As of the 1 January 2007, 91.1% of the JSC \"Ukrainian Property\" shares belonged to \"Eclad Invest Ltd.\" (USA), and 8.2% to Valery Kovalenko. Previously, the shares of JSC \"Ukrainian Property\" belonged to JSC \"Financial holding \"L-Holding\"\", the largest shareholder of which was JSC \"Centre of Financial Technologies\". Oleksandr Turchinov owned 26.2% of the shares of this company. On April 23, 2008, the Kiev District Administrative Court ruled that Oleksandr Turchinov had no personal relationship with the construction of the Landscape Valley.\n\nIn 2005, Oleksandr Turchinov ordered to organize an illegal wiretapping of the journalist of \"Segodnya\" newspaper Oleksandr Korchinsky. This fact was made public at a press conference by Viktor Shokin, former Prosecutor General of Ukraine. The telephone of the journalist was tapped from June 25 to July 12, 2005. Turchinov personally took this decision. The journalist's phone was bugged without sanctions of the court. On 14 March 2006, the Prosecutor General's Office of Ukraine have opened a criminal case on the fact of illegal wiretapping of senior officials. Most of these wiretapping took place in 2005, when Oleksandr Turchynov was the head of SSU.\n\nIn August 2016, journalists of the \"Economichna Pravda\" (\"Ukrayinska Pravda\" project) accused Oleksandr Turchinov of influencing the leadership of the State Special Communications Service of Ukraine (DSTSZI). Despite the introduction of the system of electronic declarations on the incomes of civil servants and officials, those declarations without a DSTSZI's security certificate could not have legal force in court cases. A number of analysts accused Turchinov of disrupting the launch of the e-declaration system.\n\nOn 15 August 2016, Serhiy Kaplin, Secretary of the Committee for National Security and Defense of the Verkhovna Rada, published an open appeal to the National Anti-Corruption Bureau of Ukraine and the Prosecutor General demanding to confirm the attitude of Oleksandr Turchinov to private arms manufacturers. Turchinov actively lobbies the entry of these manufacturers to the market. Kaplin also demands the Prosecutor General to open cases against Turchynov and Serhiy Pashynskyi on the surrender of Crimea and Donbass.\n\nIn March 2017, former people's deputy Oleksandr Shepelev accused Turchinov and Ruslan Lukyanchuk of stealing and withdrawing $800 million from the state budget with the assistance of the International Monetary Fund. According to Shepelev, in 2009 Turchinov and Lukyanchuk \"were taxed by the heads of ministries and state enterprises\", and received money from them to the accounts of the \"European Bank for Rational Financing\" (EBRD). There, hryvnias were converted into the cash dollars, which then were withdrawn to offshores through the Baltic banks and shell companies. The largest of these companies was \"Fortex\", owned by Lukyanchuk and registered in the UK. Turchinov urged the NABU to investigate the charges against him.\n\nAccording to the Ukrainian lawyer living in Russia and disgraced former First Deputy Prosecutor General of Ukraine Renat Kuzmin, the court ordered National Anti-Corruption Bureau of Ukraine to initiate the criminal proceedings against Turchynov for theft and withdrawal of $800 million to offshore companies. The NSDC press service said that Kuzmin's publication contains false information that \"Russian secret services are replicating in order to discredit the Secretary of the Turchinov Council.\" Turchynov later appealed to the State Financial Monitoring Service of Ukraine and the National Anti-Corruption Bureau with a request to conduct a check of the statements of the former members of the Yanukovych team hiding out in Russia that he withdrew $ 800 million from the state budget to the offshore.\n\nIn 2004 Turchynov published a book \"Illusion of Fear\". In 2005 he also wrote a script to the same name movie that is based on the book. The movie was released in Ukraine in September 2008 and was the 2008 Ukrainian submissions for the Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film.\n\nAccording to the electronic declaration, in 2016, Oleksandr Turchinov received 512,807 hryvnias (US$19,618) as salary in the Verkhovna Rada. He received interest of 1.7 million hryvnias (US$65,034) from bank deposits. Another 22.8 thousand hryvnias formed an income from the alienation of securities and corporate rights. On bank accounts, Turchinov had 49.8 thousand hryvnias, US$810.4 thousand, and about € 10 thousand. He also declared US$735 thousand, €55 thousand, and 320 thousand hryvnias in cash. Additionally, Turchinov had a collection of ancient Bibles, 12 paintings, as well as copyrights to books and films. His spouse has declared 447.5 thousand grivnas of income.\n\nOn 31 October 2014, at the ceremony of rewarding the participants of the special operation in Donbass, the head of the Ministry of Internal Affairs of Ukraine Arsen Avakov awarded Oleksandr Turchinov a compact self-loading pistol PSM-05 for services to the ministry. The Minister expressed the hope that he will assist the Ministry in the future.\n\nTurchinov also has three more award weapons - a revolver of \"Alfa 3541\" caliber .357 Magnum (30 April 2014), a pistol machine gun \"Fort-226\" (30 March 2015), and a semi-automatic pistol \"Mauser C96\" with 105 bullets.\n\nIn May 2016, Minister of Internal Affairs of Ukraine Arsen Avakov confirmed that Turchinov was awarded the Maxim's machine gun model 1910 (PM M1910).\n\nOn 2 May 2018, by the decree of the President of Ukraine, he was awarded the Order of Prince Yaroslav the Wise of the Fifth Class.\n\nHis wife is Hanna Turchynova (born 1970), PhD, dean of the faculty of natural geography and ecology at National Pedagogical Dragomanov University. They have one son, Kyrylo (born 1994), a student that finished his master's degree thesis in 2014.\n\nTurchynov is known for abstaining from tobacco and alcohol. He is part of the 1.9% of Ukraine's population that identify as being Protestant. Although some in the media have reported that he is a pastor, the Associated Baptist Press and the European Baptist Federation report that he is an elder and occasional lay preacher at his Kiev church, the Word of Life Center, which is a member of the Evangelical Baptist Union of Ukraine. In social networks he received the nickname \"Bloody Pastor\". He treats with irony to this nickname: \"I think this nickname is much better than what the Ukrainians gave to Putin\". Also, Turchynov is occasionally considered by some media as the \"Consigliere of Yulia Tymoshenko\".\n"}

Deen resides in Savannah, Georgia, where she owns and operates The Lady & Sons restaurant and Paula Deen's Creek House with her sons, Jamie and Bobby Deen. She has published fifteen cookbooks. Though married since 2004 to Michael Groover, she uses the last name Deen, from her first marriage.\n\nDeen was born Paula Ann Hiers in Albany, Georgia, the daughter of Corrie A. Hiers (née Paul) and Earl Wayne Hiers, Sr. She grew up Baptist, and is still deeply devoted to her faith. Her parents died before she was 23, and an early marriage ended in divorce. In her 20s, Deen suffered from panic attacks and agoraphobia. She then focused on cooking for her family as something she could do without leaving her house. Her grandmother Irene Paul had taught her the hand-me-down art of Southern cooking; one of the only places she felt safe was at her own stove, making thousands of pots of chicken and dumplings. She later moved to Savannah, Georgia, with her sons. In 1989, she divorced her husband, Jimmy Deen, to whom she had been married since 1965. She was left with only $200 and money was tight raising both her kids and her younger brother, Earl (\"Bubba\"). She tried hanging wallpaper, working as a bank teller, and selling real estate and insurance. She then started a catering service, making sandwiches and meals, which her sons Jamie and Bobby delivered.\n\nDeen's home business, The Bag Lady, soon outgrew her kitchen. She first moved into the Best Western on Savannah's southside on Abercorn Street in 1991 with a restaurant called The Lady. In January 1996, Deen opened her restaurant, The Lady & Sons, in downtown Savannah, on West Congress Street. Within a few years, the restaurant moved to the old White Hardware building on Whitaker. \"USA Today\" named The Lady & Sons the \"International Meal of the Year\" in 1999. The specialty is a buffet of Southern \"comfort foods\".\nEvery buffet meal includes a salad bar and one dessert. Her sons are also involved in managing the restaurant, which is popular with tourists visiting Savannah. Deen owned four casino buffets; they were at Harrah's Casino Tunica in Mississippi, Harrah's Cherokee casino in North Carolina, Horseshoe Southern Indiana, and Harrah's Joliet in Illinois. They were rebranded in 2013 shortly after Deen was removed from the Food Network.\n\nIn September 2009, Deen announced a new dessert line to be sold at Walmart including signature pies Apple Crunch Top, Dark Rum Pecan, Old Fashioned Fudge and St. Louis style Gooey Butter Cake bars. In addition to these, Deen co-owned Uncle Bubba's Oyster House in Savannah Georgia. It underwent an \"abrupt closure\" on April 4, 2014 with a spokesperson saying that there were discussions about development of the waterfront property. The property will reopen in June 2017 as Paula Deen’s Creek House and will be a joint venture of Deen and her two sons. On April 27, 2015, Deen opened Paula Deen's Family Kitchen, her new restaurant and retail concept, in Pigeon Forge, Tennessee. On January 25, 2016, the city of Myrtle Beach, South Carolina received an application for a building permit for a two-story Paula Deen's Family Kitchen, to replace the 20-year-old Carlos 'n Charlie's at Broadway at the Beach. In June 2017, Paula Deen opened her Myrtle Beach location. In November 2017, Deen announced that two new Paula Deen restaurants would open in Texas. One location in Dallas is set to open in Spring 2018 and the San Antonio location will open 6–8 weeks later.\n\nIn 1997, Deen self-published \"The Lady & Sons Savannah Country Cookbook\" and \"The Lady & Sons, Too! A Whole New Batch of Recipes from Savannah \". Both cookbooks featured traditional Southern recipes. She has since published two more, written with Martha Nesbit. Deen has appeared on QVC and on \"The Oprah Winfrey Show\" (first in 2002, twice in 2007 and once in 2010). Her life story is featured in \"Extraordinary Comebacks: 201 Inspiring Stories of Courage, Triumph, and Success\" (2007, Sourcebooks). In April 2007, Simon & Schuster published Deen's memoir, \"It Ain't All About the Cookin\"'. She launched a lifestyle magazine called \"Cooking with Paula Deen\" in November 2005, which claimed a circulation of 7.5 million in March 2009. In 2015, Paula Deen Ventures signed a distribution agreement with Hachette Client Services for future cookbooks.\n\nDeen's relationship with Food Network began in 1999, when her friend Erin Lewis introduced her to Gordon Elliott, who then introduced her to her then agent, Artist's Agency owner Barry Weiner. Elliott took her through the city for a series of \"Doorknock Dinners\" episodes. She also appeared on \"Ready, Set, Cook!\". Deen was invited to shoot a pilot named \"Afternoon Tea\" in early 2001. The network liked it, and eventually gave Deen her own show, \"Paula's Home Cooking\", which premiered in November 2002. \"Paula's Home Cooking\" was originally taped in Millbrook, New York at the home of Gordon Elliott, the show's executive producer. Deen mentioned on the March 13, 2006, edition of \"The Daily Buzz\" that the next batch of episodes of her show would be taped at her home in Savannah, Georgia. According to the first of those episodes, actual production at her new Savannah home began in November 2005.\n\nSince then, Deen has been given two more Food Network shows, \"Paula's Party\" and \"Paula's Best Dishes\". \"Paula's Party\" premiered on the Food Network in 2006 and \"Paula's Best Dishes\" debuted on June 8, 2008. A televised biography of Deen was aired on an episode of the Food Network's \"Chefography\" program, in March 2006.\n\nOn June 21, 2013, due to a controversy regarding Deen's admission, during a deposition for a lawsuit, that she had used racial slurs in a social media post, The Food Network announced they will not renew her contract. It was announced that on September 24, 2014 Paula will unveil her very own network. The network is said to be a full digital experience that lets users access Paula's southern cooking on computer, smartphones and tablets. On March 11, 2015, it was announced that Deen had kicked off her \"comeback\" with the launch of the all-new Paula Deen Channel on Roku. On September 2, 2015, Deen was announced as one of the celebrities to compete on the 21st season of \"Dancing with the Stars\". She was paired with professional dancer Louis van Amstel. The couple was eliminated in the sixth week of competition, finishing in 9th place overall. In October 2016, Deen launched a syndicated television show, Positively Paula. The Celebrity Chef also appears regularly on the home shopping network, Evine. Deen sells a wide variety of merchandise on Evine including, kitchen appliances, food products, clothing and more.\n\nIn 2004, Deen married Michael Groover (born 1956), a tugboat captain in the Port of Savannah, Georgia. Deen has two children from a previous marriage. The wedding was featured in a Food Network show in 2004 and took place at Bethesda Academy in Savannah. On 21 July 2018 Michael Groover won the Hemingway Look-Alike Contest on his ninth try.\n\nPaula is a supporter of Bethesda Academy, and asked Old Savannah Tours to donate $1 to the organization for each ticket purchased for the Paula Deen Store ticket sale.\n\nDeen made her film debut in \"Elizabethtown\" (2005), starring Orlando Bloom and Kirsten Dunst. She played the aunt of Bloom's character, and her cooking was featured. A Food Network special, \"Paula Goes Hollywood\", aired in conjunction with the film's premiere. In 2015, Deen joined the cast of ABC's \"Dancing with the Stars\". She was eliminated during the sixth week.\n\nIn June 2007, Deen won a Daytime Emmy Award (Outstanding Lifestyle Host) for \"Paula's Home Cooking\". In October 2010, she was selected as the Grand Marshal of the Tournament of Roses Parade, and presided over the 2011 Rose Parade before the Rose Bowl Game on January 1, 2011.\n\nDeen has faced extensive criticism for the high amounts of fat, salt, and sugar in her recipes. She faced particularly strong objections with the release of \"Cookbook for the Lunch-Box Set\", a cookbook aimed at children, with Barbara Walters saying of the book, \"You tell kids to have cheesecake for breakfast. You tell them to have chocolate cake and meatloaf for lunch. And french fries. Doesn't it bother you that you're adding to this?\" Celebrity chef Anthony Bourdain commented in 2011 that he \"would think twice before telling an already obese nation that it's OK to eat food that is killing us\". On January 17, 2012, Deen announced that she had been diagnosed with Type 2 diabetes three years before. It was also disclosed that Deen is a paid spokesperson for the Danish pharmaceutical company Novo Nordisk. She was called a hypocrite for continuing to promote her high-fat and sugar diet while disclosing her medical condition only when it benefited her in representing the drug company to market their diabetes management program.\n\nIn June 2013, Deen was the target of a lawsuit alleging racial and sexual discrimination filed by Lisa Jackson. It alleged that Deen made derogatory remarks regarding African Americans in the presence of Jackson, whose nieces are half black. Jackson also alleged that Deen mused about wedding plans for her brother with a \"true Southern plantation-style theme\" with black male servers but rejected the plans \"because the media would be on me about that\" (Deen denied having used the \"N-word\" when discussing the wedding waitstaff). The case was heard in August 2013, with the judge dismissing the suit with prejudice, meaning it cannot be re-filed. Both sides agreed to dismiss the lawsuit \"without any award of costs or fees to any party\".\nDeen stated in her deposition that she had used the \"N-word\" at times. Specifically, she recalled telling her husband about an incident \"when a black man burst into the bank that I was working at and put a gun to my head. ... I didn't feel real favorable towards him.\" Asked if she had used the word since then, she said: \"I'm sure I have, but it's been a very long time [...] maybe in repeating something that was said to me ... probably a conversation between blacks. I don't – I don't know. But that's just not a word that we use as time has gone on. Things have changed since the '60s in the south.\"\n\nIn the time between the filing of the suit and the suit being dismissed, Deen had cookery programs, publishing deals and endorsement contracts cancelled by Food Network, Smithfield Foods, Walmart, Target, QVC, Caesars Entertainment, Novo Nordisk, J.C. Penney, Sears, Kmart and her then-publisher Ballantine Books; however, several companies have expressed their intent to continue their endorsement deals with Deen. During the same time, sales of Deen's cookbooks soared. Former US President Jimmy Carter urged that Deen be forgiven, stating, \"I think she has been punished, perhaps overly severely, for her honesty in admitting it and for the use of the word in the distant past. She's apologized profusely.\"\n\nIn July 2015, Deen faced controversy over a Halloween picture from 2011 in which Paula was dressed as Lucy Ricardo played by Lucille Ball while her son Bobby was dressed as Lucy's husband Ricky Ricardo in dark brownface makeup along with Gordon Elliott who was not in his costume as her social media manager who was responsible was fired for it. The photo was taken from a holiday-themed episode of her former Food Network show \"Paula's Best Dishes\" with a tweet mimicking Arnaz's accented English on the show with \"Lucyyyyyyy!, You got a lot of esplanin' to do!\", was quickly removed Tuesday from her Twitter account after it drew a flurry of negative comments about Bobby Deen's dark-skinned depiction of the character played by Desi Arnaz Lucille's TV and real-life husband, Arnaz himself was a Cuban-born Hispanic. In a statement, a spokesman for Ms. Deen, Jaret Keller, blames a social media manager for posting the image to Twitter. It was stated that \"Paula immediately had this picture taken down as soon as she saw this post and apologizes to all who were offended\". Mr. Keller said in this statement \"As such, Paula's ventures has terminated their relationship with this social media manager\". On Wednesday, Keller declined to identify the fired social media manager.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "510328", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=510328", "title": "Roronoa Zoro", "text": "Roronoa Zoro\n\n, nicknamed , is a fictional character in the \"One Piece\" franchise created by Eiichiro Oda.\n\nIn the story, Zoro is the first to join Monkey D. Luffy after he is saved from being executed at the Marine Base. He is one of the two swordsmen of the Straw Hat Pirates, the other being Brook. As a native to the East Blue, he came from the town known as Shimotsuki, where he trained in a dojo and learned the one and two-sword styles (ittōryū and nitōryū). Zoro is uniquely known as an expert of Santōryū (Three Sword Style), where he wields a third sword with his mouth in combat. Throughout the series, his primary sword is Wado Ichimonji, a sword that he inherited from a childhood friend, and is frequently the sword that he wields in his mouth.\n\nZoro first appears in the manga chapter , first published in Japan's \"Weekly Shōnen Jump\" magazine on August 18, 1997. He first appears as a captured criminal awaiting his execution at the hands of the Marines. Before the beginning of the series' narrative, Zoro loses his childhood friend Kuina and vows to get strong.\n\nFor years, he hunts pirates only to get money for food in the company of his friends Johnny and Yosaku. When Luffy offers Zoro to join his crew, he initially refuses. However, after Zoro is saved from being executed by Captain Morgan, he joins Luffy. When he discovers that the best swordsman in the world is Dracule Mihawk, Zoro thinks only to beat him one day. However, he is defeated at Mihawk's hands.\n\nAfter fighting Daz Bonez in Alabasta, Zoro's bounty is initially set at 60,000,000, but is later raised to 120,000,000 after fighting the World Government at Enies Lobby. Later, the crew is separated by Bartholomew Kuma. Zoro encounters Mihawk again, and trains under him before reuniting two years later. He receives a bounty of 320,000,000 after defeating Pica.\n\nZoro commonly wears a plain white shirt (though he can be seen wearing other types of shirts), black pants, and a light-green, haramaki sash that holds his three swords. Zoro also has a black bandanna tied around his left bicep that he only wears on his head while in a serious battle. Under his shirt, his torso is heavily scarred from many of the battles he has fought, especially since he joined the Straw Hats (like the one acquired during the battle against Dracule Mihawk, one of the Seven Warlords of the Sea). He has three golden ear rings in his left ear which denotes his three swords style. Eventually, Zoro has a scar across his left eye (and appears to have lost that eye) and replaces his shirt with a long dark green samurai's coat which he can even open the torso part while fighting (against the New Fishman Pirates) or when he experiences heat (burning side of Punk Hazard).\n\nZoro is confident, but often acts in a very comical manner. A running gag is that he has a terrible sense of direction which he is very insecure about since he never admits it when he gets lost, instead always blaming someone else. While the crew is out at sea, Zoro can be found (usually) sleeping or training towards his goal of becoming the world's best swordsman. He and Sanji have a great rivalry, often resorting to fighting (both verbally and physically) over issues from minor to extreme.\n\nThough not a samurai, he appears to maintain a certain degree of bushido, and is frequently mistaken for one. Unlike Luffy and most of the other Straw Hat pirates, Zoro has been known to kill his opponents if he has to, though never in cold blood. It is shown that Zoro enjoys fighting a strong opponent (usually left to face down the second strongest villain in each arc, as Luffy faces down the strongest). When battling a worthy opponent Zoro tends to retain a maniacal grin and serious glare throughout.\n\nZoro has a stern, serious and distanced personality, but unlike Robin, he often reacts in a goofy and exaggerated comic style due to his short-tempered and impatient attitude. On the ship, he normally either trains with weights or sleeps. The only work he is seen doing regularly is hoisting the anchor using his great strength and maintaining look out in the ships crow's nest (which on the Thousand Sunny ship also doubles as his personal gym). He also likes sake, almost to the degree that Luffy likes meat, but like Nami, he never gets drunk due to his inhumanly-high endurance and tolerance for alcohol. Another notable trait is his lack of orientation, as Zoro often gets lost, even in small, familiar spaces or when being led by someone. Despite this, he is often the first to sense an enemy or danger, and the first to react. He is often displayed being well aware of dangerous situations and people around him.\n\nZoro often also reminds others of the harsh facts, which often shocks some of the other crew members, although they usually decide he is right. Zoro is an atheist, because he stated that he does not pray to any god, and has never believed in anything except himself. Even so, Zoro knows that he still has a lot of untapped potential, and is constantly seen training and trying to improve his fighting skills. He also adheres to a strict sword master's code of honor, and never falsely brags or lies about his abilities, sometimes outright admitting a weakness, even to an enemy. He also never tries to escape from a fight or use trickery to win, believing that doing so is cowardly and scorning anyone who uses such tactics. Zoro is very vigorous, strong-willed and determined.\n\nRelated to his fighting/manly spirit, Zoro has a lot of scars on his body. The most noticeable is the long scar running down his left eye which is the one he got after he came back from the 2 year time skip, which is currently unknown how he acquired it, all we know is that he can't open his left eye because of it. \nHe also has a heavily scarred torso having a diagonal cut mark from top to bottom of his torso by Dracule Mihawk. He also has scars on both of his ankles which he obtained from trying to cut his own legs off in order to escape the candle prison of Mr. 3 in Little Garden.\n\nIn the original Japanese version of the \"One Piece\" anime series, Zoro is voiced by Kazuya Nakai as an adult and Megumi Urawa as a child.\n\nIn Odex's dub of the first 104 episodes of \"One Piece\" in Singapore, Zoro was voiced by Brian Zimmerman. In 4Kids Entertainment's dub of the first five-story arcs of \"One Piece\", Marc Diraison voiced adult Zoro and Andrew Rannells voiced child Zoro. In Funimation Entertainment's dub of the entire \"One Piece\" franchise, adult Zoro is voiced by Christopher Sabat with Cynthia Cranz playing the role of child Zoro for episode 2 and by Brina Palencia for the rest of the franchise.\nIn the game \"\", Sabat reprises his role as adult Zoro, with child Zoro voiced by Aaron Dismuke.\n\nZoro ranked second in the first four \"Shōnen Jump\" character popularity polls, and ranked third in the fifth one, after Trafalgar Law. Furthermore, in a 2007 poll by Oricon, Zoro was voted as the 4th most desired character to receive a spinoff. DVD Talk praises Zoro's \"hilarious\" three-sword fighting style as a great example of the show's sense of humor. Holly Ellingwood from Activeanime praised Zoro's fight against Luffy as one of the best moments from the 10th DVD from the series released by Viz Media, praising the action scenes. Sabat's work with Zoro has resulted in him being a nominated of the category \"Best Voice Actor (English)\" in the Society for the Promotion of Japanese Animation (SPJA) Awards from 2008. Carl Kimlinger of Anime News Network commented on Sabat's work with Zoro as a \"standout\", noting that Zoro and Sabat are \"well-matched. Kimlinger also found that his and Sanji's flashbacks from the anime \"really do jerk tears, even if they are less than gracefully executed\".\n"}

She admitted during an interview published in the June 1973 edition of \"Star\" Magazine that she was closely acquainted with Iggy Pop, Mick Jagger, Rod Stewart, Alice Cooper, David Bowie, and Marc Bolan.\n\nStarr first attended concerts around Los Angeles with older friends who had dropped out of school in late 1968. She claims to have lost her virginity at age 12 with Spirit guitarist Randy California after a gig at Topanga, California. She had a younger sister, Corel Shields (born 1959), who according to Chris Charlesworth was involved with Iggy Pop in Autumn 1973, when Corel was 13-14. Pop later immortalized his involvement with Starr herself in the 1996 song \"Look Away.\" It refers to Sable being thirteen, which would be in 1970.\nI slept with Sable when she was 13,\nHer parents were too rich to do anything, \nShe rocked her way around L.A.,\n'Til a New York Doll carried her away…\n\nStarr became one of the first \"baby groupies\" who in the early 1970s frequented the Rainbow Bar and Grill, the Whiskey A Go Go, and Rodney Bingenheimer's English Disco; these were trendy nightclubs on West Hollywood's Sunset Strip. The girls were named as such because of their young age. She got started after a friend invited her to the Whiskey A Go Go at the age of 14. Starr later described herself at that period as having been \"nuts to begin with. I always liked getting into trouble\". She had considered herself unattractive, so she had a nose job when she was 15. During the time Starr was a groupie, she continued to live at home with her family and attended Palos Verdes High School to placate her parents.\n\nIn 1973 she gave a candid interview for the short-lived Los Angeles-based \"Star Magazine\", and boasted to the journalist that she considered herself to be \"the best\" of all the local groupies. She also claimed that she was closely acquainted with some of rock music's leading musicians, such as Jeff Beck, David Bowie, Mick Jagger, Rod Stewart, Marc Bolan, and Alice Cooper. She added that her favorite rock star acquaintance was Led Zeppelin's lead singer, Robert Plant. When asked how she attracted the attention of the musicians, she maintained it was because of the outrageous glam rock clothing she habitually wore. She was often photographed alongside well-known rock musicians; these photos appeared in American rock magazines such as \"Creem\" and \"Rock Scene\".\n\nStarr admitted to having gotten into fights with rival groupies and she allegedly had a confrontation with Bianca Jagger, who at the time was married to Rolling Stones frontman Mick Jagger. According to Starr, she knocked on Bianca's hotel room and when the latter opened the door she was told \"in a few four-letter words to 'get lost'\". Lori Mattix, a fellow baby groupie, claimed that Starr once told her to \"keep her hands\" off of Jimmy Page, saying \"if you touch him, I will shoot you. He’s mine.” Her closest friends in Los Angeles were fellow groupies Shray Mecham and \"Queenie\". Model Bebe Buell described Starr as having been one of the two top Los Angeles groupies of the era, adding that \"every rock star who came to Los Angeles wanted to meet her\".\n\nShe ran away from home when she was 16 after meeting Johnny Thunders, guitarist in the glam rock band the New York Dolls. She went to live with him in New York City. Their relationship didn't last, mainly due to his violent jealousy and drug addiction. He had wanted to marry her after she became pregnant with his child, but she refused and instead had an abortion. Tired of the physical abuse Thunders often inflicted upon her, and unable to adjust to the New York lifestyle, Starr moved back to Los Angeles. She claimed that \"He [Thunders] tried to destroy my personality. After I was with him, I just wasn't Sable Starr anymore. He really destroyed the Sable Starr thing\". She made frequent visits to New York where she had an affair with Richard Hell, befriended Nancy Spungen, and participated in the local burgeoning punk rock scene. By the early 1980s, she was no longer part of the groupie milieu.\n\nShe later moved to Reno, Nevada. She became a table game dealer at Carson Valley Inn in Minden until shortly before her death.\n\nStarr died at her home in Nevada on April 18, 2009 of brain cancer at the age of 51. She was survived by her partner, Bill Reiner, her daughter, Allie Shields, and her son, Christian Sharpsteen. \n"}

{"id": "55663263", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=55663263", "title": "Sylvia McAdam Saysewahum", "text": "Sylvia McAdam Saysewahum\n\nSylvia McAdam Saysewahum is a member of the Canadian Cree Nation. She is an advocate for First Nation and Environmental rights in Canada. She is a founding member of Idle No More, a lawyer, a professor, and an author. In all of these cases, her work is focused on spreading awareness and education about First Nation and Environmental rights.\n\nSylvia McAdam was born and raised on Treaty 6 territory, and is a direct descendent of those involved with creating the original treaty. She received her bachelors in human justice at the University of Regina. She is a single parent to six children. After earning her bachelors she had a variety of jobs including: social worker, radio announcer, firefighter and a resource officer with the Saskatoon Police Service. While working for the Saskatoon Police Service, Sayesewahum was inspired to continue to pursue law, and so she went to the University of Saskatchewan and earned her Juris Doctorate.\n\nMcAdam chose to change her name. Rather than McAdam, which was a name given to her grandfather in school, she chose Saysewahum, which is her family's traditional surname\n\nSaysewahum has been involved in activism both through Idle No More and independently. Her work generally pertains to issues of First Nation and Environmental rights. She was first inspired to take action after she returned to her father's land, and found that the creeks had dried up, and what were legally First Nation's traditional hunting grounds had been blocked off and were being logged. She reacted by nailing \"no trespassing\" signs all around the area, but that was not enough. Shortly after her experience with the hunting grounds, she read Bill C-45, and she realized the horrible implications it would have on the environment. Because of her law background, she understood the aspect of acquiescence in law, which means that your silence can be interpreted as consent. Saysewahum understood the ramifications of silence and idleness and how they undermine First Nation rights. She talked to Nina Wilson and Jessica Gordon about the consequences of the laws proposed by Bill C-45, and together, Idle No More was born.\n\nBill C-45 was an omnibus budget implementation bill that removed the environmental protections from many of Canada's rivers and lakes. This legislation was passed without consultation with First Nation peoples who it predominately affected. Idle No More fought against this. Their movement started as a hashtag, #idlenomore, to spread awareness about the issue of the bill. From there the group's coverage grew and they staged several teach-ins culminating in a flash mob on the National Day of Action. This movement was a catalysis for Indigenous groups abroad in the United States, Australia and New Zealand to stand up for their rights and the land.\n\nSince Bill C-45 protests, Idle No More has been involved in an array of issues including the housing crisis. Saysewahum became really aware of the housing disparity when she ran for chief of reserve in Big River First Nation. Though she did not win the election, she was dedicated to do something about the housing. So together Idle No More started the indiegogo campaign \"One House, Many Nations.\" Since Saysewahum has a legal education, she can speak to the original treaty terms that included rights to shelter. She drew on this legal understanding to call the colonial government out on what they needed to be providing.\n\nSaysewahum is the author of two books, \"Nationhood Interrupted: Revitalizing Nêhiyaw Legal Systems\" and \"First Nations Protocols and Methodologies\". Both books are centered around the topic of Cree Law but with different purposes. Through both of these books Saysewahum develops the intricacies of First Nations. By elucidating these systems she spreads education and counters the assumption that First Nation communities are lawless. Her books demonstrate her method of advocacy work where she connects her research and education with advocacy: expanding and explaining the First Nation legal systems that are so often ignored in Canadian politics.\n\nSaysewahum's first book, \"First Nations and Methodologies\" was originally published in 2009. When she wrote this book, it was the first time the elders had consented to having their oral laws and traditions written down. In this book, she also provides a guide to appropriate traditional etiquette for individuals attending ceremonial activities of Indigenous peoples in Saskatchewan.\n\nThis book was published in 2015. Saysewahum decided to write it after she realized that there was a lack of knowledge about indigenous law. She felt that when she brought it up in conversation most people did not even understand what she meant by indegenous law. Saysewahum suggests that cree laws are not that different from the broader Canadian laws except that they were previously unwritten and not understood. So, with her book she was able to explain this cross over. She believes the target audience for this book is everyone because it can create a template for Indigenous nations to revitalize their own laws, while also spreading education.\n\n\"Nationhood Interrupted has received several awards:\"\n\nSylvia McAdam/Saysewahum is the recipient of:\n\nCarol Geller Human Rights Award, the award is intended to support activists and advocates whose contributions to the improvement of rights often receive no official recognition.\n\nForeign Policy's Top 100 Global Thinkers Award,\n\nSocial Justice Award,\n\n2014 Global Citizen Award,\n\n2013 Social Courage Award: for exemplifying courage and honor in building and promoting a culture of peace and nonviolence in the face of political pressure and social struggle.\n"}

Early in his life, Wang fought in the Boxer Rebellion against the foreign Western and Japanese imperialist Eight-Nation Alliance. This was believed to be resulting from the fact that Ziping had lived most of his life with China under imperialist pressure from major European powers. Some accounts say he was forced into exile from his home after the end of the Boxer Rebellion and suppression of the Boxers, and became a student of Yang Hongxiu, from whom he learned the art of Chaquan.\n\nWang won fights against Russian, American, German, and Japanese martial artists.\n\nWang defeated a German officer's challenge in a weight lifting contest at Jiaoji. When the Germans wanted to take the antique doors of the Qinzhou mosque for themselves, Wang Zi-ping guarded the doors so the Germans challenged him to another weight lifting contest. When Wang triumphed over their challenge, the Germans left. Wang defeated a Russian who was rampaging around a public park located in Beijing after he boasted that he was the strongest fighter in the world in 1919. During a fight, Wang threw Japanese colonial military policemen down the stairs, one by one after they attacked him in Qingdao.\n\nWang and Zhu Guofu defended martial arts historian Tang Hao (Tang Fansheng) from opponents who were angered by his work \"Shaolin-Wudang Kao\" which refuted the story of Bodhidharma and Zhang Sanfeng as being the creators of Shaolin and Taijiquan.\n\nLiu Jin Sheng, who authored \"Chin Na Methods\" along with Zhao Jiang, was a student of Wang.\n\nHe developed an exercise regime for long life.
