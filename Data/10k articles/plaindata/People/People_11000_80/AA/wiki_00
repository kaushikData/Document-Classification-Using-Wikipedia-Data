{"id": "183215", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=183215", "title": "Agnes Martin", "text": "Agnes Martin\n\nAgnes Bernice Martin (March 22, 1912 – December 16, 2004) was a Canadian-born American abstract painter. Her work has been defined as an \"essay in discretion on inward-ness and silence\". Although she is often considered or referred to as a minimalist, Martin considered herself an abstract expressionist. She was awarded a National Medal of Arts from the National Endowment for the Arts in 1998.\n\nAgnes Bernice Martin was born in 1912 to Scottish Presbyterian farmers in Macklin, Saskatchewan, one of four children. From 1919, she grew up in Vancouver. She moved to the United States in 1931 to help her pregnant sister, Mirabell, in Bellingham, Washington. She preferred American higher education and became an American citizen in 1950. Martin studied at Western Washington University College of Education, Bellingham, Washington, prior to receiving her B.A. (1942) from Teachers College, Columbia University. In 1947 she attended the Summer Field School of the University of New Mexico in Taos, New Mexico. After hearing lectures by the Zen Buddhist scholar D. T. Suzuki at Columbia, she became interested in Asian thought, not as a religious discipline, but as a code of ethics, a practical how-to for getting through life. A few years following graduation, Martin matriculated at the University of New Mexico, Albuquerque, where she also taught art courses before returning to Columbia University to earn her M.A. (1952). She moved to New York City in 1957 and lived in a loft in Coenties Slip in lower Manhattan. She left New York City in 1967, disappearing from the art world to live alone. After eighteen months on the road, Martin settled in Cuba, New Mexico (1968-1977), and then Galisteo, New Mexico (1977-1993). She built an adobe home for herself in each location. She lived alone all her adult life. In 1993 she moved to a retirement residence in Taos, New Mexico, where she lived until her death in 2004.\n\nShe was publicly known to have schizophrenia, once opting for electric shock therapy for treatment.\n\nMany of her paintings bear positive names such as \"Happy Holiday\" (1999) and \"I Love the Whole World\" (2000). In an interview in 1989, discussing her life and her painting, Agnes Martin said, \"Beauty and perfection are the same. They never occur without happiness.\"\n\nA pioneer of her time, Agnes Martin never publicly expressed her sexuality, but has been described as a 'closeted homosexual' (sic). The 2018 biography \"Agnes Martin: Pioneer, Painter, Icon\" uncovers several romantic relationships between Martin and other women, including the dealer Betty Parsons. She often employed an intersectional feminist lens when she critiqued fellow artists' work. Jaleh Mansoor, an art historian, states that Martin was \"too engaged in a feminist relation to practice, perhaps, to objectify and label it as such\".\n\nHer work is most closely associated with Taos, with some of her early work visibly inspired by the desert environment of New Mexico. She moved to New York City at the invitation of the artist/gallery owner Betty Parsons in 1957 (the women had met prior to 1954). That year, she settled in Coenties Slip in lower Manhattan, where her friends and neighbors, several of whom were also affiliated with Parsons, included Robert Indiana, Ellsworth Kelly, Jack Youngerman, and Lenore Tawney. Barnett Newman actively promoted Martin's work, and helped install Martin's exhibitions at Betty Parsons Gallery beginning in the late 1950s. Another close friend and mentor was Ad Reinhardt. In 1961 Martin contributed a brief introduction to a brochure for her friend Lenore Tawney's first solo exhibition, the only occasion on which she wrote on the work of a fellow artist. In 1967, Martin famously abandoned her life in New York. Cited reasons include the death of her friend Ad Reinhardt the demolition of many buildings on Coenties Slip, and a breakup with the artist Chryssa whom Martin had dated off and on throughout the 1960s. In her ten years living in New York Martin was frequently hospitalised to control symptoms of schizophrenia which manifested in the artist in a number of ways, including aural hallucinations and states of catatonia: on a number of occasions she received electroconvulsive therapy at Manhattan's Bellevue Hospital. After Martin left New York, she drove about the western US and Canada, deciding to settle in Cuba, New Mexico for a few years (1968-1977), then settled in Galisteo, New Mexico (1977-1993). In both New Mexico homes, she built adobe brick structures herself. She did not return to art until 1973 and consciously distanced herself from the social life and social events that brought other artists into the public eye. She collaborated with architect Bill Katz in 1974 on a log cabin she would use as her studio. That same year, she completed a group of new paintings and from 1975 they were exhibited regularly.\n\nIn 1976 she made her first film, \"Gabriel\", a 78-minute landscape film which features a little boy going for a walk. A second movie, \"Captivity\", was never completed after the artist threw the rough cut into the town dump.\n\nAccording to a filmed interview with her which was released in 2003, she had moved from New York City only when she was told her rented loft/workspace/studio would be no longer available because of the building's imminent demolition. She went on further to state that she could not conceive of working in any other space in New York. When she died at age 92, she was said not to have read a newspaper for the last 50 years. Essays in the book dedicated to the exhibition of her work in New York at The Drawing Center (traveling to other museums as well) in 2005 – \"3x abstraction\" – analyzed the spiritual dimension in Martin's work. The 2018 biography \"Agnes Martin: Pioneer, Painter, Icon\" was the first book to explore Martin's relationship with women and her early life in substantial detail and was written in collaboration with Martin's family and friends.\n\nThe Agnes Martin estate is represented by Pace Gallery, New York.\n\nIn addition to a couple of self-portraits and a few watercolor landscapes, Martin's early works included biomorphic paintings in subdued colors made when the artist had a grant to work in Taos between 1955 and 1957. However, she did her best to seek out and destroy paintings from the years when she was taking her first steps into abstraction.\n\nMartin praised Mark Rothko for having \"reached zero so that nothing could stand in the way of truth\". Following his example Martin also pared down to the most reductive elements to encourage a perception of perfection and to emphasize transcendent reality. Her signature style was defined by an emphasis upon line, grids, and fields of extremely subtle color. Particularly in her breakthrough years of the early 1960s, she created 6 × 6 foot square canvases that were covered in dense, minute and softly delineated graphite grids. In the 1966 exhibition \"Systemic Painting\" at the Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum, Martin's grids were therefore celebrated as examples of Minimalist art and were hung among works by artists including Sol LeWitt, Robert Ryman, and Donald Judd. While minimalist in form, however, these paintings were quite different in spirit from those of her other minimalist counterparts, retaining small flaws and unmistakable traces of the artist's hand; she shied away from intellectualism, favoring the personal and spiritual. Her paintings, statements, and influential writings often reflected an interest in Eastern philosophy, especially Taoist. Because of her work's added spiritual dimension, which became more and more dominant after 1967, she preferred to be classified as an abstract expressionist.\n\nMartin worked only in black, white, and brown before moving to New Mexico. The last painting before she abandoned her career, and left New York in 1967, \"Trumpet\", marked a departure in that the single rectangle evolved into an overall grid of rectangles. In this painting the rectangles were drawn in pencil over uneven washes of gray translucent paint. In 1973, she returned to art making, and produced a portfolio of 30 serigraphs, \"On a Clear Day\". During her time in Taos, she introduced light pastel washes to her grids, colors that shimmered in the changing light. Later, Martin reduced the scale of her signature 72 × 72 square paintings to 60 × 60 inches and shifted her work to use bands of ethereal color. Another departure was a modification, if not a refinement, of the grid structure, which Martin has used since the late 1950s. In \"Untitled No. 4\" (1994), for example, one viewed the gentle striations of pencil line and primary color washes of diluted acrylic paint blended with gesso. The lines, which encompassed this painting, were not measured by a ruler, but rather intuitively marked by the artist. In the 1990s, symmetry would often give way to varying widths of horizontal bands.\n\nSince her first solo exhibition in 1958, Martin's work has been the subject of more than 85 solo shows and two retrospectives including the survey, \"Agnes Martin\", organized by the Whitney Museum of American Art, New York, which later traveled to Jamaica (1992–94) and \"Agnes Martin: Paintings and Drawings 1874–1900\" organized by the Stedelijk Museum, Amsterdam, with subsequent venues in France and Germany (1991–92). In 1998, The Museum of Fine Arts in Santa Fe, New Mexico mounted Agnes Martin Works on Paper. In 2002, the Menil Collection, Houston, mounted \"Agnes Martin: The Nineties and Beyond\". That same year, the Harwood Museum of Art at the University of New Mexico, Pandora, organized \"Agnes Martin: Paintings from 2001\", as well as a symposium honoring Martin on the occasion of her 90th birthday.\n\nIn addition to participating in an international array of group exhibitions such as the Venice Biennale (1997, 1980, 1976), the Whitney Biennial (1995, 1977), and Documenta, Kassel, Germany (1972), Martin has been the recipient of multiple honors including the Lifetime Achievement Award on behalf of the Women's Caucus for Art of the College Art Association (2005); Fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences (1992); the Governor's Award for Excellence and Achievement in the Arts given by Governor Gary Johnson, Santa Fe, New Mexico (1998); the National Medal of Arts awarded by President Bill Clinton and the National Endowment for the Arts (1998); the Distinguished Artist Award for Lifetime Achievement by the College Art Association (1998); the Golden Lion for Contribution to Contemporary Art at the Venice Biennale (1997); the Oskar Kokoschka Prize awarded by the Austrian government (1992); the Alexej von Jawlensky Prize awarded by the city of Wiesbaden, Germany (1991); and election to the American Academy and Institute of Arts and Letters, New York (1989).\n\nExhibitions continue to be mounted since her death in 2004, including Agnes Martin: Closing the Circle, Early and Late Feb 10, 2006 – Mar 04, 2006 at Pace Gallery. Other exhibitions have been held in New York, Zurich, London, Dublin, Edinburgh, Cambridge (England), Aspen, Albuquerque, New Mexico and in Penticton, British Columbia in Canada. In 2015, Tate Modern ran a retrospective of her life and career from the 1950s until her last work in 2004, which will travel to other museums after the show in London.\n\nAt the University of Michigan Museum of Art, Martin was featured in the exhibition \"Reductive Minimalism: Women Artists in Dialogue, 1960-2014\" which examined the two generations of Minimalist art side-by-side, from October 2014 through January 2015. The exhibition included Anne Truitt, Mary Corse, and contemporary artists Shirazeh Houshiary and Tomma Abts.\n\nShe was also featured in \"White on the White: Color, Scene, and Space\" in Hiroshima City Museum of Contemporary Art. From October 2015 through April 2016, Martin was exhibited in \"Opening the Box: Unpacking Minimalism\" at The George Economou Collection in Athens, Greece alongside Dan Flavin and Donald Judd. From 2015 to 2017 she had numerous solo exhibitions, some being at the Aspen Art Museum in Aspen Colorado, Tate Modern in London, K20, Kunstsammlung Nordhein-Westfalen in Dusseldorf, Los Angeles County Museum of Art (LACMA) in Los Angeles, Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum in the Upper East Side, at the Palace of Governors, The New Mexico Museum of History in Santa Fe. She is featured in the ongoing exhibition Intuitive Progression at the Fisher Landau Center for Art in Long Island City, New York from February 2017 to August 2017.\n\nIn 2016, a retrospective exhibition of her works from the 1950's through 2004 was presented at the Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum in New York. In 2016 she was also featured in the \"Dansaekhwa and Minimalism Exhibition\" at Blum & Poe, Los Angeles and earlier in the year in the show titled \"Aspects of Minimalism: Selections from East End Collections\" at the Guild Hall Museum in East Hampton, New York.\n\nShe will also be featured in \"Making Space: Women Artists and Postwar Abstraction\" at The Museum of Modern Art in Midtown, New York which shines light on women artists who worked post World War II and before the start of the Feminist movement. The exhibition is from April 2017 to August 2017 and features Lee Krasner, Helen Frankenthaler, and Joan Mitchell, Lygia Clark, Gego, Magdalena Abakanowicz, Louise Bourgeois, and Eva Hesse.\n\nMartin's work can be found in major public collections in the United States, including the New Mexico Museum of Art, Santa Fe, NM; Albright-Knox Art Gallery, Buffalo, NY; The Chinati Foundation, Marfa, TX; Hirshhorn Museum and Sculpture Garden, Smithsonian Institution, Washington, D.C.; Los Angeles Museum of Contemporary Art; The Menil Collection, Houston, TX; Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York; The Museum of Modern Art, New York; National Gallery of Art, Washington, D.C.; Nelson-Atkins Museum of Art, Kansas City; San Francisco Museum of Modern Art; Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum, New York; Wadsworth Atheneum Museum of Art, Hartford; Walker Art Center, Minneapolis; Whitney Museum of American Art, New York; and Des Moines Art Center, Des Moines, IA, among others. Her work is on \"long-term view\" and part of the permanent holdings of Dia Art Foundation, Beacon, New York.\n\nInternational holdings of Martin's work include the Tate, London and Magasin 3 Stockholm Konsthall, Stockholm, Sweden.\n\nMartin became an inspiration to younger artists, from Eva Hesse to Ellen Gallagher.\n\nIn 1994, the Harwood Museum of Art in Taos, part of the University of New Mexico, announced that it would renovate its Pueblo-revival building and dedicate one wing to Martin's work. The gallery was designed according to the artist's wishes in order to accommodate Martin's gift of seven large untitled paintings made between 1993 and 1994. An Albuquerque architectural firm, Kells & Craig, designed the octagonal gallery with an oculus installed overhead, and four yellow Donald Judd benches placed directly under the oculus. The gift of the paintings and gallery's design and construction were negotiated and overseen by Robert M. Ellis, the Harwood's director at the time and a close friend of Martin's. Today, the Agnes Martin Gallery attracts visitors from all over the world and has been compared by scholars to the Chapelle du Rosaire de Vence (Matisse Chapel), Corbusier's Chapel of Notre Dame du Haut in Ronchamp, and the Rothko Chapel in Houston.\n\n\nIn 2007, Martin's \"Loving Love\" (2000) was sold for $2.95 million at Christie's, New York. In 2015, \"Untitled #7\" (1984), a white acrylic painting with geometric pencil lines, sold for $4.2 million at Phillips in New York. In 2016, her \"Orange Grove\" sold at auction for $13.7 million, the same year as the Guggenheim held a retrospective of her work.\n\nComposer John Zorn's \"Redbird\" (1995) was inspired by and dedicated to Martin.\n\nWendy Beckett, in her book \"American Masterpieces,\" said about Martin: \"Agnes Martin often speaks of joy; she sees it as the desired condition of all life. Who would disagree with her?... No-one who has seriously spent time before an Agnes Martin, letting its peace communicate itself, receiving its inexplicable and ineffable happiness, has ever been disappointed. The work awes, not just with its delicacy, but with its vigor, and this power and visual interest is something that has to be experienced.\"\n\nPoet Hugh Behm-Steinberg's poem \"Gridding, after some sentences by Agnes Martin\" discusses patterns in the natural world, makes a parallel between writing and painting, and ends with a line about the poet's admiration of Martin's work.\n\nHer work inspired a Google doodle on the 102nd anniversary of her birth on March 22, 2014. The doodle takes color cues from Agnes Martin's late work which is marked by soft edges, muted colors and distinctly horizontal bands, turned to six vertical bars, one for each letter of the Google logo.\n\nIn 2018, Screaming Females, a New Jersey-based punk band, released a track titled after the late artist in their album All at Once.\n\n\n\n\n"}

He received the Gold Medal of Military Valor for his actions in command of the destroyer \"Francesco Nullo\" in the Attack on Convoy BN 7 in October 1940.\n\nBorsini was born in Milan in 1906. He was a top student at the Naval Academy of Livorno from March 15, 1922 to November 15, 1926. There he graduated as an Ensign, before embarking on the battleship \"Giulio Cesare\". He was then transferred to the battleship \"Andrea Doria\" and later served in succession on the hydrographic ship \"Ammiraglio Magnaghi\", the destroyer \"Augusto Riboty\", the destroyer \"Giovanni Da Verrazzano\" (after promotion to Sub-Lieutenant on 1 January 1929) and again on \"Giulio Cesare\", being promoted to Lieutenant in July 1932.\n\nIn 1933 he joined the Italian Naval Detachment in Tianjin (China). At his return to Italy he attended the course in Taranto as \"Aircraft Observer\" (naval officer attached to Regia Aeronautica aircraft employed against shipping) and in 1935 he received his patent; he subsequently served for one year as member of the 153rd Seaplane Squadron.\n\nHe was then transferred to the submarine branch till 1937, when he became executive officer on the destroyer , after which he was given command of the torpedo boat \"Clio\".\n\nIn January 1940 he was embarked on the colonial ship \"Eritrea\", stationed in the Eritrean Red Sea at Massawa, and in May of that year he was promoted to Lieutenant Commander and was given command of the destroyer \"Francesco Nullo\", operating in the Red Sea.\n\nOn October 21, following the unsuccessful attack on convoy BN 7, Borsini fought a fierce battle off Harmil island against HMS \"Kimberley\". In the battle, \"Nullo\" was seriously damaged, and Borsini brought his ship toward an Italian coastal battery so that its guns could hit \"Kimberley\".\n\nWhen \"Nullo\" started to sink, Borsini ordered the crew to save themselves, and decided to go down with his ship while at his command post. His orderly, seaman Vincenzo Ciaravolo, went back on board the sinking ship to reach his commander, and both went down with the ship. Both posthumously were awarded the Gold Medal of Military Valor. The attacking British destroyer \"Kimberley\" was hit by the Italian batteries and remained in repair until spring 1941.\n\nAfter the first minutes of combat against the British convoy BN 7, \"Francesco Nullo\" manoeuvred so as to attack again the convoy before following the destroyer \"Pantera\" toward Massawa, but \"Nullo\"'s rudder jammed for several minutes, and the two ships lost contact with each other. Borsini, chased by the incoming British warships, decided to approach the Italian batteries on Harmil island, hoping that they could hit the attacking enemy vessels.\n\nAt 02:20 British light cruiser \"Leander\" spotted \"Nullo\", and engaged her at a range of 4600 yards. The ships dueled for around ten minutes. \"Leander\" scored several hits, damaging \"Nullo\"'s gyrocompass and gunnery director. \"Nullo\" withdrew toward Harmil island and \"Leander\" pursued. Destroyer \"Kimberley\" joined the pursuit at 0300. At 0305 \"Leander\" turned back for the convoy.\n\nAt 05:40 on 21 October, \"Kimberley\" was off Harmil Island when her lookouts spotted \"Nullo\". \"Nullo\" spotted \"Kimberley\" around the same time, but Borsini assumed that the approaching destroyer was sistership \"Sauro\". \"Kimberley\" opened fire at 05:53, catching \"Nullo\" by surprise. \"Nullo\" returned fire four minutes later, and at 06:15 the four Italian 120 mm guns on Harmil Island joined the action.\n\nAt around 06:25 \"Nullo\" was hit by two shells from \"Kimberley\", one each in the forward and aft engine rooms. \"Nullo\" lost all power. Borsini gave the order to abandon ship and steered the ship towards Harmil, attempting to run it aground. He decided to sink with his ship. Borsini and his orderly Ciaravolo, who decided to die with him, were awarded the Gold Medal of Military Valor by the Italian Navy.\n\n\"Kimberley\" fired two torpedoes at \"Nullo\". The second of these, at 06:35, tore \"Nullo\" in two. The Harmil battery then found the range and landed a shell on \"Kimberley\"'s engine room, causing the ship to lose power. \"Kimberley\" fired at the shore battery while the crew frantically repaired the damage. Finally, \"Kimberley\"'s power was restored, and the ship managed to get out of range of the Harmil battery before losing power again and later be towed to safety in Port Sudan.\n\nOf the 204 members of \"Nullo\"<nowiki>'</nowiki>s crew, 190 survived and were rescued by personnel of the Harmil battery, while 12 perished in combat and two (Lieutenant Commander Borsini and his orderly Ciaravolo) voluntarily sank with the ship. The Italian Royal Navy, fearing that such attitude would cause the loss of too many experienced commanders (two more Italian navy commanders - Enrico Baroni of destroyer \"Espero\" and Lorenzo Bezzi of submarine \"Liuzzi\" - had already done so in the few months of war since Italy declared war to the Allies in June 1940), emitted on the next week an informal 'instruction' discouraging such actions (to little avail, as such episodes happened again several times during the war).\n\n\n"}

They\nchronicled their adventures in a book, Enchanted Vagabonds (1938), and went on the lecture\ncircuit to capitalize on the great public interest in their journey and lives as adventurers. They\ncontinued their travels in Mexico and Central America during the 1940s, during which time\nthey did some research for the Federal Government as special agents and produced a\nsubstantial report titled Report on Mexico in 1943.

The Lambs also spent time with the Lacandon Maya of eastern Chiapas.

Several of the photographs in the book depict the Lambs standing with overgrown ruins. These ruins have never been identified. A Mayan site named Laxtunich is known to have been a subsidiary site of Yaxchilan, in Chiapas, and has possibly been identified as the archaeological site at Tecolote, though it is of course unknown whether this is the site the Lambs visited.

{"id": "82433", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=82433", "title": "Diplomat", "text": "Diplomat\n\nA diplomat is a person appointed by a state to conduct diplomacy with one or more other states or international organizations. The main functions of diplomats are: representation and protection of the interests and nationals of the sending state; initiation and facilitation of strategic agreements; treaties and conventions; promotion of information; trade and commerce; technology; and friendly relations. Seasoned diplomats of international repute are used in international organizations (for example, the United Nations, the world's largest international diplomatic organization) as well as multinational companies for their experience in management and negotiating skills. Diplomats are members of foreign services and diplomatic corps of various nations of the world.\n\nDiplomats are the oldest form of any of the foreign policy institutions of the state, predating by centuries foreign ministers and ministerial offices. They usually have diplomatic immunity.\n\nThe regular use of permanent diplomatic representation began between the states of fifteenth century Italy. However the terms ‘diplomacy’ and ‘diplomat’ appeared in the French Revolution. \"Diplomat\" is derived from the Greek διπλωμάτης (\"diplōmátēs\"), the holder of a diploma, referring to diplomats' documents of accreditation from their sovereign.\n\nDiplomats themselves and historians often refer to the foreign ministry by its address: the Ballhausplatz (Vienna), the Quai d’Orsay (Paris), the Wilhelmstraße (Berlin); and Foggy Bottom (Washington). For imperial Russia to 1917 it was the Choristers’ Bridge (St Petersburg). The Italian ministry was called \"the Consulta.\"\n\nThough any person can be appointed by the state's national government to conduct said state's relations with other states or international organisations, a number of states maintain an institutionalised group of career diplomats—that is, public servants with a steady professional connection to the country's foreign ministry. The term \"career diplomat\" is used worldwide in opposition to \"political appointees\" (that is, people from any other professional backgrounds who may equally be designated by an official government to act as diplomats abroad). While officially posted to an embassy or delegation in a foreign country or accredited to an international organisation, both career diplomats and political appointees enjoy the same diplomatic immunities. Ceremonial heads of state commonly act as diplomats on behalf of their nation, usually following instructions from their head of Government.\n\nWhether being a career diplomat or a political appointee, every diplomat, while posted abroad, will be classified in one of the ranks of diplomats (secretary, counselor, minister, ambassador, envoy, or \"chargé d'affaires\") as regulated by international law (namely, by the Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations of 1961).\n\nDiplomats can be contrasted with consuls and attachés, who represent their state in a number of administrative ways, but who don't have the diplomat's political functions.\n\nDiplomats in posts collect and report information that could affect national interests, often with advice about how the home-country government should respond. Then, once any policy response has been decided in the home country's capital, posts bear major responsibility for implementing it. Diplomats have the job of conveying, in the most persuasive way possible, the views of the home government to the governments to which they are accredited and, in doing so, of trying to convince those governments to act in ways that suit home-country interests. In this way, diplomats are part of the beginning and the end of each loop in the continuous process through which foreign policy develops.\n\nIn general, it has become harder for diplomats to act autonomously. Diplomats have to seize secure communication systems, emails, and mobile telephones can be tracked down and instruct the most reclusive head of mission. The same technology in reverse gives diplomats the capacity for more immediate input about the policy-making processes in the home capital.\n\nSecure email has transformed the contact between diplomats and the ministry. It is less likely to leak, and enables more personal contact than the formal cablegram, with its wide distribution and impersonal style.\n\nThe home country will usually send instructions to a diplomatic post on what foreign policy goals to pursue, but decisions on tactics – who needs to be influenced, what will best persuade them, who are potential allies and adversaries, and how it can be done - are for the diplomats overseas to make.\n\nIn this operation, the intelligence, integrity, cultural understanding, and energy of individual diplomats become critical. If competent, they will have developed relationships grounded in trust and mutual understanding with influential members of the country in which they are accredited. They will have worked hard to understand the motives, thought patterns and culture of the other side.\n\nThe diplomat should be an excellent negotiator but, above all, a catalyst for peace and understanding between peoples. The diplomat's principal role is to foster peaceful relations between states. This role takes on heightened importance if war breaks out. Negotiation must necessarily continue – but within significantly altered contexts.\n\nMost career diplomats have university degrees in international relations, political science, economics, or law.\n\nDiplomats have generally been considered members of an exclusive and prestigious profession. The public image of diplomats has been described as \"a caricature of pinstriped men gliding their way around a never-ending global cocktail party\". J. W. Burton has noted that \"despite the absence of any specific professional training, diplomacy has a high professional status, due perhaps to a degree of secrecy and mystery that its practitioners self-consciously promote.\" The state supports the high status, privileges, and self-esteem of its diplomats in order to support its own international status and position.\n\nThe high regard for diplomats is also due to most countries' conspicuous selection of diplomats, with regard to their professionalism and ability to behave according to a certain etiquette, in order to effectively promote their interests. Also, international law grants diplomats extensive privileges and immunities, which further distinguishes the diplomat from the status of an ordinary citizen.\n\nWhile posted overseas, there is a danger that diplomats may become disconnected from their own country and culture. Sir Harold Nicolson acknowledged that diplomats can become \"denationalised, internationalised and therefore dehydrated, an elegant empty husk\".\n\nDiplomats have started celebrating International Day of Diplomats on October 24 since 2017. The idea of celebrating International Day of Diplomats on the day the United Nations was founded was proposed by Indian diplomat Abhay K to mark the occasion as diplomacy becoming the principal means of resolving disputes. \n\n"}

She is believed to have been inspirational for a number of Austen's works, such as \"Love and \", \"Henry and Eliza\", Lady Susan and Mansfield Park. She may have also been the model from whom the character of Mary Crawford is derived.\n\nEliza was born in India into an English gentry family. She was fourteen years older than her first cousin Jane Austen. She was the daughter of George Austen's sister Philadelphia, who had gone to India to marry Tysoe Saul Hancock in 1753, and has been believed by some to be the natural child of her godfather Warren Hastings, later to be the first Governor-General of Bengal. This belief was due to rumours circulated at the time by Jenny Strachey, and many elements show that Eliza was indeed the daughter of Tysoe Hancock. She moved to England with her parents, in 1765. In 1779 she settled in France and two years later she married a wealthy French Army Captain, Jean-François Capot de Feuillide, who was a count (\"comte\"). Eliza thus became \"Comtesse de Feuillide\". She came back to England with her mother in 1790, after the beginning of the French Revolution. Her husband, who was loyal to the French monarchy, was arrested for conspiracy against the Republic and guillotined in 1794.\n\nHer first cousin Henry Thomas Austen, brother of Jane Austen, then courted Eliza, and married her in December 1797; they had no children. Eliza's only son, Hastings (named after Warren Hastings), died in 1801.\n\nEliza died in April 1813, with Jane Austen at her bedside. Eliza and Austen had been quite close ever since she arrived in England. She is buried in the cemetery of St John-at-Hampstead in North London.\n\n\nIn this epistolary novel, Laura is writing to Marianne, the daughter of her most intimate friend, Isobel, \"comtesse de Feuillide\". Her vocabulary includes a few French words, and she writes \"Adeiu\" (sic) before her signature. According to a letter from Eliza de Feuillide, the title of the novel had been derived by Jane Austen from the Latin phrase inscribed on the back of a miniature portrait given to cousin Phylly Walter by Eliza, \"Amoris et Amicitiae\".\n\nEliza and Henry Austen are generally considered to be pictured here. This would then be a direct hint to the flirtation between the two that took place in real life. In \"Henry and Eliza\", Eliza appears to be, if not a natural child—as Eliza Hancock quite possibly was—at least a foundling.\n\nC. L. Thomson believed that Eliza de Feuillide was the model from which glamorous, shrewd and calculating Lady Susan had been created. Indeed, Miss Thomson argued, in 1929, that the courtship that took place between Henry Austen and Eliza de Feuillide is reflected in the novel by the courtship of Reginald de Courcy and Lady Susan; similarly, the letters written by Lady Susan to Johnson have the very style and tone of Eliza's own letters to Phylly Walter; however, Southam categorically rejects any biographical connection.\n\nIt has often been said that flirtatious Eliza, with all her talent on stage, her vivacity and attractiveness, was the model for the character of Mary Crawford in Mansfield Park. Several other similarities link the character of Mary Crawford with Eliza: just as the fictional character, Eliza Hancock had learned to ride, and played the harp.\n\nLikewise, the theatricals that play such a role in \"Mansfield Park\" are reminiscent of the plays in which Eliza de Feuillide was the leading lady, \"The Wonder – a woman keeps a secret\", by Susannah Centlivre, and \"The Chances\", a comedy by John Fletcher. The Austens' cousin Philadelphia Walter refused to come to Steventon with Eliza to take part in some of these plays, possibly because she disapproved of Eliza's behaviour: indeed, she had been visiting Eliza two months before, and came back with the memory of \"a dissipated life that [...] put me in mind that every woman is at heart a rake\".\n\n"}

He was a pupil of T. C. Farrar in New York, and studied at the Royal Academy of Dresden. After four months of study in Dresden, at the recommendation of James Whistler he went to London to study with that artist. However, on arriving there, he was recalled to New York to help deal with family financial problems. He gave drawing lessons for a year, and, the family's financial situation having improved, he returned to London to study with Whistler. He felt neglected by this master, however, and soon moved on. From 1870 to 1873, he studied under Ford Madox Brown and Edward Coley Burne-Jones in England, and worked in the school of William Morris, where he devoted particular attention to stained glass.\n\nHis family's financial situation again recalled him to New York in 1873. He taught painting at Cooper Institute, became known as an illustrator, painted portraits, designed stained glass, and subsequently confined himself to decorative work. He designed the chancel of Trinity Church, Boston, Massachusetts, and decorated the interior of Bowdoin College chapel, at Brunswick, Maine, and several churches in New York. The Marquand memorial window, in the former Marquand chapel at Princeton, New Jersey (destroyed 1920), was an example of his work in stained glass. His last work was a series of medallions for the building of the Hispanic-American Society in New York. He was one of the charter members of the Society of American Artists, and became an associate of the National Academy of Design, New York. He died at his home in Woodcliff Lake, New Jersey, on 18 October 1909.\n\n"}

He was one of the founders and the first governor of the National Bank of Greece.\n\nStavros was born in Ioannina, Epirus, a major intellectual center of the Greek world then under Ottoman rule. He studied in renowned schools of his home town, such as the Balaneios and then the Kaplaneios, under Athanasios Psalidas. Stavros, later moved to Vienna in order to take over the commercial business of his father, while studying at the local business school.\n\nBecause of his profession he had to travel in various European cities. In Saint Petersburg, he met Ioannis Kapodistrias, that time a diplomat in the service of the Russian Empire, that would play a key role in the Greek politics the following years. Stavros soon became a member of the patriotic organization Filiki Eteria.\n\nShortly after the outbreak of the Greek War of Independence (1821) he supported the uprising by supplying the revolutionaries with firearms, ammunition and food. In 1824 Stavros moved to Greece and the next year he was appointed Chief Cashier of the Executive body of the First Hellenic Republic, under Georgios Kountouriotis. Apart from his financial duties, he joined the armed struggle against the Ottoman Empire by leading an infantry group against Ibrahim Pasha of Egypt. He held the rank of \"Chiliarchos\" and was in charge of 50 men in central Greece, in order to support the defenders of Missolonghi during its Third Siege. Stavros participated in the Third National Assembly at Troezen (1827) as representative of the regions of Epirus and Central Greece, as well as in the Fifth National Assembly at Nafplion (1831), as representative of Epirus.\n\nDuring Kapodistrias' premiership (1828–1831), he participated in the three-member Economic Committee that was responsible for the operation of the first state bank of Greece, the \"National Financial Bank\" (), which issued money, the Phoenix, and securities.\n\nAfter the assassination of Kapodistrias, Greece came under the rule of King Otto. During this period Stavros, became a key figure in the establishment of the National Bank of Greece and was its first governor, elected in 1842. The National Bank of Greece was the sole institution that would issue banknotes in Greece (Drachmas) for the next 87 years. Until his death, Stavros laid the foundations for the organization and expansion of the Bank, due to experience gained from his business in Vienna as well as the guidance offered by the Swiss banker, Jean-Gabriel Eynard. Stavros remained in this post until his death in 1869.\n\nAt his own expense, Stavros established an orphanage in his home town of Ioannina.\nHis portrait is displayed on various pre-1932 Greek banknotes.\n"}

He is mainly known for his conflict with Alfred the Great.\n\nIt is not known how Guthrum consolidated his rule as king over the other Danish chieftains of the Danelaw (Danish-ruled territory of England), but by 874 he was able to wage a war against Wessex and its King, Alfred.\n\nIn 875, the Danish forces, then under Guthrum and Halfdan Ragnarsson, divided, Halfdan's contingent returning north to Northumbria, while Guthrum's forces went to East Anglia, quartering themselves at Cambridge for the year.\n\nBy 876, Guthrum had acquired various parts of the kingdoms of Mercia and Northumbria and then turned his attention to acquiring Wessex, where his first confrontation with Alfred took place on the south coast. Guthrum sailed his army around Poole Harbour and linked up with another Viking army that was invading the area between the Frome and Piddle rivers which was ruled by Alfred. According to the historian Asser, Guthrum won his initial battle with Alfred, and he captured the \"castellum\" as well as the ancient square earthworks known as the Wareham, where there was a convent of nuns.\n\nAlfred successfully brokered a peace settlement, but by 877 this peace was broken as Guthrum led his army raiding further into Wessex, thus forcing Alfred to confront him in a series of skirmishes that Guthrum continued to win. At Exeter, which Guthrum had also captured, Alfred made a peace treaty, with the result that Guthrum left Wessex to winter in Gloucester.\n\nOn Epiphany, 6 January 878, Guthrum made a surprise night-time attack on Alfred and his court at Chippenham, Wiltshire. It being a Christian feast day the Saxons were presumably taken by surprise—indeed it is possible that Wulfhere, the Ealdorman of Wiltshire, allowed the attack either through negligence or intent, for on Alfred's return to power later in 878 Wulfhere was stripped of his role as Ealdorman.\n\nAlfred fled the attack with a few retainers and took shelter in the marshes of Somerset, staying in the small village of Athelney. Over the next few months he built up his force and waged a guerrilla war against Guthrum from his fastness in the fens. After a few months Alfred called his loyal men to Egbert's Stone, and from there they travelled to Edington to fight the invaders.\n\nGuthrum's hopes of conquering all of Wessex came to an end with his defeat at the hands of Alfred at the Battle of Edington in 878. At Edington, Guthrum’s entire army was routed by Alfred's and fled to their encampment where they were besieged by Alfred's fyrd for two weeks. According to the \"Anglo-Saxon Chronicle\", Guthrum’s army was able to negotiate a peace treaty known as the Treaty of Wedmore. The \"Anglo-Saxon Chronicle\" recorded the event:\n\nUnder the Treaty of Wedmore, the borders dividing the lands of Alfred and Guthrum were established, Guthrum converted to Christianity, and he took on the Christian name Æthelstan with Alfred as his godfather. \n\nGuthrum upheld his end of the treaty and left the boundary that separated the Danelaw from English England unmolested. Guthrum, although failing to conquer Wessex, turned towards the lands to the east that the treaty had allotted under his control. Guthrum withdrew his army from the western borders facing Alfred's territory and moved eastward before eventually settling in the Kingdom of Guthrum in East Anglia in 879. He lived out the remainder of his life there until his death in 890. According to the \"Annals of St Neots\", a chronicle compiled in Bury St Edmunds, Guthrum was buried at \"Headleage,\" which is usually identified as Hadleigh, Suffolk.\n\nGuthrum appears in several works of fiction, including:\n\n\nOn screen, he was portrayed by Brian Blessed in episode 4 (\"King Alfred\") of \"Churchill's People\", by Michael York in the 1969 film \"Alfred the Great\", and Thomas W. Gabrielsson in \"The Last Kingdom\".\n"}

He began his Martial Arts training when he was 9 years old. He attained the top ranking Martial Arts position in Afghanistan at a young age and become the National Champion at the age of 16. At 18 he became the captain of Afghanistan National Team. In 1999 he had to flee Afghanistan because of war; he had become a Taliban target due to his high profile.\n\nHis new journey began in 1999 when he left Afghanistan in search of a new homeland. His family paid US$5000.00 to a smuggler to get Hussain out of Afghanistan to safety. His journey entailed traveling from central Afghanistan to Pakistan, then moving to Indonesia, and finally boarding a fishing boat along with 147 other asylums. It took him three months to reach Australia.\n\nSoon after arriving in Australia he was sent to a Detention Center for six months until he was released on a temporary protection visa. After being released he was selected to compete for the Afghan Tae Kwon Do team at the 2000 Sydney Olympic Games and carry his country flag at the Opening Ceremony.

Born and brought up in Farnworth, Lancashire, she is perhaps most well known for her role as Nellie Pledge in the ITV sitcom \"Nearest and Dearest\" (1968–73) and for her role in the 1960 film \"Saturday Night and Sunday Morning\".\n\nBaker was born in Farnworth, Lancashire, the first of seven children. Her father, Harold Baker, was a painter and signwriter, who also worked part-time in the music halls as a comedian. At ten, Baker made her debut at the Opera House, Tunbridge Wells, and continued to tour as a single variety act—singing, dancing and performing impersonations. By 14, she had started writing, producing and performing her own shows. Her most famous stage act was as a gossip from the North of England, with a silent, sullen companion named \"Big Cynthia\", almost always played by a man in drag (most famously by Victor Graham, and last by Matthew Kelly). Her act was full of malapropisms and catchphrases that had become part of her public persona, the most famous of which were \"She knows, y'know!\" and, when asked the time \"It's quarter past ... I must get a little hand put on this watch.\"\n\nFellow comedian Victoria Wood described her comedic talent as \"peculiarly Northern\".\n\nBaker came to national attention in BBC television's \"The Good Old Days\" in 1955. This led to her television series, \"Be Soon\" (named after another of her catchphrases), in 1957 and a supporting part in the sitcom \"Our House\" in 1960, followed by her own sitcom, \"The Best of Friends\", in 1963.\n\nShe also appeared in films, including Karel Reisz's \"Saturday Night and Sunday Morning\" (1960), \"Up the Junction\" (1968) and the film version of Lionel Bart's musical \"Oliver!\" (1968). Reisz had seen her performing her sketches at the Chiswick Empire theatre. She had a starring role in the 1962 low-budget black-and-white British comedy film \"She Knows Y'Know\". Taking its title from her most famous catch-phrase, it is described by the BFI as a \"low life comedy, unfolded against an industrial town backdrop\". The film was restored by Blackpool resident Eurwyn Jones who negotiated use of the print, tracked down copyright holders to ensure it could be shared with fans across the world, and teamed up with Renown Pictures, who restore classic movies, putting the print through modern technology to present a crystal clear picture quality and sound.\n\nBaker's most famous role was as Nellie Pledge in the Granada Television comedy series \"Nearest and Dearest\" (1968–73). Playing her brother Eli was the comedian Jimmy Jewel and the series was centred on their characters' love-hate relationship as they tried to run their small family business, \"Pledge's Purer Pickles\". As they bickered onscreen and traded insults such as \"knocked-kneed knackered old nosebag\" and \"big girl's blouse\", the insults continued offscreen as the two disliked each other intensely and their arguments became showbiz legend. A film version of the series was made by Hammer Films in 1972 (the same year she was a subject of \"This Is Your Life\" when she was surprised by Eamonn Andrews.). Later in the series, Baker began having trouble remembering her lines and had to rely on cue cards and prompts from her co star Madge Hindle, who would whisper her next line to her.\n\nBaker played a virtually identical role in the LWT comedy series \"Not On Your Nellie\" (1974–75). In this series she played Nellie Pickersgill, who moves to London from the North to run her ailing father's pub. However the series was short-lived and, by this time, Baker was again finding it difficult to remember her lines and was also refusing to attend rehearsals. After suing the production company for an on-set injury in which she broke her leg (after slipping on beer on the set), the series ended, as did her television acting career.\n\nBaker recreated her variety act in an episode of the BBC series \"The Good Old Days\" in 1976.\n\nIn an unusual coda to her musical career, she teamed with Arthur Mullard in 1978 to record a comedy version of \"You're the One That I Want\" from the film \"Grease\". Baker and Mullard, then aged 73 and 68, dressed in wigs and costumes similar to the John Travolta and Olivia Newton-John characters from \"Grease\" and appeared on the BBC show \"Top of the Pops\" and the Granada Television music show for children \"Get It Together\". The pair recorded an album of pop covers entitled \"Band on the Trot\".\n\nHer final television appearance came the same year in an episode of the BBC arts documentary show \"Omnibus\" about comedians, broadcast on 28 December 1978.\n\nBaker suffered two ectopic pregnancies which led in part to the breakdown of her marriage.\n\nOn Christmas Eve 1961, Baker was hit by a passing car that mounted the pavement in London's Charing Cross Road, not far from her then home at Ridgemount Gardens in Holborn. Left with a broken toe and bruising, Baker claimed she was unable to work for 34 weeks and that the accident had left her with \"a waddle\". She sued the driver of the vehicle for damages and loss of earnings. Baker refused a settlement offer of £4,000 and took the matter to the High Court where she was initially awarded £2,921 in 1964, but this was increased to £4,073 (plus costs) at an appeal hearing in 1965.\n\nIn 1971, Baker's chauffeur Noel Moncaster absconded with £2,500 of her cash. Moncaster was arrested three months later, by which time only £45 of the money remained, after he had used it to travel to France, Spain and Africa. At his trial, Blackpool Magistrates ordered Moncaster to pay Baker £400 (the maximum the magistrates could award) and committed him for later sentencing by Blackpool's quarter session court.\n\nBaker lived the life of a star, dressing in furs and keeping monkeys as pets. She annoyed her neighbours with loud parties at her Blackpool home. In her 70s she developed Alzheimer's disease and in 1981 she moved to Brinsworth House, the retirement home for performers, in Twickenham, London. In 1984, she moved to a psychiatric hospital in Epsom, Surrey, where she died two years later, aged 81, from bronchial pneumonia.\n\nActress Jean Fergusson, known for appearances in \"Last of the Summer Wine\", wrote a biography and devised and starred in a tribute show, \"She Knows Y' Know!\", at London's Vaudeville Theatre in 1997. The show won the Laurence Olivier Award for Best Entertainment in 1998.\n\nAlison Steadman played Baker in the play \"Our Hylda\" by Martyn Hesford, first broadcast on BBC Radio 4 on 15 June 2017.\n\n\n"}

He also served as an executive with firms including Babcock & Wilcox, several banks, and the newspaper El Correo.\n\nOn 20 May 1977 Javier Ybarra was kidnapped by renegade members of the Basque separatist group ETA, who entered his home in disguise, bound and gagged members of his family, and took him away in an ambulance. Demanding the release of a number of Basque prisoners (a condition largely met by the Spanish government), his captors later demanded a ransom of one billion pesetas and further prisoner releases. The situation had been complicated by the fact that the group that had kidnapped Ybarra formally renounced their affiliation with the larger ETA organization while holding him and were further disturbed when their leader was arrested in France. The Ybarra family attempted to negotiate with the kidnappers and push back the deadline for payment. The kidnappers failed to respond and on 20 June they announced they had killed Ybarra and sent a map supposedly showing the location of the body. When the Guardia Civil failed to find it, another communication was sent and the body of Javier Ybarra was found near a farmhouse in Navarra. He had been shot in the head and wrapped in a plastic sheet. \n\nOccurring in the immediate aftermath of Spain's first free national elections in forty years, the Ybarra killing provoked widespread condemnation. Following the discovery of the body, the Madrid daily newspaper ABC lead with a full page photo of Ybarra and a statement that \"all parties\" condemned the \"atrocious murder\".\n\n"}

That court ruled that the United States was obliged to have the defendants' cases reopened and reconsidered. The Supreme Court of the United States agreed to hear the case on May 1, 2007.\n\nThe Bush administration briefed the Supreme Court on the obligation to comply with international treaties. On March 25, 2008, in \"Medellín v. Texas\", the court rejected the Bush administration's arguments and cleared the way for Texas to execute the sentence. The International Court of Justice later ruled that the United States had violated its treaty obligations.\n\nOn June 24, 1993, Medellín carried out a gang initiation at T.C. Jester Park in Houston, Texas, along with five others: Peter Cantu, Venancio Medellín, Efrain Perez, Raul Villareal and Derrick O'Brien. Two others, Frank Sandoval and Ramon Sandoval, were present but did not participate in the initiation. The initiation involved the new member, Raul Villareal, submitting to beatings from the others. After this, the gang members remained in the park, drinking alcohol.\n\nTwo girls who had attended a birthday party, 14-year-old Jennifer Ertman and 16-year-old Elizabeth Peña, took a shortcut through the park to get home before an 11:30 p.m. curfew. They encountered the gang, and Medellín began talking to Peña and then grabbed her. She attempted to flee, but he forced her to the ground. When Peña cried for help, Ertman ran back to aid her. In response, Cantu and O'Brien pushed her to the ground as well. Ramon and Frank Sandoval chose to leave at that point.\n\nThe remainder of the gang, as well as Venancio Medellín, took turns anally, orally and vaginally raping the two girls. Afterwards, they were beaten, then the gang decided to murder the girls so they would not be identified as the rapists. Medellín killed one of the girls by using her shoelaces to strangle her, then crushing her neck with his foot. Other gang members strangled the other girl with a nylon belt, until the belt snapped.\n\nMedellín, Villareal, Perez, and Cantu then gathered at Cantu's home, where he lived with his brother, Joe Cantu, and sister-in-law, Christina Cantu. Christina Cantu questioned why Villareal was bleeding and Perez had a bloody shirt. This prompted Medellín to say the gang \"had fun\", and that details would appear on the news. He then elaborated that he had raped both girls. Peter Cantu then returned, and divided valuables that had been stolen from the girls. Medellín got a ring with an \"E\", so he could give it to his girlfriend, Esther. Medellín reported that he had killed a girl, and noted that he would have found it easier with a gun. Derrick Sean O'Brien was videotaped smiling at the scene of the crime. After the gang left, Christina Cantu convinced Joe Cantu to report the crime to police. Four days after the crime, the bodies were found in the park. They were badly decaying, and dental records were used for identification. The medical examiner corroborated the cause of death as strangulation. All those believed responsible were ultimately arrested. Medellín gave both a written and taped confession.\n\n 128 S. Ct. 1346; 170 L. Ed. 2d 190; 2008 U.S. LEXIS 2912; 76 U.S.L.W. 4143; 2008-1 U.S. Tax Cas. (CCH) P50,242; 21 Fla. L. Weekly Fed. S 126\n\nIn the International Court of Justice, Mexico sued the United States on behalf of Mexican citizens who had been sentenced to death without having their national consulate notified. The court ruled that the United States acted in error and required that the defendants' cases be reopened.\n\nInitially, the US government described Mexico's suit as \"an unjustified, unwise and ultimately unacceptable intrusion in the United States criminal justice system.\" Reversing that position in early 2005, with Medellín's death-penalty appeal pending before the Supreme Court, the White House announced that it would abide by the decision by instructing the states to reconsider the convictions and sentences of the Mexican nationals on death row. The Supreme Court then dismissed Medellín's case to enable the Texas courts to comply with that directive.\n\nThe Texas Court of Criminal Appeals refused to change their rules barring reconsideration of such cases. In that decision, one of the court's judges accused the White House of an \"unprecedented, unnecessary and intrusive exercise of power over the Texas court system\". In response, the Bush administration entered the case on Medellín's behalf and urged the Supreme Court to overturn the Texas court's decision. The case, \"Medellín v. Texas\", No. 06-984, was argued on October 10, 2007 and decided on March 25, 2008. The US government's brief, filed by Solicitor General Paul D. Clement, told the justices that the Texas court's decision, if not reversed, \"will place the United States in breach of its international law obligation\" to comply with the International Court of Justice's decision and would \"frustrate the president's judgment that foreign policy interests are best served by giving effect to that decision.\" Chief Justice Roberts, joined by Justices Scalia, Kennedy, Thomas and Alito, rejected the Bush administration's arguments. Justice Stevens wrote a concurring opinion. Justice Breyer, joined by Justices Souter and Ginsburg, dissented.\n\nOn July 16, 2008, the International Court of Justice asked for a stay of execution on behalf of Medellin and four other Mexican nationals who also did not receive consular notification.\n\nOn July 17, 2008, Robert Black, spokesman for Texas Governor Rick Perry, said the state would continue with the scheduled August 5, 2008 execution despite the International Court of Justice order for a stay. \"The world court has no standing in Texas and Texas is not bound by a ruling or edict from a foreign court.

Huxtable has exhibited and performed at a number of venues including Reena Spaulings Fine Art, Project Native Informant, Artists Space, the New Museum, the Museum of Modern Art, Portland Institute of Contemporary Arts, and Institute of Contemporary Arts. Huxtable's multidisciplinary art practice explores a number of projects, such as the internet, the body, history, and text, often through a process she calls \"conditioning.\" Huxtable is a published author of two books and a member of the New York City-based collective House of Ladosha. She currently lives and works in New York City.\n\nHuxtable was born in Houston, Texas and raised in Bryan-College Station, Texas. She has described her hometown as a typical \"conservative Bible Belt town in Texas.\" Huxtable's mother, Kassandra, raised Huxtable and her two siblings alone after Huxtable's parents divorced.\n\nHuxtable was born intersex and began her transition after college. She notes that struggles with gender conformity and sex identity started earlier in life.\n\nHuxtable moved to New York to attend Bard College and graduated in 2010. Huxtable has spoken about the desire to be a painter while growing up and enrolled in several painting classes during college. She abandoned the medium after professors criticized her for her \"obsession with\" formal technique and identity. In an interview with artist Lorraine O'Grady, Huxtable mentions studying literature and gender studies.\n\nHuxtable moved to New York to work as a legal assistant for the ACLU's Racial Justice Program after college. While at the ACLU, Huxtable amassed a significant following on Tumblr, posting long stream-of-consciousness poems and self-portraits that experimented with fashion and Nuwaubian imagery.\n\nAfter leaving her position at the ACLU, Huxtable began DJing.\n\nIn 2013, Huxtable participated in the House of Ladosha's show \"Whole House Eats\" at Superchief Gallery. During her time as a DJ, Huxtable regularly integrated her poetry into DJ mixes. Huxtable's poetry was featured in the song \"Blood Oranges\" from Le1f's mixtape Tree House as well as the runway soundtrack for the Hood by Air Fall/Winter fashion show \"10,000 Screaming Faggots\" by Total Freedom.\n\nHuxtable's interest in fashion led her to model for a number of fashion houses and campaigns. In 2014, she was featured on the fifth anniversary cover of \"C☆NDY\" magazine along with 13 other transgender women – Janet Mock, Carmen Carrera, Geena Rocero, Isis King, Gisele Alicea, Leyna Ramous, Dina Marie, Nina Poon, Yasmine Petty, Niki M'nray, Pêche Di, Carmen Xtravaganza and Laverne Cox. Huxtable has modeled for DKNY, Eckhaus Latta, Chromat, and French fashion house Kenzo.\n\nIn August 2014, Huxtable performed in the video for the Hercules and Love Affair song \"My Offence.\" The video features excerpts of conversations with figures from New York City's queer nightlife scene such as Honey Dijon and Contessa Stuto. The band's primary member, Andrew Butler, described the song and its video as an examination of his \"relationship to taboo words and the use of 'cunt' amongst NYC's gay community to relay flattery, empowerment and strength\".\n\nIn early 2015, Huxtable was selected to present work in the 2015 New Museum Triennial \"Surround Audience,\" curated by Lauren Cornell and artist Ryan Trecartin. Huxtable included two text-based works and two self-portraits, each an inkjet print from the series \"Universal Crop Tops For All The Self-Canonized Saints of Becoming.\" These works, along with a sculpture by fellow Triennial artist Frank Benson that depicted a life-sized Huxtable rendered in iridescent colors, were prominent works in the show. Writer Mark Guiducci dubbed Huxtable the \"Star of the New Museum Triennial\".\n\nHuxtable premiered on season two of Ovation TV's web-based talk show, \"Touching the Art\", hosted by fellow 2015 Triennial artist Casey Jane Ellison. Artist K8 Hardy and New Museum curator Shelley Fox Aarons were also guests in the same episode.\n\nLater that year, Huxtable was selected to showcase a new performance piece in the Performa 15 Biennial. The hour-long performance titled, \"There Are Certain Facts That Cannot Be Disputed,\" was presented at the Museum of Modern Art. It included poetry, audio and voice over, video elements, and live-music with fellow collaborators and explored the complicated relationship between the ephemeral nature of digital information and the drive for historical documentation on the internet. As described by the festival's organizers, Huxtable's performance considered \"cyberspace as a twilight zone of precariousness and preservation, traversing closed servers, bounced URLs, and Google cache as human and digital characters\".\n\nHuxtable is a founder and DJ for \"Shock Value,\" a weekly New York City-based nightlife collective run by women artists, DJs, writers, and fashion icons.\n\nHuxtable is a member of the New York City-based collective House of Ladosha. Members include Cunty Crawford Ladosha (Adam Radakovich), Neon Christina Ladosha (Christopher Udemezue), Paws Off Ladosha (Riley Hooker), Magatha Ladosha (Michael Magnan), La Fem Ladosha (Antonio Blair), and YSL Ladosha (Yan Sze Li). In January 2016, House of Ladosha showcased various art projects in \"This Is Your Brain\". In 2017, the collective was selected to participate in the group exhibition \"Trigger: Gender as a Weapon and a Tool\" at the New Museum. They were also featured in Issue 7 of the magazine \"Gayletter\".\n\nHuxtable currently sits on the editorial board for Topical Cream, a New York-based platform that supports a community of artists, writers, designers, and technologists through digital publishing and public programming initiatives. Topical Cream was founded in 2013 and its board members include Lyndsy Welgos, Ara Anjargolian, Whitney Mallett, Juliana Huxtable, and Aria Dean.\n\nIn 2016, Huxtable was a Visiting Artists Program lecturer at the School of the Art Institute of Chicago.\n\nHuxtable has participated in multiple panels and lectures, including \"Basquiat and Contemporary Queer Art\" hosted by the Schomburg Center for Research in Black Culture, \"Transgender in the Mainstream\" hosted by Art Basel Miami Beach, and \"Open Score: Generation You\" presented by the New Museum and Rhizome.\n\nLater that year, Huxtable headlined the opening night performance of the Portland Institute for Contemporary Art's Time-Based Art Festival in Portland, Oregon.\n\nHuxtable's first solo exhibition, \"A Split During Laughter at the Rally\", opened at \"Reena Spaulings\" in New York City in May 2017. The exhibition featured several posters with DIY-inspired magnets, a video piece featuring members from House of Ladosha, and a flow chart. The show explored \"the aesthetics of conspiracy and American paranoia\" through various modes of resistance, alienation, and irony. Huxtable notes that the posters in the exhibition were formally inspired by American artist Emory Douglas.\n\nHuxtable's second solo exhibition, \"Juliana Huxtable\", opened at \"Project Native Informant\" in London, England in October 2017. The exhibition featured three photographs of a black subject with various (often conflicting) tattoos, four sculptural paintings made of military-style clothing, and ten pamphlet-sized posters recounting, \"a brawl between Antifa leftist skinheads and Nazi skinheads outside of a Fred Perry sample sale in Paris\". The show continues Huxtable's exploration into conspiracy theories and paranoia, subcultures, and identity but on a more humorous note. Fashion also plays a major role throughout Huxtable's practice as this show highlights. Huxtable has referenced Jose Esteban-Muñoz's \"Disidentification\" as a major inspiration.\n\nHuxtable is the author of two books and has contributed to numerous chapbooks and artist's writing anthologies.\n\nHer first book, \"Mucus in My Pineal Gland,\" was published in 2017 by Capricious. The book is a collection of previously performed poems, like \"UNTITLED (FOR STEWART)\" and \"THERE ARE CERTAIN FACTS THAT CANNOT BE DISPUTED,\" as well as a number of new poems. The book is written in her typical all-caps style and blue font.\n\nHuxtable's second book, \"Life\", was co-written with artist Hannah Black. The novel is a work of science-fiction and is written in both English and German. It was released in 2017 by König.\n\nStyle\n\nHuxtable's practice is interdisciplinary by nature and thus explores a range of topics. Earlier works explore ideas of identity, the body, and text, with influences from Afrofuturism and science fiction. Huxtable's more recent works explore language, conspiracy theories, fashion (Baroque costumes, military surplus, punk aesthetics, etc.), and various countercultures. Huxtable's visual practice includes, \"examining and remixing enduring imagery that, in her observations, retain 'symbolic power.'\"\n\nSteven Zultanski writes of Huxtable's \"Mucus in My Pineal Gland\", \"...doesn't idealize genrelessness, it moves between genres, unmooring moments of personal experience and speculative thought from literary conventions in order to situate them in the world outside of the text, while reflecting on and enjoying those conventions.\" Huxtable often, \"references her use of digital spaces, including Tumblr,\" chat rooms, social media, online sexual subcultures, Encarta, and Afripedia as well as childhood, fashion, consumer culture, and the African diaspora.\n\nInfluences\n\nHuxtable has noted a range of influences including writers Octavia Butler and Samuel R. Delany, theorists Luce Irigaray and Jose Esteban-Muñoz, and the visual aesthetics of video director Hype Williams, bands TLC and Blaque, and singer Aaliyah. Nuwaubian culture has often been a major source of inspiration for her as well. Huxtable's \"Mucus in My Pineal Gland\" is dedicated to \"Herculine, Borges, LaDosha, and Pickaninny Punks.\"\n\nSolo exhibitions\nSelected group exhibitions\nSelected online exhibitions\nSelected performances\nSelected DJ sets\n\n\n\n\n"}

In 1943, Stalin subsequently declared the Kalmyk population as a whole to be German collaborators and had them deported to Siberia suffering great loss of life.\n\nWhen Erich von Manstein led the 16th Motorized Infantry Division into Kalmykia in early 1942 he already had some Kalmyk advisors from a committee drawn together by Goebbels for propaganda purposes. These were supplemented by other Kalmyks who had settled in Belgrade following their flight with White Russian emigres after the Russian October Revolution.\n\nKalmyk Kavallerie Korps acted within German Wehrmacht as an independent allied force with all leadership positions taken by Kalmyks. Most of the officers were Kalmyks themselves, with previous Soviet military experience. A few Germans that were present within the corps performed only auxiliary and administrative functions.\n\nUnlike most other national \"volunteer\" divisions, the Kalmykian Cavalry Corps incorporated genuine volunteers willing to fight together with Germans. The other national divisions relied upon recruits from POW camps. \nMore Kalmyks fought in the Kalmykian Cavalry Corps than in comparable units of the Soviet army.\n\nThe Kalmykian Cavalry Corps fought with the Wehrmacht behind the lines, especially around the Azov Sea. At the end of 1944, the surviving Kalmyk cavalry troops, together with their families, retreated with the German army. About 2,000 went to Silesia, Poland and 1,500 to Zagreb, Croatia, where they were reorganized to fight against the partisans.\n\nAfter the war, nearly all of the surviving Kalmyk soldiers along with the Kalmyk families that accompanied them were forcibly repatriated to the Soviet Union.\n\nThe Kalmykian people were internally deported for 13 years as a punishment for collaborating with Germans.\n\n"}
{"id": "489731", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=489731", "title": "Katharine Gun", "text": "Katharine Gun\n\nKatharine Teresa Gun (\"née\" Harwood, born 1974) is a British former translator for the Government Communications Headquarters (GCHQ), a British intelligence agency. In 2003, she leaked top-secret information to the press concerning illegal activities by the United States of America in their push for the 2003 invasion of Iraq. Some of these activities include the US National Security Agency's eavesdropping operation on countries tasked with passing a second United Nations resolution on the invasion of Iraq.\n\nGun was born in Taiwan to British parents. Her upbringing later led her to describe herself as a \"third culture kid\". After spending her childhood in Taiwan, Gun studied Japanese and Chinese at Durham University in England. Finding it difficult to find work as a linguist, Gun applied to GCHQ after reading a newspaper advertisement for the organisation. Gun had previously been unaware of GCHQ, later saying that \"I didn't have much idea about what they did...I was going into it pretty much blind. Most people do.\"\n\nGun's regular job at GCHQ in Cheltenham was to translate Mandarin Chinese into English. While at work at GCHQ on 31 January 2003, Gun read an email from Frank Koza, the chief of staff at the \"regional targets\" division of the American intelligence agency, the National Security Agency.\n\nKoza's email requested aid in a secret and illegal operation to bug the United Nations offices of six nations: Angola, Bulgaria, Cameroon, Chile, Guinea, and Pakistan. These were the six \"swing nations\" on the UN Security Council that could determine whether the UN approved the invasion of Iraq. The plan allegedly violated the Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations, which regulate global diplomacy.\n\nGun was outraged by the email, and took a printed copy of it home with her. After contemplating the email over the weekend, Gun gave the email to a friend who was acquainted with journalists. Gun heard no more of the email until Sunday 2 March, when she saw it reproduced on the front page of \"The Observer\" newspaper. Less than a week after the \"Observer\" story, on Wednesday 5 March, Gun had confessed to her line manager at GCHQ that she had leaked the email, and was arrested. In a BBC interview with Jeremy Paxman, she said that she had not raised the matter with staff counsellors as she \"honestly didn't think that would have had any practical effect.\" Gun spent a night in police custody and was subsequently charged with breaking the Official Secrets Act eight months later. The case against Gun was dropped after the prosecution declined to offer any evidence. Gun later embarked on a postgraduate degree course in global ethics at Birmingham University.\n\nOn 13 November 2003, Gun was charged with an offence under section 1 of the Official Secrets Act 1989. Her case became a \"cause célèbre\" among activists, and many people stepped forward to urge the government to drop the case. Among them were Reverend Jesse Jackson, Daniel Ellsberg (the US government official who leaked the Pentagon Papers), and actor Sean Penn, who described her as \"a hero of the human spirit\". Gun planned to plead \"not guilty\", saying in her defence that she acted to prevent imminent loss of life in a war she considered illegal.\n\nThe case came to court on 25 February 2004. Within half an hour, the case was dropped because the prosecution declined to offer evidence. The reasons for the prosecution dropping the case are unclear. The day before the trial, Gun's defence team had asked the government for any records of advice about the legality of the war that it had received during the run-up to the war. A full trial might have exposed any such documents to public scrutiny as the defence were expected to argue that trying to stop an illegal act (that of an illegal war of aggression) trumped Gun's obligations under the Official Secrets Act 1989. Speculation was rife in the media that the prosecution service had bowed to political pressure to drop the case so that any such documents would remain secret. However, a Government spokesman said that the decision to drop the case had been made before the defence's demands had been submitted. \"The Guardian\" newspaper had reported plans to drop the case the previous week. On the day of the court case, Gun said \"I'm just baffled that in the 21st century we as human beings are still dropping bombs on each other as a means to resolve issues.\"\n\nGun received the Sam Adams Award for 2003 and was supported in her case by the UK human rights pressure group Liberty and in the US by the Institute for Public Accuracy. Following the dropping of the case, Liberty commented \"One wonders whether disclosure in this criminal trial might have been a little too embarrassing.\"\n\nTwo years after her trial, Katharine Gun wrote an article entitled \"Iran: Time to Leak\" (20 March 2006), which asked whistleblowers to make public information about plans for a potential war against Iran. She urged \"those in a position to do so to disclose information which relates to this planned aggression; legal advice, meetings between the White House and other intelligence agencies, assessments of Iran's threat level (or better yet, evidence that assessments have been altered), troop deployments and army notifications. Don't let \"the intelligence and the facts be fixed around the policy\" this time.\"\n\nIn February 2018, it was announced that a film, \"Official Secrets\", recounting Gun's actions in 2003 was due to begin filming in March 2018 with Keira Knightley taking the part of Gun. Also that month, Daniel Ellsberg praised the swiftness and importance of Gun taking action, saying it was in some ways more significant than his own whistleblowing on the Vietnam War.\n\n\n\n"}

She was the first Republican governor of Hawaii since 1962. Lingle was also the first female governor of Hawaii and its first Jewish governor. Prior to serving as governor, Lingle served as Maui County mayor, council member, and chair of the Hawaii Republican Party.\n\nDuring the 2004 Republican National Convention in New York City, Lingle served as chair of the convention during the absence of permanent chair Dennis Hastert from the convention floor. She was the 2012 Republican nominee for the United States Senate, vying unsuccessfully for an open seat vacated by retiring U.S. Senator Daniel Akaka.\n\nIn January 2015, Lingle was appointed as a senior adviser to Illinois Governor Bruce Rauner. She also serves on the Governors’ Council of the Bipartisan Policy Center in Washington, D.C.\n\nLingle was born Linda Cutter to a Jewish family in St. Louis, Missouri in 1953, the daughter of Mildred and Richard Cutter. Lingle moved with her parents to Southern California when she was 12. She graduated from Birmingham High School in Lake Balboa, California (at that time, part of Van Nuys), then received her bachelor's degree in journalism \"cum laude\" from California State University, Northridge, in 1975.\n\nSoon after that, she followed her father to Hawaii, working first in Honolulu as a public information officer for the Teamsters and Hotel Workers Union. Later, she moved to Molokai, where she started the \"Molokai Free Press\", a community newspaper.\n\nIn 1980, Lingle was elected to the Maui County Council, where she served five two-year terms. Lingle served three of those terms representing Molokai and two terms as an at-large member. Upon the 1990 retirement of Hannibal Tavares as mayor of Maui County, Lingle decided to challenge former Maui mayor and Hawai'i State Speaker of the House of Representatives Elmer Cravalho for the seat. Despite polls showing Lingle trailing far behind her Democratic opponent, Lingle proved victorious. The \"Honolulu Advertiser\" and \"Honolulu Star-Bulletin\" newspapers declared the election one of the biggest upsets in Hawai'i political history. She became the youngest person elected to the office of Maui County Mayor, at the age of 37, as well as the first woman. She was sworn into office as Mayor of Maui on January 2, 1991. In 1994, Lingle easily won re-election over her Democratic opponent, Maui County councilman Goro Hokama.\n\nUnder Lingle's leadership, Maui County implemented performance-based budgeting. Its successful passage and execution earned for Lingle the \"Distinguished Budget Presentation Award\" from the Government Finance Officers Association for four years. Mayor Lingle was also credited for attracting tourism and job growth to Maui County during a period when the state tourism industry was struggling.\n\nLingle would once again attempt an upset victory, this time in pursuit of the governor's office in 1998. Barred from seeking a third term as mayor of Maui, Lingle was nominated by the Hawaii Republican Party to run against incumbent Governor Benjamin J. Cayetano. Republican party members believed that Lingle was the best shot at the office and that 1998 would probably be the only chance the party would have of ever winning. Lingle capitalized on the anger of Hawaii residents over the stagnant economy and their dissatisfaction with the strategies employed by the Democrats in attempt to solve the problem. Cayetano trailed in the media polls heading into the November election but on the evening of the election, Cayetano and Lingle were separated by a single percentage point forcing a recount. Lingle was defeated in the closest election in Hawaii history.\n\nThe state Democratic Party was accused of launching a whisper campaign alleging that Lingle was a lesbian, and that she would abolish Christmas as a state holiday. Previously, Governor Cayetano had given state workers all of Christmas Eve day off, and other local government leaders followed suit – except then-Maui County Mayor Lingle, who said it would be too costly.\n\nAfter being defeated, Lingle was elected chair of the Hawaii Republican Party. She served from 1999 to 2002. During her tenure as party chair, Lingle overhauled party policies and gave the party a lift she believed was needed to make the party competitive in a historically Democratic Party-dominated state. Internal reforms proved successful and Lingle succeeded in electing more Republicans to seats in both houses of the Hawaii State Legislature. At the peak of Republican success, the party held 19 of the 51 seats in the state House of Representatives. Party membership grew as younger people joined. Republicans gained a more youthful appearance and had reinvented itself informally as the new GOP Hawaii. Lingle is a member of The Wish List, America's largest fundraising and campaign political action committee for Pro-choice Republican Women and The Republican Majority for Choice.\n\nBarred from seeking a third term, Cayetano announced his retirement from political service in 2002. Having become even more popular among Hawaii residents, Lingle was nominated as the Republican candidate for the office of Governor of Hawaii. Her campaign was substantially aided when the popular favorite, Democratic Mayor of the City and County of Honolulu Jeremy Harris withdrew after allegations of campaign finance irregularities. Hawaii Democrats then nominated incumbent Lieutenant Governor Mazie Hirono; it was one of the few gubernatorial races in which both major candidates were women.\n\nLingle ran on her \"Agenda for New Beginnings,\" a campaign platform developed to promote Republican leadership and highlight their criticisms of the previous 40 years of Democratic administration of the state. It also cited differences between Lingle's message and the previous, more conservative platforms which Hawaii Republicans had advocated.\n\nFocusing less on her mayoral accomplishments and more on the message of reform, Lingle won the election alongside former state judge Duke Aiona, who became Lingle's lieutenant governor.\n\nLingle was the first state Governor-elect not to be inaugurated at the Coronation Pavilion on the grounds of Iolani Palace. She was inaugurated in the rotunda of the Hawaii State Capitol. She took the oath of office upon a Tanakh.\n\nLingle signed into law the Three Strikes Law and Sex Offender Registry Website Law. She vetoed a bill that would have required all hospitals in Hawaii to provide emergency contraception to rape victims, concerned that Catholic hospitals would challenge it. In May 2004 Lingle led a delegation to Israel, paid for by the Israeli Government. She enjoyed high approval ratings, usually around 70 percent.\n\nLingle spent much of 2004 campaigning for Republican candidates, both in the Presidential election and the Hawaii state legislature. She supported President George W. Bush's Iraq policies, and campaigned for Bush in the contiguous United States. When some polling late in the election showed Bush tied or narrowly leading Democrat John Kerry, Lingle attempted to help Republicans carry her state for the first time since 1984. Vice President Dick Cheney also campaigned in the state. The state legislature had a Democratic supermajority and she wanted to have enough members to block them from overriding her vetoes. Ultimately, not only did Kerry win the state, but Republicans lost five seats in the state legislature, reducing their presence to near single-digits and causing the Democrats to consider Lingle more vulnerable than they initially expected. In spite of their new confidence, Lingle was re-elected after her 2006 re-election campaign.\n\nIn education, she attempted to divide the State Board of Education into seven local school boards, but failed. One of the more controversial issues Lingle has championed is the practice of sending prisoners to the mainland, as opposed to building a new prison in Hawaii.\n\nIn 2006, Lingle announced her candidacy for re-election as Governor of Hawaii. In the Democratic Party, many people were speculated to run, but many of them declined, including State Senator Colleen Hanabusa, then Senate President Bobby Bunda, former Congressman Ed Case (who ran for U.S. Senate), U.S. Congressman Neil Abercrombie, and Hawaii County Mayor Harry Kim. Despite the difficulty of finding an opponent for Lingle, former State Senator Randy Iwase decided to run for Governor. In the primary election he easily defeated Waianae Harbormaster William Aila Jr., and ended up with former Big Island State Senator Malama Solomon as his running mate. Over the course of the campaign, Iwase was considered an underdog who had only spent $340,000, compared to Lingle's $6 million; in his ads, he attacked Lingle over her relationship with President Bush. Governor Lingle won by the largest margin in state history, 63 percent to 35 percent.\n\nIn August 2007, the Hawaii Supreme Court invalidated a Lingle appointee's exemption of the Hawaii Superferry from having to undertake an environmental assessment before operating in Hawaii waters. The Superferry was an $80 million high-speed ferry. Despite the Court's ruling, the ferry sailed to Kauai without an environmental assessment. It was met by protesters on surfboards who turned the ferry back to Oahu. Lingle summoned a massive police and Coast Guard response. She told Kauai protesters that they would be charged under Hawaii's anti-terrorism laws if they continued to interfere with the Superferry's operation. Lingle sought a legislative exemption from environmental law on behalf of the Superferry (known as Act Two). Several Maui groups, including the Sierra Club, Maui Tomorrow and the Kahului Harbor Coalition challenged the law as unconstitutional, citing a violation of separation of powers, and favoritism towards a single company. The ferry suspended all Hawaii service in March 2009, days after the Hawaii Supreme Court struck down Act Two as unconstitutional.\n\nAs she had four years before, Lingle campaigned for the Republican ticket, describing herself as \"of the same breed as McCain and Palin.\" She received national exposure when she delivered a primetime address on the third night of the 2008 Republican National Convention praising John McCain's choice of Alaska Governor Sarah Palin as his vice-presidential running-mate. Lingle and Palin, both Republican women governors of non-contiguous states, are friends who grew acquainted through the Republican Governors Association. Lingle's speech filled the role of the traditional address formally nominating the vice-presidential candidate, though Palin was not officially nominated until the next night.\n\nIn July 2009, the Lingle Administration ended the Hawaii Immigrant Health Initiative, a state program providing medical coverage for legal immigrants present in the United States for fewer than five years. This move included the elimination of all residents present in Hawaii under the Compact of Free Association from QUEST, the state’s Medicaid coverage plan that assists the low income population in Hawaii with their health care needs. Noting that such a policy likely constituted unlawful discrimination in violation of the Equal Protection Clause, federal district court judge John Michael Seabright issued a preliminary injunction against the implementation of the substituted health care plan. Subsequent Governor Neil Abercrombie indicated that he may continue the State's appeal of the injunction to the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit.\n\nOn April 13, 2010, two student protesters who were occupying her office were arrested and criminal trespassing citations were issued to eight others. The demonstrators were part of a sit-in to protest a school furlough policy implemented due to budget shortages. The following day, April 14, two more protesters were arrested and citations were issued to five other protesters.\n\nLingle on July 6, 2010 vetoed Hawaii House Bill 444, which would have allowed for civil unions for couples in Hawaii, arguing the issue should be decided by referendum. The bill had passed the State House with three votes less than the two-thirds vote threshold necessary to override the veto, although the bill met that threshold in the State Senate.\n\nIn October 2011, Lingle said on KSSK radio show that she would run for the open seat vacated by retiring U.S. Senator Daniel Akaka (D-HI). She won the Republican primary election on August 11, 2012 against nominal opposition and faced Hirono in the general election – a repeat of the 2002 gubernatorial race.\n\nLingle was the first reasonably well-funded Republican to run for the Senate in Hawaii since Pat Saiki ran in the 1990 special election against Akaka, and the strongest Republican candidate for a full term in the Senate from the state in memory. Although a poll in the summer of 2012 showed the race as close as five points, ultimately Hirono defeated Lingle with 63 percent of the vote to Lingle's 37 percent.\n\nAfter her failed Senate bid, Lingle taught a public policy seminar at California State University, Northridge, from which she had graduated in 1975. She also gave lectures and worked with the Governor's Council and Energy Security Council for the Bipartisan Policy Center.\n\nIn January 2015, Lingle was appointed as a senior adviser to Illinois Governor Bruce Rauner. She was to join a trio of outsiders in May/June 2015 to work on problems such as the state's retirement system and low credit ratings. Lingle left the chief operating officer position in July 2016. Weeks later, she delivered an opening-day speech at the 2016 Republican National Convention about Jewish support for the party and its presidential nominee.\n\nIn January 2017, Lingle announced at a Republican gathering that she planned to move back to Hawaii in April 2017. In May 2017, she was one of four former governors brought together by Harvard University to discuss issues related to the nation's opioid crisis. Lingle became a member of Hawaii Pacific University's board of trustees in June 2017.\n\nLingle was married and divorced twice. She married her first husband, Charles Lingle, while in college, in 1972. Upon leaving California for Hawaii, she divorced him in 1975 but kept the Lingle name. During her term as mayor of Maui County, Lingle divorced her second husband, Maui attorney William Crockett, to whom she was married from 1986 to 1997. Lingle is currently single and does not have any children.\n\nHer uncle founded the Cutter Ford car dealerships in Hawaii.\n\nLingle is active in the Republican Jewish Coalition, serving as a speaker at events and otherwise using her role as the only Jewish Republican US governor.\nPresident George W. Bush appointed her to serve on the Honorary Delegation to accompany him to Jerusalem for the celebration of the 60th anniversary of the State of Israel in May 2008.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "36349086", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=36349086", "title": "Martin Bayerle", "text": "Martin Bayerle\n\nCaptain Martin Gerard Bayerle (born April 23, 1951) is an American treasure hunter and author, best known for finding the 1909 shipwreck of the White Star Liner RMS Republic. He is also star of the History Channel show \"Billion Dollar Wreck.\" The \"Republic\" was the largest ship to sink in history to her day, only to be eclipsed by the loss of RMS Titanic in 1912. Capt. Bayerle and his company, Martha's Vineyard Scuba Headquarters, Inc. (\"MAVIS\") were referred to as \"modern day pirates\" but in a complimentary sense by Judge Nancy Gertner of the United States District Court, District of Massachusetts in a 2005 opinion granting exclusive salvage rights to the \"Republic\" to MAVIS. MAVIS subsequently acquired legal title to the RMS Republic shipwreck and her contents in August 2011, with the U.S. District Court of Boston also barring all future claims.\n\nMartin was born in St. Albans Naval Hospital in Queens, New York, and grew up in the Brighton Beach neighborhood of Brooklyn, New York. His father, Gerard, was a lawyer and lieutenant colonel in the U.S. Army Reserve. His mother, Ruth, was a German immigrant who came to the United States following World War II. Martin lost sight in his left eye from a small explosives accident when he was 11 years old. He first began scuba diving off the coast of New Jersey and New York at the age of 15 and went on to graduate from Abraham Lincoln High School in February 1969.\n\nMartin attended Brooklyn College in New York from 1969 through 1972 where he majored in Geology. He taught scuba diving as a student and adjunct professor within the Adult Education Department; during his time there until he opened up a dive shop - Brooklyn Divers Supply Corp. – in 1972. He began running dive operations to local shipwreck sites, such as the \"Mistletoe\", \"Black Warrior\", \"USS Turner (DD-648)\", \"Oregon\", and \"U-853\", among others. He trained about 1,200 people how to scuba dive and became a Master PADI SCUBA instructor in 1975 (# M1761).\n\nBrooklyn Divers was operated successfully until 1978, when the company’s source of supply and advertisements was abruptly cut off. Martin sued eight SCUBA company defendants for price fixing conspiracy under the Sherman Act and reached a six-figure settlement once the case went to trial in federal court in the Southern District of New York (\"Brooklyn Diver Supply Corp. v ScubaPro, Petersen Publications, Dacor, NASDS ...\" – and other major components of the sport SCUBA diving industry). Martin then closed up his Brooklyn operations and moved to Martha’s Vineyard, Massachusetts. There he obtained a captain’s license, pilot’s license, and established Martha’s Vineyard Scuba Headquarters, Inc. (MAVIS) to serve as a base of operations to attempt to locate the fabled shipwreck of the RMS \"Republic\". The \"Republic\" was the largest ship to sink in history when she sank off the U.S. East Coast in January 1909 and was rumored to be carrying a vast cargo of gold.\n\nAfter two and a half years of preparatory research to determine the wreck’s location, Capt. Bayerle discovered the wreck of the RMS \"Republic\" in 1981. He raised investor capital and purchased the assets from a bankrupt Canadian offshore oil rig support company, Wolf Sub-Ocean Ltd., in addition to the purchase of a 285 ft Diving Support Vessel, the \"Oil Endeavor\" (renamed the \"SOSI Inspector\") in the years following the find. Martin also married during those years and he and his wife, Susan, gave birth to two children – a daughter, Tessa, and a son, Grant. During the summer of 1987, Martin went out to perform a major salvage on the \"Republic\" to try to recover the gold, an event that generated international media attention. Capt. Bayerle was featured on television programs such as \"CBS Evening News,\" \"ABC Evening News\", and \"ABC Good Morning America\". The 74-day salvage was also closely followed in international periodicals, such as \"Forbes,\" \"New York Times,\" \"Associated Press,\" \"Japan Times\", \"London Times,\" and the \"Los Angeles Times\" among many other major publications.\n\nThe 1987 salvage effort was successful in targeting and excavating their target area, but failed to locate the gold, however. The crew excavated the target area but ended up in the ship’s wine locker, finding hundreds of pre-1900 bottles of wine and champagne. Once they realized they were in the wine locker rather than the specie room, Capt. Bayerle flew to London and appeared on ITV and BBC radio, offering a £25,000 reward for the construction plans of the \"Republic\". No one came forth with the plans to the ship, however, and the salvage was terminated for lack of funds. Despite many years of research and effort, the plans to the ship still have never been found.\n\nFollowing the salvage attempt, the 1987 joint venture disbanded and any artifacts brought up were sold at auction. Martin moved to Clarksburg, West Virginia, to live with his in-laws, the Youngs, on a small farm. He finished his undergraduate education, earning B.Sc. and B.Sc.B.Adm. magna cum laude degrees from Fairmont State College and went on to start his M.B.A. education from West Virginia University. He was accepted into the WVU College of Law in the fall of 1990 but would not complete his legal education there, however, as other personal events intervened.\n\nOn April 6, 1991, Bayerle shot and killed 38-year old Stefano Robotti, the 'lover' of his alienated wife Susan, near Clarksburg, West Virginia. He argued that he \"was protecting his family,\" although a legal and justifiable homicide defense of self or defense of family was not offered to the jury as an option. Evidence of the sexual exploitation of Bayerle's wife and children by the deceased was presented at trial. After a six-week trial, the jury vacillated between involuntary (a misdemeanor) and voluntary manslaughter, and found him guilty of voluntary manslaughter; Bayerle was sentenced to one to five years in State prison. He completed his sentence, with good time, in two-and-a-half years.\n\nUpon his release, Capt. Bayerle continued school in Morgantown, West Virginia, to complete his M.B.A. education in order to add credibility and depth to his research. There, he started up an Internet Service Provider business that he ran for five years and established IDEA, the Internet Development and Exchange Association. Capt. Bayerle moved back to Manhattan, New York City, in 2002 to continue his years of research into the rumored gold cargo aboard the Republic. From that research, he refined a trademarked Third Theory that identified the $3,000,000 1909-value secret transaction on board that was being shipped to the Tsar of Russia, “Bloody” Nicholas II, a gold cargo that today may be worth in excess of two billion dollars.\n\nCapt. Bayerle subsequently started an archival research company specializing in retrieving records from government archives. His old company, MAVIS, has since acquired legal title to the wreck of the RMS \"Republic\" and her contents, with the court also barring all future claims. After acquiring ownership of Republic, on August 1, 2013, Bayerle published the bulk of his significant research into the mystery of RMS Republic by releasing a book titled \"The Tsar's Treasure: The Sunken White Star Liner With a Billion Dollar Secret.\" In 2013, MAVIS retained Etoile Blanc Consulting, LLC to manage investment and media properties related to the RMS Republic recovery. Investment opportunities are made available to Accredited Investors through Lords Of Fortune LLC. Captain Bayerle's personal life is also the subject of an upcoming non-fiction book series, with the first book of the trilogy planned for release in mid-2018. Plans to adapt the series into feature films are also in development. MAVIS is currently preparing for a major recovery operation of the wreck planned for the summer seasons of 2018–2021.\n\n"}

Mohamed Khouna Ould Haidallah ( \"Muḥammad Khouna Wald Haidallah\") (born 1940) was the head of state of Mauritania (Chairman of the Military Committee for National Salvation, CMSN) from 4 January 1980 to 12 December 1984. He was an unsuccessful candidate in the 2003 presidential election and the 2007 presidential election.\n\nBorn in 1940 in the Nouadhibou region (either in then-Spanish Sahara or colonial Mauritania), into a family of the Sahrawi \"Laaroussien\" tribe, he passed to secondary education in Rosso near the border to French-administered Senegal. He earned a baccalaureat in science in Dakar, Senegal, in 1961. After joining the Mauritanian army in 1962, he studied in French military colleges, notably Saint-Cyr.\n\nAfter 1975, he commanded forces in the north of Mauritania and Tiris al-Gharbiya (Western Sahara), in the war against Polisario Front guerrillas, notably in the Zouerate region and Bir Moghrein. In 1978, with the country in severe disorder, he participated in a coup d'état that overthrew Mauritanian President Mokhtar Ould Daddah. As a member of the CRMN military junta, he was promoted to the post of Chief of the General Staff.\n\nHaidallah became prime minister on 31 May 1979, a few days after the death in an airplane crash of the previous prime minister, Col. Ahmed Ould Bouceif, with whom he had seized power for the CMSN just a month earlier, from Col. Mustafa Ould Salek and the CRMN. In January 1980 he seized power from Ould Salek's successor as head of state, Mohamed Mahmoud Ould Louly. He continued to also hold the position of Prime Minister until December of that year, when a civilian, Sid Ahmed Ould Bneijara, was appointed to the post.\n\nHis reign was marked by severe political turbulence, as Mauritania extracted itself from the war with the Polisario Front — started by Ould Daddah in 1975 — and his regime faced a number of coup attempts and military intrigues. On March 16, 1981 a coup attempt against Haidalla failed. Haidalla accused Morocco of being behind the coup, which Morocco denied, and in the next month Maaouya Ould Sid'Ahmed Taya was appointed Prime Minister. Another attempted coup was allegedly sponsored by Libya.\n\nIn March 1984, Haidallah took the office of Prime Minister again, replacing Taya, in a move to strengthen his personal power. On December 12, however, Taya ousted Haidallah in a coup while the latter was out of the country. Haidalla had been at a Franco-African Summit in Burundi and learned of the coup in Brazzaville, during his return to Mauritania, from Denis Sassou Nguesso, the president of the Republic of the Congo. Haidallah returned to Mauritania anyway and was arrested at the airport in Nouakchott; he was eventually released in December 1988. Taya promised to install democracy, but his rule was considered dictatorial by many; he was deposed by a military coup in 2005.\n\nHaidallah's main achievement was to make peace with the Western Sahara-based Polisario Front, which had been fighting Mauritania since it annexed part of the former Spanish colony in 1975. The CMSN opted for complete withdrawal from the conflict, evacuating southern Rio de Oro (which had been annexed as Tiris El Gharbiya) and recognizing the POLISARIO as the representative of the Sahrawi people. This led to a crisis in relations with the country's until-then ally Morocco, which had similarly annexed the remainder of Western Sahara, with Haidallah's government facing an attempted coup, troop clashes and military tension. Relations were completely severed between 1981 and 1985, when they were restored by Haidalla's successor. However, relations improved with POLISARIO's main regional backer, Algeria, with the Algerian government sending arms and supplies to bolster his regime. Haidalla's 1984 recognition of the Sahrawi Arab Democratic Republic (SADR, the POLISARIO's government-in-exile) as a sovereign nation appears to have been one of the triggering causes for Maaouya Ould Sid'Ahmed Taya's coup in 1984.\n\nOn the domestic front, his most notable policies were the institution of Islamic sharia law in 1980-83, as well as several failed attempts to rebuild the political system shattered by the 1978 coup — first as a multiparty system, and then, after the first coup attempt against him, as a one-party state. It was also during Haidallah's rule that slavery was formally abolished in Mauritania, although the practice continues at a diminished level still today. He made a statement announcing the abolition of slavery in July 1980, and this was followed by a legal decree in November 1981. Political opponents were treated harshly, with imprisonments and those responsible for one of the failed coups against his government were executed.\n\nAfter returning to Mauritania in 1984, Haidallah was held in administrative detention for several years by Ould Taya, during which time he fell sick. After his release, he stayed outside politics until 2003, when he returned to head the opposition. He then unsuccessfully ran for president against Taya in November, campaigning on a moderately Islamist platform, whereas Taya, who had established full diplomatic ties with Israel, was considered pro-Western. Haidallah officially came in second with about 19% of the vote, although he alleged fraud; he was arrested immediately after the election, accused of plotting a coup. Haidallah had also been briefly detained just prior to the vote. On December 28, 2003 he received a five-year suspended sentence and therefore was set free, but barred from politics for five years. An appeals court confirmed this sentence in April 2004. Also in April, his supporters attempted to register a political party, the Party for Democratic Convergence.\n\nHaidalla was arrested again on November 3, 2004, accused of involvement in coup plots. The prosecutor sought a five-year prison sentence, but he was acquitted on February 3, 2005 at the end of a mass trial of 195 people.\n\nFollowing a military coup against Taya in August 2005, an amnesty in early September freed Haidallah from his sentence, along with more than a hundred others sentenced for political offenses. On December 27, 2006, Haidalla announced that he would be a candidate in the presidential election scheduled for March 11, 2007. He campaigned on a nationalist-Islamist platform, citing the struggle against poverty and slavery as priorities. On February 3, he gained the support of another registered presidential candidate, former opposition politician and prisoner under Ould Taya, Chbih Ould Cheikh Melainine, who dropped out of the race.\n\nHowever, no longer having the political base that came with being the main candidate of the opposition under Ould Taya, Haidallah was even less successful in the 2007 election, coming in tenth place and receiving 1.73% of the vote.\n\nAfter the election, which was won by Sidi Ould Cheikh Abdallahi, Haidalla announced his support for Abdallahi in October 2007. However, following the coup that ousted Abdallahi in August 2008, Haidalla expressed his support for the coup in a statement on August 29, 2008, saying that it was necessary under the circumstances and urging all Mauritanians to support it. He also criticized the negative reactions of Western governments to the coup, alleging that they were interfering in Mauritanian affairs.\n\nIn July 2007, Sidi Mohamed Uld Haidalla (Mohamed Khouna's son) was detained in Morocco for drug trafficking charges. In 2008 he was judged and condemned to 7 years in prison.\n\nOn June 18, 2010, Haidallah wrote an open letter to the heads of state who have good relations with the king of Morocco, requesting for help to bring his son back to Mauritania or to liberate him. He denounces the conditions of imprisonment of his son, who is handicapped. On June 24, 2010, El Ghassem Uld Bellali, a Mauritanian deputy, declared that the imprisonment of Sidi Mohamed Uld Haidalla is a Moroccan \"political vengeance\" against Haidalla's father, for the recognition he gaved to the SADR and to the right of self-determination of the Sahrawi people, when he was president of Mauritania.\n\n \n"}

He was Vogt of Bruges and governor of Damme. He participated in the battles around Hulst, Kallo and Antwerp.\n\nPaul-Bernard de Fontaine was the son of Francisco de Fontaine, Lord of Cierges, rider-chief, governor of Stenay, administrator of the Duke of Lorraine, and Suzanne d'Urre. Both died before Fontaine had finished his first year. His maternal grandfather, Jean d'Urre, master of Thessières, took care of him until, in 1584, he resigned his guardianship, he was 87 years old and died two years later, and gave his oldest son Charles.\nIn 1636, together with his wife, Anna de Ragicourt, he founded a chapel and almshouse in the Zwarteleertouwersstraat in Bruges for twelve impoverished soldiers. His coat of arms is placed over the door in the side wall. The building was used until 1914 according to the foundations and is now a monument. At the St. Walburga church at Damme he donated a main altar bearing his coat of arms.\n\nIn 1596, he joined the King of Spain as a volunteer, and subsequently made a military career.

{"id": "10471889", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=10471889", "title": "Salih ibn Mirdas", "text": "Salih ibn Mirdas\n\nAbū ʿAlī Ṣāliḥ ibn Mirdās, also known by the \"laqab\" (honorific epithet) Asad al-Dawla (\"Lion of the State\") (died May 1029), was the founder of the Mirdasid dynasty of Aleppo, ruling between 1025 until his death. At its peak, his emirate (principality) encompassed much of the western Jazira, northern Syria and a string of central Syrian towns. With occasional interruption, Salih's descendants would rule Aleppo for the next five decades.\n\nSalih launched his career in 1008/09 when he seized al-Rahba on the Euphrates River. In 1012, he was imprisoned and tortured by the emir of Aleppo, Mansur ibn Lu'lu; two years later, he escaped, captured Mansur in battle and released him in return for numerous concessions, including half of Aleppo's revenues. This action cemented Salih as the paramount emir of his Banu Kilab tribe, many of whose chieftains had died in Mansur's dungeons. With his Bedouin warriors, Salih captured a string of fortresses along the Euphrates, including Manbij and Raqqa, by 1022. He later formed an alliance with the Banu Kalb and Banu Tayy and militarily supported their struggle against the Fatimids. During this tribal rebellion, Salih annexed the central Syrian towns of Hims, Ba'albak and Sidon before finally conquering Fatimid-held Aleppo in 1025.\n\nSalih established a well-organized administration over his Aleppo-based domains. Militarily, he relied on the Banu Kilab, while entrusting fiscal administration to his local Christian vizier, policing to an urban militia commander and judicial matters to a Shia Muslim \"qāḍī\". His rule was officially tolerated by the Fatimids, to whom he paid formal allegiance. However, his alliance with the Banu Tayy ultimately drew him into conflict with the Fatimid general, Anushtakin al-Dizbari, whose forces killed Salih in battle near Lake Tiberias. Salih was succeeded by his sons Thimal and Nasr.\n\nThe year of Salih ibn Mirdas's birth is not known. Both of Salih's parents belonged to noble households of the Bedouin (nomadic Arab) tribe of Banu Kilab. His father was a certain Mirdas ibn Idris who hailed from a princely clan of the Kilab, specifically from the Rabi'ah ibn Ka'b line of the 'Abd Allah ibn Abu Bakr branch. Nothing else is known about Mirdas. Salih's mother, Rabab al-Zawqaliyah, came from the princely Kilabi clan of Zawqal, which inhabited the environs of Aleppo. Salih had at least three brothers, only one of whom, Kamil, is named in sources and at least four sons, Nasr (d. 1038), Thimal (d. 1062), Atiyya (d. 1071/72) and the youngest whose name is not known (d. 1029).\n\nSalih's family inhabited and controlled the town of Qinnasrin (Chalcis), to the southwest of Aleppo. Like most Muslims in Aleppo in the 10th–11th centuries, the Kilab embraced Shia Islam. Although it is not clear how strongly the tribesmen identified with their faith, Salih's \"kunya\" (paedonymic), \"Abu Ali\" (father of Ali), honored Ali ibn Abi Talib, a central figure in Shia tradition.\n\nThe Kilab were a major sub-tribe of the Banu 'Amir and first migrated to Syria from central Arabia during the 7th-century Muslim conquest. They soon became a pillar of the Qaysi tribal faction and established their strongholds in the Jazira (Upper Mesopotamia) and the steppes around Aleppo, which they thenceforth considered their \"diyār\" (tribal territory). Through their military strength and consistent ambition to govern and keep order in the territories they inhabited, the Kilab persisted as a powerful force in northern Syria throughout the following centuries. In 932–933, another mass wave of Kilabi tribesmen moved to the environs of Aleppo as soldiers of an invading Qarmatian army; according to historian Suhayl Zakkar, the new arrivals \"paved the way to the rise and establishment of the Mirdasid dynasty\". By then, the Kilab had established itself as the dominant tribal force in northern Syria and played a significant role in all the uprisings and internecine fighting involving the Hamdanid rulers of Aleppo, between 945 and 1002.\n\nSalih is first mentioned in 1008 in relation to the power struggle over the Euphrates fortress town of al-Rahba. The latter was strategically situated at the crossroads between Syria and Iraq and frequently contested by local and regional powers. In 1008, Ibn Mihkan, a native of al-Rahba, expelled its Fatimid governor and sought Salih's military backing to uphold his rule. Salih continued to dwell in his tribe's desert encampment and it is not known what he received in exchange for protecting Ibn Mihkan. A dispute soon arose between Salih and Ibn Mihkan, leading the former to besiege al-Rahba. \n\nThe hostilities came to an end following an agreement that stipulated Salih's marriage to Ibn Mihkan's daughter and Ibn Mihkan's relocation to Anah, which he would rule in addition to al-Rahba. When Anah's inhabitants revolted against Ibn Mihkan, Salih intervened to reassert his father-in-law's rule. However, amid these developments Ibn Mihkan was assassinated; contemporary chroniclers presume Salih ordered his death. Salih proceeded to capture al-Rahba and proclaim his allegiance to the Fatimid caliph, al-Hakim. This marked \"the first step in Salih's career and from which his ambition probably evolved\", according to Zakkar. Salih's capture of al-Rahba most likely boosted his prestige among the Kilab.\n\nBetween 1009 and 1012, the Kilab participated in the struggle between Aleppo’s ruler Mansur ibn Lu'lu' and the Hamdanids and their regional backers for control of Aleppo. Twice the Kilab betrayed the Hamdanids and their allies, and in return, demanded from Mansur numerous pastures to breed their flocks and war horses. Instead, Mansur, who viewed the Kilab as a hindrance to his rule, strove to eliminate them by luring the tribesmen into a trap. To that end, on 27 May 1012, he invited them to a feast and once the tribesmen entered his palace, the gates were locked and Mansur and his \"ghilmān\" (slave soldiers; sing. \"ghulām\") attacked them. Several were killed and the rest, including Salih, were imprisoned in the citadel of Aleppo. Afterward, the Kilabi emir Muqallid ibn Za'ida besieged the town of Kafartab to gain leverage with Mansur. This prompted the latter to move the Kilabi prisoners to facilities with better conditions in case of future peace negotiations with Muqallid. However, upon hearing of Muqallid's death and his failed siege, Mansur returned the prisoners to the citadel's dungeons, where many among them, including some chieftains, were executed or died of torture or poor conditions.\n\nSalih was among those tortured by Mansur. Moreover, Salih was forced to divorce his wife and cousin Tarud, who was famed for her beauty, so that Mansur could wed her. Zakkar writes that it is not known whether this was meant to humiliate Salih, \"an energetic and bold\" emir, or to establish marital ties with other elements of the Kilab. Mansur frequently threatened to execute Salih, who upon being informed of these threats, escaped the citadel. According to the versions of medieval chroniclers, Salih managed to cut one of his shackles and make a hole in his cell wall. Then, on the night of 3 July 1014, he jumped from the wall of the citadel with one shackle still attached to his leg and hid in a drain pipe for the remainder of the night until re-joining his tribesmen at their encampment in Marj Dabiq. Zakkar questions the truth of this story, and asserts it was more likely that Salih escaped either through bribery or a friendly arrangement with a guard.\n\nSalih's escape boosted the Kilab's morale and they assembled to offer him their allegiance. In the following days, the Kilab under Salih besieged Aleppo, but Mansur's forces were able to plunder Salih's camp and capture fifty tribesmen. Buoyed by his victory, Mansur collected his army of \"ghilmān\" in Aleppo along with local toughs, Christians and Jews and confronted Salih's forces on the outskirts of Aleppo. The Kilab routed their opponents, killing some 2,000 Aleppines in the process, and captured Mansur. Negotiations between Salih and Mansur's representatives ensued, concluding with an agreement that freed Mansur in return for the release of Salih's brothers, a ransom of 50,000 gold dinars and the allotment of half of the Emirate of Aleppo's revenues to the Kilab. Salih was also able to remarry Tarud and was given Mansur's daughter to wed as well. Furthermore, Mansur recognized Salih as the supreme emir of the Kilab, formally investing him with authority and control over his tribesmen.\n\nUsing his newfound power, Salih captured the Euphrates towns of Manbij and Balis, located east and southeast of Aleppo, respectively. With these conquests and his control of al-Rahba, Salih established what would become the Upper Mesopotamian portion of the Mirdasid emirate. This crossroads region was agriculturally, commercially and strategically valuable, and put Salih in contact with the Byzantines, the Fatimids and the rulers of Iraq.\n\nMeanwhile, the agreement between Salih and Mansur fell through as the latter abandoned most of his promises to Salih, including giving his daughter's hand in marriage and according the Kilab their share of Aleppo's revenues. Salih retaliated by besieging Aleppo, while the Kilab and their Bedouin allies plundered the countryside. Mansur appealed for Byzantine intervention and warned Emperor Basil II that if left unchecked, the Bedouin uprising could spread to his territory. Basil dispatched 1,000 Armenian relief troops in response, but withdrew them after Salih informed him of Mansur's treachery and pledged his goodwill to the Byzantines. Basil may have also acquiesced to Salih to avoid provoking Bedouin raids against his territory as the emirates of both the Kilab and their Numayri kinsmen bordered the Byzantines. The withdrawal of Byzantine troops weakened Mansur's position further and strengthened Salih, who dispatched one of his sons to Constantinople to pay allegiance to Basil.\n\nIn January 1016, Mansur fled Aleppo after the citadel commander, Fath al-Qal'i, revolted and recognized Salih's emirate and Caliph al-Hakim's suzerainty over Aleppo. According to Aleppine chroniclers, the revolt was coordinated with Salih, who was restored his share of Aleppo's revenues and given custody of the mother, wives and daughters of Mansur; Salih immediately sent the women to join Mansur, but kept one of the latter's daughters, whom he married. Mansur's ouster and the subsequent disorder in northern Syria drove Basil to halt all travel and trade with Syria and Egypt, but Salih persuaded him to exempt Aleppo and the Kilab from these sanctions.\n\nTo secure his hold over Aleppo, Fath invited Fatimid troops from Afamiyah led by Ali al-Dayf. Al-Hakim requested Salih to cooperate with al-Dayf and bestowed on him the title of \"asad al-dawla\" (lion of the state). However, Salih opposed the Fatimid presence in Aleppo and proposed an arrangement to Fath giving the latter control of the citadel and the Kilab control of the city. Fath responded favorably, but Aleppo's inhabitants protested the rumored deal, demanding the establishment of Fatimid rule; they enjoyed al-Hakim's tax exemptions and opposed Bedouin governance. Fath was compelled to relocate to Tyre by al-Hakim, who also sent more troops to Aleppo. Salih was thus prevented from seizing the city. Nonetheless, Mansur's flight and the instability of Fatimid rule enabled Salih to strengthen his Upper Mesopotamian emirate. He established his own administration and tribal court. As early as 1019, the court was visited by the Arab poet Ibn Abi Hasina, who would become a prominent eulogist of the Mirdasid dynasty.\n\nMeanwhile, al-Hakim appointed Aziz al-Dawla, an Armenian \"ghulām\", governor of Aleppo in 1017. Aziz al-Dawla established friendly relations with Salih and had the latter's mother live in Aleppo to strengthen ties. There is no mention of Salih's activities during Aziz al-Dawla's five-year reign; according to Zakkar, this indicated that Salih \"was satisfied and remained contented\" throughout this period. Though Salih was not strong enough to challenge the Fatimids, the Kilab were nonetheless given control of the plains around Aleppo by Aziz al-Dawla. By 1022, Salih had extended his rule to the Euphrates twin towns of Raqqa and al-Rafiqah. In July of that year, Aziz al-Dawla was assassinated and briefly replaced by Abu'l-Najm Badr, his Turkish \"ghulām\". This was followed by a succession of governors with short terms, the last being Thu'ban ibn Muhammad and Mawsuf al-Saqlabi as governors of the city and citadel, respectively.\n\nAziz al-Dawla's replacements were challenged by Salih and chaos prevailed in Aleppo. In 1023, Salih entered the Kilab into a military pact with the Banu Tayy of Transjordan and the Banu Kalb of central Syria, both of which opposed direct Fatimid rule. Medieval historian Yahya al-Antaki relates that the alliance was a renewal of a previous pact made by the same parties in circa 1021, during which they rebelled and ultimately reconciled with the new Fatimid caliph, az-Zahir (r. 1021–1036), who took power in the aftermath of Caliph al-Hakim's disappearance in 1021. However, the reconciliation unraveled by 1023 due to the Tayy's conflict with Palestine's Fatimid governor, Anushtakin al-Dizbari, which prompted the respective chieftains of Tayy and Kalb, Hassan ibn Mufarrij and Sinan ibn Ulayyan, to meet with Salih at the outskirts of Aleppo and renew the alliance.\n\nAccording to the terms of the pact, Syria would be split into three Bedouin-run states, with the Kilab under Salih governing Aleppo and northern Syria, the Tayy under its princely Jarrahid household ruling Palestine from al-Ramla, and the Kalb ruling central Syria from Damascus. The combined strength of the three largest tribes in Syria made them a formidable challenge to the Fatimids. A Bedouin alliance of this magnitude and nature had not occurred since the 7th century and was made without consideration to the traditional Qays–Yaman rivalry between the tribes; the Tayy and Kalb were both Yamani while the Kilab were Qaysi. Moreover, its formation surprised Syria's population at the time, who were unaccustomed to the spectacle of Bedouin chiefs seeking kingship in the cities rather than nomadic life in the desert fringe. According to Zakkar, \"Salih was the outstanding figure among the allies, particularly from a military standpoint\", though Hassan ibn Mufarrij apparently managed the allies' communications with the Fatimids.\n\nIn 1023, Salih and his Kilabi forces headed south and helped the Tayy evict Anushtakin's Fatimid troops from the interior regions of Palestine. Afterward, Salih assisted the Kalbi siege of Damascus. The Tayy and Kalb's revolts in Palestine and \"Jund Dimashq\" (Damascus Province), respectively, \"supplied the impetus\", according to Zakkar, for Salih to move on Aleppo, particularly as the Fatimids' grip on that city was unstable. While Salih was fighting alongside his allies in the south, his \"kātib\" (secretary), Sulayman ibn Tawq, captured Maarrat Misrin in Aleppo's southern countryside from its Fatimid governor. In November 1023, Salih returned to Aleppo in the belief that its defenders would immediately surrender to him, but this did not occur. Salih then withdrew and mobilized his tribal warriors and other local Bedouin.\n\nIn October 1024, Salih's forces, led by Ibn Tawq, advanced against Aleppo and fought in sporadic engagements with the Fatimid troops of governors Thu'ban and Mawsuf. Salih himself arrived at Aleppo—after having sacked several Syrian coastal districts—with large numbers of Bedouin warriors on 22 November. He besieged the city, first camping outside of Bab al-Jinan, where his demand that Ibn Abi Usama, the city's \"qāḍī\" (head Islamic judge), and other notables surrender was refused. Salih then gathered more troops and engaged Aleppo's defenders for over fifty days, resulting in heavy casualties on both sides. On 18 January 1025, the Bab Qinnasrin gate was opened to Salih by Salim ibn al-Mustafad, head of the city's surviving Hamdanid \"ghilmān\"; Ibn Mustafad had defected from the Fatimids after a quarrel with Mawsuf, and together with numerous townsmen and other former \"ghilmān\", he welcomed Salih, who granted the inhabitants safe conduct. Afterward, Salih had the towers of the city's walls demolished. According to the Egyptian contemporary chronicler al-Musabbihi, this led the local populace to believe Salih was preparing to hand over Aleppo to the Byzantines; fearing this, they fought alongside Fatimid troops and temporarily ousted Salih's forces, killing some 250 Kilabi warriors. Zakkar views Salih's destruction of Aleppo's walls as a tactical move that would enable an easier reconquest of the city should his troops be ousted.\n\nSalih besieged the citadel, where Mawsuf and his troops were held up, on 23 January, while Thu'ban and his garrison barricaded themselves in the governor's palace at the foot of the citadel. By 13 March, Salih managed to enter the palace and allowed the townspeople to loot it. Salih's Bedouin troops were not accustomed to siege warfare and Salih requested skilled forces from the Byzantine governor of Antioch, Constantine Dalassenos, who dispatched three hundred bowmen to Aleppo; however, the Byzantine troops were quickly withdrawn on the orders of Emperor Basil II, who did not support Salih's rebellion. On 5 May, Salih appointed Ibn Mustafad \"muqaddam al-aḥdāth\" (commander of the local militia) and governor of Aleppo and entrusted him and Ibn Tawq with continuing the siege, while Salih left for Palestine to help the Tayy combat a renewed expedition by Anushtakin. The Fatimid garrison's appeal for a truce on 6 June was ignored, prompting their desperate calls for Byzantine assistance; the troops went so far as to hang Christian crosses on the citadel walls and loudly praise Basil II while cursing Caliph az-Zahir. Muslim townsmen reacted to the pro-Byzantine pleas by joining the siege. By 30 June, the citadel was breached and Mawsuf and Thu'ban were arrested.\n\nMeanwhile, Salih and the Tayy fended off Fatimid troops in Palestine. On his way back to Aleppo, Salih captured a string of towns and fortresses, namely Ba'albak west of Damascus, Hims and Rafaniyya in central Syria, Sidon on the Mediterranean coast and Hisn Ibn Akkar in the hinterland of Tripoli. These strategically valuable towns gave Salih's emirate an outlet to the sea and control of part of the caravan route between Aleppo and Damascus. The fall of Sidon particularly alarmed the Fatimids, who largely prioritized control of Syria's port cities over the inland towns and who feared that other ports would recognize Bedouin rule.\n\nIn September, Salih entered Aleppo's citadel victoriously. Afterward, he had Mawsuf and the \"qāḍī\" Ibn Abi Usama executed. However, Salih released Thu'ban in return for financial compensation and allowed the city's \"dāʿī\" (chief Isma'ili propagandist) to depart safely. Salih also confiscated the estates of numerous upper class Aleppines.\n\nDespite his rebellion, Salih paid formal allegiance to the Fatimid Caliphate after conquering Aleppo, and dispatched Ibn Tawq to meet az-Zahir in Cairo; in turn, az-Zahir officially recognized Salih's Mirdasid emirate and sent him numerous honorary robes and presents. There is no information about the Byzantines' relationship with Salih following the conquest of Aleppo, though Emperor Basil II refused to back Salih's rebellion when he appealed for Byzantine support.\n\nAccording to the 13th-century historian Ibn al-'Amid, \"Salih put in order all [the state] matters and adopted the way of justice\". Salih organized his emirate along the lines of a medieval Islamic state. To that end, he maintained the fiscal administration, appointed a \"wazīr\" (vizier) to administer civilian and military affairs, and a Shia \"qāḍī\" to oversee judicial matters. He also appointed deputies to govern Sidon, Ba'albak, Hims, Rafaniyya and Hisn Ibn Akkar.\n\nSalih's \"wazīr\" was a Christian named Tadrus ibn al-Hasan, who wielded significant influence over him, according to Ibn al-'Adim, and accompanied Salih on all of his military campaigns. Aleppine Christians would largely monopolize the post of \"wazīr\" under later Mirdasid rulers, and members of the community managed significant parts of the emirate's economy. Their major role in the emirate indicated Salih's reliance on local Christian support, the existence of a large Christian minority in Aleppo and an effort to establish friendly ties with the Byzantines.\n\nInformation is largely absent regarding any major administrative changes Salih made to the Emirate of Aleppo. His only known institutional innovation was the post of \"shaykh al-dawla\" (chieftain of the state) or \"raʾīs al-balad\" (municipal chief), who served as Salih's trusted confidant and permanent representative with the people of Aleppo. The post emulated that of the \"shaykh\", who played a secondary role to an \"amīr\" in a princely Kilabi clan. The \"shaykh al-dawla\" played an important political role in the city and came from a prominent leading family. Salih assigned Ibn Mustafad to the post and utilized the \"aḥdāth\", which consisted of young armed men from the city's lower and middle classes, as a police force. Although they cooperated with Salih, the \"aḥdāth\" were still an independent force. Sometime during his reign, Salih also acquired a number of Turkish \"ghilmān\", though details about them are lacking in the sources.\n\nAccording to historian Thierry Bianquis, Salih had \"brought to success the plan which guided his [Kilabi] forebears for a century\", and that he ruled with \"concern for order and respectability\". At its core, Salih's emirate was held together by Kilabi tribal solidarity, and indeed the Kilab were the backbone of the Mirdasid army. Though Salih previously established his paramountcy over the Kilabi chieftains, the Mirdasids were not the only princely clan of the Kilab and several emirs from other clans demanded a stake in the emirate. Salih granted each of these emirs an \"iqtāʿ\" (fief; pl. \"iqtāʿat\"), though details about the size or specific holders of the \"iqtāʿat\" are absent in contemporary sources.\n\nBedouin customs were a conspicuous part of Salih's rule and he always appeared publicly in the garb of a Bedouin chieftain rather than that of an urban leader. Moreover, Salih preferred to live in his tribal camp in the outskirts of Aleppo rather than the city itself. After his establishment in Aleppo, Salih's status increased among the Bedouin of Syria and Mesopotamia. He was sometimes referred to by Arabic chroniclers as \"amīr ʿarab al-Shām\" (commander of the Bedouin of Syria); the value of this title during Salih's time is not clear, but it \"at least indicate[d] the high position of its holder\", according to Zakkar.\n\nBesides his leadership of the Kilab and influence over the Tayy and Kalb in Syria, Salih's influence also extended to tribes in the Jazira, including the Numayr. When two Numayri emirs lost Edessa to Nasr al-Dawla, the Marwanid emir of Mayyafariqin, they appealed for Salih's intervention; accordingly, Salih persuaded Nasr to restore Edessa to the Numayr. Furthermore, the Banu Munqidh first emerged as a political force in the Orontes valley under Salih's patronage in 1024/25. At that time, Salih awarded the Munqhidi chieftain Muqallad ibn Nasr ibn Munqidh the feudal lands around Shayzar as an \"iqtāʿ\" for backing Salih's conquest of Aleppo; the town of Shayzar itself was controlled by the Byzantines, however.\n\nBetween 1025 and 1028, the Fatimids reached an agreement with Salih's Jarrahid/Tayyi allies, allowing them to maintain their foothold in interior Palestine, while Anushtakin was recalled to Cairo. In contrast to the Mirdasids, the Tayy consistently plundered their territory and its inhabitants. Moreover, the Fatimids would not tolerate independent rule in Palestine, which they viewed as a threat to the Caliphate's survival.\n\nMeanwhile, as the Fatimids regrouped, the Kalb had been repelled from Damascus, and in 1028, their emir died. He was replaced by his nephew, Rafi ibn Abi'l Layl, who defected to the Fatimids, thus weakening the tripartite Bedouin alliance. In November 1028, Anushtakin returned to Palestine with a large Fatimid army and additional horsemen from the Kalb and Banu Fazara to drive out the Tayy, and also to evict the Mirdasids from central Syria.\n\nWith the Fatimids and Kalb poised against him, Hassan appealed for Salih's help to maintain their tribes' virtual autonomy throughout Syria against Fatimid encroachment. Accordingly, Salih mobilized his Kilabi forces to reinforce the Tayy in Palestine. Salih and Hassan first encountered the Fatimid–Kalb army in the vicinity of Gaza, but, unable to halt their advance, they withdrew to the north. On 12 or 25 May 1029, the two sides fought at al-Uqhuwanah, on the eastern shores of Lake Tiberias. For unknown reasons, Hassan and his forces fled in the heat of battle, leaving Salih and his men to face off Anushtakin's army alone. The Kilab were decisively defeated and Salih, his youngest son and his vizier were slain.\n\nAfter the battle, Salih's head was sent to Cairo and put on display, while Salih's body was nailed to the gateway of Sidon, a town he had enjoyed residing in. The Fatimids went on to conquer Sidon, Ba'albak, Hims, Rafaniyya and Hisn Ibn Akkar from Salih's deputy governors, who all fled. Salih had designated his second eldest son, Thimal, as his successor and left him in charge of Aleppo. However, his eldest son, Nasr, who fought at al-Uqhuwanah, escaped the battle to wrest control of Aleppo. For a brief period, the two sons ruled Aleppo jointly with Nasr controlling the city and Thimal the citadel, until sometime in 1030 when Nasr compelled Thimal to relocate to al-Rahba. In 1038, Anushtakin killed Nasr and seized Aleppo. Thimal later restored Mirdasid rule in the city, which continued, with occasional interruption, until 1080.\n\n"}
{"id": "28123", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=28123", "title": "Sniper", "text": "Sniper\n\nA sniper is a military/paramilitary marksman who operates to maintain effective visual contact with and engage enemy targets from concealed positions or at distances exceeding the target's detection capabilities. Snipers generally have specialized training and are equipped with high-precision rifles and high-magnification optics, and often feed information back to their units or command headquarters.\n\nIn addition to marksmanship and long range shooting, military snipers are trained in a variety of tactical techniques: detection, stalking, and target range estimation methods, camouflage, field craft, infiltration, special reconnaissance and observation, surveillance and target acquisition.\n\nThe verb \"to snipe\" originated in the 1770s among soldiers in British India in reference to shooting snipes, which was considered an extremely challenging game bird for hunters.\nThe agent noun \"sniper\" appears by the 1820s. The term \"sniper\" was first attested in 1824 in the sense of the word \"sharpshooter\".\n\nA somewhat older term is \"sharp shooter\", a calque of 18th-century German \"Scharfschütze\", in use in British newspapers as early as 1801.\n\nDifferent countries use different military doctrines regarding snipers in military units, settings, and tactics.\n\nGenerally, a sniper's primary function in modern warfare is to provide detailed reconnaissance from a concealed position and, if necessary, to reduce the enemy's fighting ability by shooting high-value targets (especially officers and other key personnel) and in the process pinning down and demoralizing the enemy. Typical sniper missions include managing intelligence information they gather during reconnaissance and surveillance, target acquisition for air-strikes and artillery, assist employed combat force with fire support and counter-sniper tactics, killing enemy commanders, selecting targets of opportunity, and even destruction of military equipment, which tend to require use of anti-materiel rifles in the larger calibers such as the .50 BMG, like the Barrett M82, McMillan Tac-50, and Denel NTW-20.\n\nSoviet- and Russian-derived military doctrines include squad-level snipers. Snipers have increasingly been demonstrated as useful by US and UK forces in the recent Iraq campaign in a fire support role to cover the movement of infantry, especially in urban areas.\n\nMilitary snipers from the US, UK, and other countries that adopt their military doctrine are typically deployed in two-man sniper teams consisting of a shooter and spotter. A common practice is for a shooter and a spotter to take turns in order to avoid eye fatigue. In most recent combat operations occurring in large densely populated towns, such as Fallujah, Iraq, two teams would be deployed together to increase their security and effectiveness in an urban environment. A sniper team would be armed with its long-range weapon and a shorter-ranged weapon in case of close contact combat.\n\nThe German doctrine of largely independent snipers and emphasis on concealment, developed during the Second World War, has been most influential on modern sniper tactics, and is currently used throughout Western militaries (examples are specialized camouflage clothing, concealment in terrain and emphasis on coup d'œil).\n\nSniper rifles are classified as crew-served, as the term is used in the United States military. A sniper team (or sniper cell) consists of a combination of one or more \"shooters\" with force protection elements and support personnel: such as a \"spotter\" or a \"flanker\". Within the Table of Organization and Equipment for both the United States Army and the U.S. Marine Corps, the operator of the weapon has an assistant trained to fulfill multiple roles, in addition to being sniper-qualified in the operation of the weapon.\n\nThe shooter fires the shot while the spotter assists in observation of targets, atmospheric conditions and handles ancillary tasks as immediate security of their location, communication with other parties; including directing artillery fire and close air support. A flanker's task is to observe areas not immediately visible to the sniper or spotter and assist with the team's perimeter and rear security, therefore flankers are usually armed with an assault rifle or battle rifle. Both spotter and flanker carry additional ammunition and associated equipment.\n\nThe spotter detects, observes, and assigns targets and watches for the results of the shot. Using a spotting scope or a rangefinder, the spotter will also read the wind by using physical indicators and the mirage caused by the heat on the ground. Also, in conjunction with the shooter, the spotter will make calculations for distance, angle shooting (slant range), mil dot related calculations, correction for atmospheric conditions and leads for moving targets. It is not unusual for the spotter to be equipped with a notepad and a laptop computer specifically for performing these calculations.\n\nLaw enforcement snipers, commonly called police snipers, and military snipers differ in many ways, including their areas of operation and tactics. A police sharpshooter is part of a police operation and usually takes part in relatively short missions. Police forces typically deploy such sharpshooters in hostage scenarios. This differs from a military sniper, who operates as part of a larger army, engaged in warfare. Sometimes as part of a SWAT team, police snipers are deployed alongside negotiators and an assault team trained for close quarters combat. As policemen, they are trained to shoot only as a last resort, when there is a direct threat to life; the police sharpshooter has a well-known rule: \"Be prepared to take a life to save a life.\" Police snipers typically operate at much shorter ranges than military snipers, generally under and sometimes even less than . Both types of snipers do make difficult shots under pressure, and often perform one-shot kills.\nPolice units that are unequipped for tactical operations may rely on a specialized SWAT team, which may have a dedicated sniper. Some police sniper operations begin with military assistance. Police snipers placed in vantage points, such as high buildings, can provide security for events. In one high-profile incident, Mike Plumb, a SWAT sniper in Columbus, Ohio, prevented a suicide by shooting a revolver out of the individual's hand, leaving him unharmed.\nThe need for specialized training for police sharpshooters was made apparent in 1972 during the Munich massacre when the German police could not deploy specialized personnel or equipment during the standoff at the airport in the closing phase of the crisis, and consequently all of the Israeli hostages were killed. While the German army did have snipers in 1972, the use of army snipers in the scenario was impossible due to the German constitution's explicit prohibition of the use of the military in domestic matters. This lack of trained snipers who could be used in civilian roles was later addressed with the founding of the specialized police counter-terrorist unit GSG 9.\n\nThe longest confirmed sniper kill in combat was achieved by an undisclosed member of the Canadian JTF2 special forces in June 2017 at a distance of .\n\nThe previous record holder was Craig Harrison, a Corporal of Horse (CoH) in the Blues and Royals RHG/D of the British Army. In November 2009, Harrison struck two Taliban machine gunners consecutively south of Musa Qala in Helmand Province in Afghanistan at a range of or 1.54 miles using a L115A3 Long Range Rifle.\nThe QTU Lapua external ballistics software, using continuous doppler drag coefficient (C) data provided by Lapua, predicts that such shots traveling would likely have struck their targets after nearly 6.0 seconds of flight time, having lost 93% of their kinetic energy, retaining of their original velocity, and having dropped or 2.8° from the original bore line. Due to the extreme distances and travel time involved, even a light cross-breeze of would have diverted such shots off target, which would have required compensation.\n\nThe calculation assumes a \"flat-fire scenario\" (a situation where the shooting and target positions are at equal elevation), utilizing British military custom high-pressure .338 Lapua Magnum cartridges, loaded with 16.2 g (250 gr) Lapua LockBase B408 bullets, fired at 936 m/s (3,071 ft/s) muzzle velocity under the following on-site (average) atmospheric conditions: barometric pressure: at sea-level equivalent or on-site, humidity: 25.9%, and temperature: in the region for November 2009, resulting in an air density ρ = 1.0854 kg/m at the elevation of Musa Qala. Harrison mentions in reports that the environmental conditions were perfect for long range shooting, \"... no wind, mild weather, clear visibility.\" In a BBC interview, Harrison reported it took about nine shots for him and his spotter to initially range the target successfully.\n\nBefore the development of rifling, firearms were smoothbore and inaccurate over long distance. Barrel rifling was invented at the end of the fifteenth century, but was only employed in large cannons. Over time, rifling, along with other gunnery advances, has increased the performance of modern firearms.\n\nEarly forms of sniping or marksmanship were used during the American Revolutionary War. For instance, in 1777 at the battle of Saratoga the Colonists hid in the trees and used early model rifles to shoot British officers. Most notably, Timothy Murphy shot and killed General Simon Fraser of Balnain on 7 October 1777 at a distance of about 400 yards. During the Battle of Brandywine, Capt. Patrick Ferguson had a tall, distinguished American officer in his rifle's iron sights. Ferguson did not take the shot, as the officer had his back to Ferguson; only later did Ferguson learn that George Washington had been on the battlefield that day.\nA special unit of marksmen was established during the Napoleonic Wars in the British Army. While most troops at that time used inaccurate smoothbore muskets, the British \"Green Jackets\" (named for their distinctive green uniforms) used the famous Baker rifle. Through the combination of a leather wad and tight grooves on the inside of the barrel (rifling), this weapon was far more accurate, though slower to load. These Riflemen were the elite of the British Army, and served at the forefront of any engagement, most often in skirmish formation, scouting out and delaying the enemy. Another term, \"sharp shooter\" was in use in British newspapers as early as 1801. In the \"Edinburgh Advertiser\", 23 June 1801, can be found the following quote in a piece about the North British Militia; \"This Regiment has several Field Pieces, and two companies of Sharp Shooters, which are very necessary in the modern Stile of War\". The term appears even earlier, around 1781, in Continental Europe, translated from the German Scharfschütze.\n\nThe Whitworth rifle was arguably the first long-range sniper rifle in the world. A muzzleloader designed by Sir Joseph Whitworth, a prominent British engineer, it used polygonal rifling instead, which meant that the projectile did not have to bite into grooves as was done with conventional rifling. The Whitworth rifle was far more accurate than the Pattern 1853 Enfield, which had shown some weaknesses during the recent Crimean War. At trials in 1857 which tested the accuracy and range of both weapons, Whitworth's design outperformed the Enfield at a rate of about three to one. The Whitworth rifle was capable of hitting the target at a range of 2,000 yards, whereas the Enfield could only manage it at 1,400 yards.\n\nDuring the Crimean War, the first optical sights were designed to fit onto rifles. Much of this pioneering work was the brainchild of Colonel D. Davidson, using optical sights produced by Chance Brothers of Birmingham. This allowed a marksman to observe and target objects more accurately at a greater distance than ever before. The telescopic sight, or scope, was originally fixed and could not be adjusted, which therefore limited its range.\n\nDespite its success at the trials, the rifle was not adopted by the British Army. However, the Whitworth Rifle Company was able to sell the weapon to the French army, and also to the Confederacy during the American Civil War, where both the Union and Confederate armies employed sharpshooters. The most notable incident was during the Battle of Spotsylvania Court House, where on 9 May 1864, Union General John Sedgwick was killed by a Confederate Whitworth sharpshooter at a range of about after saying the enemy \"couldn't hit an elephant at this distance\".\n\nDuring the Boer War the latest breech-loading rifled guns with magazines and smokeless powder were used by both sides. The British were equipped with the Lee–Metford rifle, while the Boers had received the latest Mauser rifles from Germany. In the open terrain of South Africa the marksmen were a crucial component to the outcome of the battle.\n\nThe first British sniper unit began life as the Lovat Scouts, a Scottish Highland regiment formed in 1899, that earned high praise during the Second Boer War (1899–1902). The unit was formed by Lord Lovat and reported to an American, Major Frederick Russell Burnham, the British Army Chief of Scouts under Lord Roberts. Burnham fittingly described these scouts as \"half wolf and half jackrabbit.\". Just like their Boer scout opponents, these scouts were well practised in the arts of marksmanship, field craft, map reading, observation, and military tactics. They were skilled woodsmen and practitioners of discretion: \"He who shoots and runs away, lives to shoot another day.\" They were also the first known military unit to wear a ghillie suit. \nHesketh Hesketh-Prichard said of them that \"keener men never lived\", and that \"Burnham was the greatest scout of our time.\" Burnham distinguished himself in wars in South Africa, Rhodesia, and in Arizona fighting the Apaches, and his definitive work, \"Scouting on Two Continents,\" provides a dramatic and enlightening picture of what a sniper was at the time and how he operated.\n\nAfter the war, this regiment went on to formally become the first official sniper unit, then better known as \"sharpshooters\".\n\nDuring World War I, snipers appeared as deadly sharpshooters in the trenches. At the start of the war, only Imperial Germany had troops that were issued scoped sniper rifles. Although sharpshooters existed on all sides, the Germans specially equipped some of their soldiers with scoped rifles that could pick off enemy soldiers showing their heads out of their trench. At first the French and British believed such hits to be coincidental hits, until the German scoped rifles were discovered. During World War I, the German army received a reputation for the deadliness and efficiency of its snipers, partly because of the high-quality lenses that German industry could manufacture.\nSoon the British army began to train their own snipers in specialized sniper schools. Major Hesketh Hesketh-Prichard was given formal permission to begin sniper training in 1915, and founded the First Army School of Sniping, Observation, and Scouting at Linghem in France in 1916. Starting with a first class of only six, in time he was able to lecture to large numbers of soldiers from different Allied nations, proudly proclaiming in a letter that his school was turning out snipers at three times the rate of any such other school in the world.\n\nHe also devised a metal-armoured double loophole that would protect the sniper observer from enemy fire. The front loophole was fixed, but the rear was housed in a metal shutter sliding in grooves. Only when the two loopholes were lined up—a one-to-twenty chance—could an enemy shoot between them. Another innovation was the use of a dummy head to find the location of an enemy sniper. The papier-mâché figures were painted to resemble soldiers to draw sniper fire. Some were equipped with rubber surgical tubing so the dummy could \"smoke\" a cigarette and thus appear realistic. Holes punched in the dummy by enemy sniper bullets then could be used for triangulation purposes to determine the position of the enemy sniper, who could then be attacked with artillery fire. He developed many of the modern techniques in sniping, including the use of spotting scopes and working in pairs, and using Kim's Game to train observational skills.\n\nIn 1920, he wrote his account of his war time activities in his book \"\", to which reference is still made by modern authors regarding the subject.\n\nThe main sniper rifles used during the First World War were the German Mauser Gewehr 98; the British Pattern 1914 Enfield and Lee–Enfield SMLE Mk III, the Canadian Ross Rifle, the American M1903 Springfield, and the Russian M1891 Mosin–Nagant.\n\nDuring the interbellum, most nations dropped their specialized sniper units, notably the Germans. Effectiveness and dangers of snipers once again came to the fore during the Spanish Civil War. The only nation that had specially trained sniper units during the 1930s was the Soviet Union. Soviet snipers were trained in their skills as marksmen, in using the terrain to hide themselves from the enemy and the ability to work alongside regular forces. This made the Soviet sniper training focus more on \"normal\" combat situations than those of other nations.\n\nSnipers reappeared as important factors on the battlefield from the first campaign of World War II. During Germany's 1940 campaigns, lone, well-hidden French and British snipers were able to halt the German advance for a considerable amount of time. For example, during the pursuit to Dunkirk, British snipers were able to significantly delay the German infantry's advance. This prompted the British once again to increase training of specialized sniper units. Apart from marksmanship, British snipers were trained to blend in with the environment, often by using special camouflage clothing for concealment. However, because the British Army offered sniper training exclusively to officers and non-commissioned officers, the resulting small number of trained snipers in combat units considerably reduced their overall effectiveness.\n\nDuring the Winter War, Finnish snipers took a heavy toll of the invading Soviet army. Simo Häyhä is credited with 505 confirmed kills, most with the Finnish version of the iron-sighted bolt-action Mosin–Nagant.\n\nOne of the best known battles involving snipers, and the battle that made the Germans reinstate their specialized sniper training, was the Battle of Stalingrad. Their defensive position inside a city filled with rubble meant that Soviet snipers were able to inflict significant casualties on the Wehrmacht troops. Because of the nature of fighting in city rubble, snipers were very hard to spot and seriously dented the morale of the German attackers. The best known of these snipers was probably Vasily Zaytsev, featured in the novel \"War of the Rats\" and the subsequent film \"Enemy At The Gates\".\nGerman \"Scharfschützen\" were prepared before the war, equipped with Karabiner 98 and later Gewehr 43 rifles, but there were often not enough of these weapons available, and as such some were armed with captured scoped Mosin–Nagant 1891/30, SVT or Czech Mauser rifles. The Wehrmacht re-established its sniper training in 1942, drastically increasing the number of snipers per unit with the creation of an additional 31 sniper training companies by 1944. German snipers were at the time the only snipers in the world issued with purpose-manufactured sniping ammunition, known as the 'effect-firing' sS round. The 'effect-firing' sS round featured an extra carefully measured propellant charge and seated a heavy 12.8 gram (198 gr) full-metal-jacketed boat-tail projectile of match-grade build quality, lacking usual features such as a seating ring to improve the already high ballistic coefficient of .584 (G1) further. For aiming optics German snipers used the Zeiss Zielvier 4x (ZF39) telescopic sight which had bullet drop compensation in 50 m increments for ranges from 100 m up to 800 m or in some variations from 100 m up to 1000 m or 1200 m. There were ZF42, Zielfernrohr 43 (ZF 4), Zeiss Zielsechs 6x, Zeiss Zielacht 8x and other telescopic sights by various manufacturers like the Ajack 4x, Hensoldt Dialytan 4x and Kahles Heliavier 4x with similar features employed on German sniper rifles. Several different mountings produced by various manufacturers were used for mounting aiming optics to the rifles. In February 1945 the Zielgerät 1229 active infrared aiming device was issued for night sniping with the StG 44 assault rifle.\n\nA total of 428,335 individuals received Red Army sniper training, including Soviet and non-Soviet partisans, with 9,534 receiving the sniping 'higher qualification'. During World War ІІ, two six-month training courses for women alone trained nearly 55,000 snipers, of which more than two thousand later served in the army. On average there was at least one sniper in an infantry platoon and one in every reconnaissance platoon, including in tank and even artillery units. Some used the PTRD anti-tank rifle with an adapted scope as an early example of an anti-materiel rifle.\n\nIn the United States Armed Forces, sniper training was only very elementary and was mainly concerned with being able to hit targets over long distances. Snipers were required to be able to hit a body over 400 meters away, and a head over 200 meters away. There was almost no instruction in blending into the environment. Sniper training varied from place to place, resulting in wide variation in the qualities of snipers. The main reason the US did not extend sniper training beyond long-range shooting was the limited deployment of US soldiers until the Normandy Invasion. During the campaigns in North Africa and Italy, most fighting occurred in arid and mountainous regions where the potential for concealment was limited, in contrast to Western and Central Europe.\n\nThe U.S. Army's lack of familiarity with sniping tactics proved disastrous in Normandy and the campaign in Western Europe where they encountered well trained German snipers. In Normandy, German snipers remained hidden in the dense vegetation and were able to encircle American units, firing at them from all sides. The American and British forces were surprised by how near the German snipers could approach in safety and attack them, as well as by their ability to hit targets at up to 1,000m. A notable mistake made by inexperienced American soldiers was to lie down and wait when targeted by German snipers, allowing the snipers to pick them off one after another. German snipers often infiltrated Allied lines and sometimes when the front-lines moved, they continued to fight from their sniping positions, refusing to surrender until their rations and munitions were exhausted.\n\nThose tactics were also a consequence of changes in German enlistment. After several years of war and heavy losses on the Eastern Front, the German army was forced to rely more heavily on enlisting teenage soldiers. Due to lack of training in more complex group tactics, and thanks to rifle training provided by the Hitlerjugend, those soldiers were often used as autonomous left-behind snipers. While an experienced sniper would take a few lethal shots and retreat to a safer position, those young boys, due both to a disregard for their own safety and to lack of tactical experience would frequently remain in a concealed position and fight until they ran out of ammunition or were killed or wounded. While this tactic generally ended in the demise of the sniper, giving rise to the nickname \"Suicide Boys\" that was given to those soldiers, this irrational behavior proved quite disruptive to the Allied forces' progress. After World War II, many elements of German sniper training and doctrine were copied by other countries.\nIn the Pacific War, the Empire of Japan trained snipers. In the jungles of Asia and the Pacific Islands, snipers posed a serious threat to U.S., British, and Commonwealth troops. Japanese snipers were specially trained to use the environment to conceal themselves. Japanese snipers used foliage on their uniforms and dug well-concealed hide-outs that were often connected with small trenches. There was no need for long range accuracy because most combat in the jungle took place within a few hundred meters. Japanese snipers were known for their patience and ability to remain hidden for long periods. They almost never left their carefully camouflaged hiding spots. This meant that whenever a sniper was in the area, the location of the sniper could be determined after the sniper had fired a few shots. The Allies used their own snipers in the Pacific, notably the U.S. Marines, who used M1903 Springfield rifles.\n\nCommon sniper rifles used during the Second World War include: the Soviet M1891/30 Mosin–Nagant and, to a lesser extent, the SVT-40; the German Mauser Karabiner 98k and Gewehr 43; the British Lee–Enfield No. 4 and Pattern 1914 Enfield; the Japanese Arisaka 97; the American M1903A4 Springfield and M1C Garand. The Italians trained few snipers and supplied them with a scoped Carcano Model 1891.\n\nMilitary sniper training aims to teach a high degree of proficiency in camouflage and concealment, stalking, observation and map reading as well as precision marksmanship under various operational conditions. Trainees typically shoot thousands of rounds over a number of weeks, while learning these core skills.\n\nSnipers are trained to squeeze the trigger straight back with the ball of their finger, to avoid jerking the gun sideways. The most accurate position is prone, with a sandbag supporting the stock, and the stock's cheek-piece against the cheek. In the field, a bipod can be used instead. Sometimes a sling is wrapped around the weak arm (or both) to reduce stock movement. Some doctrines train a sniper to breathe deeply before shooting, then hold their lungs empty while they line up and take their shot. Some go further, teaching their snipers to shoot between heartbeats to minimize barrel motion.\n\nThe key to sniping is accuracy, which applies to both the weapon and the shooter. The weapon should be able to consistently place shots within tight tolerances. The sniper in turn must utilize the weapon to accurately place shots under varying conditions.\n\nA sniper must have the ability to accurately estimate the various factors that influence a bullet's trajectory and point of impact such as: range to the target, wind direction, wind velocity, altitude and elevation of the sniper and the target and ambient temperature. Mistakes in estimation compound over distance and can decrease lethality or cause a shot to miss completely.\n\nSnipers zero their weapons at a target range or in the field. This is the process of adjusting the scope so that the bullet's points-of-impact is at the point-of-aim (centre of scope or scope's cross-hairs) for a specific distance. A rifle and scope should retain its zero as long as possible under all conditions to reduce the need to re-zero during missions.\n\nA sandbag can serve as a useful platform for shooting a sniper rifle, although any soft surface such as a rucksack will steady a rifle and contribute to consistency. In particular, bipods help when firing from a prone position, and enable the firing position to be sustained for an extended period of time. Many police and military sniper rifles come equipped with an adjustable bipod. Makeshift bipods known as shooting sticks can be constructed from items such as tree branches or ski poles.\n\nRange and accuracy vary depending on the cartridge and specific ammunition types that are used. Typical ranges for common battle field cartridges are as follows:\n\nServicemen volunteer for the rigorous sniper training and are accepted on the basis of their aptitude, physical ability, marksmanship, patience and mental stability. Military snipers may be further trained as forward air controllers (FACs) to direct air strikes or forward observers (FOs) to direct artillery or mortar fire.\n\nFrom 2011, the Russian armed forces has run newly developed sniper courses in military district training centres. In place of the Soviet practice of mainly squad sharpshooters, which were often designated during initial training (and of whom only few become snipers \"per se\"), \"new\" Army snipers are to be trained intensively for 3 months (for conscripts) or longer (for contract soldiers). The training program includes theory and practice of countersniper engagements, artillery spotting and coordination of air support. The first instructors are the graduates of the Solnechnogorsk sniper training centre.\n\nThe method of sniper deployment, according to the Ministry of Defence, is likely to be one three-platoon company at the brigade level, with one of the platoons acting independently and the other two supporting the battalions as needed.\n\nThe range to the target is measured or estimated as precisely as conditions permit and correct range estimation becomes absolutely critical at long ranges, because a bullet travels with a curved trajectory and the sniper must compensate for this by aiming higher at longer distances. If the exact distance is not known the sniper may compensate incorrectly and the bullet path may be too high or low. As an example, for a typical military sniping cartridge such as 7.62×51mm NATO (.308 Winchester) M118 Special Ball round this difference (or “drop”) from is . This means that if the sniper incorrectly estimated the distance as 700 meters when the target was in fact 800 meters away, the bullet will be 200 millimeters lower than expected by the time it reaches the target.\n\nLaser rangefinders may be used, and range estimation is often the job of both parties in a team. One useful method of range finding without a laser rangefinder is comparing the height of the target (or nearby objects) to their size on the mil dot scope, or taking a known distance and using some sort of measure (utility poles, fence posts) to determine the additional distance. The average human head is in width, average human shoulders are apart and the average distance from a person's pelvis to the top of their head is .\n\nTo determine the range to a target without a laser rangefinder, the sniper may use the mil dot reticle on a scope to accurately find the range. Mil dots are used like a slide rule to measure the height of a target, and if the height is known, the range can be as well. The height of the target (in yards) ×1000, divided by the height of the target (in mils), gives the range in yards. This is only in general, however, as both scope magnification (7×, 40×) and mil dot spacing change. The USMC standard is that 1 mil (that is, 1 milliradian) equals 3.438 MOA (minute of arc, or, equivalently, minute of angle), while the US Army standard is 3.6 MOA, chosen so as to give a diameter of 1 yard at a distance of 1,000 yards (or equivalently, a diameter of 1 meter at a range of 1 kilometer.) Many commercial manufacturers use 3.5, splitting the difference, since it is easier to work with.\n\nIt is important to note that angular mil (\"mil\") is only an approximation of a milliradian and different organizations use different approximations.\n\nAt longer ranges, bullet drop plays a significant role in targeting. The effect can be estimated from a chart, which may be memorized or taped to the rifle, although some scopes come with Bullet Drop Compensator (BDC) systems that only require the range be dialed in. These are tuned to both a specific class of rifle and specific ammunition. Every bullet type and load will have different ballistics. .308 Federal 175 grain (11.3 g) BTHP match shoots at . Zeroed at , a 16.2 MOA adjustment would have to be made to hit a target at . If the same bullet was shot with 168 grain (10.9 g), a 17.1 MOA adjustment would be necessary.\n\nShooting uphill or downhill is confusing for many because gravity does not act perpendicular to the direction the bullet is traveling. Thus, gravity must be divided into its component vectors. Only the fraction of gravity equal to the cosine of the angle of fire with respect to the horizon affects the rate of fall of the bullet, with the remainder adding or subtracting negligible velocity to the bullet along its trajectory. To find the correct zero, the sniper multiplies the actual distance to the range by this fraction and aims as if the target were that distance away. For example, a sniper who observes a target 500 meters away at a 45-degree angle downhill would multiply the range by the cosine of 45 degrees, which is 0.707. The resulting distance will be 353 meters. This number is equal to the horizontal distance to the target. All other values, such as windage, time-to-target, impact velocity, and energy will be calculated based on the actual range of 500 meters. Recently, a small device known as a cosine indicator has been developed. This device is clamped to the tubular body of the telescopic sight, and gives an indicative readout in numerical form as the rifle is aimed up or down at the target. This is translated into a figure used to compute the horizontal range to the target.\n\nWindage plays a significant role, with the effect increasing with wind speed or the distance of the shot. The slant of visible convections near the ground can be used to estimate crosswinds, and correct the point of aim. All adjustments for range, wind, and elevation can be performed by aiming off the target, called \"holding over\" or Kentucky windage. Alternatively, the scope can be adjusted so that the point of aim is changed to compensate for these factors, sometimes referred to as \"dialing in\". The shooter must remember to return the scope to zeroed position. Adjusting the scope allows for more accurate shots, because the cross-hairs can be aligned with the target more accurately, but the sniper must know exactly what differences the changes will have on the point-of-impact at each target range.\n\nFor moving targets, the point-of-aim is ahead of the target in the direction of movement. Known as \"leading\" the target, the amount of \"lead\" depends on the speed and angle of the target's movement as well as the distance to the target. For this technique, holding over is the preferred method. Anticipating the behavior of the target is necessary to accurately place the shot.\n\nThe term \"hide site\" refers to a covered and concealed position from which a sniper and his team can conduct surveillance or fire at targets. A good hide conceals and camouflages the sniper effectively, provides cover from enemy fire and allows a wide view of the surrounding area.\n\nThe main purpose of ghillie suits and hide sites is to break up the outline of a person with a rifle.\n\nMany snipers use ghillie suits to hide and stay hidden. Ghillie suits vary according to the terrain into which the sniper wishes to blend. For example, in dry grassland the sniper will typically wear a ghillie suit covered in dead grass.\n\nShot placement, which is where on the body the sniper is aiming, varies with the type of sniper. Military snipers, who generally do not shoot at targets at less than , usually attempt body shots, aiming at the chest. These shots depend on tissue damage, organ trauma, and blood loss to kill the soldier. Body shots are used because the chest is a larger target.\n\nPolice snipers, who generally shoot at much shorter distances, may attempt a more precise shot at particular parts of body or particular devices: in one incident in 2007 in Marseille, a GIPN sniper took a shot from at the pistol of a police officer threatening to commit suicide, destroying the weapon and preventing the police officer from killing himself.\n\nIn a high-risk or hostage-taking situation where a suspect is imminently threatening to kill a hostage, police snipers may take head shots to ensure an instant kill. The snipers aim for the medulla oblongata to sever the spine from the brain. While this is believed to prevent the target from reflexively firing their weapon, there is evidence that any brain hit is sufficient.\n\nSnipers are trained for the detection, identification, and location of a targeted soldier in sufficient detail to permit the effective employment of lethal and non-lethal means. Since most kills in modern warfare are by crew-served weapons, reconnaissance is one of the most effective uses of snipers. They use their aerobic conditioning, infiltration skills and excellent long-distance observation equipment (optical scopes) and tactics to approach and observe the enemy. In this role, their rules of engagement typically let them shoot at high-value targets of opportunity, such as enemy officers.\n\nThe targets may be personnel or high-value materiel (military equipment and weapons) but most often they target the most important enemy personnel such as officers or specialists (e.g. communications operators) so as to cause maximum disruption to enemy operations. Other personnel they might target include those who pose an immediate threat to the sniper, like dog handlers, who are often employed in a search for snipers. A sniper identifies officers by their appearance and behavior such as symbols of rank, talking to radio operators, sitting as a passenger in a car, sitting in a car with a large radio antenna, having military servants, binoculars/map cases or talking and moving position more frequently. If possible, snipers shoot in descending order by rank, or if rank is unavailable, they shoot to disrupt communications.\n\nSome rifles, such as the Denel NTW-20 and Vidhwansak, are designed for a purely anti-materiel (AM) role, e.g. shooting turbine disks of parked aircraft, missile guidance packages, expensive optics, and the bearings, tubes or wave guides of radar sets. A sniper equipped with the correct rifle can target radar dishes, water containers, the engines of vehicles, and any number of other targets. Other rifles, such as the .50 caliber rifles produced by Barrett and McMillan, are not designed exclusively as AM rifles, but are often employed in such a way, providing the range and power needed for AM applications in a lightweight package compared to most traditional AM rifles. Other calibers, such as the .408 Cheyenne Tactical and the .338 Lapua Magnum, are designed to be capable of limited AM application, but are ideally suited as long range anti-personnel rounds.\n\nOften in situations with multiple targets, snipers use relocation. After firing a few shots from a certain position, snipers move unseen to another location before the enemy can determine where they are and mount a counter-attack. Snipers will frequently use this tactic to their advantage, creating an atmosphere of chaos and confusion. In other, rarer situations, relocation is used to eliminate the factor of wind.\n\nAs sniper rifles are often extremely powerful and consequently loud, it is common for snipers to use a technique known as sound masking. When employed by a highly skilled marksman, this tactic can be used as a substitute for a noise suppressor. Very loud sounds in the environment, such as artillery shells air bursting or claps of thunder, can often mask the sound of the shot. This technique is frequently used in clandestine operations, infiltration tactics, and guerrilla warfare.\n\nDue to the surprise nature of sniper fire, high lethality of aimed shots and frustration at the inability to locate and counterattack snipers, sniper tactics have a significant negative effect on morale. Extensive use of sniper tactics can be used to induce constant stress and fear in opposing forces, making them afraid to move about or leave cover. In many ways, the psychological impact imposed by snipers is quite similar to those of landmines, booby-traps, and IEDs (constant threat, high \"per event\" lethality, inability to strike back).\n\nHistorically, captured snipers are often summarily executed. This happened during World War I, and World War II, for example the second Biscari Massacre when 36 suspected snipers were lined up and shot on 14 July 1943.\n\nAs a result, if a sniper is in imminent danger of capture, he may discard any items (sniper rifle, laser rangefinder, etc.) which might indicate his status as a sniper. The risk of captured snipers being summarily executed is explicitly referred to in Chapter 6 of US Army doctrine document FM 3-060.11 entitled \"SNIPER AND COUNTERSNIPER TACTICS, TECHNIQUES, AND PROCEDURES\":\n\nThe negative reputation and perception of snipers can be traced back to the American Revolution, when American \"Marksmen\" intentionally targeted British officers, an act considered uncivilized by the British Army at the time (this reputation was cemented during the Battle of Saratoga, when Benedict Arnold allegedly ordered his marksmen to target British General Simon Fraser, an act that won the battle and French support). The British side used specially selected sharpshooters as well, often German mercenaries.\n\nTo demoralize enemy troops, snipers can follow predictable patterns. During the 26th of July Movement in the Cuban Revolution, the revolutionaries led by Fidel Castro always killed the foremost man in a group of President Batista's soldiers. Realizing this, none of Batista's men would walk first, as it was suicidal. This effectively decreased the army's willingness to search for rebel bases in the mountains. An alternative approach to this psychological process is to kill the second man in the row, leading to the psychological effect of nobody wanting to follow the \"leader\".\n\nThe occurrence of sniper warfare has led to the evolution of many counter-sniper tactics in modern military strategies. These aim to reduce the damage caused by a sniper to an army, which can often be harmful to both combat capabilities and morale.\n\nThe risk of damage to a chain of command can be reduced by removing or concealing features that would otherwise indicate an officer's rank. Modern armies tend to avoid saluting officers in the field, and eliminate rank insignia on battle dress uniforms (BDU). Officers can seek maximum cover before revealing themselves as good candidates for elimination through actions such as reading maps or using radios.\n\nFriendly snipers can be used to hunt the enemy sniper. Besides direct observation, defending forces can use other techniques. These include calculating the trajectory of a bullet by triangulation. Traditionally, triangulation of a sniper's position was done manually, though radar-based technology has recently become available. Once located, the defenders can attempt to approach the sniper from cover and overwhelm them. The United States military is funding a project known as RedOwl (Robot Enhanced Detection Outpost With Lasers), which uses laser and acoustic sensors to determine the exact direction from which a sniper round has been fired.\n\nThe more rounds fired by a sniper, the greater the chance the target has of locating him. Thus, attempts to draw fire are often made, sometimes by offering a helmet slightly out of concealment, a tactic successfully employed in the Winter War by the Finns known as \"Kylmä-Kalle\" (Cold Charlie). They used a shop mannequin or other doll dressed as a tempting target, such as an officer. The doll was then presented as if it were a real man sloppily covering himself. Usually, Soviet snipers were unable to resist the temptation of an apparently easy kill. Once the angle where the bullet came from was determined, a large caliber gun, such as a Lahti L-39 \"Norsupyssy\" (\"Elephant rifle\") anti-tank rifle was fired at the sniper to kill him.\n\nOther tactics include directing artillery or mortar fire onto suspected sniper positions, the use of smoke screens, placing tripwire-operated munitions, mines, or other booby-traps near suspected sniper positions. Even dummy trip-wires can be placed to hamper sniper movement. If anti-personnel mines are unavailable, it is possible to improvise booby-traps by connecting trip-wires to hand grenades, smoke grenades or flares. Though these may not kill a sniper, they will reveal their location. Booby-trap devices can be placed near likely sniper hides, or along the probable routes to and from positions. Knowledge of sniper field-craft will assist in this task.\n\nOne very old counter-sniper tactic is to tie rags onto bushes or similar items in suspected sniper hides. These rags flutter in the breeze creating movements in the corner of the sniper's eye, which they will often find distracting. The greatest virtue of this tactic is its simplicity and ease of implementation; however, it is unlikely to prevent a skilled sniper from selecting targets, and may in fact provide a sniper with additional information about the wind near the target.\n\nThe use of canine units had been very successful, especially during the Vietnam War.\n\nThe use of sniping (in the sense of shooting at relatively long range from a concealed position) to murder came to public attention in a number of sensational U.S. criminal cases, including the Austin sniper incident of 1966 (Charles Whitman), the John F. Kennedy assassination (Lee Harvey Oswald), and the Beltway sniper attacks of late 2002 (Lee Boyd Malvo). However, these incidents usually do not involve the range or skill of military snipers; in all three cases the perpetrators had U.S. military training, but in other specialties. News reports will often (inaccurately) use the term sniper to describe anyone shooting with a rifle at another person.\n\nSniping has been used in asymmetric warfare situations, for example in the Northern Ireland Troubles, where in 1972, the bloodiest year of the conflict, the majority of the soldiers killed were shot by concealed IRA riflemen. There were some instances in the early 1990s of British soldiers and RUC personnel being shot with .50 caliber Barrett rifles by sniper teams collectively known as the South Armagh sniper.\n\nThe sniper is particularly suited to combat environments where one side is at a disadvantage. A careful sniping strategy can use a few individuals and resources to thwart the movement or other progress of a much better equipped or larger force. Sniping enables a few persons to instil terror in a much larger regular force — regardless of the size of the force the snipers are attached to. It is widely accepted that sniping, while effective in specific instances, is much more effective as a broadly deployed psychological attack or as a force-multiplier.\n\nSnipers are less likely to be treated mercifully than non-snipers if captured by the enemy. The rationale for this is that ordinary soldiers shoot at each other at 'equal opportunity' whilst snipers take their time in tracking and killing individual targets in a methodical fashion with a relatively low risk of retaliation.\n\nIn 2003, the U.S.-led multinational coalition composed of primarily U.S. and UK troops occupied Iraq and attempted to establish a new government in the country. However, shortly after the initial invasion, violence against coalition forces and among various sectarian groups led to asymmetric warfare with the Iraqi insurgency and civil war between many Sunni and Shia Iraqis.\n\nThrough November 2005, when the Pentagon had last reported a sniper fatality, the Army had attributed 28 of 2,100 U.S. deaths to enemy snipers. More recently, since 2006, insurgent snipers such as \"Juba\" have caused problems for American troops. Claims have been made that Juba have shot up to 37 American soldiers in Iraq as of October 2006.\n\nIn 2006, training materials obtained by U.S. intelligence showed that snipers fighting in Iraq were urged to single out and attack engineers, medics, and chaplains on the theory that those casualties would demoralize entire enemy units. Among the training materials, there included an insurgent sniper training manual that was posted on the Internet. Among its tips for shooting U.S. troops, there read: \"Killing doctors and chaplains is suggested as a means of psychological warfare.\"\n\nSome sniper teams in Afghanistan have killed large numbers of Taliban in quite short periods of time. For example, while in Helmand Province, two British snipers (part of the Welsh Guards Battle group) shot dead a total of 75 Taliban in only 40 days during the summer of 2009. In one session of duty, lasting just two hours, they shot and killed eight Taliban. On another occasion, the same team scored a \"Quigley\" (i.e., killing two Taliban with a single bullet) at a range of 196 metres.\n\nTaliban snipers have themselves caused problems for coalition forces. For example, over a four-month period in early 2011, two Taliban snipers shot dead two British soldiers and wounded six others at an outpost in Qadrat, Helmand province. In one unusual incident, an unnamed 55-year-old ex-Mujahideen fighter with a motorbike and an old British-made Enfield rifle killed two British soldiers with a single shot, hitting the first in the head and the second in the neck.\n\nSniper activity has been reported during the Arab Spring civil unrest in Libya in 2011, both from anti-governmental and pro-governmental supporters, and in Syria at least from pro-government forces.\n\nEven before firearms were available, soldiers such as archers were specially trained as elite marksmen.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n</small>\n"}

It was founded by Ralph C. Smedley on October 22, 1924, at the YMCA in Santa Ana, California, United States. It originated as a set of classes with the aim of improving the communication skills of the young men under his charge. Toastmasters International was incorporated under Californian law on December 19, 1932.\n\nThe first international chapter was established in Vancouver, Canada in 1932. The organization began admitting women in 1973.\n\nThroughout its history, Toastmasters has served over four million people, and today the organization serves over 352,000 members in 141 countries, through its 16,400 member clubs. Toastmasters membership increased rapidly around the turn of the century, nearing 16,000 clubs worldwide by 2016.\n\nToastmasters International uses a local club-based structure, each having around 20-40 members. Meetings are held every week or other week and usually in the evening, although some clubs meet in the morning or afternoon. Each club operates as a separate entity with a set of requirements leading to chartered status for them to be recognised as official Toastmasters clubs. Chartered status allows for clubs to use the names, promotional material and programme of TI.\n\nPart of meetings is devoted to Table Topics, which are off-the-cuff speeches which are assigned on the spot by a Topicsmaster. The goal of this is to think on one's feet with minimal preparation. In some clubs attendees are then asked to vote on who they thought gave the best speech.\n\nEvery meeting is based around a set of organised speeches. Speakers are evaluated by an experienced member who then gives an impromptu speech with constructive feedback based on their performance.\n\nToastmasters International places a large emphasis on building the public speaking and leadership skills of its members. The current education system consists of ten differing paths suited to their needs and requirements, based around \"Public Speaking\", \"Interpersonal Communication\", \"Management\", \"Strategic Leadership\", and \"Confidence\". Each path consists of 14 projects. Content consists of online and print materials, it being the first time in the organisation’s history to provide modern technology in its programme. Content is available in English, French and German.\n\nToastmasters runs an international public speaking championship formally known as the Toastmasters International World Champion of Public Speaking, which is held annually at its International Convention in August. It started in 1938 and involves over 33,000 participants in 141 countries making it the world's largest speech contest. There is a six-month process of elimination to reach the semifinals, in which in 2018 there were 106 participants who got that far. There are ten places in the final and speeches are judged on content, gestures, organisation and style.\n\n"}

The name first appears in the tenth century, when a bishopric of the \"\"Vardariotai\" or \"Tourkoi\"\" is mentioned as subject to the diocese of Thessalonica. The mid-fourteenth century writer Pseudo-Kodinos calls them \"Persians\" by race (a typical Byzantine anachronism for \"Turks\"), and recalls that they were settled in the Vardar river valley by an unnamed Byzantine emperor of old. In both cases, however, \"Turks\" probably implies the Magyars, who were called \"Tourkoi\" by the Byzantines in the tenth–eleventh centuries. Hence it seems that the \"Vardariotai\" were Magyars resettled in Macedonia in the tenth century, and that they had become Christians by the end of that century.\n\nBy the twelfth century, the \"Vardariotai\", their Magyar identity by now much diluted, were being recruited into the Byzantine army, and, at the latest during the latter part of the reign of Emperor Manuel I Komnenos (r. 1143–1180), they were formed into a distinct palace guard regiment. Their functions, however, at least in the Palaiologan period, appear to have been more those of a police force than a military unit: Pseudo-Kodinos lists them not with the guards, but with the unarmed palace personnel, and states that their duty was \"to keep people orderly\" during ceremonies. Unlike the armed members of the Varangian Guard and the \"Paramonai\" regiment, they were equipped only with a whip (the \"manglabion\") and a staff (the \"dekanikion\"). Kodinos also records that they wore distinctive red uniforms and a \"Persian\" hat called \"angouroton\" (\"cucumber-shaped\"), and that the whip, hanging at their belt, was their symbol. This latter reference has led to the hypothesis that the \"Vardariotai\" were the replacement of the older \"Manglabites\" guards corps. They were commanded by a \"primikerios\", first attested in the year 1166. The thirteenth-century historian George Akropolites further states that the \"Vardariotai\" accompanied the Byzantine emperor to his military camp whilst on campaign.\n\nIt is unclear whether and how the \"vardarioi\", administrative officials of Thessalonica in the tenth–eleventh centuries, known through their seals, are related to the \"Vardariotai\".\n\n\n"}
