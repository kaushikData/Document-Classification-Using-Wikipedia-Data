{"id": "44324", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=44324", "title": "Commodus", "text": "Commodus\n\nCommodus (; 31 August 161 – 31 December 192 CE), born Lucius Aurelius Commodus and died Lucius Aelius Aurelius Commodus, was Roman emperor with his father Marcus Aurelius from 177 to his father's death in 180, and solely until 192.\n\nDuring his father's reign, he accompanied Marcus Aurelius during the Marcomannic Wars in 172 and on a tour of the Eastern provinces in 176. He was made the youngest consul in Roman history in 177 and later that year elevated to co-emperor with his father. His accession was the first time a son had succeeded his biological father since Titus succeeded Vespasian in 79. He was also the first emperor to have both a father and grandfather (who had adopted his father) as the two preceding emperors. Commodus was the first (and until 337, the only) emperor \"born in the purple\", i.e. during his father's reign.\n\nDuring his solo reign, the Empire enjoyed a period of reduced military conflict compared with the reign of Marcus Aurelius, but intrigues and conspiracies abounded, leading Commodus to an increasingly dictatorial style of leadership that culminated in a God-like personality cult. His assassination in 192 marked the end of the Nerva–Antonine dynasty. He was succeeded by Pertinax, the first emperor in the tumultuous Year of the Five Emperors.\n\nCommodus was born on 31 August 161 in Lanuvium, near Rome. He was the son of the reigning emperor, Marcus Aurelius, and Aurelius's first cousin, Faustina the Younger, the youngest daughter of Emperor Antoninus Pius, who had died only a few months before. Commodus had an elder twin brother, Titus Aurelius Fulvus Antoninus, who died in 165. On 12 October 166, Commodus was made Caesar together with his younger brother, Marcus Annius Verus. The latter died in 169 having failed to recover from an operation, which left Commodus as Marcus Aurelius's sole surviving son.\nHe was looked after by his father's physician, Galen, who treated many of Commodus' common illnesses. Commodus received extensive tutoring by a multitude of teachers with a focus on intellectual education. Among his teachers, Onesicrates, Antistius Capella, Titus Aius Sanctus, and Pitholaus are mentioned.\n\nCommodus is known to have been at Carnuntum, the headquarters of Marcus Aurelius during the Marcomannic Wars, in 172. It was presumably there that, on 15 October 172, he was given the victory title \"Germanicus\", in the presence of the army. The title suggests that Commodus was present at his father's victory over the Marcomanni. On 20 January 175, Commodus entered the College of Pontiffs, the starting point of a career in public life.\n\nIn April 175, Avidius Cassius, Governor of Syria, declared himself Emperor following rumours that Marcus Aurelius had died. Having been accepted as Emperor by Syria, Judea and Egypt, Cassius carried on his rebellion even after it had become obvious that Marcus was still alive. During the preparations for the campaign against Cassius, Commodus assumed his toga virilis on the Danubian front on 7 July 175, thus formally entering adulthood. Cassius, however, was killed by one of his centurions before the campaign against him could begin.\n\nCommodus subsequently accompanied his father on a lengthy trip to the Eastern provinces, during which he visited Antioch. The Emperor and his son then traveled to Athens, where they were initiated into the Eleusinian mysteries. They then returned to Rome in the autumn of 176.\n\nMarcus Aurelius was the first emperor since Vespasian to have a legitimate biological son and, though he himself was the fifth in the line of the so-called Five Good Emperors, each of whom had adopted his successor, it seems to have been his firm intention that Commodus should be his heir. On 27 November 176, Marcus Aurelius granted Commodus the rank of \"Imperator\" and, in the middle of 177, the title \"Augustus\", giving his son the same status as his own and formally sharing power.\n\nOn 23 December of the same year, the two Augusti celebrated a joint triumph, and Commodus was given tribunician power. On 1 January 177, Commodus became consul for the first time, which made him, aged 15, the youngest consul in Roman history up to that time. He subsequently married Bruttia Crispina before accompanying his father to the Danubian front once more in 178, where Marcus Aurelius died on 17 March 180, leaving the 18-year-old Commodus sole emperor.\n\nUpon his ascension, Commodus devalued the Roman currency. He reduced the weight of the denarius from 96 per Roman pound to 105 per Roman pound (3.85 grams to 3.35 grams). He also reduced the silver purity from 79 percent to 76 percent – the silver weight dropping from 2.57 grams to 2.34 grams. In 186 he further reduced the purity and silver weight to 74 percent and 2.22 grams respectively, being 108 to the Roman pound. His reduction of the denarius during his rule was the largest since the empire's first devaluation during Nero's reign.\n\nWhereas the reign of Marcus Aurelius had been marked by almost continuous warfare, that of Commodus was comparatively peaceful in the military sense but was marked by political strife and the increasingly arbitrary and capricious behaviour of the emperor himself. In the view of Dio Cassius, a contemporary observer of the period, his accession marked the descent \"from a kingdom of gold to one of iron and rust\".\n\nDespite his notoriety, and considering the importance of his reign, Commodus' years in power are not well chronicled. The principal surviving literary sources are Herodian, Dio Cassius (a contemporary and sometimes first-hand observer, but for this reign, only transmitted in fragments and abbreviations), and the \"Historia Augusta\" (untrustworthy for its character as a work of literature rather than history, with elements of fiction embedded within its biographies; in the case of Commodus, it may well be embroidering upon what the author found in reasonably good contemporary sources).\nCommodus remained with the Danube armies for only a short time before negotiating a peace treaty with the Danubian tribes. He then returned to Rome and celebrated a triumph for the conclusion of the wars on 22 October 180. Unlike the preceding Emperors Trajan, Hadrian, Antoninus Pius and Marcus Aurelius, he seems to have had little interest in the business of administration and tended throughout his reign to leave the practical running of the state to a succession of favourites, beginning with Saoterus, a freedman from Nicomedia who had become his chamberlain.\n\nDissatisfaction with this state of affairs would lead to a series of conspiracies and attempted coups, which in turn eventually provoked Commodus to take charge of affairs, which he did in an increasingly dictatorial manner. Nevertheless, though the senatorial order came to hate and fear him, the evidence suggests that he remained popular with the army and the common people for much of his reign, not least because of his lavish shows of largesse (recorded on his coinage) and because he staged and took part in spectacular gladiatorial combats.\n\nOne of the ways he paid for his donatives (imperial handouts) and mass entertainments was to tax the senatorial order, and on many inscriptions, the traditional order of the two nominal powers of the state, the Senate and People (\"Senatus Populusque Romanus\") is provocatively reversed (\"Populus Senatusque...\").\n\nAt the outset of his reign, Commodus, aged 18, inherited many of his father's senior advisers, notably Tiberius Claudius Pompeianus (the second husband of Commodus' eldest sister Lucilla), his father-in-law Gaius Bruttius Praesens, Titus Fundanius Vitrasius Pollio, and Aufidius Victorinus, who was Prefect of the City of Rome. He also had four surviving sisters, all of them with husbands who were potential rivals. Lucilla was over ten years his senior and held the rank of Augusta as the widow of her first husband, Lucius Verus.\n\nThe first crisis of the reign came in 182, when Lucilla engineered a conspiracy against her brother. Her motive is alleged to have been envy of the Empress Crispina. Her husband, Pompeianus, was not involved, but two men alleged to have been her lovers, Marcus Ummidius Quadratus Annianus (the consul of 167, who was also her first cousin) and Appius Claudius Quintianus, attempted to murder Commodus as he entered a theater. They bungled the job and were seized by the emperor's bodyguard.\n\nQuadratus and Quintianus were executed. Lucilla was exiled to Capri and later killed. Pompeianus retired from public life. One of the two praetorian prefects, Tarrutenius Paternus, had actually been involved in the conspiracy but his involvement was not discovered until later on, and in the aftermath, he and his colleague, Sextus Tigidius Perennis, were able to arrange for the murder of Saoterus, the hated chamberlain.\n\nCommodus took the loss of Saoterus badly, and Perennis now seized the chance to advance himself by implicating Paternus in a second conspiracy, one apparently led by Publius Salvius Julianus, who was the son of the jurist Salvius Julianus and was betrothed to Paternus' daughter. Salvius and Paternus were executed along with a number of other prominent consulars and senators. Didius Julianus, the future emperor and a relative of Salvius Julianus, was dismissed from the governorship of Germania Inferior.\n\nPerennis took over the reins of government and Commodus found a new chamberlain and favourite in Cleander, a Phrygian freedman who had married one of the emperor's mistresses, Demostratia. Cleander was in fact the person who had murdered Saoterus. After those attempts on his life, Commodus spent much of his time outside Rome, mostly on the family estates at Lanuvium. Being physically strong, his chief interest was in sport: taking part in horse racing, chariot racing, and combats with beasts and men, mostly in private but also on occasion in public.\n\nCommodus was inaugurated in 183 as consul with Aufidius Victorinus for a colleague and assumed the title \"Pius\". War broke out in Dacia: few details are available, but it appears two future contenders for the throne, Clodius Albinus and Pescennius Niger, both distinguished themselves in the campaign. Also, in Britain in 184, the governor Ulpius Marcellus re-advanced the Roman frontier northward to the Antonine Wall, but the legionaries revolted against his harsh discipline and acclaimed another legate, Priscus, as emperor.\n\nPriscus refused to accept their acclamations, and Perennis had all the legionary legates in Britain cashiered. On 15 October 184 at the Capitoline Games, a Cynic philosopher publicly denounced Perennis before Commodus. His tale wasn't believed and he was immediately put to death. According to Dio Cassius, Perennis, though ruthless and ambitious, was not personally corrupt and generally administered the state well.\n\nHowever, the following year, a detachment of soldiers from Britain (they had been drafted to Italy to suppress brigands) also denounced Perennis to the emperor as plotting to make his own son emperor (they had been enabled to do so by Cleander, who was seeking to dispose of his rival), and Commodus gave them permission to execute him as well as his wife and sons. The fall of Perennis brought a new spate of executions: Aufidius Victorinus committed suicide. Ulpius Marcellus was replaced as governor of Britain by Pertinax; brought to Rome and tried for treason, Marcellus narrowly escaped death.\n\nCleander proceeded to concentrate power in his own hands and to enrich himself by becoming responsible for all public offices: he sold and bestowed entry to the Senate, army commands, governorships and, increasingly, even the suffect consulships to the highest bidder. Unrest around the empire increased, with large numbers of army deserters causing trouble in Gaul and Germany. Pescennius Niger mopped up the deserters in Gaul in a military campaign, and a revolt in Brittany was put down by two legions brought over from Britain.\n\nIn 187, one of the leaders of the deserters, Maternus, came from Gaul intending to assassinate Commodus at the Festival of the Great Goddess in March, but he was betrayed and executed. In the same year, Pertinax unmasked a conspiracy by two enemies of Cleander – Antistius Burrus (one of Commodus' brothers-in-law) and Arrius Antoninus. As a result, Commodus appeared even more rarely in public, preferring to live on his estates.\n\nEarly in 188, Cleander disposed of the current praetorian prefect, Atilius Aebutianus, and himself took over supreme command of the Praetorians at the new rank of \"a pugione\" (\"dagger-bearer\") with two praetorian prefects subordinate to him. Now at the zenith of his power, Cleander continued to sell public offices as his private business. The climax came in the year 190, which had 25 suffect consuls – a record in the 1,000-year history of the Roman consulship—all appointed by Cleander (they included the future Emperor Septimius Severus).\n\nIn the spring of 190, Rome was afflicted by a food shortage, for which the \"praefectus annonae\" Papirius Dionysius, the official actually in charge of the grain supply, contrived to lay the blame on Cleander. At the end of June, a mob demonstrated against Cleander during a horse race in the Circus Maximus: he sent the praetorian guard to put down the disturbances, but Pertinax, who was now City Prefect of Rome, dispatched the \"Vigiles Urbani\" to oppose them. Cleander fled to Commodus, who was at Laurentum in the house of the Quinctilii, for protection, but the mob followed him calling for his head.\n\nAt the urging of his mistress Marcia, Commodus had Cleander beheaded and his son killed. Other victims at this time were the praetorian prefect Julius Julianus, Commodus' cousin Annia Fundania Faustina, and his brother-in-law Mamertinus. Papirius Dionysius was executed, too.\n\nThe emperor now changed his name to Lucius Aelius Aurelius Commodus. At 29, he took over more of the reins of power, though he continued to rule through a cabal consisting of Marcia, his new chamberlain Eclectus, and the new praetorian prefect Quintus Aemilius Laetus.\n\nIn opposition to the Senate, in his pronouncements and iconography, Commodus had always stressed his unique status as a source of god-like power, liberality, and physical prowess. Innumerable statues around the empire were set up portraying him in the guise of Hercules, reinforcing the image of him as a demigod, a physical giant, a protector, and a battler against beasts and men (see \"Commodus and Hercules\" and \"Commodus the Gladiator\" below). Moreover, as Hercules, he could claim to be the son of Jupiter, the supreme god of the Roman pantheon. These tendencies now increased to megalomaniacal proportions. Far from celebrating his descent from Marcus Aurelius, the actual source of his power, he stressed his own personal uniqueness as the bringer of a new order, seeking to re-cast the empire in his own image.\n\nDuring 191, the city of Rome was extensively damaged by a fire that raged for several days, during which many public buildings including the Temple of Pax, the Temple of Vesta, and parts of the imperial palace were destroyed.\n\nPerhaps seeing this as an opportunity, early in 192 Commodus, declaring himself the new Romulus, ritually re-founded Rome, renaming the city \"Colonia Lucia Annia Commodiana\". All the months of the year were renamed to correspond exactly with his (now twelve) names: \"Lucius\", \"Aelius\", \"Aurelius\", \"Commodus\", \"Augustus\", \"Herculeus\", \"Romanus\", \"Exsuperatorius\", \"Amazonius\", \"Invictus\", \"Felix\", and \"Pius\". The legions were renamed \"Commodianae\", the fleet which imported grain from Africa was termed \"Alexandria Commodiana Togata\", the Senate was entitled the Commodian Fortunate Senate, his palace and the Roman people themselves were all given the name \"Commodianus\", and the day on which these reforms were decreed was to be called \"Dies Commodianus\".\n\nThus, he presented himself as the fountainhead of the Empire, Roman life, and religion. He also had the head of the Colossus of Nero adjacent to the Colosseum replaced with his own portrait, gave it a club, and placed a bronze lion at its feet to make it look like \"Hercules Romanus\", and added an inscription boasting of being \"the only left-handed fighter to conquer twelve times one thousand men\".\n\nIn November 192, Commodus held Plebeian Games, in which he shot hundreds of animals with arrows and javelins every morning, and fought as a gladiator every afternoon, winning all the fights. Also, in December, he announced his intention to inaugurate the year 193 as both consul and gladiator on 1 January.\n\nAt this point, the prefect Laetus formed a conspiracy with Eclectus to supplant Commodus with Pertinax, taking Marcia into their confidence. On 31 December, Marcia poisoned Commodus' food but he vomited up the poison, so the conspirators sent his wrestling partner Narcissus to strangle him in his bath. Upon his death, the Senate declared him a public enemy (a \"de facto\" \"damnatio memoriae\") and restored the original name of the city of Rome and its institutions. Statues of Commodus were demolished. His body was buried in the Mausoleum of Hadrian.\n\nCommodus' death marked the end of the Nerva–Antonine dynasty.\nCommodus was succeeded by Pertinax, whose reign was short lived, being the first to fall victim to the Year of the Five Emperors.\n\nIn 195, the emperor Septimius Severus, trying to gain favour with the family of Marcus Aurelius, rehabilitated Commodus' memory and had the Senate deify him.\n\nCassius Dio, a first-hand witness, describes him as \"not naturally wicked but, on the contrary, as guileless as any man that ever lived. His great simplicity, however, together with his cowardice, made him the slave of his companions, and it was through them that he at first, out of ignorance, missed the better life and then was led on into lustful and cruel habits, which soon became second nature.\"\n\nHis recorded actions do tend to show a rejection of his father's policies, his father's advisers, and especially his father's austere lifestyle, and an alienation from the surviving members of his family. It seems likely that he was brought up in an atmosphere of Stoic asceticism, which he rejected entirely upon his accession to sole rule.\n\nAfter repeated attempts on Commodus' life, Roman citizens were often killed for making him angry. One such notable event was the attempted extermination of the house of the Quinctilii. Condianus and Maximus were executed on the pretext that, while they were not implicated in any plots, their wealth and talent would make them unhappy with the current state of affairs.\n\nOn his accession as sole ruler, Commodus added the name Antoninus to his official nomenclature, presumably to honor his grandfather, Antoninus Pius. In October 180 he changed his \"praenomen\" from Lucius to Marcus, presumably in honour of his father. He later took the title of \"Felix\" in 185. In 191 he restored his \"praenomen\" to Lucius and added the family name Aelius, apparently linking himself to Hadrian and Hadrian's adopted son Lucius Aelius Caesar, whose original name was also Commodus.\n\nLater that year he dropped Antoninus and adopted as his full style Lucius Aelius Aurelius Commodus Augustus Herculeus Romanus Exsuperatorius Amazonius Invictus Felix Pius (the order of some of these titles varies in the sources). \"Exsuperatorius\" (the supreme) was a title given to Jupiter, and \"Amazonius\" identified him again with Hercules.\n\nAn inscribed altar from Dura-Europos on the Euphrates shows that Commodus' titles and the renaming of the months were disseminated to the furthest reaches of the Empire; moreover, that even auxiliary military units received the title Commodiana, and that Commodus claimed two additional titles: \"Pacator Orbis\" (pacifier of the world) and \"Dominus Noster\" (Our Lord). The latter eventually would be used as a conventional title by Roman emperors, starting about a century later, but Commodus seems to have been the first to assume it.\n\nDisdaining the more philosophic inclinations of his father, Commodus was extremely proud of his physical prowess. The historian Herodian, a contemporary, described Commodus as an extremely handsome man. As mentioned above, he ordered many statues to be made showing him dressed as Hercules with a lion's hide and a club. He thought of himself as the reincarnation of Hercules, frequently emulating the legendary hero's feats by appearing in the arena to fight a variety of wild animals. He was left-handed and very proud of the fact. Cassius Dio and the writers of the \"Augustan History\" say that Commodus was a skilled archer, who could shoot the heads off ostriches in full gallop, and kill a panther as it attacked a victim in the arena.\n\nCommodus also had a passion for gladiatorial combat, which he took so far as to take to the arena himself, dressed as a secutor. The Romans found Commodus' gladiatorial combats to be scandalous and disgraceful. It was rumoured that he was actually the son, not of Marcus Aurelius, but of a gladiator whom his mother Faustina had taken as a lover at the coastal resort of Caieta.\n\nIn the arena, Commodus always won, since his opponents always submitted to the emperor. Thus, these public fights would not end in death, although wounded soldiers and amputees would be placed in the arena for Commodus to slay with a sword. Citizens of Rome missing their feet through accident or illness were taken to the arena, where they were tethered together for Commodus to club to death while pretending they were giants. Privately, it was his custom to slay his practice opponents. For each appearance in the arena, he charged the city of Rome a million sesterces, straining the Roman economy.\n\nCommodus was also known for fighting exotic animals in the arena, often to the horror of the Roman people. According to Gibbon, Commodus once killed 100 lions in a single day. Later, he decapitated a running ostrich with a specially designed dart and afterwards carried his sword and the bleeding head of the dead bird over to the section where the Senators sat and motioned as though they were next. Dio notes that the targeted senators actually found this more ridiculous than frightening, and chewed on laurel leaves to conceal their laughter. On another occasion, Commodus killed three elephants on the floor of the arena by himself. Finally, Commodus killed a giraffe, which was considered to be a strange and helpless beast.\n\n\n\n\n\n \n"}

When and where he died is unknown; all that can be ascertained is that he died after the year 1215, as he was condemned again in the council of 1215.\n\nSince David's works were banned, most of what is known of him is from the writings of his contemporaries and opponents, chiefly Albert the Great and St. Thomas Aquinas. David's philosophy was that everything could be divided among bodies, minds, and eternal substances. The indivisible substrate or constituent of bodies is matter (\"yle\"); of minds or souls, intellect (\"nous\"); and of eternal substances, God (\"Deus\"). These three, matter, intellect, and God, are actually one and the same. Consequently, all things, material, intellectual, and spiritual, have one and the same essence — God.\n\nLittle is known about the details of his life. It is not certain whether he was born at Dinant in Belgium, or at Dinan in Brittany. He is believed to have lived for some time at the Roman Court under Pope Innocent III. He was a \"magister\", or teacher, most likely at the University of Paris, and he studied the classical works of Aristotle which had been reintroduced to Europe after the Crusades. It seems likely he was especially influenced by Aristotle's \"Physics\" and \"Metaphysics\". It was in Paris that his work, entitled \"Quaternuli\" (Little Notebooks), was condemned by a provincial council in 1210. The Council was headed by Peter of Corbeil, the Bishop of Sens, and ordered the body of Amalric of Chartres to be disinterred and burned, David's writings to be burned, and forbade reading Aristotle's works on natural philosophy. Anyone in the possession of David's writings after Christmas was declared a heretic. This condemnation of both David and Aristotle was repeated in 1215 by a letter of Cardinal Robert Courçon, papal legate. From a work ascribed to Albert the Great, \"Compilatio de Novo Spiritu\", in the Munich Library, we learn further that in consequence of the condemnation, David fled from France, and so escaped punishment. Besides the \"Quaternuli\", another work entitled \"De Tomis, seu Divisionibus\" is mentioned. It is not improbable, however, that this was merely another title for the \"Quaternuli\". The effect of the order issued by the council was to cause all the writing of David to disappear. Thus, his doctrines are derived from the assertions of his contemporaries and opponents, notably Albert the Great and St. Thomas as mentioned above.\n\nFrom these sources we learn that David was a Pantheist. He identified God with the material substratum of all things, \"materia prima\" (prime matter). He reduced all reality to three categories, namely bodies, minds, and eternal substances. The indivisible substrate or constituent of bodies is matter (\"yle\"); of minds, or souls, intellect (\"nous\"); and of eternal substances, God (Deus). These three, matter, intellect, and God, are one and the same. Consequently, all things, material, intellectual, and spiritual, have one and the same essence — God. The phraseology, which must be David's own, as well as the title above mentioned, \"De Tomis\", suggests the influence of Johannes Scotus Eriugena. Eriugena's work must have been widely known and read in the first decades of the thirteenth century, as is evident from many undeniable facts. Whether David was influenced also by Amalric of Chartres is a matter of debate. Albert, who was a contemporary of David, says that David merely renewed the heresy of someone known as Alexander, \"who taught that God and intellect and matter are one substance\". It is impossible to determine whom Albert means by Alexander, \"a disciple of Xenophanes\"; probably the reference is to some Arabian work that went under the name of a Greek philosopher. There were several works of that kind current in the early part of the thirteenth century. Some critics, however, put forward the surmise that David's immediate source was Avicebron's \"Fons Vitæ\", or the work \"De Unitate\", written by Archdeacon Gundisalvi of Segovia, who was well versed in Arabian philosophical literature. Whatever the source, the doctrines were pantheistic, as all authorities concur in describing them.\n\nThe 1913 Catholic Encyclopedia takes a rather dim view of David's philosophy, and considers the harsh response understandable. It says:\n\nHistorians have thought that the reason St. Albert and St. Thomas responded to David at all was not so much out of fear of David's pantheism, but rather to defend Aristotle. David strongly drew on Aristotle's thoughts on prime matter and form, and Albert and Thomas – both of whom respected Aristotle – wanted to show that Aristotle's writings need not imply pantheism. To do this, they had to dispute David, lest the banning of Aristotle's writings spread outside Paris.\n\n"}

The tribe's main centre was the Buraimi Oasis and the village, then town (now city) of Al Ain. They have long had a strong alliance with the Ruling family of Abu Dhabi, the Bani Yas.\n\nThe tribe's traditional area of influence is the Buraimi Oasis, where at the turn of the 20th century, they owned most of the cultivated land and property with the exception of Buraimi village itself. Numbering 4,500, the tribe consists of three subsections: the Daramikah, who populated Hili, Mutared and Qattara; the Jawabir in Al Ain and the Bani Saad who lived in Jimi. Staying in the villages for the summer date season, in winter the community would move throughout the Trucial States. They kept large flocks of sheep and herded camels and traded in charcoal, which they burned. The fertile woodlands of the oasis, irrigated by a highly effective \"falaj\" system supported this wood-burning industry.\n\nThe early history of the Dhawahir seems to suggest they originally came from the south and populated Dhahirah before Buraimi. A later wave of settlers, the Na'im, have long had an uneasy relationship with the Dhawahir and the two tribes were frequently in dispute.\n\nA number of interests jostled for influence over the Dhawahir and Na'im of Buraimi, including the Sultan of Muscat, the Wahhabis (who had made a number of incursions) and Sheikh Sultan bin Saqr of Sharjah, who had established a number of forts in the oasis. Sheikh Tahnun bin Shakhbut Al Nahyan commanded the loyalty of many of the Bedouin families in the area ('You will be aware that Dhahirah belongs to us' he told the British in 1839) and established his primacy there when, in 1824, an agreement was forced on Sharjah in which Sheikh Sultan bin Saqr Al Qasimi recognised Tahnun's claim to Buraimi and then demolished the forts he had built there.\n\nThe Dhawahir and Manasir in Buraimi were close and Sheikh Khalifa bin Shakbut Al Nahyan acceded to an agreement in 1840, in which he took full responsibility for the Bani Yas, Manasir and, for the first time, the Dhawahir. Khalifa enjoyed their support as fighting men as he did most of the tribes of the interior. His popularity with the tribes was also enjoyed by his son, Sheikh Saeed bin Tahnun Al Nahyan, when facing incursions by the Wahhabis. Following one such incident, Saeed moved on Buraimi, capturing his two forts back from the Wahhabis with the help of both the Dhawahir and Awamir. He then pulled together the Bani Qitab, Ghafalah, Awamir and Bani Yas in Khatam and placed the Manasir and Mazari in Dhafrah to block the relieving Wahhabi army under Sa'ad bin Mutlaq. By 1950, Saeed's great tribal association had cleared Burami Oasis of Wahhabi forces. He subsequently accepted a stipend from the Sultan of Muscat for the defence of Buraimi. \n\nThe strong and longstanding alliance between the Bani Yas and the Dhawahir was relatively unusual, with most of the tribes of the interior keen to assert their independence. The Na'im, for instance, enjoyed an often truculent relationship with the Sultan of Muscat.\n\nIt wasn't always smooth sailing, however. Sheikh Zayed bin Khalifah Al Nahyan, known as 'Zayed the Great', was a strong and charismatic leader and increased his hold on Buraimi by buying date groves and water rights, predominantly from the Dhawahir. It soon became obvious that this policy was changing the pattern of ownership throughout the oasis and the Dhawahir rebelled. Determined to press ahead with his scheme, he reconciled with the Na'im and then went to war with the Dhawahir in 1877. After a month-long conflict, Zayed prevailed and took two Dhawahir Sheikhs hostage to guarantee the good behaviour of the tribe. In 1891 he once again marched on the oasis, with the support of Dubai, and a force of 30 horsemen and 300 camel riders quelled the opposition and took the Dhawahir's main settlement 'Ain Dhawahir (now simply known as 'Al Ain'). He built a fort there to underline his dominion over the oasis and established a \"wali\", wisely appointing a member of the Dhawahir as his headman. Ahmad bin Muhammad bin Hilal Al Dhahiri lived in Jimi and was a loyal and effective representative.\n\nThe Dhawahir subsequently worked for their Bani Yas owners in cultivating the groves. As subjects of Abu Dhabi, the Dhawahir paid taxes on the date crop, as well as water fees.\n"}

Two of his partners also became infected with HIV. One of the two had a child from the union with Monge and the child also contracted HIV. (He was also convicted of one count of unlawfully causing bodily harm to the baby by having unprotected sex with her mother.)\n\nMonge contracted HIV from his late wife, who died of AIDS complications in November 1999. She contracted the virus from a blood transfusion in Nicaragua in 1981. He learned he was HIV positive in November 1999, shortly before his wife died.\n\nMonge commenced his first sexual relationship in January 2000, even though a doctor warned him of the risks and told him to reveal his HIV status to potential partners and to use a condom.\n\nMonge explained that he did not inform his sexual partners because he did not have time and because several of the women were too immature to handle the problem. The sentencing judge called the explanations \"pathetic\".\n\nAccording to the evidence presented in court, Monge had the following overlapping unprotected sexual relationships with women:\n\nIn the case of Victim #2, who became pregnant from Monge, he did not tell her he was HIV positive during their relationship and did not tell her after learning she was pregnant. This prevented the mother from taking medication that might have reduced the risk of transmission of the virus to her baby girl during pregnancy. She also practised breastfeeding, perhaps unknowingly passing the virus to the baby girl that way.\n\nAccording to the evidence presented in court, when one victim broke up with him Monge told her \"I gave you a present that no other guy can give you. I gave you AIDS\".\n\nMonge knew he was HIV positive and took precautions to protect his four children, for example wearing latex gloves when he cooked and letting another sibling shower his youngest daughter.\n\nSoon to be released from prison (Frontenac Institution), Monge has met a woman at a church he goes to on Sunday. They plan to be married once Monge is released and to reside in Nicaragua. The Correctional Service of Canada has denied his request for marriage.\n\nOn June 27, 2002, Justice Steve Glithero of the Ontario Superior Court of Justice sentenced Monge to ten years in prison.\n\nThe judge said:\n\n\"This is a man who carried on four sexual affairs of significant length involving frequent sex... He knowingly and repeatedly risked the very lives of four women and a child by his callous actions which persisted over months. He's largely responsible for the ruination of three lives. The effect of his actions is tragic and immense... His actions show a callous and cruel disregard for his own flesh and blood... One must ask why he would date women as prospective wives and mothers, yet knowingly expose them to the risk of infection with the same condition that had resulted in the death of his wife. ...

{"id": "3863233", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=3863233", "title": "Eduard Wirths", "text": "Eduard Wirths\n\nEduard Wirths (4 September 1909 – 20 September 1945) was the Chief SS doctor (SS-Standortarzt) at the Auschwitz concentration camp from September 1942 to January 1945. Thus, Wirths had formal responsibility for everything undertaken by the nearly 20 SS doctors (including Josef Mengele, Horst Schumann and Carl Clauberg) who worked in the medical sections of Auschwitz between 1942–1945.\n\nEduard Wirths was born in Geroldshausen near Würzburg, Bavaria into a Catholic family with democratic Socialist leanings. His father served as a medical corpsman in the First World War and according to Dr. Robert Jay Lifton had emerged from the war \"...in a depressed state with pacifist leanings, which were undoubtedly expressed in his (as one son put it) 'making doctors of us all...'\" Wirth's younger brother, Helmut, became a notable gynecologist (who later went to Auschwitz to visit his brother to participate in cancer experiments but claimed he left after only a few days on his brother Eduard's advice, due to a disagreement and because of his revulsion of the place). According to Lifton \"...Among the boys it was Eduard who came most under the father’s influence in becoming meticulous, obedient, and unusually conscientious and reliable — traits that continued into his adult life. He never smoked or drank and was described as compassionate and \"soft\" in his responses to others...\" The Wirths family was not known to be anti-semitic or sympathetic to radical nationalist politics.\n\nEduard Wirths, however, became an ardent Nazi while studying medicine at the University of Würzburg (1930–35). He joined the Nazi Party and the SA in June 1933 and applied for admission into the SS in 1934. He entered the Waffen SS in 1939, saw action in Norway and the Russian Front and was classified as medically unfit for combat duty in the spring of 1942 after a heart-attack. Wirths then chose to undertake special training for Department leaders in Dachau Concentration Camp and served as chief SS psychiatrist in Neuengamme concentration camp during July 1942. Coincidentally, in 1942 Josef Mengele was also wounded at the Russian Front, pronounced medically unfit for combat, promoted to the rank of SS-Hauptsturmführer before being assigned to Auschwitz.\n\nDr. Wirths was promoted to SS-Hauptsturmführer (captain) and appointed as chief camp physician at Auschwitz in September, 1942. He was appointed on the basis of his reputation as a competent doctor and committed Nazi who would be capable of stopping the typhus epidemics that had increasingly affected SS personnel at Auschwitz.\n\nAt Auschwitz, Wirths was known to be protective of prisoner doctors and other prisoners doing medical work, to have improved conditions on the medical blocks and was remembered favourably by most prisoner doctors and other inmates who had contact with him. At the same time, Wirths in recommending Dr. Josef Mengele for promotion in August 1944, was able to speak of Mengele's \"open, honest, firm … [and] absolutely dependable\" character and \"magnificent\" intellectual and physical talents; of the \"discretion, perseverance, and energy with which he has fulfilled every task … and … shown himself equal to every situation\"; of his \"valuable contribution to anthropological science by making use of the scientific materials available to him\"; of his \"absolute ideological firmness\" and \"faultless conduct [as] an SS officer\" ; and personal qualities as \"free, unrestrained, persuasive, and lively\" discourse that rendered him \"especially dear to his comrades\".\n\nRudolf Höss, the commandant of Auschwitz between 1940 and December 1943 is said to have held Wirths in particularly high regard. He is said to have remarked of Wirths that \"During my 10 years of service in concentration-camp affairs, I have never encountered a better one.\" \n\nIn 1943 Wirths' benevolent and kind concern for the well-being of Auschwitz inmates resulted in him receiving a Christmas card from Langbein, a political prisoner who worked with him, which contained the message “In the past year you have saved here the lives of 93,000 people. We do not have the right to tell you our wishes. But we wish for ourselves that you stay here in the coming year.” It was signed: “One speaking for the prisoners of Auschwitz.” The figure of 93,000 was the difference in mortality rate among prisoners from typhus in the year prior to Wirths' arrival.\n\nWirths was involved in ordering medical experimentation, particularly in gynecological and typhus-related experimental tests. Wirths's primary research concerned pre-cancerous growths of the cervix. Dr. Wirths was also interested in the sterilization of women, by removing their ovaries through surgery or radiation. It is generally acknowledged that he himself never directly participated in such experiments but delegated their conduct to subordinates. The victims of these experiments were Jewish women who had been imprisoned in Block 10 of the main camp in Auschwitz. Dr. E.W.J. Pearce, an Associate Professor of Obstetrics and Gynecology at the Truman Medical Center has made the following observation regarding Wirths' medical experiments: \". . . Wirths, without consent, photographed the cervices of women prisoners, then amputated the pictured cervices, and sent both photographs and specimens for study to Dr. Hinselmann of Berlin. Hinselmann was the physician who developed colposcopy.\n\nImportantly, Wirths also asserted medical control of prisoner selections at the Auschwitz-Birkenau camp, which, prior to spring 1943, had been conducted by the camp commander and his subordinates. Wirths insisted upon taking his own personal turn in performing selections, which he could have deferred to physician subordinates. Witness testimony given at the Trial of Adolf Eichmann provided a useful insight into how the SS approached the issue of how to record the deaths of Auschwitz prisoners (this did not include those who had been immediately selected for gassing- their admission was simply not recorded in the death registers). Those who died while imprisoned at Auschwitz were always recorded as having died from natural causes and never from being executed or murdered.\n\nWirths was promoted to SS-Sturmbannführer (major) in September 1944. Following the evacuation of Auschwitz in January 1945 he was transferred, along with many other former Auschwitz personnel, to the Mittelbau-Dora concentration camp in Thuringia. Wirths would again hold the post of chief camp physician until Mittelbau-Dora's evacuation in April 1945.\n\nWirths was captured by the Allies at the end of the war and held in custody by British forces. Later, on 20 September 1945, knowing that he would surely face trial for numerous war crimes, Wirths committed suicide by hanging.\n\nRobert Jay Lifton has noted that \n. . . Wirths was significantly immersed in Nazi ideology in three crucial spheres: the claim of revitalizing the German race and Volk; the biomedical path to that revitalization via purification of genes and race; and the focus on the Jews as a threat to this renewal, to the immediate and long-term \"health\" of the Germanic race. While Wirths did not absolutize these convictions in the manner of Mengele — they were in him combined with a strong current of medical humanism — his commitment to the Nazi cause was probably no less strong . . . \n\nPerhaps illustrative of Wirths' commitment to medical 'leadership' was his tendency while at Auschwitz to drive about in a car flying a Red Cross flag as well as his enthusiasm for acting as a marriage counselor and personal adviser to other SS personnel. According to Helgard Kramer, Wirths\n. . . first seized on a career as a military doctor and officer in the German elite troops of the SS, because he desperately wanted to become a member of the upper class; eventually to provide his future wife with a \"decent marriage.\" To reach that goal he had to become a 'tough man'. . . \n\n\n"}
{"id": "2398545", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2398545", "title": "Edward Bancroft", "text": "Edward Bancroft\n\nEdward Bartholomew Bancroft ( – September 7, 1821) was a Massachusetts born physician and chemist who became a double-agent, spying for both the United States and Great Britain while serving as secretary to the American Commission in Paris during the American Revolution.\n\nBancroft was born on January 20, 1745 in Westfield, Massachusetts. His father died of an epileptic seizure when Bancroft was two years old, and his mother remarried five years later to David Bull of Connecticut.\n\nThere Bancroft studied under Silas Deane, a schoolmaster who later became an important politician and diplomat, with whom he would work in Paris. At the age of sixteen, Bancroft was apprenticed to a physician in Killingworth, Connecticut, but after a few years ran away. (Bancroft returned and repaid his debt to his former master in 1766.)\n\nOn July 14, 1763, after fleeing his apprenticeship, Bancroft left New England for the sugar-producing slave colonies of Dutch Guiana, where he became a plantation doctor. He soon expanded his practice to multiple plantations and wrote a study of the local environment. Based on observations of experiments already being performed on live eels by Dutch colonists in and around Surinam and Essequibo, Bancroft concluded that American eels and torpedo fish discharged electricity to stun their prey, rather than by imperceptibly swift mechanical action, as had previously been argued. Although he left South America in 1766, he published \"An Essay on the Natural History of Guiana, in South America\" in London 1769, where with the encouragement of Benjamin Franklin, he embarked on a career as a man of letters. Bancroft later wrote extensively about the chemistry of dyes, based in part on his work in Dutch Guiana, contrasting non-European dyeing techniques unfavorably with the learned \"philosophical chemistry\" of natural philosophers like himself.\n\nIn London, Bancroft's \"Natural History of Guiana\" (1769) attracted the attention of Paul Wentworth, New Hampshire's colonial agent in London, who hired Bancroft to survey Wentworth's plantation in Surinam and make recommendations for more efficient operation. Bancroft spent two months there before returning to London. While in Surinam, Bancroft wrote a three-volume, semi-autobiographical novel, \"The History of Charles Wentworth, Esq\". The epistolary novel, which follows the life of a plantation owner (with the same surname as his friend and employer), imitates Voltaire's \"Candide\" and reflects Bancroft's deistic beliefs, ridiculing passages in the Bible and criticizing Christianity for its \"detestable spirit of intolerance and persecution.\"\n\nIn 1771 Edward married the twenty-two year old Penelope Fellows, daughter of a prominent Catholic family. A son, Edward, was born in 1772; they eventually had six more children. Bancroft was elected a fellow of the Royal Society in 1773 as \"a gentleman versed in natural history and Chymistry, and author of the natural history of Guiana\". In the summer of 1773, Bancroft joined the Medical Society of London, though he did not receive his M.D. from the University of Aberdeen until 1774.\n\nWhen the Committee of Secret Correspondence sent Silas Deane (Bancroft's former teacher) to France in 1776; Franklin instructed Deane to contact Bancroft, believing he would be a source of useful information. Deane arrived in France on June 7, 1776; the next day he wrote to Bancroft in London, asking him to come to Paris. In the letter, Deane said they would discuss procuring goods for trading with the Indians, and he enclosed thirty pounds (a generous amount) for travel expenses. Deane did not mention political issues in case the letter was intercepted. Bancroft met with Deane on July 8 and learned that Deane's purpose in France was to win French aid for the Americans against Britain. While Bancroft declined the invitation to attend negotiations, he did serve as Deane's assistant and interpreter. Deane's negotiations resulted in France sending some supplies to the Americans.\n\nDeane told Bancroft that American leaders hoped to embroil Britain in a war against other foes (specifically, an alliance of France and Prussia), which they hoped would distract Britain. Though Deane and other Americans thought France would form an alliance, the ploy came to nothing. Nevertheless, it greatly troubled Bancroft. On July 26, 1776, Bancroft returned to London, assuring Deane that he would spy for the colonies. In London, Bancroft sent copies of recent newspapers and pamphlets on current affairs and long letters to Deane to keep the Americans informed about the thinking of the British government and people. Bancroft arranged to have his dispatches smuggled into France in French diplomatic pouches to avoid having them opened by the London post office. In December 1776 Bancroft was visited by the arsonist, John the Painter, after he had set a fire near the Portsmouth dock. Bancroft refused to give him any assistance.\n\nThough Bancroft had worked for Franklin and Deane, he was unenthusiastic about American independence, and the possibility of a French war against Britain alarmed him. Despite his promise to Deane, he had reservations about doing anything that might promote a rift between Britain and the American colonies.\n\nIn London he met Paul Wentworth, recently recruited by the British Secret Service. Wentworth arranged for Bancroft to meet Secret Service chief William Eden and Lords Suffolk and Weymouth, where Bancroft agreed to become a spy for Britain. A couple of days later, on August 14, 1776, Bancroft composed a nine-page report detailing what Deane had been able to accomplish since arriving in France. In early February 1777, Bancroft visited John the Painter while he was in prison in London.\n\nSoon after this, Franklin arrived to take over the negotiations with France. Bancroft was ordered to associate himself with Franklin. Fortuitously, Franklin appointed Bancroft as secretary to the American Commission in Paris. On March 26, 1777, Bancroft departed London for Paris, where his wife and children joined him two months later. For his spying, the British promised Bancroft a pension of 200 pounds. (This amount was later increased to 500 and then 1,000 pounds.)\n\nBancroft assisted Franklin and Deane by copying letters and other documents, by translating diplomatic correspondence into French or English, and by arranging for repairs, hiring crews, and buying supplies for American ships in French ports. Thus Bancroft had access to much sensitive information that he was able to pass along to the British.\n\nBancroft reported under the cover of weekly letters to \"Mr. Richards\", signed \"Edward Edwards\", about \"gallantry\" (exploits with women). But between the lines of the cover text, Bancroft wrote his reports in a special ink. Every Tuesday after 9:30 PM, he put the letter in a bottle, tied a string around it, and left it in a hole in a certain box tree in Paris. A British official retrieved the message and replaced it with new orders. Bancroft would return later that night to recover the bottle. Through this method, George III may have seen the French-American Treaty of Alliance just two days after it was signed. Bancroft was \"successful but ineffective\"; that is, though he gathered a good deal of information, the British were unable to prevent a Franco-American alliance.\n\nIn December 1777, John Paul Jones arrived in France, expecting to be given command of the ship \"Indien\" being built in Amsterdam. Because of intelligence provided by Bancroft, the British successfully pressured the Dutch to cancel the sale of the ship. Nevertheless, with smaller vessels, Jones successfully raided coastal towns in England and Ireland and captured two British warships despite regular intelligence provided the British by Bancroft. Unaware that Bancroft was a British spy, Jones and Bancroft became close friends, and Jones even used him as an intermediary with Franklin. In the summer of 1777, Arthur Lee charged that Bancroft had met with members of king's privy council; and in April 1778, a sea captain named Musco Livingston told Lee that in London he had seen a letter written by Bancroft that provided details about the French treaty before it had been signed. When Lee accused Bancroft of being a traitor, Jones came to his defense; and in early 1779, Jones convinced Livingston to retract his accusation. (Livingston's accusations had been true, but the rumor that Bancroft had met with the privy council was not.)\n\nOn January 19, 1777, Franklin wrote to Juliana Ritchie, a woman living in a Benedictine convent in Cambrai, that even if he suspected his valet to be a spy, \"as he probably is, I think I should not discharge him for that, if in other Respects I lik'd him.\" Although some historians believe the letter indicates Franklin's suspicion of Bancroft, others have noted that after the war, Franklin remained on good terms with Bancroft while he shunned other Loyalists, including his own son, William. The vast majority of historians reject the thesis that Franklin was in any way disloyal to the United States.\n\nAfter the death of former American diplomat Silas Deane in 1789 aboard a ship about to sail to America, Bancroft suggested in a private conversation that Deane had committed suicide. The following year an anonymous pamphlet, \"Theodosius\", attacked the scientist and clergyman Joseph Priestley by claiming that while dying, Deane had uttered blasphemous and atheistic statements that he had supposedly derived from Priestley. Priestley, who had never met Deane, pleaded with Bancroft to set the record straight. Bancroft responded by publishing in several newspapers an account provided by the ship's captain, which stated that Deane had become suddenly ill and had been unable to say anything comprehensible during the four hours before his death.\n\nIn 1959, historian Julian Boyd suggested that Bancroft might have poisoned Deane, then spread rumors that Deane had committed suicide in an attempt to cover up the murder. In the years since Boyd's articles appeared, his thesis has been largely dismissed as \"ungrounded conjectures\"; nevertheless, the theory has been widely publicized in a popular American textbook: James West Davidson and Mark Hamilton Lytle, \"After the Fact: The Art of Historical Detection\" (Boston: McGraw Hill, 1982 [sixth edition, 2010]).\n\nFollowing the Revolutionary War, Bancroft obtained patents to import black oak into Britain and France to be turned into a yellow dye called quercitron; and he convinced John Paul Jones to invest a large sum in the business. In 1789 Jones accused Bancroft of fraud and withholding money owed him. Gouverneur Morris tried to mediate the dispute, and Bancroft did make small payments to Jones; but when Jones died in July 1792, Bancroft apparently still owed him £1,800.\n\nIn 1794, Bancroft published \"Experimental Researches Concerning the Philosophy of Permanent Colors\", a book he updated in 1814. He was also elected a Foreign Honorary Member of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1797. Bancroft's wife, Penelope, died on May 10, 1784 at home in London while Bancroft was on a trip to Philadelphia. Bancroft himself died on September 7, 1821, at Addington Place in Margate. Bancroft's activity as a double agent was not revealed until 1891, when British diplomatic papers were released to the public.\n\n\nCitations\nSources\n"}

He is credited with starting Hawaii's conversion to Christianity. His name was usually spelled Obookiah during his lifetime. His name Henry is sometimes Hawaiianized as Heneri.\n\n`Ōpūkaha`ia was born at Ka`ū on the island of Hawai`i in 1792. When he was 10, his family was murdered by Hawaiian warriors. In 1807, when Captain Caleb Britnall took him aboard the \"Triumph\", the teenage boy had his first English lessons en route to New Haven, Connecticut, along with fellow Hawaiian cabin boy Thomas Hopu. As a student in the New Haven area, he was looked after in a succession of homes, and worked summers to help earn his keep. The future Reverend Edwin W. Dwight, a senior in Yale College at the time, met him in 1809, when he discovered`Ōpūkaha`ia sitting on the steps of the college. When `Ōpūkaha`ia lamented that \"No one give me learning,\" Dwight agreed to help him find tutoring. `Ōpūkaha`ia took up residence with one of Dwight's relatives, Yale president Timothy Dwight IV, a founder of the American Board of Commissioners for Foreign Missions, who instructed him in Christian and secular subjects. He had studied English grammar and the usual curriculum in public schools by the time he converted to Christianity in 1815, during the Second Great Awakening.\n\nHe and other Polynesians and Native Americans requested training to spread the Gospel back home. This inspired the founding of the Foreign Mission School in 1816, administered from Boston by the American Board of Commissioners for Foreign Missions (ABCFM). It had broad support from the residents of Cornwall, Connecticut, where it moved in 1817, and from donors elsewhere in Connecticut, Massachusetts and New York. During its ten years, about 100 students attended: \"43 Native Americans, 13 Americans (white), and 20 Hawaiians, and other natives of the Pacific. including 2 Chinese\".\n\nEven before this school opened, Edwin Dwight wrote in 1818, `Ōpūkaha`ia had begun \"'reducing to system his own native tongue. As it was not a written language, but lay in its chaotic state, every thing was to be done…he had made some progress towards completing a Grammar, a Dictionary, and a Spelling-book.'\" However, these books no longer exist. Samuel B. Ruggles, one of the First Company of missionaries to Hawaii and a fellow student of `Ōpūkaha`ia at Cornwall, mentions in an 1819 letter that his own grammar was \"much assisted by one which `Ōpūkaha`ia attempted to form.\" Elisha Loomis, who was to be printer for the first mission, was inspired to join it by reading `Ōpūkaha`ia's memoirs, edited by Dwight in the year of his death from fever, over a year before the First Company set sail from Boston.\n\n`Ōpūkaha`ia planned to return to Hawaii himself to preach, but contracted typhus fever and died in 1818 in Cornwall at the age of 26.\n\nIn 1826 the Foreign Mission School was closed by a scandal – two interracial marriages were too much for Cornwall residents. But both the school and `Ōpūkaha`ia were a catalyst for the Sandwich Island Mission and for the first concentrated efforts to analyse the language.\n\nIn 1993, `Ōpūkaha`ia's family decided to return his body from his grave in Connecticut to Hawaii. On Aug. 15, 1993, his remains were laid in a vault facing the sea at Kahikolu Church near the town of Napoopoo, Kona, on the Island of Hawaii. It was the third church established in Hawaii by missionaries inspired by Opukahaia. Hawaii's churches observe the third Sunday in February as a day of commemoration in honor of its first Christian. A plaque at the Cornwall gravesite reads: \"In July of 1993, the family of Henry Opukahaia took him home to Hawaii for interment at Kahikolu Congregational Church Cemetery, Napo'opo'o, Kona, Island of Hawaii. Henry's family expresses gratitude, appreciation and love to all who cared for and loved him throughout the past years. Ahahui O Opukahaia\"\n\nBesides translating the Book of Genesis into Hawaiian, `Ōpūkaha`ia nearly completed a Hawaiian dictionary, grammar, and spelling book. The \"Memoirs of Henry Obookiah\" were published in New York City in 1818 and have been republished by the Woman's Board of Missions for the Pacific Islands several times since the 1960s. They have recently republished the 195-year-old book with a new epilogue of how his body was returned to the Big Island of Hawaii, along with new photographs.\n"}

She then moved to the local primary school at Brandon Park Primary School in 1972 before moving to Brentwood Secondary College. In year 9 she transferred to Korowa Anglican Girls' School.\n\nIn 1981, Engel was one of four Victorians chosen to compete in the First Invitational Junior Games at Newcastle Upon Tyne, UK. The other juniors were Peta Jayne Goodwin, Rodney Young and Paul Stitt. When Engel returned to Australia, she had won many medals in swimming events and also track and field.\n\nAfter that, she competed in the Melbourne Senior Nationals and began training a lot more after school. She was coached in swimming at North Lodge Swimming academy under June O'Doherty ('Mrs Boss') and track and field training was overseen by one of the senior Paravics athletes, Ivan Rasojovic.\n\nWhile studying in year 10 she was selected to compete in the FESPIC Games in Sha Tin, Hong Kong. She continued to train at Northlodge during the same era as Greg Fasala who was trained by Jim O'Doherty ('Boss') so the pool deck often held cheering kids watching both overseas athletes do time trials. Two PE teacher students, Paul and Tim Hannon, were the track coaches. At the same time she was coached at Monash University's pool by the Paravics coaches, Greg Frost and then Brian where she met fellow wheelchair sports athletes. Engel swam at the same meet as Fasala when the First Australia Day Games occurred in Melbourne and remembers walking in the parade at the Glass House alongside the 'Mean Machine'.\n\nShe swam personal bests in freestyle and backstroke (100 m and 100 m) as well as track events, winning bronze and silver medals in swimming at FESPIC Games. Dawn Fraser was the team motivator and Engel recalls the Australian swimmer leading the 'Aussie, Aussie, Aussie' chant in the arena as the team made its entrance. Throughout her career, Engel competed in class 5, though she was borderline class 4, which was apparent when she swam against Sue at the border class between Victoria and South Australia in a few Mt Gambier competitions.\n\nThe highlight of Engel's swimming career was representing Australia at the 1984 Summer Paralympics. She won bronze in the 400 m Freestyle event in a personal best time of 7.11 in Class 5.\n\nAs a result of this, she represented students on Monash University's Sports And Recreation Association Executive between 1984-1989 whilst undertaking her Bachelor of Arts. She was awarded a Full Blue in 1984 and inducted into the Monash University Hall of Fame in 2005. Overall Engel competed in four Senior National Games in the years 1981, 1984, 1986 and 1988.\n\nEngel received special permission to join Northlodge A.U.S.S.I. when she was 23 although people generally needed to be over 30 to swim in MASTERS. She swam in a number of short and long meets with the Northlodge Neptune team.\n\nEngel also had fun sharing her swimming skills by training Paravics' juniors, and playing a little bit of wheelchair tennis (in Frankston) and basketball (at Preston) but was happier in the pool. Her team contained other notable Paralympic swimmers such as Anne Currie, who was also in the 1984 Paralympics, but competed on Long Island.\nAlthough born with spina bifida, Engel swam against other athletes with paralysis and spinal injuries such as polio and cerebral palsy.\nShe was Team Captain in the Perth Nationals.\n\nIn 1991, Engel received a Bachelor of Arts from Monash University. She returned to competitive swimming in 1994 while working at World Vision Australia to swim in Beijing's FESPIC Games and was pleased with swimming comparative and faster times to her 1983 personal best. She came away with 2 Gold and one Silver.\n\nIn 1999, she co-wrote the book \"Challenge and Hope: Disability, Disease and Trauma in the Developing World\" with Jill Burn.\n\nEngel is married and lives in Western Australia. In 2014 she graduated with a Masters in Human Rights from Curtin University.She gained her Cert IV TAE and runs Kerrie Duff Consulting . In her spare time Engel enjoys sharing her life experiences at community events such as 2016 Anti Poverty Week or 2017 TedxPerth as a Living Book through The Human Library project.\n"}

(December 9, 1579 – November 3, 1639), was a Peruvian lay brother of the Dominican Order who was beatified in 1837 by Pope Gregory XVI and canonized in 1962 by Pope John XXIII. He is the patron saint of mixed-race people, barbers, innkeepers, public health workers, and all those seeking racial harmony.\n\nHe was noted for his work on behalf of the poor, establishing an orphanage and a children's hospital. He maintained an austere lifestyle, which included fasting and abstaining from meat. Among the many miracles attributed to him were those of levitation, bilocation, miraculous knowledge, instantaneous cures, and an ability to communicate with animals.\n\nJuan Martin de Porres Velázquez was born in the city of Lima, in the Viceroyalty of Peru, on December 9, 1579. He was the illegitimate son of a Spanish nobleman, Don Juan de Porres, and Ana Velázquez, a freed slave from Panama, of African or possibly part Native American descent. He had a sister named Juana, born two years later in 1581. After the birth of his sister, the father abandoned the family. Ana Velázquez supported her children by taking in laundry. He grew up in poverty and, when his mother could not support him, Martin was confided to a primary school for two years, and then placed with a barber/surgeon to learn the medical arts. He spent hours of the night in prayer, a practice which increased as he grew older.\n\nUnder Peruvian law, descendants of Africans and Native Americans were barred from becoming full members of religious orders. The only route open to Martin was to ask the Dominicans of Holy Rosary Priory in Lima to accept him as a \"donado\", a volunteer who performed menial tasks in the monastery in return for the privilege of wearing the habit and living with the religious community. At the age of 15 he asked for admission to the Dominican Convent of the Rosary in Lima and was received first as a servant boy, and as his duties grew he was promoted to almoner.\n\nMartin continued to practice his old trades of barbering and healing and was said to have performed many miraculous cures. He also took on kitchen work, laundry, and cleaning. After eight years at Holy Rosary, the prior Juan de Lorenzana, decided to turn a blind eye to the law and permit Martin to take his vows as a member of the Third Order of Saint Dominic. Holy Rosary was home to 300 men, not all of whom accepted the decision of De Lorenzana: one of the novices called Martin a \"mulatto dog\", while one of the priests mocked him for being illegitimate and descended from slaves.\n\nWhen Martin was 24, he was allowed to profess religious vows as a Dominican lay brother in 1603. He is said to have several times refused this elevation in status, which may have come about due to his father's intervention, and he never became a priest. It is said that when his convent was in debt, he implored them: \"I am only a poor mulatto, sell me.\" Martin was deeply attached to the Blessed Sacrament, and he was praying in front of it one night when the step of the altar he was kneeling on caught fire. Throughout all the confusion and chaos that followed, he remained where he was, unaware of what was happening around him.\nWhen Martin was 34, after he had been given the religious habit of a lay brother, he was assigned to the infirmary, where he was placed in charge and would remain in service until his death at the age of 59. He was known for his care of the sick. His superiors saw in him the virtues necessary to exercise unfailing patience in this difficult role. It was not long before miracles were attributed to him. Martin also cared for the sick outside his convent, often bringing them healing with only a simple glass of water. He ministered without distinction to Spanish nobles and to slaves recently brought from Africa. One day an aged beggar, covered with ulcers and almost naked, stretched out his hand, and Martin took him to his own bed. One of his brethren reproved him. Martin replied: \"Compassion, my dear Brother, is preferable to cleanliness.\"\n\nWhen an epidemic struck Lima, there were in this single Convent of the Rosary 60 friars who were sick, many of them novices in a distant and locked section of the convent, separated from the professed. Martin is said to have passed through the locked doors to care for them, a phenomenon which was reported in the residence more than once. The professed, too, saw him suddenly beside them without the doors having been opened. Martin continued to transport the sick to the convent until the provincial superior, alarmed by the contagion threatening the friars, forbade him to continue to do so. His sister, who lived in the country, offered her house to lodge those whom the residence of the religious could not hold. One day he found on the street a poor Indian, bleeding to death from a dagger wound, and took him to his own room until he could transport him to his sister's hospice. The prior, when he heard of this, reprimanded him for disobedience. He was extremely edified, however, by his reply: \"Forgive my error, and please instruct me, for I did not know that the precept of obedience took precedence over that of charity.\" The prior gave him liberty thereafter to follow his inspirations in the exercise of mercy.\n\nMartin did not eat meat. He begged for alms to procure necessities the convent could not provide. In normal times, Martin succeeded with his alms to feed 160 poor persons every day, and distributed a remarkable sum of money every week to the indigent. Side by side with his daily work in the kitchen, laundry and infirmary, Martin's life is said to have reflected extraordinary gifts: ecstasies that lifted him into the air, light filling the room where he prayed, bilocation, miraculous knowledge, instantaneous cures and a remarkable rapport with animals. He founded a residence for orphans and abandoned children in the city of Lima.\n\nMartin was a friend of both St. Juan Macías, a fellow Dominican lay brother, and St. Rose of Lima, a lay Dominican. By the time he died, on November 3, 1639, he had won the affection and respect of many of his fellow Dominicans as well as a host of people outside the priory. Word of his miracles had made him known as a saint throughout the region. As his body was displayed to allow the people of the city to pay their respects, each person snipped a tiny piece of his habit to keep as a relic. It is said that three habits were taken from the body. His body was then interred in the grounds of the monastery.\n\nAfter De Porres died, the miracles and graces received when he was invoked multiplied in such profusion that his body was exhumed after 25 years and said to be found intact, and exhaling a fine fragrance. Letters to Rome pleaded for his beatification; the decree affirming the heroism of his virtues was issued in 1763 by Pope Clement XIII.\n\nPope Gregory XVI beatified Martin de Porres on October 29, 1837, and nearly 125 years later, Pope John XXIII canonized him in Rome on May 6, 1962. He is the patron saint of people of mixed race, and of innkeepers, barbers, public health workers and more, with a feast day on November 3.\n\nMartin is also commemorated in the Calendar of Saints of the Church of England on November 3.\n\nHe is recognised as \"Papa Candelo\" in the Afro-Caribbean-Catholic syncretist religion, which is practised in places where African diaspora culture thrives such as Puerto Rico, the Dominican Republic, Cuba, the United States, and his native Peru.\n\nMartin de Porres is often depicted as a young mulatto friar wearing the old habit of the Dominican lay brother, a black scapular and capuce, along with a broom, since he considered all work to be sacred no matter how menial. He is sometimes shown with a dog, a cat and a mouse eating in peace from the same dish.\n\nMartin's sometimes defiant attachment to the ideal of social justice achieved deep resonance in a church attempting to carry forward that ideal in today's modern world.\n\nToday, Martin is commemorated by, among other things, a school building that houses the medical, nursing, and rehabilitation science schools of the Dominican University of Santo Tomas in the Philippines.\nA programme of work is also named after him at the Las Casas Institute at Blackfriars Hall, University of Oxford. He is also the titular saint of the parish of St. Martin de Porres in Poughkeepsie, NY, and some elementary schools. A number of Catholic churches are named after him.\n\nIn the 1980 novel \"A Confederacy of Dunces\", Ignatius Reilly contemplates praying to Martin for aid in bringing social justice to the black workers at the New Orleans factory where he works. In music, the first track of jazz pianist Mary Lou Williams's album \"Black Christ of the Andes\" is titled \"St. Martin De Porres.\"\n\nThere are several Spanish and Mexican works regarding his life in cinema and television, starring Cuban actor Rene Muñoz, the most of them referring to his mulatto origin, his miracles and his life of humility. The most known movies are \"Fray Escoba\" (\"Friar Broom\") (1963) and \"Un mulato llamado Martin\" (\"A mulatto called Martin\") (1975).\n\nIn the \"Moone Boy\" episode \"Godfellas\", the character Martin Moon is shown to be named by his grandfather after San Martin De Porres. His grandfather is unable to actually remember any of San Martin's accomplishments, and simply refers to him as \"one of the black ones\" when asked about him.\n\n\n"}

He joined the New Jersey station WJZ in 1921, not just as an announcer but also as a singer, often engaging in recitals with the station's staff pianist, Keith McLeod. By 1927, WJZ had moved to Manhattan and had become the flagship station of the Blue Network of NBC's new national radio network. Cross' voice became familiar as he not only delivered announcements for the Blue Network but also hosted a number of popular programs. Cross was the announcer for the quiz program \"Information Please\" and the musical humor show \"The Chamber Music Society of Lower Basin Street\", among others. In the 1940s Cross hosted a Sunday morning show featuring child performers, called \"Coast To Coast on a Bus\".\n\nFrom 1931 to 1975 Cross served as host for the weekly live broadcasts of the Metropolitan Opera, the job for which he is most remembered. His distinctive voice conveyed the excitement of live performances \"from the stage of the Metropolitan Opera House in New York City\" for generations of radio listeners. Initially, he broadcast from a seat in \"Box 44\" at the old Metropolitan Opera House at Broadway and 40th Street. In 1966, he introduced the radio audience to the Met's new home at Lincoln Center as he hosted a special broadcast of the opening night performance from a modern radio booth in the new house.\n\nFor 43 seasons he was the main (usually sole) commentator. In the 1930s he shared some broadcasts with other commentators, such as Deems Taylor, John B. Kennedy and Marcia Davenport, and Robert Woldrop replaced him (for unknown reasons) for the April 3, 1937 broadcast of \"Das Rheingold\" and the May 15, 1937 broadcast of \"Mignon\". He also missed two later broadcasts (\"Rigoletto\" – February 10, 1973 and \"Norma\" – February 17, 1973) due to the death of his wife. Cross never retired but died in New York from a heart attack during the Met season of 1974–75. His first Met broadcast was Hansel and Gretel on December 25, 1931 and his last was of \"Turandot\" on December 28, 1974, 43 years and 3 days later. He was succeeded by Peter Allen, who had been his standby announcer.\n\nA native New Yorker, Cross died in New York City where he had lived all his life. He is interred at Kensico Cemetery in Valhalla, New York.\n\nCross edited several popular editions of opera synopses, published in conjunction with the Met broadcasts. He also co-authored (with David Ewen) \"Milton Cross' Encyclopedia of the Great Composers and their Music\" – a set of biographies of 78 composers, published in 1953 by Doubleday & Co.\n\nCross was also featured as narrator on several records, including:\n\nCross was parodied in Peter Schickele's album, \"P. D. Q. Bach: The Stoned Guest\". Will Jordan played the role of \"Milton Host\", the host, who gave the commentary and told the listener what the synopsis of the act for the opera was. \nAn earlier parody of Cross came in the character of \"Doktor Quilton Foss\" in \"G.I. Carmen\", an all-soldier musical stage production of the U.S. Army. Billed as \"the Boilesk Voishin\" the show toured occupied Europe from June 9, 1945 through January 24, 1946. Again the host, \"Foss\" introduced the show and offered commentary throughout the evening's proceedings.\n\n"}
{"id": "23558055", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=23558055", "title": "Morton Klein", "text": "Morton Klein\n\nMorton A. Klein is a German-born American economist, statistician, and pro-Israeli activist. He is the president of the Zionist Organization of America (ZOA) and is regarded as one of the leading Jewish activists in the United States. In 2004, he was named one of the top five Jewish leaders in the US today by The Forward. The US Department of State awarded Klein a “Certificate of Appreciation” “in recognition of outstanding contributions to national and international affairs.” In 2018, Klein traveled to Qatar on a paid trip and he accepted $100,000 in contributions to the ZOA from Qatar lobbyist Joey Allaham. ZOA returned the contributions after they were found to not have come from Allaham personally. Also in 2018, Klein referred to a move by Kenneth L. Marcus, the assistant secretary of education for civil rights to open a seven-year-old case brought by the Zionist Organization of America against Rutgers University as a \"groundbreaking decision.\". The case will examine whether or not Rutgers allowed a hostile environment for Jewish students. Klein is a published academic, having served as a lecturer at Temple University in addition to serving as a biostatistician at UCLA School of Public Health and the Linus Pauling Institute of Science and Medicine.\n\nKlein is a child of Holocaust survivors, born in a displaced persons camp in Gunzberg, Germany. At 4 years old, he and his family emigrated from Germany to the United States, where he would grow up in South Philadelphia. He is an economist who served in the Nixon, Ford, and Carter Administrations. He has served as a biostatistician at UCLA School of Public Health and the Linus Pauling Institute of Science and Medicine in Palo Alto, Calif. He has been a lecturer in mathematics and statistics at Temple University.\n\nToday, Klein is member of the International Board of Governors of the Ariel University Center of Samaria.\n\nHis father was a Satmar \"chasid\", an Orthodox Rabbi with \"semicha\" from Moshe Teitelbaum. Klein said in a Jewish Press interview regarding his father that \"In Europe he had a long beard and black hat and was a \"rosh yeshiva\" in his early 20s. But he disagreed with the Satmars on Israel. My father loved Israel, so obviously this was transmitted to me.\"\n\nHe was motivated to enter pro-Israel work while watching the signing of the Oslo Accords in 1993, telling Haaretz, “I only went into the work because I thought Oslo was a disastrous mistake and I wanted a podium to express that. I did not intend to do it for more than a year or two, make my case and then go back to normal life. But things kept getting worse, not better.”\n\nIn 1993, while serving as the organization's Philadelphia chapter president, Klein was elected national president.\n\nThe ZOA web site quotes the following from Klein's Encyclopaedia Judaica entry: \"Klein revived a moribund Zionist Organization of America (ZOA) in the 1990s and made it one of the most outspoken organizations on the American Jewish scene.\" After the Obama administration abstained from using its veto power to block United Nations Security Council Resolution 2334 which stated that Israeli Settlement in the West Bank is a 'flagrant' violation of international law, Klein called Obama \"a Jew-hating antisemite.\"\n\nKlein has stated his belief that the U.S. should engage in religious profiling of Muslims. \"In an era in which the vast majority of terrorism is committed by Muslims, in order to protect American citizens, we should adopt the same profiling policies as Israel and be more thorough in vetting Muslims,\" he told the Forward. Klein said he would also support profiling of Jews under certain circumstances. \"If most terror were committed by Jews I would support profiling Jews.\"\n\nIn February 2012, the ZOA lost its tax-exempt status from the Internal Revenue Service after it failed to file tax returns for three years. The ZOA regained its status in May 2013. Klein said it was a technical \"glitch.\" During the years that the ZOA failed to file tax returns, The Forward reported that Klein's salary increased 38%. In 2014, Steven Goldberg, a Los Angeles attorney and national vice-president of the ZOA, launched a challenge to Klein's presidency, alleging that Klein was mismanaging the ZOA and personally profiting. Klein was later reelected president with 93% of the vote.\n\nThrough his work with the ZOA, Klein was named one of the top dozen “Jewish activists of the century.” The NY Jewish Week ( largest Federation paper) has named him one of the top ten Jewish leaders who have made a difference. The Jewish Press recently stated that “Morton Klein is one of the best minds in this country.”\n\nKlein is an active voice against the Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions movement against Israel, having once even spoken to the issue in an address to the Israeli Knesset. \n\nThrough the Zionist Organization of America, Klein call on the University of Michigan's President and Board of Regents to publicly condemn and severely sanction Professor John Cheney-Lippold after he rescinded an offer to write a letter of recommendation for a student, simply because the student planned to study at a university in Israel. Morton Klein and Susan B. Tuchman, Esq., Director of the ZOA’s Center for Law and Justice, urged the University leadership to take strong and decisive action against Cheney-Lippold: “The University’s leadership expressed its disappointment in Cheney-Lippold’s actions, but that’s not enough. President Schlissel and the Board of Regents must publicly condemn Cheney-Lippold for violating the University’s policies, and severely sanction him for his wrongdoing. Cheney-Lippold cannot be allowed to impose his political agenda on students to impede them from pursuing the academic opportunities of their choosing. If the University leaders fail to take action against Cheney-Lippold, then they will be sending the message to him and to the rest of the faculty that they are free to use their power to violate students’ academic freedom and stand in the way of students studying what they want and where they want.\"\n\nIn a January 18, 2018 article in the Jewish News Syndicate Klein noted that \"Israel’s decision to finally ban 20 of the worst organizations leading the Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions (BDS) movement is necessary for the country’s security, and is sensible and just. BDS is a political and economic warfare movement, often combined with violence and intimidation, that is aimed at eradicating the Jewish state. No sovereign nation should permit the entry of those dedicated to its destruction. Israel, like every nation, has a duty to protect itself. BDS groups and leaders enter Israel to harm the country and its people. They instigate and join weekly violent and disruptive anti-Israel demonstrations, during which they throw rocks at the soldiers serving in the IDF and at Jewish civilians.\"\n\nFollowing the Pittsburgh synagogue shooting the Zionist Organization of America released a sprawling press release about the need to combat anti-Semitism in all forms. Klein is quoted in the release stating: \" It is time to wake up, and for the leaders of all Jewish organizations, Christian and Muslim organizations, local and national government, university and media leaders and social media professionals to meet and join together, and to join with ZOA, in condemning, clamping down on, and countering the daily anti-Semitic activities that the world remains largely silent about, and the evil lies spread against Jews and the Jewish state that are feeding into an atmosphere that encourages and legitimizes attacks on Jews. ZOA urges President Trump to make a major public address on anti-Semitism and bigotry, and quickly fill the post of the head of the government department responsible for fighting anti-Semitism.\" \n\nIn January 2018, Klein went on a paid trip to Qatar at the invitation of the Emir, part of Qatar's public relations efforts to change its reputation within the U.S. Jewish community and the Trump administration. During his visit, he met with a number of senior officials in the country, including the Emir. His visit received \"strong criticism from other supporters of Israel, who warned that the Qataris were using 'pro-Israel' names to whitewash their support for Hamas and other terror organizations.\"\n\nOn June 19, 2018, \"Mother Jones\" reported that Qatar had donated $100,000 to the ZOA through lobbyist Joey Allaham. Allaham first contributed $50,000 to the ZOA on November 2, 2017, shortly before the group's annual gala on November 17 in which former Qatari diplomat Ahmed Al-Rumaihi was present, at the invitation of Allaham. The second $50,000 contribution from Allaham to the ZOA came on January 23, 2018, a few weeks after Klein visited Doha. Klein had been under the impression that the money came from Allaham's own pocket, and later had ZOA return the funds when it was discovered otherwise. \n\nKlein's liaisons with Qatar coincided with the softening of his and the ZOA's tough stance against Qatar. In 2014, for instance, \"the organization urged the US government to designate Qatar as a state sponsor of terrorism for 'funding and promoting Nazi-like organizations that want to kill every Jew.' ... In June 2017, Klein's ZOA had renewed its demand for the State Department to brand Qatar terrorists and had called on the Federal Aviation Authority to bar Qatar Airways from flying in the United States.\" In September 2017, Klein announced that he had refused an invitation to meet with the \"pro-Hamas Emir of the State of Qatar\" on the sidelines of the 2017 United Nations General Assembly. He added that rather than change any of its \"monstrous and evil actions, Qatar may be trying to create the optical illusion of Jewish support to moderate their image by hiring a well-connected PR firm and by having 'secret' meetings with Jewish leaders – which of course won't be a secret, as the whole reason for the meetings may be for the Qataris to point to them as evidence that the 'Jews' (and thus Israel) don't view them as enemies.\"\n\nOn January 20, 2018, shortly after Klein's paid trip to Qatar and just three days before the second $50,000 payment Allaham gave to ZOA on behalf of Qatar, Klein expressed to \"Haaretz\" a new, open attitude to dialogue with Qatar. In a subsequent March 2018 interview, Klein then praised Qatar for flying an Israeli flag at a recent handball tournament and said the emir told him that \"last summer they stopped funding terrorist groups.\" \n\nOn June 6, 2018, the day a federal judge ruled that Joey Allaham \"must turn over any records showing ties to the government of Qatar,\" which would expose later that month his contributions to the ZOA using Qatari money, Klein denounced Qatar for having \"taken some alarming steps backwards\" and said that he \"plan[s] to discuss these serious concerns with my contacts with Members of the House and Senate and the Administration.\"\n\nAllaham told \"The Jerusalem Post\" on June 21 that he is \"proud of the work that Mort Klein has done and all the other Jewish leaders working in collaboration with the Emir and other members of the Qatari Royal Family.\"\n\nOn September 11, 2018 it was reported in the New York Times that Kenneth L. Marcus, the assistant secretary of education for civil rights reopened a seven-year-old case brought by the Zionist Organization of America against Rutgers University, saying the Obama administration, in closing the case, ignored evidence that suggested the school allowed a hostile environment for Jewish students. In a statement on the decision, Klein and Susan B. Tuchman, the director of its Center for Law and Justice noted:\n\n“It took a leader like Kenneth Marcus to finally decide the ZOA’s appeal and to also make it clear that O.C.R. will finally be using a definition of anti-Semitism that makes sense and that reflects how anti-Semitism is so frequently expressed today, particularly on our college campuses,” they wrote. “Hate groups like Students for Justice in Palestine try to convince others that their attacks on Zionism and Israel are legitimate political discourse. But as the State Department definition of anti-Semitism recognizes, these attacks are often a mask for Jew-hatred, plain and simple.”\n\nOn September 12, 2018 in the Tampa Bay Times, again while addressing the decision to reopen the case, Klein stated: \"It's really a breakthrough. Israel bashing and anti-Zionism can cross a line when it becomes anti-Semitism.\"\n\nKlein has appeared on TV and radio including ABC’s World News Tonight (4 minute segment on ZOA “Lobbying for Israel”), NBC National News, Jim Lehrer News Hour, O’Reilly Factor, CNN, Fox-TV, CNBC, MSNBC, NPR, BBC, C-Span, VOA, Israel TV/Radio. Lines from his speeches appear in the respected volume entitled “Great Jewish Quotations,” He is on the speaker’s bureau of UJC, and Israel Bonds.\n\nOn April 24, 2018, through the Zionist Organization of America, Klein issued a statement calling for David Hogg to re-name his book. Klein noted that \"This inappropriate title displays an unkind and shocking insensitivity to Holocaust survivors, Jews, and all decent, human-rights-loving people around the world. Any attempts to compare the genocide of the Holocaust to modern domestic political issues in the US today is shameful and wrong.”\n\nKlein, on a number of occasions, has called for 'free nations' to leave the United Nations Human Right Council citing it's \"perpetual preoccupation with condemning Israel.\"\n\nFollowing Nikki Haley's plan to resign from her position as the United States ambassador to the United Nations on October 9, 2018, Klein in the Times of Israel called Haley's resignation \"a huge loss … a loss for the pro-Israel world and a loss for American foreign policy. She has been a tremendous friend. She was a main factor in putting the Palestinians on notice that if they don’t change their pro-terrorist policies, they will get nothing. She has created a situation where the Palestinians seriously should consider their stances and policies.”\n\nNotably, Klein has been critical of the 'two-state solution' concept noting that Israel is already a sovereign state. In a April 2, 2013 article in the Jerusalem Post Klein wrote: \"This mantra “two-state solution” falsely implies – even claims – that Israel is not yet a state, that it is not a sovereign, independent, UN-sanctioned state until and unless a Palestinian state comes into being alongside it. If this were not the implication, why would anyone be promoting the term “twostate solution”? It also falsely implies that both sides are getting the same thing. Yet Israel is already a state and its legitimacy stands independent of whatever political solution might one day emerge.\"\n\nKlein is a frequent commentator on political matters, particularly when Jewish peoples or Israel is the topic of discussion. Notably, Klein took issue with a tweet made by Ann Coulter during the Republican Party presidential primaries, 2016 where she stated: \"How many f-ing Jews do these people think there are in the US.\" In response, Klein stated in the Jerusalem Post: \"Last night, Ann Coulter made appalling, anti-Jewish remarks which evoked the classic, anti-Semitic trope about Jewish manipulation of America for the purposes of supporting Israel at America's expense. When GOP candidates speak of strengthening the US-Israel relationship which has been harmed by President [Barack] Obama within the context of the need to ensure that Iran doesn't go nuclear; to strengthen America's hand in the world when dealing with vicious totalitarian enemies who seek the demise of the US, they are defending America's interests,\" \n\nFollowing the 2018 Zionist Organization of America dinner Klein stated it was \"political blasphemy\" to place any onus for the 11 murdered in a Pittsburgh synagogue on the president or his heated rhetoric.\n\nKlein is married to Rita, has a married daughter Rachael, and four grandchildren. Klein has Tourette syndrome.\n\nKlein has submitted both written and oral testimony to US Congressional and Israeli Knesset Committees. In 2017, Klein submitted a letter to Congress which stated that: \"...moving the U.S. Embassy to Israel’s capital will achieve tremendous benefits for the United States and our allies throughout the world.\"\n\nKlein has served as a lecturer at Temple University. He has also served as a biostatistician at UCLA School of Public Health and the Linus Pauling Institute of Science and Medicine in Palo Alto, California. He has previously published work in academic journals, specifically on the topic of epidemiology. His research on nutrition and heart disease was cited by Discover Magazine as one of the Top 50 Scientific Studies of 1992. \n"}

Her worldwide breakthrough was with \"Stay As You Are\" (1978). She then came to global prominence with her Golden Globe Award-winning performance as the title character in the Roman Polanski-directed film \"Tess\" (1979). Other notable films in which she acted include the erotic horror film \"Cat People\" (1982), the Wim Wenders dramas \"Paris, Texas\" (1984) and \"Faraway, So Close!\" (1993), and the biographical drama film \"An American Rhapsody\" (2001). Kinski is fluent in four languages: German, English, French and Italian.\n\nKinski was born in Berlin as Nastassja Aglaia Nakszynski. She is the daughter of renowned German actor Klaus Kinski and his second wife, actress Ruth Brigitte Tocki. She is of partial Polish descent as her grandfather Bruno Nakszynski was a Germanized ethnic Pole. Kinski has two half-siblings; Pola and Nikolai Kinski. Her parents divorced in 1968. After the age of 10, Kinski rarely saw her father. Her mother struggled financially to support them. They eventually lived in a commune in Munich.\n\nIn a 1999 interview, Kinski denied that her father had molested her as a child, but said he had abused her \"in other ways.\" In 2013, when interviewed about the allegations of sexual abuse made by her half-sister Pola Kinski, she confirmed that he tried with her, but did not succeed. She said:\n\nKinski began working as a model as a teenager in Germany. Actress Lisa Kreuzer of the German New Wave helped get her the role of the mute Mignon in Wim Wenders 1975 film \"The Wrong Move\", in which at the age of 12 she was depicted topless. She later played one of the leading roles in Wenders' film \"Paris, Texas\" (1984) and appeared in his \"Faraway, So Close\" (1993).\n\nIn 1976, while still a teenager, Kinski had her first two major roles: in Wolfgang Petersen's feature film-length episode \"Reifezeugnis\" of the German TV crime series \"Tatort.\" Next, she appeared in the British horror film \"To the Devil a Daughter\" (1976), produced by Hammer Film Productions, which was released in the UK just 40 days after Kinski's fifteenth birthday, making it a virtual certainty she was only fourteen when her scenes were shot (including full frontal nudity). In regards to her early films, Kinski has stated that she felt exploited by the industry. In an interview with \"W\", she said, \"If I had had somebody to protect me or if I had felt more secure about myself, I would not have accepted certain things. Nudity things. And inside it was just tearing me apart.\"\n\nIn 1978, Kinski starred in the Italian romance \"Stay As You Are\" (\"Così come sei\") with Marcello Mastroianni, gaining her recognition in the United States after New Line Cinema released it there in December 1979. \"Time\" wrote that she was \"simply ravishing, genuinely sexy and high-spirited without being painfully aggressive about it.\" The film also received a major international release from Columbia Pictures.\n\nKinski met the director Roman Polanski at a party in 1976. He urged her to study method acting with Lee Strasberg in the United States and she was offered the title role in Polanski's upcoming film, \"Tess\" (1979). In 1978, Kinski underwent extensive preparation for the portrayal of an English peasant girl, which included acquiring a Dorset accent through elocution studies: \n\nThe film was nominated for six awards, including Best Picture, at the 53rd Academy Awards, and won three.\n\nIn 1981, Richard Avedon photographed Kinski with a Burmese python coiled around her nude body. The image, which first appeared in the October 1981 issue of US \"Vogue\", was released as a poster and became a best-seller, further confirming her status as a sex symbol.\n\nIn 1982, she starred in Francis Ford Coppola's romantic musical \"One from the Heart,\" her first film made in the United States. \"Texas Monthly\" described her as acting \"as a Felliniesque circus performer to represent the twinkling evanescence of Eros.\" The film failed at the box office and was a major loss for Coppola's new Zoetrope Studios. That year, she was also in the erotic horror movie \"Cat People\". Dudley Moore's comedy \"Unfaithfully Yours\" and an adaptation of John Irving's \"The Hotel New Hampshire\" followed in 1984.\n\nKinski reteamed with Wenders for the 1984 film \"Paris, Texas\". One of her most acclaimed films to date, it won the top award at the Cannes Film Festival. Throughout the 1980s, Kinski split her time between Europe and the United States, making \"Moon in the Gutter\" (1983), \"Harem\" (1985) and \"Torrents of Spring\" (1989) in Europe, and \"Exposed\" (1983), \"Maria's Lovers\" (1984) and \"Revolution\" (1985) in the United States.\n\nDuring the 1990s, Kinski appeared in a number of American films, including the action movie \"Terminal Velocity\" opposite Charlie Sheen, the Mike Figgis 1997 adultery tale \"One Night Stand\", \"Your Friends & Neighbors\" (1998), John Landis' \"Susan's Plan\" (1998), and \"The Lost Son\" (1999).\n\nHer most recent films include David Lynch's \"Inland Empire\" (2006) and Rotimi Rainwater's \"Sugar\" (2013). In 2016, she competed in the German \"Let's Dance\" show.\n\nIn 1976, when Kinski was 15, she reportedly began a romantic relationship with then 43-year-old director Roman Polanski. In a 1999 \"Guardian\" interview, she was quoted as saying that there was categorically no affair and that, \"There was a flirtation. There could have been a seduction, but there was not. He had respect for me.\"\n\nIn the mid-1980s, Kinski met the Egyptian filmmaker Ibrahim Moussa. They married on 10 September 1984. They have two children together; a son Aljosha (born 1984), and daughter (born 1986), who works as a model and actress. The marriage was dissolved in 1992. From 1992 until 1995, Kinski lived with musician Quincy Jones, though she kept her own apartment on Hilgard Avenue, near UCLA, at the time. In 1993, they had a daughter, Kenya Julia Miambi Sarah Jones, a model known professionally as Kenya Kinski-Jones.\n\nIn 2001, Kinski stated in an interview for \"The Daily Telegraph\" she was affected by the sleep disorder narcolepsy.\n\n\n"}

Every year, on 27 June, is organized in Konispol the \"Cham March\", remembering the expulsions of Cham Albanians.\n\nIn March 1991, the first national conference of the Chameria Political Association (CPA) was held in Tirana with many of its activists drawn from the Albanian community who had been expelled from Greece after the war. The CPA intended to bring to international attention the neglected linguistic, cultural, and educational rights of Orthodox Cham Albanians who have been subjected to a Greek policy of assimilation. The group has also launched campaigns on behalf of Cham exiles in Albania. It has encouraged the expansion of contacts with compatriots in Greece, the return of exiles to their family areas, and the payment of compensation for property and land that was illegally taken from them during their expulsion.\n\nSince 1991, Albanian activists across the political spectrum have become more outspoken on the Chameria issue vis-à-vis Greece. Historic grievances over Greek repression of Orthodox and Muslim Albanians earlier this century have been aired, and Athens has been criticized for its ongoing assimilationist pressures against Orthodox Albanians who still reside in the Chameria, Epirus region. Although the Greek authorities have denied that any Cham problem exists, Cham representatives have continued to urge the Albanian government to take up the issue with Athens at the highest bilateral levels.\n\nOne particularly disingenuous endeavour by the organization leaders has been to create historical links in the public mind by presenting the ancient Greek King Pyrrhus of Epirus (4th-3rd century BC) as an Albanian hero, thus revealing the extreme and irredentist aims of the association.\n"}

Previously he served as a Supreme Court judge. He was born and brought up in Darbhanga district in the Indian State of Bihar with his maternal uncle's home to a Nepali parents - according to Hindu traditions. His father's belongs to historical Mithila region of Nepal, and so he is a descendent native citizen and federal subject of Nepal. Jha resigned as a judge in December 2007 after he was not proposed by the Judicial Council as a permanent judge at the apex court, following allegations of involvement in drug smuggling. Later, Jha joined political life and became a member of the Madhesi Janadhikar Forum, one of several organizations agitating against dominance of Nepal's politics by the minority ruling elite Bahuns (hill Brahmins) of Pahari population against the Madhesi origin Nepalis. On 19 July 2008, he was elected as Vice-President of Nepal by the Constituent Assembly.\n\nHe began his first term of office as Vice-President of Nepal on 23 July 2008 by taking the oath of office from President Ram Baran Yadav at the Sheetal Niwas Presidential Palace in Maithili (despite he intended to take oath in Hindi) in the presence of Prime Minister Girijaprasad Koirala and others.\n\nJha's legitimacy as Vice-President was challenged for taking the oath of office in Hindi by Nepalis. Jha's mother tongue is Maithili but he is also fluent in Hindi, Bengali, and English.\n\nA written petition was filed by Advocate Balkrishna Neupane at the apex court claiming that the oath was unconstitutional as it was taken in a language not recognized by the interim constitution. After a year long court procedure, the Supreme Court on 24 July 2009 ordered Jha to retake the oath of office and secrecy for the second time \"in accordance with the Constitution,\" ruling that taking oath in Hindi was not constitutional.\n\nHowever, Jha objected to the Supreme Court verdict, accusing the court of being biased and of conflict of interests. He stated that he would decide whether or not to retake the oath after consulting political parties and the \"people he represents,\" i.e., the Madhesias who principally speak Maithili and Bhojpuri. He demanded changes to the law to ensure that all languages (i.e., Hindi) \"are given due respect.\" \n\nThe Supreme Court's deadline for retaking the oath expired on 30 August 2009. As Jha did not swear once again the oath of office, the office was considered to have become vacant from 31 August 2009. In order to maintain political and ethnic inclusiveness, the Nepalese government did not seek a new Vice-President but continued to work with Jha towards a compromise, seeking to re-instate him. Changes were made to the law to allow the oath of office to be taken in native ethnic languages, e.g., Jha's native Maithili, and on 7 February 2010, he accordingly took a fresh oath of office as Vice-President in the Maithili language.\n\n"}

She is well known for her work in the rescue and rehabilitation of gorillas and chimpanzees, as well as fighting the illegal bush meat trade in West Africa.\n\nRachel Hogan was born in Birmingham, England and her interest in animals started during her childhood, when she had toy gorillas instead of dolls.\n\nIn 2003, Hogan was appointed manager of the National Park. During her tenure, she and her team have transformed Mefou into one of the largest, most well known primate conservation charities in Africa.\n\nIn October 2008, Hogan was awarded the IFAW Animal Action Award at a ceremony at the House of Lords. The IFAW awards ceremony was hosted by patron Baroness Gale and wildlife TV presenter Shauna Lowry announced the winners.\n\nHaving attracted several celebrities and renowned wildlife photographers to visit the Mefou National Park, Hogan organised a photographic exhibition at the Djeuga Palace Hotel in Yaounde in early October 2010.

From then on, the group travelled across Europe and had a huge influence on the emerging free tekno scene. Whilst doing so, members of the collective have released seminal records on both their own label Network 23 as well as enjoying a brief spell of crossover success on the mainstream Big Life label.\n\nOn New Year's Eve 1991, a rave was held at the then empty Roundhouse venue in Camden, London, which was to last for a week.\n\nIn May 1992, what would become the most well known and largest party the group had involvement in, also proved to be the most controversial. The Castlemorton Common Festival would turn out to be an unintended consequence of Police preventing travellers heading for the annual Avon Free Festival. Thirteen members of Spiral Tribe were arrested immediately after the Castlemorton event and subsequently charged with public order offences. Their trial became one of the longest-running and most expensive cases in British legal history, lasting four months and costing the UK £4 million. Spiral Tribe first use the slogan \"Make some fucking noise\" on T-shirts which they wore in the court room. The judge ordered them to remove these garments. However, when the female defendants revealed that they wore nothing underneath their T-shirts, the judge reversed his instructions, something quite rare in UK courts. Regarding Castlemorton, Nigel South states that \"the adverse publicity attending the event laid the groundwork for the Criminal Justice Act 1994\". \nLow and Barnett opine in \"Spaces of Democracy\" that \"Spiral Tribe, with their free and inclusive parties, succeeded in constituting an alternative public space, rather than just a secret one.\".\n\nAfter being acquitted of all charges relating to Castlemorton in March 1993, the group moved to Europe shortly after, doing parties in cities such as Rotterdam, Paris, and Berlin.

Prior to that he was President of the National Development Council (Parliament of Rwanda) 1988–1994. \n\nBorn in the town of Butare in the south of Rwanda, Sindikubwabo was educated as a physician, and was Minister of Health in the administration of President Kayibanda. Following the takeover by Juvénal Habyarimana, Sindikubwabo became a practising pediatrician in Kigali Central Hospital. He later returned to politics as a deputy in parliament.\n\nImmediately following Habyarimana's assassination on April 6, 1994, Sindikubwabo was installed as interim President by the Crisis Committee controlled by Colonel Théoneste Bagosora, and he was the head of state during the genocide. Sindikubwabo is widely believed to have been a puppet of the group of military officers who held the real power. On 19 April 1994, he made a now infamous speech at the ceremony appointing a new \"Préfet\" (Governor) of Butare that was broadcast on national radio, in which he insulted those who were not \"working\", a euphemism for killing Tutsis, and told them to \"get out of the way and let us work\". On 29 April, he returned to Butare and told the populace that he was there to supervise the killing of Tutsi. On an 18 May visit to Kibuye Prefecture, he congratulated the people on how well they had done their \"work\". \n\nFollowing the invasion of the Rwandese Patriotic Front that took control of the country and ended the genocide, Sindikubwabo fled to Zaire (now the Democratic Republic of the Congo), where he lived in exile in Bukavu. He was interviewed there for the book \"We Wish to Inform You That Tomorrow We Will Be Killed With Our Families\" and quoted as saying: \"The moment has not yet come to say who is guilty and who is not guilty.\" He was initially reported to have been killed in the Rwandan government attack on Bukavu in November 1996 at the beginning of the First Congo War, but subsequent reports put him in Kinshasa. He died in exile in Democratic Republic of the Congo in the late 1990s of natural causes and was never charged by the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda.\n\n"}

He was one of the most active and influential horticulturists in Australia in the mid-to-late 19th century. Among the first viticulturists in Australia, Macarthur was a medal-winning wine-maker, as well as a respected amateur botanist and noted plant breeder.\n\nWilliam Macarthur was born at Parramatta in December 1800, the fifth son of John and Elizabeth Macarthur, pioneers of the Australian wool industry. He was educated in England at Rugby School, returned to Australia with his father in 1817, and assisted in the management of his estates. These estates included land controlled by the Macarthurs south along the Murrumbidgee River from Gundagai. Brothers James and William Macarthur stocked 'Nangus Station' with cattle in 1831. The island in the middle of the River at Nangus is marked as one of the early goldfields and named \"M'Arthur Island\". The island is where the highly auriferous Adelong Creek enters the Murrumbidgee River. William pursued a slight career in colonial politics, though this was secondary to his interests in botany. William lived at Camden Park, south west of Sydney, with his brother James who was prominent in local and colonial politics.\n\nIn 1844, William Macarthur, regarded at the time as a leading Australian viticulturist, published a small volume, \"Letters on the Culture of the Vine, Fermentation, and the Management of the Cellar\", which was widely read. He was President of New South Wales Vineyard Association and had a vineyard and extensive cellars at the family estate at Camden Park.\n\nMacarthur was a competent botanist, horticulturist and agriculturist, and his operations helped to make Camden Park celebrated. He entertained eminent scientific men who visited the Colony and bore the reputation of a cultured gentleman. He sent plants to James Backhouse which are now in the Herbarium at the Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew and the British Museum. The extensive catalogues of his Camden Park Nursery, published in 1843, 1845, 1850 and 1857, provide a valuable insight both into the contents of colonial gardens and to the international exchange of plants in the early-to-mid-19th century. 'Aspasia macarthur', bred at Camden Park, was the first Australian cultivar of the camellia.\n\nMacarthur is commemorated in the genus \"Macarthuria\" , also in the species: \"Cyathea macarthurii\" and \"Ptychosperma macarthurii\"\n\nIn 1849 he was elected a member of the New South Wales Legislative Council for the Electoral district of Port Phillip. Macarthur represented New South Wales at the Paris International Exhibition of 1855, where his fluency in French was invaluable in resolving initial confusion over the areas allotted to the Australian colonies. A selection of Australian timber specimens from the Exposition are displayed at Camden Park. Shortly afterwards he was knighted. After his return to Australia in 1857, he was appointed a member of the Legislative Council, but he never took a prominent part in politics and was more at home with his pastoral pursuits, having been given stewardship of his family's landmark pastoral property Camden Park. He was also an active in club life and served as the president of the Australian Club.\n\nHe died unmarried on 29 October 1882. His estate, along with those of his brothers James and Sir Edward, was left to his niece, James' daughter Elizabeth, wife of Arthur Alexander Walton Onslow. After Arthur's death, Elizabeth changed her name to Macarthur-Onslow.\n\n\n"}
