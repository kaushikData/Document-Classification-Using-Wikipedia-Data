Adaptive clothing typically offers rear-closure designs so that an individual can be dressed more easily by a carer. For example, rather than buttons and zippers, Velcro may be used for garment closures. A common misconception of adaptive clothing is that it is only for wheelchair users or others that suffer from severe disabilities. Whilst these groups do benefit from the garments, adaptive clothing is for anyone that can be limited by traditional clothing. \n\nAdaptive clothing is specialised clothing that is modified to enable easier dressing for people with a disability. The clothing is modified to help people with a high degree of disability and their carers or to assist individuals with a lower degree of disability to dress independently.\n\nAdaptive clothing can benefit people of all ages with disorders or natural ageing such as the following:\n\n\nAdaptive clothing typically incorporates flat seams to reduce friction, and discreet adaptations to make the clothing look as consistent with fashion norms as possible, including: easy access snaps, Velcro, stretchy fabric, roomy design to accommodate incontinence aids, longer rise in the back to accommodate sitting in wheelchairs, and elastic waist for increased comfort and easier dressing.\n\nFor individuals suffering from Parkinson's and other disabilities that affect motor skills, magnetic closures have emerged as a great solution across multiple garments. The original technology was developed by MagnaReady and was patented in December of 2015. The technology was licensed for numerous lines of adaptive clothing by brands including Van Heusen and MagnaClick. Magnetic closures again came to the forefront of adaptive clothing when Tommy Hilfiger featured magnetic closures prominently in the launch of their adaptive clothing line in the Spring of 2018. Silvert's Adaptive Clothing & Footwear also carry magnetic closure dress shirts for both men and women.\n"}
{"id": "20045004", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=20045004", "title": "Alfaskop", "text": "Alfaskop\n\nAlfaskop was a brand, developed in Sweden by Standard Radio & Telefon AB (SRT) and applied to data terminals and later IBM-compatible PCs. The term was also used to name Alfaskop AB, a listed Swedish IT services company., that filed for bankruptcy in 2001.\n\nSRT, owned by the ITT Corporation during the 1960s, specialised in Air Traffic Control systems and military radar systems. In 1971, SRT provided the core technology for Stansaab AS, a joint venture with Saab and the state-owned Swedish Development Company. The company’s primary focus was systems for real-time data applied to commercial and aviation applications. To this was added the data terminal operations of Facit in 1972. \nThe Alfaskop terminals quickly gained a foothold in the market for airline reservations with 1,000 in use at Scandinavian Airlines alone.\n\nIn 1978, Stansaab was merged with the Data Saab division of Saab to form Datasaab. In 1981, Ericsson, believing that growth in telecoms would be lower than that in IT, purchased Datasaab and integrated it with two of its own divisions to form Ericsson Information Systems (EIS). Accurately predicting convergence between telephony and data technologies, EIS instructed the Alfaskop group to begin working on a design for Ericsson's first PC – the EPC, which was released 16 months later in 1984.\n\nFollowing market difficulties in the United States, particularly with a disappointing launch of its PC, Ericsson decided to abandon its \"paperless office\" strategy. In 1988, the division was sold to Nokia and later to ICL in 1990. The final act was its sale by ICL to Wyse Technology who eventually wound down manufacturing.\n\nDue to its work for the aviation industry, one of SRT’s core competencies was the display of radar images. It was this expertise that led to the development of the Alfaskop terminal, which was inspired by the launch of IBM's range of display terminals. These terminals made interaction with computers much easier than with earlier punched card or paper tape interfaces. The alphanumeric, 80 character, 24 line terminal quickly became a standard. The Alfaskop terminals were designed to be pin compatible with the IBM equipment. The Alfaskop 3100, the first model, was designed to compete with the IBM 2260, while the later 3500 was developed in response to the IBM 3270. There followed a refreshed 3500 called System 37 followed by a System 41 – a new design.\n\nThe first Ericsson PC - the EPC, was released at the CeBit fair in Hanover in 1984. The Ericsson Portable PC followed a year later. In subsequent years, with the growth in demand for IBM-compatible PCs, several Alfaskop PC models were released.\n\nWhile Ericsson had tried to build its own brand in the PC business, Nokia was willing to trade on the Alfaskop name. By 1989, they were showing the “Alfaskop Workgroup System” comprising 80386-based servers, 80286-based desktops and ethernet or token ring networking. Office software included the X400-compatible Alfaskop Mail, WordPerfect and Lotus Freelance. The systems were offered with either MS-DOS or OS/2.\n\nThe Alfaskop terminals enjoyed considerable success, even outselling IBM in some markets, particularly in Sweden. By the early 1980s the company had accumulated profits of about one billion kronor. Customers included airlines, newspapers, police, councils and telecommunications companies.\n\nA key benefit of the terminals was that they were IBM compatible but cost less. This meant discounts for volume customers made the terminals attractive. Reflecting the profit contribution made by Alfaskop (other product ranges at Stansaab/Datasaab were losing money), Ericsson invested 40 million kronor in the manufacturing facility at Järfalla outside Stockholm. Ericsson had predicted that their Eritex workstation comprising a telex and data terminal would take over from Alfaskop but demand continued with 100,000 units sold by 1983 with annual sales climbing above 25,000. Eritex was retired by the mid-1980s. Deliveries of Alfaskop continued through the Nokia years and by the time production ceased, more than 900 000 units had been shipped.\n\nFrom 1990, Nokia Data encouraged the development of several franchise partners to drive sales of PCs and network technologies. From 1994 these companies were co-operating closely and delivering network technologies, Microsoft solutions, and systems integration. In 1995, these companies were merged to form Alfaskop AB.\nIn 1997, the company was listed on the Stockholm Stock Exchange.\n\nBy 2000, Alfaskop had 660 employees with 18 offices in Sweden. However, by 2001, the company was bankrupt and its remaining 400 employees were laid off. Business Wire reported that about half of the employees found employment at Meteorit AB, another IT consultancy.\n"}
{"id": "23960842", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=23960842", "title": "Applied element method", "text": "Applied element method\n\nThe applied element method (AEM) is a numerical analysis used in predicting the continuum and discrete behavior of structures. The modeling method in AEM adopts the concept of discrete cracking allowing it to automatically track structural collapse behavior passing through all stages of loading: elastic, crack initiation and propagation in tension-weak materials, reinforcement yield, element separation, element contact and collision, as well as collision with the ground and adjacent structures.\n\nExploration of the approach employed in the applied element method began in 1995 at the University of Tokyo as part of Dr.Hatem Tagel-Din's research studies. The term \"applied element method\" itself, however, was first coined in 2000 in a paper called \"Applied element method for structural analysis: Theory and application for linear materials\". Since then AEM has been the subject of research by a number of academic institutions and the driving factor in real-world applications. Research has verified its accuracy for: elastic analysis; crack initiation and propagation; estimation of failure loads at reinforced concrete structures; reinforced concrete structures under cyclic loading; buckling and post-buckling behavior; nonlinear dynamic analysis of structures subjected to severe earthquakes; fault-rupture propagation; nonlinear behavior of brick structures; and the analysis of glass reinforced polymers (GFRP) walls under blast loads.\n\nIn AEM, the structure is divided virtually and modeled as an assemblage of relatively small elements. The elements are then connected through a set of normal and shear springs located at contact points distributed along the element faces. Normal and shear springs are responsible for the transfer of normal and shear stresses from one element to the next.\n\nThe modeling of objects in AEM is very similar to modeling objects in FEM. Each object is divided into a series of elements connected and forming a mesh. The main difference between AEM and FEM, however, is how the elements are joined together. In AEM the elements are connected by a series of non-linear springs representing the material behavior.\n\nThere are three types of springs used in AEM:\n\nWhen the average strain value at the element face reaches the separation strain, all springs at this face are removed and elements are no longer connected until a collision occurs, at which point they collide together as rigid bodies.\n\nSeparation strain represents the strain at which adjacent elements are totally separated at the connecting face. This parameter is not available in the elastic material model. For concrete, all springs between the adjacent faces including reinforcement bar springs are cut. If the elements meet again, they will behave as two different rigid bodies that have now contacted each other. For steel, the bars are cut if the stress point reaches ultimate stress or if the concrete reaches the separation strain.\n\nContact or collision is detected without any user intervention. Elements are able to separate, contract and/or make contact with other elements. In AEM three contact methods include Corner-to-Face, Edge-to-Edge, and Corner-to-Ground.\n\nThe spring stiffness in a 2D model can be calculated from the following equations:\n\nWhere \"d\" is the distance between springs, \"T\" is the thickness of the element, \"a\" is the length of the representative area, \"E\" is the Young's modulus, and \"G\" is the shear modulus of the material. The above equation's indicate that each spring represents the stiffness of an area (\"T\"·\"d\") within the length of the studied material.\n\nTo model reinforcement bars embedded in concrete, a spring is placed inside the element at the location of the bar; the area (\"T\"·\"d\") is replaced by the actual cross section area of the reinforcement bar. Similar to modeling embedded steel sections, the area (\"T\"·\"d\") may be replaced by the area of the steel section represented by the spring.\n\nAlthough the element motion moves as a rigid body, its internal deformations are represented by the spring deformation around each element. This means the element shape does not change during analysis, but the behavior of assembly of elements is deformable.\nThe two elements are assumed to be connected by only one pair of normal and shear springs. To have a general stiffness matrix, the locations of element and contact springs are assumed in a general position. The stiffness matrix components corresponding to each degree of freedom are determined by assuming a unit displacement in the studied direction and by determining forces at the centroid of each element. The 2D element stiffness matrix size is 6 × 6; the components of the upper left quarter of the stiffness matrix are shown below:\n\nThe stiffness matrix depends on the contact spring stiffness and the spring location. The stiffness matrix is for only one pair of contact springs. However, the global stiffness matrix is determined by summing up the stiffness matrices of individual pairs of springs around each element. Consequently, the developed stiffness matrix has total effects from all pairs of springs, according to the stress situation around the element. This technique can be used in both load and displacement control cases. The 3D stiffness matrix may be deduced similarly.\n\nThe applied element method is currently being used in the following applications:\n\n\n"}

This application is common on winch drums and chain saws and is also used for some bicycle brakes.\n\nA former application was the locking of gear rings in epicyclic gearing. In modern automatic transmissions this task has been taken over entirely by multiple-plate clutches or multiple-plate brakes.\n\nBand brakes can be simple, compact, rugged, and can generate high force with a light input force. However, band brakes are prone to grabbing or chatter and loss of brake force when hot. These problems are inherent with the design and thus limit where band brakes are a good solution.\n\nOne way to describe the effectiveness of the brake is as formula_1, where formula_2 is the coefficient of friction between band and drum, and formula_3 is the angle of wrap. With a large formula_4, the brake is very effective and requires low input force to achieve high brake force, but is also very sensitive to changes in formula_2. For example, light rust on the drum may cause the brake to \"grab\" or chatter, water may cause the brake to slip, and rising temperatures in braking may cause the coefficient of friction to drop slightly but in turn cause brake force to drop greatly. Using a band material with low formula_2 increases the input force required to achieve a given brake force, but some low-formula_2 materials also have more consistent formula_2 across the range of working temperatures.\n\n"}

The thread is nominally in diameter, with 32 threads per inch, designated as \"1-32 UN 2A\" in the ANSI B1.1 standard for unified screw threads. The flange focal distance is for a C mount.\n\nMerely to say that a lens is \"C-mount\" says very little about the lens' intended use. C-mount lenses have been made for many different formats. C-mount lenses are built for the 8 mm and 16 mm film formats and the 1/3\", 1/2\", 2/3\", 1\", and 4/3\" video formats, which corresponds to a range of image circles approximately from 5 to 22 mm in diameter.\n\nDepending on the format, the design of the lens and its performance will differ considerably. For example, for the 4/3 format, a 12 mm lens is a wide-angle lens and will have a retrofocus design. For the 2/3-inch format, a 12 mm lens is \"normal\" and can have a simple and fast double Gauss layout. For the 1/3-inch format, a 12 mm lens is long and can have a telephoto design.\n\nSome TV lenses lack provision to focus or vary the aperture, so may not operate properly with film cameras. Also, some TV lenses may have bits that protrude behind the mount far enough to interfere with the shutter or reflex finder mechanisms of a film camera.\n\nAlthough C-mount lenses have a back focal distance far too short to be used with 35 mm film SLRs or any existing digital SLR, they can be mounted on interchangeable-lens mirrorless digital cameras. One such system is the Micro Four Thirds, being used by Olympus and Panasonic. However, the vast majority of C-mount lenses produce an image circle too small to effectively cover the entire (micro-)four-thirds sensor, which has approximately 22 mm diagonal. This produces what is popularly called vignetting but is better described as a mismatch between camera format and lens format. The Nikon 1 series and the Pentax Q series can use C-mount lenses without vignetting.\n\nC mount was created by Bell & Howell for their Filmo 70 cine cameras. The earliest Filmos had a slightly different mounts, known as A mount, and B mount. C mount was found on Filmo 70 cameras with serial numbers 54090 and higher, probably from about 1926. Soon after, other camera manufacturers adopted the same mount, and it became a de facto standard for 16 mm cine cameras.\n\nCS-mount has a flange focal distance of , but is otherwise the same as C-mount, including the fact that lenses for many different formats are made for it. CS-mount lenses are built for the smaller formats, 1/2 inch and down.\n\n\n"}

Collectively, they were Pennsylvania's leading iron manufacturer between 1840 and 1870.\n\nAbout 1737, Peter Grubb entered the iron business after discovering the vast and rich Cornwall Iron Mines (Cornwall Banks) in Lebanon County, about 21 miles north of Lancaster. Peter and the next five generations of his descendants operated and expanded the business until they owned or operated in close association with at least 18 iron production operations and several thousand acres of property in eastern Pennsylvania.\n\nGrubb's heirs sold most of the original properties between 1786 and 1803 to Robert Coleman, who became Pennsylvania's first millionaire and whose operations were continued through the 19th century by his heirs. Beginning in 1800, the heirs of Curtis' brother Peter Grubb, Jr. rebuilt their business on the minority interest they retained, primarily in the Cornwall Iron Mines, and operated for nearly 100 years out of Mount Hope. The Grubb and Coleman families were competitors, but also partners due to their shared interests in the ore fields.\n\nBoth families' operations bowed to the advances of iron and steel technology in the latter part of the 19th century and were gradually sold between 1883 and 1926. Many of the Grubb holdings and the Cornwall Iron Mines were sold in 1902 to the Pennsylvania Steel Company (which was itself acquired by the Bethlehem Steel Corporation in 1916). The remaining Coleman holdings and the related Robesonia Iron Company were also sold to Bethlehem Steel, in 1919 and 1926 respectively. Bethlehem Steel continued to mine iron ore at Cornwall until 1973.\n\nIn 1677, John Grubb came from Cornwall, U.K., and settled in Brandywine Hundred, Delaware, where he established a tannery. His son Peter launched iron operations that eventually linked six generations of people, including:\n\nCornwall, Pennsylvania, was the center of the early Grubb Family Iron Dynasty in the 18th century. It later served a similar role for the Coleman Family operations.\n\nThe Grubb family enterprises began when Peter Grubb, a stonemason by training, discovered at Cornwall, Pennsylvania between 1734 and 1737, what proved to be the largest domestic iron ore deposit east of Lake Superior. Grubb purchased 1,000 acres of iron-rich property and began manufacturing activities at the Cornwall Iron Furnace and Hopewell Forges in 1742. The business thrived at Cornwall, operating until 1765 under lease by a group of businessmen named Cury & Company, while Grubb removed to Wilmington, Delaware, where he lived out his life.\n\nPeter's sons Curtis Grubb and Peter Grubb, Jr. inherited the iron works after their father died in 1754, and took over operation in 1765. The ironmaster brothers were both Patriots of the American Revolution and Colonels of local militia; their iron works developed and supplied significant quantities of cannon and other munitions to the war effort. With the heavy demand for iron products and the accompanying inflation during the war, the brothers (and other ironmasters) realized handsome profits in the service of their new country. Curtis added the Union Forge to the holdings about 1782. They continued to operate the iron works, producing several hundred tons annually, Curtis at the Cornwall Furnace and Peter at the Hopewell Forges, until they died, Peter Jr. in 1786 and Curtis in 1789. Their residential mansions at both locations still stand today.\n\nThe Grubb brothers unfortunately had a serious falling out beginning in 1783, when Curtis' pending remarriage spawned inheritance anxieties by his oldest son Peter III, 26, who had been a Captain of the Continental Army and a prisoner of war. Curtis acquiesced and decided to give his son his inheritance before the wedding, which subsequently required the courts to formally partition the family operations and allocate ownership shares among Curtis, Peter Jr., and Peter III.\n\nPeter Jr. retained a 2/3 interest in the Hopewell Forges but only a 1/3 interest in the rest of the holdings (Cornwall Furnace and Ore Banks, and Union Forge). Peter III received the remaining 1/3 interest in the Hopewell Forges, plus a 1/6 interest in the rest. Peter Jr. feared for the future supply of raw pig iron to his Hopewell Forges that was to become his legacy to his sons, so he decided to build his own furnace at a place south of Cornwall he called Mount Hope, where he had purchased 212 acres. The brothers were now in competition and their relations became increasingly acrimonious. Peter III grew concerned for the business and sold his holdings (1/3 share of the Hopewell Forges and 1/6 share of the rest) to a family friend, Robert Coleman, on September 26, 1785, for 8,500 pounds of gold. All of this weighed heavily on Peter Jr., who had gone deeply into debt to build his furnace; the pressures of competing family operations, and his own poor health, led him to take his own life at Hopewell on January 17, 1786.\n\nAfter Curtis' subsequent passing in 1789, none of his heirs were willing or able to manage the operations and there were complex family inheritance and legal issues still to be resolved by the courts. Robert Coleman had worked for the brothers and was in a position to step in as the family became increasingly unable to manage the business. As a result, in 1895 Curtis' remaining heirs sold their 3/6 interest to Coleman, and by 1803 he had acquired the Hopewell Forges and 5/6 of the rest of the original properties. A successful ironmaster and businessman in his own right, Coleman took over the Cornwall operations, acquired other properties, and went on to become Pennsylvania's first millionaire.\n\nIt was fortunate for Peter Jr.'s heirs that he decided to begin iron-making operations at Mount Hope. Since the Colemans were now operating out of Cornwall, Mount Hope was destined to become the headquarters of a new and much larger Grubb family iron business.\n\nMount Hope Estate was the headquarters of the Grubb Family iron manufacturing operations during the 19th Century.\n\nHenry Bates Grubb, building on his father's legacy, founded the 19th-century Grubb family iron empire.\n\nHenry was the youngest of Peter Jr.'s two sons who inherited their father's estate in 1786, well before they came of age. The estate included 3,741 acres of iron-rich Cornwall land, 2/3 interest in the Hopewell Forges, plus 221 acres and their father's new furnace at Mount Hope. Henry, unlike his older brother Alan, was quite interested in the iron business and had several competent advisers whom the brothers had selected as guardians of their estate. He purchased his brother's share in 1798, to be paid over time, and began to rebuild the business, apparently with the cooperation of Robert Coleman. Henry was barely seventeen when he began a series of transactions to rebuild the family iron business, acquiring several properties. The combined operations grew to become one of the largest iron producers in Pennsylvania during the 19th century.\n\nHenry's holdings grew to include at least three iron manufacturing operations, over 6,500 acres of land and a 1/6 interest in the Cornwall ore banks, all managed from Mount Hope. He died in 1823, leaving his widow Harriet Amelia Buckley Grubb to oversee the operations until their sons began to come of age in 1830.\n\nHenry's three sons (Edward Burd Grubb, Clement Brooke Grubb and Alfred Bates Grubb) took over the family business when they came of age beginning in 1830. They greatly expanded the family's operations to become Pennsylvania's leading iron producers from 1840 to 1870, with their headquarters at Mount Hope Estate.\n\nEdward was sent to Europe in 1830 to study the latest iron technology, apparently a worthwhile family investment in the future growth of the business. In 1833 Edward and Clement assumed control of the business under the name E. & C.B. Alfred's involvement probably began when he came of age in 1839.\n\nClement apparently decided to strike out on his own, as he resigned from E. & C.B in 1845 and sold his half interest in the Mount Hope Estate to his younger brother Alfred for $25,000. He moved to Lancaster, where he built a large Greek Revival mansion that is now the Lancaster Museum of Art. About the same time Edward removed with his family to Burlington, NJ, where he became a prominent citizen of that area.\n\nAlfred was left to manage the Mount Hope Estate and Furnace, in partnership with Edward and his heirs, which he continued until at least 1873. After his death in 1885, the Mount Hope Estate was sold back to Clement for $300,000.\n\nClement acquired several operations at other locations, including two newer-technology anthracite furnaces near Columbia, PA, along the Susquehanna River.\n\nEdward and his sons were also active in the iron business during this period. E. Burd entered the business after his Civil War service, and C. Ross entered into a relationship with the Haldeman iron manufacturing family.\n\nGrubb family members owned and/or operated eleven iron manufacturing operations after the Civil War, when iron was in great demand to meet the needs of an expanding country. Old plants were acquired or upgraded and a new one was built. The Cornwall ore banks continued to supply large quantities of ore to both the iron and newer steel industries. But the expansion of ironworks proved to be short-lived, as the transition to steel production was on the horizon.\n\nThe charcoal- and anthracite-based iron manufacturing business rather quickly succumbed to newer technology and the transition to the steel industry that located further west. The ten Grubb family furnaces and mines listed above were shut down over just a 25-year period. Daisy Grubb sold some of her inherited industrial holdings and C. Ross Grubb, as President of the Cornwall Ore Bank Company, sold the Cornwall Iron Mines, both in 1902, to the Pennsylvania Steel Company (later acquired by Bethlehem Steel Company in February, 1916). E. Burd Grubb continued to operate the Lebanon Valley Furnace until about 1911. The dispositions of the other Grubb properties have not been determined, but may have also been acquired by Pennsylvania Steel.\n\nThe final fifth-generation members of the Grubb Family Iron Dynasty generally went into well-funded retirements. Of Clement's heirs, Charles Brooke Grubb died a batchelor at his Lancaster home in 1911; Ella Jane (Grubb) Smith died in 1920; Daisy Grubb renovated the Mount Hope Estate and may have died there in 1936. Of Edward Burd Grubb's heirs, Gen. E. Burd Grubb ran unsuccessfully for Congress in 1908, lost his fortune in a bad investment, and died in Newark in 1913; Henry Bates Grubb died in Burlington in 1919; C. Ross Grubb owned a chateau in Normandy, a villa on the Riviera, and an estate at Manada where he died in 1928. Sixth-generation Parker Ross Grubb died at 45 while golfing in Switzerland in 1920.\n\nThe Cornwall Iron Mines, that had been the source of the family's wealth, continued in production under Bethlehem Steel until operations were ended by a 1973 flood resulting from\nHurricane Agnes; it had been mined continuously for 234 years.\n\nDaisy Elizabeth Brooke Grubb was Clement Grubb's youngest child. Never married, she inherited holdings worth $6 million from her father in 1889 and became a wealthy Lancaster spinster and socialite who lived at Mount Hope Estate and at her father's mansion in downtown Lancaster; she also had a town home in Philadelphia. In 1902, she sold most of her inherited industrial holdings to Pennsylvania Steel Company. In 1895, she began renovating her 12-room Federal-style Mount Hope mansion, enlarging it into a 32-room Victorian mansion where she entertained extensively. She retained the formal gardens established by her grandfather. Grubb was the last family member to live at Mount Hope, where she may have died in 1936. The estate is now privately owned and is listed on the National Register of Historic Places. Her will left a trust fund to the Hope Episcopal Church, which was built by her grandmother, and the rest to descendants of her sisters.\n\nThe following properties were owned and operated over time by members of the Grubb family, or were closely associated with their operations. Presented in the approximate order of their appearance in the family dynasty. The early furnaces were charcoal-fired, and so were located on or near large tracts of hardwood forests that supplied the charcoal. Later furnaces (after about 1845) were fired by anthracite coal and/or coke, and were located near waterways or railroads that could transport the coal-based fuel mined elsewhere. Forges transformed the pig iron, produced by the furnaces, into final products.\n\nThe Cornwall Iron Mines in Lebanon County, also known as the Cornwall Ore Banks, were the foundation of the Grubb Family Iron Dynasty. Discovered by Peter Grubb, who had acquired 1,000 acres by 1737, they proved to be the largest domestic iron ore deposit east of Lake Superior, and were once the largest open pit iron mine in the world. The ore was primarily magnetite. While the majority interest in the mines were gradually acquired by Robert Coleman by 1803, the descendants of Peter Grubb, Jr. retained a 1/6 interest as tenants in common.\n\nThe Cornwall Ore Bank Company was formed in 1864 to operate the mines for the benefit of the owners - by then numbering 96! The company operated the mines until they were sold in 1902 to the Pennsylvania Steel Company, which was later acquired by the Bethlehem Steel Corporation) in February, 1916.\n\nThere was also an open pit mine sold to Bethlehem Steel by the Coleman heirs in 1919.\n\nThe mines produced high quality iron ore and other valuable minerals for 234 years, growing to over a million tons per year, until they were flooded by Hurricane Agnes and then closed permanently in 1973.\n\nLifespan = 1737–1973, 234 years; 1737–1902, 165 years full or partial ownership by Grubb family\nProduction = 776,000 tons by 1848, 358,000 tons/year in 1940, 1.1 million tons/year later.\nAcreage = 1,000 acres in 1737. 10,261 acres in 1786 (6,520 owned by Curtis Grubb & Robert Coleman, 3,741 by Peter Grubb, Jr.'s heirs)\n\nThe Cornwall Furnace in Lebanon County was built by Peter Grubb in 1742 to process ore from his nearby Cornwall Iron Mines and supply pig iron to his Hopewell Forges. A cold blast charcoal fired furnace, it had a reported output capacity of 32 tons per week and supplied pig iron to six local and Philadelphia forges. After Cury & Co.'s 20-year lease expired about 1765, the furnace was jointly owned by Peter's sons Curtis and Peter Jr. Curtis, the majority partner, operated the furnace and Peter ran the Hopewell Forges. The brothers were enthusiastic Patriots and their iron works supplied cannon and other munitions to the Revolutionary War effort during their ownership, which ended with Curtis' death in 1789.\n\nCurtis Grubb's heirs found themselves unable or unwilling to operate the business and in 1795 they sold their interests to Robert Coleman, who had already acquired a partial interest in the business and had been managing it for them. Coleman and his heirs operated Cornwall Furnace, with various improvements over the years, until it was closed down in 1883. It has been preserved in excellent condition and the property was deeded to the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania in 1932 by the Coleman heirs. Cornwall Furnace is now open to the public and is listed on the National Register of Historic Places.\n\nLifespan = 1742–1883, 141 years; 1742–1802, 60 years in Grubb family\nFurnace type = Charcoal cold blast\nOre source = Cornwall Iron Mines\nProduction = 32 ton/wk (max 1,600 ton/year)\nAcreage = 80 acres in 1744\nTransportation = Wagons, Union Canal & N. Lebanon Plank Road (c1820-1886), Cornwall RR (1855 -)\n\nThe Hopewell Forges on Hammer Creek (not to be confused with the Hopewell Furnace National Historic Site), were part of the original Grubb iron works, built by Peter Grubb (the elder) in 1742 to turn pig iron from Cornwall Furnace into final iron products. After 1765, Peter's sons Curtis and Peter Jr. assumed joint ownership of their father's holdings, including the forges. Peter Jr., the minority partner, lived nearby and operated the forges until his death in 1786. See \n\nThe forges, however, became central to a Grubb family tragedy and other unintended consequences. In 1783, Curtis' son Peter III had been given an interest in the family iron works by his father as an advance inheritance. The courts then had to determine how best to partition the overall assets. Peter III was given a 1/6 interest in the ore fields and a 1/3 interest in the forges, making him partners with his uncle Peter. Neither were happy with the arrangement and in 1785 Peter III sold his share of the forges (and the ore fields) to Robert Coleman, who thus became Peter Jr.'s partner. Peter Jr. became even more concerned for his business situation, especially for the supply of pig iron from his brother's Cornwall Furnace, and decided to build his own furnace at Mount Hope. He went deeply into debt and the pressures of the situation led him to commit suicide at Hopewell in 1786.\n\nThese events related to the forges had another unintended consequence. As part of the sale to Coleman, Peter III reserved for himself and his heirs the perpetual right to remove sufficient ore from Cornwall Iron Mines to supply one furnace. This clause, particularly the definition of \"one furnace,\" became an unsettled issue in the courts for nearly 100 years. See \"Robesonia Iron Company\" below.\n\nColeman acquired the remaining interest in the Hopewell Forges in 1802, from Henry Bates Grubb. The property was among those left by Coleman to his four sons upon his death in 1825. While it is unclear when Hopewell ceased operations, it produced 250 tons in 1833, but probably closed before 1854 when Coleman's Speedwell Forge, also on Hammer Creek, was shut down. There is little left of the forges today except a few remnants of the dams at the creek, but Peter Grubb's mansion and historic marker can still be seen on present-day Route 322.\n\nLifespan = 1742 – c. 1850, 108 years; 1742–1802, 60 years in Grubb family\nPig iron source = Cornwall Furnace\nProduction = 250 ton/year in 1833\nAcreage = n/a\n\nUnion Forge was constructed by Curtis Grubb about 1782, near present-day Jonestown, PA, about 12 miles north of Cornwall Furnace. Curtis built the forge to process pig iron from Cornwall Furnace. Included were 1,000 acres of land, blacksmith and carpenter shops, a grist mill, and several houses. The forge continued in operation, under various owners, until 1868, when rolling mills had begun to displace forges as refiners of iron. Union Forge was initially held in common with the rest of the ironworks, and was included in the 1786 partition of the Grubb properties. While unclear, it probably remained a Curtis Grubb operation until his heirs sold to Robert Coleman in 1895. The has been placed at the site of the forge.\n\nLifespan = 1782–1868, 86 years; 1782–1795, 13 years in Grubb family\nPig iron source = Cornwall Furnace\nProduction = Not determined\nAcreage = 1,000\n\nThe charcoal-fired Mount Hope Furnace was built in 1785 by Peter Grubb, Jr., on 212 acres of land he purchased from Jacob Graybill in 1784, in Manheim Township about five miles north of Lancaster. There was already an operating gristmill on the property. Peter went deeply into debt to build the furnace because he feared for the future supply of pig iron for his Hopewell Forges from his brother's Cornwall Furnace, in which Peter had only a minority interest. Peter yielded to the business pressures he found himself under and took his own life at Hopewell in 1786. His sons Alan Burd Grubb and Henry Bates Grubb inherited the furnace, which became a core asset of the future Grubb iron business. The furnace produced 1,000 tons of pig iron in 1833. The furnace was upgraded to hot blast and apparently continued in operation until at least 1885, when it was sold by Alfred Bates Grubb's estate, along with nearly 2,500 acres of land (the Mount Hope Estate), back to his brother Clement Brooke Grubb (who had sold his share to Alfred in 1845) for $300,000.\n\nLifespan = 1785 – c. 1885, 100 years, all in Grubb family\nFurnace type = Charcoal cold blast\nOre source = Cornwall Iron Mines\nProduction = 1,000 ton/year in 1833\nAcreage = 212 in 1785; 2,500 in 1885\n\nThe Mount Hope Estate was the enclave near Manheim that was home and headquarters of the Grubb family iron enterprises after 1800. It grew from Peter Grubb Jr.'s original 212 acres in 1786, home to the Mount Hope Furnace and gristmill, to over 2,500 acres and many buildings by 1885. The original Federal style mansion was built by Peter's son, Henry Bates Grubb, between 1800 and 1805; it was the most formal ironmaster's mansion in the area up to 1850, and featured formal gardens that are still maintained. The enclave at its peak contained nearly 30 outbuildings (including the Hope Church, built in 1848-9), most constructed of locally quarried red sandstone and enclosed by a wall of the same material.\n\nHenry B. Grubb, who had inherited Mount Hope from his father at age 12, passed it on to his two older sons, Edward Burd Grubb and Clement Brooke Grubb, upon his death in 1823. The Estate was managed by Henry's widow, Harriet Amelia Buckley Grubb, until the sons came of age. The brothers partnered to operate the business in 1833, under the name E. & C.B. In 1845 Clement sold his half interest to their younger brother Alfred Bates Grubb for $25,000. After Alfred's death in 1885, his heirs sold Mount Hope Estate back to Clement for $300,000, in the most expensive real estate transaction in Lancaster up to that time.\n\nThe last family member to live at Mount Hope was Clement's daughter Daisy Elizabeth Brooke Grubb, who inherited it from her father along with holdings worth six million dollars. In 1895 she began an extensive renovation and transformed the original 12-room structure into a 32-room Victorian mansion where she entertained many distinguished guests. Daisy lived at Mount Hope at least part of the time until she died in 1936.\n\nThe property was subdivided and mostly sold off by the subsequent owners, but the mansion and some surrounding land was bought by Charles Romito for a winery in 1980 and is listed on the National Register of Historic Places.\n\nLifespan = c1805-1936, 131 years in Grubb family, mansion still in use\nProduction = N/A\nAcreage = 2,500 (including furnace) in 1885\n\nThe Mount Vernon Furnace was the first furnace built by Henry Bates Grubb, in 1800 by most references. A charcoal-fired furnace, it was located near Elizabethtown on Conewago Creek, about 15 miles southwest of Mount Hope. It produced 50 tons of pig iron per week (2,500 tons per year) from Cornwall ore. The property was expanded to over 4,000 acres, and there were also a forge, a gristmill, and a sawmill. After Henry's death in 1823, the operations were continued by his sons Edward Burd Grubb and Charles Bates Grubb, and Edward built a second furnace by the same name in 1831. The iron furnaces fell out of production and were abandoned in 1852.\n\nThe sawmill is still in operation today and the gristmill carried on until 1913. The gristmill was still owned by Grubb & Company in 1875. Its ruins can be seen on the property of the beautiful and historic Conewago Manor Inn and the sawmill can be seen nearby. The original inn was built by Samuel Smith sometime after 1739; Henry Bates Grubb added the majestic stonework structure in 1811 and named it Mount Vernon Estate.\n\nThe Grubb's Mount Vernon Furnace is not to be confused with the similarly named furnace in Fayette County in western Pennsylvania.\n\nLifespan = 1800–1852, 52 years, all in Grubb family \nFurnace type = Two charcoal cold blast\nOre source = Cornwall Iron Mines\nProduction = 50 ton/wk (max 2,500 ton/year)\nAcreage = 4,000\n\nThe Codorus Forge was the new name given to the Hellam Forge that Henry Bates Grubb bought from Thomas Neill in 1802. The forge was located in York County, near the intersection of Codorus Creek with the Susquehanna River, about 30 miles southwest of Mount Hope.\n\nThe forge, which had passed through several owners, was originally built around 1765 by William Bennett on 150 acres obtained from William Penn. The forge processed pig iron produced at nearby Mary Ann Furnace, and had supplied cannon and shot to the Continental Army, probably under the ownership of James Smith, a signer of the Declaration of Independence.\n\nHenry Grubb operated the forge until he hired John Shippen, who managed it from 1818 until 1825. Henry's widow, Harriet Amelia Buckley Grubb, oversaw its operation until their oldest sons, Edward Burd Grubb and Clement Brooke Grubb, came of age. The sons inherited the forge and began operating it in 1833 under their partnership E. & C.B. They added the about 1837, transporting ore from their Chestnut Hills Mines by flat boat across the Susquehanna River. The iron products were shipped downriver to Philadelphia and Baltimore. The furnace and forge were closed sometime in the 1850s.\n\nAn iron ore deposit, known as Grubb's Bank (see below), was discovered on the Codorus property in 1866, well after the forge and furnace were closed down. The ore was shipped by river to the St. Charles Furnace in Columbia.\n\nLifespan = 1765 – c. 1855, 90 years; 1802 – c. 1855, 53 years in Grubb family\nFurnace type = Charcoal cold blast\nOre source = Chestnut Hills Mines\nProduction = 400 tons/year (forge)\nAcreage = 150\n\nIn 1803 Henry Bates Grubb purchased land from Gen. Timothy Green, on Manada Creek in the northwest part of East Hanover Township in Dauphin County, about 60 miles east of Mount Hope. Manada Furnace was built in 1836 by Henry's sons Clement B. & Edward B. Grubb, at Sand Beach near the site of the old Manada Fort. Embracing some 2,500 acres, Manada Furnace was the only charcoal furnace in Dauphin County in 1856, a year after the brothers' partnership ended.\n\nThe ore came from the Grubb's Chestnut Hill mine or from the Cornwall mines via the Union Canal to Lebanon. From there it was brought by wagon to the furnace. Water power from Manada Creek turned a wheel which operated the bellows that pumped air into the furnace. The water wheel was probably on the northeast corner of the furnace. A bridge from a hill led to the top of the furnace. Men dumped wheelbarrow loads of charcoal, limestone and iron ore into the top. The furnace produced pig iron and also did some casting of products. From 1837 to 1848 the furnace produced over 22,000 tons of iron. The metal was sent to the Swatara railroad station for transport.\n\nThe community surrounding the furnace consisted of a general store, the iron master's house, a smoke house, boarding house, and twenty two log cabins. The church is still in existence as the United Christian Episcopal Manada Furnace Church. At the peak of operations, the furnace employed 75 men. Two hundred acres were used for farming for the families of furnace workers. In September 1861 the furnace workers formed the 46th Regiment, D Company to fight in the Civil War. The company was disbanded on July 16, 1865. During the Civil War, the owners of Manada Furnace were able to use Confederate prisoners from Camp Curtin to work as woodcutters and laborers. Many are buried at \n\nManada Furnace was closed in 1875.\n\nLifespan = 1836–1875, 39 years, all in Grubb family\nFurnace type = Charcoal hot blast\nOre source = Cornwall Iron Mines and/or Chestnut Hill Mines\nProduction = 2,000 ton/year (1837–1848)\nAcreage = 2,500\n\nA partnership formed in 1833 by Henry's sons Edward Burd Grubb and Clement Brooke Grubb to run the family business from Mount Hope Estate. The partnership continued until 1845 when Clement sold his share to his younger brother Alfred Bates Grubb. By then, Edward had removed to Burlington, NJ and Clement to Lancaster, PA. The companies and properties listed below involved only Clement and Edward and their heirs, as Alfred's did not join the family iron business.\n\nA partnership formed in 1845 between Henry's sons Edward Burd Grubb, Sr. and Alfred Bates Grubb to manage Mt. Hope Estate and Furnace after their brother Clement ended his partnership with Edward. After Edward's death in 1867, Alfred carried on, with Edward's heirs, until 1873.\n\nThe Chestnut Hill Ore Bank, acquired by Clement Brooke Grubb by 1851, was about eight miles west of Lancaster, at Silver Spring near Columbia. The several ore properties at Chestnut Hill, which adjoin each other, were, when taken as a whole, one of the largest hematite ore deposits in Pennsylvania. Ore was first discovered on the Greider farm, between 1825 and 1832, by the engineer Simeon Guilford. Most of the furnaces in and around Columbia and Chickies depended on these mines for their principal supply of ore.\n\nThe Grubb tract, about 13 acres, was developed by Jerome Boyer around 1839 and acquired and further developed by Clement Brooke Grubb sometime prior to 1851, when the Chestnut Hill Iron Ore Company was incorporated. Various tracts at Chestnut Hill were owned, in 1869, by Clement Brooke Grubb, heirs of his brother Edward Burd Grubb, Sr., the Chestnut Hill Iron Ore Company, the Silver Spring Iron Ore Company, and other owners of small outcroppings. In 1904, the property was owned by Clement's son, Charles Brooke Grubb. The ore bank supplied thousands of tons of iron ore to the Grubb's Codorus and Manada furnaces and to other nearby anthracite furnaces, such as the St. Charles Furnaces, until 1907.\n\nThe ore pit, about 13 acres and 110 feet deep, has since filled with water, creating , part of a modern-day 54 acre recreational area in Silver Spring, Pennsylvania.\n\nLifespan = 1839 – c. 1907, 68 years; 1851–1907, 56 years in Grubb family\nProduction = Estimated 20,000 tons/year 1832–1876\nAcreage = 13\n\nThe Grubb Family Papers, 1814–1869, mention a Columbia Furnace 1853 - 1860. These sources have not been reviewed and no other references to a furnace by that name have been found. They likely relate to the Grubb-owned St. Charles Furnace in Columbia.\n\nClement Brooke Grubb built the in 1854, at Columbia near the Susquehanna River about 12 miles west of Lancaster, on the Pennsylvania Railroad. Years later, in 1875, Grubb and his son Charles bought the Henry Clay Furnace, about a mile upriver, and renamed it St. Charles No. 2. Both furnaces were fired by anthracite coal. Together, these two furnaces had an annual capacity of over 20,000 tons of pig iron, which was well known for its quality for boiler plate, bars, nails and foundry work. In 1863 Grubb built a large iron ore roaster, the first of its kind in Lancaster County, to remove sulfur from the local ores used in the furnaces. The St Charles Furnace was remodeled in 1879–80, but only six years later in 1886 it went out of blast for the last time. It was dismantled in 1897; some remains can be seen from the Route 30 bridge.\n\nLifespan = 1854 – c. 1886, 32 years, all in Grubb family\nFurnace type = Anthracite hot blast\nOre source = Local ore & Codorus Iron Mine\nProduction = Estimated 10,000 ton/year\nAcreage = N/A\nTransportation = Pennsylvania Canal, Pennsylvania RR\n\nC.B. Grubb and Son was a partnership formed about 1872 between Clement Brooke Grubb and his son Charles Brooke Grubb. It presumably endured until Clement's death in 1889. The partnership owned both St. Charles Furnaces and the Codorus Iron Mine, also known as Grubb's Bank. They likely also had an interest in the Chestnut Hill Ore Banks, since they were owned by Charles in 1904.\n\nIn 1875 C.B. Grubb and Son (Clement and Charles) bought the , located about a mile up the Susquehanna River from Clement's St. Charles Furnace, on the Pennsylvania Canal and the Pennsylvania Railroad. They renamed it St. Charles No. 2.\n\nThe Henry Clay furnace was one of the first of the anthracite-fired furnaces along the Susquehanna between Columbia and Marietta. It was built in 1845 by Peter Haldeman, but changed hands several times after 1855, producing only sporadically until 1865 when, after a long period of idleness it was blown in again under the proprietorship of the firm Denney and Hess. In 1875 Clement and Charles purchased and renamed it St. Charles Furnace No. 2. Together, the two St. Charles furnaces had an annual capacity of over 20,000 tons of pig iron. The furnace was remodeled in 1879, 1880 and again in 1887, but its production declined and it was abandoned in 1889. Ruins of the onsite tenement building can still be seen today.\n\nLifespan = 1845 – c. 1889, 44 years; 1875–1889, 14 years in Grubb family\nFurnace type = Anthracite hot blast\nOre source = Local ore & Codorus Iron Mine\nProduction = Estimated 10,000 ton/year\nAcreage = N/A\nTransportation = Pennsylvania Canal (1845 -), Pennsylvania RR (1850 -)\n\nThe Codorus Iron Mine, better known in later years as Grubb's Bank, was discovered on the Codorus property in 1866. The owner in 1874 was C. B. Grubb and Son. Since the Codorus Furnace was by then shut down, the ore was hauled to the Susquehanna River and floated to the St. Charles Furnaces in Columbia. The mine, less than an acre in size, contained ore consisting of a mixture of magnetite and hematite in sandstone. About 25,000 tons were removed by 1874, with seven men typically working to take about 25 tons per day.\n\nLifespan = 1866 – c. 1874, 8 years, all in Grubb family\nProduction = Estimated 3,000 ton/year\nAcreage = One\nTransportation = Susquehanna River\n\nThe Haldeman family were prominent iron manufacturers in the Chickies area in Lancaster County. The Grubbs and Haldemans formed several business relationships, beginning in 1869, to own and operate three anthracite furnaces.\n\nIn 1869, heirs of Edward B. Grubb Sr. joined the firm of E. Haldeman & Company, after its founder retired. Those heirs apparently were Henry Bates Grubb and his brother C. Ross Grubb, both of whom became officers in other Grubb/Haldeman companies. C. Ross Grubb had purchased the Eagle Furnace, and the Chickies Iron Company was formed in 1876.\n\nBy 1882, Paris Haldeman, Henry Bates Grubb, and Horace Haldeman had formed the Conewago Iron Company, owners of the Conewago Furnace in Dauphin County. This relationship continued until at least 1892, by which time C. Ross Grubb had succeeded Paris Haldeman as President. The furnace under their ownership supplied the Chickies Iron Company exclusively, but went out of blast in 1888.\n\nIn 1888, the firm of Haldeman, Grubb & Company was formed as a partnership, between Paris Haldeman, C. Ross Grubb, and Horace L. Haldeman. Horace was the managing partner, and Paris retired in 1891. The firm owned Chickies Furnace #1 (formerly the Chickies Furnace, that had been built and owned by the Haldemans) and Chickies Furnace #2 (previously the Eagle Furnace, that had been acquired by Grubb in 1869).\n\nThe anthracite-fired (later renamed Chickies Furnace #2), was built in 1854 on the floodplain between Marietta and Columbia just north of Chickies Creek by Stephen Eagle. Eagle operated the furnace until 1869, when it was purchased by C. Ross Grubb, son and heir of Edward Burd Grubb, Sr. and brother of E. Burd Grubb, Jr. He later became associated with E. Haldeman and Company, who owned and operated the Chickies Furnace. The Haldeman company managed the furnace, remodeled it several times and changed the name to Chickies #2. Haldeman, Grubb & Co. was formed in 1888 to take ownership of Chickies #2 and the nearby Chickies #1. The principal ores used at both Chickies furnaces were obtained from the Grubb and Haldeman's Chestnut Hill ore mines at Silver Springs, some six miles from the furnaces, and from Cornwall, Lebanon County. In the late 1880s the furnace was extensively rebuilt, a two-story engine house was added, and the furnace operated successfully until it was shut down in 1899. Remnants of the furnace, including the still-occupied engine house, can be seen today.\n\nLifespan = 1854 – c. 1899, 45 years; 1869–1899, 30 years in Grubb family\nFurnace type = Anthracite hot blast\nOre source = Chestnut Hill & Cornwall Iron Mines\nProduction = Not determined\nAcreage = N/A\nTransportation = Rail\n\nThe Conewago Furnace, formerly the Middletown Furnace, was in Middletown, Dauphin County. The furnace, built in 1853 and rebuilt in 1879, was owned in 1882 by the Conewago Iron Company, a Grubb and Haldeman partnership. Paris Haldeman was President, Henry Bates Grubb was Vice-President, and Horace Haldeman was Treasurer. It was fueled by anthracite and coke, and the ores were from Cornwall and Chestnut Hill. The product was \"Chickies\" pig iron, made exclusively by contract for the Chickies Iron Company. The Conewago Furnace went out of blast in 1888.\n\nLifespan = 1853–1888, 35 years; c1882-1888, c6 years in Grubb family\nFurnace type = Anthracite and coke hot blast\nOre source = Chestnut Hill & Cornwall Iron Mines\nProduction = Not determined\nAcreage = N/A\n\nHenry Haldeman built the first near the base of Chickies Rock, in Lancaster County, in 1845. Haldeman's sons Edwin and Samuel took over his business holdings later that same year and brought the anthracite-fired furnace into blast in 1846. The furnace was rarely out of blast and with several remodellings to implement technological advancements, it produced 17,000 tons of pig iron per year by the late 19th century. In 1888, Paris and Horace Haldeman partnered with C. Ross Grubb, who owned the nearby Eagle Furnace, to form Haldeman, Grubb and Company. They renamed the furnace Chickies #1 and renamed Eagle Furnace Chickies #2; operating both furnaces until they were shut down in 1899. The principal ores used at the Chickies furnaces were obtained from the Grubb and Haldeman's Chestnut Hill ore mines at Silver Springs, some six miles from the furnaces, and from Cornwall, Lebanon County.\n\nLifespan = 1845 – c. 1899, 54 years; 1888–1889, 11 years in Grubb family\nFurnace type = Anthracite hot blast\nOre source = Chestnut Hill & Cornwall Iron Mines\nProduction = 17,000 ton/year\nAcreage = N/A\nTransportation = Rail\n\nThe Lebanon Valley Furnace Company was formed in 1865 by Edward Burd Grubb, Sr. as the first president. His eldest son, Gen. E. Burd Grubb, Jr., became president after his father's death in 1867. In 1902 the company formally acquired, from Gen. Grubb, both the Lebanon Valley Furnace and his interest in the Cornwall Iron Mines. The company still owned and operated the furnace in 1907.\n\nE. Burd Grubb may have been the last Grubb family member to retire from the iron business, probably in 1911 when he lost his fortune in a bad investment.\n\nThe Lebanon Valley Furnace, in Lebanon, PA, was built in 1865-7, probably by the Lebanon Valley Furnace Company, who formally acquired it from Gen. E. Burd Grubb in 1902. Gen. E. Burd Grubb had become the owner when his father died, shortly before the furnace was blown for the first time in 1867. The furnace was a modern anthracite- and coke-fired furnace that was remodeled in 1884 and rebuilt in 1904, producing an output of pig iron, under the \"Lebanon Valley\" brand, of 24,000 tons per year. It was still active in 1907 and most likely continued under Grubb's control until 1911.\n\nLifespan = 1867-unk; 1867 – c. 1911, 44 years in Grubb family\nFurnace type = Anthracite and coke, hot blast\nOre source = Cornwall Iron Mines\nProduction = Estimated 24,000 ton/year\nAcreage = N/A\nTransportation = Probably rail\n\nThe Grubbs were minority partners in the Cornwall Ore Bank Company, as they continued to hold a 1/6 interest in the ore banks. The company was formed in 1864 to operate the Cornwall mines for the benefit of the owners - by then numbering 96 tenants in common! The company operated the mines until they were sold in 1902 to the Pennsylvania Steel Company, which was itself acquired by the Bethlehem Steel Corporation in February, 1916. The President of the Cornwall Ore Bank Company when the mines were sold was C. Ross Grubb, representing the Grubb family's fifth generation in the iron business.\n\nWhile not formally a Grubb property, the charcoal-fired was owned by Clement Grubb's son-in-law, L. Heber Smith, a Civil War Colonel who married Clement's daughter Ella Jane Brooke Grubb in 1868. Located in Berks County, the furnace was built in 1792 and named for Joanna Potts, wife of the principal owner. It passed through several hands before Smith took ownership, probably after the war and before his marriage to Ella Jane. It is not unreasonable to assume that the Grubbs assisted with the furnace's major technological upgrade in 1889, especially since Ella Jane would have been an heiress to her father's sizable estate that year. The furnace continued in operation under Smith until it was \"blown out\" after his death in 1898 at the age of 61. The furnace was acquired by Bethlehem Steel, who deeded it to the Hay Creek Valley Historical Association in 1979; the ruins have been enhanced by local historians and are open to visitors.\n\nLifespan = 1792–1898, 106 years; 1868–1898, 30 years in Smith/Grubb family\nFurnace type = Charcoal cold blast\nOre source = Jones Mine\nProduction = Not determined\nAcreage = Not determined\n\nWhile the Robesonia Iron Company, owners of the at Robesonia in Berks County about 20 miles east of Cornwall, was not a Grubb property, it affected the affairs of the Grubbs and Colemans for most of the 19th century because it owned access rights to Cornwall iron ore.\n\nAfter Curtis Grubb's oldest son Peter Grubb III received his inheritance in 1783, he sold his 1/3 interest in the Hopewell Forges to Robert Coleman. But as a condition of that sale Peter reserved for himself and his heirs the right of access to remove \"for as long as grass grows and water flows\" sufficient ore to supply \"one furnace\". Peter later, in 1883, sold his remaining share of the iron mines, along with these rights, to George Ege to supply his Reading Furnace in Berks County.\n\nHenry P. Robeson acquired the operation in 1845 and with it the right to access Cornwall iron ore. Robeson replaced the charcoal-fired Reading Furnace with two (in 1848 and 1855) more modern and much larger Robesonia Anthracite Furnaces, while still demanding the right to access Cornwall iron ore – to supply one furnace, whichever one of the two was in operation, but not both at once. The combined capacity was many times greater than had been visualized in 1783. That right of access, especially with the interpretation of the quantities of ore permitted for \"one furnace\", was a highly contentious issue for years between Robeson and the Grubbs and Colemans, who jointly owned the ore banks as tenants in common. The issue languished in the courts for years and was not resolved until the state Supreme Court ruled in Robesonia's favor in 1880. As a result, in 1884, the company decided to market only one kind of pig iron called \"Robesonia\", made exclusively from Cornwall ore, which was consumed in large quantities.\n\nIn 1926, the Bethlehem Steel Company, owners of the Cornwall iron mines since 1916, acquired Robesonia. In order to protect the mines from the enormous amounts of ore being consumed, Bethlehem Steel elected to shut down the Robesonia furnaces in 1927.\n\nLifespan = 1848–1927, 79 years (anthracite furnaces)\nFurnace type = Two anthracite hot blast furnaces\nOre source = Cornwall Iron Mines\nProduction = Grew from 52 ton/wk in 1848 to 240 ton/wk in 1854 to 1,000 ton/wk (52,000 ton/yr) in 1884\nAcreage = 6-7,000\n"}

He is an Assistant Professor of Pediatrics at the Keck School of Medicine at the University of Southern California and a fellow of the American Academy of Pediatrics. Karp lives in Los Angeles with his wife Nina Montee Karp.\n\nKarp is best known for his techniques for calming infants and promoting sleep. He is the author of a series of books and DVDs on parenting.\n\nFrom 1982 to 1984 Karp practiced pediatrics with pediatrician Paul Fleiss in Los Angeles, California. He then opened his own practice in Santa Monica, where he continued to see patients until 2005. He was assistant clinical professor of pediatrics at the UCLA School of Medicine from 1989 to 2009, where he served as pediatric liaison to the Child Abuse Team. He appeared as a regular contributor to the Lifetime cable television show \"Growing Up Together\" from 1990 to 1992. In 2009, he became an assistant professor of pediatrics at the USC Keck School of Medicine.\n\nKarp is a founding board member of Healthy Child Healthy World, and has served on the advisory boards of the Green Guide, Babycenter.com, \"Parents\", \"Ser Padres,\" and \"American Baby\" magazines.\n\nMost recently, Karp has collaborated with Yves Béhar to develop a \"smart\" bassinet. Karp claims that it is able to calm fussing babies.\n\nKarp’s infant calming technique is supposed to be based on recreating the essential elements of the experience of living in the womb. Human babies, according to Karp, are born less developed than other mammals. Karp calls the first three months of life the \"fourth trimester.\" Karp hypothesizes that all babies are born with a \"calming reflex\" that quickly relaxes most fussy babies when they are stimulated in a way that resemble sensations that babies experience in the womb. His method for soothing crying babies, the so-called 5 S's, includes swaddling, side/stomach position, shushing, swinging and sucking.\n\nRegarding sleep, Karp recommends nightly swaddling and sound and motion sleep cues to help babies establish a circadian rhythm and to promote infant sleep.\n\nCBS news reports that \"Critics say Karp is riding to fame on the strength of his patients' VIP parents, who include Michelle Pfeiffer, Pierce Brosnan and Madonna. Endorsements from several stars appear on his book jacket and video cover.\"\n\nSome doctors have also expressed concern that babies may accidentally be left to sleep face down, a position which increases the risk of sudden infant death syndrome. Karp explicitly warns parents not to leave babies in this position.\n\nRalph Frenken has argued against Karp’s recommendation of the use of tight swaddling and the concept of a \"calming reflex.\" The criticism is that the effect of swaddling is not based on reflexes because (1) a releasing stimulus is missing, because swaddling most probably works by the decrease of proprioceptive and tactile stimulation and (2) the reflex response is missing, because any reflex always consists of a movement released by muscles. The child does not move but falls asleep by swaddling. Additionally, no known reflex alters the state of consciousness, but swaddling obviously does. Lactation and breastfeeding expert, Nancy Mohrbacher, collected several scientific studies which demonstrated negative aspects of swaddling on newborn infants.\n\nIn 2010, researchers studied the effects of video instruction concerning swaddling, side positioning, white noise, jiggling, and sucking on parents' ability to calm fussing babies. The results against a control group were statistically insignificant compared to traditional methods. Other than that, no aspect of Karp's calming techniques concerning the psychological or physical consequences on babies has been discussed by the scientific community.\n"}

The project sought to create a standard for document interchange that would allow the publishing industry to reap the benefits of descriptive markup, which was seen as “the most effective means of establishing a consistent method for preparing electronic manuscripts which can feed the publishing process.”. Key participants in the project included organizations such as the US Library of Congress, the American Society of Indexers, the IEEE, the American Chemical Society, the American Institute of Physics, and the American Mathematical Society.\n\nIn 1983, Aspen Systems Corporation was hired to conduct the work over a two-year period. Two preliminary works with restricted distribution were produced in 1985, the draft AAP DTD and author guidelines.\n\nIn 1986, the Electronic Publishing Special Interest Group (EPSIG), a consortium sponsored by the Online Computer Library Center (OCLC), recommended the DTDs developed by the Electronic Manuscript Project be used as an American Standard. With the support of the AAP and the Graphic Communications Association (GCA), the recommendations were accepted and, in 1988, the AAP DTD became the American National Standards Institute's \"Electronic Manuscript Preparation and Markup\" (ANSI/NISO Z39.59) standard. Being based on the ASCII character encoding standard, it includes a large set of entity definitions for special characters.\n\nThe AAP and EPSIG continued their collaboration and published a revised version of the specification in 1989, identifying three document types in the field of publishing: Book, Serial Publication, and Article, for each of which the revised specification offers a DTD.\n\nThe AAP and the European Physical Society (EPS) further collaborated on a standard method for marking up tables and mathematical notation in scientific documents.

This technology underwent a long process of development. The early concept of central inlet of the heat carrier was later replaced by a concept of heat carrier gas cross flow in the retort.\n\nThe Kiviter technology has been used in Estonia since 1921, when first experimental Kiviter retorts were built. The first commercial scale oil plant based on the Kiviter technology was built in 1924.\n\nFrom 1955 to 2003, Kiviter technology was used for oil shale processing also in Slantsy, Russia.\n\nThe Kiviter process is classified as an internal combustion technology. The Kiviter retort is a vertical cylindrical vessel that heats coarse oil shale with recycled gases, steam, and air. To supply heat, gases (including produced oil shale gas) and carbonaceous spent residue are burnt within the retort. Raw oil shale is fed into the top of the retort, and is heated by the rising gases, which pass laterally through the descending oil shale causing decomposition of the rock. Pyrolysis is completed in the lower section of the retort, where the spent shale contacted with more hot gas, steam and air is heated to about to gasify and burn the residual carbon (char). Shale oil vapors and evolving gases are delivered to a condensing system, where condensed shale oil is collected, while non-condensable gases are fed back to the retort. Recycled gas enters the bottom of the retort and cools the spent shale, which then leaves the retort through a water-sealed discharge system.\n\nThe Kiviter process uses large amounts of water, which is polluted during processing, and the solid waste residue contains water-soluble toxic substances that leach into the surrounding area.\n\nThe Kiviter process is used by the Estonian Viru Keemia Grupp's subsidiary VKG Oil. The company operates several Kiviter retorts, the largest of them having a processing capacity of 40 tonnes per hour of oil shale feedstock.\n\n"}

It is a mottled texture, more intense than a simple flat finish, but less intense than orange peel, or popcorn, texture.\n\nKnockdown texture is created by watering down joint compound to a soupy consistency. A trowel is then used to apply the joint compound. The joint compound will begin to form stalactites as it dries. The trowel is then run over the surface of the drywall, knocking off the stalactites and leaving the mottled finish.\n\nA much more common, and faster technique is to apply the texture mud (which is slightly different from joint compound, in that it has less shrinkage upon drying) with a texture machine – a compressor which sprays mud instead of paint. This applies what is referred to as a splatter coat. The use of a compressor allows this to be applied to walls as well as ceilings. When knocking this down, the mud is allowed to dry for a short period, then skimmed with a knockdown knife – a large, usually plastic (to reduce noticeable edges) knife.\n\nKnockdown texture reduces construction costs because it conceals imperfections in the drywall that normally require higher more expensive stages of sand and prime for drywall installers.\n"}

It depicts a starting rocket that rises on its exhaust plume. The monument is 107 meters (351 feet) tall, has 77° incline, and is made of titanium. The Memorial Museum of Cosmonautics is located inside the base of the monument.\n\nThe monument is located outside the main entry to today's Exhibition of Achievements of the National Economy (\"VDNKh\"), in the northeastern part of Moscow, near Prospekt Mira (\"Peace Avenue\"). The easiest access is from the VDNKh subway station.\n\nSince the 1960s, this part of Moscow in general has had a high concentration of space-themed sights and names: besides the monument and the museum under it, the grand \"Cosmos\" pavilion in the Exhibition Centre displayed many artifacts of the Soviet space program. Many streets in the area have been named after the precursors of the space program (Nikolai Kibalchich, Friedrich Zander, Yuri Kondratyuk) and its participants (Sergey Korolyov).\n\nThe Cosmonauts Alley south of the monument features busts of Soviet cosmonauts.\n\nThe choice of this part of Moscow for space-related names and monuments may have been inspired by the fact that Prospekt Mira runs toward the north-eastern suburbs of Moscow, where, in Podlipki\n(today's Korolyov City) much of the space program was based. Korolyov himself lived in a house within a few blocks from the monument, which is now preserved as Korolyov Memorial Museum ().\n\nIn March 1958, a few months after the launch of \"Sputnik 1\", a competition was announced for the best design of an obelisk celebrating the dawn of the Space Age. Out of some 350 proposals, the design by sculptor A.P. Faidysh-Krandievsky and architects A.N. Kolchin and M.O. Barshch was chosen. The grand opening of the monument took place on October 4, 1964, on the day of the 7th anniversary of the \"Sputnik 1\" launch.\n\nThe monument was designed to accommodate a museum in its base. However, it took until April 10, 1981 (two days before the 20th anniversary of Yuri Gagarin's flight) to complete the\npreparatory work and open the Memorial Museum of Cosmonautics. The museum reopened on April 12, 2009 after three years of renovations.\n\nThe main part of the monument is a giant obelisk topped by a rocket and resembling in shape the exhaust plume of the rocket. It is 107 meters (350 feet) tall and, on Korolyov's suggestion, covered with titanium cladding.\n\nA statue of Konstantin Tsiolkovsky, the precursor of astronautics, is located in front of the obelisk.\n\nA poem in Russian on the front of the stone base of the monument base says:\nApproximate translation:\nBelow, in smaller letters, is the dedicatory statement:\n\"В ознаменование выдающихся достижений советского народа в освоении космического пространства сооружен этот монумент\" (\"This monument was constructed to celebrate the outstanding achievements of the Soviet people in space exploration\"), and the year, 1964.\n\nBoth sides of the monument base, in their front parts, are decorated with haut- and bas-reliefs depicting men and women of the space program: \nscientists, engineers, workers, their occupations indicated by appropriate accoutrements of the professions. Notable figures include a computer programmer (or perhaps some other computing or telecommunications professional) holding a punched tape, a cosmonaut wearing a space suit, and Laika the space dog, first animal to orbit Earth.\n\nNo contemporary Soviet politicians are depicted in the monument either (that would violate the convention existing in the post-Joseph Stalin Soviet Union against commemorating living persons in this fashion), but the crowd on the right side of the monument are moving forward under the banner of Vladimir Lenin.\n\nThe \"Monument to the Conquerors of Space\" is featured on the 1967 ten-kopeck piece, one of the series of the commemorative coins issued to celebrate the 50th anniversary of the October Revolution. This coin has the distinction of being the smallest-denomination commemorative coin ever minted in the Soviet Union. (It was the smallest coin in the 1967 series—the only time commemorative fractional currency coins were ever produced in the USSR. All later commemorative coins were either 1 ruble, or a higher denomination).\nThe Monument is also featured in the music video \"Go West\" by Pet Shop Boys.\n\nAlso monument featured in the music video \"Sweet Lullaby\" by Deep Forest.\n\nThe monument is depicted on the home kit for the Russia national football team for the 2014 FIFA World Cup on the front of the shirts in different shades of maroon.\n\nThe monument to Konstantin Tsiolkovsky in downtown Borovsk, designed by Sergey Bychkov, contains a nearly exact scale replica of the \"Conquerors of Space\" \"rocket needle\" and a whimsical statue of Tsiolkovsky gazing into the skies (and wearing valenki boots). It was unveiled in 2007. A copy of this statue (but not the \"rocket needle\") is installed at the Sir Thomas Brisbane Planetarium. A copy is also exhibited in the park of the United Nations Office in Geneva, a gift donated by the USSR and designed by the architect Alexander Koltchin and sculptor Yuri Neroda.\n\n\n"}

She lives and works in Düsseldorf.\n\nMyriam Thyes was born in Luxembourg and grew up in Zürich. After getting certificate of higher education entrance, she studied at Hoehere Schule für Gestaltung Zurich, now ZHdK Zurich University of the Arts, Switzerland. 1986 to 1992, the artist studied at the Academy of Fine Arts Düsseldorf, Kunstakademie Düsseldorf, painting with Professor Rissa, and video art with Professor Nan Hoover. She received a degree 'Meisterschueler' from Kunstakademie Düsseldorf. Since 1994, Thyes participates in exhibitions and festivals internationally.\n\nSince 1999, main artistic media of Myriam Thyes are video art, 2D computer animation, photography, and digital imagery. From beginning of 2000 she initiates and realizes as well participatory projects and media art projects in public space. She co-founded artist group Strictly Public who were invited to participate at Berlin media art festival transmediale.04. Already in 2000 and 2001, Strictly Public showed video art at 9 metro stations in North Rhine-Westphalia (Germany), and 2002 in 26 main stations of the federal railroad all over Germany. Among Thyes's video art works in these programs was 'A little Meditation', the animation of the yin yang symbol, shown for example on the big screen at Frankfurt/Main central station.\n\nLA Freewaves: Video art could be seen on monitors in stores and on billboards on Sunset Boulevard at the then new media festival 2004 in Los Angeles under artistic director Anne Bray. Cathrien Schreuder: \"Myriam Thyes's work A Little Meditation on Sunset Boulevard in Hollywood is a good example. In order to maintain its own form, her animated yin-yang symbol 'fights against the influences of commerce, and in doing so wrests a place for itself in the streetscape. Employing a universal idiom, Thyes visualizes the imbalance within the force field of oublic space. (...) The fact that the work is a good supplement to the streetscape on which it has been shown, including the screens in the train stations of Düsseldorf, the Victory Park Screens in Dallas and various screens in Bern, Bosnia, Melbourne, Manchester and Dublin.\" \n\nThyes' themes deal with symbols, myths and visual signs from architecture, politics, movies, and religions, but as well mythical characters from Hollywood movies, and female characters form different cultures and epochs.\n\nThyes is represented by the media art foundation 'Imai – inter media art institute' (Germany) and videokunst.ch (Switzerland).\nShe is member of Deutscher Künstlerbund (visual artists association, Germany) and Visarte (visual artists association, Switzerland).\n\nOne of her best known works – frequently shown in exhibitions and festivals internationally – is the participatory animation project Flag Metamorphoses. She started in 2005 a continuously growing series of Flash animations concerning flags, other national symbols, and relations between countries. It's a work about relations between nations and identities: each artist who creates a flag animation expresses such a relation in his or her own way. So far, the series contains 40 animations by 30 international artists and teams. All animations together include about 100 different nations. Professor Paul Wells about Flag Metamorphoses in his book \"Re-Imagining Animation\": \"Thyes's work is a very particular response to what she describes a very human 'double wish' to have both an individual identity and yet belong to a bigger group, often represented through nations, which are themselves 'imagined communities'. On her choice of flags as iconic Stimuli, Thyes recognises that their symbolism often endures beyond the actual conditions a nation lives through, sometimes remaining largely aspirational (...) Working in such a direct and politicised way, Thyes saw the opportunity to embrace both a democratic approach to the creation of work responsive to a core theme while engaging with other artists, but also in relation to its dissemination to a global audience on the World Wide Web. (...) Inevitably, this level of engagement prompts differing approaches and levels of interrogation. The political level looks at relationships between neighbouring countries, colonial ties and cultural imperialism. On the other hand, the artistic level examines the collapse and revision of largely geometric forms into more amorphous, organic and fluid configurations. (...) Thyes recognised that the key concept of changing cultures was readily revealed through the use of animation's core language of metamorphosis, and in the way animation could reveal and yet challenge the dense meanings embedded in national image systems. (...) Conceptually, Thyes felt that the best results might be achieved if the metamorphoses themselves took place within a single frame: 'What I have in mind is generally one changing image, not a film with scenes and cuts.' (...) This use of the formalist limits of the frame, while addressing the conditions of transition and meaning within it, reflects Thyes's background and identity as a visual artist. The particular influence of Russian Constructivism and the work of the Bauhaus movement are reflected in her collage technique and political satire.\" \nIn the 1990s, she had worked with real flags as installations in public areas: She created and painted new designs and symbols on flags and hung them beside and between official flags in Dusseldorf and Luxembourg.\n\nThyes participated in the \"Art Colony Galichnik\" in Macedonia in Summer 2010. Artists and curators from various Balkan countries worked together. Thyes asked her subjects to answer in their mother tongues (Serbian/Croatian/Bosnian, Macedonian, Bulgarian and Albanian) and then subtitled their replies into English. She created a collage of images and voices in a two-channel video installation, called From Art Colony Galichnik with love (Macedonia 2010). \"Thyes documents the thoughts of her subjects and combines their words with shots of the countryside. She creates a sensitive picture of the different personalities and characters, partly by matching the two sets of images. The shots of landscapes and towns depict the origins of the person speaking or emphasise the content of what is being said. Thyes, who has Swiss and Luxembourgian roots, puts the individual at the heart of her work. In doing so, she teils a story of the human needs that exist together at a specific point and place in time - and that, ultimately, reflect the needs that people experience at any time and anywhere in the world.\" \n\nThe series of photos and photomontages Glasgow Styles reflect the artist's impressions of the post-industrial city of Glasgow and her inhabitants. Thyes has drawn a social portrait and created a kind of contemporary \"Historienbilder\" (historical paintings). Michael Staab in \"The Whole Picture. Second Take\" about this work: \"... Now, in her series entitled Glasgow Styles, Myriam Thyes takes the consistent next step, and combines the realistic, serial and documentary potential of photography with the formative, allegorising and metaphor-creating traditions of the fine arts. She compiles individual snapshots into sequences that make lapses of time and changes of perspective visible, and also mounts photographs taken at geographically differing locations and at staggered points in time into altogether new pictorial inventions. The citizens of Glasgow, some of them mounted into the original pictures, happened to be at other locations in the same town at the time the pictures were taken. Thus the right people are in the pictures, only, as stated above, at a different place and at another time. The divergence thus highlighted between space, time and individual remains tangible in Thyes’s works, and conveys to the viewer a profound sense of the mood of the people in this city. ...\" \n\nMalcolm Dickson, director of Street Level Photoworks in Glasgow, in his text \"Glasgow Styles\": \"Myriam Thyes's series Glasgow Styles delineates how Glasgow as a contemporary city reflects its past through the present. Initially what seems like a random visual derive is coherently held together through a detailed narrative that the artist has perceptively encountered and which helps to inform Thyes' personal topography of our city. This topography is the city's changing face – a place historically and contemporaneously of contrasts and tensions.\" \n\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "66256", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=66256", "title": "PID controller", "text": "PID controller\n\nA proportional–integral–derivative controller (PID controller or three-term controller) is a control loop feedback mechanism widely used in industrial control systems and a variety of other applications requiring continuously modulated control. A PID controller continuously calculates an \"error value\" formula_1 as the difference between a desired setpoint (SP) and a measured process variable (PV) and applies a correction based on proportional, integral, and derivative terms (denoted \"P\", \"I\", and \"D\" respectively), hence the name.\n\nIn practical terms it automatically applies accurate and responsive correction to a control function. An everyday example is the cruise control on a car, where external influences such as hills (gradients) would decrease speed. The PID algorithm restores from current speed to the desired speed in an optimal way, without delay or overshoot, by controlling the power output of the vehicle's engine. \n\nThe first theoretical analysis and practical application was in the field of automatic steering systems for ships, developed from the early 1920s onwards. It was then used for automatic process control in manufacturing industry, where it was widely implemented in pneumatic, and then electronic, controllers. Today there is universal use of the PID concept in applications requiring accurate and optimised automatic control.\n\nThe distinguishing feature of the PID controller is the ability to use the three \"control terms\" of proportional, integral and derivative influence on the controller output to apply accurate and optimal control. The block diagram on the right shows the principles of how these terms are generated and applied. It shows a PID controller, which continuously calculates an \"error value\" formula_1 as the difference between a desired setpointformula_3 and a measured process variable formula_4, and applies a correction based on proportional, integral, and derivative terms. The controller attempts to minimize the error over time by adjustment of a \"control variable\" formula_5, such as the opening of a control valve, to a new value determined by a weighted sum of the control terms.\n\nIn this model:\n\nTuning – The balance of these effects is achieved by \"loop tuning\" (see later) to produce the optimal control function. The tuning constants are shown below as \"K\" and must be derived for each control application, as they depend on the response characteristics of the complete loop external to the controller. These are dependent on the behaviour of the measuring sensor, the final control element (such as a control valve), any control signal delays and the process itself. Approximate values of constants can usually be initially entered knowing the type of application, but they are normally refined, or tuned, by \"bumping\" the process in practice by introducing a setpoint change and observing the system response. \n\nControl action – The mathematical model and practical loop above both use a \"direct\" control action for all the terms, which means an increasing positive error results in an increasing positive control output for the summed terms to apply correction. However, the output is called \"reverse\" acting if it is necessary to apply negative corrective action. For instance, if the valve in the flow loop was 100–0% valve opening for 0–100% control output – meaning that the controller action has to be reversed. Some process control schemes and final control elements require this reverse action. An example would be a valve for cooling water, where the fail-safe mode, in the case of loss of signal, would be 100% opening of the valve; therefore 0% controller output needs to cause 100% valve opening.\n\nThe overall control function can be expressed mathematically as\n\nwhere formula_7, formula_8, and formula_9, all non-negative, denote the coefficients for the proportional, integral, and derivative terms respectively (sometimes denoted \"P\", \"I\", and \"D\").\n\nIn the \"standard form\" of the equation (see later in article), formula_8 and formula_9 are respectively replaced by formula_12 and formula_13; the advantage of this being that formula_14 and formula_15 have some understandable physical meaning, as they represent the integration time and the derivative time respectively.\n\nAlthough a PID controller has three control terms, some applications use only one or two terms to provide the appropriate control. This is achieved by setting the unused parameters to zero and is called a PI, PD, P or I controller in the absence of the other control actions. PI controllers are fairly common, since derivative action is sensitive to measurement noise, whereas the absence of an integral term may prevent the system from reaching its target value.\n\nThe use of the PID algorithm does not guarantee optimal control of the system or its control stability . Situations may occur where there are excessive delays: the measurement of the process value is delayed, or the control action does not apply quickly enough. In these cases lead–lag compensation is required to be effective. The response of the controller can be described in terms of its responsiveness to an error, the degree to which the system overshoots a setpoint, and the degree of any system oscillation. But the PID controller is broadly applicable, since it relies only on the response of the measured process variable, not on knowledge or a model of the underlying process.\n\nContinuous control, before PID controllers were fully understood and implemented, has one of its origins in the centrifugal governor which uses rotating weights to control a process. This had been invented by Christian Huygens in the 17th century to regulate the gap between millstones in windmills depending on the speed of rotation, and thereby compensate for the variable speed of grain feed.\n\nWith the invention of the low-pressure, stationary steam engine there was a need for automatic speed control, and James Watt’s self-designed, \"conical pendulum\" governor, a set of revolving steel balls attached to a vertical spindle by link arms, came to be an industry standard. This was based on the mill stone gap control concept.\n\nRotating governor speed control, however, was still variable under conditions of varying load, where the shortcoming of what is now known as proportional control alone was evident. The error between the desired speed and the actual speed would increase with increasing load. In the 19th century the theoretical basis for the operation of governors was first described by James Clerk Maxwell in 1868 in his now-famous paper \"On Governors\". He explored the mathematical basis for control stability, and progressed a good way towards a solution, but made an appeal for mathematicians to examine the problem. The problem was examined further by Edward Routh in 1874, Charles Sturm and in 1895, Adolf Hurwitz, who all contributed to the establishment of control stability criteria.\nIn practice, speed governors were further refined, notably by American scientist Willard Gibbs, who in 1872 theoretically analysed Watt’s conical pendulum governor.\n\nAbout this time, the invention of the Whitehead torpedo posed a control problem which required accurate control of the running depth. Use of a depth pressure sensor alone proved inadequate, and a pendulum which measured the fore and aft pitch of the torpedo was combined with depth measurement to become the pendulum-and-hydrostat control. Pressure control provided only a proportional control which, if the control gain was too high, would become unstable and go into overshoot, with considerable instability of depth-holding. The pendulum added what is now known as derivative control, which damped the oscillations by detecting the torpedo dive/climb angle and thereby the rate of change of depth. This development (named by Whitehead as \"The Secret\" to give no clue to its action) was around 1868.\n\nAnother early example of a PID-type controller was developed by Elmer Sperry in 1911 for ship-steering, though his work was intuitive rather than mathematically-based.\n\nIt was not until 1922, however, that a formal control law for what we now call PID or three-term control was first developed using theoretical analysis, by Russian American engineer Nicolas Minorsky. Minorsky was researching and designing automatic ship steering for the US Navy and based his analysis on observations of a helmsman. He noted the helmsman steered the ship based not only on the current course error, but also on past error, as well as the current rate of change; this was then given a mathematical treatment by Minorsky.\nHis goal was stability, not general control, which simplified the problem significantly. While proportional control provided stability against small disturbances, it was insufficient for dealing with a steady disturbance, notably a stiff gale (due to steady-state error), which required adding the integral term. Finally, the derivative term was added to improve stability and control.\n\nTrials were carried out on the USS \"New Mexico\", with the controllers controlling the \"angular velocity\" (not angle) of the rudder. PI control yielded sustained yaw (angular error) of ±2°. Adding the D element yielded a yaw error of ±1/6°, better than most helmsmen could achieve.\n\nThe Navy ultimately did not adopt the system due to resistance by personnel. Similar work was carried out and published by several others in the 1930s.\n\nThe wide use of feedback controllers did not become feasible until the development of wide band high-gain amplifiers to use the concept of negative feedback. This had been developed in telephone engineering electronics by Harold Black in the late 1920s, but not published until 1934. Independently, Clesson E Mason of the Foxboro Company in 1930 invented a wide-band pneumatic controller by combining the nozzle and flapper high-gain pneumatic amplifier, which had been invented in 1914, with negative feedback from the controller output. This dramatically increased the linear range of operation of the nozzle and flapper amplifier, and integral control could also be added by the use of a precision bleed valve and a bellows generating the Integral term. The result was the \"Stabilog\" controller which gave both proportional and integral functions using feedback bellows. Later the derivative term was added by a further bellows and adjustable orifice. \n\nFrom about 1932 onwards, the use of wideband pneumatic controllers increased rapidly in a variety of control applications. Compressed air was used both for generating the controller output, and for powering the process modulating device; such as a diaphragm operated control valve. They were simple low maintenance devices which operate well in a harsh industrial environment, and did not present an explosion risk in hazardous locations. They were the industry standard for many decades until the advent of discrete electronic controllers and distributed control systems.\n\nWith these controllers, a pneumatic industry signalling standard of was established, which had an elevated zero to ensure devices were working within their linear characteristic and represented the control range of 0-100%.\n\nIn the 1950s, when high gain electronic amplifiers became cheap and reliable, electronic PID controllers became popular, and 4–20 mA current loop signals were used which emulated the pneumatic standard. However field actuators still widely use the pneumatic standard because of the advantages of pneumatic motive power for control valves in process plant environments.\n\nMost modern PID controls in industry are implemented in distributed control systems (DCS), programmable logic controllers (PLCs), computer-based controllers or as a compact controller. Software implementations have the advantages that they are relatively cheap and flexible with respect to the implementation of the PID algorithm in a particular control scenario.\n\nElectronic analog PID control loops were often found within more complex electronic systems, for example, the head positioning of a disk drive, the power conditioning of a power supply, or even the movement-detection circuit of a modern seismometer. Discrete electronic analogue controllers have been largely replaced by digital controllers using microcontrollers or FPGAs to implement PID algorithms. However, discrete analog PID controllers are still used in niche applications requiring high-bandwidth and low-noise performance, such as laser-diode controllers.\n\nLet's take the example of a robotic arm, that can be moved and positioned by a control loop. An electric motor may lift or lower the arm, depending on forward or reverse power applied, but power cannot be a simple function of position because of the inertial mass of the arm, forces due to gravity, external forces on the arm such as a load to lift or work to be done on an external object.\n\nBy measuring the position (PV), and subtracting it from the setpoint (SP), the error (e) is found, and from it the controller calculates how much electric current to supply to the motor (MV).\n\nThe obvious method is proportional control: the motor current is set in proportion to the existing error. However, this method fails if, for instance, the arm has to lift different weights: a greater weight needs a greater force applied for a same error on the down side, but a smaller force if the error is on the upside. That's where the integral and derivative terms play their part.\n\nAn integral term increases action in relation not only to the error but also the time for which it has persisted. So, if applied force is not enough to bring the error to zero, this force will be increased as time passes. A pure \"I\" controller could bring the error to zero, however, it would be both slow reacting at the start (because action would be small at the beginning, needing time to get significant) and brutal (the action increases as long as the error is positive, even if the error has started to approach zero).\n\nA derivative term does not consider the error (meaning it cannot bring it to zero: a pure D controller cannot bring the system to its setpoint), but the rate of change of error, trying to bring this rate to zero. It aims at flattening the error trajectory into a horizontal line, damping the force applied, and so reduces overshoot (error on the other side because too great applied force). Applying too much impetus when the error is small and decreasing will lead to overshoot. After overshooting, if the controller were to apply a large correction in the opposite direction and repeatedly overshoot the desired position, the output would oscillate around the setpoint in either a constant, growing, or decaying sinusoid. If the amplitude of the oscillations increase with time, the system is unstable. If they decrease, the system is stable. If the oscillations remain at a constant magnitude, the system is marginally stable.\n\nIn the interest of achieving a controlled arrival at the desired position (SP) in a timely and accurate way, the controlled system needs to be critically damped. A well-tuned position control system will also apply the necessary currents to the controlled motor so that the arm pushes and pulls as necessary to resist external forces trying to move it away from the required position. The setpoint itself may be generated by an external system, such as a PLC or other computer system, so that it continuously varies depending on the work that the robotic arm is expected to do. A well-tuned PID control system will enable the arm to meet these changing requirements to the best of its capabilities.\n\nIf a controller starts from a stable state with zero error (PV = SP), then further changes by the controller will be in response to changes in other measured or unmeasured inputs to the process that affect the process, and hence the PV. Variables that affect the process other than the MV are known as disturbances. Generally controllers are used to reject disturbances and to implement setpoint changes. A change in load on the arm constitutes a disturbance to the robot arm control process.\n\nIn theory, a controller can be used to control any process which has a measurable output (PV), a known ideal value for that output (SP) and an input to the process (MV) that will affect the relevant PV. Controllers are used in industry to regulate temperature, pressure, force, feed rate, flow rate, chemical composition (component concentrations), weight, position, speed, and practically every other variable for which a measurement exists.\n\nThe PID control scheme is named after its three correcting terms, whose sum constitutes the manipulated variable (MV). The proportional, integral, and derivative terms are summed to calculate the output of the PID controller. Defining formula_5 as the controller output, the final form of the PID algorithm is\n\nwhere\n\nEquivalently, the transfer function in the Laplace domain of the PID controller is\n\nwhere formula_26 is the complex frequency.\n\nThe proportional term produces an output value that is proportional to the current error value. The proportional response can be adjusted by multiplying the error by a constant \"K\", called the proportional gain constant.\n\nThe proportional term is given by\n\nA high proportional gain results in a large change in the output for a given change in the error. If the proportional gain is too high, the system can become unstable (see the section on loop tuning). In contrast, a small gain results in a small output response to a large input error, and a less responsive or less sensitive controller. If the proportional gain is too low, the control action may be too small when responding to system disturbances. Tuning theory and industrial practice indicate that the proportional term should contribute the bulk of the output change.\n\nBecause a non-zero error is required to drive it, a proportional controller generally operates with a so-called \"steady-state error\". Steady-state error (SSE) is proportional to the process gain and inversely proportional to proportional gain. SSE may be mitigated by adding a compensating bias term to the setpoint AND output, or corrected dynamically by adding an integral term.\n\nThe contribution from the integral term is proportional to both the magnitude of the error and the duration of the error. The integral in a PID controller is the sum of the instantaneous error over time and gives the accumulated offset that should have been corrected previously. The accumulated error is then multiplied by the integral gain (\"K\") and added to the controller output.\n\nThe integral term is given by\n\nThe integral term accelerates the movement of the process towards setpoint and eliminates the residual steady-state error that occurs with a pure proportional controller. However, since the integral term responds to accumulated errors from the past, it can cause the present value to overshoot the setpoint value (see the section on loop tuning).\n\nThe derivative of the process error is calculated by determining the slope of the error over time and multiplying this rate of change by the derivative gain \"K\". The magnitude of the contribution of the derivative term to the overall control action is termed the derivative gain, \"K\".\n\nThe derivative term is given by\n\nDerivative action predicts system behavior and thus improves settling time and stability of the system. An ideal derivative is not causal, so that implementations of PID controllers include an additional low-pass filtering for the derivative term to limit the high-frequency gain and noise. Derivative action is seldom used in practice though – by one estimate in only 25% of deployed controllers – because of its variable impact on system stability in real-world applications.\n\n\"Tuning\" a control loop is the adjustment of its control parameters (proportional band/gain, integral gain/reset, derivative gain/rate) to the optimum values for the desired control response. Stability (no unbounded oscillation) is a basic requirement, but beyond that, different systems have different behavior, different applications have different requirements, and requirements may conflict with one another.\n\nPID tuning is a difficult problem, even though there are only three parameters and in principle is simple to describe, because it must satisfy complex criteria within the limitations of PID control. There are accordingly various methods for loop tuning, and more sophisticated techniques are the subject of patents; this section describes some traditional manual methods for loop tuning.\n\nDesigning and tuning a PID controller appears to be conceptually intuitive, but can be hard in practice, if multiple (and often conflicting) objectives such as short transient and high stability are to be achieved. PID controllers often provide acceptable control using default tunings, but performance can generally be improved by careful tuning, and performance may be unacceptable with poor tuning. Usually, initial designs need to be adjusted repeatedly through computer simulations until the closed-loop system performs or compromises as desired.\n\nSome processes have a degree of nonlinearity and so parameters that work well at full-load conditions don't work when the process is starting up from no-load; this can be corrected by gain scheduling (using different parameters in different operating regions).\n\nIf the PID controller parameters (the gains of the proportional, integral and derivative terms) are chosen incorrectly, the controlled process input can be unstable, i.e., its output diverges, with or without oscillation, and is limited only by saturation or mechanical breakage. Instability is caused by \"excess\" gain, particularly in the presence of significant lag.\n\nGenerally, stabilization of response is required and the process must not oscillate for any combination of process conditions and setpoints, though sometimes marginal stability (bounded oscillation) is acceptable or desired.\n\nMathematically, the origins of instability can be seen in the Laplace domain.\n\nThe total loop transfer function is:\nwhere\n\nThe system is called unstable where the closed loop transfer function diverges for some formula_26. This happens for situations where formula_34. Typically, this happens when formula_35 with a 180 degree phase shift. Stability is guaranteed when formula_36 for frequencies that suffer high phase shifts. A more general formalism of this effect is known as the Nyquist stability criterion.\n\nThe optimal behavior on a process change or setpoint change varies depending on the application.\n\nTwo basic requirements are \"regulation\" (disturbance rejection – staying at a given setpoint) and \"command tracking\" (implementing setpoint changes) – these refer to how well the controlled variable tracks the desired value. Specific criteria for command tracking include rise time and settling time. Some processes must not allow an overshoot of the process variable beyond the setpoint if, for example, this would be unsafe. Other processes must minimize the energy expended in reaching a new setpoint.\n\nThere are several methods for tuning a PID loop. The most effective methods generally involve the development of some form of process model, then choosing P, I, and D based on the dynamic model parameters. Manual tuning methods can be relatively time consuming, particularly for systems with long loop times.\n\nThe choice of method will depend largely on whether or not the loop can be taken \"offline\" for tuning, and on the response time of the system. If the system can be taken offline, the best tuning method often involves subjecting the system to a step change in input, measuring the output as a function of time, and using this response to determine the control parameters. \n\nIf the system must remain online, one tuning method is to first set formula_37 and formula_38 values to zero. Increase the formula_39 until the output of the loop oscillates, then the formula_39 should be set to approximately half of that value for a \"quarter amplitude decay\" type response. Then increase formula_37 until any offset is corrected in sufficient time for the process. However, too much formula_37 will cause instability. Finally, increase formula_38, if required, until the loop is acceptably quick to reach its reference after a load disturbance. However, too much formula_38 will cause excessive response and overshoot. A fast PID loop tuning usually overshoots slightly to reach the setpoint more quickly; however, some systems cannot accept overshoot, in which case an overdamped closed-loop system is required, which will require a formula_39 setting significantly less than half that of the formula_39 setting that was causing oscillation.\n\nAnother heuristic tuning method is formally known as the Ziegler–Nichols method, introduced by John G. Ziegler and Nathaniel B. Nichols in the 1940s. As in the method above, the formula_37 and formula_38 gains are first set to zero. The proportional gain is increased until it reaches the ultimate gain, formula_49, at which the output of the loop starts to oscillate. formula_49 and the oscillation period formula_51 are used to set the gains as follows:\nThese gains apply to the ideal, parallel form of the PID controller. When applied to the standard PID form, only the integral and derivative time parameters formula_52 and formula_53 are dependent on the oscillation period formula_51. Please see the section \"Alternative nomenclature and PID forms\".\n\nThis method was developed in 1953 and is based on a first-order + time delay model. Similar to the Ziegler–Nichols method, a set of tuning parameters were developed to yield a closed-loop response with a decay ratio of 1/4. Arguably the biggest problem with these parameters is that a small change in the process parameters could potentially cause a closed-loop system to become unstable\n\nPublished in 1984 by Karl Johan Åström and Tore Hägglund, the relay method temporarily operates the process using bang-bang control and measures the resultant oscillations. The output is switched (as if by a relay, hence the name) between two values of the control variable. The values must be chosen so the process will cross the setpoint, but need not be 0% and 100%; by choosing suitable values, dangerous oscillations can be avoided.\n\nAs long as the process variable is below the setpoint, the control output is set to the higher value. As soon as it rises above the setpoint, the control output is set to the lower value. Ideally, the output waveform is nearly square, spending equal time above and below the setpoint. The period and amplitude of the resultant oscillations are measured, and used to compute the ultimate gain and period, which are then fed into the Ziegler–Nichols method.\n\nSpecifically, the ultimate period formula_51 is assumed to be equal to the observed period, and the ultimate gain is computed as formula_56 where is the amplitude of the process variable oscillation, and is the amplitude of the control output change which caused it.\n\nThere are numerous variants on the relay method.\n\nMost modern industrial facilities no longer tune loops using the manual calculation methods shown above. Instead, PID tuning and loop optimization software are used to ensure consistent results. These software packages will gather the data, develop process models, and suggest optimal tuning. Some software packages can even develop tuning by gathering data from reference changes.\n\nMathematical PID loop tuning induces an impulse in the system, and then uses the controlled system's frequency response to design the PID loop values. In loops with response times of several minutes, mathematical loop tuning is recommended, because trial and error can take days just to find a stable set of loop values. Optimal values are harder to find. Some digital loop controllers offer a self-tuning feature in which very small setpoint changes are sent to the process, allowing the controller itself to calculate optimal tuning values.\n\nOther formulas are available to tune the loop according to different performance criteria. Many patented formulas are now embedded within PID tuning software and hardware modules.\n\nAdvances in automated PID loop tuning software also deliver algorithms for tuning PID Loops in a dynamic or non-steady state (NSS) scenario. The software will model the dynamics of a process, through a disturbance, and calculate PID control parameters in response.\n\nWhile PID controllers are applicable to many control problems, and often perform satisfactorily without any improvements or only coarse tuning, they can perform poorly in some applications, and do not in general provide \"optimal\" control. The fundamental difficulty with PID control is that it is a feedback control system, with \"constant\" parameters, and no direct knowledge of the process, and thus overall performance is reactive and a compromise. While PID control is the best controller in an observer without a model of the process, better performance can be obtained by overtly modeling the actor of the process without resorting to an observer.\n\nPID controllers, when used alone, can give poor performance when the PID loop gains must be reduced so that the control system does not overshoot, oscillate or hunt about the control setpoint value. They also have difficulties in the presence of non-linearities, may trade-off regulation versus response time, do not react to changing process behavior (say, the process changes after it has warmed up), and have lag in responding to large disturbances.\n\nThe most significant improvement is to incorporate feed-forward control with knowledge about the system, and using the PID only to control error. Alternatively, PIDs can be modified in more minor ways, such as by changing the parameters (either gain scheduling in different use cases or adaptively modifying them based on performance), improving measurement (higher sampling rate, precision, and accuracy, and low-pass filtering if necessary), or cascading multiple PID controllers.\n\nAnother problem faced with PID controllers is that they are linear, and in particular symmetric. Thus, performance of PID controllers in non-linear systems (such as HVAC systems) is variable. For example, in temperature control, a common use case is active heating (via a heating element) but passive cooling (heating off, but no cooling), so overshoot can only be corrected slowly – it cannot be forced downward. In this case the PID should be tuned to be overdamped, to prevent or reduce overshoot, though this reduces performance (it increases settling time).\n\nA problem with the derivative term is that it amplifies higher frequency measurement or process noise that can cause large amounts of change in the output. It is often helpful to filter the measurements with a low-pass filter in order to remove higher-frequency noise components. As low-pass filtering and derivative control can cancel each other out, the amount of filtering is limited. So low noise instrumentation can be important. A nonlinear median filter may be used, which improves the filtering efficiency and practical performance. In some cases, the differential band can be turned off with little loss of control. This is equivalent to using the PID controller as a PI controller.\n\nThe basic PID algorithm presents some challenges in control applications that have been addressed by minor modifications to the PID form.\n\nOne common problem resulting from the ideal PID implementations is integral windup. Following a large change in setpoint the integral term can accumulate an error larger than the maximal value for the regulation variable (windup), thus the system overshoots and continues to increase until this accumulated error is unwound. This problem can be addressed by:\n\n\nFor example, a PID loop is used to control the temperature of an electric resistance furnace where the system has stabilized. Now when the door is opened and something cold is put into the furnace the temperature drops below the setpoint. The integral function of the controller tends to compensate for error by introducing another error in the positive direction. This overshoot can be avoided by freezing of the integral function after the opening of the door for the time the control loop typically needs to reheat the furnace.\n\nA PI Controller (proportional-integral controller) is a special case of the PID controller in which the derivative (D) of the error is not used.\n\nThe controller output is given by\nwhere formula_58 is the error or deviation of actual measured value (PV) from the setpoint (SP).\n\nA PI controller can be modelled easily in software such as Simulink or Xcos using a \"flow chart\" box involving Laplace operators:\nwhere\n\nSetting a value for formula_63 is often a trade off between decreasing overshoot and increasing settling time.\n\nThe lack of derivative action may make the system more steady in the steady state in the case of noisy data. This is because derivative action is more sensitive to higher-frequency terms in the inputs.\n\nWithout derivative action, a PI-controlled system is less responsive to real (non-noise) and relatively fast alterations in state and so the system will be slower to reach setpoint and slower to respond to perturbations than a well-tuned PID system may be.\n\nMany PID loops control a mechanical device (for example, a valve). Mechanical maintenance can be a major cost and wear leads to control degradation in the form of either stiction or backlash in the mechanical response to an input signal. The rate of mechanical wear is mainly a function of how often a device is activated to make a change. Where wear is a significant concern, the PID loop may have an output deadband to reduce the frequency of activation of the output (valve). This is accomplished by modifying the controller to hold its output steady if the change would be small (within the defined deadband range). The calculated output must leave the deadband before the actual output will change.\n\nThe proportional and derivative terms can produce excessive movement in the output when a system is subjected to an instantaneous step increase in the error, such as a large setpoint change. In the case of the derivative term, this is due to taking the derivative of the error, which is very large in the case of an instantaneous step change. As a result, some PID algorithms incorporate some of the following modifications:\n\n\nThe control system performance can be improved by combining the feedback (or closed-loop) control of a PID controller with feed-forward (or open-loop) control. Knowledge about the system (such as the desired acceleration and inertia) can be fed forward and combined with the PID output to improve the overall system performance. The feed-forward value alone can often provide the major portion of the controller output. The PID controller primarily has to compensate whatever difference or \"error\" remains between the setpoint (SP) and the system response to the open loop control. Since the feed-forward output is not affected by the process feedback, it can never cause the control system to oscillate, thus improving the system response without affecting stability. Feed forward can be based on the setpoint and on extra measured disturbances. Setpoint weighting is a simple form of feed forward.\n\nFor example, in most motion control systems, in order to accelerate a mechanical load under control, more force is required from the actuator. If a velocity loop PID controller is being used to control the speed of the load and command the force being applied by the actuator, then it is beneficial to take the desired instantaneous acceleration, scale that value appropriately and add it to the output of the PID velocity loop controller. This means that whenever the load is being accelerated or decelerated, a proportional amount of force is commanded from the actuator regardless of the feedback value. The PID loop in this situation uses the feedback information to change the combined output to reduce the remaining difference between the process setpoint and the feedback value. Working together, the combined open-loop feed-forward controller and closed-loop PID controller can provide a more responsive control system.\n\nPID controllers are often implemented with a \"bumpless\" initialization feature that recalculates the integral accumulator term to maintain a consistent process output through parameter changes. A partial implementation is to store the integral of the integral gain times the error rather than storing the integral of the error and postmultiplying by the integral gain, which prevents discontinuous output when the I gain is changed, but not the P or D gains.\n\nIn addition to feed-forward, PID controllers are often enhanced through methods such as PID gain scheduling (changing parameters in different operating conditions), fuzzy logic, or computational verb logic. Further practical application issues can arise from instrumentation connected to the controller. A high enough sampling rate, measurement precision, and measurement accuracy are required to achieve adequate control performance. Another new method for improvement of PID controller is to increase the degree of freedom by using fractional order. The order of the integrator and differentiator add increased flexibility to the controller.\n\nOne distinctive advantage of PID controllers is that two PID controllers can be used together to yield better dynamic performance. This is called cascaded PID control. In cascade control there are two PIDs arranged with one PID controlling the setpoint of another. A PID controller acts as outer loop controller, which controls the primary physical parameter, such as fluid level or velocity. The other controller acts as inner loop controller, which reads the output of outer loop controller as setpoint, usually controlling a more rapid changing parameter, flowrate or acceleration. It can be mathematically proven that the working frequency of the controller is increased and the time constant of the object is reduced by using cascaded PID controllers..\n\nFor example, a temperature-controlled circulating bath has two PID controllers in cascade, each with its own thermocouple temperature sensor. The outer controller controls the temperature of the water using a thermocouple located far from the heater where it accurately reads the temperature of the bulk of the water. The error term of this PID controller is the difference between the desired bath temperature and measured temperature. Instead of controlling the heater directly, the outer PID controller sets a heater temperature goal for the inner PID controller. The inner PID controller controls the temperature of the heater using a thermocouple attached to the heater. The inner controller's error term is the difference between this heater temperature setpoint and the measured temperature of the heater. Its output controls the actual heater to stay near this setpoint.\n\nThe proportional, integral, and differential terms of the two controllers will be very different. The outer PID controller has a long time constant – all the water in the tank needs to heat up or cool down. The inner loop responds much more quickly. Each controller can be tuned to match the physics of the system \"it\" controls – heat transfer and thermal mass of the whole tank or of just the heater – giving better total response.\n\nThe form of the PID controller most often encountered in industry, and the one most relevant to tuning algorithms is the \"standard form\". In this form the formula_39 gain is applied to the formula_65, and formula_66 terms, yielding:\n\nwhere\n\nIn this standard form, the parameters have a clear physical meaning. In particular, the inner summation produces a new single error value which is compensated for future and past errors. The proportional error term is the current error. The derivative components term attempts to predict the error value at formula_53 seconds (or samples) in the future, assuming that the loop control remains unchanged. The integral component adjusts the error value to compensate for the sum of all past errors, with the intention of completely eliminating them in formula_52 seconds (or samples). The resulting compensated single error value is then scaled by the single gain formula_39 to compute the control variable.\n\nIn the parallel form, shown in the controller theory section\n\nthe gain parameters are related to the parameters of the standard form through formula_74 and formula_75. This parallel form, where the parameters are treated as simple gains, is the most general and flexible form. However, it is also the form where the parameters have the least physical interpretation and is generally reserved for theoretical treatment of the PID controller. The standard form, despite being slightly more complex mathematically, is more common in industry.\n\nIn many cases, the manipulated variable output by the PID controller is a dimensionless fraction between 0 and 100% of some maximum possible value, and the translation into real units (such as pumping rate or watts of heater power) is outside the PID controller. The process variable, however, is in dimensioned units such as temperature. It is common in this case to express the gain formula_39 not as \"output per degree\", but rather in the reciprocal form of a \"proportional band\" formula_77, which is \"degrees per full output\": the range over which the output changes from 0 to 1 (0% to 100%). Beyond this range, the output is saturated, full-off or full-on. The narrower this band, the higher the proportional gain.\n\nIn most commercial control systems, derivative action is based on process variable rather than error. That is, a change in the setpoint does not affect the derivative action. This is because the digitized version of the algorithm produces a large unwanted spike when the setpoint is changed. If the setpoint is constant then changes in the PV will be the same as changes in error. Therefore, this modification makes no difference to the way the controller responds to process disturbances.\n\nMost commercial control systems offer the \"option\" of also basing the proportional action solely on the process variable. This means that only the integral action responds to changes in the setpoint. The modification to the algorithm does not affect the way the controller responds to process disturbances.\nBasing proportional action on PV eliminates the instant and possibly very large change in output caused by a sudden change to the setpoint. Depending on the process and tuning this may be beneficial to the response to a setpoint step.\nKing describes an effective chart-based method.\n\nSometimes it is useful to write the PID regulator in Laplace transform form:\n\nHaving the PID controller written in Laplace form and having the transfer function of the controlled system makes it easy to determine the closed-loop transfer function of the system.\n\nAnother representation of the PID controller is the series, or \"interacting\" form\nwhere the parameters are related to the parameters of the standard form through\nwith\n\nThis form essentially consists of a PD and PI controller in series, and it made early (analog) controllers easier to build. When the controllers later became digital, many kept using the interacting form.\n\nThe analysis for designing a digital implementation of a PID controller in a microcontroller (MCU) or FPGA device requires the standard form of the PID controller to be \"discretized\". Approximations for first-order derivatives are made by backward finite differences. The integral term is discretised, with a sampling time formula_85, as follows,\n\nThe derivative term is approximated as,\n\nThus, a \"velocity algorithm\" for implementation of the discretized PID controller in a MCU is obtained by differentiating formula_5, using the numerical definitions of the first and second derivative and solving for formula_89 and finally obtaining:\n\ns.t. formula_91\n\nHere is a simple software loop that implements a PID algorithm:\nIn this example, two variables that will be maintained within the loop are initialized to zero, then the loop begins. The current \"error\" is calculated by subtracting the \"measured_value\" (the process variable, or PV) from the current \"setpoint\" (SP). Then, \"integral\" and \"derivative\" values are calculated, and these and the \"error\" are combined with three preset gain terms – the proportional gain, the integral gain and the derivative gain – to derive an \"output\" value. \n\nIn the real world, this is D-to-A converted and passed into the process under control as the manipulated variable (MV). The current error is stored elsewhere for re-use in the next differentiation, the program then waits until dt seconds have passed since start, and the loop begins again, reading in new values for the PV and the setpoint and calculating a new value for the error.\n\nNote that for real code, the use of \"wait(dt)\" might be inappropriate because it doesn't account for time taken by the algorithm itself during the loop, or more importantly, any preemption delaying the algorithm.\n\n\nBequette, B.

It is filled through a wider opening at the opposite end, rolled or twisted closed, and then squeezed to extrude its contents.\n\nThough a circular nozzle is quite useful for making round shapes and for filling pastries such as profiteroles, many differently shaped nozzles are commonly used to produce star, leaf, and flower-petal shapes.\n\nAside from icing, pastry bags are commonly used to shape meringue and whipped cream, and to fill doughnuts with jelly or custard. They are used to form cream puffs, éclairs, and ladyfingers. When presentation is especially important, fluted tips can be used to shape savory foods such as filling for deviled eggs, whipped butter, and mashed potatoes (especially for \"Pommes duchesse\").\n\nA high-quality reusable bag is often made from tightly woven nylon, polyester, rubber or waterproofed (plastic-coated) cotton. Medium quality bags are similar, except they are not so tightly woven and may let some contents seep through the weave or the seams. After use, a reusable bag is washed by hand and hung open to dry. A high-quality bag may last for many years.\n\nPastry bag users who do not have a dishwashing machine may prefer to use disposable bags, and thus avoid hand-washing messy bags. Disposable bags are ready-made in inexpensive plastic. A plastic food storage bag is also commonly used as a pastry bag. For small quantities and fine piping, a pastry bag can be made by rolling cooking parchment or wax paper into a cone, filling it, folding the wide end several times to close it, and then cutting the tip into whatever shape is desired. This is especially useful for small quantities of melted chocolate, since a very small hole can be cut and the bag can be discarded when it cools and becomes clogged.\n\nTips come in sets of interchangeable pieces; expensive tips can be purchased one at a time. They may be chrome-plated or stainless steel, or plastic. Each tip is cone-shaped, with a base too large to fit through the small opening in the bag; they are to be inserted through the larger opening before food is spooned in. Tips can be used with pairs of adapter rings: an inner ring is dropped inside the bag and pushed part way out the hole, a tip is slipped over the ring, then an outer ring is slipped over the tip and screwed onto the inner ring. This permits the tip to be changed without emptying the bag. Some inexpensive sets are of disposable plastic film with a drop-in ring and screw-on plastic tips (see image above). Many foods (including frosting and pressurized \"spray can\" whipped cream) can be purchased in disposable packaging designed to serve the function of a pastry bag.\n\n"}
{"id": "16053164", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=16053164", "title": "Pot-holder", "text": "Pot-holder\n\nA pot-holder is a piece of textile (often quilted) or silicone used to cover the hand when holding hot kitchen cooking equipment, like pots and pans. They are frequently made of polyester and/or cotton. Crocheted pot-holders can be made out of cotton yarn as a craft project/folk art.\nA pot-holder offers protection for only one hand at a time. To lift a pan with two hot handles using both hands, two pot-holders are needed. For holding a hot piece of equipment, the pot-holder is folded around it and grasped with the hand. Generally a rubber surface will be on one side to grip and a fabric side to absorb the heat on the other side.\n\nWhen made of textile fabric, pot-holders typically have an inner layer of a material providing thermal insulation sandwiched between more colorful or decorative outsides. The most common type commercially available nowadays has the form of a square, with a side length varying from to and slightly rounded corners, and a textile loop at one of the corners for hanging.\n\nThroughout the pot-holder's lifetime, it has also been used as a representative symbol of various cultural movements. During the United States Abolitionist Movement, they were displayed by women who wanted to show their support for the Abolitionist cause. These provided women with some way to casually identify as part of the Abolitionist Movement without overtly expressing such. Additionally, it is sometimes used by Cajun cultures as part of their Mardi Gras masks. During the internment of Japanese Americans during World War II, the interred Japanese created several pot-holders out of various colored fabrics in order to reflect their own culture. This was done to break up the monotony, as the colorful nature of the crafts was in stark contrast to the generally bland surroundings of the camps.\n\nThe earliest records of pot-holders in the United States stem from the early 1900s, when pot-holders were made out of lace, as well as crocheted and embroidered. The usage of lace fell away at the same time as the popularization of geometric patterns on pot-holders, lasting up until the late 1970s. At the same time, applique methods began to become popularly used around the 1960s, and remained the most popular method, alongside of quilting up through the 1970s to the present.\n\nThe textile potholder was nonexistent in art or writing until around the 19th century. Evidence in art points towards hooks that were used to carry hot-handled pots in ancient Greece, but it wasn't until the Antislavery Bazaars of the mid-19th century that equivocally the first home-made potholders were made. These crafts were illustrated with various designs and advertised the phrase 'Any holder but a Slave Holder.\" By creating such a political craft, which shares similar dimensions and fabrication with the contemporary potholder, women who may have never associated with the abolitionist movement had the opportunity to do so. The popularity of potholders is concomitant with the rise in proliferation of magazines. In these magazines, patterns were given for 'teapot holders' which strongly resemble potholders. Insulation capability was limited in early models. Since their genesis as standard household items, potholders have been largely associated with home crafting, and crocheting has long been the leading method in this strain followed by knitting and patchwork. Needlework patterns in the 1950s were often impractical and over-designed with holes and elaborate spacing that would burn the user or wear out the holder quickly. In the 1970s, quilting and applique-made potholder patterns gained popularity, enduring into the present day.\n\nPot-holders are a form of Personal Protective Equipment or PPE. They are used in kitchen settings to protect the kitchen staff from heat related injuries. However, one issue with having pot holders in commercial kitchens is that they are not sanitary. According to \"Food Service Technology 2.2\", research has shown that Pot-holders are one of the sole culprits of cross contamination in the kitchen. This occurs when someone in the kitchen is working with raw food and then uses a Pot-holder without proper sanitation. When the next person uses the Pot-holder, they are subject to all the germs left behind previously. Another issue with Pot-holders is that the materials that they are made out of are often not water resistant, making them impossible to wash. This poses a problem because kitchens are full of accidental spills, and if a pot-holder becomes soiled, there is no quick solution to cleaning it. If a pot holder becomes wet in any way, it becomes a steam burn risk. Because of these risks, Pot-holders have been banned from commercial kitchens in New Zealand, but there is no sign of them doing so in the United States anytime soon.\n\nPot holders need to withstand temperatures over 400 degrees Fahrenheit to protect skin from hot dishes and make a potentially harmful task harmless. A common fabric used for pot-holders is wool because it can withstand very hot temperatures.\n\nWhat makes wool a unique product is that it is essentially flame resistant. The combination of sulfur and nitrogen provides a blend of materials that provide a flame-resistant product. The reason wool is used for many types of heat protection is that it has a low ignition temperature. This is defined as the temperature in which an item will produce a flame. Wool can be heated to over 1,000 degrees Fahrenheit before the igniting of this fabric. Even when the fabric comes in contact with flames it does not disseminate the flame. This provides an even greater protective quality with the wool's low ignition temperature and the inability for flames to spread throughout the fiber. When wool is heated to a certain degree, it begins to \"char\" on the outside. This can provide a protective outer layer on the outside fabric. When the char on the outside of the fabric is consistent with the original properties of the wool, it can produce a safer version of the product. When the heat is directly applied to the fabric, the \"char\" forms a semi-liquid state which can be wiped off the fabric providing no evidence of the heat contact.\n\nIn the early days of \"Do it yourself\" and domestic craftwork, projects like quilting, sewing, knitting, and crocheting were used for both labor and leisure. These activities are commonly used methods to make pot-holders. Craftwork of this nature has often been associated with women and children as a tradition to be passed down from mother to daughter since before the eighteenth century. By the mid-eighteenth century, it was seen as the woman's duty to decorate and fill their home with these different types of homemaking crafts. Pot-holders appeared as one of these crafts in the late nineteenth century, usually marketed to accompany kettles and teapots.\n\nPatterns to create pot-holders at home were first seen in the United States in pamphlets and magazines, including periodicals like \"Workbasket\", whose primary target audience consisted of the middle and working classes. This appearance of needlework patterns in magazines began around 1880 and continued to be prominent through the 1930s. During the Depression Era, designs for potholders were being published by the household press as well as makers of yarns and threads. This period of time is when pot-holders blossomed into the useful, diverse art form that is recognized by needleworkers today.\n\nCommon types of pot-holder making at home include quilting, knitting, and crocheting. These techniques use different mediums such as yarn or scraps of fabric in order to create pot-holders of all different colors and patterns. Many \"DIY\" tutorials teach how to make a simple square pot-holder, but there are also many that teach a variety of shapes, sizes, and designs, including little houses or flowers. These homemade kitchen tools are often considered good for home decor or gift giving.\n\nBy the early 20th century, pot-holders were regularly featured in United States' advertisements. They were featured in magazine and newspaper ads for kitchen appliances, usually providing protection between a woman's hands and her pot or pan of freshly cooked food. The appliance being advertised would often be featured as a backdrop. A typical advertisement would show a young, smiling woman using pot-holders to remove her freshly cooked bread from the oven. Though the advertisement would usually be for an oven or stove, the pot-holders are featured as a mainstay in a trendy young woman's kitchen.\n\n"}

{"id": "26822776", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=26822776", "title": "Reactive multi-layer foil", "text": "Reactive multi-layer foil\n\nReactive multi-layer foils are a class of reactive materials, sometimes referred to as a pyrotechnic initiator of two mutually reactive metals, sputtered to form thin layers that create a laminated foil. On initiation by a heat pulse, delivered by a bridge wire, a laser pulse, an electric spark, a flame, or by other means, the metals undergo self-sustaining exothermic reaction, producing an intermetallic compound. The reaction occurs in solid and liquid phase only, without releasing any gas. \n\nOne particular type of such materials is aluminum-nickel multilayered foil, that produces (NiAl). Other similar materials are composed of aluminium-titanium, or titanium-amorphous silicon, are used for joining materials by reactive bonding. Other similar intermetallic compositions used in pyrotechnics are titanium-boron and aluminium-palladium (\"Pyrofuze\").\n\nThese foils are made in a range of thicknesses, e.g. 60, 80, 100, and 150 micrometers. The flame front propagation rate ranges generally between 7.5–9 m/s. The reaction temperature can reach up to 1500 °C for a millisecond. The energy released is approximately 1200 to 1300 joules per gram. The velocity and temperature of the reaction can be controlled by adjusting the thickness of the layers. Typical thickness is 50 nm per a bilayer. The thin layers maximize the contact between the metal and lower the activation energy for the reaction, normally too high to allow reaction between bulk aluminium and bulk nickel. The layers are deposited by sequential sputtering of alternately nickel and aluminium.\n\nNickel aluminide will ignite on heating to at least 250 °C in rate of at least 200 °C/min. Slower heating will anneal the material, causing loss of its pyrotechnic properties. For electrical initiation, a momentary contact at 10A/5V is sufficient; for ohmic contact, 120-150 amperes is needed for a 15 micrometer diameter contact, and 250-300 A for a 300 micrometer contact. It can be also ignited by a heat paper. When the flame front reaches the edge of the material, particles of molten metal can be ejected, causing voids in the bond; this can be prevented by simultaneous ignition from more sides, so the flame fronts meet in the middle, confined by the substrates.\n\nThe foil can be both cut and ignited by a laser. The pulse width and power determines if the material will be cut or initiated.It is frequently used for soldering and brazing, as a heat source. When sandwiched between the components to be joined, either with a foil of solder on each side, using solder precoated components, or using solder-coated foil, it uniformly delivers significant amount of heat energy across the entire area, melting the solder and only locally heating the surface of the substrates, lowering the heat load on the component in comparison with soldering/brazing in a furnace. An externally applied even pressure during reaction and cooling serves to ensure a good homogeneous joint without voids. Significantly dissimilar materials can be bonded without cracking: semiconductors, metals, ceramics, and polymers. The energy is deposited very locally, without significant heating of the bulk of the substrates, which reduces problems with mismatched thermal expansion coefficients between the materials and allows their joining at room temperature.\n\nThe bonding process can be used in assembly of electronics, die attachment to heatsinks where high temperature stability is required (e.g. high-power LEDs or concentrated photovoltaics solar panels, soldering together layers of composite armor plates, bonding of large sputtering targets made of ceramics or refractory metals where normal indium based solders cannot be used, and other applications where a uniform joint over large area has to be created.\n\nThe foil can be used as a pyrotechnic heat source, a replacement of potassium chlorate/iron pellets, for thermal batteries. It reacts faster than the conventional composition, reaches higher temperatures, and heat buffers of inert metal (e.g. steel) are needed to lower the peak temperature and prolong the heat delivery.\nThey can be also used as an electrically initiated pyrotechnic initiator, e.g. to ignite solid propellants, and in decoy flares. They can be employed in weapons as reactive materials, enhancing the energy delivery to the targets by the projectiles or their fragments.\n\n"}

It is considered an enhanced oil recovery (EOR) method and is the main type of thermal stimulation of oil reservoirs. There are several different forms of the technology, with the two main ones being Cyclic Steam Stimulation and Steam Flooding. Both are most commonly applied to oil reservoirs, which are relatively shallow and which contain crude oils which are very viscous at the temperature of the native underground formation. Steam injection is widely used in the San Joaquin Valley of California (USA), the Lake Maracaibo area of Venezuela, and the oil sands of northern Alberta (Canada).\n\nAnother contributing factor that enhances oil production during steam injection is related to near-wellbore cleanup. In this case, steam reduces the viscosity that ties paraffins and asphaltenes to the rock surfaces while steam distillation of crude oil light ends creates a small solvent bank that can miscibly remove trapped oil.\n\nThis method, also known as the Huff and Puff method, consists of 3 stages: injection, soaking, and production. Steam is first injected into a well for a certain amount of time to heat the oil in the surrounding reservoir to a recover approximately 20% of the Original Oil in Place (OOIP), compared to steam assisted gravity drainage, which has been reported to recover over 50% of OOIP. It is quite common for wells to be produced in the cyclic steam manner for a few cycles before being put on a steam flooding regime with other wells.\n\nThe mechanism proceeds through cycles of steam injection, soak, and oil production. First, steam is injected into a well at a temperature of 300 to 340° Celsius for a period of weeks to months. Next, the well is allowed to sit for days to weeks to allow heat to soak into the formation. Finally, the hot oil is pumped out of the well for a period of weeks or months. Once the production rate falls off, the well is put through another cycle of injection, soak and production. This process is repeated until the cost of injecting steam becomes higher than the money made from producing oil. The CSS method has the advantage that recovery factors are around 20 to 25% and the disadvantage that the cost to inject steam is high.\n\nCanadian Natural Resources use \"employs cyclic steam or \"huff and puff\" technology to develop bitumen resources. This technology requires one well bore and the production consists of the injection and production phases. First steam is \"injected for several weeks, mobilizing cold bitumen\". Then the flow \"on the injection well is reversed producing oil through the same injection well bore. The injection and production phases together comprise one cycle. \"Steam is re-injected to begin a new cycle when oil production rates fall below a critical threshold due to the cooling of the reservoir.\"\n\nIn a steam flood, sometimes known as a steam drive, some wells are used as steam injection wells and other wells are used for oil production. Two mechanisms are at work to improve the amount of oil recovered. The first is to heat the oil to higher temperatures and to thereby decrease its viscosity so that it more easily flows through the formation toward the producing wells. A second mechanism is the physical displacement employing in a manner similar to water flooding, in which oil is meant to be pushed to the production wells. While more steam is needed for this method than for the cyclic method, it is typically more effective at recovering a larger portion of the oil.\n\nA form of steam flooding that has become popular in the Alberta oil sands is steam assisted gravity drainage (SAGD), in which two horizontal wells are drilled, one a few meters above the other, and steam is injected into the upper one. The intent is to reduce the viscosity of the bitumen to the point where gravity will pull it down into the producing well.\n\nIn 2011 Laricina Energy combined solvent injection with steam injection in a process called solvent cyclic steam-assisted gravity drainage (SC-SAGD). Laricina claims that combining solvents with steam reduces the overall steam oil ratio for recovery by 30%.\n\nThe alternative to surface generated steam is downhole steam generation that reduces heat loss and generates high-quality steam in the reservoir that allows for more heavy oil and oil sands production at a faster rate. Downhole steam generators were first proposed by the major oil companies in the early 1960s. Over the last 50 years multiple downhole steam technologies have been developed such as the DOE and SANDIA downhole combustion system known as Project Deep Steam that was field tested in Long Beach, CA in 1982, but was a failure. The only downhole steam generator that has proved successful is branded as eSteam and is more fully described on its technology website at www.esteamoil.com.\n"}

Sugaring is the process of desiccating a food by first dehydrating it, then packing it with pure sugar. This sugar can be crystalline in the form of table or raw sugar, or it can be a high sugar density liquid such as honey, syrup or molasses.\n\nThe purpose of sugaring is to create an environment hostile to microbial life and prevent food spoilage. Sugaring is commonly used to preserve fruits as well as vegetables such as ginger. From time to time sugaring has also been used for non-food preservations. For example, honey was used as part of the mummification process in some ancient Egyptian rites.\n\nA risk in sugaring is that sugar itself attracts moisture. Once a sufficient moisture level is reached, native yeast in the environment will come out of dormancy and begin to ferment the sugars into alcohol and carbon dioxide. This leads to the process of fermentation. Although fermentation can be used as a food preservation method, it must be intentionally controlled, or the results will tend to be unpleasant.\n"}
{"id": "45341861", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=45341861", "title": "TEDOM", "text": "TEDOM\n\nTEDOM a.s is a Czech engineering company which was established by Ing. Josef Jeleček in Třebíč in 1991.TEDOM is an abbreviation of the Czech words TEplo DOMova [The warmth of home]. The primary scope of business of the company is the development and production of CHP (combined heat and power) units with gas combustion engines. Aside from CHP units, the company's product portfolio also includes a gas heat pump and combustion engines, all of them designed by TEDOM.\n\nAt its inception, TEDOM initially operated as a limited liability company. From 1994, a holding company had been gradually established where TEDOM held the leading position. In 2010, the holding company became a joint stock company, and TEDOM a.s. was created. Presently, TEDOM a.s. operates in more than 40 countries worldwide. In 2016, TEDOM acquired the German company of SCHNELL Motoren with the aim to lead with TEDOM products in the German market. In 2017 TEDOM established the TEDOM Group – a group of companies that share property with TEDOM. All members of the group deal with either development, production, installation or operation of CHP units.\n\nTEDOM was established as a limited liability company in 1991. It was established by Ing. Josef Jeleček. The scope of business for TEDOM s.r.o. from its beginning was the development, production and sales of CHP units with gas-piston combustion engines. The first CHP unit, the TEDOM MT 22 with an output of 22 kW that used the Škoda 781 four-cylinder spark-ignition engine from the Škoda Favorit-model series passenger car, was put into operation this same year.\n\nIn 1993, close cooperation was initiated with VKS s.r.o. in Hořovice. This company became the manufacturer of mechanical components for CHP units while TEDOM focused on the production of electrical parts and sales/regional service of CHP units. A new TEDOM MT 130A CHP unit type with an output of 130 kW was developed that year. This CHP unit model employed the model M630-series LIAZ 12-litre spark-ignition 6-cylinder engine (from the model LIAZ 100 truck).\n\nIn 1994, TEDOM started a gradual creation of a holding company. The first subsidiary was Třebíčská Tepelná Společnost s.r.o. This subsidiary leased and consequently started operation of the thermal and energy system in the town of Třebíč. The second subsidiary, TEPLO Ivančice s.r.o., responsible for the operation of the thermal system of the town of Ivančice, was established in 1996. The third subsidiary, Jesenická Tepelná Společnost s.r.o., which operates the thermal system in the town of Jesenice, was created in 1997. TEDOM Energo s.r.o. was established in 1999 (originally Příborská Tepelná Společnost s.r.o.). TEDOM Energo s.r.o. started to provide a majority of the activities associated with the production of power and heat within the Czech Republic. In 2000, an additional company, TENERGO Brno a.s. was founded. TENERGO Brno a.s. specialises in operating the thermal and energy systems in Slovakia. In 2003, TEDOM became a member of COGEN Europe (European Association for the Promotion of Cogeneration).\n\nIn 2000, individual products were innovated and the new product lines of Premi and CENTO were developed. In 2001, TEDOM oriented its focus on CHP units that operate on biogas. Following this move, a new series of TEDOM CHP units adapted to operate on biogas was introduced in 2002 and the new QUANTO product series was born.\n\nIn 2003, TEDOM acquired the JAMOT plant (an engine works plant in Jablonec) in an auction sale. It was a former facility of LIAZ s.r.o. in Jablonec nad Nisou. The engine manufacturing plant became an integral part of TEDOM s.r.o. as a separate motors division. Consequently, the production of low-floor city buses was started in 2004 and the TEDOM city bus prototype was introduced equipped with a TEDOM engine that burned compressed natural gas (CNG). The 1000th CHP unit made under the TEDOM mark was installed in the same year as well.\n\nIn 2005, a new product line of MICRO CHP units was introduced.\n\nIn 2006, the grand opening of a new TEDOM manufacturing plant for the assembly of low-floor city buses took place in Třebíč. Additionally, TEDOM continued to manufacture trucks and engines to modernise the 810-series railway vehicles into the 814-series motor units.\n\nIn 2008, the 2000th CHP unit of the TEDOM trademark was put into operation. Later in the same year, TEDOM Holding was divided into two parts: 25% of the assets passed to TTS Holding, the energy producer, and 75% of the assets remained in TEDOM Holding for the development and production of power engineering technologies. As agreed upon by the partners, TTS Holding was separated to the benefit of the exiting partner, Mr Richard Horký.; the transaction amounted to 60 million CZK. Since that time, TEDOM has focused exclusively on the production of technologies.\n\nIn 2010, a merger of the companies took place. The companies joined in the merger were TEDOM s.r.o., TEDOM ENERGO s.ro., TEDOM CHP s.r.o., Jesenická Tepelná Společnost s.r.o., and TEDOM Holding s.r.o., and the newly established joint stock company of TEDOM a.s.\n\nSince 2011, ČEZ Energo s.r.o. operates in the Czech market as the operator of a decentralized power plant. This plant currently comprises almost 100 CHP units with a total output of more than 72MW and it is jointly owned and operated by ČEZ a.s. and TEDOM a.s. The TEDOM share is 49.9%.\n\nIn 2012, the production of city buses was terminated. At the same time, a new product was developed – the POLO 100 gas heat pump that, in the following year, won the Innovation of the Year Award in the \"Czech Energy and Ecological Project\" competition. It was this same year that TEDOM entered into a contract with the leading Czech power engineering company of ČEZ for the delivery and service of CHP units: TEDOM agreed to deliver more than 100 CHP units with a total electrical output exceeding 100MW within a five-year period.\n\nIn 2013, the extensive foreign project in Sydney, was completed, where TEDOM built two trigeneration centres with a total electrical output of 11.8MW.\n\nIn 2016, TEDOM won 52nd place in the \"Czech Top 100\" competition of companies. In this competition, TEDOM has won its position in the top 100 companies consistently since 2013.\n\nIn 2016, TEDOM celebrated 25 years of operation and more than 3500 manufactured CHP units with the TEDOM trademark. In collaboration with American company Tecogen Inc., a joint venture of TTCogen was established to sell the TEDOM CHP units in US territory. TEDOM has a 50% share in TTCogen. The same year, TEDOM also acquired the German company SCHNELL Motoren – one of the leading manufacturers of CHP units intended predominantly for biogas plants. TEDOM took over the company assets and 300 employees of the manufacturing plant in Wangen, including an extensive service network. Also in the same year, TEDOM won an award from the HSBC Bank to become the winner of the HSBC International Business Award competition.\n\nIn 2017 TEDOM and other companies, that share property with TEDOM, started to act together within the TEDOM Group. Members of the TEDOM Group are: TEDOM a.s., Schnell GmbH and ČEZ energo s.r.o. Common goals of all group members are a mutual support while producing and operating energy-saving machines for the combined production of heat and power and a mutual cooperation on the global market.\n\nIn 2018 the TTCogen joint venture was terminated. TEDOM continues to operate in the US through its subsidiary TEDOM USA Inc.\n\nTEDOM's company structure is as follows:\n\nTEDOM has 4 branch offices in the Czech Republic:\n\nThe board of directors:\nSupervisory Board:\n\nSubsidiary companies:\nAffiliated companies:\n\nTEDOM specializes in export, production, installation and operation of CHP units. Furthermore, it offers the associated accessories and services.\n\nTEDOM offers CHP units in three product series: MICRO (up to 50 kW), CENTO (up to 500 kW), QUANTO (up to 10 MW). The products of each individual line are manufactured in two basic configurations: with an operation frequency of 50 Hertz (intended mostly for the European market) or 60 Hertz (intended mostly for the American market). Aside from natural gas, most of the CHP units are also capable of operating on biogas, landfill gas, or mine gas. The company offers CHP units in several versions depending on which environment the unit must operate in: a version without a sound enclosure (for installation into sound-proof areas), with a sound enclosure (for indoor installations), and a container version (for outdoor installations).\nCHP units are closely related to trigeneration units, but in addition to power and heat, the trigeneration units also produce cold energy. TEDOM included the trigeneration units in its portfolio as well.\n\nThe company additionally offers products associated with CHP unit operation (gas treatment plants, exhaust heat exchangers, economisers, and other related equipment).\nThe company also offers the TEDOM Polo 100 gas heat pump.\n\nAside from its own produced engines, TEDOM equips its CHP units with engines made by Kubota, Liebherr, MAN, MWM and Rolls Royce. \n\nIn 2004, TEDOM's Bus Division started production of a low-floor city bus driven by a natural gas engine. The company obtained the necessary know-how by buying the licence from the Italian manufacturer Mauri. Thus, in 2004 TEDOM became the third bus manufacturer in the Czech Republic after Karosa (Iveco Czech Republic since 2007) and SOR Libchavy. A new manufacturing plant was built in Třebíč in connection with these business activities. However, of the originally planned manufacture of a thousand pieces, the new manufacturing plant was able to produce no more than about 200 buses that were delivered mainly to the Czech Republic, Slovakia, Bulgaria, and Germany. Due to a lack of job orders, TEDOM decided to terminate bus production in January 2012.\n\nIn 2006, TEDOM Truck s.r.o. was created as a subsidiary company to TEDOM. This company followed up on the production of LIAZ trucks. Specifically, the LIAZ 300 and LIAZ 400 model. The necessary know-how came associated with the acquisition of the Jablonec engine works plant. The company started to sell trucks under the new TEDOM name. The portfolio offered trucks driven by either a diesel engine (TEDOM-D) or a gas engine (TEDOM-G). However, in total, the company delivered a mere 19 units during its entire existence, only to end up in liquidation as decided in a general meeting in 2009.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

The user usually sits on the bench, which straddles the side of the tub, and gradually slides from the outside to the inside of the tub. Tub transfer benches are used by people who have trouble getting over the tub wall or into the shower, either because of illness or disability.\n\nA basic transfer bench typically consists of a backrest, long seat, and four legs. The legs inside the tub sometimes have plungers at their base that grip the tub's surface for stability. There are many different kinds, customized for the patient's needs. The size, (usually adjustable) height, and width can all vary. The user gets on the seat from the outside of the tub and scoots over on the seat to the inside, lifting one leg at a time over the tub's side. \n\nVarious optional accessories are available, such as a padded seat, commode opening, support backrests, or swing-away armrests.\n\nThis varies from the transfer bench, in that instead of scooting to the other side, the user does not have to move their hips across the seat. The user simply sits on a seat and then slides to the other side, usually on rails or some kind of sliding frame. This reduces friction considerably and eases the movement for more highly dependent patients. \n\nShower or bath benches come in different lengths, along with such options as padded seats, swivel seats, and cut-out seats. \nSome are freestanding, while others attach to the side of the tub. There are also models that integrate with a wheeled chair, with the transfer frame in the tub connecting to the chair.\n\nA newly developed shower bench design has three sets of rails that dock together permitting a seated patient to roll from a mobile chair into a bathtub or shower. The first set of rails is part of a mobile chair and they sit below a detachable seat consisting of a seat rest, backrest, and optional armrests. The second rail set sits in the tub or shower and has a base similar to a common four-legged shower bench. The third set of rails are \"connecting rails\" that dock with the other two sets and creates a connecting bridge between them. \n\nTo use this type of shower bench, the caregivers first places the shower bench with rails in the bath or shower and stabilizes it. The caregiver then aligns the bridging rails with the shower bench's rails and locks them together using a cam lock. The next step is to roll the mobile chair (with seated patient) in position, and align and lock the mobile chair's rails with the bridge's rails (on the opposite side) again using a cam lock. Once the three sets of rails are connected, the caregiver can roll the chair (with the seated patient) over the rails laterally, off the wheeled base of the mobile chair, across the bridge, and into the shower or bath. The shower bench supports the seated patient and chair during bathing or showering.\n\nThe bridge rails and wheeled base can then be disconnected and moved away so the caregiver can have unobstructed access to the patient for bathing. When bathing is finished, the reverse process moves the patient from the bath back into the mobile chair. \n\nShower benches are often used in conjunction with a patient lift for highly dependent patients who cannot be manually moved from a wheelchair to the shower bench. In this case, the patient is hoisted in the sling-lift from a wheelchair or stretcher and seated on the shower bench so that they can then slide into the bath or shower.\n"}

{"id": "51872940", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=51872940", "title": "Watermills on Zala River", "text": "Watermills on Zala River\n\nFor centuries, the watermills on the Zala river (Zala County, Western Transdanubia, Hungary) had co-existed in a single harmonious unity with each other as well as with the river, the Zala valley and Zala meadow, both latter ones renowned for their beauty. Landscape rehabilitation would indeed be necessary because due to the closure of the mills and the destruction of the sluices, the level of the ground water in the meadows, usually having very loamy soil, has dramatically decreased, which has had detrimental impacts on the condition of the meadows. The declining tendency in the grassland culture hasn’t helped either. What is more, in several cases parts of the meadows were turned into arable lands or industrial sites. The final blow to the deteriorating meadows that gradually grew characterless was dealt by the disgraceful regulation of the river Zala (rather meaning its canalisation) in the beginning of the 1960s (Izsák 2016). A further station of the process was the elimination of the mills from the life of the river for all. \n„There were about 200 known steam mills and watermills in the county Zala at the end of the 1800s (the territory of the county was much larger at that time though)(Molnár 2015). According to the statistical data of the Zala county archives of the year 1949, there were about 180 mills in operation in the county then (140 of which located in the county’s present, smaller territory). In the beginning of the 1940s, there were still about 37 mills grinding on the river Zala (Izsák and Kummer 2011). \nOne can still find water in some old mill-ponds. For the history of a miller's family see Jakosa 2011, 2012, both in Hungarian). These ponds provide suitable habitat for some aquatic organisms. As for the history of the published data and photos, I. Hajdu, J. Izsák, Á. Jakosa, Gy. Kummer and Mrs. M. Marx, the latter working with Göcseji Muzeum, Zalaegerszeg decided in 2004 to start gathering documents and data systematically on the watermills along the river Zala. We have based our selection of the mills to be presented on a list from the year 1949 preserved in the Zala-county archives. The chart was provided by Mr. Gy. Kummer. A significant number of the photos were also taken by him. The mills indicated by red characters exist today mainly in documents and in the mind's eye only. For the possibility of hydropower by the water of small rivers, e.g. Zala, see Gerse 2014.\n\nBy sluice („barrage”), usually the full sluice system as well as the sluice gates themselves were referred to in live speech. The couple-of-hundred-meter-long section of the river above the mills that can be swollen by (wooden) sluice gates is called the head race. The river banks right above the sluice gate were often protected by concrete walls from erosion. On this river section, the lowered sluice gate barred and „swelled” or „held” water behind it as one of the preparatory steps of grinding. By the way, the higher or lower position of the sluice before the turbine chamber and before the run-out to the mill-pond, one could control the volume of the water running through the turbine chamber to rotate the turbine. This latter ensured the energy necessary for milling. When grinding, the water was let out to flow onto the turbine encased in the turbine chamber protected by a lattice. From thereon, the water left the turbine chamber via its outlet into the mill pit. (Driftwood and other debris were cleared from the lattice by a rake.) Of course, in the meantime, the water level in the head race continuously decreased as the water was „let out” or „released”. Sluice gates could be raised or let down by specific iron structures. Directly above the sluice gate, practically annexed to it stood the sluice bridge that made it possible to get close to the sluice gates. One could also cross the river using this little bridge. There also used to be a larger bridge on the head race suited for the transportation of grains and flour, but it had usually been ruined by the 1950s and 1960s. During swelling, if the water level in the head race reached the upper edge of the lowered sluice gate, the water cascaded over it, and showered onto a concrete surface producing characteristic sounds, and then rushed into the wide and (3-to-8-meter) deep mill pit. The mill pit was used to be called mill pond in other locations. The expressions appearing in this paragraph aren’t uniformly used anyway. It is certain though that the anglers in Zalaegerszeg used these terms in the 1950s. At the lower end of the mill pit that narrowed again, usually a crescent-shaped gravel islet formed. The following outflow section was shallow, and continuously deepened again. The water often meandered along an extended tract, flowing ever slower, and getting ever deeper, to become the head race of the following mill. In some cases, the river was bifurcated above the mill by digging a new branch leading to the mill (and serving as its „head race” or „leat”). On the other branch („small branch) there was also a sluice called „small sluice”. (If I remember well, the related smaller „mill pond” was also called a small pond by the anglers in the past.) By the sluice, one could control the amount of water flowing towards the main branch of the river. The small pond located behind the small sluice flowed into the small branch to rejoin the main branch after about 100 to 200 meters. As far as I recall, small branches and small sluices could only be found in Zalaegerszeg or further downward on the river Zala (but not even there in all the cases: e.g. in the 50’s the Baumgartner mill in Zalaegerszeg didn’t feature a small sluice). In the riverbed hollows or incavations could form while in other tracts the water was shallow and running. During floods, everything got messed up: in the stead of the river Zala and its meadow, a spectacular, uninterrupted expanse of water appeared that a few days later receded. \nIn several comments, we refer to piles sticking out from or standing in the water in the immediate vicinity of the mills. The corner of the mill closest to the water was often supported by such a pile. In other cases, the piles upheld a proper planking above the water. Standing on such a planking, one could do maintenance work on the sluice gates, e.g. defrost them. But similar piles may also be remains of old-time wooden bridges. \nThe structure equipped with its own little roof and window often raised on top of the mill building is the ventage of the powder-house, but it could also be used to accommodate the protruding end of the elevator. One could often see a „rain panel” sticking out above the door of the building that protected the people and the sacs from the rain during loading. The by-products of grinding could be used to feed pigs and poultry. Therefore, apart from the stable housing the work-horses, there were often piggeries, henneries or even pigeonries in the vicinity of the mills.\n\nThe mills below are referred to primarily by their location, secondarily by their popular name(s). The latter one usually coincides with the name of the last owner or sometimes with that of the tenant. \nIn several cases, the mill ponds even today retain significant amounts of water. One of the potential reasons is that in the old days, springlets surviving up to the present emerged at the bottom of the then several-meter-deep water.\n\n"}

The male and female figures ride on a balance bar, which is suspended by a piece of catgut or hair. The gut relaxes or shrinks based on the humidity in the surrounding air, relaxing when the air is wet and tensing when the air is dry. This action swings one figure or the other out of the house depending on the humidity. Some variants function as a barometer: low pressure indicates wrong (rainy) weather, high pressure good (sunny) weather. \n\nWeather houses are associated in the popular mind with Austria, Germany or Switzerland, and are often decorated in the style of a cuckoo clock. Many weather houses also bear a small thermometer on the part between the two doors that conceals the gut suspension, and many also contain a piggy bank. In contrast, the term \"weather house\" in the United States refers to buildings built by the U. S. Signal Service and then the U. S.
