To achieve this mission, they work to increase scientific literacy through public engagement, advocate for science and equity, and provide self-identifying women with the tools and support they need to reach their full potential. The organization began with an open letter in November 2016 and was officially recognized as a 501(c)3 in May 2018. \n\n500 Women Scientists launched with an open letter signed by 500 women scientists after the United States 2016 presidential election. The letter pledged to speak out not only against policies that go against scientific evidence, but also against inequality, sexism, xenophobia, and other forms of discrimination against marginalized communities. Within two months, the pledge received over fifteen thousand signatures from women and allies in 109 countries. \n\nIn concert with the 2017 Women's March, women scientists and supporters who signed the pledge organized themselves into groups to march together. The local marches became the basis for forming local chapters, or \"Pods\", where local women scientists meet regularly. Pods function both as a support system and as a vehicle to focus on and organize around issues that resonate in their own communities, in line with 500 Women Scientists core mission and values. \n\nTo increase representation of women on conference panels and in high-profile science journalism stories, 500 Women Scientists launched a Request a Woman Scientist database for self-identifying women with expertise in STEMM (science, technology, engineering, mathematics, and medicine) fields. The database currently contains over 6,000 women in 104 countries.\n\n500 Women Scientists often uses science writing as a means of communicating their expertise and values to the public at large, with pieces featured in outlets like \"Science\", \"Scientific American\", and \"The Seattle Times\". The global leadership team has authored a number of opinion pieces on topics as varied as calling for evidence-based policy-making at the Environmental Protection Agency, recommending policy reforms to combat sexual harassment in academia, and encouraging journal editors to think carefully about fostering equity and inclusion in their editorial pages. Local Pods have also written about issues facing their own communities, ranging from the effect of President Trump's border wall on California wildlife the need to stop burning coal in the Puget Sound.\n\n"}
{"id": "186712", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=186712", "title": "Agricultural productivity", "text": "Agricultural productivity\n\nAgricultural productivity is measured as the ratio of agricultural outputs to agricultural inputs. While individual products are usually measured by weight, their varying densities make measuring overall agricultural output difficult. Therefore, output is usually measured as the market value of final output, which excludes intermediate products such as corn feed used in the meat industry. This output value may be compared to many different types of inputs such as labour and land (yield). These are called partial measures of productivity.\n\nAgricultural productivity may also be measured by what is termed total factor productivity (TFP). This method of calculating agricultural productivity compares an index of agricultural inputs to an index of outputs. This measure of agricultural productivity was established to remedy the shortcomings of the partial measures of productivity; notably that it is often hard to identify the factors cause them to change. Changes in TFP are usually attributed to technological improvements.\n\nSome sources of agricultural productivity are:\n\nSee: Productivity improving technologies (historical) Section: 2.4.1: Mechanization: Agriculture, Section 2.6: Scientific agriculture.\n\nThe productivity of a region's farms is important for many reasons. Aside from providing more food, increasing the productivity of farms affects the region's prospects for growth and competitiveness on the agricultural market, income distribution and savings, and labour migration. An increase in a region's agricultural productivity implies a more efficient distribution of scarce resources. As farmers adopt new techniques and differences, the more productive farmers benefit from an increase in their welfare while farmers who are not productive enough will exit the market to seek success elsewhere.\n\nAs a region's farms become more productive, its comparative advantage in agricultural products increases, which means that it can produce these products at a lower opportunity cost than can other regions. Therefore, the region becomes more competitive on the world market, which means that it can attract more consumers since they are able to buy more of the products offered for the same amount of money.\n\nIncreases in agricultural productivity lead also to agricultural growth and can help to alleviate poverty in poor and developing countries, where agriculture often employs the greatest portion of the population. As farms become more productive, the wages earned by those who work in agriculture increase. At the same time, food prices decrease and food supplies become more stable. Labourers therefore have more money to spend on food as well as other products. This also leads to agricultural growth. People see that there is a greater opportunity to earn their living by farming and are attracted to agriculture either as owners of farms themselves or as labourers. \n\nHowever, it is not only the people employed in agriculture who benefit from increases in agricultural productivity. Those employed in other sectors also enjoy lower food prices and a more stable food supply. Their wages may also increase.\n\nAgricultural productivity is becoming increasingly important as the world population continues to grow. India, one of the world's most populous countries, has taken steps in the past decades to increase its land productivity. Forty years ago, North India produced only wheat, but with the advent of the earlier maturing high-yielding wheats and rices, the wheat could be harvested in time to plant rice. This wheat/rice combination is now widely used throughout the Punjab, Haryana, and parts of Uttar Pradesh. The wheat yield of three tons and rice yield of two tons combine for five tons of grain per hectare, helping to feed India's 1.1 billion people. \n\nIncrease in agricultural productivity is often linked with questions about sustainability and sustainable development. Changes in agricultural practices necessarily bring changes in demands on resources. This means that as regions implement measures to increase the productivity of their farm land, they must also find ways to ensure that future generations will also have the resources they will need to live and thrive.\n\nBetween 1950 and 2000, during the so-called \"second agricultural revolution of modern times\", U.S. agricultural productivity rose fast, especially due to the development of new technologies. For example, the average amount of milk produced per cow increased from 5,314 pounds to 18,201 pounds per year (+242%), the average yield of corn rose from 39 bushels to 153 bushels per acre (+292%), and each farmer in 2000 produced on average 12 times as much farm output per hour worked as a farmer did in 1950.\n\nFor many farmers (especially in non-industrial countries) agricultural productivity may mean much more. A productive farm is one that provides most of the resources necessary for the farmer's family to live, such as food, fuel, fiber, healing plants, etc. It is a farm which ensures food security as well as a way to sustain the well-being of a community. This implies that a productive farm is also one which is able to ensure proper management of natural resources, such as biodiversity, soil, water, etc. For most farmers, a productive farm would also produce more goods than required for the community in order to allow trade.\n\nDiversity in agricultural production is one key to productivity, as it enables risk management and preserves potentials for adaptation and change. Monoculture is an example of such a nondiverse production system. In a monocultural system a farmer may produce only crops, but no livestock, or only livestock and no crop.\n\nThe benefits of raising livestock, among others, are that it provides multiple goods, such as food, wool, hides, and transportation. It also has an important value in term of social relationships (such as gifts in weddings). In case of famine, when crops are not sufficient to ensure food safety, livestock can be used as food. Livestock may also provide manure, which can be used to fertilize cultivated soils, which increases soil productivity. On the other hand, in an agricultural system based only on raising livestock, food has to be bought from other farmers, and wastes produced cannot be easily disposed of.\nProduction has many functions, and diversity is the foundation of such production. To ignore the complex functions provided by a farm is thought by many to turn agricultural production into a commodity.\n\n\n"}

The packaging included a code to unlock exclusive game content on the Barbie website. Female engineers including Betty Shanahan, CEO of the Society of Women Engineers, and Alice Agogino of the National Academy of Engineering were consulted on her wardrobe and work environment. They suggested that for authenticity she needed \"a Coke can and a bag of Doritos\" on her desk; she has a coffee cup. One mockup also included a Linux penguin; Barbie is running Linux on her dual-monitor set-up.\n\nIn 2010 Mattel invited people to vote for Barbie's 126th career, the first instance of this in the company's history. Voters were able to choose between five choices: computer engineer, architect, environmentalist, news anchor, and surgeon. Although girls preferred news anchor, computer engineer was the most popular choice in online polling, partly because of promotion by the Society of Women Engineers. The two dolls were launched together at the 2010 American International Toy Fair.\n\nMany writers for tech publications and other reviewers were encouraged by the choice of career, hoping it would encourage girls to consider careers in computer science. However, the amount of pink, the hairstyle, and the stylish clothes struck some women as unrealistic and stereotyped.\n\nThe accompanying book, \"I Can Be a Computer Engineer\", was issued in 2013 together with \"I Can Be an Actress\". The book received extensive criticism, especially beginning in November 2014, for depicting Barbie as relying on two male friends to program the game she is designing. In addition, they need to help her after she accidentally infects her and her sister Skipper's computers with a virus (via the pink heart-shaped USB stick she wears around her neck), after ignoring advice from her (female) computer teacher. \n\nA website was created to enable people to replace segments of the book's text with their own, and Mattel pulled the title from Amazon after many critical reviews. The publisher stated it was being discontinued. A Mattel spokesperson said that the book had first been published in 2010 and was outdated, and the company apologized. The book's Barbie says she's \"only creating the design ideas\" and that her two male friends will have to do the coding; the author, who proclaimed herself a feminist, said her assignment had been to portray Barbie as a designer and \"regrets that she may have let stereotypes slip into the book\".\n\nIn response to the complaints of the book Mattel posted an apology on their official Facebook page for Barbie, stating that the \"portrayal of Barbie in this specific story doesn't reflect the Brand's vision for what Barbie stands for.\"\n"}

Components of a converged infrastructure may include servers, data storage devices, networking equipment and software for IT infrastructure management, automation and orchestration.\n\nIT organizations use converged infrastructure to centralize the management of IT resources, to consolidate systems, to increase resource-utilization rates, and to lower costs. Converged infrastructures foster these objectives by implementing pools of computers, storage and networking resources that can be shared by multiple applications and managed in a collective manner using policy-driven processes.\n\nIT vendors and IT industry analysts use various terms to describe the concept of a converged infrastructure. These include \"converged system\", \"unified computing\", \"fabric-based computing\", and \"dynamic infrastructure\".\n\nHistorically, to keep pace with the growth of business applications and the terabytes of data they generate, IT resources were deployed in a silo-like fashion. One set of resources has been devoted to one particular computing technology, business application or line of business. These resources support a single set of assumptions and cannot be optimized or reconfigured to support varying usage loads.\n\nThe proliferation of IT sprawl in data centers has contributed to rising operations costs, reducing productivity, and stifling agility and flexibility. Maintenance and operations can consume two-thirds of an organization’s technology budget, according to a 2009 InformationWeek survey of executives in 500 companies with annual revenue over $250 million. That leaves just a third of the budget for new IT initiatives. This ratio prevents IT from supporting new business initiatives or responding to real application demands.\n\nA converged infrastructure addresses the problem of siloed architectures and IT sprawl by pooling and sharing IT resources. Rather than dedicating a set of resources to a particular computing technology, application or line of business, converged infrastructure creates a pool of virtualized servers, storage and networking capacity that is shared by multiple applications and lines of business.\n\nConverged infrastructure provides both technical and business efficiencies, according to industry researchers and observers. These gains stem in part from the pre-integration of technology components, the pooling of IT resources and the automation of IT processes. Converged infrastructure further contributes to efficient data centers by enhancing the ability of cloud computing systems to handle enormous data sets, using only a single integrated IT management system \n\nWriting in \"CIO magazine\", Forrester Research analyst Robert Whiteley noted that converged infrastructures, combining server, storage, and networks into a single framework, help to transform the economics [of] running the datacenter thus accelerating the transition to IP storage to help build infrastructures that are \"cloud-ready\". The combination of storage and compute into a single entity is known as converged storage.\n\nDecreased complexity, through the use of pre-integrated hardware with virtualization and automation management tools, is another important value proposition for converged infrastructure as noted in an IDC study.\n\nIn April 2012, the open source analyst firm Wikibon released the first market forecast for converged infrastructure, with a projected $402B total available market (TAM) by 2017 of which, nearly 2/3rds of the infrastructure that supports enterprise applications will be packaged in some type of converged solution by 2017.\n\nInformationWeek highlighted the promise of two long-term advantages of a unified data center infrastructure: \n\nData centers around the world are reaching limits in power, cooling and space. At the same time, capital constraints are requiring organizations to rethink data center strategy. Converged infrastructure offers a solution to these challenges.\n\nConverged infrastructure can serve as an enabling platform for private and public cloud computing services, including infrastructure as a service (IaaS), platform as a service (PaaS), and software as a service (SaaS) offerings.\n\nSeveral characteristics make converged infrastructure well suited to cloud deployments. These include the ability to pool IT resources, to automate resource provisioning and to scale up and down capacity quickly to meet the needs of dynamic computing workloads.\n\n"}
{"id": "399551", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=399551", "title": "Cutlery", "text": "Cutlery\n\nCutlery includes any hand implement used in preparing, serving, and especially eating food in Western culture. A person who makes or sells cutlery is called a cutler. The city of Sheffield in England has been famous for the production of cutlery since the 17th century and a train – the \"Master Cutler\" – running from Sheffield to London was named after the industry.\n\nCutlery is more usually known as silverware or flatware in the United States, where \"cutlery\" usually means knives and related cutting instruments. Although the term \"silverware\" is used irrespective of the material composition of the utensils, the term \"tableware\" has come into use to avoid the implication that they are made of silver.\n\nThe major items of cutlery in Western culture are the knife, fork and spoon. In recent times, hybrid versions of cutlery have been made combining the functionality of different eating implements, including the spork (spoon / fork), spife (spoon / knife), and knork (knife / fork) or the sporf which combines all three.\n\nThe word cutler derives from the Middle English word 'cuteler' and this in turn derives from Old French 'coutelier' which comes from 'coutel'; meaning knife (modern French: couteau). The word's early origins can be seen in the Latin word 'culter' (knife).\n\nThe first documented use of the term \"cutler\" in Sheffield appeared in a 1297 tax return. A Sheffield knife was listed in the King's possession in the Tower of London fifty years later. Several knives dating from the 14th century are on display at the Cutlers' Hall in Sheffield.\n\nSterling silver is the traditional material from which good quality cutlery is made (hence the usage of the term in the United States). Historically, silver had the advantage over other metals of being less chemically reactive. Chemical reactions between certain foods and the cutlery metal can lead to unpleasant tastes. Gold is even less reactive than silver, but the use of gold cutlery was confined to the exceptionally wealthy, such as monarchs.\n\nEven comparatively modest households might have one or two items of silver, often silver spoons. Wealthy individuals would own large sets containing a range of specialised dining implements, such as the comprehensive set in sterling silver made for the French aristocrat Marie-Joseph Paul Yves Roch Gilbert du Motier (known as the Marquis de Lafayette) by the Towle Manufacturing Company. It contained, among many other items, a gravy ladle, mustard spoon and lettuce fork.\n\nSteel was always used for more utilitarian knives, and pewter was used for some cheaper items, especially spoons. From the nineteenth century, electroplated nickel silver (EPNS) was used as a cheaper substitute for sterling silver.\n\nIn 1913, the British metallurgist Harry Brearley discovered stainless steel by chance and this metal has come to be the predominant one used in cutlery. An alternative is melchior, corrosion-resistant nickel and copper alloy, which can also sometimes contain manganese and nickel-iron.\n\nPlastic cutlery is made for disposable use, and is frequently used outdoors for camping, excursions, and barbecues for instance. Plastic cutlery is also commonly used at fast-food or take-away outlets and provided with airline meals in economy class.\nPlastic is also used for children's cutlery. It is often thicker and more durable than disposable plastic cutlery. \nWooden disposable cutlery is also available as a biodegradable alternative.\n\nCutlery has been made in many places. In Britain, the industry became concentrated by the late 16th century in and around Birmingham and Sheffield. However, the Birmingham industry increasingly concentrated on swords, made by \"long cutlers\", and on other edged tools, whereas the Sheffield industry concentrated on knives.\n\nAt Sheffield the trade of cutler became divided, with allied trades such as razormaker, awlbladesmith, shearsmith and forkmaker emerging and becoming distinct trades by the 18th century.\n\nBefore the mid 19th century when cheap mild steel became available due to new methods of steelmaking, knives (and other edged tools) were made by welding a strip of steel on to the piece of iron that was to be formed into a knife, or sandwiching a strip of steel between two pieces of iron. This was done because steel was then a much more expensive commodity than iron. Modern blades are sometimes laminated, but for a different reason. Since the hardest steel is brittle, a layer of hard steel may be laid between two layers of a milder, less brittle steel, for a blade that keeps a sharp edge well, and is less likely to break in service.\n\nAfter fabrication, the knife had to be sharpened, originally on a grindstone, but from the late medieval period in a blade mill or (as they were known in the Sheffield region) a cutlers wheel.\n\nIntroduced for convenience purposes (lightweight, no cleanup after the meal required), disposable cutlery made of plastic has become a huge worldwide market. Along with other disposable tableware (paper plates, plastic table covers, disposable cups, paper napkins, etc.), these products have become essential for the fast food and catering industry. The products are emblematic of throw-away societies and the cause of millions of tons of non-biodegradable plastic waste.\n\nTraditional centres of cutlery-making include:\n\n\n\n"}

Unlike the compact-disc technology it is based on, DDCD was designed exclusively for data with no audio capabilities. \n\nFor a 12 cm disc, it doubles the original 650 MB to 1.3 GB capacity of a CD on recordable (DDCD-R) and rewritable (DDCD-RW) discs by narrowing the track pitch from 1.6 to 1.1 micrometers, and shortening the minimum pit length from 0.833 to 0.623 micrometer. The DDCD was also available in read-only format (DDCD-ROM). The specification allowed for both 12 cm and 8 cm discs, although it appears no 8 cm media was ever released.\n\nThe technology, released years after rewritable DVD technology, failed to acquire significant market share. The only DDCD recorder introduced was the Sony CRX200E. While the initial launch price of the drive and the disc ($249 and $2-3 respectively) was lower than the prices of DVD-RW drives and media ($1000 and $10 respectively), an 85% increase in storage compared to the standard 700 MB CDs was not enough to entice customers. DVD offered a significantly higher capacity - nearly four times more than DDCD-R with 4.7 GB on single layer discs and six and a half times more with 8.5 GB on double layer discs and would drop significantly in cost in the years after DDCD's launch.\n\nThe DDCD technology was marked as 'legacy' in the 2006-edition of the SCSI Multimedia Commands set (MMC).\n\nDDCD was part of a wave of technologies aimed at enhancing the compact disc, none of which managed to gain much marketshare.\n\nMultiLevel Recording, developed in 1992 by Optex Corporation, was a proposed technology that never saw the light of the day. It promised to burn 2 GB onto one CD and a couple of disc burners from TDK and Plextor were set for release in 2002 for $200 with discs costing around $2. No ML products were ever released. \n\nIn September 2002, Sanyo announced it had achieved the same result as DDCD using standard CD-Rs with its HD-Burn technology. This allowed users to burn 1.4 GB on a standard 700 MB CD. However, the resulting CD could only be played back on DVD drives.\n\nIn 2003, Plextor released a CD burner that utilized their proprietary GigaRec technology to allow users to burn a maximum of 980 MB on a standard 80 minute CD and 1.2 GB of a 99 minute CD. Like DDCD, the result was achieved by burning smaller pits. The resulting disc could be read perfectly on Plextor GigaRec drive.

This is also known as double pumped, dual-pumped, and double transition. The term toggle mode is used in the context of NAND flash memory.\n\nThe simplest way to design a clocked electronic circuit is to make it perform one transfer per full cycle (rise and fall) of a clock signal. This, however, requires that the clock signal changes twice per transfer, while the data lines change at most once per transfer. When operating at a high bandwidth, signal integrity limitations constrain the clock frequency. By using both edges of the clock, the data signals operate with the same limiting frequency, thereby doubling the data transmission rate.\n\nThis technique has been used for microprocessor front side busses, Ultra-3 SCSI, graphics RAM (the AGP bus and GDDR), main memory (both RDRAM and DDR1 through DDR4), and the HyperTransport bus on AMD's Athlon 64 processors. It is more recently being used for other systems with high data transfer speed requirements as an example, for the output of analog-to-digital converters (ADCs).\n\nDDR should not be confused with dual channel, in which each memory channel accesses two RAM modules simultaneously. The two technologies are independent of each other and many motherboards use both, by using DDR memory in a dual channel configuration.\n\nAn alternative to double or quad pumping is to make the link self-clocking. This tactic was chosen by InfiniBand and PCI Express.\n\nDescribing the bandwidth of a double-pumped bus can be confusing. Each clock edge is referred to as a \"beat\", with two beats (one upbeat and one downbeat) per cycle. Technically, the hertz is a unit of \"cycles\" per second, but many people refer to the number of \"transfers\" per second. Careful usage generally talks about \"500 MHz, double data rate\" or \"1000 MT/s\", but many refer casually to a \"1000 MHz bus,\" even though no signal cycles faster than 500 MHz.\n\nDDR SDRAM popularized the technique of referring to the bus bandwidth in megabytes per second, the product of the transfer rate and the bus width in bytes. DDR SDRAM operating with a 100 MHz clock is called DDR-200 (after its 200 MT/s data transfer rate), and a 64-bit (8-byte) wide DIMM operated at that data rate is called PC-1600, after its 1600 MB/s peak (theoretical) bandwidth. Likewise, 1.6 GT/s transfer rate DDR3-1600 is called PC3-12800.\n\nSome examples of popular designations of DDR modules:\nDDR SDRAM uses double-data-rate signalling only on the data lines. Address and control signals are still sent to the DRAM once per clock \"cycle\" (to be precise, on the rising edge of the clock), and timing parameters such as CAS latency are specified in clock cycles. Some less common DRAM interfaces, notably LPDDR2, GDDR5 and XDR DRAM, send commands and addresses using double data rate.\n\n"}

{"id": "923893", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=923893", "title": "Giro", "text": "Giro\n\nA giro (), or giro transfer, is a payment transfer from one bank account to another bank account and instigated by the payer, not the payee. The debit card has a similar model. Giros are primarily a European phenomenon; although electronic payment systems such as the Automated Clearing House exist in the United States and Canada, it is not possible to perform third party transfers with them. In the European Union, there is the Single Euro Payments Area (SEPA) which allows electronic giro or debit card payment to be executed to any bank in the area.\n\nIn the United Kingdom and in other countries the term giro may refer to a specific system once operated by the post office. In the UK, the giro service was originally known as National Giro. In due course \"giro\" was adopted by the public and the press as a shorthand term for the girocheque, which was a cheque and not a credit transfer. Meanwhile, there were \"Bank Giro Credits\", which were instructions to credit a particular bank account: these were not instructions to debit another account, so they had to be accompanied with cash or cheques, and they could be used both for bill payments and as paying-in slips; when used for paying bills they were often free-of-charge to the payer when used at the payer's or payee's bank but with an administration charge at other banks.\n\nThe use of cheques and paper giros is now in decline in many countries in favour of electronic payments, which are thought to be faster, cheaper and safer due to the reduced risk of fraud.\n\nThe word 'Giro' is also used in Investment Giro, where 'Giro' is used for a non-bank, administrative account on which investments and transactions are registered.\n\nThe word Giro in this context has its origine in the Netherlands. Giro is used in names like: Investment Giro, Investor Giro, Securities Giro, and in Dutch for , Beleggingsgiro and is used as synonymous for Investments or Investors administrations,Transfer Agents Services or for the Dutch 'Bewaarinstelling'. Read More Investment Giro\n\nThe word \"giro\" is borrowed from Dutch \"giro\" and/or German \"giro\", which are both from Italian \"giro\" meaning \"circulation of money\". The Italian term comes via Latin \"gyrus\" meaning \"gyre\" from the Greek \"gyros\" meaning \"circle\".\n\nGiro systems date back at least to Ptolemaic Egypt in the 4th century BC. State granary deposits functioned as an early banking system, in which giro payments were accepted, with a central bank in Alexandria. Giro was a common method of money transfer in early banking.\n\nThe first occurrences of book money are not known exactly. The giro system itself can be traced back to the \"bancherii\" in Northern Italy, especially on the Rialto (a financial center, resembling the modern day Wall Street). Originally these were money changers sitting at their desk (\"bancus\" = bench) that customers could turn to. They offered an additional service to keep the money and to allow direct transfer from one money store to another by checking the accounts in their storage books. Literally they opened one book, withdrew an amount, opened another book where the amount was added. This handling was naturally a very regional system but it allowed the money to circulate in the books. This led finally to the foundation of the \"Banco del Giro\" in 1619 (in Venetian language, Banco del Ziro) which gave the blueprint for similar banking systems. The usage in German language can be seen in the Banco del Giro founded in Vienna in 1703 (to extend the financing business that Samuel Oppenheimer had brought from Venice in 1670).\n\nPostal giro or postgiro systems have a long history in European financial services. The basic concept is that of a banking system not based on cheques, but rather by direct transfer between accounts. If the accounting office is centralised, then transfers between accounts can happen simultaneously. Money could be paid in or withdrawn from the system at any post office, and later connections to the commercial banking systems were established, often simply by the local bank opening its own postgiro account.\n\nBy the middle of the 20th century, most countries in continental Europe had a postal giro service. The first postgiro system was established in Austria on the early 19th century. By the time the British postgiro was conceived, the Dutch postgiro was very well established with virtually every adult having a postgiro account, and very large and well used postgiro operations in most other countries in Europe. Banks also adopted the giro as a method of direct payment from remitter to receiver.\n\nThe term \"bank\" was not used initially to describe the service. The banks' main payment instrument was based on the cheque which has a totally different remittance model than that of a giro.\n\nIn the banking model, cheques are written by the paying party and then handed or mailed to the payee, who must then visit a bank or mail the cheque to his or her bank. The cheque must then be cleared, a complex process by which cheques are sorted once, mailed to a central clearing location, sorted again, and then mailed back to the paying branch, which verifies that the funds are available and pays the payee's bank.\n\nIn the postal giro model, the paying party sends a request to pay the payee (called a giro transfer) to the giro centre, which verifies that the funds are available, debits the payer's accounts by the amount requested, and credits that amount to the payee's account. The giro centre then sends the giro transfer document to the recipient, and an updated account statement to both the payer and payee. In the case of large utilities receiving thousands of payments per day, statements are sent electronically and incorporate a unique reference number for each payment for reconciliation purposes.\n\nIn the United States, the rise of electronic cheque clearing (and debit cards as preferred instruments of payment) has made this difference less important than it once was. In some stores in the United States checks are scanned at the cash register and handed back to the customer. The scanned information is forwarded to a payment processor, which transfers the money using the ACH Network.\n\nUnlike the banking model, the postal giro model allows an individual to transfer money directly into another individual's bank account, provided the sender has the recipient's account details. The recipient is not required to approve or acknowledge the transfer or visit the bank to claim it. As a result, cheques are rarely used in countries with extensive giro networks, such as Germany, the Netherlands, Belgium and the Nordic countries.\n\nDirect deposit systems such as those in common use in North America, by contrast, require the recipient's explicit approval, typically provided by filling out a form. Transferring funds from one personal bank account to another typically requires either a physical check or a wire transfer, which may incur a significant fee and require the paying party to visit the bank.\n\nThe credit risk with respect to the actual transfer of physical currency is assumed by the giro operators, such as banks, as interbank credit risk. For the payer and payee, giro does not involve credit, unlike cheques or credit cards. This is both an advantage and a disadvantage. The creditworthiness of the payer doesn't need to be evaluated, as he can initiate the transaction only if he already has sufficient funds. As such, the payer doesn't have the benefit of paying on credit. However, the disadvantage is that the transactions are unsecured. The payer lacks the sort of protections against dishonest payees that come with credit cards. Transactions cannot be recalled or disputed after the fact. Thus, committing fraud in e.g. interpersonal trade is relatively easy, and giro payments should be only made to known and trusted payees. Also, even though intra-bank transfer can be quick, interbank transfers can take several days, and they are often executed only on business days.\n\nModern electronic bill payment is similar to the use of giro.\n\nAdvantages include:\n\nIn the United States, the ACH Network, regulated by NACHA and the Federal Reserve Bank, handles all interbank transfers, including direct deposit and direct debit.\n\nIn entirely electronic bill payment, the payer receives a bill — either physically by mail or electronically from a website (electronic billing). Then, the payer reads in the information from the bill, either manually or by using the barcode on the bill (ex: EPC QR Code in the European Union), enters it to the form on the bank website, and submits the form. The payment is immediately deducted from the account balance.\n\nBefore the use of electronic transfers of payments became the norm in the United Kingdom the fortnightly \"giro\" payment was the normal way of distributing benefit payments. When unemployment peaked in the 1980s, large numbers of people would receive their benefit payment on the same day leading the concept of \"Giro Day\", marked by the settlement of small debts and a noticeable increase in drinking, partying, and festive activities. It is the focus of the 1996 film \"Waiting for Giro\".\n\n"}
{"id": "203237", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=203237", "title": "Halliburton", "text": "Halliburton\n\nHalliburton Company is an American multinational corporation. One of the world's largest oil field service companies, it has operations in more than 70 countries. It owns hundreds of subsidiaries, affiliates, branches, brands, and divisions worldwide and employs approximately 55,000 people.\n\nThe company has dual headquarters located in Houston and in Dubai, and it remains incorporated in the United States.\n\nHalliburton's major business segment is the Energy Services Group (ESG). It offers a broad array of products and services to upstream oil and gas customers worldwide through fourteen product service lines: Artificial Lift, Cementing, Completion Tools, Multi-Chem, Pipeline & Process Services, Production Enhancement, Production Solutions, Baroid, Drill Bits & Services, Landmark Software & Services, Sperry Drilling, Testing & Subsea, Wireline & Perforating, and Consulting & Project Management. Halliburton's former subsidiary, KBR, is a major construction company of refineries, oil fields, pipelines, and chemical plants. Halliburton announced on April 5, 2007 that it had sold the division and severed its corporate relationship with KBR, which had been its contracting, engineering and construction unit as a part of the company.\n\nThe company has been involved in numerous controversies, including the Deepwater Horizon explosion, for which it agreed to settle outstanding legal claims against it by paying litigants $1.1 billion.\n\nKBR, one of Halliburton's subsidiaries at the time, paid bribes to high-ranking Nigerian officials between 1994 and 2004. Under a deal reached with the U.S. Justice Department, Halliburton has agreed to pay $382 million to settle the bribery case.\n\nJeff Miller was promoted to President of Halliburton on August 1, 2014, and CEO on June 1, 2017, replacing Dave Lesar.\n\nU.S. regional office locations are Anchorage, Alaska; Bakersfield, California; Denver, Colorado; New Iberia, Louisiana; Houma, Louisiana; New Orleans, Louisiana; Shreveport, Louisiana; Lafayette, Louisiana; Oklahoma City, Oklahoma; Zanesville, Ohio; Artesia, New Mexico; Farmington, New Mexico; Hobbs, New Mexico; Naples, Utah; Carrollton, Texas; Alvarado, Texas; Fort Worth, Texas; Odessa, Texas; San Antonio, Texas, Fort Lupton, Colorado; Grand Junction, Colorado; Williston, North Dakota; Evansville Wyoming; Rock Springs, Wyoming\n\nMajor international offices are in Canada, Mexico, Venezuela, Colombia, Argentina, Panama, Bolivia, Brazil, Ecuador, Algeria, Angola, Egypt, Gabon, Nigeria, Cameroon, Republic of Congo, Libya, Austria, New Zealand, Germany, Italy, Netherlands, Norway, United Kingdom, France, Spain, Australia, Russia, China, India, Iran, Thailand, Malaysia, Indonesia, Vietnam, Japan, Singapore, Pakistan, U.A.E., Oman, Yemen, Saudi Arabia, Iraq and Kuwait.\n\nWorldwide technology centers are in Duncan, Oklahoma; Carrollton, Texas; Houston, Texas; Pune, India; and Singapore.\n\nEnergy services (the company's historical cornerstone), formation evaluation, digital and consulting solutions, production volume optimization, and fluid systems are the major business segments. These businesses continue to be profitable, and the company is one of the world's largest players in these service industries; it is second after Schlumberger, and is followed by Saipem, Weatherford International, and Baker Hughes.\n\nWith the acquisition of Dresser Industries in 1998, the Kellogg-Brown & Root division (in 2002 renamed to KBR) was formed by merging Halliburton's Brown & Root (acquired 1962) subsidiary and the M.W. Kellogg division of Dresser (which Dresser had merged with in 1988). KBR is a major international construction company that works in an industry that tends to have an element of volatility and is subject to significant fluctuations in revenue and profit. Asbestos-related litigation from Kellogg acquisition caused the company to book more than US$4.0 billion in losses from 2002 through 2004.\n\nAs a result of the asbestos-related costs and staggering losses on the Barracuda Caratinga FPSO construction project based in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, Halliburton lost approximately $900 million U.S. a year from 2002 through 2004. A final non-appealable settlement in the asbestos case was reached in January 2005 which allowed Halliburton subsidiary KBR to exit Chapter 11 bankruptcy and returned the company to quarterly profitability. While Halliburton's revenues have increased because of its contracts in the Middle East, the overall impact on its bottom line has been mixed.\n\nAt a meeting for investors and analysts in August 2004, a plan was outlined to divest the KBR division through a possible sale, spin-off or initial public offering. Analysts at Deutsche Bank valued KBR at up to $2.15 billion, while others believed it could be worth closer to $3 billion by 2005. KBR became a separately listed company on April 5, 2007.\n\nIn 1919, Erle P. Halliburton started the New Method Oil Well Cementing Company.\n\nIn 1920, he brought a wild gas well under control, using cement, for W.G. Skelly, near Wilson, Oklahoma. On March 1, 1921, the Halliburton \"method and means of excluding water from oil wells\" was assigned a patent from the U.S. Patent Office. Halliburton invented the revolutionary cement jet mixer, to eliminate hand-mixing of cement, and the measuring line, a tool used to guarantee cementing accuracy. By 1922, the Halliburton Oil Well Cementing Company (HOWCO) was prospering from the Mexia, Texas oil boom, having cemented its 500th well in late summer.\n\nIn 1924, the company was incorporated in Delaware, with 56 people on its payroll. The stock of the corporation was owned by Erle and Vida Halliburton and by seven major oil companies: Magnolia, Texas, Gulf, Humble, Sun, Pure and Atlantic.\n\nIn 1926, its first foreign venture began with sale of equipment to Burma and India.\n\nThroughout the 1930s and 1940s, Halliburton continued cementing across America. In 1938, Halliburton cemented its first offshore well using a truck on a barge off the Louisiana coast. In 1940, Halliburton opened offices in Venezuela and introduced bulk handling of cementing to the industry. In 1947, the Halliburton first marine cementing vessel went into service.\n\nIn 1951, Halliburton first appeared in Europe as Halliburton Italiana SpA, a wholly owned subsidiary in Italy. Over the next seven years, Halliburton launched Halliburton Company Germany GmbH, set up operations in Argentina and established a subsidiary in England. By 1951, HOWCO had service centers operating in Canada, Venezuela, Peru, Colombia, Saudi Arabia and Indonesia. Halliburton revenues topped $100 million for the first time in 1952.\n\nErle P. Halliburton died in Los Angeles in 1957. HOWCO is at this time worth $190 million with camps all over the world. The same year, HOWCO purchased Welex, which pioneered jet perforation. Otis Engineering, an oil field service and equipment company specializing in manufacturing pressure control equipment for oil and gas producing wells, was acquired in 1959.\n\nOn July 5, 1961, the company changed its name to the Halliburton Company. In 1963, Halliburton was the first company in Oklahoma to receive the Presidential \"E\" for Export flag in recognition of notable contributions to foreign trade.\n\nHalliburton opened a manufacturing center in Duncan, Oklahoma, in 1964. The company began to experiment with new technologies to help their services – for example, beginning in 1965 a pilot operation of a computer network system – the first such installation in the oilfield services industry. In 1966, workers broke ground for a new wing at the Research Center in Duncan that tripled the available space for the Chemical Research and Design Department.\n\nIn 1968, an automated mixing system for drilling mud was developed by Halliburton, primarily for use offshore. Gearhart Industries (acquired by Halliburton Energy Services in 1989) introduced the first digital computer logging system in 1974.\n\nIn 1969, Halliburton began construction of a base camp at Prudhoe Bay on Alaska's North Slope.\n\nIn 1975, it responded to environmental concerns by working with the nonprofit Clean Gulf Associates to contain and clean up oil spills. In 1976, Halliburton established the Halliburton Energy Institute in Duncan, Oklahoma, to provide an industry forum for disseminating technical information.\nIn 1980, Halliburton Research Center opened in Duncan, Oklahoma. The company's billionth sack of cement for customers was pumped in 1983. In 1989, Halliburton acquired logging and perforating specialist company Gearhart Industries and combined it with its subsidiary Welex to form Halliburton Logging Services.\n\nThroughout the 1980s, Halliburton's subsidiaries continued their projects around the world (under management of former CEO Brian Darcy) even in countries once considered enemies. Equipment was provided for the first multiwell platform offshore China, and an Otis Engineering team controlled a gigantic Tengiz field blowout in the Soviet Union.\n\nFollowing the end of Operation Desert Storm in February 1991, the Pentagon, led by then defense secretary Dick Cheney, paid Halliburton subsidiary Brown & Root Services over $8.5 million to study the use of private military forces with American soldiers in combat zones. Halliburton crews also helped bring 725 burning oil wells under control in Kuwait.\n\nIn 1995, Cheney replaced Thomas H. Cruikshank, as chairman and CEO. Cruikshank had served since 1989.\n\nIn the early 1990s, Halliburton was found to be in violation of federal trade barriers in Iraq and Libya, having sold these countries dual-use oil drilling equipment and, through its former subsidiary, Halliburton Logging Services, sending six pulse neutron generators to Libya. After having plead guilty, the company was fined $1.2 million, with another $2.61 million in penalties.\n\nDuring the Balkans conflict in the 1990s, Kellogg Brown-Root (KBR) supported U.S. peacekeeping forces in Bosnia and Herzegovina, Croatia and Hungary with food, laundry, transportation, and other life-cycle management services.\n\nIn 1998, Halliburton merged with Dresser Industries, which included Kellogg. Prescott Bush was a director of Dresser Industries, which is now part of Halliburton; his son, former president George H. W. Bush, worked for Dresser Industries in several positions from 1948 to 1951, before he founded Zapata Corporation.\n\n\"The Wall Street Journal\" reported in 2001 that a subsidiary of Halliburton Energy Services called Halliburton Products and Services Ltd. (HPS) opened an office in Tehran. The company, HPS, operated on the ninth floor of a new north Tehran tower block. Although HPS was incorporated in the Cayman Islands in 1975 and is \"non-American\", it shares both the logo and name of Halliburton Energy Services and, according to Dow Jones Newswires, offers services from Halliburton units worldwide through its Tehran office. Such behavior, undertaken while Cheney was CEO of Halliburton, may have violated the Trading with the Enemy Act. A Halliburton spokesman, responding to inquiries from Dow Jones, said \"This is not breaking any laws. This is a foreign subsidiary and no U.S. person is involved in this. No U.S. person is facilitating any transaction. We are not performing directly in that country.\" Later David Lesar would book his own flights to the Tehran office through the UK arm of KBR. No legal action has been taken against the company or its officials.\n\nIn April 2002, KBR was awarded a $7 million contract to construct steel holding cells at Camp X-Ray.\n\nIn November 2002, KBR was tasked to plan oil well firefighting in Iraq, and in February 2003 was issued a contract to conduct the work. Critics contend that it was a no-bid contract, awarded due to Dick Cheney's position as vice president. Concern was also expressed that the contract could allow KBR to pump and distribute Iraqi oil. Others contend, however, that this was not strictly a \"no-bid contract,\" and was invoked under a contract that KBR won \"in a competitive bid process.\" The contract, referred to as LOGCAP, is a contingency-based contract that is invoked at the convenience of the Army. Because the contract is essentially a retainer, specific orders are not competitively bid (as the overall contract was).\n\nIn May 2003, Halliburton revealed in SEC filings that its KBR subsidiary had paid a Nigerian official $2.4 million in bribes in order to receive favorable tax treatment., United Arab Emirates\nIn October 2004, after emerging from the bankruptcy protection, Halliburton opened a new facility on , replacing an older facility that opened in 1948, in Rock Springs, Wyoming. With over approximately 500 employees, Halliburton is one of the largest private employers in Sweetwater County.\n\nOn January 24, 2006, Halliburton's subsidiary KBR (formerly Kellogg, Brown and Root) announced that it had been awarded a $385 million contingency contract by the Department of Homeland Security to build \"temporary detention and processing facilities\" or internment camps. According to \"Business Wire\", this contract will be executed in cooperation with the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, Fort Worth District. Critics point to the Guantanamo Bay detention camp as a possible model. According to a press release posted on the Halliburton website, \"The contract, which is effective immediately, provides for establishing temporary detention and processing capabilities to augment existing Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) Detention and Removal Operations (DRO) Program facilities in the event of an emergency influx of immigrants into the U.S., or to support the rapid development of new programs. The contingency support contract provides for planning and, if required, initiation of specific engineering, construction and logistics support tasks to establish, operate and maintain one or more expansion facilities.\"\n\nIn February 2008, a hard disk and two computers containing classified information were stolen from Petrobras while in Halliburton's custody. Allegedly, the content inside the stolen material was data on the recently discovered Tupi oil field. Initial police inquiries suggest that it could be a common container theft operation. The container was a ramshackle in complete disorder indicating that thieves were after \"valuables and not only laptops,\" said an expert consulted by the daily newspaper Folha de S. Paulo.\n\nIn 2008, Halliburton agreed to outsource its mission-critical information technology infrastructure to a Dallas/Fort Worth Metroplex data center operated by CyrusOne Networks LLC.\n\nOn May 14, 2010, President Barack Obama said in an interview with CNN that \"you had executives of BP and Transocean and Halliburton falling over each other to point the finger of blame at somebody else\" when referring to the congressional hearings held during the Deepwater Horizon oil spill. \"The American people could not have been impressed with that display, and I certainly wasn't.\" According to Tim Probert, executive vice president of Halliburton, \"Halliburton, as a service provider to the well owner, is contractually bound to comply with the well owner's instructions\".\n\nIt was anticipated that Halliburton's $2.5 billion \"Restore Iraqi Oil\" (RIO) contract would pay for itself as well as for reconstruction of the entire country. Plans called for more oil to be exported from Iraq's northern oil fields than actually occurred. Halliburton's work on the pipeline crossing the Tigris river at Al Fatah has been called a failure. Critics claim that the oil fields are barely usable and access to international markets is severely limited. As an example, against the advice of its own experts, Halliburton attempted to dig a tunnel through a geological fault zone. The underground terrain was a jumble of boulders, voids, cobblestones, and gravel and not appropriate for the kind of drilling Halliburton planned. \"No driller in his right mind would have gone ahead,\" said Army geologist Robert Sanders when the military finally sent people to inspect the work.\n\nOn November 17, 2014 Halliburton and Baker Hughes jointly announced a definitive agreement under which Halliburton will, subject to the conditions set forth in the agreement, acquire Baker Hughes in a stock and cash transaction valued at $34.6 billion. A press release made available on the former's website, as at December 11, 2014 detailed the restructuring in the integration to follow. The firm announced it would acquire Baker Hughes for around $35 billion in cash and stock, creating an oilfield services company that aims to compete with Schlumberger. Prior to the merger of Baker Hughes and Halliburton, Halliburton must divest over $5 billion of its assets according to the regulations created by US competition enforcement authorities. The merger had a deadline of the end of April 2016 after which, if a decision had not been made, both companies could walk away from the deal if they chose. At the beginning of May 2016, the day after the deadline expired, Halliburton and Baker Hughes announced the termination of the merger agreement.\n\nHalliburton has become the object of several controversies involving the Iraq War and the company's ties to former U.S. Vice President Dick Cheney. Cheney retired from the company during the 2000 U.S. presidential election campaign with a severance package worth $36 million. As of 2004, he had received $398,548 in deferred compensation from Halliburton while Vice President. Cheney was chairman and CEO of Halliburton Company from 1995 to 2000 and has received stock options from Halliburton.\n\nIn the run-up to the Iraq War, Halliburton was awarded a $7 billion contract for which only Halliburton was allowed to bid. Under U.S. law, the government uses single-bid contracts for a number of reasons, to include when in the view of the government, only one organization is capable of fulfilling the requirement.\n\nBunnatine Greenhouse, a civil servant with 20 years of contracting experience, had complained to Army officials on numerous occasions that Halliburton had been unlawfully receiving special treatment for work in Iraq, Kuwait and the Balkans. Criminal investigations were opened by the U.S. Justice Department, the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) and the Pentagon's inspector general. These investigations found no wrongdoing within the contract award and execution process.\n\nIn one of Greenhouse's claims, she said that military auditors caught Halliburton overcharging the Pentagon for fuel deliveries into Iraq. She also complained that Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld's office took control of every aspect of Halliburton's $7 billion Iraqi oil/infrastructure contract. Greenhouse was later demoted for poor performance in her position. Greenhouse's attorney, Michael Kohn portrayed her performance reviews as punishment for criticizing the administrations, he stated in \"The New York Times\" that \"she is being demoted because of her strict adherence to procurement requirements and the Army's preference to sidestep them when it suits their needs.\"\n\nOn September 8, 2010, an internal report released by BP into the Deepwater Horizon explosion claimed that poor practices of Halliburton staff had contributed to the disaster. Investigations carried out by the National Commission on the BP Deepwater Horizon Oil Spill and Offshore Drilling found that Halliburton was jointly at fault along with BP and Transocean for the spill. The concrete that Halliburton used was an unstable mixture, and eventually caused hydrocarbons to leak into the well, causing the explosion that started the crisis.\n\nHalliburton pleaded guilty to destroying evidence after the April 2010 Deepwater Horizon disaster; the company destroyed computer simulations it performed in the months after the accident, simulations that contradicted Halliburton's claim that it was BP who had not followed Halliburton's advice. BP had employed Halliburton to oversee the process by which cement is used to seal pipes in oil and gas wells, thereby preventing leaks. Government investigators had ordered companies involved in drilling the well to preserve all relevant evidence.\n\nIn early December 2010, the Nigerian government filed corruption charges against Cheney in connection with his role as the chief executive of Halliburton. The case relates to an alleged $182 million contract involving a four-company joint venture to build a liquefied natural gas plant on Bonny Island in southern Nigeria. Earlier in 2009, KBR, a former subsidiary of Halliburton, agreed to pay $402 million after admitting that it bribed Nigerian officials, and Halliburton paid $177 million to settle allegations by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission without admitting any wrongdoing. In mid-December 2010, the case was settled when Nigeria agreed to drop the corruption charges against Cheney and Halliburton in exchange for a $250 million settlement. According to Femi Babafemi, the spokesperson for the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission, the $250 million would include approximately $130 million frozen in a Swiss bank, and the rest would be paid as fines.\n\nThe Federal Contractor Misconduct Database details 10 instances of misconduct since 1995 under which Halliburton has agreed to pay settlements of $791 million. A further 22 instances of misconduct relate to the company's former subsidiary KBR.\n\nIn 2002, Toxics Release Inventory (TRI) reports were completed to measure the amount of chemicals emitted from Halliburton's Harris County, Texas facility. The TRI is a publicly available EPA database that contains information on toxic chemical releases and waste management activities reported annually by certain industries as well as federal facilities. The facility had 230 TRI air releases in 2001 and 245 in 2002.\n\nOn June 7, 2006, Halliburton's Farmington, New Mexico facility created a toxic cloud that forced people to evacuate their homes.\n\nHalliburton may also be implicated in the oil spills in the Timor Sea off Australia in August 2009 and in the Gulf of Mexico in April 2010 for improper cementing. Halliburton staff were employed on the Transocean operated Deepwater Horizon oil rig in the Mexican Gulf. Halliburton staff completed cementation of the final production well 20 hours prior to the Deepwater Horizon drilling rig explosion, but had not yet set the final cement plug.\n\nIn July 2013, Halliburton Co agreed to plead guilty to charges that it destroyed evidence relating to the 2010 Deepwater Horizon oil spill. This incurred a $200,000 fine; the firm also agreed to three years of probation and to continue cooperating with the criminal probe into the spill. In September 2014, the company agreed to pay $1.1 billion in damages to settle the majority of claims against it relating to the explosion, removing the uncertainty which had hung over the company for the previous four years\n\nJamie Leigh Jones testified at a Congressional hearing that she had been gang-raped by as many as seven co-workers in Iraq in 2005 when she was an employee of KBR, and then falsely imprisoned in a shipping container for 24 hours without food or drink. KBR was a subsidiary of Halliburton at the time. Jones and her lawyers said that 38 women have contacted her reporting similar experiences while working as contractors in Iraq, Kuwait, and other countries. On September 15, 2009, the 5th Circuit Court of Appeals ruled in favor of Halliburton, in a 2 to 1 ruling, and found that her alleged injuries were not, in fact, in any way related to her employment and thus, not covered by the contract. This decision effectively meant that the mandatory arbitration clause in her contract did not apply.\n\nThese incidents have tainted the public perception of Halliburton, with a consumer study rating it as the 5th least reputable company in America.\n\nOn April 15, 2006, Halliburton filed a registration statement with the Securities and Exchange Commission to sell up to 20 percent of its KBR stock on the NYSE under the ticker symbol \"KBR\", as part of an eventual plan for KBR to be a separate company from Halliburton.\n\nIn November 2006, Halliburton began selling its stake in KBR, its major subsidiary, and by February 2007 had completely sold off the subsidiary. In June 2007, several days after Stewart Bowen, the Special Inspector General, released a new report, the Army announced that KBR would share another $150 billion contract with two other contractors, Fluor and Dyncorp, over the next 10 years.\n\nIn accordance with the law of armed conflict and to maintain non-combatant status, Halliburton does not arm its truck drivers. Trucks are often the target of insurgent attacks. On September 20, 2005, a convoy of four Halliburton trucks was ambushed north of Baghdad. All four trucks were struck by improvised explosive devices and were disabled. Their US National Guard escort was thought to have abandoned the disabled vehicles, leaving the drivers defenseless. Three of the four truck drivers were killed by the insurgents while the surviving driver caught the event on video. Although the trucks had military camouflage paint, the drivers were civilian. The US military returned to the scene 45 minutes later. However, in a statement by senior military officials in Iraq, an investigation revealed that troops did not abandon the civilians and they were all exiting the \"kill zone\" during the ambush.\n\nOn March 31, 2003, Management at Halliburton restated earnings downward by $14 million for the fourth quarter of 2002. In the restatement, an additional $3 million expense (net of tax) to continuing operations and an $11 million expense, net of tax, to discontinued operations were recorded. In March 2, 2005, Halliburton restated its 2004 fourth-quarter earnings to add $2 million US in after-tax losses to reflect the collection of a $10 million receivable that had been reserved and a correction in lease accounting.\n\nAs of Halliburton's latest form 10-K filings with the SEC, Exhibit 21.1 lists the following as subsidiaries of Halliburton Co.:\n\nHalliburton's headquarters (North Belt Campus) are located in northern Houston, Texas, near George H.W. Bush Intercontinental Airport.\n\nHalliburton was headquartered in Dallas, Texas from 1961 to 2003. The company moved its headquarters from the Southland Life Building in Dallas to of space in Lincoln Plaza in Downtown Dallas in 1985. 20 employees worked in Halliburton's headquarters in Dallas.\n\nHalliburton planned to move its headquarters to Houston in 2002. Halliburton, which signed its lease to occupy a portion of 5 Houston Center in Downtown Houston in 2002, moved its headquarters there by July 2003. Halliburton occupied of space on the 24th floor in 5 Houston Center.\n\nIn 2009 Halliburton announced that it planned to move its headquarters to the North Belt Campus in Houston. In addition it planned to consolidate operations at its Westchase and North Belt Campus. The move occurred in 2009. The North Belt complex will house 2,500 employees. Halliburton planned to add a research and development facility with laboratories, a new cafeteria, a childcare center, two additional parking garages, and fitness and wellness centers for employees. The plans for the North Belt Campus had been delayed by one year, and Halliburton expects completion in 2013. The construction of the North Belt administration building is scheduled to begin in late 2010.\n\nAccording to Marilyn Bayless, the president of the North Houston Greenspoint Chamber of Commerce, in 2003 Halliburton had planned to move operations out of the North Belt office because other area school districts offered the freeport tax exemptions while the Aldine Independent School District (AISD), where the North Belt office is located, did not. In order to attract businesses, in May 2003, AISD began offering the same tax exemption as other jurisdictions. Subsequently, Halliburton retained the North Belt office.\n\nHalliburton engages 3rd party political lobbyists in jurisdictions where it holds interests. For example, in South Australia it engages GRACosway.\n"}

Hurricane engineering is a relatively new and emerging discipline within the field of civil engineering. It is an integration of many recognized branches of engineering, such as structural engineering, wind engineering, coastal engineering, and forensic engineering, with other recognized sciences and planning functions such as, climatology, oceanography, architecture, emergency management and preparedness, hazard mitigation, and hazard vulnerability analysis. Hurricane engineering aims to minimize risks to human safety, the natural and built environment, and business processes.\n\nAs a result of the tremendous threats to life safety and economic disruptions caused by the 2004 and 2005 hurricane seasons, governmental organizations, such as the United States National Science Foundation, have recognized the need to better understand hurricane threats and further establish this discipline. In September 2006, the National Science Board released recommendations to the United States Congress calling for major new investments in hurricane science and engineering.\n\nAccredited university engineering programs, such as the Louisiana State University civil engineering department and University of Notre Dame Department of Civil Engineering and Geological Sciences, are establishing programs to better understand these catastrophic storms and their interaction with the environment. The LSU Hurricane Center has begun to offer hurricane engineering courses with the focus of educating students on the unique threats caused by hurricanes.\n\nIn the Northwest Pacific, where the term for strong tropical cyclones is Typhoon, instead of Hurricane, the concept of Typhoon Engineering, which is very similar to Hurricane Engineering, is being proposed.\n\nThe past two decades have witnessed exponential growth in damage due to hurricanes and the situation continues to deteriorate. The most vulnerable areas, coastal counties along the Gulf and Atlantic seaboards, are experiencing greater population growth and development than anyplace else in the country. If the trend of rapidly increasing losses caused by hurricanes is to be reversed, a whole new philosophy of understanding, planning, and preparedness is required. The Hurricane Engineering curriculum is the result of a multidisciplinary project aimed at giving engineering students a comprehensive understanding of the hazards associated with hurricanes: \n\n\n<br>\n"}

Material, Inq's personalised magazine, became the top free news app in the UK App Store and achieved a number 4 position in the US, shortly after launch. SO.HO, a social launcher developed by Inq, was also warmly received with press positioning it as an alternative to Facebook Home.\n\nPrior to focusing on software, Inq released a series of \"social mobiles\" for which they were awarded \"Best Newcomer\" and \"Best Handset\" at the GSMA in 2009.\n\nIn January 2014 Inq announced that the business was to close down and that the apps they had in market would not be updated after this point.\n\nInq held offices in London and Rome and employed between 11 and 50 staff across the two offices.\n\nThe company was founded in 2007 by Ken Johnstone (Inq's current CEO), Frank Meehan and Jeff Taylor. It is a fully owned subsidiary of Hutchison Whampoa and is backed by Li Ka-shing who is Chairman of Hutchison Whampoa and is also an investor in Facebook and Spotify.\n\nInq launched two software only products in 2013; Material a discovery app that delivered each of its users a personalised magazine based on their interests and SO.HO, a launcher and app that brought together Facebook, Twitter and Instagram in one place. Shortly after its release, the Material iOS app became a and achieved a number 4 rank in the Free News chart in the US app store.\nInq describe their apps as social software and parts of the functionality are based on surfacing social networks or using elements from the social graph.\n\nInq describe Material as a \"personalised magazine\" that \"hunts out content based on your interests\". The app delivers a fresh update of content twice a day, grouping each delivery into a \"morning/evening edition\" The topics and stories in each edition are personalised to match the interests of each user and users can also add topics via a menu. The more a user uses Material, the more it learns about his or her interests. Users may also add additional topics of interest. In a press release regarding the product, CEO Ken Johnstone positioned Material as an anti-dote to content overload stating \"With the avalanche of content out there, we're focused on finding new and exciting ways for people to get directly to the things they love. Material was the result of this thinking, an app that takes all the hard work out of finding great stuff.” and Inq state that the discovery app will help users \"discover new content from new places\". Material is available for iPhone and Android smartphones.\n\nInq released Material in BETA as an Android only product. The BETA app was praised by press for \"its colorful and intelligent design\" and UI. Similarly the Android public showed an interest in the app with the BETA achieving over 50,000 installs. In August 2014 Inq launched an iOS version of Material which had a redesigned UI and improvements to Inq's “interest extraction engine,” which forms the intelligence behind the app. Shortly after its release, the Material iOS app became a number 1 app in the Free News category and achieved a rank of number 4 rank in the Free News chart in the US app store.\n\nThe app has been compared by press to other personalised news services such as Flipboard and Zite. In a review of the Material app, VentureBeat commented \"While there are quite a few news-reading apps out there and Flipboard holds the dominant position, Material sets itself apart with design and intelligent curation.\" Unlike Flipboard, the makers of MATERIAL claim it will \"evolve with you\", learning what you like and recognising when your interests change \n\nThe mobile launcher, SO.HO was launched by Inq for Android devices in 2013 The interface was designed by Chris Kelly. SO.HO allows the user to have Facebook, Instagram and Twitter feeds on their homescreen, additionally the homescreen app allows for tweets, status updates, likes and comments to be made through the launcher. The launcher provides the user a full screen version of their respective Twitter, Instagram and Facebook networks after they unlock their phone, in a similar manner to Facebook Home or HTC Blinkfeed. SO.HO is available in English, Spanish (Europe/US) Portuguese, Korean, Hindi, Italian, German and French. In press commentary about the launcher, Inq initially stated that they intend to add more social networks to the launcher. However more recent updates to the app have added in bespoke social media feeds that mix content from multiple networks in one view. The SO.HO feed is described by Ina as \" a place where you can see the latest videos, pictures and links shared from all your friends across Facebook, Twitter and Instagram.\" whilst the \"Hashtag feed\" shows users \"the conversations happening right now across Facebook, Twitter and Instagram about that subject\".\n\nWhen it was founded in 2007, Inq's business model focused on creating affordable, mid-range smartphones which deeply integrated social networking and a range of usability features. Inq phones were sold in Canada, India, Singapore, UK, Austria, Australia, Hong Kong, Ireland, Italy and Sweden.\n\nAs per news reports, Singapore Telecommunications (Singtel), on September 14, 2009 announced that it would be start selling the social networking phone INQ Mini 3G, developed by INQ mobile. This phone launched on September 19, 2009 in Singapore. On March 18, 2010 Aircel in India started selling the INQ Mini and INQ Chat, and on July 28, 2010 the INQ Chat went onsale in Canada from Telus and Koodo.\n\nIn January 2013 Inq announced that they would no longer manufacture handsets but would focus exclusively on producing social software. A Venturebeat article at CES quoted Ken Johnston as saying that “We’ve finished up with hardware a year ago, and we’ve been working our app engine since then,” Inq CEO and cofounder Ken Johnstone said last night at a CES 2013 event. Inq stated on their Facebook page that they will not be making further handsets but that they will continue to support those who own an Inq handset.\n\nThe INQ1 was INQ's first mobile phone. It was released in December 2008, featuring a 2.2\" QVGA screen, and a 3.2megapixel camera. Applications on the phone include: Skype, Last.fm, Ebay, Facebook, Myspace and Windows Live Messenger.\n\nThe follow on from the INQ1, this time with added Twitter functionality. Sharing a similar design to its 'sister' phone the Chat 3G, interchangeable back covers are available to purchase. The phone has a 2.0megapixel camera and was launched at £39.99 in the UK. The INQ1 is notable for its very tight integration with Windows Live Messenger, Facebook and Skype. It was endorsed at launch by Mark Zuckerberg and other industry identities.\n\nA high level of firmware branding is present in the phone's operating system, this signifies a push for highly proprietary \"for the network, by the network\" mobile telephones which are extremely hard to unlock or debrand. In September 2009 Inq publicly stated that the company would build phones based on the Android mobile operating system, and claims they will be ready in early 2011.\n\nThe 'big sister' to the Mini 3G, featuring similar functionality. However, the phone has an additional QWERTY keyboard, a 3.2megapixel camera and a GPS device.\n\nThe first of INQ's new Android-powered phones, moving away from BREW used in their previous phones. The mobile has more integration to Facebook than the previous phones, with direct access from the homescreen to popular aspects like Chat and Places. This is also the first INQ phone to feature Spotify, which replaces a proprietary music player altogether. The Cloud Touch has a button dedicated to Spotify so you can access immediately, in addition to an 'Info' button for quick access to settings and information. The phone has a 3.5\" HVGA touchscreen, and will be available in three different colours from April in the UK.\n\nSocial networks and related services embedded into Inq phones\n\nInq was founded in 2008 by Ken Johnstone, Frank Meehan and Jeff Taylor. In August 2009, the company launched two phones-the INQ Mini 3G (a candy-bar type form factor with Twitter and Facebook) and the INQ Chat 3G (a QWERTY device with Twitter, Facebook and GMail integration). Both models went on sale in Q4 2009 and feature removable coloured back panels. The INQ1 won Phone of the Year at the 2009 GSMA Awards in Barcelona which are known informally as the industry Oscars. The judges highlighted the handset's affordability, deep integration of social networks and ease of use in their winner's announcement.\n\nIn September 2010 news reports speculated about rumors that Facebook and Inq were working together on a “Facebook Phone”. To date no Facebook phone has emerged from either Inq or Facebook themselves.\n\nIn June 2011 it was reported that Jeff Taylor had left the company to start his own venture with Inq PR Head Soheb Panja This was followed by an announcement in September 2011 that Frank Meehan had been replaced as CEO by Ken Johnstone, co-founder and formerly Director of Products for Inq.\n\nIn January 2013 Inq announced that they would be focusing exclusively on producing social software moving forward and would no longer be involved in the manufacture or distribution of handsets. A Venturebeat article at CES quoted Ken Johnston as saying that “We’ve finished up with hardware a year ago, and we’ve been working our app engine since then,” Inq CEO and cofounder Ken Johnstone said last night at a CES 2013 event. This announcement was followed by a company rebrand, at which the company redesigned its logo and began to write the company name as Inq Mobile rather than the original INQ.\n\nInq launched a beta version of MATERIAL, a content discovery engine in February 2013. In an interview with Pocket-lint MATERIAL was positioned as a continuation of the Inq business, rather than a pivot from phones, with Pocket-Lint writing that \"Inq is no stranger to \"social DNA\". The brief foray into devices with the INQ Cloud Touch back in 2011 very much centred on a granular integration of services like Facebook, helping important content rise to the surface. That ethos still sits at the core of what Inq is working on.\". Other titles presented MATERIAL as a \"pivot\" for Inq, suggesting a change in business strategy.\n\nInq followed this with the launch a second beta app, SO.HO in May 2013. SO.HO (short for Social Homescreen) is an Android launcher. On the Inq Mobile blog, Inq say that SO.HO \"allows you to put your favourite social networks on the homescreen of your Android mobile so that you can check what’s happening on multiple social networks without diving in and out of apps.\"\n\nIn August 2013 Inq launched the iOS version of Material and brought the Android version of Material out of beta.The launch of Material for iPhone was covered by many key press titles including Engagdet, TechCrunch and Venturebeat.\n\nAs of 31 January 2014 they have ceased operations, the last issue of Material was on the 28th. SO.HO will continue to work but will no longer be offered/updated.\n\n"}

The term \"jack post\" is one of many describing the same system, other names include any assortment of \"adjustable\", \"steel\", \"jack\" and \"shoring\" with \"post\", \"column\" and \"prop\", depending on their precise construction - the \"jack\" refers to examples with a jack screw to adjust the precise length of the post. They are also known by any number of trade names, notably \"lally column\" and \"Acrow prop\". Jack posts are widely standardized.\n\nJack posts are telescopic tubular steel props consisting of two primary parts, the main part of the post, and the jack screw or other adjustable fitting on the end. Both ends are normally fitted with flat metal plates on the end, providing additional support area. Most jack posts are split in two near the middle, with the upper end carrying the jack designed to slide within the lower portion. Gross adjustment for length is first made by pulling a pin and sliding the two sections within each other until they almost fill the gap, inserting the pin to lock them, then using the screw to close any remaining gap. Other designs used two threaded pipes instead of sliding sections, clamping sections, or other similar concepts to lock the system at a specific length.\n\nJack posts are mostly used for shoring: temporary supports during building repair or alteration work, rather than scaffolding: access platforms for workers. A typical use is to support an existing horizontal beam while its original masonry supports are removed or repaired. When masonry itself is to be supported, holes are first knocked through the brickwork and a strong 'needle' or 'strongboy' is placed through the hole. A pair of props are then used, one under each end. Existing windows or doorways may also be supported directly, or via needles. As the plates on the end of the posts are typically small, they offer little sideways support. If there is any sideways force, props should be strutted or 'laced' with scaffolding poles.\n\nAcrow props are adjustable for height by a large diameter screw thread, formed on the outside of the outer tube itself. The screw thread provides a fine adjustment over a short range. A loose pin through a series of holes in the inner tube gives a wider range of coarse adjustment. Use of a screw thread also allows the props to be tightened when already in place, to adjust the load that each one bears. \n\nA recent improvement to Acrow props was to shape this baseplate with notches, allowing pallet loads of horizontal props to be stacked neatly, rather than randomly piled.\n\nAlthough the original Acrow prop was only intended for vertical support, the range has since been extended. Shoring 'push and pull' props with swivelling footplates are available and are used to support concrete formwork. Horizontal strutting props are used for shoring trenchwork. These are similar, but have a 'claw' form to their baseplates.\n\nAcrow props were invented by Swiss-born William de Vigier, who came to London in 1935. At first traditionalism amongst builders preferred the established timber props, cut to fit for each job. The break for Vigier's adjustable prop's came when they were adopted by a few large builders, including Sir Robert McAlpine. By 1939, over 40,000 Acrow props were in use.\n\nVigier's company was named the Acrow Group, after his solicitor Mr A Crowe. He adopted this name as, like Kodak, it was an easily pronouncable neologism, with the additional advantage of appearing early in alphabetical lists.\n\nAcrow props, their size, strength and construction, are now described by a British Standard BS4074: 1982. A similar lightweight European prop design exists, these have a maximum capacity of only .\n\nProps are made in a range of five BS standard sizes:\n\nThe safe load for each prop is a maximum of , reducing slightly when props are fully extended, or by up to half when the load is not perfectly vertical.\n"}

He made very expressive puppets and he developed a lot of visual effects in his movies. One of his innovations was the use of motion blur which he achieved, most likely, by the use of hidden string, which, because they were moving, didn't register on film during long exposures of each frame. He was a very successful in his time, making 2 films per year. His work has been restored thanks to his granddaughter, who preserved all his films from his French period.\n\nDirector Henry Selick is a well-known force in the world of stop motion animation, with \"Coraline\" – based on Neil Gaiman's best-selling novella and released in 2009 – being his most recent and successful work. \"Coraline\", the first stop motion animated feature to be shot entirely in stereoscopic 3-D, received lavish critical praise and became the second highest grossing stop motion feature in history. Kenneth Turan, writing for the Los Angeles Times, said, \"The third dimension comes of age with 'Coraline.' The first contemporary film in which the 3-D experience feels intrinsic to the story instead of a Godforsaken gimmick, 'Coraline' is a remarkable feat of imagination, a magical tale with a genuinely sinister edge.\" \"Coraline\", released by Focus Features, is the first feature film made by LAIKA, an animation company based in Portland, Oregon and headed up by Travis Knight. Selick made his feature film directing debut in 1993 with \"The Nightmare Before Christmas\", the first full-length, stop motion feature from a major studio. An instant holiday classic based on producer Tim Burton's story, \"Nightmare\" was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Visual Effects and Selick won the International Animated Film Society's Annie Award for Best Creative Supervision. In 1996, Selick followed with a second feature, \"James and the Giant Peach\", again produced by Burton, which combined stop motion animation with live-action. The film received widespread critical acclaim and won first prize at the world-renowned Annecy Film Festival in 1997.\n\nSelick studied animation at CalArts in California in the late 1970s with classmates John Lasseter, Brad Bird, and John Musker. Joe Ranft, Tim Burton, Jorgen Klubien, and Rick Heinrichs also attended CalArts, and both groups worked together at Disney Studios, with Ranft, Burton, Klubien, and Heinrichs collaborating with Selick in the years that followed on his feature films. While an animator at Disney, Selick received a grant to make an experimental short film, \"Seepage\", that combined hand-drawn animation with life-size cut-out human figures that he animated with stop motion. Leaving Disney in the early 80's, Selick moved to the Bay Area of California to work on the cut-out animated feature, \"Twice Upon A Time\" as a sequence director. He went on to direct many stop motion TV ads including nine Pillsbury Doughboy spots, but it was his work on his stop motion ads for MTV and his short pilot episode, \"Slow Bob In The Lower Dimensions\", that caught the public's eye and reunited him with his old friend Burton, who, fresh off his success as a live-action director, revived his brilliant idea for a film, \"The Nightmare Before Christmas\", and asked Selick to direct it. Selick put together a studio in San Francisco called \"Skellington Productions\" with producer Kathleen Gavin and production manager Phil Lofaro and grew his small band of story artists, animators, puppet makers, set builders, and lighters – including Ranft, Eric Leighton, Trey Thomas, Anthony Scott, Paul Berry, Pete Kozachik, Bo Henry, Bonita DeCarlo, etc. – into a full-fledged production team who spent three years making the film. Burton, directing first \"Batman Returns\" and then \"Ed Wood Jr.\" in Los Angeles while \"Nightmare\" was being made up north, reviewed storyboards and footage every weeks and sent his talented collaborator, Rick Heinrichs, up north to develop the look of Halloween Town in the film.\n\nFifteen years after the first theatrical release of \"Nightmare\", Selick has come full circle with \"Coraline\", leading a brilliant team of artists, animators, lighters, and technicians – many of them veterans from \"Nightmare\" – to create another hand-made, all stop motion feature film.\n\nTim Burton is very active in the field of stop motion animation. One of Burton's first films, \"Vincent\", is a six-minute stop motion animation about a young boy who wants to be Vincent Price. Several of his early live-action films such as Pee Wee's Big Adventure and Beetlejuice made use of stop motion. In 1993, Burton produced the all-stop motion animation \"The Nightmare Before Christmas\". The film was in production for three years due to the length of time it takes to shoot stop motion. The main characters in the film were puppets that in order to create realism in the film were structured hundreds of face models with different expressions. The film is based on a poem Burton wrote inspired by \"T'was the Night Before Christmas\" — it was then directed by Henry Selick. Selick later directed the adaptation of \"James and the Giant Peach\", a blend between stop motion animation and live action film. In 2005 \"Corpse Bride\" was released, another stop motion piece from Burton. Computer animation of the aliens for his 1996 science fiction comedy, \"Mars Attacks!\" was deliberately made to look like stop motion when the film's budget did not allow for the use of the actual stop motion process, blurring the line between the two forms of animation.\n\nNick Park and the Aardman team also produce commercials and music videos, notably the video for Peter Gabriel's \"Sledgehammer\", which uses many different animation techniques, including pixilation involving Gabriel holding poses while each frame was shot and moving between exposures, effectively becoming a human puppet. More recently Aardman used this technique on a series of short films for BBC Three entitled \"Angry Kid\", which starred a live actor wearing a mask. The actor's pose and the mask's expression had to be altered slightly for each exposure. Aardman has also created many films, of which some have become household names. Nick Park joined Aardman after they took interest in his college project, \"A Grand Day Out\". Since then, Nick Park has directed the following films for Aardman: \"The Wrong Trousers\", \"Creature Comforts\", \"A Close Shave\", \"Cracking Contraptions\", the feature film \"Chicken Run\", and more recently, another feature film \"\", co-produced with DreamWorks Animation. Nick Park's latest work is the new Wallace and Gromit short (30 minutes) called \"A Matter of Loaf and Death\", broadcast on BBC One on Christmas Day 2008. Nick Park has won several Academy Awards for Best Animation.\n\nWillis O'Brien's student Ray Harryhausen made many movies using a more elaborate version of puppet animation called model animation, first pioneered by O'Brien, mainly for his feature-length films, the difference being that model animation strives to be \"photo-realistic\" enough to be able to be combined with live action elements to create a final fantasy sequence that allows the audience to suspend their disbelief that they are watching animation elements. Example of his model animation techniques; most famously, are the seven-skeleton sequence from \"Jason and the Argonauts\" (1963). But aside from the more \"disguised\" stop motion efforts of O'Brien and Harryhausen, America and Britain were slower to embrace the stop motion film, and so its use mainly grew out of other locations and sources.\n\nDilldoid-1970s, Phil Tippett, a stop motion animator inspired by the works of Willis O'Brien and Ray Harryhausen, was tapped by George Lucas to work on Star Wars. After creating the Chess Set sequence and participating in the Cantina scene as a member of the monster band for the seminal movie, Phil was enlisted to join Lucas when he relocated ILM from Los Angeles to the Bay Area.\nDuring Tippett's tenure at ILM he earned an enduring place in the Star Wars galaxy by animating the Imperial Walkers and Tauntaun in The Empire Strikes and then was knighted as head of the studio's creature shop for Return of the Jedi. In addition to his artistic contributions Tippett's technical ingenuity was evident with the invention of the 'Go-Motion' animation technique in 1982 – a forerunner of today’s computer graphic imaging. He earned his first Academy Award© nomination for Dragonslayer and by 1983 received his first Oscar for Return of the Jedi.\nIn 1984, Tippett left ILM and, along with his partner Jules Roman, founded Tippett Studio in a garage in Berkeley to create a 10-minute experimental film called Prehistoric Beast. The Emmy award-winning CBS special, Dinosaur!, quickly followed it.\nFast forward several decades, the company now occupies four buildings in Berkeley, employs up to 200 artists and technicians and is best known for its outstanding CG character animation work.\nThe early days of Tippett Studio saw sequences designed, built and animated using stop motion for movies like Robocop, with the out of control robot ED209, and later Robocop 2, with the evil mayhem created by the Cain robot.\n\nOne acclaimed European puppet animation producer to break out in America was Hungarian animator George Pal, who, partially working in The Netherlands, produced a series of films in Europe during the 30s before coming to Hollywood to create more shorts in the 40s, now called \"Puppetoons\" under the Paramount banner, seven of which were nominated for Academy Awards for best animated film. In the late 40s, Pal evolved into feature film production, incorporating puppet animation into a live action setting in such films as \"The Great Rupert\" (1949), \"tom thumb (film)\" (1958), and \"The Wonderful World of the Brothers Grimm\" (1962). Pal used model animation (animated by Jim Danforth) in two other feature films, \"The Time Machine\" (1960) and \"7 Faces of Dr. Lao\" (1964), the latter nominated for a Special Effects Oscar, and the former winning the EFX Oscar award. Pal's work is documented in two feature films by Arnold Leibovit, released in the mid-80s, \"The Puppetoon Movie\" and \"The Fantasy Film Worlds of George Pal\" which are currently available on Blu-ray and DVD. More of Danforth's skilled model animation can be seen in \"Jack the Giant Killer\" (1962), the ending fire ladder sequence for \"It's a Mad Mad Mad Mad World\" (1963), \"The Zanti Misfits\" and \"Counterweight\" episodes of the original \"The Outer Limits\" TV series (1963), and, with equally prolific model animator David Allen, in \"Equinox\" (also titled \"The Beast\") (1967, 1970), \"Flesh Gordon\" (1974), and the prehistoric comedy \"Caveman\" (1981).\n\nCuppa Coffee Studios is based in Toronto and has also pioneered many of the modern techniques associated with stop motion. Started in 1992 by Adam Shaheen, the company has grown to now the single largest producer of stop motion for TV with over 250 employees and 48 Studios. All production is conducted at the facility.They have produced the classic \"Celebrity Deathmatch\", \"Rick and Steve\", \"Starveillance\", \"A Very Barry Christmas\" and \"JoJo's Circus\" and \"Glenn Martin DDS\", \"Life's a Zoo\", \"A Miser Brothers Christmas\", \"Crashbox\" and \"Ugly Americans\". The studio has won over 200 international broadcast awards for its work and an award-winning Commercial and Broadcast Design Departments.\n\nSuzie Templeton is most famous for her work on the film \"Peter and the Wolf\" for which she won the 2008 Academy Award for best Short Film (Animated).\n\nAdam Jones, Grammy Award-winning guitarist/musician/visual artist for the Grammy Award-winning progressive rock band Tool, uses stop motion capturing techniques for the majority of Tool's music videos as well. With the exception of Hush, the band members of Tool do not appear in their videos, but rather use a combination of clay animation and stop motion. Jones' studies began in 1983 at the Hollywood Makeup Academy by learning \"straight make-up\". His focus of interest shifted to film, and he began to work as a sculptor and special effects designer for such films as \"Jurassic Park\" and \"\". It was here where he learned the stop motion camera techniques he would later apply in Tool's music videos: \"Sober\" (on which he collaborated with Fred Stuhr), \"Prison Sex\", \"Stinkfist\", \"Ænema\", \"Schism\", and \"Parabola\". The techniques and style of Tool's music videos, particularly Sober and Prison Sex, borrow heavily from the work of The Brothers Quay.\n\nThe great pioneer of American stop motion was Willis O'Brien. In 1914, O'Brien began animating a series of short subjects set in prehistoric times. He animated his early creations by covering wooden armatures with clay, a technique he further perfected by using ball & socket armatures covered with foam, foam latex, animal hair and fur. \"Birth of a Flivver\" (1915), \"Morpheus Mike\" (1915), \"\" (1916), \"\" (1917/18), \"The Ghost of Slumber Mountain\" (1919), \"The Lost World\" (1925), \"King Kong\" (1933), \"The Son of Kong\" (1933), and, with the assistance of a young Ray Harryhausen, \"Mighty Joe Young\" (1949), yet these were but a few of the many films he animated. O'Brien's \"Nippy's Nightmare\" (1916) was the first film to combine live actors with stop motion characters. His partnership with the great Mexican-American model makers/craftsmen/special effects artists/background painters/set builders, Marcel Delgado, Victor Delgado and Mario Larrinaga, led to some of the most memorable and remarkable stop motion moments in film history.\n\nO'Brien's imaginative use of stop motion, and his ambitious and inventive filmmaking, has inspired generations of film greats such as Ray Harryhausen, George Lucas, Steven Spielberg, Peter Jackson, Jim Danforth, Art Clokey, Pete Kleinow, Tim Burton, David Allen, Phil Tippett and Will Vinton, as well as thousands of lesser known animators, both professional and amateur. Many leading science fiction and fantasy writers also credit him as a great source of inspiration.\n\nPuppeteer Lou Bunin created one of the first stop motion puppets using wire armatures and his own rubber formula. Another early stop motion piece by Bunin, also in the 1930s was \"Bury the Axis\", a short, satiric film about World War II probably commissioned for the US Government as a WPA grant. Bunin went on to produce a feature-length film version of \"Alice in Wonderland\" with a live-action Alice and stop motion puppets portraying all the rest of the characters. Bunin was blacklisted in the 1950s, putting an effective end to his commercial career. He then turned his attention to painting and drawing, while still creating numerous TV commercials using stop motion techniques, as well as a number of children's short films.\n\nOne of the more idiosyncratic early users of stop motion techniques was the American comedian and cartoonist Charles Bowers who employed stop motion techniques (which he called the \"Bowers Process\") in his series of silent short comedies in the 1920s and early 1930s. In his 1926 film \"Now You Tell One\", he skillfully uses stop motion to create such effects as a straw hat growing on a man's head, cats growing out of a plant, and a mouse firing a gun. His color film, \"Pete Roleum and His Cousins\", a promotion piece about the importance of oil in contemporary life, debuted in the 1939 New York World's Fair.\n\nThe Walt Disney studio dabbled with puppet object animation in 1959 with the release of a 21-minute experimental short, \"Noah's Ark\", nominated for an animated film Oscar for that year. Disney didn't exploit the technique until their associations with Mike Jittlov in the 1970s.\n\nDisney once again experimented with several stop motion techniques by hiring independent animator-director Mike Jittlov to do the first stop motion animation of Mickey Mouse toys ever produced for a short sequence called \"Mouse Mania\", part of a TV special commemorating Mickey Mouse's 50th Anniversary called \"Mickey's 50th\" in 1978.\n\nIn North America, Arthur Rankin, Jr. and Jules Bass of Rankin/Bass Productions produced a series of popular Christmas and non-holiday TV specials and feature films such as \"Rudolph the Red Nosed Reindeer\" in 1964, and the TV series \"The New Adventures of Pinocchio\" in the early 1960s using 'Animagic', their trade name for their version of stop motion puppetry. The specials were animated in Japan by Japanese stop motion pioneer Tadahito Mochinaga (in the 1960s) and the other Animagic supervisors in a Tokyo-based studio called 'MOM Productions'. Another clay animated children's TV series \"Davey and Goliath\", produced by Art Clokey, lasted from 1960 to 1977. Rankin and Bass also produced the puppet animation feature-length film \"Mad Monster Party\" in 1967, and combined puppet animation with live action in the 1966 feature film \"The Daydreamer\", and along with cel animation in the ABC TV special \"\" in 1972.\n\nIn the UK, Jackie Cockle is an important figure in the pre-school stop frame animation scene. She was the creative producer of the worldwide success Bob the Builder, and is the creator and producer of Timmy Time. Since 2002, Cockle has won 3 BAFTA awards.\n\nArt Clokey is best known for the clay character Gumby and for the show \"Davey and Goliath\".\n\nCorky Quakenbush created three dozen stop motion animated films for Fox network's \"Mad TV\" in the late 1990s that helped fuel a movement of comic stop motion for adults. Parodying famous feature movies and TV shows, the shorts drew their humor from the mixing of the innocence of puppets and the profanity of violence in mainstream contemporary situations. One example is \"Raging Rudolph\", written by Spencer Green and Mary Vilano, a re-telling of \"Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer\" as if directed by Martin Scorsese.\n\nQuakenbush also created \"reality animation\" to mimic hand-held documentary newsgathering for \"Clops\", written by Blaine Capatch, a parody of the groundbreaking reality show, \"Cops\" in which puppet police bust famous stop motion characters. Other parodies followed, such as \"Furious George\", a spoof of the innocent \"Curious George\" children's book series.\n\nOther notable artists include the influential Czech animator Jiří Trnka. The aesthetic tradition of the puppet film was continued by Bretislav Pojar, Kihachirō Kawamoto, Ivo Caprino, Jan Švankmajer, Jiří Barta, the (Brothers Quay), bolexbrothers and Galina Beda.\n\nA notable stop motion object animator was Germany's Oskar Fischinger, who animated anything he could get his hands on in a series of short abstract art films during the 20s and 30s. The best example is his 1934 film, \"Composition in Blue\". Fischinger was hired by Disney to animate the \"rolling hills\" footage used in the opening \"Toccata & Fugue\" sequence of \"Fantasia\" (1940).\n\nFrom the 1940s until the 1970s, notable Dutch stage designer turned stop motion pioneer Joop Geesink owned and operated his \"Dollywood Studio's\" in Amsterdam, the Netherlands. Geesink, after a dissolved partnership with Dutch comic artist and writer Marten Toonder, turned his attention towards stop motion animation. \"Serenata Noctura\" (1942) was his first endeavour, and was followed by many commercial short films for Dutch advertising broadcaster Stichting Ether Reclame (STER) and Dutch multinational electronics corporation Philips, including \"Kermesse Fantastique\" (1951), \"Piccolo, Saxo and Company\" (1960) and \"Cavalcade\" (1964).\n\nJake Fried is a painter turned stop motion animator. He became interested in the way the image changed in the course of painting. He modifies and photographs an artwork over and over to create an image that rapidly evolves over the course of his short videos, which are typically a minute long.\n\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "36364316", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=36364316", "title": "Milo Yiannopoulos", "text": "Milo Yiannopoulos\n\nMilo Yiannopoulos (; born Milo Hanrahan, 18 October 1984), or pen name Milo Andreas Wagner, is a British polemicist, political commentator, public speaker and writer. Yiannopoulos is a former senior editor for Breitbart News who describes himself as a \"cultural libertarian\". He is a critic of Islam, atheism, feminism, social justice, political correctness, and other movements. \n\nMuch of the work at Breitbart which brought Yiannopoulos to national attention was inspired by the ideas of neo-Nazis and white nationalists. In October 2017, leaked emails revealed that Yiannopoulos had repeatedly solicited neo-Nazi and white supremacist figures on the alt-right for feedback and story ideas in his work for the website Breitbart. The leaked emails also showed that his book, \"Dangerous\", and many of his Breitbart articles were ghost-written by a Breitbart colleague.\n\nYiannopoulos was born and raised in Kent. He was expelled from Simon Langton Grammar School for Boys and he studied at the University of Manchester and Wolfson College, Cambridge, but failed to gain a degree from either. He began working in technology journalism for \"The Telegraph\" before co-running \"The Kernel\", an online magazine, which was devoted to technology journalism, in 2011–13. He was one of the first journalists to cover the Gamergate controversy. In 2015 he began work at Breitbart, attracting attention for his opinions and the company's association with the alt-right. He relocated to the United States, where he became a vocal supporter of Donald Trump's 2016 presidential campaign. In July 2016 he was permanently banned from Twitter for what the company cited as \"inciting or engaging in the targeted abuse or harassment of others\", referring to a racist harassment campaign against African-American actress Leslie Jones Twitter says Yiannopoulos inspired. \n\nYiannopoulos has been accused of being an apologist for or supporting paedophilia, a charge he strenuously denies. The charge arises from a video clip in which he said that sexual relationships between 13-year-old boys and adult men and women can be \"perfectly consensual\" and positive experiences for the boys. Following the release of the tape, Yiannopoulos was forced out of his position at Breitbart, and lost a contract to publish his autobiography with Simon & Schuster. Yiannopoulos has denied that he is a supporter of paedophilic relationships and claimed that his statements that ostensibly support them were merely attempts to cope with his own past victimhood, as an object of child abuse by unnamed older men.\n\nBorn as Milo Hanrahan, Yiannopoulos was born and raised in Kent, England. His father is of half-Greek and half-Irish descent. Yiannopoulos claims his father wanted to divorce his mother while she was pregnant with him; however, his parents remained together for six more years before divorcing. He described his biological father as \"terrifying\", remarking at one point, \"I would think, if my dad is just a doorman, why do we have such a nice house? Then I saw it on \"The Sopranos\"\".\n\nRaised by his mother and her second husband, Yiannopoulos has stated that he did not have a good relationship with his stepfather. Yiannopoulos has spoken of how his stepfather would beat him up. In a previous interview, he told \"The Times\": \"My mother never really stopped that stuff happening with my stepdad. She just let it go on. I don't want to go too much into it... it's ancient history. But I did not have a happy time.\" A practising Roman Catholic, Yiannopoulos states his maternal grandmother was Jewish. \n\nAs a teenager, Yiannopoulos lived with his paternal grandmother Petronella, whose surname he later adopted.\n\nYiannopoulos was educated at Simon Langton Grammar School for Boys in Canterbury from which he has said he was expelled. He attended the University of Manchester but dropped out before graduating; he then read English at Wolfson College, Cambridge, but was sent down in 2010. In a 2012 interview, he said of dropping out, \"I try to tell myself I'm in good company, but ultimately it doesn't say great things about you unless you go on to terrific success in your own right.\"\n\nYiannopoulos is a U.S. resident alien on O-1 visa status. He married his long-term boyfriend, an African-American man, in Hawaii, in September 2017. The couple prefer at present to keep the identity of his husband secret.\n\nAfter university, Yiannopoulos initially secured a job at \"The Catholic Herald\". He was interested in becoming a theatre critic. However, Yiannopoulos' break came with his interest in technology journalism while investigating the subject of women in computing in 2009 for \"The Daily Telegraph\".\n\nHe appeared on BBC Two's \"Newsnight\" with rapper Tinchy Stryder in May 2014, discussing copyright infringement and music piracy. In March 2015, he appeared on \"The Big Questions\", discussing topics relating to feminism and discrimination against men in the United Kingdom.\n\nIn March 2017 he was nominated to stand in the election for rector of the University of Glasgow to succeed Edward Snowden, a post elected by students of the University of Glasgow in Scotland; he came fourth with 533 votes to Aamer Anwar's 4,500. He had demanded the university's Muslim Students Association be shut down.\n\nIn November 2017 he was hired by the conservative American news and opinion website \"The Daily Caller\" to write a weekly column, but was fired after his first column was published, and the opinion editor who hired him was also consequently fired.\n\nYiannopoulos organised a method of ranking the most promising technology start-ups in Europe, \"The Telegraph Tech Start-Up 100\", in 2011. It operated through an events company called Wrong Agency, started by Yiannopoulos and David Rosenberg, a friend from Cambridge University. The company was dissolved shortly after the ceremony that awarded the top start-up. Mike Butcher of \"TechCrunch\" said the main prize had been given to music streaming service Spotify, even though his casting vote had gone to the controversial payday loan company Wonga, because the Telegraph considered Wonga's reputation objectionable.\n\nTogether with university friends David Rosenberg and David Haywood Smith, journalist Stephen Pritchard and former \"Telegraph\" employee Adrian McShane, Yiannopoulos launched \"The Kernel\" in November 2011 to \"fix European technology journalism.\" \"The Kernel\" was at that time owned by Sentinel Media.\n\nIn 2012, the online magazine became embroiled in a legal dispute with one of its contributors after he said it failed to pay money owed to him. \"The Kernel\" closed in March 2013, with thousands of pounds owed to former contributor Jason Hesse when he won a summary judgement from an employment tribunal against parent company Sentinel Media. Margot Huysman, whom Yiannopoulos had appointed associate editor and was one of the people seeking payment, said that many working for the site had been \"screwed over\" personally and financially.\n\nYiannopoulos also threatened, via email, to release embarrassing details and photographs of a Kernel contributor who sought payment for their work for the site and he also accused the contributor of being behind the \"majority of damage to \"The Kernel\"\". The unnamed contributor told \"The Guardian\" that the emails had been referred to the police.\n\nGerman venture capital vehicle BERLIN42 acquired \"The Kernel\"s assets in early 2013. The website displayed plans for a relaunch in August 2013 with fresh investment and Yiannopoulos reinstated as editor-in-chief. BERLIN42 founding partner Aydogan Ali Schosswald would join its newly formed publishing company, Kernel Media, as chief executive. Yiannopoulos personally paid six former contributors money that the defunct company was unable to pay. Parent company Sentinel Media Ltd was eventually dissolved on 18 February 2014 after being struck off by Companies House.\n\n\"The Independent on Sunday\" reported that the relaunched publication, based between London and Berlin, would focus on \"modern warfare, neuroscience, artificial intelligence, pornography and space travel\" from August, but newsletter \"The Nutshell\" would not return.\n\nIn 2014, \"The Kernel\" was acquired by Daily Dot Media, the parent company of \"The Daily Dot\". After the acquisition by Daily Dot Media, Yiannopoulos stepped down as editor-in-chief though he remained an adviser to the company.\nYiannopoulos played a role in early news coverage of the Gamergate controversy, criticising what he saw as the politicisation of video game culture by \"an army of sociopathic feminist programmers and campaigners, abetted by achingly politically correct American tech bloggers.\"\n\nAs part of his coverage of Gamergate, he published correspondence from GameJournoPros, a private mailing list used by video game journalists to discuss industry related topics. Yiannopoulos said that the list was evidence that journalists were colluding to offer negative coverage of Gamergate.\n\nKyle Orland, the creator of the list, responded to the leak on Ars Technica. Orland disputed the claim that the list suggested collusion among journalists, but said that he had written a message saying several things that he later regretted. Carter Dotson of pocketgamer.biz said that the list was indicative of an echo chamber effect in the gaming press.\n\nDuring the controversy, Yiannopoulos said that he received a syringe filled with an unknown substance through the post, as well as a dead animal.\n\nIn May 2015, a meetup in Washington D.C. for supporters of Gamergate arranged by Yiannopoulos and Christina Hoff Sommers was targeted by a bomb threat made over Twitter, according to the local police responding to information supplied by the FBI. Similarly, three months later in August 2015, an event at the Koubek Center in Miami sponsored by the Society of Professional Journalists was targeted by bomb threats, forcing the evacuation of the building and the suspension of a panel with Yiannopoulos and Sommers.\n\nIn October 2015, the Breitbart News Network placed Yiannopoulos in charge of its new \"Breitbart Tech\" section. The site has six full-time staff, including an eSports specialist, and was edited by Yiannopoulos until his resignation on 21 February 2017.\n\nYiannopoulos and several figures in the alt-right participated in a five-hour online telethon to raise money for the \"Yiannopoulos Privilege Grant\". In August 2016, Yiannopoulos reported that approximately $100,000 had been received in donations and a further $250,000 had been pledged.\n\nMcLennan, formerly bursary manager of the grant, posted criticism of it on social media in August 2016, indicating it was mismanaged and that she had ceased managing the grant the previous March because she had not been paid and that the movement had ended. MacLennan sent a tweet which alleged that Yiannopoulos had transferred money intended for the grant to a personal account. MacLennan posted a screenshot of the alleged transfer to support her claim.\n\nYiannopoulos apologised for mismanaging the grant and admitted that he had missed a deadline for turning donations into bursaries. He denied speculation he had spent the money and blamed a busy schedule. He appointed a new fund administrator, and a pilot grant had been scheduled to begin the following spring, with full disbursement in the 2017/18 academic year. On 31 March 2017, the Privilege Grant website claimed that ten applicants had been selected to receive pilot project grants, though no names or supporting information was released.\n\nIn March 2018 Yiannopoulos confirmed that the fund had been closed down.\n\nIn mid-2017, Yiannopoulos launched Milo, Inc., a new media outlet \"dedicated to the destruction of political correctness\". In February 2018, after dropping a lawsuit against the company Simon & Schuster over the publication of his book \"Dangerous\", Yiannopoulos made an appearance on \"InfoWars\".\n\nWhile Yiannopoulos is openly gay, he has described being gay as \"aberrant\" and \"a lifestyle choice guaranteed to bring [gay people] pain and unhappiness.\"\n\nSome of his earliest mainstream media appearances concerned sexuality. In 2011 he debated same-sex marriage on Channel 4's \"10 O'Clock Live\" with Boy George, and a year later on \"Newsnight\". In 2013 he opposed the provision of \"Soho masses\". In November 2013, he debated with singer Will Young on \"Newsnight\" about the use of the word \"gay\" as a playground taunt.\n\nDuring an interview with Joe Rogan, in 2015, Yiannopoulos said that 'If I could choose, I wouldn't be a homosexual'. Asked if he would be willing to cure himself of homosexuality, if such a thing was ever invented, Yiannopoulos replied \"Well, it would be career suicide, but I probably would, yeah\".\n\nIn 2017 he criticised Pope Francis for his liberalism in areas such as reaching out to gay people, adding that the best media advice he could give to Francis would be \"stop talking\". In the interview he reiterated his belief that homosexuality is a sin and condemned those (including clergy) who sought to change Church dogma on the issue.\n\nKevin D. Williamson in the \"National Review\" argued that \"Milo Yiannopoulos of Breitbart London has done more to put homosexual camp in the service of right-wing authoritarianism than any man has since the fellows at Hugo Boss sewed all those nifty SS uniforms.\"\n\nThe No Platform policy of the UK's National Union of Students is intended to protect campuses from \"individuals or members of organisations or groups identified by the Democratic Procedures Committee as holding racist or fascist views\".\n\nYiannopoulos and feminist Julie Bindel were scheduled to participate in October 2015 in the University of Manchester Free Speech and Secular Society's debate \"From liberation to censorship: does modern feminism have a problem with free speech?\". However, the Students' Union banned first Bindel, then also Yiannopoulos. The Union cited Bindel's comments on transgender women and Yiannopoulos' opinions on rape culture and stated that both breached the Union's safe-space policy.\n\nYiannopoulos was scheduled to talk at Bristol University the following month. After protesters attempted to have him banned from the university, the event became a debate between Yiannopoulos and \"The Daily Telegraph\" blogger and feminist Rebecca Reid.\n\nYiannopoulos has frequently written articles that have been criticised as misogynous. In a \"Breitbart\" article titled, \"Birth Control Makes Women Unattractive and Crazy\", he asserts that the combined oral contraceptive pill causes women to become hysterical, sexually promiscuous and obese. He has also been credited as the author of other controversial articles about women, such as \"The Solution To Online 'Harassment' Is Simple: Women Should Log Off\" which focuses on gender-based online harassment and stalking and \"The Left's Bloody War on Women: Sending Chicks into Combat Betrays Men, Women and Civilization\", which criticises the involvement of women in the military.\n\nIn January 2018, Yiannopoulos reported a fictitious news story, written by a spoof news-site, as being true. The article claimed that an English High Court had ruled that the National Health Service was legally obliged to offer cervical smear tests to men. Unaware that the story of was made up, Yiannopoulos argued that the story exemplified the thinking of those living in 'feminist clown world'. Before reading out the article verbatim, Yiannopoulos insisted that he had researched the story and promised that 'this is real, I haven't just made this up'.\n\nIn December 2015, Twitter briefly suspended Yiannopoulos' account after he changed his profile to describe himself as BuzzFeed's \"social justice editor.\" His Twitter account's blue \"verification\" checkmark was removed by the site the following month. Twitter declined to give an explanation for the removal of verification, saying that they do not comment on individual cases. Some news outlets speculated that Yiannopoulos had violated its speech and harassment codes, as with an instance where he told another user that they \"deserved to be harassed.\" Others worried that Twitter was targeting conservatives.\n\nIn March 2016, Yiannopoulos acquired accreditation for a White House press briefing for the first time.\n\nFor his criticism of Islam after the 2016 Orlando nightclub shooting, a terrorist attack on a gay nightclub, his Twitter account was briefly suspended in June 2016. His account was later restored.\n\nIn July 2016, Yiannopoulos panned the \"Ghostbusters\" reboot as \"a movie to help lonely middle-aged women feel better about being left on the shelf.\" After the film's release, Twitter trolls attacked African-American actress Leslie Jones with racist slurs and bigoted commentary. Yiannopoulos wrote three public tweets about Jones, saying \"Ghostbusters is doing so badly they've deployed [Leslie Jones] to play the victim on Twitter,\" before describing her reply to him as \"Barely literate\" and then calling her a \"black dude.\" Multiple media outlets have described Yiannopoulos' tweets as encouraging the abuse directed at Jones. Yiannopoulos was then permanently banned by Twitter for what the company cited as \"inciting or engaging in the targeted abuse or harassment of others\".\n\nYiannopoulos stated that he was banned because of his conservative beliefs. In an interview with CNBC, he denounced the abusive tweets sent by others at Jones, and said he was not responsible for them. After his suspension from Twitter, the hashtag \"#FreeMilo\" began trending on the site by those who opposed Twitter's decision to ban him.\n\nIn an interview at the 2016 Republican National Convention, Yiannopoulos thanked Twitter for banning him, claiming he believed it had increased his celebrity.\n\nIn February 2017, it was announced that Yiannopoulos would address the Conservative Political Action Conference (CPAC). A conservative website, \"Reagan Battalion,\" then posted video of 2015 and 2016 clips of YouTube interviews at the request of a 16-year-old Canadian student who was opposed to Yiannopoulos' CPAC address.\n\nIn the interview in a January 2016 episode of the podcast \"Drunken Peasants\", Yiannopoulos stated that sexual relationships between 13-year-old boys and adult men and women can \"happen perfectly consensually\", because some 13-year-olds are, in his view, sexually and emotionally mature enough to consent to sex with adults; he spoke favourably both of gay 13-year-old boys having sex with adult men and straight 13-year-old boys having sex with adult women. He used his own experience as an example, saying he was mature enough to be capable of giving consent at a young age. He also stated that \"paedophilia is not a sexual attraction to somebody 13 years old, who is sexually mature\" but rather that \"paedophilia is attraction to children who have not reached puberty.\"\n\nLater in the interview, after his previous comments received some pushback from the hosts, he stated: \"I think the age of consent law is probably about right, that is probably roughly the right age ... but there are certainly people who are capable of giving consent at a younger age, I certainly consider myself to be one of them.\"\n\nYiannopoulos subsequently held a press conference, at which he said he had been the victim of child abuse, and that his comments were a way to cope with it. He declined to identify his abusers or discuss the incidents in any detail. He characterised his comments as the \"usual blend of British sarcasm, provocation and gallows humour\", and dismissed the allegation that he endorses child molestation. He alleged the video had been edited to give a misleading impression.\n\nYiannopoulos stated that; \"I will not apologise for dealing with my life experiences in the best way that I can, which is humour. No one can tell me or anyone else who has lived through sexual abuse how to deal with those emotions. But I am sorry to other abuse victims if my own personal way of dealing with what happened to me has hurt you.\"\n\nMedia personalities across the political spectrum condemned Yiannopoulos's original comments, and interpreted them as an endorsement of sexual abuse; CPAC withdrew Yiannopoulos's invitation to speak at their annual event because he had \"condoned pedophilia\" through his comments, stating that his apology was inadequate. Editorials in conservative media, including \"National Review\", The Blaze, Townhall, and \"The American Conservative\" have characterised his comments as supportive of paedophilia or pederasty. Matthew Rozsa of Salon.com wrote that although Yiannopoulos is technically correct in distinguishing between paedophilia, hebephilia, and ephebophilia, the practice he was accused of promoting \"is still illegal in most parts of the Western world.\" Margaret Hartmann of \"New York\" magazine additionally acknowledged the definitions for hebephilia and ephebophilia, but stated, \"The lowest and most common age of consent across the U.S. is 16.\"\n\nIn response to the controversy, Simon & Schuster cancelled its plans to publish his autobiography in June 2017. Media outlets reported on 20 February that Breitbart was considering terminating Yiannopoulos' contract as a result of the controversy. Yiannopoulos resigned from Breitbart on 21 February, reportedly under pressure to do so.\n\nThroughout the controversy, Yiannopoulos was criticised for [in his words] attending Hollywood \"boat parties\" and \"house parties\" in which boys he described as \"very young - \"very\" young\" were sexually abused, but failing to report the abusers to the authorities or to identify them during an appearance on \"The Joe Rogan Experience\".\n\nOn 10 March, an additional video emerged in which Yiannopoulos said on a 2015 episode of Gavin McInnes' show that child sexual abuse is \"really not that big a deal. You can't let it ruin your life.\" He mocked child sexual-abuse victims by calling them \"whinging selfish brats\" for \"suddenly\" remembering they were abused, and \"suddenly\" deciding it was a problem, 20 years after the abuse occurred. He also stated that a disproportionate number of paedophiles are homosexual.\n\nYiannopoulos is commonly associated with the alt-right. In a November 2016 interview with Channel 4, Yiannopoulos talked about his relationship with the movement – \"We're fellow travellers on some issues. But I'm very pro-Iraq, I'm very pro-Israel. There are all sorts of points of difference, I think\".\n\nIn a \"Breitbart\" article, Yiannopoulos and a co-author described the alt-right movement as \"dangerously bright\". The \"Tablet\" claimed many of these intellectual backers write for publications \"Tablet\" describes as racist and antisemitic, like VDARE and \"American Renaissance\". The Breitbart article was criticised by opponents of the alt-right for excusing the extremist elements of the movement, and also by the neo-Nazi website \"The Daily Stormer\" which holds that racism and antisemitism are pillars of the alt-right.\n\nThe Anti-Defamation League classifies Yiannopoulos as part of the alt-lite; a term used to distinguish individuals sometimes associated with the alt-right from those who are openly white nationalist and anti-semitic.\n\nA \"Daily Beast\" article in September 2016 suggested that Yiannopoulos has received funding from virtual reality tycoon Palmer Luckey.\n\nIn October 2016, during an interview with BBC, Yiannopoulos argued that the alt-right was primarily concerned with 'immigration, trade and political correctness and free speech generally'. Yiannopoulos suggested that the alt-right takes a number of different forms, from 'classical-liberals, disaffected leftists, ordinary conservatives, and this new young very energised, trolly, mischievous youthful contingent that has suddenly become interested in politics again, and that's the wing that I am most closely associated with, because that's the most exciting bit'. Yiannopoulos described this contingent of the alt-right as 'sort of unstoppable at the moment' and 'the bit of the movement that will win'.\n\nIn early October 2017, BuzzFeed News published leaked email chains from Yiannopoulos' tenure at Breitbart. According to the report, Yiannopoulos and his ghostwriter Allum Bokhari regularly solicited ideas for stories and comments from people associated with the alt-right and neo-Nazi movements. Among the figures Yiannopoulos contacted were Curtis Yarvin, a central figure of the neoreactionary movement; Devin Saucier, the editor of the white supremacist magazine \"American Renaissance\"; Andrew Auernheimer, the administrator of neo-Nazi website \"The Daily Stormer\"; and Baked Alaska, a commentator known for his anti-Semitic and pro-Nazi tweets. Yiannopoulos also was in contact and received suggestions and texts from individuals in \"traditionally liberal professions\" such as entertainment and media. Mitchell Sunderland from Vice News emailed Yiannopoulos a link to an article by Lindy West of \"The New York Times\", and requested: \"Please mock this fat feminist.\" The report also included a video of Yiannopoulos singing \"America the Beautiful\" at a karaoke bar, where a crowd of neo-Nazis and white supremacists, including Saucier and Richard B. Spencer, cheered him with the Nazi sieg heil salute.\n\nYiannopoulos has subsequently claimed that he did not see the Nazi salutes while he was singing, citing what he claimed to be \"extreme myopia\". According to the bartender who was working on the night of the incident, Yiannopoulos, Richard Spencer and their entourage came into the bar and asked to sing karaoke even though it had ended. When the bartender saw the Nazi salutes she rushed the stage and told Yiannopoulos and his friends to leave, at which point they began harassing her, chanting \"Trump! Trump! Trump!\" and \"Make America Great Again!\" According to her, Yiannopoulos was getting the others \"aroused\". The group left after the bartender's coworkers backed her up.\n\nThe story also reported that Yiannopoulos had a penchant for using personal passwords with anti-semitic overtones, such as \"Kristall\", a reference to Kristallnacht, a pogrom the Nazis initiated against Jews in 1938, and \"longknives1290\", a compound reference to the Night of the Long Knives (another Nazi massacre), and 1290, the year of the Edict of Expulsion, by which Edward I of England expelled all Jews from his kingdom. \n\nIn 2018, Yiannopoulos bragged on Instagram and Facebook that he donated $14.88 to Talia Lavin, a Jewish journalist. In Neo-Nazi and Alt-right circles, 14 represents the Fourteen Words (\"We must secure the existence of our people and a future for white children\") and 88 is code for Heil Hitler. PayPal and the PayPal-owned Venmo subsequently suspended his account.\n\nOn 26 June 2018, reports surfaced that Yiannopoulos had told at least two news organisations who had requested comments, that he wanted vigilantes to shoot journalists. According to a reporter for the \"New York Observer\", he wrote in a text message \"I can't wait for vigilante squads to start gunning journalists down on sight\". Two days later, following a shooting at the \"Capital Gazette\" in Annapolis, Maryland in which five people were killed, Yiannopoulos denied that his comments were responsible, adding that his remarks were a joke. He later posted on Instagram that he sent the messages to troll journalists. On Facebook he wrote \"You’re about to see a raft of news stories claiming that I am responsible for inspiring the deaths of journalists.\" and \"The truth, as always, is the opposite of what the media tells you.\"\n\nIn October 2018, following several instances in which pipe bombs had been sent to prominent Trump critics, Yiannopoulos posted the following comment on Instagram: “Just catching up with news of all these pipe bombs. Disgusting and sad (that they didn’t go off, and the daily beast didn’t get one)\". After initially refusing to remove the comment when it was reported as hate speech, Instagram later deleted the post. \n\nYiannopoulos was twice featured in \"Wired UK's\" yearly top 100 most influential people in Britain's digital economy: at 84 in 2011 and at 98 in 2012.\n\nIn 2012, he was called the \"pit bull of tech media\" by Ben Dowell of \"The Observer\".\n\nIn 2009, Yiannopoulos organised the London Nude Tech Calendar, which is a calendar featuring members of the London technology scene for the purpose to raise money for an organisation called Take Heart India.\n\nYiannopoulos hosted an event known as the Young Rewired State competition in 2010, which is an initiative to showcase the technological talents of 15–18-year-olds.\n\nYiannopoulos is opposed to abortion. He is quoted as saying:\n\nMilo Yiannopoulos has criticised atheism in several interviews and videos. In a discussion with Joe Rogan, Yiannopoulos blasted what he saw as the \"dreary hell of the atheist art scene\" in comparison to St. Peter's Basilica or the Blue Mosque. He further stated: \"I feel sorry for people who have this sort of bleak empty existence of militant atheism. It's just so boring.\"\nYiannopoulos was originally an outspoken supporter of the Conservative Party, but applied to join UKIP in June 2018.\n\nMilo Yiannopoulos has preached that \"Christmas and Christianity are worth fighting for\". He has stated that the Protestant work ethic was necessary for capitalism to develop and that Christianity gave Western Civilisation education and the concept of consensual marriage. With regard to the origin of modern science, Milo Yiannopoulos has stated that \"It was Christianity that prompted man to look around at the world and say this marvellous and beautiful creation of the Lord is something that God did so it must be worth us taking a look and seeing how it works. Christianity gave birth to modernity.\"\n\nIn reference to his Christianity and homosexuality, Milo Yiannopoulos has stated that:\n\nDuring an interview with Joe Rogan, in 2015, Yiannopoulos said that \"I don't believe in man-made climate change at all.\" During the same interview Yiannopoulos claimed that while working for a \"climate change NGO,\" he witnessed \"papering over of data ... I saw people omitting data sets that didn't fit with their hypothesis ... and I came to believe that the whole thing was a crock of shit and I left.\"\n\nYiannopoulos is a supporter of Donald Trump. He has been compared to Ann Coulter and referred to as the \"face of a political movement,\" but he says his real concern is \"pop culture and free speech.\" As he states: \"I don't care about politics, I only talk about politics because of Trump.\"\n\nHowever, following Trump's decision to attack a Syrian air base in April 2017, Yiannopoulos distanced himself from the President, stating that the missile strike was \"the opposite of why people voted for him.\" This sentiment was shared by a sizeable part of Trump's online supporters including Ann Coulter and Mike Cernovich, who was the first to report on the impending attack.\n\nIn August 2018, Yiannopoulos claimed that he was a “significant factor” in the election of Donald Trump as US President.\n\nIn late 2015, Yiannopoulos began a campus speaking tour called \"The Dangerous Faggot Tour\", encompassing universities in the United States and Great Britain. Although most of his American speeches were not cancelled, many were met with notable protest ranging from vocal disruptions to violent demonstrations. The journalist Audrey Goddard analysed his speech at the University of Pittsburgh, concluding that Yiannopoulos spends the \"majority of the time voicing his opinions with little to no factual statements accompanying them\", which Goddard determined was ironic taking in account how Yiannopoulos repeatedly insisted \"that he was just stating 'facts'.\"\n\nOn 24 May 2016 Yiannopoulos's speech at the DePaul University, a Roman Catholic school, was interrupted after about 15 minutes by two protesters who rushed the stage: DePaul alumnus and pastor Edward Ward, and student Kayla Johnson.\n\nThe crowd overwhelmingly began booing the two protesters, at one point chanting \"Get a job.\" The campus security team that university administrators required the College Republicans to hire the day before (at an extra cost of $1,000, part of which was paid by Yiannopoulos himself), reportedly made no effort to remove the protesters. This was in addition to further protests outside the event venue both before and after the event, which featured students reacting violently to Yiannopoulos's supporters.\n\nIn the aftermath of the incident, university president Dennis H. Holtschneider issued a statement reaffirming the value of free speech and apologising for the harm caused by Yiannopoulos's appearance on the campus. Attendees of the talk, organised by DePaul's College Republican's Chapter, criticised university police and event security for not removing the protesters.\n\nYiannopoulos later stated that he and the College Republicans wanted a refund of the money that was paid to the security team that ultimately did nothing. The university later agreed to reimburse the College Republicans for the costs of event security. Within three days, the university's ratings on Facebook became overwhelmingly dominated by 1-star reviews. This ultimately accumulated over 16,000 1-star reviews that brought the university's average to 1.1, before the page's rating system was closed indefinitely.\n\nOn 20 January 2017, Yiannopoulos spoke at the University of Washington. The event sparked large protests. A 34-year-old man was shot while protesting the event, and was put into intensive care at a hospital in Seattle, having suffered from life-threatening injuries. The man was later declared to be in stable condition. A witness recalled seeing someone release pepper spray in the crowd, which triggered the shooting confrontation.\n\nIn April 2017, prosecutors in King County, Washington filed charges against a married couple, Marc and Elizabeth Hokoana, residents of Ravenna, Washington. Prosecutors allege that the couple went to the protest intending to goad anti-Yiannopoulos demonstrators into conflict and that Marc Hokoana messaged a friend over social media: \"I'm going to the milo event and if the snowflakes get out [of] hand I'm going to wade through their ranks and start cracking skulls.\" In the message, he remarked that his wife was going to be carrying a firearm. Several witnesses said that Marc appeared to be intoxicated. The charges state that Marc initially fired pepper spray into the crowd, and when the victim confronted him, Elizabeth Hokoana shot him in the stomach using the Glock semi-automatic handgun that she had brought to the event. She was charged with first-degree assault with a firearm enhancement, while the husband was charged with third-degree assault using pepper spray. Both pleaded not guilty in May 2017 and asserted that the shooting was in self-defence. The victim stated that he was reluctant to see the couple prosecuted.\n\nOn 1 February 2017, Yiannopoulos was scheduled to make a speech at UC Berkeley at 8:00 pm. More than 100 UC Berkeley faculty had signed a petition urging the university to cancel the event. Over 1,500 people gathered to protest against the event on the steps of Sproul Hall, with some violence occurring.\n\nAccording to the university, around 150 masked agitators came onto campus and interrupted the protest, setting fires, damaging property, throwing fireworks, attacking members of the crowd, and throwing rocks at the police. These violent protestors included members of BAMN, who threw rocks at police, shattered windows, threw Molotov cocktails, and later vandalised downtown Berkeley. Among those assaulted were a Syrian Muslim in a suit who was pepper sprayed and hit with a rod by a protester dressed all in black who said \"You look like a Nazi\", and a woman who was pepper sprayed while being interviewed by a TV reporter.\n\nCiting security concerns, the UC Police Department decided to cancel the event. One person was arrested for failure to disperse, and there was about $100,000 in damage. The police were criticised for their \"hands off\" policy whereby they did not arrest any of the demonstrators who committed assault, vandalism, or arson.\n\nPresident Trump criticised the university on Twitter for failing to allow freedom of speech, and threatened to defund UC Berkeley. After the incident, Yiannopoulos' upcoming book, \"Dangerous\", returned to number one for a few days on Amazon's \"Best Sellers\" list.\n\nAccording to Yiannopoulos' Facebook post, he planned to return to Berkeley, \"hopefully within the next few months.\" He was invited by the Berkeley Patriot student organisation to appear at events, scheduled for 24–27 September, entitled \"Free Speech Week\" along with Coulter, Steve Bannon, Pamela Geller, Mike Cernovich and Erik Prince.\n\nHaving not signed contracts with various invitees for them to appear and having already backed out of its only reserved, indoor venues, on 23 September, \"The Berkeley Patriot\" notified the campus that they were cancelling all Free Speech Week activities. Yiannopoulos stated that afternoon that he and other speakers would still come to campus and hold a \"March for Free Speech\". On 24 September, Yiannopoulos, Cernovich and Geller arrived outside Sproul Hall and Yiannopoulos spoke briefly without a sound system and sang \"The Star-Spangled Banner\". Hundreds of protesters and supporters surrounded the police barricades that were erected around the plaza. Attendees were admitted into the plaza only after passing through a metal detector; approximately 150 people saw Yiannopoulos speak, while hundreds more waited in line. An \"unprecedented\" number of police officers were brought in, costing the university an estimated $800,000. Afterwards, protesters, mocking Yiannopoulos's speech, chanted, \"Immigrants are here to stay, Milo had to run away.\" Berkeley police reported at least 11 arrests, but no injuries or damage to buildings. UC Berkeley spokesman Dan Mogulof said afterwards that the media event amounted to \"the most expensive photo op in the university's history.\"\n\nIn November 2017 Yiannopoulos began a tour of Australia, with talks scheduled to be given in number of cities, including: Sydney, Adelaide and Melbourne. The exact location of the talks were kept secret until shortly before the events were due to start. These speaking events were interspersed with TV and Press interviews. Midway through the tour, promoters reported that ticket and merchandise sales were set to pass $1 million.\n\nOn 1 December 2017, Yiannopoulos held an event in Adelaide. His talk included projecting an unflattering photo of the feminist writer Clementine Ford, taken when she was a teenager, with the words \"UNFUCKABLE\" superimposed over the top.\n\nOn 4 December 2017, Yiannopoulos held several events at the Melbourne Pavilion. During one of his talks he described Australian Aboriginal art as \"crap\" and \"really shit\".\n\nPrior to the talk taking place, hundreds of protesters from the left-aligned Campaign Against Racism and Fascism and the right-wing True Blue Crew clashed outside the Melbourne event. Police in riot gear attended and two protesters — one from each side — were arrested for \"discharging missiles\". During the course policing the event, five officers suffered minor injuries, including one who was hit in the leg by a rock. The cost of policing the event was estimated to be $150,000. Victorian Police Minister Lisa Neville announced that the event's organisers would be billed $50,000.\n\nOn 5 December 2017, seven people were arrested after clashing with police and outside the venue for Yiannopoulos's Sydney event. Fans of Yiannopoulos were heckled by anti-fascist protesters who chanted: \"Muslims are welcome, Milo is not,\" and \"Nazi scum off our street\". In response, Yiannopoulos blamed the \"petulant babies\" of the left for the clash. He went to say: \"There was a lot of kerfuffle out front, it was not as the newspapers reported 'a clash between the far left and far right' it was the left, showing up, being violent to stop freedom of speech\".\n\nEarlier that day Yiannopoulos spoke at Parliament House in Canberra, at the invitation of a Liberal Democratic Party senator, David Leyonhjelm. This event took place despite efforts by the Australian Greens party to ban him. The talk was attended by approximately 150-200 people, with the majority of attendees comprising political staffers and media. Several members of the One Nation Party attended, including Pauline Hanson, Brian Burston, Peter Georgiou and Malcolm Roberts. Yiannopoulos urged his audience to reject identity politics and political correctness.\n\nYiannopoulos wrote introductions for the 2017 science fiction compilation \"Forbidden Thoughts\" and the Vox Day non-fiction release \"SJWs Always Lie: Taking Down the Thought Police\". He published two poetry books under the name Milo Andreas Wagner. His 2007 release \"Eskimo Papoose\" was later scrutinised for re-using lines from pop music and television without attribution, to which he replied that it was done deliberately and the work was satirical.\n\nAn autobiography titled \"Dangerous\" was announced in December 2016. Yiannopoulos reportedly received a $250,000 advance payment from the book's planned publisher, Simon & Schuster. It was intended to be published under their Threshold Editions imprint and to be issued on 14 March 2017, but Yiannopoulos pushed back the schedule to June so he could write about the demonstrations during his campus tour. A day after its announcement, pre-sales for the book elevated it to first place on Amazon.com's list of best-sellers.\n\nThe book announcement attracted controversy, including a statement on Twitter by \"The Chicago Review of Books\" that they would not review any Simon & Schuster books because of the book deal.\n\nSimon & Schuster dropped publication of \"Dangerous\" on 20 February 2017. The publisher's cancellation occurred in the wake of the video and sexual-consent comments controversy that also led to CPAC withdrawing its speaking invitation and Yiannopoulos to resign from Breitbart. Yiannopoulos said in response that he is suing Simon & Schuster for willful and opportunistic 'breach of contract' and 'breach of the covenant of good faith and fair dealing'. The publisher says these claims are entirely 'without merit'. In a publicly issued statement, Simon & Schuster said: \"We believe that Yiannopoulos's lawsuit is publicity-driven and entirely without merit. Simon & Schuster will vigorously defend itself against any such action, and fully expects to prevail in court.\" The lawsuit, filed by Yiannopoulos' lawyers in the New York Supreme Court, alleges that Simon & Schuster broke contract when they decided against publishing his memoir \"Dangerous\" amid the controversy over the video clip in which Yiannopoulos appeared to defend sexual relationships between men and boys. Yiannopoulos says he now was forced to self-publishing his memoir, contending that the book would have sold more copies if it had been supported by the publisher. He sought $10 million in damages from Simon & Schuster, but dropped the suit on 20 February 2018.\n\nIn a press release on 26 May 2017, Yiannopoulos announced that the book would be self-published by his publishing company, \"Dangerous Books\", on 4 July 2017. Soon after the announcement, the book became the best-selling political humour book on Amazon. The book was a \"New York Times\", \"Wall Street Journal\" and \"USA Today\" bestseller. The book further peaked at #1 on Publisher Weekly's nonfiction bestseller list and at #2 on the \"New York Times\" nonfiction bestseller list.\n\n"}
{"id": "4830276", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=4830276", "title": "Molecular logic gate", "text": "Molecular logic gate\n\nA molecular logic gate is a molecule that performs a logical operation based on one or more physical or chemical inputs and a single output. The field has advanced from simple logic systems based on a single chemical or physical input to molecules capable of combinatorial and sequential operations such as arithmetic operations i.e. moleculators and memory storage algorithms.\n\nFor logic gates with a single input, there are four possible output patterns. When the input is 0, the output can be either a 0 or 1. When the input is 1, the output can again be 0 or 1. The four output bit patterns that can arise corresponds to a specific logic type: PASS 0, YES, NOT and PASS 1. PASS 0 always outputs 0, whatever the input. PASS 1 always outputs 1, whatever the input. YES outputs a 1 when the input is 1 and NOT is the inverse YES – it outputs a 0 when the input is 1. An example of a YES logic gate is the molecular structure shown below. A \"1\" output is given only when sodium ions are present in solution (\"1\" input).\n\nMolecular logic gates work with input signals based on chemical processes and with output signals based on spectroscopy. One of the earlier water solution-based systems exploits the chemical behavior of compounds A and B in \"scheme 1\".\n\nCompound A is a push-pull olefin with the top receptor containing four carboxylic acid anion groups (and non-disclosed counter cations) capable of binding to calcium. The bottom part is a quinoline molecule which is a receptor for hydrogen ions. The logic gate operates as follows.\nWithout any chemical input of Ca or H, the chromophore shows a maximum absorbance in UV/VIS spectroscopy at 390 nm. When calcium is introduced a blue shift takes place and the absorbance at 390 nm decreases. Likewise addition of protons causes a red shift and when both cations are in the water the net result is absorption at the original 390 nm. This system represents a XNOR logic gate in absorption and a XOR logic gate in transmittance.\n\nIn compound B the bottom section now contains a tertiary amino group also capable of binding to protons. In this system fluorescence only takes place when both cations available. The presence of both cations hinders photoinduced electron transfer (PET) allowing compound B to fluoresce. In the absence of both or either ion, fluorescence is quenched by PET, which involves an electron transfer from either the nitrogen atom or the oxygen atoms, or both to the anthracenyl group. When both receptors are bound to calcium ions and protons respectively, both PET channels are shut off. The overall result of Compound B is AND logic, since an output of \"1\" (fluorescence) occurs only when both Ca and H are present in solution, that is, have values as \"1\". With both systems run in parallel and with monitoring of transmittance for system A and fluorescence for system B the result is a half-adder capable of reproducing the equation 1+1=2.\n\nIn a modification of system B not two but three chemical inputs are simultaneously processed in an AND logic gate. An enhanced fluorescence signal is observed only in the presence of excess protons, zinc and sodium ions through interactions with their respective amine, phenyldiaminocarboxylate and crown ether receptors. The processing mode operates similarly as discussed above – fluorescence is observed due to the prevention of competing photoinduced electron transfer reactions from the receptors to the excited anthracene fluorophore. The absence of one, two or all three ion inputs results in a low fluorescence output. Each receptor is selective for its specific ion as an increase in the concentration of the other ions does not yield a high fluorescence. The specific concentration threshold of each input must be reached to achieve a fluorescent output in accordance with combinatorial AND logic. This prototype could potentially be extended to point-of-care medical diagnostics application for disease screening in the future.\n\nIn a similar set-up, the molecular logic gate illustrated below demonstrates the advancement from redox-fluorescent switches to multi-input logic gates with an electrochemical switch. This two-input AND logic gate incorporates a tertiary amine proton receptor and a tetrathiafulvelene redox donor. These groups, when attached to anthracene can simultaneously process information concerning acid concentration and oxidizing ability of the solution.\n\nThe INHIBIT logic gate illustrated below as provided by Gunnlaugsson et al. incorporates a Tb ion in a chelate complex. This two-input logic gate is the first of its kind and displays non-commutative behaviour with chemical inputs and a phosphorescence output. Whenever dioxygen (input 1) is present, the system is quenched and no phosphorescence is observed (output 0). The second input, H, must also be present for an output \"1\" to be observed. This is understood from a two-input INHIBIT truth table.\n\nIn another XOR logic gate system the chemistry is based on the pseudorotaxane depicted in \"scheme 3\". In organic solution the electron deficient diazapyrenium salt (rod) and the electron rich 2,3-dioxynaphthalene units of the crown ether (ring) self-assemble by formation of a charge transfer complex.\n\nAn added tertiary amine like tributylamine forms a 1:2 adduct with the diazapyrene and the complex gets dethreaded. This process is accompanied by an increase in emission intensity at 343 nm resulting from freed crown ether. Added trifluoromethanesulfonic acid reacts with the amine and the process is reverted. Excess acid locks the crown ether by protonation and again the complex is dethreaded.\n\nA full adder system based on fluorescein is able to compute 1+1+1=3.\n\nMolecular sequential logic is exemplified by D. Margulies et al., where they demonstrate a molecular keypad lock resembling the processing capabilities of an electronic security device which is equivalent to incorporates several interconnected AND logic gates in parallel. The molecule mimics an electronic keypad of an automated teller machine (ATM). The output signals are dependent not only on the combination of inputs but also on the correct order of inputs: in other words the correct password must be entered. The molecule was designed using pyrene and fluorescein fluorophores connected by a siderophore, which binds to Fe(III), and the acidic of the solution changes the fluorescence properties of the fluorescein fluorophore.\n\nFurther development in this field might also see molecular logic gates replace semiconductors in the IT industry. Such molecular systems can theoretically overcome the problems arising when semiconductors approach nano-dimensions. Molecular logic gates are more versatile than their silicon counterparts, with phenomena such as superposed logic unavailable to semiconductor electronics. Dry molecular gates such as the one demonstrated by Avouris and colleagues prove to be possible substitutes for semiconductor devices due to their small size, similar infrastructure and data processing abilities. Avouris revealed a NOT logic gate composed of a bundle of carbon nanotubes. The nanotubes are doped differently in adjoining regions creating two complementary field effect transistors. The bundle operates as a NOT logic gate only when satisfactory conditions are met.\n\nNew potential applications of chemical logic gates continue to be explored. A recent study illustrates the application of a logic gate for photodynamic therapy. A bodipy dye attached to a crown-ether and two pyridyl groups separated by spacers (as shown below) works according to an AND logic gate. The molecule works as a photodynamic agent upon irradiation at 660 nm under conditions of relatively high sodium and proton ion concentrations by converting triplet oxygen to cytotoxic singlet oxygen. This prototypical example would take advantage of the higher sodium levels and lower pH in tumor tissue compared to the levels in normal cells. When these two cancer-related cellular parameters are satisfied, a change is observed in the absorbance spectrum. This technique could be useful for the treatment of malignant tumors as it is non-invasive and specific.\n\nA molecular logic gate can processes modulators much like the set up seen in de Silva’s ‘Proof-of-principle’ but incorporating different logic gates on the same molecule. Such a function is called integrated logic and is exemplified by the BODIPY-based, half-subtractor logic gate illustrated by A. Coskun, E. U. Akkaya and their colleagues (as shown below). When monitored at two different wavelengths, 565 and 660 nm, XOR and INHIBIT logic gates are obtained at the respective wavelengths. Optical studies of this compound in THF reveal an absorbance peak at 565 nm and an emission peak at 660 nm. Addition of an acid results in a hypsochromic shift of both peaks as protonation of the tertiary amine results in an internal charge transfer. The colour of the emission observed is yellow. Upon addition of a strong base, the phenolic hydroxyl group is rendered deprotonated, resulting in a photoinduced electron transfer, which in turn renders the molecule non-emissive. Upon addition of both an acid and a base, the emission of the molecule is observed as red, as the tertiary amine would not be protonated while the hydroxyl group would remain protonated resulting in the absence of both PET and ICT. Due to the great difference in emission intensity, this single molecule is capable of carrying out an arithmetic operation; subtraction at a nanoscale level.\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "56673259", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=56673259", "title": "Neoclassicism in France", "text": "Neoclassicism in France\n\nNeoclassicism is a movement in architecture, design and the arts which was dominant in France between about 1760 to 1830. It emerged as a reaction to the frivolity and excessive ornament of the baroque and rococo styles. In architecture it featured sobriety, straight lines, and forms, such as the pediment and colonnade, based on Ancient Greek and Roman models. In painting it featured heroism and sacrifice in the time of the ancient Romans and Greeks. It began late in the reign of Louis XV, became dominant under Louis XVI, and continued through the French Revolution, the French Directory, and the reign of Napoleon Bonaparte, and the Bourbon Restoration until 1830, when it was gradually replaced as the dominant style by romanticism and eclecticism.\n\nProminent architects of the style included Ange-Jacques Gabriel (1698-1782), Claude-Nicolas Ledoux (1736-1806) and Jean-François Chalgrin (1739-1811); painters included Jacques-Louis David (1748-1825) and his pupil, Jean-Auguste-Dominique Ingres (1780-1867).\n\nNeoclassicism in France emerged in the early to mid-18th century, inspired in part by the reports of the archeological excavations at Herculaneum (1738) and especially Pompeii (1748), which brought to light classical designs and paintings. The news of these discoveries, accompanied by engraved illustrations, circulated widely. The French antiquarian, art collector and amateur archeologist Anne Claude de Caylus travelled in Europe and the Mideast, and described what he had seen in \"Recueil d'antiquités\", published with illustrations in 1755.\n\nIn the 1740s, the style began to slowly change; decoration became less extravagant and more discreet. In 1754 the brother of Madame de Pompadour, the Marquis de Marigny, accompanied the designer Nicolas Cochin and a delegation of artists and scholars to Italy to see the recent discoveries at Pompeii and Herculaneum, and made a grand tour of other classical monuments. They returned full of enthusiasm for a new classical style, based on the Roman and Greek monuments. In 1754 they published a manifesto against the Rocaille style, calling for a return to classicism. Marigny, after the death of Louis XV, later became director of buildings for Louis XVI.\n\nThe style was given a philosophical appeal by the \"Philosophes\", including Denis Diderot and Jean-Jacques Rousseau, who called for a restoration of moral values in society, and by the Abbé Laugier, who wrote \"L'essai sur l'architecture\", a call for a return to pure and uncluttered forms of architecture. The archeological sites in Greece and Italy became mandatory stops for aristocratic and scholarly visitors on the Grand Tour of Europe. The best young painters in France competed for scholarships to the French Academy in Rome. Ingres studied there, and later became its director. In 1757 the French architect Jean-François Neufforge published \"Recueil élémentaire d'architecture\", an illustrated textbook of the style. The new taste was originally called \"le goût grec\" (the Greek taste). It called for geometric forms and decoration in \"the sober and majestic style of the architects of ancient Greece.\"\n\nIn the last years of the reign of Louis XV and throughout the reign of Louis XVI, the new style appeared in the royal residences, particularly in the salons and furnishings of the Dauphine and then Queen Marie Antoinette, and of the Paris aristocracy. It combined Greek, Roman, and what was loosely called \"Etruscan\" styles with arabesques and grotesques borrowed from Raphael and the Renaissance, and with chinoiserie and Turkish themes, Between 1780 and 1792, the style also appeared in architecture, in classically buildings including the \"Petit Trianon\" in Versailles and the \"Château de Bagatelle\" (1777). It also appeared in other art forms, including in particular the paintings of Jacques-Louis David, especially the \"Oath of the Horatii\" (1784).\n\nClassicism appeared in French architecture during the reign of Louis XIV. In 1668 the king rejected a baroque design for the new east facade of the Louvre by Gian Lorenzo Bernini, the most famous architect and sculptor of the Baroque era, in favor of a more sober and classical design with pediments and colossal columns by Claude Perrault. Under Louis XIV, the Roman dome and facade of monumental columns became the dominant features of important new churches, beginning with the chapel of Val-de-Grâce (1645-1710), by Mansart, Jacques Lemercier and Pierre Le Muet, followed by the church of Les Invalides (1680-1706).\nWhile the basic features of the architecture of these churches were classical, the interiors were lavishly decorated in the baroque style.\nIn the latter part of the reign of Louis XV, the neoclassical became the dominant style in both civil and religious architecture. The chief architect of the king was Jacques Gabriel from 1734 until 1742, and then his more famous son, Ange-Jacques Gabriel until the end of the reign. His major works included the École Militaire, the ensemble of buildings overlooking the Place Louis XV (now Place de la Concorde (1761-1770)) and the Petit Trianon at Versailles (1764). Over the course of the reign of Louis XV, while interiors were lavishly decorated, the facades gradually became simpler, less ornamented and more classical. The facades Gabriel designed were carefully rhymed and balanced by rows of windows and columns, and, on large buildings like those the Place de la Concorde, often featured grand arcades on the street level, and classical pediments or balustrades on the roofline. Ornamental features sometimes included curving wrought-iron balconies with undulating rocaille designs, similar to the rocaille decoration of the interiors.\n\nThe religious architecture of the period was also sober and monumental and tended, at the end of the reign, toward neo-classical; major examples include the Church of Saint-Genevieve (now the Panthéon), built from 1758 to 1790 to a design by Jacques-Germain Soufflot, and Church of Saint-Philippe-du-Roule (1765-1777) by Jean Chalgrin, which featured an enormous barrel-vaulted nave.\n\nDuring the reign of Louis XVI, neoclassical was the dominant architectural style in Paris and in the provinces. Notable examples include the Hotel de la Monnaie in Paris (1771–76) by Jacques Denis Antoine, as well as the Palais de Justice in Paris by the same architect; and the theater of Besançon (1775) and the Chateau de Benouville in the Calvados, both by Ledoux. The École de Chirurgie, or School of Surgery in Paris by Jacques Gondoin (1769) adapted the forms of the neoclassical town house, with a court of honor placed between a pavilion with a colonnade on the street and the main building. He also added a peristyle and another floor above the columns, and transformed the entrance to the courtyard into a miniature triumphal arch.\n\nThe new theaters in Paris and Bordeaux were prominent examples of the new style. The architect Victor Louis (1731-1811) completed the theater of Bordeaux (1780); its majestic stairway was a forerunner of the stairway of the Paris Opera Garnier. In 1791, in the midst of the French Revolution, he completed the Comedie Francaise. The Odeon Theater in Paris (1779-1782) was built by Marie-Joseph Peyre (1730-1785) and Charles de Wailly (1729-1798). It featured a portico in the form of a covered gallery and columns in advance of the facade.\n\nOne of the best-known neoclassical buildings of the period is the Chateau de Bagatelle (1777), designed and built by François-Joseph Bélanger for the Comte d'Artois, Louis XVI's brother. The small chateau was designed and completed in just sixty-three days, to win a bet with Marie Antoinette that he could build a chateau in less than three months. Marie Antoinette had a similar small neoclassical belvedere created by architect Richard Mique, who had also designed her picturesque rustic village in the gardens. It was completed in 1789, the year of the French Revolution.\nAnother notable example of the neoclassical style in Paris is the Hôtel de Salm (now the Palais de la Légion d'Honneur), built by Pierre Rousseau in 1751-83. The facade is distinguished by its simplicity and purity, and its harmony and balance. A colonnade of Corinthian columns supports the entablement of the rotunda, which is surmounted by statues. The facade is also animated by busts of Roman emperors in niches, and sculptures in relief above the windows of the semicircular central avant-corps.\nA few architects adapted the neoclassical style to more functional purposes. Claude-Nicolas Ledoux designed the Royal Saltworks at Arc-et-Senans with exaggerated neoclassical buildings arranged in circles around a central \"temple\", where the director's home and office was placed. He also designed several rotundas for the new customs barriers installed around Paris between 1785-89. These barriers became highly unpopular (due to the taxes, not the architecture) and most were destroyed during the Revolution, though those at La Villette and Monceau still stand.\n\nThe most visionary French neoclassical architect was certainly Etienne-Louis Boullée. His designs for an immense spherical monument to Isaac Newton (1784) and a vast new royal library in Paris in the form of a giant barrel vault (1785) were never seriously considered, but foreshadowed the architecture of the 20th century.\n\nDuring the French Revolution construction virtually stopped in Paris. The aristocrats fled, churches were closed and sacked. The one large project carried out between 1795 and 1797 was the building of a large new chamber within the Palais Bourbon, which eventually became the home of the French National Assembly. The École des Beaux-Arts was re-organized and reconstituted, with the architecture department under Quatremère de Quincy (1755-1849). De Quincy was an amateur archeologist and a classical scholar, as well as an architect. He was sentenced to death by a revolutionary court in 1793, but was spared by the downfall of Robespierre. He was charged with the conversion of the Church of Saint-Genevieve into the modern Panthéon, and assured that architectural studies taught the classical traditions. \nAfter Napoleon Bonaparte came to power, the most influential architects were Charles Percier (1764-1838 and Pierre-François-Léonard Fontaine (1762-1853). Their grand projects for Napoleon included the Rue de Rivoli, with its uniform neoclassical facades, modeled on the squares built by Louis XIV and Louis XV. They also designed the interior of the Château de Malmaison, the residence of Napoleon, into the model of the neoclassical style. (1803) Fontaine designed another Napoleonic landmark, the Arc de Triomphe du Carrousel (1806-1808) in the courtyard of the Louvre.\n\nOther Napoleonic neoclassical projects included the grand stairway of the Luxembourg Palace (1801) by Jean Chalgrin (1801), and the Arc de Triomphe (begun by Chalgrin in 1808, but not finished until 1836). Pierre-Alexandre Vignon (1763–1828), a student of Ledoux, was charged with remaking the Church of the Madeleine, begun in 1761 but abandoned during the Revolution, into a \"Temple of Glory\" dedicated to Napoleon's army. This project was abandoned in 1813 after a series of defeats of Napoleon's army; it became a church again, but was not completed until 1843. Napoleon also added a neoclassical facade with twelve Corinthian columns to the facade of the Palais Bourbon. It was in an entirely different style than the palace behind it, and was not aligned with it; it was aligned instead with the new Temple of Glory (now the Madeleine) which he was building, facing it, on the far side of the Place de la Concorde.\n\nAfter the final defeat of Napoleon in 1815, the neoclassic style continued to be used during the French Restoration, particularly in Paris churches. Examples include Notre Dame de Lorette (1823-26) by Louis-Hippolyte Lebas and Saint-Vincent-de-Paul by Jacques-Ignace Hittorff (1824-44).\n\nA change of style began to appear early in the 19th century, particularly after the publication in 1802 of \"le Génie du christianisme\" by one of the leading figures of French romanticism, François-René de Chateaubriand (1768-1848). He appealed for a return to the Gothic style, which, as the style of the great cathedrals, he considered was the only truly great French style. The movement toward romanticism and gothic was accelerated by the publication of the hugely successful novel \"Notre-Dame de Paris\" by Victor Hugo in 1821, and then the program of restoration of French Gothic monuments led by Prosper Mérimée and conducted by Eugène Viollet-le-Duc (1814-1879). This, along with the French Revolution of 1830 brought to a close the era of French neoclassicism.\n\nThe dominant figure in French neoclassical painting, even before the Revolution, was Jacques Louis David (1748-1825). He began as a classical and religious painter, an admirer of Jean-Baptiste Greuze, the history and genre painter. He was recommended to the Royal Academy of Fine Arts by a family friend, François Boucher, master of the rococo style. He won the prestigious Prix de Rome and went to study there in 1775. He discovered the treasures excavated from Pompeii and other ancient sites, and entirely changed his style. Beginning in 1784 he painted works based on stories from classical literature, including \"Oath of the Horatii\" (1781), a celebration of duty and sacrifice in Roman times. When the French Revolution began in 1789, David became an active participant in the most extreme wing, the Jacobins, He supported the dissolution of the Academy of Fine Arts, and designed sets for revolutionary pageants and ceremonies. His most famous picture of the period, \"Marat Assassiné\" (1793), adapted the facial expression and the limp arm of Christ in Michaelangelo's \"Pieta\" to depict the assassinated Jacobin leader, Jean Paul Marat. When the Jacobins fell in 1794, he was imprisoned twice for several months, but then resumed an active career as a portraitist and then as court painter for Napoleon Bonaparte. When Napoleon fell and the monarchy was restored, he went into exile in Belgium.\nFrench painting was dominated for years by David and his pupils, including Antoine-Jean Gros (1771-1835), and later Jean-Auguste Dominique Ingres (1780-1867). The later neoclassical painters put aside the political messages and concentrated on idealized figures and ideas of beauty; they included François Gérard, who like David, made a famous portrait of Madame Récamier, much to the annoyance of David; Jean-Baptiste Regnault (1754-1829); Pierre-Paul Prud'hon (1758-1823); Élisabeth Vigée Le Brun (1755-1842) and Anne Louis Girodet-Trioson (1767-1824).\nThe most prominent French sculptor in the early neoclassical period was Étienne Maurice Falconet (1716-1791). whose work included the heroic statue of Peter the Great on horseback in Saint Petersburg, Russia (model made in 1770, but not cast until 1782). He was named professor at the Academy of Fine Arts in Paris in 1766, and from 1757 onward he directed the modeling of small sculptures in porcelain at the Sèvres Porcelain manufactory. His work remained closer to the statues in full movement of the French baroque than the new, more serene style. In his later years he designed small ornamental sculptures of cast bronze such as the \"Seated Girl\" (1788), now in the Metropolitan Museum.\n\nThe first more clearly neoclassical major figure was Jean-Antoine Houdon (1741-1828). He studied at the French Academy in Rome,where he made detailed studies of the anatomy of the ancient Roman and Greek statues on display there. He became famous for his busts and portrait sculptures, most notably his seated statue of Voltaire (1779-81), now on display at the Comedie Française, and his busts of Benjamin Franklin and other political figures of the day. He also created several allegorical works illustrating winter and summer in a style entirely more expressive than traditional classicism, such as his \"La Frileuse\" (woman in winter), in the Musée Fabre in Montpellier.\n\nThe sculptor Claude Michel (1738-1814), also known as Clodion, also studied at the Academy in Rome between 1762 and 1771. His works varied widely from neoclassical to rococo; he conceived a terra-cotta model for an extraordinary monumental sculpture, covered with statuary of angels and cupids, to celebrate the first balloon flight in Paris (1784).\n\nAugustin Pajou (1730-1809) also studied at the French Academy in Rome from 1752 and 1756. He returned to Paris to teach at the Academy of Fine Arts, and became rector in 1792. He made a series of highly expressive statues on mythological subjects, including \"Psyche\" and \"Amour\".\nThe \"goût Grec\" or \"Greek taste\" in design was introduced in France in 1757 by Jean-François de Neufforge in his book \"Recueil élémentaire d'architecture\", which praised \"the majestic and sober style of the architects of ancient Greece.\" He offered engravings of classical vaults, garlands of laurel leaves, palmettos and \"guilloches\" (braided interlaced ribbons) and other motifs which soon appeared in Paris salons.\n\nBeginning in the 1770s, the \"style pompéien\" or Pompeii style came into fashion in Paris, based on reproductions of designs found in Pompeii, augmented with arabesques, griffons, sphinxes, horns-of-plenty and vases on tripods, interlaced with vines and medallions and painted on tall rectangular panels on the walls painted white and bordered with gilded stucco. The new style also took inspiration from the decorative grotesques of Raphael painted at the Vatican in 1510. The boudoir of Marie-Antoinette at the Palace of Fontainebleau, designed by Rousseau de la Routière in 1790, just after the Revolution began, is a notable example.\n\nDuring the French Revolution, the aristocracy fled Paris, and most of the palaces and town houses were stripped of furnishings and decoration. A new version of neoclassicism appeared briefly during the French Directorate (1795-99), which mingled elements the Pompeiian style with the Adam style from England. When Napoleon Bonaparte seized power from the Directory, the neoclassical style began to take on a new form, called Empire Style (1799-1815).\nThe Empire Style had extraordinary coherence and audacious simplicity, thanks to Napoleon's two energetic chief designers, Charles Percier (1764-1838) and Pierre-François-Léonard Fontaine (1762-1853). The motifs were usually symbols of empire, including crowns and laurel wreaths, medals, lyres, horns of plenty, and classical heads seen in profile. Rooms sometimes had the walls draped in fabric, representing the tents of an army on campaign. Interiors and furniture often featured classical columns carved of wood. Egyptian motifs and mythical beasts from antiquity, such as the sphinx, griffon and the chimera, were popular. Imperial emblems, including the eagle, the bee, and the letter N with a crown, were also common.\n\nThe first \"Greek taste\" furniture in France, made in 1756 and 1757 to designs by Jean-François de Neufforge (1714-1791) and Jean-Charles Delafosse (1734-1791), was massive, rectangular and heavily decorated, with gilded columns, friezes and hanging garlands. However, soon afterwards the royal cabinet maker Jean-Francois Oeben produced much lighter and more graceful works for Louis XV and Madame Pompadour. These were a hybrid of the curves of rococo with the right angles of neoclassicism. The chairs had curving \"à cabriolet\" legs and cartouche-shaped backs, combined with neoclassic garlands and friezes. Oeben refurnished Versailles and other royal palaces with innovative new kinds of furniture; the cylinder, or roll-top desk; the table with a mechanical writing surface that could be raised; and the drop-front desk.\n\nAfter the death of Oeben, his place was taken by two of his disciples, Jean-Henri Riesener (1734-1806) (who married Oeben's widow); and Jean-François Leleu. Riesener and Leleu produced furniture with superb wood-inlay, or marquetry, often in floral designs; and cabinets of mahogany decorated with glided bronze floral decor and column legs.\n\nIn Louis XVI furniture, particularly in the 1780s, the furniture styles became lighter, more geometric, and more simply ornamented, following the tastes of Marie Antoinette. The leading French designers during this period were Jean-Baptiste-Claude Sené (1748-1803) and Georges Jacob (1739-1814). At the very end of the reign of Louis XVI, Sené and Jacob were producing highly original and imaginative forms, including chairs with lyre-shaped carved wooden backs and the \"Etruscan chair\", a type conceived by the painter Hubert Robert for the fantasy \"rural hamlet\" of Marie-Antoinette at Versailles. The ornament on the chair, which remained popular long after the period ended, was borrowed from ancient Grecian vases.\n\nThe furniture craft was upended by the French Revolution; the aristocratic clients fled, and the furniture of the royal palaces was sold in enormous auctions; a large part went abroad. One positive development for furniture-makers was the abolition of the old guild rules; after 1791 the makers of furniture frames could collaborate with those who did the marquetry inlay. The Etruscan taste disappeared, but the neoclassic style flourished under the French Directory (1793-99), the French Consulate (1799-1804), and the Empire of Napoleon Bonaparte.\n\nThe last leading furniture designer for Louis XVI, Georges Jacob, formed a new firm with his two brothers, and, between 1796 and 1803, became the most prominent designer of the later neoclassical period. He made an effort to find classical forms that were more authentic. The type of Greek chair called the \"klismos\" became especially popular; Jacob produced a variety of neoclassical divans and stools, as well as the \"Lit de Repos\", or day bed, which appeared in Jacques-Louis David's portrait of Madame Recamier. Another popular form was the folding stool, modeled after those that were used in Roman army encampments. After Napoleon's invasion of Egypt in 1798, Egyptian designs, in stylized geometric form, appeared on furniture. Gilded bronze ornaments of extremely fine craftsmanship were made in Paris workshops and exported to the royal houses of Europe. The continual European wars and blockades made it difficult to import exotic woods, and sometimes local woods such as lemon trees were used; mahogany remained the choice for prestige furniture. The master furniture craftsmen of the late Empire style included Bernard Molitor, who made the furniture for the Chateau of Saint Cloud, and\nthe architects Charles Percier and Pierre-François-Léonard Fontaine, who made furniture as authentic as possible to Greek and Roman models for the residences of Napoleon and for clients of the new Napoleonic aristocracy.\n\n"}

Conformity assessment can include inspection and examination of a product, its design, and the manufacturing environment and processes associated with it. For example, a notified body may designate that a medical device conforms to the E.U. Medical Devices Directive, which defines the standards for medical devices. With this Declaration of Conformity, the manufacturer can label the product with the CE Mark, which is required for distribution and sale in the E.U. Additionally, the E.U. member state accrediting the notified body will then inform the European Commission that the product complies with set standards (or not).\n\nMore generally, a notified body is an independent, accredited body which is entitled by an authorized accrediting body. Upon definition of standards and regulations, the accrediting body may allow a notified body to provide verification and certification services. These services are meant to ensure and assess compliance to the previously defined standards and regulations, but also to provide an official certification mark or a declaration of conformity.\n\nThe notified bodies system used by the European Union has been publicly criticized in some capacity since at least 2008 for issues such as:\n\n\nDiscussion of further expanding coordination groups of notified bodies for different product areas, improving marketing surveillance, and making participation in standardization and coordination activities mandatory began within E.U. member states. However, more criticism would arise out of the Poly Implant Prothèse (PIP) scandal in early 2010, when media revealed that the French manufacturer of silicone gel breast implants had been using unapproved in-house manufactured industrial-grade instead of medical-grade silicone for most of its implants. Investigators also brought criticism down on notified body TÜV Rheinland for issuing a certificate of quality for a production process that didn't include the in-house industrial-grade silicone. However, TÜV stated \"its remit was to check the production process, not the content of the silicone.\"\n\nThe revelation had a ripple effect, causing both more criticism about the responsibilities of notified bodies and the regulatory process in general and more corrective action. The Central Management Committee was created in September 2010 \"to develop the effectiveness of the regulatory system on medical devices in the E.U. by improving decision making among the national regulatory authorities.\" Then in February 2012, European Health and Consumer Policy Commissioner John Dalli called upon E.U. member states to take a hard look at the regulatory system, including how notified bodies play a part. His recommendations included properly verifying whether a notified body is capable of accurately assessing medical devices, improving how conformity assessments are conducted, and developing tools to enhance medical device traceability. The European Commission acted, that September revealing its proposed changes to medical device regulation, including expanded requirements on notified bodies, to be published in 2014 and go into effect in 2017. However, the Commission also opted to instate additional reforms — separate from its draft regulations — that would go into effect much sooner, asking notified bodies to perform unannounced visits to manufacturers and expand their device testing standards. At the same time the NB-MED (European Forum of Notified Bodies Medical Devices) coordination revised their Code of Conduct due to criticism.\n\nIn late 2013 and early 2014, a French court ordered (and later upheld its decision) that notified body TÜV Rheinland pay restitution to those affected by the PIP scandal. However, this decision and a similar case in Germany has created questions about how much liability should be applied to notified bodies for patient devices found to be dangerous despite previous notified body assessment. The German case against TÜV was dismissed initially and on appeal in district and regional courts, and an appeal to a German federal court resulted in referral of the case to the Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU) for clarification \"on three issues on the interpretation of the Medical Devices Directive.\" Additionally, the original restitution decision by French courts was appealed and overturned on July 2, 2015, forcing affected patients to return their interim compensation, leaving many patients without recourse.\n\n, the German case is ongoing, waiting for CJEU input. Rudd-Clarke and Page postulated in December 2015 that if \"the CJEU decides that notified bodies are under a duty to protect patients, the practical effects could be that the CE certification process slows down, which is likely to have a detrimental impact on the cost for manufacturers of getting a product to market, while notified bodies may face a significantly increased litigation risk for failure to comply with their duties.\"\n\n\n"}

Object-based languages need not support inheritance or subtyping, but those that do are also said to be \"object-oriented\". Object-based languages that do not support inheritance or subtyping are usually not considered to be true object-oriented languages.\n\nExamples of object-oriented languages, in rough chronological order, include Simula, Smalltalk, C++ (whose object model was based on Simula's), Objective-C (whose object model was based on Smalltalk's), Eiffel, Xojo (previously REALbasic), Python, Ruby, Java, Visual Basic .NET, C#, and Fortran 2003. Examples of a language that is object-based, but not object-oriented are early versions of Ada, Visual Basic (VB), and Fortran 90. These languages all support the definition of an object as a data structure, but lack polymorphism and inheritance.\n\nIn practice, the term \"object-based\" is usually applied to those object-based languages that are not also object-oriented, although all object-oriented languages are also object-based, by definition. Instead, the terms \"object-based\" and \"object-oriented\" are normally used as mutually exclusive alternatives, rather than as categories that overlap.\n\nSometimes, the term \"object-based\" is applied to prototype-based languages, true object-oriented languages that do not have classes, but in which objects instead inherit their code and data directly from other \"template\" objects. An example of a commonly used prototype-based scripting language is JavaScript.\n\nBoth object-based and object-oriented languages (whether class-based or prototype-based) may be statically type-checked. Statically checking prototype-based languages can be difficult, because these languages often allow objects to be dynamically extended with new behavior, and even to have their parent object (from which they inherit) changed, at run time.\n"}

The business model is closely aligned with traditional car clubs such as Streetcar or Zipcar, but replaces a typical fleet with a ‘virtual’ fleet made up of vehicles from participating owners. With peer-to-peer carsharing, participating car owners are able to charge a fee to rent out their vehicles when they are not using them. Participating renters can access nearby and affordable vehicles and pay only for the time they need to use them.\n\nBusinesses within this sector screen participants (both owners and renters) and offer a technical platform, usually in the form of a website and mobile app, that brings these parties together, manages rental bookings and collects payment. Businesses take between 25% and 40% of the total income, which covers borrower/renter insurance, operating expenses, and roadside assistance.\n\nAlthough many personal auto insurers in the U.S. exclude coverage for commercial use of insured vehicles either through a livery and public transportation exclusion or a specific \"personal vehicle sharing program\" exclusion, several states in the U.S. have passed legislation allowing individuals to share their cars without risk of losing their personal car insurance.\n\nAs with person-to-person lending, the Internet and the adoption of location-based services have contributed to the growth of peer-to-peer carsharing. \n\n"}

It is a hypothetical future level of technological manipulation of matter, on the scale of trillionths of a meter or picoscale (10). This is three orders of magnitude smaller than a nanometer (and thus most nanotechnology) and two orders of magnitude smaller than most chemistry transformations and measurements. Picotechnology would involve the manipulation of matter at the atomic level. A further hypothetical development, femtotechnology, would involve working with matter at the subatomic level.\n\nPicoscience is a term used by some futurists to refer to structuring of matter on a true picometer scale. Picotechnology was described as involving the alteration of the structure and chemical properties of individual atoms, typically through the manipulation of energy states of electrons within an atom to produce metastable (or otherwise stabilized) states with unusual properties, producing some form of exotic atom. Analogous transformations known to exist in the real world are redox chemistry, which can manipulate the oxidation states of atoms; excitation of electrons to metastable excited states as with lasers and some forms of saturable absorption; and the manipulation of the states of excited electrons in Rydberg atoms to encode information. However, none of these processes produces the types of exotic atoms described by futurists.\n\nAlternatively, picotechnology is used by some researchers in nanotechnology to refer to the fabrication of structures where atoms and devices are positioned with sub-nanometer accuracy. This is important where interaction with a single atom or molecule is desired, because of the strength of the interaction between two atoms which are very close. For example, the force between an atom in an atomic force microscope probe tip and an atom in a sample being studied varies exponentially with separation distance, and is sensitive to changes in position on the order of 50 to 100 picometers (due to Pauli exclusion at short ranges and van der Waals forces at long ranges).\n\n\n"}

{"id": "416007", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=416007", "title": "Power take-off", "text": "Power take-off\n\nA power take-off or power takeoff (PTO) is any of several methods for taking power from a power source, such as a running engine, and transmitting it to an application such as an attached implement or separate machines.\n\nMost commonly, it is a splined drive shaft installed on a tractor or truck allowing implements with mating fittings to be powered directly by the engine.\n\nSemi-permanently mounted power take-offs can also be found on industrial and marine engines. These applications typically use a drive shaft and bolted joint to transmit power to a secondary implement or accessory. In the case of a marine application, such shafts may be used to power fire pumps.\n\nIn aircraft applications, such an accessory drive may be used in conjunction with a constant speed drive. Jet aircraft have four types of PTO units: internal gearbox, external gearbox, radial drive shaft, and bleed air, which are used to power engine accessories. In some cases, aircraft power take-off systems also provide for putting power \"into\" the engine during engine start. See also Coffman starter \n\nVarious power transmission methods were available before power takeoffs became common, but there were applications left wanting for some of the attributes that PTOs would provide. Flat belts generally lent themselves only to applications where the engine was stationary, such as factory steam engines, portable stationary engines, or traction engines parked in front of the work. For moving vehicles such as a traction engine or early tractor towing a farm implement, the implement could receive rotary power by taking it from one of its own wheels (whose turning was imparted by the towing) and distributing it via roller chains (to a sickle bar's crank, for example), but such a transmission ceases if the vehicle stops traveling; and the workload's resistance tends to make the wheel skid rather than turn, even if cleated. The concept of a shaft drive with easily connected and disconnected couplings, and flexibility for driving at changing angles (such as when an articulated tractor-and-trailer combination turns), was a goal to pursue.\n\nExperimental power take-offs were tried as early as 1878, and various homemade versions arose over the subsequent decades. International Harvester Company (IHC) was first to market with a PTO on a production tractor, with its model 8-16, introduced in 1918. Edward A. Johnston, an IHC engineer, had been impressed by a homemade PTO that he saw in France about a decade before, improvised by a French farmer and mechanic surnamed Gougis. He and his IHC colleagues incorporated the idea into the 8-16, and designed a family of implements to take advantage of the feature. IHC was not alone in the market for long, as within a year PTOs were appearing on other production tractors, such as some Case models. In 1920, IHC offered the PTO option on their 15-30 tractor, and it was the first PTO-equipped tractor to be submitted for a Nebraska tractor test. The PTO was a competitive advantage for IHC in the 1920s, and other companies eventually caught up with PTO implementation.\n\nInside the transmission, the exact point along the gear train where the power is taken off determines whether the PTO can be run independently of vehicle travel (ground speed). Early PTOs were often taken off the main output shaft, meaning that the vehicle had to be \"in gear\" in order to run the PTO. Later this was improved by so-called live PTO (LPTO) designs, which allow control of the PTO rotation independently of the tractor motion. This is an advantage when the load driven by the PTO requires the tractor motion to slow or stop running to allow the PTO driven equipment to catch up. It also allows operations where the tractor remains parked, such as silo-filling or unloading a manure spreader to a pile or lagoon rather than across a field. In 1945, Cockshutt Farm Equipment Ltd of Brantford, Ontario, Canada, introduced the Cockshutt Model 30 tractor with LPTO. Most PTOs built today are live. In modern tractors, LPTO is often controlled by push-button or selector switch. This increases safety of operators who need to get close to the PTO shaft.\n\nThe PTO and its associated shafts and universal joints are a common cause of incidents and injury in farming and industry. According to the National Safety Council, 6 percent of tractor related fatalities in 1997 in the United States involved the PTO. Incidents can occur when loose clothing is pulled into the shaft, often resulting in bone fractures, loss of limb, or death to its wearer. On April 13, 2009 former Major League Baseball star Mark Fidrych died as a result of a PTO related accident; \"He appeared to have been working on the truck when his clothes became tangled in the truck's power takeoff shaft\", District Attorney Joseph Early Jr. said in a statement.\n\nSome implements employ light free-spinning protective plastic guards to enshroud the PTO shaft, and are mandatory in some countries. In the UK, Health and Safety Executive guidance is contained in a leaflet.\n\nAgricultural PTOs are standardized in dimensions and speed. The ISO standard for PTOs is \"ISO 500\", which as of the 2004 edition was split into three parts:\n\nThe original type calls for operation at 540 revolutions per minute (RPM). A shaft that rotates at 540 rpm has 6 splines on it, and a diameter of 1\". Two newer types, supporting higher power applications, operate at 1000 RPM and differ in shaft size. The larger shaft has 20 splines (1\" diameter), while the smaller has 21 (1\" diameter). All three types rotate counterclockwise when viewed from the tractor (When standing behind the tractor, the shaft turns clockwise). A 10 spline type was used with some early equipment such as the 1948 Land Rover, a six spline adapter was usually supplied. It is customary for agricultural machines manufacturers to provide the nominal PTO power specification, an indication of the available instantaneous power at the shaft. Newer tractors may come equipped with 540/540E and/or 1000/1000E options that allow the tractor to power certain low-power-demand implements like hay rakes or tedders using lower engine speeds to maintain the revolutions per minute needed, using less fuel and placing less stress on the engine thereby improving efficiency and reducing costs. \n\nThe first industry standard for PTO design was adopted by ASAE (the American Society of Agricultural Engineers) in April 1927. The PTO rotational speed was specified as 536 ± 10 rpm; the direction was clockwise. The speed was later changed to 540 rpm.\n\nTruck transmissions have one or more locations which allow for a PTO to be mounted. The PTO must be purchased separately and care is required to match the physical interface of the transmission with a compatible PTO. PTO suppliers will usually require details of the make, model and even serial number of the transmission. Care is also needed to ensure that the physical space around the transmission allows for installation of the PTO. The PTO is engaged/disengaged using the main transmission clutch and a remote control mechanism which operates on the PTO itself. Typically an air valve is used to engage the PTO, but a mechanical linkage, electric or hydraulic mechanism are also options.\n\nMost Unimogs come with front and/or rear PTOs and hydraulics as well as three point hitch systems.\n\nUnits will be rated according to the continuous and intermittent torque that can be applied through them and different models will offer different \"PTO shaft rotation to engine RPM\" ratios.\n\nIn the majority of cases, the PTO will connect directly to a hydraulic pump. This allows for transmission of mechanical force through the hydraulic fluid system to any location around the vehicle where a hydraulic motor will convert it back into rotary or linear mechanical force. Typical applications include:\n\nA split shaft PTO is mounted to the truck's drive shaft to provide power to the PTO. Such a unit is an additional gearbox that separates the vehicle's drive shaft into two parts:\nThe unit itself is designed to independently divert the engine's power to either the axle-facing shaft or the additional PTO output shaft. This is done by two independent clutches like tooth or dog clutches which can be operated at total driveline standstill, only. Since the main gearbox changes the rotation speed by selection of a gear the PTO cannot be operated during driving. The vehicle needs to be stationary for operation therefore.\nOn 4x4 vehicles only the rear drive shaft is used by the split shaft PTO gearbox requiring the vehicles 4x4 drive scheme to be of the \"selectable 4WD\" type to keep the front axle drive shaft completely decoupled during PTO operation.\nIt is also possible to connect something other than a hydraulic pump directly to the PTO for example, fire truck pumps.\n\nA \"Sandwich\" type split shaft unit is mounted between engine and transmission and used on road maintenance vehicles, fire fighting vehicles and off-road vehicles. This unit gets the drive directly from the engine shaft and can be capable of delivering up to the complete engine power to the PTO. Usually these units come with their own lubricating system. Due to the sandwich mounting style the gearbox will be moved away from the engine requiring the driveline to accommodate the installation.\n\n"}

It is a form of visual communication used over long distance. In general smoke signals are used to transmit news, signal danger, or gather people to a common area.\n\nIn ancient China, soldiers stationed along the Great Wall would alert each other of impending enemy attack by signaling from tower to tower. In this way, they were able to transmit a message as far away as in just a few hours.\n\nMisuse of the smoke signal is known to have contributed to the fall of the Western Zhou Dynasty in the 8th century BCE. King You of Zhou had a habit of fooling his warlords with false warning beacons in order to amuse Bao Si, his concubine who was known as one of four ancient beauties of China. When an actual rebellion occurred, no one came to the aid of the king.\n\nPolybius, a Greek historian, devised a more complex system of alphabetical smoke signals around 150 BCE, which converted Greek alphabetic characters into numeric characters. It enabled messages to be easily signaled by holding sets of torches in pairs. This idea, known as the \"Polybius square\", also lends itself to cryptography and steganography. This cryptographic concept has been used with Japanese Hiragana and the Germans in the later years of the First World War.\n\nThe North American indigenous peoples also communicated via smoke signal. Each tribe had its own signaling system and understanding. A signaler started a fire on an elevation typically using damp grass, which would cause a column of smoke to rise. The grass would be taken off as it dried and another bundle would be placed on the fire. Reputedly the location of the smoke along the incline conveyed a meaning. If it came from halfway up the hill, this would signify all was well, but from the top of the hill it would signify danger.\n\nSmoke signals remain in use today. In Rome, the College of Cardinals uses smoke signals to indicate the selection of a new Pope during a papal conclave. Eligible cardinals conduct a secret ballot until someone receives a vote of two-thirds plus one. The ballots are burned after each vote. Black smoke indicates a failed ballot, while white smoke means a new Pope has been elected.\n\nColored smoke grenades are commonly used by military forces to mark positions, especially during calls for artillery or air support.\n\nSmoke signals may also refer to smoke-producing devices used to send distress signals.\n\nLewis and Clark's journals cite several occasions when they adopted the Native American method of setting the plains on fire to communicate the presence of their party or their desire to meet with local tribes.\n\nYámanas of South America used fire to send messages by smoke signals, for instance if a whale drifted ashore. The large amount of meat required notification of many people, so that it would not decay. They might also have used smoke signals on other occasions, thus it is possible that Magellan saw such fires (which inspired him to name the landscape Tierra del Fuego) but he may have seen the smoke or lights of natural phenomena.\n\nThe Cape Town Noon Gun, specifically the smoke its firing generates, was used to set marine chronometers in Table Bay.\n\nAboriginal Australians throughout Australia would send up smoke signals for various purposes. Sometimes to notify others of their presence, particularly when entering lands which were not their own. Sometimes used to describe visiting whites, smoke signals were the fastest way to send messages. Smoke signals were sometimes to notify of incursions by hostile tribes, or to arrange meetings between hunting parties of the same tribe. This signal could be from a fixed lookout on a ridge of from a mobile band of tribesman. \"Putting up a smoke\" would often result in nearby individuals or groups replying with their own signals. To carry information, the colour of the smoke was varied, sometimes black, white or blue depending on whether the material being burnt was wet grass, dry grass, reeds or other, and the shape of the smoke could be a column, ball or smoke ring. This message could include the names of individual tribesmen. Like other means of communication, signals could be misinterpreted. In one recorded instance, a smoke signal reply translated as \"we are coming\" was misinterpreted as joining a war party for protection of the tribe when it was actually hunting parties coming together after a successful hunt.\n\nModern avionics has made skywriting possible.\n\n"}

TESLA had a state-sponsored monopoly on electronics production in Czechoslovakia, and produced nearly all electronic products in the country until 1989. Many subsidiaries were created from the original brand, including those at Liptovský Hrádok, Hradec Králové, Pardubice, Žďár nad Sázavou, Bratislava, and Nižná. Later, some of them were transformed into independent state-owned companies.\n\nThis was officially reported by Radioamator in October 1946: Tesla the National Enterprise was set up on 10 August at the Mikrofon Factory in Strašnice with the participation of Yugoslavian Minister Zlataric Branko, Minister of Industry of Macedonia Vasilijev Georgie, Minister of Industry of B. Laušman, representatives of government, institutions and universities. The enterprise was named after a genial Slavic technician and it documents the effort for convergence and cooperation among all Slavic nations. The main task of nationalized industry is to quickly overcome all post-war troubles and woes, and to create a socially healthy and productive work environment. Then the Minister declared Tesla as established.\n\nThe company had a wide range of production: TVs, radio receivers, transistors, integrated circuits, screens, speakers, turntables, disc and cassette recorders, CD players, video cassettes etc. However, quantity usually did not meet the needs of industrial customers and many products gradually became obsolete simply because they were not updated; e.g. one particular type of diode was manufactured for over 30 years without modifications.\n\nOther products, e.g. some kinds of SCRs or Power-Transistors were competitive with the world market and so TESLA was the supplier for all eastern Europe Countries. Some high quality products were even exported to western countries, for example, the turntables NC 470 or NC 500 under the tradename Lenco.\n\nThe most well-known international Tesla product was the Tesla 308U Talisman bakelite radio designed by Igor Didov of Tesla Bratislava and made by several Tesla company branches between 1953 and 1958 and reel-to-reel tape recorder Sonet duo (1959-1965). The well-known was also military passive radar KRTP-86 Tamara (TESLA Pardubice, 1986), which was claimed to be the only one in the world able to detect military \"invisible aircraft\".\n\nTESLA had to contend with both foreign and new domestic competition after the fall of communism in Czechoslovakia, and had difficulty competing effectively, which resulted in dramatic downsizing and privatization of the majority of its stores and production facilities. TESLA's logo is a rare sight in the present-day Czech Republic and Slovakia, as only a few of its subsidiaries have survived. One of its former subsidiaries, the Slovak JJ Electronic in Čadca is known for its production of vacuum tubes and TESLA Litovel is known for its production of high-end turntables known as Pro-Ject.

The technology meets U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) standards for VOC and Hazardous Air Pollutant removal and can be used with existing pollution remediation infrastructure at refineries, chemical companies, pharmaceutical manufactures and others. \n\nEmissions of volatile organic compounds such as benzene from oil refineries and chemical plants pose a long-term health risk to workers and local communities. The EPA regulates VOCs mainly because of their ability to create photochemical smog and regards reducing the concentration of VOCs as an important health and environmental goal. \n\nVOC BioTreat expands upon existing pollution remediation infrastructure at industrial companies. It pipes biodegradable airborne VOCs into the biotreatment plant treating waterborne VOCs. This eliminates the need for a separate approach to addressing airborne emissions by using activated carbon filters and burning the residue.\n\nThe work in developing the protocols and resulting solutions on VOC BioTreat was led by Dr. Carl Adams, Ramboll Environ's Global Practice Leader for Industrial Waste Management.\n\nDr. Adams holds three patents involving advanced industrial wastewater treatment technology. He has worked with over 90 refineries in North America and around the world. He is recognized by the EPA as an expert in the development of cost-effective volatile organic compounds (VOC) control technologies, especially for refineries and petrochemical plants.\n\nFollowing the use of VOC BioTreat at the Marathon Petroleum Company’s refinery in Garyville, Louisiana, ENVIRON, whose operations preceded Ramboll Environ, received the 2011 Grand Prize in Research from the American Academy of Environmental Engineers and Scientists. The Academy said, “Refineries and chemical industries with a current activated sludge system that meet certain criteria would be strong candidates for ENVIRON’s new VOC BioTreat™ approach,” while also noting that the technology “greatly reduces capital investment” and “long-term operational costs.” \n\nIn September 2011, VOC BioTreat was a semi-finalist for the Kirkpatrick Chemical Engineering Achievement Award. \"Chemical Engineering Magazine\" has awarded this biennial prize continuously since 1933. \n\n"}

The WHRU is a tool involved in cogeneration. Waste heat may be extracted from sources such as hot flue gases from a diesel generator, steam from cooling towers, or even waste water from cooling processes such as in steel cooling.\n\nWaste heat found in the exhaust gas of various processes or even from the exhaust stream of a conditioning unit can be used to preheat the incoming gas. This is one of the basic methods for recovery of waste heat. Many steel making plants use this process as an economic method to increase the production of the plant with lower fuel demand.\nThere are many different commercial recovery units for the transferring of energy from hot medium space to lower one:\nParticulate Filters (DPF) to capture emission by maintaining higher temperatures adjacent to the converter and tail pipes to reduce the amount of emissions from the exhaust.\n\nElectric Turbo Compounding (ETC) is a technology solution to the challenge of improving energy efficiency for the stationary power generation industry.\n\nFossil fuel based power generation is predicted to continue for decades, especially in developing economies. This is against the global need to reduce carbon emissions, of which, a high percentage is produced by the power sector worldwide.\n\nETC works by making gas and diesel-powered gensets (Electric Generators) work more effectively and cleaner, by recovering waste energy from the exhaust to improve power density and fuel efficiency.\n\n\n\nAccording to a report done by Energetics Incorporated for the DOE in November 2004 titled \"Technology Roadmap\" and several others done by the European commission, the majority of energy production from conventional and renewable resources are lost to the atmosphere due to onsite (equipment inefficiency and losses due to waste heat) and offsite (cable and transformers losses) losses, that sums to be around 66% loss in electricity value. \nWaste heat of different degrees could be found in final products of a certain process or as a by-product in industry such as the slag in steelmaking plants. Units or devices that could recover the waste heat and transform it into electricity are called WHRUs or heat to power units. For example, an Organic Rankine cycle unit uses an organic fluid as the working fluid. The fluid has a lower boiling point than water to allow it to boil at low temperature, to form a superheated gas that could drive the blade of a turbine and thus a generator. Thermoelectric (Seebeck, Peltier, Thomson effects) units may also be called WHRU, since they use the heat differential between two plates to produce DC Power.\n\nShape-memory alloys can also be used to recover low temperature waste heat and convert it to mechanical action or electricity. \nA WHRB is different from a Heat Recovery Steam Generator (HRSG) in the sense that the heated medium does not change phase.\n\n\nAdvantages:\n\nThese systems have many benefits which could be direct or indirect.\n\n\nDisadvantages:\n\n\nThe Cyclone waste heat engine is designed to generate electricity from recovered waste heat energy using a steam cycle.\n\nInternational Wastewater Systems is another company addressing waste heat recovery systems. Focused on multi-unit residential, publicly shared buildings, industrial applications and district energy systems, their systems use the energy in waste water for domestic hot water production, building space heating and cooling.\n\nMotorsport series Formula One introduced waste heat recovery units in 2014 under the name MGU-H. The MGU-H will be abandoned for the 2021 due to development costs.\n\n\nWaste Heat Recovery Unit based on Organic Rankine Cycle. ENERBASQUE (http://www.enerbasque.com)\n"}

The steel used is generally a medium- to high-carbon variety and very hard and springy. Other wire brushes feature bristles made from brass or stainless steel, depending on application. Wires in a wire brush can be held together by epoxy, staples, or other binding. Wire brushes usually either have a handle of wood or plastic (for handheld use) or are formed into a wheel for use on angle grinders, bench grinders, pistol-grip drill motors, or other power tools.\n\nThe wire brush is primarily an abrasive implement, used for cleaning rust and removing paint. It is also used to clean surfaces and to create a better conductive area for attaching electrical connections, such as those between car battery posts and their connectors, should they accumulate a build-up of grime and dirt. When cleaning stainless steel, it is advisable to use a stainless steel bristle wire brush, as a plain carbon steel brush can contaminate the stainless steel and cause rust spots to appear. Brass bristle brushes are used on softer surfaces or when it is necessary to clean a harder surface without marring it. Brass bristle brushed are also used in potentially flammable environments where non-sparking tools are required. Wire brushes are also used to clean the teeth of large animals, such as crocodiles and pigs. They are also used widely in surface engineering to clean the castings to paint the castings.\n\nThe origins of the wire brush are unknown, although it is believed that the Romans used similar tools in the manufacture of roof tiles. As the Roman Empire fell, the tool fell out of use.\n\nA number of surgeons recommend that wire brushes not be used to clean barbecue grills. In some cases, bristles break off the brush which then become deposited in food cooked on the grill. Ingestion of these bristles can cause gastrointestinal perforation.\n"}

Zenith bought the rights to solar technology from Ben-Gurion University and Germany's Fraunhofer Institute for Solar Energy Systems ISE to create solar energy using mirrors and lenses that magnify and focus the sun's rays. In testing, the concentrated solar technology proved to be up to five times more efficient than standard flat photovoltaic silicon panels, which would make it almost as cheap as oil and natural gas. A prototype ready for commercialization achieved a concentration of solar energy that was more than 1,000 times greater than standard flat panels. According to Faiman, who led the Israeli team that developed the technology, 10% of Israel’s energy needs (1,000 megawatts) could be met from 12 square kilometres of land.\n\nZenith Solar was assembling solar panel kits at its factory in Kiryat Gat. The company used CHP (combined heat and power) technology which it claimed reached efficiencies of over 70%. Marketing claims included \"harvesting more energy from a smaller space, less landfill produced from their waste.\" and \"99% recyclable.\"\n\nIn June 2013 Zenith filed for bankruptcy and in December of that year they were acquired by Suncore Photovoltaics Technology Company Limited, a Chinese-US joint venture that specialises in CPV.\n\n\n"}
