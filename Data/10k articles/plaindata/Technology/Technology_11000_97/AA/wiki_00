This pale yellow crystalline solid is well known as a precursor to trinitrotoluene (TNT) but is mainly produced as a precursor to toluene diisocyanate.\n\nSix positional isomers are possible for dinitrotoluene. The most common one is 2,4-dinitrotoluene. The nitration of toluene gives sequentially mononitrotoluene, DNT, and finally TNT. 2,4-DNT is the principal product from dinitration, the other main product being about 30% 1,3-DN2-T. The nitration of 4-nitrotoluene gives 2,4-DNT.\n\nMost DNT is used in the production of toluene diisocyanate, which is used to produce flexible polyurethane foams. DNT is hydrogenated to produce 2,4-toluenediamine, which in turn is phosgenated to give toluene diisocyanate. In this way, about 1.4 billion kilograms are produced annually, as of the years 1999–2000. Other uses include the explosives industry. It is not used by itself as an explosive, but some of the production is converted to TNT.\n\nDinitrotoluene is frequently used as a plasticizer, deterrent coating, and burn rate modifier in propellants (e.g., smokeless gunpowders). As it is carcinogenic and toxic, modern formulations tend to avoid its use. In this application it is often used together with dibutyl phthalate.\n\nDinitrotoluenes are highly toxic with a threshold limit value (TLV) of 1.5 mg/m. It converts hemoglobin into methemoglobin.\n\n2,4-Dinitrotoluene is also a listed hazardous waste under 40 CFR 261.30. Its United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) hazardous waste Number is D030. The maximum concentration that may be contained to not have toxic characteristics is 0.13 mg/L.\n"}

In the context of antennas, one often just speaks of \"efficiency.\" It is a measure of the electrical efficiency with which a radio antenna converts the radio-frequency power accepted at its terminals into radiated power. Likewise, in a receiving antenna it describes the proportion of the radio wave's power intercepted by the antenna which is actually delivered as an electrical signal. It is not to be confused with aperture efficiency which applies to aperture antennas such as the parabolic reflector.\n\nRadiation efficiency is defined by IEEE Std 145-1993 \"Standard Definitions of Terms for Antennas\" as \"The ratio of the total power radiated by an antenna to the net power accepted by the antenna from the connected transmitter.\" It is sometimes expressed as a percentage (less than 100), and is frequency dependent. It can also be described in decibels. \n\nFor wire antennas which have a defined radiation resistance the radiation efficiency is the ratio of the radiation resistance to the total resistance of the antenna including ground loss (see below) and conductor resistance. In practical cases the resistive loss in any tuning and/or matching network is often included, although network loss is strictly not a property of the antenna. \n\nFor other types of antenna the radiation efficiency is less easy to calculate and is usually determined by measurements. \n\nThe gain of an antenna is the directivity multiplied by the radiation efficiency, as described in Std 145-1993. \n\nFor monopole and other ground-based antennas, ground loss occurs due to ohmic resistance in the antenna's connection to its ground plane/counterpoise, including its mast or stalk and its bonding connections, as well as the ohmic resistance encountered by radio-frequency currents in the ground plane in the vicinity of the antenna.\n\nThis is a distinct concept applied to aperture antennas such as a parabolic antenna and is a measure of the reduction in power gain caused by non-uniform aperture illumination by the feed antenna. In a typical situation the reflector is illuminated with a reduced power-density at the edge compared with the centre, in order to reduce sidelobes and other effects. This causes a reduction in gain: the ratio of the gain of the tapered aperture distribution to the theoretical gain of a uniformly illuminated aperture is the aperture efficiency. \n"}

{"id": "1313623", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1313623", "title": "Calender", "text": "Calender\n\nA calender is a series of hard pressure rollers used to finish or smooth a sheet of material such as paper, textiles, or plastics. Calender rolls are also used to form some types of plastic films and to apply coatings. Some calender rolls are heated or cooled as needed. Calenders are sometimes spelled \"calendars\".\n\nThe word \"calender\" itself is a derivation of the word κύλινδρος \"kylindros\", the Greek word that is also the source of the word \"cylinder\".\n\nIn eighteenth century China, workers called \"calenderers\" in the silk and cotton cloth trades, used heavy rollers to press and finish cloth.\n\nIn 1836, Edwin M. Chaffee, of the Roxbury India Rubber Company, patented a four-roll calender to make rubber sheet. Chaffee worked with Charles Goodyear with the intention to \"produce a sheet of rubber laminated to a fabric base\". Calenders were also used for paper and fabrics long before later applications for thermoplastics. With the expansion of the rubber industry the design of calenders grew as well, so when PVC was introduced the machinery was already capable of processing it into film. As recorded in an overview on the history of the development of calenders, \"There was development in both Germany and the United States and probably the first successful calendering of PVC was in 1935 in Germany, where in the previous year the Hermann Berstorff Company of Hannover designed the first calender specifically to process this plastic\".\n\nIn the past, for paper, sheets were worked on with a polished hammer or pressed between polished metal sheets in a press. With the continuously operating paper machine it became part of the process of rolling the paper (in this case also called web paper). The pressure between the rollers, the \"nip pressure\", can be reduced by heating the rolls or moistening the paper surface. This helps to keep the bulk and the stiffness of the web paper which is beneficial for its later use.\n\nModern calenders have \"hard\" heated rollers made from chilled cast iron or steel, and \"soft\" rollers coated with polymeric composites. The soft roller is slightly non-cylindrical, tapered in diameter toward both ends, to widen the working nip and distribute the specific pressure on the paper more evenly.\n\nIn a principal paper application, the calender is located at the end of a papermaking process (on-line). Those that are used separately from the process (off-line) are also called \"supercalenders\". The purpose of a calender is to make the paper smooth and glossy for printing and writing, as well as of a consistent thickness for capacitors that use paper as their dielectric membrane.\n\nThe calender section of a paper machine consists of a calender and other equipment. The paper web is run between in order to further smooth it out, which also gives it a more uniform thickness. The pressure applied to the web by the rollers determines the finish of the paper, and there are three types of finish that the paper can have.\n\nThe first is Machine Finish, or MF Paper and it can range from a \"Rough/ Matt\" (non glossy) look, to a Smooth high quality finish.\n\nThe second is called a Supercalendered Finish, or MG Paper (Machine Glazed) which is Glossy/ Glazed, suitable for a high degree fine-screened halftone printing.\n\nThe third type of finish is called a \"plater\" finish, and whereas the first two types of finish are accomplished by the calender stack itself, a plater finish is obtained by placing cut sheets of paper between zinc or copper plates that are stacked together, then put under pressure and heating. A special finish such as a \"linen\" finish would be achieved by placing a piece of linen between the plate and the sheet of paper, or else an embossed steel roll might be used.\n\nAfter calendering, the web has a moisture content of about 6% (depending on the furnish). It is wound onto a roll called a \"tambour\", and stored for final cutting and shipping.\n\nA supercalender is a stack of calenders consisting of alternating steel and fiber-covered rolls through which paper is passed to increase its density, smoothness and gloss. It is similar to a calender except that alternate chilled cast iron and softer rolls are used. The rolls used to supercalender uncoated paper usually consist of cast iron and highly compressed paper, while the rolls used for coated paper are usually cast iron and highly compressed cotton. The finish produced varies according to the raw material used to make the paper and the pressure exerted on it, and ranges from the highest English finish to a highly glazed surface. Supercalendered papers are sometimes used for books containing fine line blocks or halftones because they print well from type and halftones, although for the latter they are not as good as coated paper.\n\nCalendering is a finishing process used on cloth and fabrics. A calender is employed, usually to smooth, coat, or thin a material.\n\nWith textiles, fabric is passed under rollers at high temperatures and pressures. Calendering is used on fabrics such as moire to produce its watered effect and also on cambric and some types of sateens.\n\nCalenders can also be applied to materials other than paper when a smooth, flat surface is desirable, such as cotton, linens, silks, and various man-made fabrics and polymers such as vinyl and ABS polymer sheets, and to a lesser extent HDPE, polypropylene and polystyrene.\n\nThe calender is also an important processing machine in the rubber industries, especially in the manufacture of tires, where it is used for the inner layer and fabric layer.\n\nCalendering can also used for polishing, or making uniform, coatings applied to substrates- an older use was in polishing magnetic tapes, for which the contact roller rotates much faster than the web speed. More recently, it is used in the production of certain types of secondary battery cells (such as spirally-wound or prismatic Lithium-ion cells) to achieve uniform thickness of electrode material coatings on current collector foils.\n\n\n"}

One side of the tape, which is placed against the area to cover, is coated in a white, opaque masking material. Pressure applied to the other side of the tape transfers this material to the paper. Unlike correction fluid, the covered area can be written on it immediately after applying. As it is solid, correction tape is not subject to misuse as an inhalant, unlike most correction fluids.\n\nCorrection tape is sold in short spools for hand use, or as long rolls to be used in typewriters, which apply sudden pressure when a key is struck, and can therefore apply the masking material in exactly the same shape and position as the erroneous character. Some versions of correction tape are sold in separate dispensers that are used to roll the tape onto paper directly, sometimes known as a correction mouse.\n\nThe correction tapes can come in different variety of colours and designs in the current market. The materials of the tapes also varies, from having a paper-based tape that breaks easily to polyester film-based tapes that is more durable. The mechanism of the tapes differs too; the gear or the belt mechanism.\n\n"}

DFM is extremely intuitive and can be used by analysts and non-technical users as well. A short-term working is sufficient to realize a clear and exhaustive representation of multidimensional concepts (e.g., attributes, measures and hierarchies). It can be used from the initial DW life-cycle steps, to rapidly devise a conceptual model to share with customers.\n\nData warehouses (DWs) are databases used by decision makers to \"analyze\" the status and the development of an organization. DWs are based on large amounts of data integrated from heterogeneous sources into multidimensional databases, and they are optimized for accessing data in a way that comes naturally to human analysts (e.g., OLAP applications).\n\nData in a DW are organized according to the multidimensional model, that hinges on the concepts of fact (a focus of interest for the decision-making process, such as sales and orders) and dimension (a coordinate for analyzing a fact, such as time, customer, and product). Each fact is quantified through a set of numerical measures, such as the quantity of product sold, the price of products, etc.\n\nDW design and development require ad hoc methodologies and an appropriate life-cycle.\n\nThe DFM is a graphical conceptual model, specifically devised for multidimensional design, in order to:\n\nThe conceptual representation generated by the DFM consists of a set of fact schemata. Fact schemata model facts, measures, dimensions, and hierarchies (Figure 1). Besides these basic elements, the DFM includes a large set of constructs for expressing the multitude of conceptual nuances that characterize actual modeling scenarios in projects of small to large complexity. A multidimensional schema modeled with the DFM can easily (i.e., semi-automatically) be implemented on both ROLAP and MOLAP platforms.\n\nA \"fact\" is a concept relevant to decision-making processes. It typically models a set of events taking place within a company. Examples of facts in the commercial domain are sales, shipments, purchases, and complaints.\n\nA \"measure\" is a numerical property of a fact and describes a quantitative attribute that is relevant to analysis. For example, each sale is measured by the number of units sold, the unit price, and the total receipts.\n\nA \"dimension\" is a property, with a finite domain, that describes an analysis coordinate of the fact. A fact generally has multiple dimensions that define its minimum representation granularity. Typical dimensions for the sales fact are products, stores, and dates; in which case, the basic information that can be represented is product sales in one store in one day.\n\nA \"fact\" is represented by a box that displays the fact name along with the measure names. Small circles represent the dimensions, which are linked to the fact by straight lines (see Figure 1).\n\nA \"dimensional attribute\" is a property, with a finite domain, of a dimension. Like dimensions, a dimensional attribute is represented by a circle. For instance, a product may be described by its type, category, and brand; a customer may be represented by city and nation. The relationships among the dimensional attributes are expressed by hierarchies.\n\nA \"hierarchy\" is a directed tree whose nodes are dimensional attributes and whose arcs model many-to-one associations between dimensional attribute pairs. A hierarchy includes a dimension, positioned at the tree's root, and all of the dimensional attributes that describe it. Arcs are graphically represented by straight lines that connect dimensional attributes. Hierarchies define the way elemental business events can be selected and aggregated for decision-making processes.\n\nA \"descriptive attribute\" specifies a property of a dimension attribute, to which it is related by a x-to-one association. Descriptive attributes cannot be used for aggregation; they are always leaves of a hierarchy and are graphically represented by horizontal lines, like \"telephone number\" in Figure 2.\n\nA \"cross-dimensional attribute\" is a dimensional or descriptive attribute whose value is defined by the combination of two or more dimensional attributes, possibly belonging to different hierarchies. For example, if a product value added tax (VAT) depends both on the product category and on the country where the product is sold, you can use a cross-dimensional attribute to represent it. Figure 2 shows this example by joining the arcs that define a product VAT with a circular arc.\n\nA \"convergence\" takes place when two dimensional attributes within a hierarchy are connected by two or more alternative paths of many-to-one associations. Convergences are represented by letting two or more arcs reach the same dimensional attribute. For instance, in Figure 2 the geographic hierarchy on the customer dimension contains a convergence if we assume that, though no inclusion relationships exists between districts and cities/states, sales districts never cross the nation boundaries. In this case, each customer belongs to exactly one nation whichever of the two paths is followed.\n\n\"Optional arcs\" are used to model scenarios for which an association represented in a fact schema is not defined for a subset of events. Optional arcs are marked with a dash. For instance, attribute \"diet\" in Figure 2 takes a value (such as cholesterol-free, gluten-free, or sugar-free) only for food products; for the other products, it is undefined.\n\nA \"multiple arc\" models a many-to-many association between the two dimensional attributes it connects. Graphically, it is denoted by doubling the line that represents the arc. Consider the fact schema modeling the sales of books, represented in Figure 3, whose dimensions are date and book. It would certainly be interesting to aggregate and select sales on the basis of book authors. However, it would not be accurate to model author as a dimensional child attribute of book because a book may have more than one author, and authors can write more than one book. Hence, the relationship between books and authors is modeled as a multiple arc.\n"}

She campaigned successfully to have some of her female trainees accepted into the all-male Navy, thereby originating the Women's Royal Australian Naval Service (WRANS). Some 12,000 servicemen passed through her signal instruction school in Sydney, acquiring skill in Morse code and visual signalling (flag semaphore and International Code of Signals).\n\nShe set up her own electrical contracting business in 1918, and apprenticed herself to it, in order to meet the requirements of the Diploma in Electrical Engineering at Sydney Technical College and in 1922 she was the first Australian woman to take out an amateur radio operator's license. Through the 1920s and 1930s, her \"Wireless Shop\" in Sydney's Royal Arcade was renowned amongst Sydney radio experimenters and hobbyists. She founded \"The Wireless Weekly\" in 1922, established the Electrical Association for Women in 1934, and wrote the first \"all-electric cookbook\" in 1936. She also corresponded with Albert Einstein in the postwar years.\n\nFlorence Violet McKenzie was born Florence Violet Granville on 28 September 1890 in Melbourne, although before her marriage to Cecil McKenzie at the age of 34, she was known as Violet Wallace. Other sources cite 1892 as her birth year. Wallace was her stepfather George's surname; he was a commercial traveller. When Violet was an infant, the family moved to Austinmer, south of Sydney.\n\nFrom a young age, Violet had an independent interest in electricity and invention. As she recalled in an oral history interview in 1979:\nI used to play about with bells and buzzers and things around the house. My mother would sometimes say \"Oh, come and help me find something, it's so dark in this cupboard\" – she didn't have very good eyesight… So I'd get a battery and I'd hook a switch, and when she opened that cupboard door a light would come on… I started sort of playing with those things.\n\nFrom Thirroul school, McKenzie won a bursary to study at Sydney Girls' High School. In 1915 she passed Chemistry I and Geology I at the University of Sydney, then approached the Sydney Technical College in Ultimo to enrol in the Diploma of Electrical Engineering. By March 1922, she had won the diploma. In December 1923, McKenzie graduated from the Sydney Technical College. She later gave her Diploma – the first of its kind awarded in Australia to a woman – to the collection of the Powerhouse Museum, also in Ultimo.\nCecil Roland McKenzie was a young electrical engineer employed by the Sydney County Council's Electricity Undertaking. He too was a radio enthusiast, and one of Violet's customers at the shop. They were married at the Church of St Philip in Auburn on New Year's Eve 1924. They built a house at 26 George Street, Greenwich Point complete with a wireless room in the attic. The house remains, but has been extensively renovated since the McKenzies lived there.\n\nThe McKenzies had a daughter, stillborn, in 1926. They sometimes took in the two sons of Violet's only sibling, Walter Reginald Wallace, from Melbourne. According to the Sands Directory these boys, Merton Reginald Wallace and Lindsay Gordon Wallace, later operated their own radio shop in Prahran, Melbourne.\n\nViolet taught mathematics at Armadale, before deciding to take a course in electrical engineering. Throughout her studies, Miss Wallace worked as an electrical contractor, installing electricity in private houses, such as that of politician Archdale Parkhill in Mosman, and in factories and commercial premises, including the Standard Steam Laundry on Dowling Street, Woolloomooloo. She was an enthusiastic ham radio operator, being the first licensed woman in the country and with the call sign \"2GA\" (later changed to \"VK2FV\"). In 1922 Miss Wallace opened \"The Wireless Shop\", after purchasing the entire stock of the wireless vendor who preceded her – billing itself as \"the oldest radio shop in town\" – in the Royal Arcade (which ran from George Street through to Pitt Street – replaced in the 1970s by the Hilton hotel). McKenzie later said it was schoolboys visiting her shop who first introduced her to Morse code. Australia's first weekly radio magazine was conceived at the shop, by Miss Wallace and three co-founders. \"The Wireless Weekly\" became the monthly magazine \"Radio & Hobbies\", then \"Radio, Television & Hobbies\", and finally Electronics Australia, and remained in circulation until 2001.\nIn 1924 McKenzie became the only female member of the Wireless Institute of Australia. That same year she travelled to the United States for business reasons, and in San Francisco was welcomed at radio 6KGO: 'Miss Wallace, an electrical engineer from Australia, will now talk from the studio.' She reportedly used her time on air to comment on the difference between the tram systems in San Francisco and those in Sydney. In 1931 she also notes that she experimented with improving the science of television through the use of chemistry:\n\n\"[I] have a pronounced kink for television work and devote most of my spare time in experimenting that branch of the science. Have a deep-rooted conviction that chemistry is going to provide the solution and am working along those lines.\"\nThe McKenzies had a mutual interest in tropical fish and had an enormous fish pond in the front yard. She spoke of heating water electrically to house tropical fish at home in the early 1920s, and of having given talks on radio 2FC about tropical fish in the days when she was doing electrical contracting work. In January 1933 the American journal Aquariana published an article written by McKenzie concerning 'Some interesting inhabitants of Sydney seashores', in which she recommended keeping sea horses in a salt-water tank.\n\nIn the 1930s, McKenzie turned her attention increasingly to teaching other women about electricity and radio. She had observed the need over years of working in the field herself. In 1925, she told the \"Australian Woman's Mirror\": \"[T]here are such a lot of women experimenters [amongst my customers] that I would like to form a Women's Wireless Club.\" In 1931 she told a Sunday Sun reporter that she wanted to see a course of lectures on domestic radio and electricity established in girls' schools and technical colleges. The following year she took matters into her own hands, opening a Women's Radio College on Phillip Street in 1932. She persuaded employers to take on some of her trainees, as one of them later recalled:\n\nDuring the Depression I joined Mrs Mac's electrical school in Phillip Street. It was the first time girls were involved with electrical circuits, Morse and making radio sets. Later Mrs Mac decided it was time to use our skills in industry, so she persuaded Airzone Ltd to take one of us (me) on trial in their radio section. Soon the others followed from the school, and we started the component parts section, and we were absorbed into many other sections.\n\nMcKenzie believed that electricity could save women from domestic drudgery, writing that... \"To see every woman emancipated from the \"heavy\" work of the household by the aid of electricity is in itself a worthy object.\" To this end in 1934 she founded an educational initiative, the Electrical Association for Women (EAW) at 170 King Street in the centre of Sydney, later moving a few blocks away to 9 Clarence Street.\n\nConcerned with safety when using electrical appliances, and no doubt drawing on her own experience in receiving an accidental electric shock that knocked her out for an hour, McKenzie delivered at least one talk on resuscitation, advising that conventional resuscitation should proceed for up to thee-quarters of an hour following electrocution. She knew of one case where recovery took 4 hours.\n\nBy 1936, McKenzie had sold the Wireless Shop, and was busy at the Electrical Association for Women. She gave electric cooking demonstrations in the EAW kitchen, which was fitted out with show electrical appliances by the Sydney County Council. She compiled the EAW Cookery Book, Australia's first \"all-electric\" cookery book, which ran into seven editions and remained in print until 1954. She wrote an illustrated book for children about electrical safety called \"The Electric Imps\" in 1938.\n\nIn July 1938, McKenzie was one of 80 women in attendance at the inaugural meeting of the Australian Women's Flying Corps (later known as the Australian Women's Flying Club) held at the Feminist Club of New South Wales at 77 King Street. McKenzie was appointed treasurer and instructor in Morse code to the organisation.\n\nIn 1939 McKenzie established the Women's Emergency Signalling Corps (WESC) in her Clarence Street rooms – known affectionately as \"Sigs\". Her original idea was to train women in telegraphy so that they could replace men working in civilian communications, thereby freeing those skilled men up to serve in the war. By the time war broke out, 120 women had been trained to instructional standard.\n\nMcKenzie campaigned energetically to have some of her female trainees accepted into the Air Force and Navy as telegraphists. She encountered a great deal of official resistance. In 1940 she wrote to the Minister of the Navy, former Prime Minister WM (Billy) Hughes, saying \"I would like to offer the services of our Signalling Corps, if not acceptable as telegraphists then at least as instructors.\" Despite her suggestion being dismissed, some time later McKenzie and six trainees were provided third-class train tickets to Melbourne to meet with the Naval Board for testing.\n\nIn early January 1941, Commander Newman, the Navy's Director of Signals and Communications, visited the WESC headquarters on Clarence Street to test McKenzie's trainees. Finding they were highly proficient, he recommended the Navy admit them. Hughes still took some convincing. After McKenzie threatened to take her offer to the Air Force instead, the urgent need for trained telegraphists prevailed, and on 21 April a Navy Office letter authorised the entry of women into the Navy. This was the beginning of the Women's Royal Australian Naval Service – the WRANS. The minister's condition was that \"no publicity...be accorded this break with tradition\".\n\nOn 28 April 1941, McKenzie accompanied 14 of her WESC trainees (twelve telegraphists and two domestic helpers). They had their medical test on 25 April and arrived at in Canberra on 28 April 1941. The women were dressed in their green WESC uniform which had been designed by McKenzie herself – it was several months before a female Navy uniform was ready. Francis Proven became WRANS number 1. From this initial intake of 14, the WRANS ranks expanded to some 2,600 by the end of the war, representing about 10 per cent of the entire Royal Australian Naval force at the time. All told, McKenzie trained about 3,000 women, one-third of whom went into the services. Many others remained at the Clarence Street school as instructors.\n\nIn May 1941, the Air Force appointed McKenzie as an honorary flight officer of the Women's Auxiliary Australian Air Force, so she could legitimately instruct Air Force personnel. This was the only official recognition McKenzie received during the war for her efforts.\n\nViolet McKenzie helped with rehabilitation after the war, keeping her school open for as long as there was a need for instruction in wireless signalling. In the postwar years, she trained men from the merchant navy, pilots in commercial aviation, and others needing the trade qualification known as a \"signaller's ticket\". In 1948, a reporter from \"Sky Script\" visit to the school and described the scene, and the diversity of students:\nAt a table in a corner recently there were six elementary trainees: One was a Chinese quartermaster, another a half-Burmese. Two were Americans … One … an aircraft skipper down from New Guinea to get his wireless ticket; and the other chap a ship's officer with the same objective. In another corner there's an ANA commander preparing for his 20-word-a-minute exam: an English ship's wireless officer...an ex-RAF Wing-Commander...an Indian Navy man... [and] groups of airline 'types' also on the job.\n\nMcKenzie told a journalist that, after the war, \"All the airmen came back and wanted to join Qantas, but they needed to build up their Morse speed and learn to use the modern equipment.\" The Department of Civil Aviation fitted out a room at the school with transmitters, receivers and radio compass so that pilots could train for their wireless ticket at the school. From 1948, McKenzie held a First Class Flight Radio Telephony Operator License.\n\nOne of the ex-RAAF airmen who retrained for a civilian career with McKenzie wrote:\nBeing unemployed, we spent almost all of each weekday at the school, so if a tuition fee had been applicable, Mrs Mac would have earned a tidy sum of money. That, of course, was not her way of doing things. She required no payment for the training she provided, and I suspect that she was quite out of pocket over the whole affair... It would be true to say that a great number of the pilots whose futures were finally fulfilled in airlines in Australia owe a deal to Mrs Mac... There was no other school operating in Sydney at the time, providing Morse training to potential airline pilots, and no other school then or thereafter giving such training completely free of charge.\n\nFamous aviators who trained for their wireless ticket at McKenzie's school include Patrick Gordon Taylor and Cecil Arthur Butler. McKenzie also trained Mervyn Wood, later Commissioner of Police in New South Wales, and the principals of the Navigation Schools at both the Melbourne and Sydney Technical Colleges.\n\nAccording to a People magazine profile of McKenzie written in January 1953, McKenzie received an unceremonious notice from the owners of 10 Clarence Street to quit the premises. The Sands Directory indicates that she moved her operation briefly to No 6 Wharf at Circular Quay in 1953, before retiring to her home at Greenwich Point in 1954. McKenzie wrote that she closed the school when the airlines established their own school and the government added a signals training section to the Navigation School at the Technical College. She continued to help the occasional pupil with special difficulties at her home.\n\nIn early 1949 McKenzie started writing to Albert Einstein. Her first letter to him wished him a speedy recovery from recent illness. Two of her letters are held in the Einstein archives in Jerusalem. It is clear from the second letter that he wrote back to her at least once. Some accounts claim that McKenzie corresponded regularly with Einstein for as long as 15 years before his death in 1955, but the documentary record suggests such reports exaggerate the extent of the correspondence. She also sent him several gifts over the years including shells (for his daughter) that airmen would collect across the Pacific on her request and a boomerang which had been brought to her from Central Australia by an airline pilot. She wrote that, \"Some of your mathematical friends might like to plot its flight!\" There are other reports that she sent him a didgeridoo, and a recording of didgeridoo music when he replied that he couldn't work out how to play the instrument.\n\nOn 8 June 1950, McKenzie was appointed an Officer of the Order of the British Empire (OBE) for her work with the WESC. In 1957 she was elected a Fellow of the Australian Institute of Navigation. In 1964 she became Patron of the Ex-WRANS Association. In 1979 she was made a Member of the Royal Naval Amateur Radio Society. In 1980 a plaque celebrating her \"skills, character and generosity\" was unveiled at the Missions to Seamen Mariners' Church, Flying Angel House. The Church has since relocated to 320 Sussex St, where the plaque can be seen in the garden.\n\nViolet McKenzie was nine years older than her husband Cecil, but she outlived him by 23 years. After his death in 1958, she shared her house for a time with Cecil's sister Jean, a primary school teacher. In May 1977, after a stroke paralysed her right side and confined her to a wheelchair, McKenzie moved to the nearby Glenwood Nursing Home. She died peacefully in her sleep on 23 May 1982. At her funeral service, held at the Church of St Giles in Greenwich, 24 serving WRANS formed a Guard of Honour. McKenzie was cremated at the Northern Suburbs Crematorium. The June 1982 edition of the newsletter of the Ex-WRANS Association was devoted to their former teacher and patron. Amongst the memories recorded therein is a statement McKenzie made two days before she died: \"...it is finished, and I have proved to them all that women can be as good as, or better than men.\"\n\n\n\n\"This Wikipedia article is substantially built upon the essay \"McKenzie, Violet\" in the Dictionary of Sydney <br>written by Catherine Freyne, 2010 and licensed under CC by-sa.

Davis's father was Dr. Donald Davis (deceased), an IBM Fellow and the creator of the \"learning organization\" management practice (while a professor at the University of Utrecht in the Netherlands). Davis's mother was Doris Davis (deceased), an educator, artist, and longtime director of the Upward Bound project at Bowdoin College, in Brunswick, Maine.\n\nDavis attended Friends Academy, in Locust Valley, New York, from kindergarten through sixth grade, while his mother was an English teacher and assistant principal. In 1966 Davis enrolled at Eaglebrook School, in Deerfield, Massachusetts, where he spent grades 7 through 9 and graduated in 1970. In 1966 Davis, then age 11, learned computer programming, by participating in the testing and development of the BASIC computer language via a time-sharing hookup to Dartmouth College, where BASIC was being developed. In 1970 Davis enrolled at Northfield Mt. Hermon School, in Northfield, Massachusetts, where he spent his sophomore and junior years. He spent his senior year of high school at Collins Brook School, in Freeport, Maine. The school was modeled after and run by former educators of the progressive Summerhill School in Suffolk, England. Davis graduated in 1973 from Collins Brook, where his senior class consisted of only six people. In 1978 Davis enrolled in Antioch College and completed his B.A. in Botany. The \"Wall St. Journal\" described Davis as \"a teen-age prodigy who earned a B.A. in only one year.\" In 1979 Davis continued at Antioch College, and he earned his M.S. in Ecosystems Management in 1981. In 1980 Davis enrolled at Union Institute & University as a degree candidate for a PhD in Information Technology. His dissertation was titled \"Computer Assisted Publishing,\" and although Davis did not complete his PhD, the dissertation formed the groundwork for a book he coauthored—\"Desktop Publishing\"—one of the first books to be published on that topic.\n\nIn 1974 Davis bought Lougee's, a greenhouse and florist business in Belfast, Maine. He expanded the business to include North Star Orchids, an orchid nursery that was a major importer of orchids in 1975 and 1976. During that time, he designed and established a commercial plant tissue culture laboratory for North Star Orchids; the lab was one of the first commercial plant tissue culture labs to use a laminar flow hood based on millipore filters for aseptic lab work, at a time when glove boxes were the standard aseptic tissue culture work areas. Davis invented a new type of plant tissue culture vessel based on millipore filters for respiration, and that invention was published in \"Orchid Review\", where it received international attention. It was cited in subsequent scientific papers and eventually became part of the standard design of almost all types of labware that needed to provide aseptic respiration.\n\nIn the late '70s, Davis moved from Maine to San Francisco, where he became one of the early personal computer pioneers working with CPM-based systems. Davis bought an original Apple II in 1977 and emerged as an early Apple II programmer, due to his prior knowledge of BASIC, the language that computer used. Davis was among the first computer engineers to successfully connect microcomputers to mainframes, connecting his Apple II with Stanford's DEC PDP-10 while conducting research on database publishing at Stanford. Davis also served as a computer consultant to large corporations and venture capitalists in the early days of the industry.\n\nDavis held several executive positions at technology magazines from 1983 to 2002. Davis was the editor of \"A+\", \"MacUser\", \"PC Magazine\", and \"PC Week\"; a columnist and writer for \"Wired\"; and the publisher of \"dig_iT\".\n\nIn 1983 Davis became one of the founders of Ziff-Davis's computer publishing division and worked on the startup of ZD's first computer publication, \"A+\", which rapidly became the leading publication about Apple computers. Later, during Fred's tenure as editor-in-chief, \"A+\" won the Computer Press Association award for Best Computer Magazine. From \"A+\", Davis moved over to serve as editor-in-chief of its sister magazine \"MacUser\", where he founded MacUser Labs. He oversaw the development of the magazine during its period of greatest growth, bringing it up to parity with \"Macworld\".\n\nNext, Davis joined \"PC Magazine\", which, at the time, was the world's leading computer publication in terms of revenue and circulation, with an annual revenue of approximately $250 million. As editor of \"PC Magazine\" and director of PC Magazine Labs, he helped develop benchmarks and scripts for testing thousands of products under review. Later, as editor of \"PC Week\", he founded PC Week Labs and developed industry-standard benchmark tests for corporate computing. After leaving \"PC Week,\" which was located in Massachusetts, to return to California, Davis helped launch and served as a columnist for several other Ziff-Davis publications, including \"Windows Sources\", \"Computer Life\", \"Family PC\", and the ZD Personal Computing newspaper supplement.\n\nIn 1992 Davis worked with \"Wired\" CEO Louis Rosetto on the launch of \"Wired\" magazine and was part of the original \"\"Wired\" Brain Trust.\" After \"Wired\", Davis worked with CNET CEO Halsey Minor as an original member of the CNET startup team, where he helped develop both television and online strategies.\n\nIn 2001 Davis and computer publishing pioneer David Bunnell founded Prosumer Media, the publisher of \"dig_iT\", a magazine focused on \"the digital lifestyle.\"\n\nDavis was an early Internet pioneer who launched one of the Internet's first curated search and discovery sites, Weblust.com. Early users of Weblust included Ralph Nader and Avram Miller.\n\nWorking with CMP Media, Davis led a team that developed an advanced consumer portal and Internet search site named NetGuide. It included multimedia features and games such as \"Where's Barlowe?\" based on the travelings of John Perry Barlow. These features were developed by Marc Canter, founder of MacroMind/MacroMedia, and David Biedney, a highly acclaimed graphic artist. NetGuide was one of the first major consumer Web projects to use Java. One of the programmers on the NetGuide project was Craig Newmark, who later went on to start Craigslist.\n\nIn 1994 Davis joined CNET during its early startup stage. He was the first computer industry person to join the CNET team, which at the time consisted of Halsey Minor, Shelby Bonnie, and their administrative assistant. Davis worked with Fox Network cofounder Kevin Wendle and former Disney creative associate Dan Baker to produce CNET's four pilot television programs about computers, technology, and the Internet.\n\nIn 1996 Davis helped launch Ask Jeeves (now Ask.com), after venture capitalist Garrett Gruener introduced Davis to David Warthen, the founding CEO.\n\nIn 1998 Davis was the CEO and founder of Lumeria, an infomediary company involved in identity management; identity commerce; consumer privacy; and helping consumers own, control, and get value from their personal information. Lumeria's identity management business was designed to provide a secure way for individuals to protect and share their personal information, with Lumeria acting as an agent on their behalf to protect their information and extract value from that information, which was stored in Lumeria's SuperProfile distributed secure XML database. Lumeria had a controversial subsidiary, Lumeria Ad Network, that replaced ads in a user's browser with ads from that person's own ad network.\n\nIn 2005 Davis founded and served as the CEO of PrivaTel, a wholly owned subsidiary of Network Enhanced Telecom, LLP (also known as Network IP), based in Dallas, Texas. While at PrivaTel, Davis developed three main services: My Private Line, a prepaid calling card with disposable phone numbers that could be used for privacy protection when people are not comfortable providing their actual phone number and providing the ability to turn individual numbers off or direct them to go directly to voicemail; Click-and-Connect, a service that enables someone to initiate a phone call from almost every Web page or application; and CallsAd, a service in which classified ads are sold with a temporary contact number, enabling the seller to keep personal numbers private and turn the contact number off after the sale. After Davis's departure, the company was renamed Jaduka and it dropped the privacy products to focus exclusively on the Click-and-Connect service.\n\nIn 2009 Davis founded Grabbit, with Lisa Padilla and Peter Karnig. Grabbit is an open source social media platform that integrates social network and other content streams into a single stream that can be filtered by social networks, content sources, keywords, users, and so on. Users can add many types of real-time streams, updates, and alerts such as RSS feeds, e-mail alerts, news alerts, blog alerts, alarms and reminders, shopping alerts, and more across a broad range of social networks, information, media, and commerce. Grabbit also gives users a powerful set of tools for managing and discovering friends, contacts, and groups of contacts across a wide variety of social and business networks. Grabbit was built with Drupal, and the open source project and source code is published on Github. In partnership with Cognition, Grabbit developed new semantic technology to analyze social media, blog posts, friends, locations, media consumption, product purchases, brand preferences, and other data. As a result of this work, Davis filed a patent application titled \"Semantically Generating Personalized Recommendations Based on Social Feeds to a User in Real-Time and Display Methods Thereof.\"\n\nFrom 1996 to mid-1997, Davis served as director of Strategic Development for CMP Media, during the period leading up to its successful IPO, in August 1997. While working for CMP Media's CEO, Ken Cron, on long-range business strategies, Davis also wrote articles and columns in various CMP publications, including \"Windows Magazine\", \"Home PC\", and \"Computer Reseller News\".\n\nDavis was a columnist for the \"San Jose Mercury News\" and was the US columnist for \"EYE-COM\", one of Japan's leading computer magazines. Davis was also a regular technology commentator for National Public Radio's \"All Things Considered\" and is the former cohost of the radio call-in show \"On Computers\", with John Dvorak, Gina Smith, and Leo LaPorte. Davis also served as president of the Computer Institute, a nonprofit scientific and cultural foundation involved in education research and the study of human/computer ecology. Davis was also the founder of the Festival of Computer and Multimedia Arts (CoMA) in San Francisco.\n\nDavis is the author of more than a dozen computer books, including \"The Complete IBM Personal Computer\"—the first hardware expansion guide to the IBM PC, published in the early 1980s. His 1985 book, \"Desktop Publishing\" (with coauthors John Barry and Michael Wiesenberg), helped popularize the term and received an award from the Computer Press Association. The \"New York Times\" hailed Davis's \"Windows 3.1 Bible\" as \"the best\" book on the topic. Davis also developed the \"Windows Bible\" CD-ROM, released in early 1994. The \"Windows 95 Bible\" was released in April 1996, and his \"Windows 98 Bible\" (with coauthor Kip Crosby) was published in April 1998.\n\nDavis has been named one of the most influential people in the tech industry by several publications in both the US and Japan and is listed in Marquis Who's Who in America. Davis has been widely quoted in publications such as \"Business Week\", the \"Wall Street Journal\", the \"New York Times\", \"USA Today\", \"U.S. News & World Report\", and \"Atlantic Monthly\" and has appeared on many radio and television programs, including NPR's \"All Things Considered\", \"CBS Evening News\", and \"ABC News Tonight\".\n\nMost recently, Davis has been exploring IPTV and Google Glass.\n\n"}

On the promotional holiday, consumers can shop from both large and small online merchants that offer free shipping with guaranteed delivery by Christmas Eve. \n\nFree Shipping Day was started in 2008 by Luke and Maisie Knowles, founders of Coupon Sherpa and FreeShipping.org, in an effort to extend the online shopping season. Statistics at the time showed online shopping peaked on Cyber Monday, generally held the week immediately following Black Friday. Consumers believed they would not receive their online orders in time for Christmas after that date.\n\nThe first event was created in two weeks by Knowles. Several hundred merchants participated and media attention was unusually high. In 2009, more than 750 retailers participated, with 350,000 plus sales taking place through the official site www.FreeShippingDay.com. Merchant participation has more than doubled each subsequent year. Knowles talked with \"TIME\" magazine blogger Brad Tuttle in 2010 about the role of free shipping as a promotional tool, saying, \"I see a trend of free shipping offers around the holidays having a lower threshold than they have in years past...we are seeing more merchants offering free shipping on ALL orders\" \n\nFree Shipping Day was featured on NBC's \"Today\" Show, \"Fox Business\", CNN and CBS's \"Early Show\", as well as in the \"New York Times\", \"Real Simple\", \"Better Homes and Gardens\", \"O\" Magazine and more than 70 other media outlets.\n\nIn 2010, the third Free Shipping Day began at 12 a.m. EST on Friday, Dec. 17, and ended at 12 a.m. EST, Dec. 18. More than 1,700 merchants from all 50 states participated and the official site saw 317,000 unique visitors. Online shoppers spent $942 million to make Free Shipping Day the third highest spending day of the 2010 holiday season, ultimately boosting online sales 61 percent from 2009. In 2011, Free Shipping Day became a billion-dollar shopping holiday with $1.072 billion in sales, followed by $1.01 billion during Free Shipping Day 2012.\n\nIn 2013, Knowles changed the format of Free Shipping Day to only include merchants that could waive all minimum order requirements and guarantee delivery by Christmas Eve. Sales during the event on December 18, 2013, were $868 million, jumping to $926 million the following year.\n\nA Dutch pair of entrepreneurs adapted the concept in 2010 and created GratisBezorging.nl.\n\nThe event creators have also branched out into Canada and the United Kingdom.\n\n"}

However, other routes to 2d materials exist:\nThe early approaches of cleaving multi-layer graphite into single layers or growing it epitaxially by depositing a layer of carbon onto another material have been supplemented by numerous alternatives. In all cases, the graphite must bond to some substrate to retain its 2d shape.\n\nAs of 2014 exfoliation produced graphene with the lowest number of defects and highest electron mobility.\n\nAndre Geim and Konstantin Novoselov initially used adhesive tape to split graphite into graphene. Achieving single layers typically requires multiple exfoliation steps, each producing a slice with fewer layers, until only one remains. After exfoliation the flakes are deposited on a silicon wafer. Crystallites larger than 1 mm and visible to the naked eye can be obtained.\n\nIn this method, a sharp single-crystal diamond wedge penetrates onto the graphite source to exfoliate layers. This method uses highly ordered pyrolytic graphite (HOPG) as the starting material. The experiments were supported by molecular dynamic simulations.\n\nP. Boehm reported producing monolayer flakes of reduced graphene oxide in 1962. Rapid heating of graphite oxide and exfoliation yields highly dispersed carbon powder with a few percent of graphene flakes. Reduction of graphite oxide monolayer films, e.g. by hydrazine with annealing in argon/hydrogen also yielded graphene films. Later the oxidation protocol was enhanced to yield graphene oxide with an almost intact carbon framework that allows efficient removal of functional groups, neither of which was originally possible. The measured charge carrier mobility exceeded /Vs. Spectroscopic analysis of reduced graphene oxide has been conducted.\n\nIn 2014 defect-free, unoxidized graphene-containing liquids were made from graphite using mixers that produce local shear rates greater than . The method was claimed to be applicable to other 2D materials, including boron nitride, Molybdenum disulfide and other layered crystals.\n\nDispersing graphite in a proper liquid medium can produce graphene by sonication. Graphene is separated from graphite by centrifugation, producing graphene concentrations initially up to in N-methylpyrrolidone (NMP) and later to in NMP. Using a suitable ionic liquid as the dispersing liquid medium produced concentrations of . Graphene concentration produced by this method is very low, because nothing prevents the sheets from restacking due to van der Waals forces. The maximum concentrations achieved are the points at which the van der Waals forces overcome the interactive forces between the graphene sheets and the solvent molecules.\n\nAdding a surfactant to a solvent prior to sonication prevents restacking by adsorbing to the graphene's surface. This produces a higher graphene concentration, but removing the surfactant requires chemical treatments.\n\nSonicating graphite at the interface of two immiscible liquids, most notably heptane and water, produced macro-scale graphene films. The graphene sheets are adsorbed to the high energy interface between the heptane and the water, where they are kept from restacking. The graphene remained at the interface even when exposed to force in excess of 300,000 g. The solvents may then be evaporated. The sheets are up to ~95% transparent and conductive.\n\nGraphite particles can be corroded in molten salts to form a variety of carbon nanostructures including graphene. Hydrogen cations, dissolved in molten Lithium chloride, can be discharged on cathodically polarized graphite rods, which then intercalate into the graphite structure, peeling graphite to produce graphene. The graphene nanosheets produced displayed a single-crystalline structure with a lateral size of several hundred nanometers and a high degree of crystallinity and thermal stability.\n\nElectrochemical synthesis can exfoliate graphene. Varying a pulsed voltage controls thickness, flake area, number of defects and affects its properties. The process begins by bathing the graphite in a solvent for intercalation. The process can be tracked by monitoring the solution’s transparency with an LED and photodiode.\n\nGraphene has been prepared by using a sugar (e.g. glucose, fructose, etc.) This substrate-free \"bottom-up\" synthesis is safer, simpler and more environmentally friendly than exfoliation. The method can control thickness, ranging from monolayer to multilayers.\n\nEpitaxy refers to the deposition of a crystalline overlayer on a crystalline substrate, where there is registry between the two. In some cases epitaxial graphene layers are coupled to surfaces weakly enough (by Van der Waals forces) to retain the two dimensional electronic band structure of isolated graphene. An example of this weak coupling is epitaxial graphene on SiC and on Pt(111). On the other hand, the epitaxial graphene layer on some metals can be strongly bonded to the surface with covalent bonds. The properties of the covalently bonded graphene can differ from the ones of free-standing graphene. An example of this strong coupling is epitaxial graphene on Ru(0001). However, the coupling is strong only for the first graphene layer on Ru(0001): the second layer is more weakly coupled to the first layer and has already properties very close to the free standing graphene.\n\nChemical vapor deposition (CVD) is a common form of epitaxy. The process of deposition of solid material onto a heated substrate through decomposition or chemical reaction of compounds contained in the gas passing over the substrate is called chemical vapor deposition. The reactants, generally in the gaseous or vapor phase, react on or near the surface of the substrates, which are at some elevated temperature. The subsequent reaction results in the deposition of atoms or molecules on the entire substrate surface. CVD processes are also widely used for growing epitaxial layers such as a silicon epitaxial layer on a single-crystal silicon substrate (homoepitaxy or commonly referred to as epitaxy) or epitaxial layer deposition on a sapphire (Heteroepitaxy). A special method in CVD, called Epitaxy or Epitaxial Layer Deposition or Vapor-Phase Epitaxy (VPE), has only a single-crystal form as the deposited layer. This process is usually carried out for certain combinations of substrate and layer materials and under special deposition conditions.\n\nEpitaxial graphene films can be grown on various crystalline surfaces. The atomic lattice of the substrate facilitate in orientationally registering the carbon atoms of the graphene layer. The chemical interaction of the graphene with the substrate can vary from weak to strong. This also modifies the properties of the graphene layer. The need for epitaxial graphene arises from the challenges of incorporating carbon nanotubes in large-scale integrated electronic architectures. Research on 2D graphene was thus initiated by experiments on epitaxially grown graphene on single crystal silicon carbide. While significant control has been in growing and characterizing epitaxial graphene, challenges remain in being able to fully exploit the potential of these structures. The promise lies in the hope that charge carriers on these graphene structures, like carbon nanotubes, remain ballistic. If so, it could revolutionize the world of electronics.\n\nHeating silicon carbide (SiC) to high temperatures (>) under low pressures (~10 torr) reduces it to graphene. This process produces epitaxial graphene with dimensions dependent upon the size of the wafer. The face of the SiC used for graphene formation, silicon- or carbon-terminated, highly influences the thickness, mobility and carrier density.\n\nGraphene's electronic band-structure (so-called Dirac cone structure) was first visualized in this material. Weak anti-localization is observed in this material, but not in exfoliated graphene produced by the drawing method. Large, temperature-independent mobilities approach those in exfoliated graphene placed on silicon oxide, but lower than mobilities in suspended graphene produced by the drawing method. Even without transfer, graphene on SiC exhibits massless Dirac fermions. The graphene–substrate interaction can be further passivated.\n\nThe weak van der Waals force that coheres multilayer stacks does not always affect the individual layers' electronic properties. That is, while the electronic properties of certain multilayered epitaxial graphenes are identical to that of a single layer, other properties are affected, as they are in bulk graphite. This effect is well understood theoretically and is related to the symmetry of the interlayer interactions.\n\nEpitaxial graphene on SiC can be patterned using standard microelectronics methods. A band gap can be created and tuned by laser irradiation.\n\nA normal silicon wafer coated with a layer of germanium (Ge) dipped in dilute hydrofluoric acid strips the naturally forming germanium oxide groups, creating hydrogen-terminated germanium. Chemical vapor deposition deposits a layer of graphene on top. The graphene can be peeled from the wafer using a dry process and is then ready for use. The wafer can be reused. The graphene is wrinkle-free, high quality and low in defects.\n\nMetal single crystals are often used as substrates in graphene growth since they form a smooth and chemically uniform growth platform for graphene. Especially, the chemical uniformity is an important advantage of metal single crystal surfaces: for example in different oxide surfaces the oxidized component and the oxygen forms very different adsorption sites. A typical metal single crystal substrate surface is hexagonal close-packed surface since this geometry is also the geometry of carbon atoms in a graphene layer. Common surfaces that have hexagonal close packed geometry are for example FCC(111) and HCP(0001) surfaces. Of course, the similar surface geometries alone do not ensure perfect graphene adsorption on the surface since the distances between surface metal atoms and carbon atoms can be different, resulting in moiré patterns. Common metal surfaces for graphene growth are Pt(111), Ir(111), Ni(111), Ru(0001), Co(0001) and Cu(111) but also at least Fe(110), Au(111), Pd(111), Re(101͊0) and Rh(111) have been used.\n\nThere are several methods how good quality metal single crystal substrates can be manufactured. Czochralski and Bridgman–Stockbarger methods are common industrial methods for bulk metal crystal manufacturing. In these methods, the metal is first melted, after which the metal is let to crystallize around a seed crystal. After crystallization, the crystal is cut into wafers. Other commonly used method especially in research is epitaxy, which enables the growth of numerous different metal single crystal surfaces on some commonly available single crystals like monocrystalline silicon. The advantage of epitaxy over the industrial methods is its low material consumption: with epitaxy substrates with thickness in nanometer scale can be manufactured in comparison to complete self-supporting wafers. This is especially important with rare and expensive metals like rhenium and gold.\n\nGraphene can be grown on ruthenium(0001) surface with CVD, temperature programmed growth (TPG) or segregation. In CVD, a hot ruthenium surface is exposed for some carbon containing molecule like methane or ethene. This results in graphene formation. It has been observed that the graphene can grow only “downhill” of the ruthenium surface steps, not uphill. \nGraphene bonds strongly with covalent bonds to the surface and has only 1.45 Å separation to the surface. This affects the electronic structure of the graphene layer, and the layer behaves differently than a free-standing graphene layer. However, the CVD graphene growth on ruthenium is not totally self-terminating and multilayer graphene formation is possible. The second and higher layers cannot bond to the existing graphene layers as strongly as the first layer bonds to the metal surface, which results in higher 3 Å separation between the graphene layers. The second layer thus has much weaker interaction with the substrate and has very similar electronic properties as free-standing graphene.\nDue to the strong bonding of graphene on the ruthenium surface, only R0 orientation is observed for graphene layer. Although, different studies have shown different lengths for the moiré repeat distance, varying around Graphene(11 x 11) and Ru(10 x 10).<ref name=\"Growth Mechanism of Graphene on Ru(0001) and O_2 Adsorption on the Graphene/Ru(0001) Surface\"></ref> The moiré pattern also causes strong corrugation for the graphene layer, peak height being as much as 1.5 Å.\n\nGraphene is commonly deposited on iridium(111) by CVD but also with temperature programmed growth (TPG) is possible. In CVD, a hot iridium surface is exposed to ethylene. Ethylene decomposes on the surface due to pyrolysis, and the formed carbon adsorbs to the surface forming a graphene monolayer. Thus, only a monolayer growth is possible. The formed graphene layer is weakly bounded to the iridium substrate and is located about 3.3 Å above the surface. The graphene layer and the Ir(111) substrate also forms a moiré pattern with period around 25 Å, depending on the orientation of the graphene on Ir(111). There are many different possibilities for the graphene layer orientation, the most common ones being R0 and R30. The graphene layer has also corrugation due to the moiré pattern, with height varying from 0.04 Å to 0.3 Å. Due to the long-range order of these ripples, minigaps in the electronic band-structure (Dirac cone) become visible.\n\nGraphene sheets have been reported to be grown by dosing ethylene onto the clean, single platinum(111) substrate at temperatures above 1000 °C in ultra-high vacuum (UHV). Graphene monolayer interacts weakly with the Pt(111) surface below it confirmed by the local density of states which is a ‘V’ shape. Kim et al., reported the electronic properties of the graphene nanoislands whose geometry is affected by varying the annealing temperatures and providing a fundamental understanding on graphene growth. The effect of annealing on the average size and density of graphene islands grown on Pt(111) has been widely studied. Sutter et al., reported a thermal-stress driven wrinkle propagation on the graphene sheet as observed from low-energy electron microscopy during cooling after growth. The onset of lattice mismatch precedes the observation of moiré patterns with small (e.g., (3x3)G) and large unit cells (e.g., (8x8)G).\n\nHigh-quality sheets of few-layer graphene exceeding in area have been synthesized via CVD on thin nickel films using multiple techniques. First the film is exposed to argon gas at 900–1000 degrees Celsius. Methane is then mixed into the gas, and the methane's disassociated carbon is absorbed into the film. The solution is then cooled and the carbon diffuses out of the nickel to form graphene films. CVD grown graphene on Ni(111) surface forms (1 x 1) structure, i.e. the lattice constants of Ni and graphene matches and no moiré pattern is formed. There are still different possible adsorption sites for carbon atoms on nickel, at least top, hcp hollow, fcc hollow and bridge sites have been reported [17].\n\nAnother method used temperatures compatible with conventional CMOS processing, using a nickel-based alloy with a gold catalyst. This process dissolves carbon atoms inside a transition metal melt at a certain temperature and then precipitates the dissolved carbon at lower temperatures as single layer graphene (SLG).\n\nThe metal is first melted in contact with a carbon source, possibly a graphite crucible inside which the melt is carried out or graphite powder/chunks that are placed in the melt. Keeping the melt in contact with the carbon at a specific temperature dissolves the carbon atoms, saturating the melt based on the metal–carbon binary phase diagram. Lowering the temperature decreases carbon's solubility and the excess carbon precipitates onto the melt. The floating layer can be either skimmed or frozen for later removal.\n\nUsing different morphology, including thick graphite, few layer graphene (FLG) and SLG were observed on metal substrate. Raman spectroscopy proved that SLG had grown on nickel substrate. The SLG Raman spectrum featured no D and D′ band, indicating its pristine nature. Since nickel is not Raman active, direct Raman spectroscopy of graphene layers on top of the nickel is achievable.\n\nAnother approach covered a sheet of silicon dioxide glass (the substrate) on one side with a nickel film. Graphene deposited via chemical vapor deposition formed into layers on both sides of the film, one on the exposed top side, and one on the underside, sandwiched between nickel and glass. Peeling the nickel and the top layer of graphene left an intervening layer of graphene on the glass. While the top graphene layer could be harvested from the foil as in earlier methods, the bottom layer was already in place on the glass. The quality and purity of the attached layer was not assessed.\n\nGraphene on cobalt(0001) is grown similarly as on a Ni substrate. A Co(0001) film is first grown on a wolfram(110) substrate, following which chemical vapor deposition of propylene at 450 °C enables graphene growth on Co(0001). This results in a p(1x1) structure along with structures that indicated domains of graphene slightly rotated with respect to the Co lattice. Graphene structures grown on Co(0001) are found to be identical to those grown on Ni(111) upon structural and electronic characterization. Co(0001) is ferromagnetic but the graphene monolayer grown over was found to not diminish the spin polarization. Unlike its Ni(111) counterpart, graphene grown on Co(0001) does not show the Rashba effect.\n\nCopper foil, at room temperature and very low pressure and in the presence of small amounts of methane produces high quality graphene. The growth automatically stops after a single layer forms. Arbitrarily large films can be created. The single layer growth is due to the low concentration of carbon in methane. The process is surface-based rather than relying on absorption into the metal and then diffusion of carbon into graphene layers on the surface. The room temperature process eliminates the need for postproduction steps and reduces production from a ten-hour/nine- to ten-step procedure to a single step that takes five minutes. A chemical reaction between the hydrogen plasma formed from the methane and ordinary air molecules in the chamber generates cyano radicals—carbon–nitrogen molecules without electrons. These charged molecules scour away surface imperfections, providing a pristine substrate. The graphene deposits form lines that merge into each other, forming a seamless sheet that contributes to mechanical and electrical integrity.\n\nLarger hydrocarbons such as ethane and propane produce bilayer coatings. Atmospheric pressure CVD growth produces multilayer graphene on copper (similar to nickel).\n\nThe material has fewer defects, which in higher temperature processes result from thermal expansion/contraction. Ballistic transport was observed in the resulting material.\n\nTin has been recently used for synthesis of graphene at 250°C. Low-temperature as well as the transfer free graphene growth on substrates is the major concern of graphene research for its practical applications. The transfer free graphene growth on SiO2 covered Si (SiO2/Si) substrate at 250 °C based on a solid-liquid-solid reaction has been achieved by tin.\n\nGram-quantities were produced by the reduction of ethanol by sodium metal, followed by pyrolysis of the ethoxide product and washing with water to remove sodium salts.\n\nLarge scale roll-to-roll production of graphene based on chemical vapor deposition, was first demonstrated in 2010. In 2014 a two-step roll-to-roll manufacturing process was announced. The first roll-to-roll step produces the graphene via chemical vapor deposition, and the second step binds the graphene to a substrate. In 2018, researchers at MIT refined the roll-to-roll process, creating a promising way to produce large amounts of graphene.\n\nGrowing graphene in an industrial resistive-heating cold wall CVD system was claimed to produce graphene 100 times faster than conventional CVD systems, cuts costs by 99 percent and produce material with enhanced electronic qualities.\n\nCold wall CVD technique can be used to study the underlying surface science involved in graphene nucleation and growth as it allows unprecedented control of process parameters like gas flow rates, temperature and pressure as demonstrated in a recent study. The study was carried out in a home-built vertical cold wall system utilizing resistive heating by passing direct current through the substrate. It provided conclusive insight into a typical surface-mediated nucleation and growth mechanism involved in two-dimensional materials grown using catalytic CVD under conditions sought out in the semiconductor industry.\n\nGraphene can be created by cutting open carbon nanotubes. In one such method multi-walled carbon nanotubes are cut open in solution by action of potassium permanganate and sulfuric acid. In another method graphene nanoribbons were produced by plasma etching of nanotubes partly embedded in a polymer film.\n\nIn applications where the thickness and packing density of graphene layer needs to carefully controlled, the Langmuir-Blodgett method has been used. In addition to forming directly a layer of graphene, another approach that has been widely studied is forming a graphene oxide layer which can then be reduced further into graphene.\n\nSome of the benefits of LB deposition include an accurate control over the layered architecture of the graphene, the layer-by-layer deposition process is amenable to assembling any combination of thin carbon layers on a substrates, the assembly process operates at room temperature and produces high throughputs while it is amenable to automation and mass production.\n\nA highly exothermic reaction combusts magnesium in an oxidation–reduction reaction with carbon dioxide, producing a variety of carbon nanoparticles including graphene and fullerenes. The carbon dioxide reactant may be either solid (dry-ice) or gaseous. The products of this reaction are carbon and magnesium oxide. was issued for this process.\n\nIn 2014, carbon nanotube-reinforced graphene was made via spin coating and annealing functionalized carbon nanotubes. The resulting material was stronger, flexible and more conductive than conventional graphene.\n\nSupersonic acceleration of droplets through a Laval nozzle was used to deposit small droplets of reduced graphene-oxide in suspension on a substrate. The droplets disperse evenly, evaporate rapidly and display reduced flake aggregations. In addition, the topological defects (Stone-Wales defect and vacancies) originally in the flakes disappeared. The result was a higher quality graphene layer. The energy of the impact stretches the graphene and rearranges its carbon atoms into flawless hexagonal graphene with no need for post-treatment. The high amount of energy also allows the graphene droplets to heal any defects in the graphene layer that occur during this process.\n\nAnother approach sprays buckyballs at supersonic speeds onto a substrate. The balls cracked open upon impact, and the resulting unzipped cages then bond together to form a graphene film. The buckyballs are released into a helium or hydrogen gas, which expands at supersonic speeds, carrying the carbon balls with it. The buckyballs achieve energies of around 40 keV without changing their internal dynamics. This material contains hexagons and pentagons that come from the original structures. The pentagons could introduce a band gap.\n\nProducing graphene via intercalation splits graphite into single layer graphene by inserting guest molecules/ions between the graphite layers. Graphite was first intercalated in 1841 using a strong oxidizing or reducing agent that damaged the material's desirable properties. Kovtyukhova developed a widely used oxidative intercalation method in 1999. In 2014, she was able to achieve intercalation using non-oxidizing Brønsted acids (phosphoric, sulfuric, dichloroacetic and alkylsulfonic acids), but without oxidizing agents. The new method has yet to achieve output sufficient for commercialization.\n\nIn 2014 a laser-based single-step, scalable approach to graphene production was announced. The technique produced and patterned porous three-dimensional graphene film networks from commercial polymer films. The system used a CO2 infrared laser. The sp-carbon atoms were photothermally converted to sp-carbon atoms by pulsed laser irradiation. The result exhibits high electrical conductivity. The material can produce interdigitated electrodes for in-plane microsupercapacitors with specific capacitances of >4 mF cm and power densities of ~9 mW cm. Laser-induced production appeared to allow roll-to-roll manufacturing processes and provides a route to electronic and energy storage devices.\n\nApplying a layer of graphite oxide film to a DVD and burning it in a DVD writer produced a thin graphene film with high electrical conductivity (1738 siemens per meter) and specific surface area (1520 square meters per gram) that was highly resistant and malleable.\n\nIn 2012, a microwave-assisted, scalable approach was reported to directly synthesize graphene with different size from graphite in one step. The resulting graphene does not need any post reduction treatment as it contains very little oxygen. This approach avoids use of potassium permanganate in the reaction mixture. It was also reported that by microwave radiation assistance, graphene oxide with or without holes can be synthesized by controlling microwave time. This method uses a recipe similar to Hummer's method, but uses microwave heating instead of traditional heating. Microwave heating can dramatically shorten the reaction time from days to seconds.\n\nAccelerating carbon ions under an electrical field into a semiconductor made of thin Ni films on a substrate of SiO2/Si, creates a wafer-scale () wrinkle/tear/residue-free graphene layer that changes the semiconductor's physical, chemical and electrical properties. The process uses 20 keV and a dose of 1 × 10 cm at a relatively low temperature of 500 °C. This was followed by high-temperature activation annealing (600–900 °C) to form an sp-bonded structure.\n\nResearchers heated soybean oil in a furnace for ≈30 minutes. The heat decomposed the oil into elemental carbon that deposited on nickel foil as single/few-layer graphene.\n\nGraphene oxide can be converted to graphene using the bacteria Shewanella oneidensis\n\nLow-energy electron microscopy (LEEM) and photoemission electron microscopy (PEEM) are techniques suited to performing dynamic observations of surfaces with nanometer resolution in a vacuum. With LEEM, it is possible to carry out low-energy electron diffraction (LEED) and micro-LEED experiments. LEED is the standard method for studying the surface structure of a crystalline material. Low-energy electrons (20–200 eV) impact the surface and elastically backscattered electrons illuminate a diffraction pattern on a fluorescent screen. The LEED method is a surface-sensitive technique as electrons have low energy and are not able to penetrate deep into the sample. For example, a micro-sized LEED revealed the presence of rotational variations of graphene on SiC substrate.\n\nRaman spectroscopy can provide information about the number of layers on graphene stacks, the atomic structure of graphene edges, disorder and defects, the stacking order between different layers, the effect of strain, and charge transfer. Graphene has three main features in its Raman spectrum, called the D, G, and 2D (also called G’) modes that appear at about 1350, 1583 and 2700 cm-1.\n\nIn scanning tunneling microscopy (STM), a sharp tip scans the surface of a sample in a regime of such tip-sample distances that electrons can quantum tunneling from the tip to the sample surface or vice versa. STM can be performed in a constant current or a constant height mode. The low temperature STM measurements provide thermal stability, which is a requirement for high resolution imaging and spectroscopic analysis. The first atomically resolved images of graphene grown on a platinum substrate were obtained using STM in the 1990s.\n\nAtomic force microscopy (AFM) is mostly used to measure the force between atoms located at the sharp point of the tip (located on the cantilever) and atoms at the sample surface. The bending of the cantilever as a result of the interaction between the tip and the sample is detected and converted to an electrical signal. The electrostatic force microscopy mode of AFM has been used to detect the surface potential of graphene layers as a function of thickness variation allowing for quantification of potential difference maps showing distinction between graphene layers of different thicknesses.\n\nTransmission electron microscopy (TEM) uses electrons to generate high-resolution images as using electrons allows to overcome limitations of visible light wavelengths. TEM on graphene should be done with electron energy less than 80 keV to induce a smaller amount of defects, because this energy is the threshold electron energy for damaging a single-wall carbon nano-tube. There are some other difficulties in the study of graphene by TEM, e.g., in a plane-view geometry (top-view graphene) the substrate causes strong electron scattering, and a thick substrate makes it impossible to detect the graphene layer. For a cross-section view, detecting a monolayer graphene is a difficult task as it needs simulation of the TEM images.\n\nIn scanning electron microscopy (SEM), a high-energy electron beam (ranging a few 100 eVs to a few keVs) is used to generate a variety of signals at the surface of a sample. These signals which come from the electron-sample interactions expose information about the sample, including surface morphology, crystalline structure, and chemical composition. SEM is also used for characterizations of the growth of graphene on SiC. Because of its atomic thickness, graphene is usually detected with secondary electrons that probe only a sample surface. With SEM imaging, different contrast can be observed, such as thickness, roughness, and edge contrast; the brighter area shows the thinner part of the graphene layers. The roughness contrast of a graphene layer is due to the different numbers of secondary electrons detected. The defects such as wrinkles, ruptures, and folds can be studied by different contrast in SEM images.\n\n"}

Usually a heartbeat is sent between machines at a regular interval in the order of seconds. If the endpoint does not receive a heartbeat for a time—usually a few heartbeat intervals—the machine that should have sent the heartbeat is assumed to have failed.\n\nA heartbeat protocol is generally used to negotiate and monitor the availability of a resource, such as a floating IP address. Typically when a heartbeat starts on a machine, it will perform an election process with other machines on the heartbeat network to determine which machine, if any, owns the resource. On heartbeat networks of more than two machines, it is important to take into account partitioning, where two halves of the network could be functioning but not able to communicate with each other. In a situation such as this, it is important that the resource is only owned by one machine, not one machine in each partition.\n\nAs a heartbeat is intended to be used to indicate the health of a machine, it is important that the heartbeat protocol and the transport that it runs on is as reliable as possible. Causing a failover because of a false alarm may, depending on the resource, be highly undesirable. It is also important to react quickly to an actual failure, so again it is important that the heartbeat is reliable. For this reason it is often desirable to have heartbeat running over more than one transport; for instance, an Ethernet segment using UDP/IP, and a serial link.\n\n"}
{"id": "4671465", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=4671465", "title": "High-explosive incendiary", "text": "High-explosive incendiary\n\nIn warfare, High-explosive incendiary (HEI) is a type of ammunition specially designed to impart energy and therefore damage to its target in one or both of two ways: via a high-explosive charge and/or via its incendiary (fire-causing) effects. Each round has both capabilities.\n\nHEI ammunition is fused either mechanically or chemically. The armor-piercing ability can vary widely, allowing for more focused fragmentation or larger scatter.\n\nHEI ammunition was originally developed for use in large-caliber cannon, howitzer and naval artillery. Currently, HEI rounds are most commonly made in medium-caliber sizes of 20 mm, 25 mm, and 30 mm. They are fired from various platforms, including aircraft, anti-aircraft cannons, and anti-missile systems, as well as common battlefield howitzers, though the latter has gone through a recent decline in use.\n\nHEI ammunition has also been used on the battlefield against tanks and other armoured vehicles, but this has become impractical due to the invention of modern armour systems such as Chobham and explosive reactive armour, which can absorb most high-explosive rounds currently used. \n\nRecently, APIS (armour piercing incendiary shells) have been used; these penetrate the target using the kinetic properties of the round before the incendiary round goes off, smothering the crew in flames, cooking off ammunition and igniting combustible materials, generally destroying the target.\n\nThe shells were first employed in naval batteries, but soon found their way to land-based howitzers as well. They caused fires, which on ships can be difficult to extinguish in the tight spaces. Also, fired at tanks and soft targets, they can cause fires that completely engulf the vehicle, killing anyone inside.\n\nOccasionally HEIs were used against tanks (heavily armored) and also lightly armoured vehicles, but, since the invention of modern battle armour, such as Chobham, and Explosive Reactive Armour, these shells have become less and less practical for anti-tank work, and more useful for destroying “soft” targets such as air bases, trenches, or bunkers, in which they can create fires of over 1000 degrees Celsius. Incendiary shells are no longer in use by many countries, due to bans on the use of phosphorus weapons.\n\nArmor-piercing shot and shell penetrate the target using kinetic energy before the incendiary charge ignites, smothering the crew in flames, detonating ammunition, and destroying the target.\n\n\n"}

As of February 24, 2017, Intersil is a subsidiary of Renesas. The original Intersil was formed in August 1999 through the acquisition of the semiconductor business of Harris Corporation. Intersil is a power management IC business, with specialized capability in power management and precision analog technology for applications in industrial, infrastructure, mobile, automotive and aerospace.\n\nThe original Intersil, Inc. was founded in 1967 by the Swiss physicist Jean Hoerni to develop digital watch Integrated Circuits (ICs). The European subsidiary Eurosil was originally partially funded by SSIH, a Swiss watch company. Later-on, Intersil had a development contract with the Japanese company Daini Seikosha and became supplier of low-voltage CMOS watch ICs for Seiko. When microprocessors emerged to the market in the 1970s, Intersil participated with its 12-bit IM6100, which was the first microprocessor produced in CMOS technology and emulated the PDP-8 instruction set. In 1988 Intersil was taken over by Harris Semiconductor, which had offered the IM6100 as second source. Harris combined these activities with the semiconductor divisions of Radiation Incorporated, General Electric and RCA they had taken over before.\n\nIn 1999 Harris spun off its entire semiconductor division and Intersil Corporation was created with the largest IPO in American semiconductor industry history. The second Intersil Corporation is a different company from the original Intersil, Inc.\n\nNext to digital circuits like microprocessors and memories like the 1k-bit CMOS RAM IM6508 and CMOS EPROMS IM6604/IM6654 Intersil designed famous analogue ICs like the ICM8038 waveform generator. A creation of Intersil (as Harris Semiconductor) is the PRISM line of Wi-Fi hardware: that group of products was sold to GlobespanVirata in 2003, and maintained by Conexant. Intersil is the manufacturer of the RCA (CDP)1802 microprocessor (also known as RCA COSMAC), a CPU traditionally used in space applications.\n\nIn the 2000s, Intersil established market leadership in Vcore power management for PCs, switching and buck boost regulators for industrial and consumer power systems, and radiation hardened analog and power ICs for military and commercial applications.\n\nThe company, under CEO Dave Bell, then began the expansion of a catalog analog business. The company also completed a series of acquisitions, two of which are still part of the portfolio, Zilker Labs digital power devices and Techwell automotive and security and surveillance products.\n\nIn 2012, with revenue in decline, the company's board of directors removed Dave Bell and began a search for a new CEO. In March 2013, the board appointed Necip Sayiner, the architect of Silicon Labs' turnaround, as CEO. Sayiner concentrated the company's efforts on power management and select target markets. The company was able to return to profitability in 2013 and in early 2014 re-launched as a power management company, with products to improve power efficiency, extend battery life and reduce size.\n\nJapanese semiconductor company Renesas acquired Intersil on February 24, 2017.\n\nIntersil develops and markets power management and analog technology for applications in the industrial, infrastructure, mobile, automotive and aerospace markets.\n\nThe company supplies power integrated circuits including battery management, computing power, display power, regulators and controllers and power modules; as well as analog components such as amplifiers and buffers, proximity and light sensors, data converters, timing products, optoelectronics and interface products.\n\n"}

{"id": "14661057", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=14661057", "title": "Nanomechanics", "text": "Nanomechanics\n\nNanomechanics is a branch of \"nanoscience\" studying fundamental \"mechanical\" (elastic, thermal and kinetic) properties of physical systems at the nanometer scale. Nanomechanics has emerged on the crossroads of classical mechanics, solid-state physics, statistical mechanics, materials science, and quantum chemistry. As an area of nanoscience, nanomechanics provides a scientific foundation of nanotechnology. \n\nNanomechanics is that branch of nanoscience which deals with the study and application of fundamental mechanical properties of physical systems at the nanoscale, such as elastic, thermal and kinetic material properties.\n\nOften, nanomechanics is viewed as a \"branch\" of nanotechnology, i.e., an applied area with a focus on the mechanical properties of \"engineered\" nanostructures and nanosystems (systems with nanoscale components of importance). Examples of the latter include nanoparticles, nanopowders, nanowires, nanorods, nanoribbons, nanotubes, including carbon nanotubes (CNT) and boron nitride nanotubes (BNNTs); nanoshells, nanomebranes, nanocoatings, nanocomposite/nanostructured materials, (fluids with dispersed nanoparticles); nanomotors, etc.\n\nSome of the well-established \"fields of nanomechanics\" are: nanomaterials, nanotribology (friction, wear and contact mechanics at the nanoscale), nanoelectromechanical systems (NEMS), and nanofluidics. \n\nAs a fundamental science, nanomechanics is based on some empirical principles (basic observations), namely general mechanics principles and specific principles arising from the smallness of physical sizes of the object of study.\n\nGeneral mechanics principles include:\n\n\nDue to smallness of the studied object, nanomechanics also accounts for:\n\n\nThese principles serve to provide a basic insight into novel mechanical properties of nanometer objects. Novelty is understood in the sense that these properties are not present in similar macroscale objects or much different from the properties of those (e.g., nanorods vs. usual macroscopic beam structures). In particular, smallness of the subject itself gives rise to various surface effects determined by higher surface-to-volume ratio of nanostructures, and thus affects mechanoenergetic and thermal properties (melting point, heat capacitance, etc.) of nanostructures. Discreteness serves a fundamental reason, for instance, for the dispersion of mechanical waves in solids, and some special behavior of basic elastomechanics solutions at small scales. Plurality of degrees of freedom and the rise of thermal fluctuations are the reasons for thermal tunneling of nanoparticles through potential barriers, as well as for the cross-diffusion of liquids and solids. Smallness and thermal fluctuations provide the basic reasons of the Brownian motion of nanoparticles. Increased importance of thermal fluctuations and configuration entropy at the nanoscale give rise to superelasticity, entropic elasticity (entropic forces), and other exotic types of elasticity of nanostructures. Aspects of configuration entropy are also of great interest in the context self-organization and cooperative behavior of open nanosystems. \n\nQuantum effects determine \"forces of interaction\" between individual atoms in physical objects, which are introduced in nanomechanics by means of some averaged mathematical models called \"interatomic potentials\". \n\nSubsequent utilization of the interatomic potentials within the classical multibody dynamics provide deterministic mechanical models of nano structures and systems at the atomic scale/resolution. Numerical methods of solution of these models are called \"molecular dynamics\" (MD), and sometimes \"molecular mechanics\" (especially, in relation to statically equilibrated (still) models). Non-deterministic numerical approaches include Monte Carlo, Kinetic More-Carlo (KMC), and other methods. Contemporary numerical tools include also hybrid \"multiscale approaches\" allowing concurrent or sequential utilization of the atomistic scale methods (usually, MD) with the continuum (macro) scale methods (usually, field emission microscopy) within a single mathematical model. Development of these complex methods is a separate subject of applied mechanics research. \n\nQuantum effects also determine novel electrical, optical and chemical properties of nanostructures, and therefore they find even greater attention in adjacent areas of nanoscience and nanotechnology, such as nanoelectronics, advanced energy systems, and nanobiotechnology.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1006597", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1006597", "title": "Nanorobotics", "text": "Nanorobotics\n\nNanorobotics is an emerging technology field creating machines or robots whose components are at or near the scale of a nanometre (10 meters). More specifically, nanorobotics (as opposed to microrobotics) refers to the nanotechnology engineering discipline of designing and building nanorobots, with devices ranging in size from 0.1–10 micrometres and constructed of nanoscale or molecular components. The terms \"nanobot\", \"nanoid\", \"nanite\", \"nanomachine\", or \"nanomite\" have also been used to describe such devices currently under research and development.\n\nNanomachines are largely in the research and development phase, but some primitive molecular machines and nanomotors have been tested. An example is a sensor having a switch approximately 1.5 nanometers across, able to count specific molecules in a chemical sample. The first useful applications of nanomachines may be in nanomedicine. For example, biological machines could be used to identify and destroy cancer cells. Another potential application is the detection of toxic chemicals, and the measurement of their concentrations, in the environment. Rice University has demonstrated a single-molecule car developed by a chemical process and including Buckminsterfullerenes (buckyballs) for wheels. It is actuated by controlling the environmental temperature and by positioning a scanning tunneling microscope tip.\n\nAnother definition is a robot that allows precise interactions with nanoscale objects, or can manipulate with nanoscale resolution. Such devices are more related to microscopy or scanning probe microscopy, instead of the description of nanorobots as molecular machine. Using the microscopy definition, even a large apparatus such as an atomic force microscope can be considered a nanorobotic instrument when configured to perform nanomanipulation. For this viewpoint, macroscale robots or microrobots that can move with nanoscale precision can also be considered nanorobots.\n\nAccording to Richard Feynman, it was his former graduate student and collaborator Albert Hibbs who originally suggested to him (circa 1959) the idea of a \"medical\" use for Feynman's theoretical micromachines (see nanomachine). Hibbs suggested that certain repair machines might one day be reduced in size to the point that it would, in theory, be possible to (as Feynman put it) \"swallow the surgeon\". The idea was incorporated into Feynman's 1959 essay \"There's Plenty of Room at the Bottom.\"\n\nSince nanorobots would be microscopic in size, it would probably be necessary for very large numbers of them to work together to perform microscopic and macroscopic tasks. These nanorobot swarms, both those unable to replicate (as in utility fog) and those able to replicate unconstrainedly in the natural environment (as in grey goo and its less common variants, such as synthetic biology or utility fog), are found in many science fiction stories, such as the Borg nanoprobes in \"Star Trek\" and \"The Outer Limits\" episode \"The New Breed\".\n\nSome proponents of nanorobotics, in reaction to the grey goo scenarios that they earlier helped to propagate, hold the view that nanorobots able to replicate outside of a restricted factory environment do not form a necessary part of a purported productive nanotechnology, and that the process of self-replication, were it ever to be developed, could be made inherently safe. They further assert that their current plans for developing and using molecular manufacturing do not in fact include free-foraging replicators.\n\nThe most detailed theoretical discussion of nanorobotics, including specific design issues such as sensing, power communication, navigation, manipulation, locomotion, and onboard computation, has been presented in the medical context of nanomedicine by Robert Freitas. Some of these discussions remain at the level of unbuildable generality and do not approach the level of detailed engineering.\n\nA document with a proposal on nanobiotech development using open design technology methods, as in open-source hardware and open-source software, has been addressed to the United Nations General Assembly. According to the document sent to the United Nations, in the same way that open source has in recent years accelerated the development of computer systems, a similar approach should benefit the society at large and accelerate nanorobotics development. The use of nanobiotechnology should be established as a human heritage for the coming generations, and developed as an open technology based on ethical practices for peaceful purposes. Open technology is stated as a fundamental key for such an aim.\n\nIn the same ways that technology research and development drove the space race and nuclear arms race, a race for nanorobots is occurring. There is plenty of ground allowing nanorobots to be included among the emerging technologies. Some of the reasons are that large corporations, such as General Electric, Hewlett-Packard, Synopsys, Northrop Grumman and Siemens have been recently working in the development and research of nanorobots; surgeons are getting involved and starting to propose ways to apply nanorobots for common medical procedures; universities and research institutes were granted funds by government agencies exceeding $2 billion towards research developing nanodevices for medicine; bankers are also strategically investing with the intent to acquire beforehand rights and royalties on future nanorobots commercialisation. Some aspects of nanorobot litigation and related issues linked to monopoly have already arisen. A large number of patents has been granted recently on nanorobots, done mostly for patent agents, companies specialized solely on building patent portfolios, and lawyers. After a long series of patents and eventually litigations, see for example the Invention of Radio, or the War of Currents, emerging fields of technology tend to become a monopoly, which normally is dominated by large corporations.\n\nManufacturing nanomachines assembled from molecular components is a very challenging task. Because of the level of difficulty, many engineers and scientists continue working cooperatively across multidisciplinary approaches to achieve breakthroughs in this new area of development. Thus, it is quite understandable the importance of the following distinct techniques currently applied towards manufacturing nanorobots:\n\nThe joint use of nanoelectronics, photolithography, and new biomaterials provides a possible approach to manufacturing nanorobots for common medical uses, such as surgical instrumentation, diagnosis, and drug delivery. This method for manufacturing on nanotechnology scale is in use in the electronics industry since 2008. So, practical nanorobots should be integrated as nanoelectronics devices, which will allow tele-operation and advanced capabilities for medical instrumentation.\n\nA \"nucleic acid robot\" (nubot) is an organic molecular machine at the nanoscale. DNA structure can provide means to assemble 2D and 3D nanomechanical devices. DNA based machines can be activated using small molecules, proteins and other molecules of DNA. Biological circuit gates based on DNA materials have been engineered as molecular machines to allow in-vitro drug delivery for targeted health problems. Such material based systems would work most closely to smart biomaterial drug system delivery, while not allowing precise in vivo teleoperation of such engineered prototypes.\n\nSeveral reports have demonstrated the attachment of synthetic molecular motors to surfaces. These primitive nanomachines have been shown to undergo machine-like motions when confined to the surface of a macroscopic material. The surface anchored motors could potentially be used to move and position nanoscale materials on a surface in the manner of a conveyor belt.\n\nNanofactory Collaboration, founded by Robert Freitas and Ralph Merkle in 2000 and involving 23 researchers from 10 organizations and 4 countries, focuses on developing a practical research agenda specifically aimed at developing positionally-controlled diamond mechanosynthesis and a diamondoid nanofactory that would have the capability of building diamondoid medical nanorobots.\n\nThe emerging field of bio-hybrid systems combines biological and synthetic structural elements for biomedical or robotic applications. The constituting elements of bio-nanoelectromechanical systems (BioNEMS) are of nanoscale size, for example DNA, proteins or nanostructured mechanical parts. Thiol-ene ebeam resist allow the direct writing of nanoscale features, followed by the functionalization of the natively reactive resist surface with biomolecules. Other approaches use a biodegradable material attached to magnetic particles that allow them to be guided around the body.\n\nThis approach proposes the use of biological microorganisms, like the bacterium \"Escherichia coli\" and \"Salmonella typhimurium\".\nThus the model uses a flagellum for propulsion purposes. Electromagnetic fields normally control the motion of this kind of biological integrated device.\nChemists at the University of Nebraska have created a humidity gauge by fusing a bacterium to a silicone computer chip.\n\nRetroviruses can be retrained to attach to cells and replace DNA. They go through a process called reverse transcription to deliver genetic packaging in a vector. Usually, these devices are Pol – Gag genes of the virus for the Capsid and Delivery system. This process is called retroviral gene therapy, having the ability to re-engineer cellular DNA by usage of viral vectors. This approach has appeared in the form of retroviral, adenoviral, and lentiviral gene delivery systems. These gene therapy vectors have been used in cats to send genes into the genetically modified organism (GMO), causing it to display the trait.\n3D printing is the process by which a three-dimensional structure is built through the various processes of additive manufacturing. Nanoscale 3D printing involves many of the same process, incorporated at a much smaller scale. To print a structure in the 5-400 µm scale, the precision of the 3D printing machine is improved greatly. A two-steps process of 3D printing, using a 3D printing and laser etched plates method was incorporated as an improvement technique. To be more precise at a nanoscale, the 3D printing process uses a laser etching machine, which etches into each plate the details needed for the segment of nanorobot. The plate is then transferred to the 3D printer, which fills the etched regions with the desired nanoparticle. The 3D printing process is repeated until the nanorobot is built from the bottom up. This 3D printing process has many benefits. First, it increases the overall accuracy of the printing process. Second, it has the potential to create functional segments of a nanorobot. The 3D printer uses a liquid resin, which is hardened at precisely the correct spots by a focused laser beam. The focal point of the laser beam is guided through the resin by movable mirrors and leaves behind a hardened line of solid polymer, just a few hundred nanometers wide. This fine resolution enables the creation of intricately structured sculptures as tiny as a grain of sand. This process takes place by using photoactive resins, which are hardened by the laser at an extremely small scale to create the structure. This process is quick by nanoscale 3D printing standards. Ultra-small features can be made with the 3D micro-fabrication technique used in multiphoton photopolymerisation. This approach uses a focused laser to trace the desired 3D object into a block of gel. Due to the nonlinear nature of photo excitation, the gel is cured to a solid only in the places where the laser was focused while the remaining gel is then washed away. Feature sizes of under 100 nm are easily produced, as well as complex structures with moving and interlocked parts.\n\nPotential uses for nanorobotics in medicine include early diagnosis and targeted drug-delivery for cancer, biomedical instrumentation, surgery, pharmacokinetics, monitoring of diabetes, and health care.\n\nIn such plans, future medical nanotechnology is expected to employ nanorobots injected into the patient to perform work at a cellular level. Such nanorobots intended for use in medicine should be non-replicating, as replication would needlessly increase device complexity, reduce reliability, and interfere with the medical mission.\n\nNanotechnology provides a wide range of new technologies for developing customized means to optimize the delivery of pharmaceutical drugs. Today, harmful side effects of treatments such as chemotherapy are commonly a result of drug delivery methods that don't pinpoint their intended target cells accurately. Researchers at Harvard and MIT, however, have been able to attach special RNA strands, measuring nearly 10 nm in diameter, to nanoparticles, filling them with a chemotherapy drug. These RNA strands are attracted to cancer cells. When the nanoparticle encounters a cancer cell, it adheres to it, and releases the drug into the cancer cell. This directed method of drug delivery has great potential for treating cancer patients while avoiding negative effects (commonly associated with improper drug delivery). The first demonstration of nanomotors operating in living organism was carried out in 2014 at University of California, San Diego. MRI-guided nanocapsules are one potential precursor to nanorobots.\n\nAnother useful application of nanorobots is assisting in the repair of tissue cells alongside white blood cells. Recruiting inflammatory cells or white blood cells (which include neutrophil granulocytes, lymphocytes, monocytes, and mast cells) to the affected area is the first response of tissues to injury. Because of their small size, nanorobots could attach themselves to the surface of recruited white cells, to squeeze their way out through the walls of blood vessels and arrive at the injury site, where they can assist in the tissue repair process. Certain substances could possibly be used to accelerate the recovery.\n\nThe science behind this mechanism is quite complex. Passage of cells across the blood endothelium, a process known as transmigration, is a mechanism involving engagement of cell surface receptors to adhesion molecules, active force exertion and dilation of the vessel walls and physical deformation of the migrating cells. By attaching themselves to migrating inflammatory cells, the robots can in effect “hitch a ride” across the blood vessels, bypassing the need for a complex transmigration mechanism of their own.\n\n, in the United States, Food and Drug Administration (FDA) regulates nanotechnology on the basis of size.\n\nSoutik Betal, during his doctoral research at the University of Texas, San Antonio developed nanocomposite particles that are controlled remotely by an electromagnetic field. This series of nanorobots that are now enlisted in the Guinness World Record, can be used to interact with the biological cells. Scientists suggest that this technology can be used for the treatment of cancer. \n\nThe Nanites are characters on the TV show Mystery Science Theater 3000. They're self-replicating, bio-engineered organisms that work on the ship and reside in the SOL's computer systems. They made their first appearance in season 8.\n\nNanites are used in a number of episodes in the Netflix series \"Travelers\". They are programmed and injected into injured people to perform repairs.\n\n\n"}

The OCSiAl headquarter is located in Luxembourg, with offices in the US, Russia, China, Hong Kong, South Korea and India, with a team of over 350 employees in total.\n\nThe synthesis technology used by OCSiAl for graphene nanotubes (also known as single wall carbon nanotubes – SWCNT) is based on research by one of the company’s founders, Mikhail Predtechensky, OCSiAl’s Chief Technology Officer and a member of the Russian Academy of Sciences. The technology is notable for producing SWCNT in tonnes to enable low enough pricing for industrial applications to become economically feasible.\n\nThe company’s initial synthesis facility, named Graphetron 1.0, was built at the company’s scientific and prototyping center in Akademgorodok, Novosibirsk. In 2014 output was estimated at 1 tonne, with a capacity of 10 tonnes. In 2017 OCSiAl noted plans to reach 60 tonnes of production capacity by commissioning a second facility for nanotube synthesis, known as Graphetron 50. In 2020 the company will increase its capacity to 310 tonnes by setting up the world’s largest production facility in Luxembourg. \n\nIn December 2014 Frost & Sullivan recognized the OCSiAl Group with its 2014 North American Award for Technology Innovation for OCSiAl’s TUBALL SWCNT products. The award was given for the high purity and large-scale production capability of TUBALL products, which has significantly increased the commercialization potential of single wall carbon nanotube products.\n\nIn 2015, the National Nanotechnology Initiative (NNI), a United States government program to accelerate nanotechnology commercialization, recognized OCSiAl for expanding its matching grant program (iNanoComm) for exploratory research with SWCNT.\n\nIn September 2016, OCSiAl registered its core product TUBALL through the EU’s Registration, Evaluation, Authorisation and Restriction of Chemicals (REACH) regulation under the number 01-2120130006-75-0000. As of November 2016 OCSiAl is the only company with the license toproduce and commercialize up to 10 tonnes of nanotubes in Europe annually.\n\nThe company’s core product is TUBALL, high-purity graphene nanotubes that can be used as a universal additive for a wide range of materials. Graphene nanotube is an extremely thin rolled-up sheet of graphene. The key advantage of graphene nanotubes centers around the very low loadings, starting at 0.01%, that are sufficient for achieving uniform and permanent conductivity while also reinforcing mechanical properties. The very low loadings made possible by SWCNT provide the ability to maintain the original color and minimally impact secondary properties of most materials.\n\nOCSiAl has also developed nanotube-based concentrates that simplify graphene nanotubes use in various materials. In 2015 the company opened a research facility focused on nanotubes applications for batteries, elastomers, paints and coatings, thermoplastic, and thermoset materials.\n\nTUBALL-based masterbatches use rubber polymers, fillers and oil plasticizers as nanotube carriers, allowing performance improvements with minimal changes to the composition of a rubber compound. In October 2016 LANXESS and OCSiAl announced new nanotubes products targeting reinforced and conductive latex rubbers.\n\nTUBALL nanotubes bring performance improvements to Li-ion and lead–acid batteries, and to supercapacitors and fuel cells. In these applications SWCNT has the potential to replace carbon black and other carbon-based additives, with a study by Aleees demonstrating 10% higher volumetric energy density and decreasing cathode thickness by 18% in 10 Ah pouch cells. In another study by Aleees, SWCNT-coated foils showed an increase in energy delivered to cells by 0-252%, depending on the discharge rate. In trials of lead-acid batteries 0.001% of SWCNT in the electrode paste increased cycle life and rate capability five-fold.\n\nTUBALL nanotubes provide conductivity to colored and transparent coatings with minimal impact on color or transparency, while maintaining or increasing mechanical properties. Conductivity may be employed for ESD-control properties or electrostatic painting methods.\n\nIn November 2016 OCSiAl announced an agreement with BÜFA Composite Systems in Europe to provide TUBALL nanotubes and TUBALL MATRIX nanotube concentrates for BÜFA-developed resin formulations. In 2017 BÜFA hit the market with its line of conductive gelcoats with colored, smooth and glossy surfaces. There are some particular applications where nanotube-based gelcoats can almost completely replace standard gelcoats. Pipes and tanks for chemicals, ventilation systems, printing rollers, control boxes for electronics, floor coatings at industrial production plants, tooling gelcoats and resins for composites, to name just a few. The companies noted that using graphene nanotubes in composites provides a conductive and reinforcing network at low loadings, enabling conductive parts to retain color and improve mechanical strength.\n\n"}

Luba graduated from Central High School, the second-oldest continuously public high school in the United States and one of the top high schools in the city and state. For college, Luba attended the University of Pennsylvania, and got a BSEE in Electrical Engineering. Thereafter, he went to Drexel University for two years to receive a MSEE in Electrical/Systems Engineering.\nIn 1997, Luba went on to receive his master's degree in Technology Management (EMTM) from the University of Pennsylvania. He completed it in 2001.\n\nIn August 1986, Luba began working at Lockheed Martin, then GE Aerospace, an American global aerospace, defense, security and advanced technology company with worldwide interests. He started working as an Associative Systems Engineer. He currently is a Principal Systems Engineer, and has worked at Lockheed Martin for over 28 years.\n\nLuba started working on the GPS III project in 2002 with his team, including Larry Boyd, Art Gower, and Jeff Crum. In 2005, completing their work, they wrote a paper, titled \"GPS III System Operations Concepts\", which outlined the creation of the GPS III, its uses in the Air Force, connectivity worldwide, and continuation of the GPS project. For over 3 years, he and his team \"analyzed potential operational concepts for the Air Force. The completed tasks support the government’s objective of a “realizable and operationally feasible” US Strategic Command (USSTRATCOM) and Air Force Space Command (AFSPC) concept of operations.\"\n\nStarting in 2013, Luba moved on to his new major project within Lockheed Martin. He began and runs the project LM WISDOM® ITI (Insider Threat Identification), the industry leader in detecting and mitigating insider threats. It is a cyber-security platform that analyzes threats for organizations.\nLM Wisdom collects and monitors information online, such as revolutions or political instability.\n\nOllie Luba, born Oleh Rostyslav Luba, is ethnically Ukrainian and speaks both English and Ukrainian. Both of his parents were born in Ukraine. Luba is a member of Plast, the largest Scouting organization in Ukraine, and the Institute of Navigation (ION), a non-profit professional organization for the advancement of the art and science of positioning, navigation and timing. His interests include Biking, Skiing, and Golf.\n\n"}

They are used on both surface ships and submarines. Data from the pitometer log is usually fed directly into the ship's navigation system.\n\nAll nautical instruments designed to measure the speed of a ship through water are known as logs.\n\nThis nomenclature dates back to days of sail when sailors tossed a log attached to rope knotted at regular intervals off the stern of a ship. The sailors would count the number of knots that passed through their hands in a given period of time. Today sailors still use the unit of knots to express a ship's speed. The speed of the ship was needed to navigate the ship using dead reckoning, which was standard practice in the days before modern navigation instruments like GPS.\n\nDuring World War II, pitometer logs were often interfaced directly into warship fire control systems. This interface was necessary to allow gunnery and torpedo fire control systems to automatically track targets.\n\nThe pitometer log was patented\nin 1899 by Edward Smith Cole.\n\nThe basic technology of the pitometer log is similar to that of the pitot tube on an aircraft. Typically, the pitometer has a long tube that penetrates the ship's hull near the keel. The part of the pitometer protruding from the ship is sometimes called a pit sword or rodmeter. This tube usually has two openings: one facing the direction of seawater motion that is used to measure the dynamic pressure of the seawater and one at 90° to the direction of seawater motion that is used to measure the static seawater pressure. The dynamic pressure of the seawater is a function of the depth of the water and the speed of the vessel.\n\nIn early realizations of the pitometer log, mercury manometers\n\nwere used to measure the pressure differences (see Figure 1). Later realizations used approaches that would generate equalizing pressures within the pitometer that would balance out the dynamic pressure. This eliminated the need for mercury manometers.\n\nAn expression can be derived for the velocity of water impacting the ship as a function of the difference in dynamic and static water pressure using Bernoulli's principle. The total pressure of the water in the tube with moving seawater can be described by Equation 1.\n\nSince water is an incompressible fluid, the dynamic pressure component of the total pressure can be expressed in terms of the water density and the water velocity as is shown in Equation 2. \n\nEquation 2 can be solved for the velocity of water in terms of the difference in pressure between the two legs of the manometer. Equation 3 shows that velocity is a function of the square root of the pressure difference. \nBecause the speed computed by the pitometer is a function of the difference between pressure readings, the pitometer does not produce an accurate result when the ship's velocity is low and the two pressure readings are nearly the same.\n\nWhile the pitometer log is very commonly used today, there are a number of other logs that are also in use. These logs include:\n"}
{"id": "2903127", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2903127", "title": "Profession (novella)", "text": "Profession (novella)\n\n\"Profession\" is a novella by Isaac Asimov. The story first appeared in the July 1957 issue of \"Astounding Science Fiction\" and was the lead story in the 1959 collection \"Nine Tomorrows\".\n\nThe author presents a centralized Earth society of the sixty-sixth century, in which children are educated by almost instantaneous direct computer/brain interface, a process known as \"taping\". This system is similar to the BrainCap, a concept later explored by Arthur C. Clarke. Besides educating its own people this way, Earth also supplies educated professionals to other planets, the Outworlds.\n\nPeople in this future society are taught to read at the age of eight and then Educated at the age of eighteen. Each person's professional speciality is dictated by an analysis of his or her brain, with no choices allowed to the subject. The best of the Educated people compete in professional \"Olympics\" in the hope of being \"bought\" by an advanced Outworld. To stay on Earth is almost an admission of failure. \n\nGeorge Platen is determined to be a Computer Programmer, a profession in demand, and he hopes to qualify for \"export\" to a top-flight Outworld. On Reading Day, however, concerns are raised about George's ability to be Educated. On George's Education Day, he is told that his brain is unfit for any form of Education. He is drugged and sent to a House for the Feeble Minded. \n\nAlthough not under physical guard, George stays in the House for a year, where the staff tolerates and even encourages his philosophical and intellectual ruminations as a way to pass the time. He is befriended by Omani, who seems to take a personal interest in George's plight. George then determines to escape, to leave and seek out Dr. Antonelli who told him he was feeble-minded, and confront him. \n\nGeorge visits the Olympics, which are happening in San Francisco at that time. He meets his friend Armand Trevelyan, who has been Taped as a 'Metallurgist, Nonferrous'. Trev is excited about his opportunities but performs poorly on the Beeman spectrograph — his Taping was inadequate regarding the new device—and he is forced to take employment on a fourth-rate Outworld. George, watching Trev bitterly depart, wishes him well. Trev turns and sarcastically asks, \"Well, what have you done?\" He then shakes George. A passing policeman breaks up the scuffle and asks George for his identity card. His ruse is up, he will be exposed as an Uneducated escapee. \n\nSuddenly a stranger appears. He gives the policeman his business card and takes possession of George. The stranger introduces himself as Ladislas Ingenescu, Registered Historian. George and Ingenescu enter into a long conversation about history, society, and progress. George impatiently demands, and Ingenescu obtains for him, an interview with a Novian, an Outworlder on Earth to purchase talent. The Outworlder knows Ingenescu personally. He expresses anger at the Registered Historian (why to a Registered Historian, George wonders?) over Earth continually introducing very minor changes to the Tapes — such as the recent addition of the Beeman spectrograph for Metallurgists — necessitating the Outworlds to keep spending money to stay up to date. The Registered Historian introduces George as someone who thinks he may have a better solution. George contends that people can learn in ways other than being Taped, such as by reading books and in discussion with those who already hold the desired knowledge. This baffles the Outworlder, who sees it only as a source of additional expense. He breaks off their conversation. George is dismayed; the Registered Historian offers condolences.\n\nGeorge is returned to the House and discovers the reality: the House is an Institute of Higher Studies. Those people who have the urge and persistence to create, even though they have been told otherwise about their abilities, are sent there to support the advancement of science and civilization. George has always been under constant observation, and it was subtly but deliberately suggested that he escape and seek out the doctor who sent him there. Reflecting on his experiences \"outside,\" George realizes that a man named Beeman would have to have been the inventor of the Beeman spectrograph. Beeman could not have been Tape-educated and still have created the new device. Someone has to program the Tapes that program the Educated, \"men and women with capacity for original thought.\" George's \"keepers\" in the Institute are revealed as sociologists, psychologists, historians, scientists, and other professionals who also demonstrated an innate capacity for original thought but not the stamina to keep fighting to express it. Their job is to help other determined, innovators like Georgea small fractionto avoid the same fate. The future of society is at stake.\n\nGeorge himself has one final question. He asks, \"Why do they call them Olympics?\".\n\n"}

It can relate to networking, electronics or physics.\n\nIn computer networks, propagation delay is the amount of time it takes for the head of the signal to travel from the sender to the receiver. It can be computed as the ratio between the link length and the propagation speed over the specific medium.\n\nPropagation delay is equal to \"d / s\" where \"d\" is the distance and \"s\" is the wave propagation speed. In wireless communication, \"s\"=\"c\", i.e. the speed of light. In copper wire, the speed \"s\" generally ranges from .59c to .77c. This delay is the major obstacle in the development of high-speed computers and is called the interconnect bottleneck in IC systems.\n\nIn electronics, digital circuits and digital electronics, the propagation delay, or gate delay, is the length of time which starts when the input to a logic gate becomes stable and valid to change, to the time that the output of that logic gate is stable and valid to change. Often on manufacturers' datasheets this refers to the time required for the output to reach 50% of its final output level when the input changes to 50% of its final input level. Reducing gate delays in digital circuits allows them to process data at a faster rate and improve overall performance. The determination of the propagation delay of a combined circuit requires identifying the longest path of propagation delays from input to output and by adding each tpd time along this path.\n\nThe difference in propagation delays of logic elements is the major contributor to glitches in asynchronous circuits as a result of race conditions.\n\nThe principle of logical effort utilizes propagation delays to compare designs implementing the same logical statement.\n\nPropagation delay increases with operating temperature, as resistance of conductive materials tends to increase with temperature. Marginal increases in supply voltage can increase propagation delay since the upper switching threshold voltage, V (often expressed as a percentage of the high-voltage supply rail), naturally increases proportionately. Increases in output load capacitance, often from placing increased fan-out loads on a wire, will also increase propagation delay. All of these factors influence each other through an RC time constant: any increase in load capacitance increases C, heat-induced resistance the R factor, and supply threshold voltage increases will affect whether more than one time constants are required to reach the threshold. If the output of a logic gate is connected to a long trace or used to drive many other gates (high fanout) the propagation delay increases substantially.\n\nWires have an approximate propagation delay of 1 ns for every of length. Logic gates can have propagation delays ranging from more than 10 ns down to the picosecond range, depending on the technology being used.\n\nIn physics, particularly in the electromagnetic field, the propagation delay is the length of time it takes for a signal to travel to its destination. For example, in the case of an electric signal, it is the time taken for the signal to travel through a wire. See also, velocity factor.\n\n"}

The criteria of stabilizing the work flow can be achieved by injecting lean manufacturing principles into the construction process flow. Lean construction is a new way to manage construction. The objective, principles and techniques of lean construction taken together form the basis for a rapid project delivery process. Unlike current approaches to managing construction (including design-build) and programmatic improvement efforts (partnering), lean construction provides the foundation for an operations based rapid construction project delivery system. While the transformation-flow-value theory broadens the understanding of project management, the perception of construction as a complex phenomenon opens up for the introduction of completely new approaches to project management. The ordered approach which gave rise to what can be called management-as-planning and management-as organizing should be reinterpreted and supplemented in future project management. Management as co-operation and as learning comes into focus. The consultant and contractor’s familiarity with the system led to significant reductions in construction time and improvements in overall economy. The use of material and workflow in this technology is to provide rapid construction, decrease environmental impacts, increase durability, and reduce on-site labour, resulting in better work zone safety.\n"}

By shining a spotlight on perfumery’s most outstanding creators, we hope to help generate support for independent practices in perfumery as a whole. The Art and Olfaction Awards are a program of The Institute for Art and Olfaction, a 501(c)3 non-profit organization based in Los Angeles, USA.\"\n\nThe Art and Olfaction Awards were founded in 2013 as a program of The Institute for Art and Olfaction in Los Angeles. The first awards ceremony took place in April, 2014, at Goethe Institut Los Angeles. At this first event, awards were given in two categories: Independent and Artisan.\n\nIn 2015, the awards expanded upon their existing categories by adding The Sadakichi Award for Experimental Work with Scent - named after the critic and writer Sadakichi Hartmann in honor of his failed scent concert from the early 20th century. The Sadakichi Award was added as \"a new category aimed at recognizing innovative uses of scent beyond the bounds of commercial perfumery\" - joining the artisan and independent awards to create what was intended as a broad snapshot of the diversity and creative potential in the field of perfume.\n\nThe third annual Art and Olfaction Awards were held on May 6, 2016 at Hammer Museum as part of their public programming. The expanded event was hosted by artist and producer Zackary Drucker, and was free, open to the public, and live streamed on the internet. In an effort to better cement the award's international commitment, the fourth annual Art and Olfaction Awards take place in May 2017 at Silent Green kulturquartier in Berlin. The finalists are announced yearly at Esxence in Milan.\n\nThe Art and Olfaction Awards were created as mechanism to impartially judge and promote work being done by artisan perfumers, independent perfume houses, and creative practitioners working with scent in the context of arts or experimental practices. Limited to artists, artisan perfumers and independent perfume houses (which they define as brands that are independently owned, or owned by another independently-owned company), they are closed to larger-scale perfume releases - a space already served by The Fragrance Foundation's Awards. In that capacity they have been compared to the film industry's Independent Spirit Awards. Indeed, the awards were created based on founder Saskia Wilson-Brown's experience with film festivals:\n\n\"\"The awards represented a chance to apply what I learned in the film festival world to the perfume world. In fact, we adapted many of the structures that go into running a film festival for the Art and Olfaction Awards, namely: Low entry fees, [...] unbiased judging (in many film festivals you are excluded from judging a film that you have a personal tie to), a diversity of judges, and a non-profit art for arts-sake motivation.”\"\n\nSeveral further systems were put into place to ensure fairness, including blind, multiple-phase judging. The result was what Luca Turin called '[...]the only fluff-free fragrance contest in the world'.\n\nThere are two artisan category winners out of ten finalists, two independent category winners out of ten finalists, and one Sadakichi Award for Experimental Work with Scent winner out of five finalists per year.

The band is also known as the myriameter band or myriameter wave as the wavelengths range from one to ten myriameters (an obsolete metric unit equal to 10 kilometers). Due to its limited bandwidth, audio (voice) transmission is highly impractical in this band, and therefore only low data rate coded signals are used. The VLF band is used for a few radio navigation services, government time radio stations (broadcasting time signals to set radio clocks) and for secure military communication. Since VLF waves can penetrate at least 40 meters (120 ft) into saltwater, they are used for military communication with submarines.\n\nBecause of their large wavelengths, VLF radio waves can diffract around large obstacles and so are not blocked by mountain ranges or the horizon, and can propagate as ground waves following the curvature of the Earth. The main mode of long distance propagation is an Earth-ionosphere waveguide mechanism. The Earth is surrounded by a conductive layer of electrons and ions in the upper atmosphere at the bottom of the ionosphere called the D layer at 60 to 90 km (37 to 56 miles) altitude, which reflects VLF radio waves. The conductive ionosphere and the conductive Earth form a horizontal \"duct\" a few VLF wavelengths high, which acts as a waveguide confining the waves so they don't escape into space. The waves travel in a zigzag path around the Earth, reflected alternately by the Earth and the ionosphere, in TM (transverse magnetic) mode.\n\nVLF waves have very low path attenuation, 2-3 dB per 1000 km, with little of the \"fading\" experienced at higher frequencies, This is because VLF waves are reflected from the bottom of the ionosphere, while higher frequency shortwave signals are returned to Earth from higher layers in the ionosphere, the F1 and F2 layers, by a refraction process, and spend most of their journey in the ionosphere, so they are much more affected by ionization gradients and turbulence. Therefore, VLF transmissions are very stable and reliable, and are used for long distance communication. Propagation distances of 5000 to 20000 km have been realized. However, atmospheric noise (sferics) is high in the band, including such phenomena as \"whistlers\", caused by lightning.\n\nVLF waves can penetrate seawater to a depth of at least 10 to 40 meters (30 to 130 feet), depending on the frequency employed and the salinity of the water, so they are used to communicate with submarines.\n\nVLF waves at certain frequencies have been found to cause electron precipitation.\n\nVLF waves used to communicate with submarines have created an artificial bubble around the Earth that can protect it from solar flares and coronal mass ejections; this occurred through interaction with high-energy radiation particles.\n\nA major practical drawback to this band is that because of the length of the waves, full size resonant antennas (half wave dipole or quarter wave monopole antennas) cannot be built because of their physical height. Vertical antennas must be used because VLF waves propagate in vertical polarization, but a quarter-wave vertical antenna at 30 kHz would be high. So practical transmitting antennas are electrically short, a small fraction of a wavelength long. Due to their low radiation resistance (often less than one ohm) they are inefficient, radiating only 10% to 50% of the transmitter power at most, with the rest of the power dissipated in the antenna/ground system resistances. Very high power transmitters (~1 megawatt) are required for long distance communication, so the efficiency of the antenna is an important factor.\n\nHigh power transmitting antennas for VLF frequencies are very large wire antennas, up to a mile across. They consist of a series of steel radio masts, linked at the top with a network of cables, often shaped like an umbrella or clotheslines. Either the towers themselves or vertical wires serve as monopole radiators, and the horizontal cables form a capacitive top-load to increase the efficiency of the antenna. High power stations use variations on the umbrella antenna such as the \"delta\" and \"trideco\" antennas, or multiwire flattop (triatic) antennas. For low power transmitters, inverted-L and T antennas are used. A large loading coil is required at the antenna feed point to cancel the capacitive reactance of the antenna to make it resonant.\n\nTo minimize power dissipated in the ground, these antennas require extremely low resistance ground systems. Because of soil resistance and dielectric losses in the ground, buried ground systems tend to have unacceptably high losses, and counterpoise systems are usually used, consisting of radial networks of copper cables supported several feet above the ground under the antenna, extending out radially from the mast or vertical element.\n\nThe high capacitance and inductance and low resistance of the antenna-loading coil combination makes it act electrically like a high Q tuned circuit. VLF antennas have very narrow bandwidth and to change the transmitting frequency requires a variable inductor (variometer) to tune the antenna. The large VLF antennas used for high power transmitters usually have bandwidths of only a few tens of hertz, and when transmitting frequency shift keying (FSK), the usual mode, the resonant frequency of the antenna must sometimes be dynamically shifted with the modulation, between the two FSK frequencies. The high Q of the antenna results in very high voltages at the ends of the horizontal topload wires where the nodes of the standing wave pattern occur, and very good insulation is required. The practical limit to the power of large VLF transmitters is usually determined by onset of air breakdown and arcing from the antenna. \n\nThe requirements for receiving antennas are less stringent, because of the high level of natural atmospheric noise in the band. Atmospheric radio noise is far above the receiver noise introduced by the receiver circuit and determines the receiver signal to noise ratio. So small inefficient receiving antennas can be used, and the low voltage signal from the antenna can simply be amplified by the receiver without introducing significant noise. Loop antennas are usually used for reception.\n\nThe frequency range below 9 kHz is not allocated by the International Telecommunication Union and may be used in some nations license-free.\n\nVLF is used to communicate with submarines near the surface (for example using the transmitter DHO38), while ELF is used for deeply submerged vessels. VLF is also used for radio navigation beacons (alpha) and time signals (beta).\n\nIn the USA, the time signal station WWVL began transmitting a 500 W signal on 20 kHz in August 1963. It used Frequency Shift Keying (FSK) to send data, shifting between 20 kHz and 26 kHz. The WWVL service was discontinued in July 1972.\n\nHistorically, this band was used for transcontinental radio communication during the wireless telegraphy era between about 1900 and 1925. Nations built networks of high power LF and VLF radio stations that transmitted text information by Morse code, to communicate with their colonies and naval fleets. Early attempts were made to use radiotelephone using amplitude modulation and single-sideband modulation within the band starting from 20 kHz, but the result was unsatisfactory because the available bandwidth was insufficient to contain the sidebands. The Grimeton VLF transmitter at Grimeton near Varberg in Sweden, one of the few remaining transmitters from that era that has been preserved as a historical monument, can be visited by the public at certain times, such as on Alexanderson Day.\n\nNaturally occurring signals in the VLF band are used for long range lightning location and for research into phenomena such as transient luminous events. Measurements of whistlers are employed to infer the physical properties of the magnetosphere.\n\nGeophysicists use VLF-electromagnetic receivers to measure conductivity in the near surface of the Earth.\n\nHigh power land-based and aircraft transmitters in countries that operate submarines send signals that can be received thousands of miles away. Transmitter sites typically cover great areas (many acres or square kilometers), with transmitted power anywhere from 20 kW to 2 MW. Submarines receive signals from land based and aircraft transmitters using some form of towed antenna that floats just under the surface of the water – for example a BCAA (Buoyant Cable Array Antenna). Modern receivers use sophisticated digital signal processing techniques to remove the effects of atmospheric noise (largely caused by lightning strikes around the world) and adjacent channel signals, extending the useful reception range. Strategic nuclear bombers of the United States Air Force receive VLF signals as part of hardened nuclear resilient operations.\n\nBecause of the low bandwidth available it is not possible to transmit audio signals, therefore all messaging is done with text data at very low bit rates. Three types of modulation are used:\n\nTwo alternative character sets may be used: 5-bit ITA2 or 8-bit ASCII. Because these are military transmissions they are almost always encrypted for security reasons. Although it is relatively easy to receive the transmissions and convert them into a string of characters, enemies cannot decode the encrypted messages; military communications usually use unbreakable one-time pad ciphers since the amount of text is so small.\n\nVLF signals are often monitored by radio amateurs using simple homemade VLF radio receivers based on personal computers (PCs). An aerial in the form of a coil of insulated wire is connected to the input of the soundcard of the PC (via a jack plug) and placed a few meters away from it. Fast Fourier transform (FFT) software in combination with a sound card allows reception of all frequencies below the Nyquist frequency simultaneously in the form of spectrogrammes. Because CRT monitors are strong sources of noise in the VLF range, it is recommended to record the spectrograms with any PC CRT monitors turned off. These spectrograms show many signals, which may include VLF transmitters and the horizontal electron beam deflection of TV sets. The strength of the signal received can vary with a sudden ionospheric disturbance. These cause the ionization level to increase in the ionosphere producing a rapid change to the amplitude and phase of the received VLF signal.\n\nRadio amateurs in some countries have been granted permission (or have assumed permission) to operate at frequencies below 8.3 kHz.\n\nRadiated power from amateur stations is very small, ranging from 1 μW to 100 μW for fixed base station antennas, and up to 10 mW from kite or balloon antennas. Despite the low power, stable propagation with low attenuation in the earth-ionosphere cavity enable very narrow bandwidths to be used to reach distances up to several thousand km. The modes used are QRSS, MFSK, and coherent BPSK.\n\nOperations tend to congregate around the frequencies 8.27 kHz, 6.47 kHz, 5.17 kHz and 2.97 kHz. Bandwidths of a few tens of uHz are typical and both receiver and transmitter must have their frequency locked to a stable reference such as a GPS disciplined oscillator or a rubidium standard.\n\nThe transmitter generally consists of an audio amplifier of a few hundred watts, an impedance matching transformer, a loading coil and a large wire antenna. Receivers employ an electric field probe or magnetic loop antenna, a sensitive audio preamplifier, isolating transformers, and a PC sound card to digitise the signal. Extensive digital signal processing is required to retrieve the weak signals from beneath interference from power line harmonics and VLF radio atmospherics. Useful received signal strengths are as low as  volts/meter (electric field) and  tesla (magnetic field), with signaling rates typically between 1 and 100 bits per hour.\n\nFor a more detailed list, see List of VLF-transmitters\n\n\n\n"}

The success of the well, drilled in 1912 by Thomas Baker Slick, Sr., led to the development of the Cushing field and gave impetus to the early development of Oklahoma oilfields. The Drumright-Cushing field would go on to produce 310,000 barrels of oil a day at its peak in May 1917. The well made Slick's name as \"King of the Wildcatters\".\n\nThe well was financed by Charles B. Shaffer of Chicago, who hired Slick to drill wells at the Frank Wheeler farm using cable tool drilling techniques, which could not prevent gushers or blowouts. Three unsuccessful wells preceded the strike, which initially produced 400 barrels of high-grade oil a day from a depth of between and . Because no mechanism existed to control the flow, the oil was diverted into pits for collection and storage. The source of the oil was a sand zone in the Drumright Dome, a syncline. Slick attempted to keep the strike secret, hiring armed guards, but eventually revealed the well's success in April 1912. A dugout built for the guards remains on the site, together with a commemorative plaque.\n\nIn time, the well's pressure subsided, requiring that the oil be pumped out of the well. The first pump was a two-cylinder gasoline-powered pump, later replaced by an electric drive. With the reduction in pressure the well was modified for secondary recovery, using an early form of hydraulic fracturing called \"sand fracturing.\" As of 1980 it produced about a barrel a day, pumping four hours a day. Oil came from three layers: the Layton layer at , the Wheeler layer at , and the Bartlesville layer at . A pipeline connects the well to an oil-water separating unit about away, then to storage tanks. The well is located in a small clearing about west of Drumright. The well was still producing in 2012.\n\nThe Wheeler No. 1 well was placed on the National Register of Historic Places on March 14, 1983.\n"}

AT&T followed in 1924, and RCA sent a \"Radiophoto\" in 1926. The Associated Press began its Wirephoto service in 1935 and held a trademark on the term \"AP Wirephoto\" between 1963 and 2004. The first AP photo sent by wire depicted the crash of a small plane in New York's Adirondack Mountains.\n\nTechnologically and commercially, the wirephoto was the successor to Ernest A. Hummel's Telediagraph of 1895, which had transmitted electrically scanned shellac-on-foil originals over a dedicated circuit connecting the \"New York Herald\" and the \"Chicago Times Herald\", the \"St. Louis Republic\", the \"Boston Herald\", and the \"Philadelphia Inquirer\".\n\nÉdouard Belin's Belinograph of 1913, which scanned using a photocell and transmitted over ordinary phone lines, formed the basis for the AT&T Wirephoto service. In Europe, services similar to a wirephoto were called a Belino.\n\nThe first wirephoto systems were slow and did not reproduce well. In 1929, Dr. Vladimir Zworykin, an electronics engineer working for Western Electric, came up with a system that produced a better reproduction and could transmit a full page in approximately one minute. \n\nIn the 1930s, wirephoto machines of any reasonable speed were very large and expensive and required a dedicated phone line. News media firms like Associated Press used expensive leased telephone lines to transmit wirephotos. In the mid-1930s a technology battle began for less expensive portable wirephoto equipment that could transmit photos over standard phone lines. A prototype device in the experimental stage was available in San Francisco in 1935 when the large Navy airship USS \"Macon\" crashed into the Pacific Ocean off the coast of California. A photo was taken and transmitted to New York City over regular phone lines. Later, a wirephoto copier and transmitter that could be carried anywhere and needed only a standard long-distance phone line was put into use by International News Photos.\n\nDuring the U.S. leaflet dropping campaign aimed towards the then Empire of Japan, near the end of WWII, Honolulu would transmit some radiophoto images to Saipan depicting proposed leaflet messages for the printing press on Saipan to produce.\n\n\n"}
