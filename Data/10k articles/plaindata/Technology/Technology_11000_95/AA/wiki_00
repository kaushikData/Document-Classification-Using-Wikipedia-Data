The Auro 11.1 cinema audio format is supported by Barco, a global visualization technology and digital cinema projection company.\n\nThe Auro 11.1 cinema sound format is an extension of the existing 5.1 surround sound format by incorporating height and overhead channels to allow for placement and panning of sound in the horizontal and vertical axis.\n\nAuro 11.1 is a channel-based system and thus differs in capability compared to competing formats such as Dolby Atmos and . The height layer allows for placement of background reflections and reverberations observed in nature as well as allowing for smooth panning from the base layer to the ceiling. However, the lack of a surround back-channel restricts panning due to lack of differentiation between the side and rear sector. Similarly, the use of arrays for surround and overhead channel also disallows pinpoint localization of sound along the walls as well as within the theater space. The Auromax format extends the capabilities of Auro 11.1 to approach Dolby Atmos and DTS:X.\n\nThe system uses Auro-3D Octopus codec, which allows the 12 channels to be compressed into 6 channels by utilizing the least significant bits for the additional channels and its metadata. This allows Auro 11.1 to be played as 5.1 in the absence of a decoder.\n\nThe first Auro 11.1 system was installed in May 2010 in Galaxy Studios and the format was launched at the spatial audio conference (AES) in October 2010 in Tokyo. By December 2014, 550 installations were committed and installed in theaters worldwide.\n\nThe first movie mixed in Auro 11.1 was Lucasfilm's \"Red Tails\", released in January 2012. On 1 November 2012, DreamWorks Animation announced that it would release 15 of its upcoming movies in the Auro 11.1 format.\n\nThe Auro 11.1 technological suite contains the Auro-Codec encoding - decoding plugins, Auro-Matic upmixer plugin and the Auro-Panner plugin.\n\nThe Auro 11.1 decoder is a firmware based solution compatible with Doremi cinema servers, that activates once the metadata in an Auro 11.1 stream is detected.

Stacked arrays of batwing antennas are used as television broadcasting antennas due to their omnidirectional characteristics. Batwing antennas generate a horizontally polarized signal. The advantage of the \"batwing\" design for television broadcasting is that it has a wide bandwidth. It was the first widely used television broadcasting antenna.\n\nBatwing antennas are a specialized type of crossed dipole antenna, a variant of the turnstile antenna. Two pairs of identical vertical batwing-shaped elements are mounted at right angles around a common mast. Element “wings” on opposite sides are fed as a dipole. To generate an omnidirectional pattern, the two dipoles are fed 90° out of phase. The antenna radiates horizontally polarized radiation in the horizontal plane. Each group of four elements at a single level is referred to as a \"bay\". The radiation pattern is close to omnidirectional but has four small lobes (maxima) in the directions of the four elements.\n\nTo reduce power radiated in the unwanted axial directions, in broadcast applications multiple bays fed in phase are stacked vertically with a spacing of approximately one wavelength, to create a collinear array. This generates an omnidirectional radiation pattern with increased horizontal gain (more of the energy radiated in horizontal directions and less into the sky or down at the earth), suitable for terrestrial broadcasting.\n\nThe \"batwing\" shape of the elements is used because it gives the antenna a wide bandwidth of approximately 20% of operating frequency at a VSWR of 1.1:1. This makes the antenna design suitable for broadcasters who wish to use a single antenna to transmit multiple television signals and thus made the batwing the preferred antenna for lowband TV stations (channels 2-6) in the early days of broadcast television.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "31250501", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=31250501", "title": "Connected car", "text": "Connected car\n\nA connected car is a car that is equipped with Internet access, and usually also with a wireless local area network. This allows the car to share internet access, and hence data, with other devices both inside as well as outside the vehicle. Often, the car is also outfitted with special technologies that tap into the internet or wireless LAN and provide additional benefits to the driver. For safety-critical applications, it is anticipated that cars will also be connected using dedicated short-range communications (DSRC) radios, operating in the FCC-granted 5.9 GHz band with very low latency.\n\nGeneral Motors was the first automaker to bring the first connected car features to market with OnStar in 1996 in Cadillac DeVille, Seville and Eldorado. OnStar was created by GM working with Motorola Automotive (that was later bought by Continental). The primary purpose was safety and to get emergency help to a vehicle when there was an accident. The sooner medical helps arrives the more likely the drivers and passengers would survive. A cellular telephone call would be routed to a call center where the agent sent help.\n\nAt first, OnStar only worked with voice but when cellular systems added data the system was able to send the GPS location to the call center. After the success of OnStar, many automakers followed with similar safety programs that usually come with a free trial for a new car and then a paid subscription after the trial is over.\n\nRemote diagnostics were introduced in 2001. By 2003 connected car services included vehicle health reports, turn-by-turn directions and a network access device. Data-only telematics were first offered in 2007.\n\nIn the summer of 2014, Audi was the first automaker to offer 4G LTE Wi-Fi Hotspots access and the first mass deployment of 4G LTE was by General Motors.\n\nBy 2015, OnStar had processed 1 billion requests from customers.\n\nIn the UK, the breakdown association 'The AA' introduced the first piece of connected car technology, in Car Genie that connects directly to a breakdown service, not only warning of issues with car health, but intervening directly with a phone call to customers to help them prevent a breakdown.<https://www.theaa.com/breakdown-cover/connected-car>\n\nThere are 5 ways a vehicle can be connected to its surroundings and communicate with them:\n\n\nApplications can be separated into two categories: 1.) single vehicle applications: In-car content and service applications implemented by a single vehicle in connection with a cloud or backoffice. 2.) cooperative safety and efficiency applications: they provide connectivity between vehicles (or infrastructure) directly have to work cross-brand and cross-borders and require standards and regulation. Some may be convenience applications, others safety, which may require regulation.\n\nExamples include, amongst others: \n1.) single-vehicle applications: concierge features provided by automakers or apps alert the driver of the time to leave to arrive on time from a calendar and send text message alerts to friends or business associates to alert them of arrival times such as BMW Connected NA that also helps find parking or gas stations. The European eCall would be an example of a single vehicle safety application that is mandatory in the EU.\n\n2.) cooperative safety-of-life and cooperative efficiency: forward collision warning, lane change warning/blind spot warning, emergency brake light warning, intersection movement assist, emergency vehicle approaching, road works warning, automatic notification of crashes, notification of speeding and safety alerts.\n\nThe connected car segment can be further classified into 8 categories.\n\n\nCurrent automobiles entail embedded navigation systems, smartphone integration and multimedia packages. Typically, a connected car made after 2010 has a head-unit, in car entertainment unit, in-dash system with a screen from which the operations of the connections can be seen or managed by the driver. Types of functions that can be made include music/audio playing, smartphone apps, navigation, roadside assistance, voice commands, contextual help/offers, parking apps, engine controls and car diagnosis.\n\nOn January 6, 2014, Google announced the formation of the Open Automotive Alliance (OAA) a global alliance of technology and auto industry leaders committed to bringing the Android platform to cars starting in 2014. The OAA includes Audi, GM, Google, Honda, Hyundai and Nvidia.\n\nOn March 3, 2014, Apple announced a new system to connect iPhone 5/5c/5S to car infotainment units using iOS 7 to cars via a Lightning connector, called CarPlay.\n\nAndroid Auto was announced on June 25, 2014 to provide a way for Android smartphones to connect to car infotainment systems.\n\nIncreasingly, Connected Cars (and especially electric cars) are taking advantage of the rise of smartphones, and apps are available to interact with the car from any distance. Users can unlock their cars, check the status of batteries on electric cars, find the location of the car, or remotely activate the climate control system.\n\nInnovations to be introduced until 2020 include the full integration of smartphone applications, such as the linkage of the smartphone calendar, displaying it on the car's windshield and automatic address searches in the navigation system for calendar entries. In the longer term, navigation systems will be integrated in the windshield and through augmented reality project digital information, like alerts and traffic information, onto real images from the driver's perspective.\n\nNear-term innovations regarding Vehicle Relationship Management (VRM) entail advanced remote services, such as GPS tracking and personalized usage restrictions. Further, maintenance services like over-the-air tune-ups, requiring the collaboration of car dealers, OEMs and service centers, are under development.\n\nDespite various market drivers there are also barriers that have prevented the ultimate breakthrough of the connected car in the past few years. One of these is the fact that customers are reluctant to pay the extra costs associated with embedded connectivity and instead use their smartphones as solution for their in-car connectivity needs. Because this barrier is likely to continue, at least in the short-term, car manufacturers are turning to smartphone integration in an effort to satisfy consumer demand for connectivity.\n\nThese services relate to Advanced Driver-Assistance Systems (ADAS), that depend on the sensory input of more than one vehicle and enable instant reaction through automatic monitoring, alerting, braking and steering activities. They depend on instant vehicle-to-vehicle communication, as well as infrastructure, functioning across brands and national borders and offering cross-brand and cross-border levels of privacy and security. The US National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) for that reason has argued for regulation in its Advance Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (ANPRM) on V2V Communication and argued the case in US Congress. NHTSA began the rule-making process on December 13, 2016, proposing to mandate dedicated short-range communications (DSRC) technology in new light vehicles. Under this proposed rule, vehicles would broadcast a defined data packet, the \"basic safety message\" (BSM) up to ten times per second, indicating vehicle location, heading, and speed. In March, 2017, GM became the first US automaker to provide DSRC as standard equipment on a production automobile, the Cadillac CTS. The US also has appropriate standards – IEEE 802.11p - and frequency rules in place. In Europe a frequency is harmonised for transport safety and a harmonised standard, called ETSI ITS-G5, are in place. In the EU there is no push to oblige vehicle manufacturers to introduce connect. Discussions about a regulatory framework for privacy and security are ongoing.\n\nTechnologically speaking cooperative applications can be implemented. Here the regulatory framework is the main obstacle to implementation, questions like privacy and security need to be addressed. British weekly \"The Economist\" even argues that the matter is regulatory driven.\n\nThe necessary hardware can be divided into built-in or brought-in connection systems. The built-in telematics boxes most commonly have a proprietary internet connection via a GSM module and are integrated in the car IT system. Although most connected cars in the United States use the GSM operator AT&T with a GSM SIM such as the case with Volvo, some cars such as the Hyundai Blue Link system utilizes Verizon Wireless Enterprise, a non-GSM CDMA operator.\n\nMost brought-in devices are plugged in the OBD (On-board diagnostics) port for electrification and access to vehicle data and can further be divided into two types of connection:\n\nAll forms of hardware have typical use cases as drivers. The built-in solutions were mostly driven by safety regulations in Europe for an automated Emergency Call (abbr. eCall). The brought-in devices usually focus on one customer segment and one specific use case.\n\nThe data provided by greater vehicle connectivity is impacting the car insurance industry. Predictive-modeling and machine-learning technologies, as well as real-time data streaming, providing among others information on driving speed, routes and time, are changing insurers' doing-of-business. Early adopters have begun to adjust their offering to the developments in the automotive industry, leading them to transition from being pure insurance product provider to becoming insurance-service hybrids.\n\nProgressive, for example, has introduced its usage-based-insurance program, Snapshot, in 2008, which takes into account driving times and ability. The data gathered through an onboard diagnostics device allows the company to perform further personal and regional risk assessments. \nAnother innovation being tested in the insurance industry regards telematics devices, which transmit vehicle and driver data through wide-area networks and are subsequently used to influence driving behavior, for legal purposes and the identification of fraudulent insurance claims. Further applications are dynamic risk profiles and improved customer segmentation.\nFuture services include coaching on driving skills for fuel efficiency and safety reasons, the prediction of maintenance needs and providing advise to car owners regarding the best time to sell their car.\n\nThe following trends are strengthening the shift towards a fully developed connected cars industry, changing the concept of what is understood as a car and what are its functions.\n\nTechnological innovation in the field of connectivity is accelerating. High-speed computers help make the car aware of its surroundings, which can transform manoeuvring a self-driving vehicle an increasing reality.\n\nFurther there are initiatives to use the ethernet technology to connect the sensors that allow for advanced driving assistance systems (ADAS). Through the ethernet network speed inside the vehicle can move from one megabit to gigabits. Further, It uses switches that allow connections to any number of devices, reducing the amount of cabling required and thus the overall weight of the car. Moreover, it is more scalable, allowing devices and sensors to connect at different speeds and has the benefit of components being available off the shelf.\n\nIn fact, research also shows that customers are willing to switch manufacturers just to be able to use mobile devices and connectivity. In 2014 there were 21% who were willing to do so whereas in 2015 this number climbed up to 37%. On top of that 32% of those customers would also be ready to pay for a service related to connectivity on top on a base model. This figure has been at 21% in 2014, one year before. The increase of customers willing to switch manufacturers and to pay for such services shows the increase in importance for connected cars.\n\nThe Internet of Things will be used to provide mobile services in the car with high-speed internet. This feature will enable real time traffic control, interaction with the car manufacturer service for remote diagnostics and improved company logistics automation. Moreover, in the beginning of the self-driven car era, internet will be used for information exchange between the cars for better route selection and accident reports.\n\nAlthough the connected car offers lots of benefits and excitement to the drivers, it also faces drawbacks and challenges;\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "44193", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=44193", "title": "DocBook", "text": "DocBook\n\nDocBook is a semantic markup language for technical documentation. It was originally intended for writing technical documents related to computer hardware and software but it can be used for any other sort of documentation.\n\nAs a semantic language, DocBook enables its users to create document content in a presentation-neutral form that captures the logical structure of the content; that content can then be published in a variety of formats, including HTML, XHTML, EPUB, PDF, man pages, Web help and HTML Help, without requiring users to make any changes to the source. In other words, when a document is written in DocBook format it becomes easily portable into other formats. It solves the problem of reformatting by writing it once using XML tags.\n\nDocBook is an XML language. In its current version (5.x), DocBook's language is formally defined by a RELAX NG schema with integrated Schematron rules. (There are also W3C XML Schema+Schematron and Document Type Definition (DTD) versions of the schema available, but these are considered non-standard.)\n\nAs a semantic language, DocBook documents do not describe what their contents \"look like\", but rather the \"meaning\" of those contents. For example, rather than explaining how the abstract for an article might be visually formatted, DocBook simply says that a particular section \"is\" an abstract. It is up to an external processing tool or application to decide where on a page the abstract should go and what it should look like or whether or not it should be included in the final output at all.\n\nDocBook provides a vast number of semantic element tags. They are divided into three broad categories: structural, block-level, and inline.\n\n\"Structural\" tags specify broad characteristics of their contents. The codice_1 element, for example, specifies that its child elements represent the parts of a book. This includes a title, chapters, glossaries, appendices, and so on. DocBook's structural tags include, but are not limited to:\n\n\nStructural elements can contain other structural elements. Structural elements are the only permitted top-level elements in a DocBook document.\n\n\"Block-level\" tags are elements like paragraph, lists, etc. Not all these elements can directly contain text. Sequential block-level elements render one \"after\" another. After, in this case, can differ depending on the language. In most Western languages, \"after\" means below: text paragraphs are printed down the page. Other languages' writing systems can have different directionality; for example, in Japanese, paragraphs are often printed in downward columns, with the columns running from right to left, so \"after\" in that case would be to the left. DocBook semantics are entirely neutral to these kinds of language-based concepts.\n\n\"Inline-level\" tags are elements like emphasis, hyperlinks, etc. They wrap text within a block-level element. These elements do not cause the text to break when rendered in a paragraph format, but typically they cause the document processor to apply some kind of distinct typographical treatment to the enclosed text, by changing the font, size, or similar attributes. (The DocBook specification \"does\" say that it expects different typographical treatment, but it does not offer specific requirements as to what this treatment may be.) That is, a DocBook processor doesn't have to transform an codice_15 tag into \"italics\". A reader-based DocBook processor could increase the size of the words, or, a text-based processor could use bold instead of italics.\n\nSemantically, this document is a \"book\", with a \"title\", that contains two \"chapters\" each with their own \"titles\". Those \"chapters\" contain \"paragraphs\" that have text in them. The markup is fairly readable in English.\n\nIn more detail, the root element of the document is codice_1. All DocBook elements are in an XML Namespace, so the root element has an \"xmlns\" attribute to set the current namespace. Also, the root element of a DocBook document must have a \"version\" that specifies the version of the format that the document is built on.\n\nA codice_1 element must contain a codice_18, or an codice_19 element containing a codice_18. This must be before any child structural elements. Following the title are the structural children, in this case, two codice_6 elements. Each of these must have a codice_18. They contain codice_23 block elements, which can contain free text and other inline elements like the codice_15 in the second paragraph of the first chapter.\n\nRules are formally defined in the DocBook XML schema. Appropriate programming tools can validate an XML document (DocBook or otherwise), against its corresponding schema, to determine if (and where) the document fails to conform to that schema. XML editing tools can also use schema information to avoid creating non-conforming documents in the first place.\n\nBecause DocBook is XML, documents can be created and edited with any text editor. A dedicated XML editor is likewise a functional DocBook editor. DocBook provides schema files for popular XML schema languages, so any XML editor that can provide content completion based on a schema can do so for DocBook. Many graphical or WYSIWYG XML editors come with the ability to edit DocBook like a word processor. \n\nBecause DocBook conforms to a well-defined XML schema, documents can be validated and processed using any tool or programming language that includes XML support.\n\nDocBook began in 1991 in discussion groups on Usenet and eventually became a joint project of HAL Computer Systems and O'Reilly & Associates and eventually spawned its own maintenance organization (the Davenport Group) before moving in 1998 to the \"SGML Open\" consortium, which subsequently became OASIS. DocBook is currently maintained by the \"DocBook Technical Committee\" at OASIS.\n\nDocBook is available in both SGML and XML forms, as a DTD. RELAX NG and W3C XML Schema forms of the XML version are available. Starting with DocBook 5, the RELAX NG version is the \"normative\" form from which the other formats are generated.\n\nDocBook originally started out as an SGML application, but an equivalent XML application was developed and has now replaced the SGML one for most uses. (Starting with version 4 of the SGML DTD, the XML DTD continued with this version numbering scheme.) Initially, a key group of software companies used DocBook since their representatives were involved in its initial design. Eventually, however, DocBook was adopted by the open source community where it has become a standard for creating documentation for many projects, including FreeBSD, KDE, GNOME desktop documentation, the GTK+ API references, the Linux kernel documentation, and the work of the Linux Documentation Project.\n\nUntil DocBook 5, DocBook was defined normatively by a Document Type Definition (DTD). Because DocBook was built originally as an application of SGML, the DTD was the only available schema language. DocBook 4.x formats can be SGML or XML, but the XML version does not have its own namespace.\n\nDocBook 4.x formats had to live within the restrictions of being defined by a DTD. The most significant restriction was that an element name uniquely defines its possible contents. That is, an element named codice_19 must contain the same information no matter where it is in the DocBook file. As such, there are many kinds of info elements in DocBook 4.x: codice_26, codice_27, etc. Each has a slightly different content model, but they do share some of their content model. Additionally, they repeat context information. The book's codice_19 element is that, because it is a direct child of the book; it does not need to be named specially for a human reader. However, because the format was defined by a DTD, it did have to be named as such. The root element does not have or need a \"version\", as the version is built into the DTD declaration at the top of a pre-DocBook 5 document.\n\nDocBook 4.x documents are not compatible with DocBook 5, but can be converted into DocBook 5 documents via an XSLT stylesheet. One (codice_29) is provided as part of the distribution of the DocBook 5 schema and specification package.\n\nDocBook files are used to prepare output files in a wide variety of formats. Nearly always, this is accomplished using DocBook XSL stylesheets. These are XSLT stylesheets that transform DocBook documents into a number of formats (HTML, XSL-FO for later conversion into PDF, etc.). These stylesheets can be sophisticated enough to generate tables of contents, glossaries, and indexes. They can oversee the selection of particular designated portions of a master document to produce different versions of the same document (such as a \"tutorial\" or a \"quick-reference guide\", where each of these consist of a subset of the material). Users can write their own customized stylesheets or even a full-fledged program to process the DocBook into an appropriate output format as their needs dictate.\n\nNorman Walsh and the DocBook Project development team maintain the key application for producing output from DocBook source documents: A set of XSL stylesheets (as well as a legacy set of DSSSL stylesheets) that can generate high-quality HTML and print (FO/PDF) output, as well as output in other formats, including RTF, man pages and HTML Help.\n\nWeb help is a chunked HTML output format in the DocBook XSL stylesheets that was introduced in version 1.76.1. The documentation for web help also provides an example of web help and is part of the DocBook XSL distribution.\n\nThe major features are its fully CSS-based page layout, search of the help content, and a table of contents in collapsible-tree form. Search has stemming, match highlighting, explicit page-scoring, and the standard multilingual tokenizer. The search and TOC are in a pane that appears as a frameset, but is actually implemented with div tags and cookies (so that it is progressive).\n\nThis web help format was originally implemented by Kasun Gajasinghe as part of the Google Summer of Code 2010 program.\n\nDocBook offers a large number of features that may be overwhelming to a new user. For those who want the convenience of DocBook without a steep learning curve, \"Simplified DocBook\" was designed. It is a small subset of DocBook designed for single documents such as articles or white papers (i.e., \"books\" are not supported).

In most of the combustion systems fuel and oxygen (or air) are separately supplied in the combustion chamber. Due to this chemical reaction and combustion occurs simultaneously in the combustion chamber. However, the rate of the chemical reaction is faster than the rate of mixing fuel and oxygen. Therefore, that rate of combustion is controlled by rate of mixing. Such cases, where formation of pre-mixture is difficult, are called diffusion combustion or diffusion flames.\n\nDiffusion flames can be laminar diffusion flames (e.g. candles and matches burning in the air etc.) or turbulent diffusion flames (e.g. furnaces, turbo-machinery, some liquid-fuel rocket engines and internal combustion engines) depending on the nature of mixed gas flow. Further, the flame shapes of this kind of burning are divided into two categories oxygen-rich diffusion flames and oxygen-deficient. Flame shapes also depend on the discharging velocity of fuel and air. Eddies inside the air flow plays an important role in deciding the flame shapes. With increase in discharging velocity of fuel into the air laminar diffusion flames tends to become turbulent diffusion flames. This leads to an increase in the flame height and finally it gains a maximum height (critical limit). After this limit further increase in the jet velocity of the fuel adds to instability of turbulent flame. The position where laminar flame is changing into turbulent flame is termed as \"break-up point\". Increase in jet velocity after critical limit results in decrease of the whole flame height. Beyond this point the height of the break-up point reaches a certain value where even after increasing the jet velocity of fuel the flame height will not change. Studies by Hawthorne et al. prove that the chemical reaction rates in turbulent diffusion flames and in laminar diffusion flames are almost similar.\n\nCombustion plays a vital role in many applications and a proper understanding of its effect on the system can be very helpful in designing the newer technologies and improving the existing ones. Nowadays, numerical modeling is a most effective tool for understanding and studying such problems. But a number of problems are associated with it such as:\n\nMany combustion models have been proposed. There is a long list of such models in literature but due to simplicity the eddy break-up model originally proposed by Spalding and later modified by Magnussen and Hjertager (eddy dissipation model (EDM)) became popular models. It is based on the assumption that the reaction rate is controlled by turbulent mixing because of the dependence of reaction rate on the mixing of the turbulent eddies. It is well documented that there are strong interactions between the turbulent flow and reactions. The heat released during the reaction affects the density and hence turbulence. While the turbulent flow induces changes concentration and temperature pulsations which enhance the mixing and heat transfer and affect the reaction rate. Turbulence also results in deformations in burning flame surface due to which folding occurs and the surface is also broken into pieces of different sizes. This enhances the total surface area of the flame and thus increases the combustible mixed gases burnt per unit time. Due to this, turbulent flames grow at a much faster rate than that of laminar flames.\n\nSpalding (1971) defined rate of fuel consumption as a function of local flow properties of fuel and oxidant. This model is based on a single step global infinitely fast stoichiometric chemical reaction.\n\n1 kg of fuel + s kg of oxidant→(1+s) kg of products\n\nFor \"m\" as mass fraction and \"M\" as molecular weight of species \"j\"; local density of mixture \"(ρ)\" is dependent on concentration of reactant and products and temperature of mixture. It can be mathematically calculated as:\n\nIt is used to express the turbulent dissipation rate of fuel \"(R)\", oxygen \"(R)\" and products \"(R)\" following the proposal from Magnussen and Hjertager as:\nWhere \"k\" is the turbulent kinetic energy, is the rate of dissipation of \"k\", and are model constants (value varies from 0.35 to 4). The reaction rate of fuel is considered to be smallest among all and is given by:\nThe model also leads to determination of mass fraction of product and oxygen using transport equation of mixture fraction \"(f)\"\n\nFor solving we need to first find the stociometric mixture fraction \"(f)\" when there is no fuel and oxygen is present in products, which is defined as \nAbove equations (7-9) not only shows linear relation of mixture fraction with mass fraction of oxygen and products but also helps in predicting their values. Magnussen and Hjertager (1976) utilize this model and conformity of experimental results with predictions supports this model. Several other researchers also justified the beauty of this model for fairly good predictions which are quite close to experimental results. Hence, this model is a topic of top priority due to its simplicity, steady convergence, and implementation in computational fluid dynamics (CFD) procedures.\n\n"}

EBWs use a different physical mechanism than blasting caps, using more electricity delivered much more rapidly, and explode in a much more precise timing after the electric current is applied, by the process of exploding wire method. This has led to their common use in nuclear weapons.\n\nThe slapper detonator is a more recent development along similar lines.\n\nThe EBW was invented by Luis Alvarez and Lawrence Johnston for the Fat Man–type bombs of the Manhattan Project, during their work in Los Alamos National Laboratory. The Fat Man Model 1773 EBW detonators used an unusual, high reliability detonator system with two EBW \"horns\" attached to a single booster charge, which then fired each of the 32 explosive lens units.\n\nEBWs were developed as a means of detonating multiple explosive charges simultaneously, mainly for use in plutonium-based nuclear weapons in which a plutonium core (called a \"pit\") is compressed very rapidly. This is achieved via conventional explosives placed uniformly around the pit. The implosion must be highly symmetrical or the plutonium would simply be ejected at the low-pressure points. Consequently, the detonators must have very precise timing.\n\nAn EBW has two main parts: a piece of fine wire which contacts the explosive, and a high-voltage high-current low-impedance electricity source; it must reliably and consistently supply a rapid starting pulse. When the wire is connected across this voltage, the resulting high current melts and then vaporizes the wire in a few microseconds. The resulting shock and heat initiate the high explosive.\n\nThis accounts for the heavy cables seen in photos of the Trinity \"Gadget\"; high voltage cable requires good insulation and they had to deliver a large current with little voltage drop, lest the EBW not achieve the phase transition quickly enough.\n\nThe precise timing of EBWs is achieved by the detonator using direct physical effects of the vaporized bridgewire to initiate detonation in the detonator's booster charge. Given a sufficiently high and well known amount of electric current and voltage, the timing of the bridgewire vaporization is both extremely short (a few microseconds) and extremely precise and predictable (standard deviation of time to detonate as low as a few tens of nanoseconds).\n\nConventional blasting caps use electricity to heat a bridge wire rather than vaporize it, and that heating then causes the primary explosive to detonate. Imprecise contact between the bridgewire and the primary explosive changes how quickly the explosive is heated up, and minor electrical variations in the wire or leads will change how quickly it heats up as well. The heating process typically takes milliseconds to tens of milliseconds to complete and initiate detonation in the primary explosive. This is roughly 1,000 to 10,000 times longer and less precise than the EBW electrical vaporization.\n\nSince explosives detonate at typically 7–8 kilometers per second, or 7–8 meters per millisecond, a 1 millisecond delay in detonation from one side of a nuclear weapon to the other would be longer than the time the detonation would take to cross the weapon. The time precision and consistency of EBWs (0.1 microsecond or less) are roughly enough time for the detonation to move 1 millimeter at most, and for the most precise commercial EBWs this is 0.025 microsecond and about 0.2 mm variation in the detonation wave. This is sufficiently precise for very low tolerance applications such as nuclear weapon explosive lenses.\n\nIn the US, due to their common use in nuclear weapons, these devices are subject to the nuclear control authorities in every state, according to the Guidelines for the Export of Nuclear Material, Equipment and Technology. EBWs are on the US State Department Munitions Control List, and exports are highly regulated.\n\nEBWs have found uses outside nuclear weapons, such as the Titan IV, safety conscious applications where stray electrical currents might detonate normal blasting caps, and applications requiring very precise timing for multiple point commercial blasting in mines or quarries. EBW detonators are much safer than regular electric detonators because unlike regular detonators EBWs do not have primary explosives. Primary explosives such as lead azide are very sensitive to static electricity, radio frequency, shock, etc.\n\nThe bridgewire is usually made of gold, but platinum or gold/platinum alloys can also be used. The most common commercial wire size is 0.038 mm (1.5 mils) in diameter and 1 mm (40 mils) in length, but lengths ranging from 0.25 mm to 2.5 mm (10 mils to 100 mils) can be encountered. From the available explosives, only PETN at low densities can be initiated by sufficiently low shock to make its use practical in commercial systems as a part of the EBW initiator. It can be chained with another explosive booster, often a pellet of tetryl, RDX or some PBX (e.g., PBX 9407). Detonators without such booster are called \"initial pressing detonators\" (IP detonators).\n\nDuring initiation, the wire heats with the passing current until melting point is reached. The heating rate is high enough that the liquid metal has no time to flow away, and heats further until it vaporizes. During this phase the electrical resistance of the bridgewire assembly rises. Then an electric arc forms in the metal vapor, leading to drop of electrical resistance and sharp growth of the current, quick further heating of the ionized metal vapor, and formation of a shock wave. To achieve the melting and subsequent vaporizing of the wire in time sufficiently short to create a shock wave, a current rise rate of at least 100 amperes per microsecond is required.\n\nIf the current rise rate is lower, the bridge may burn, perhaps causing deflagration of the PETN pellet, but it will not cause detonation. PETN-containing EBWs are also relatively insensitive to a static electricity discharge. Their use is limited by the thermal stability range of PETN. (cf. slapper detonators, which can use high density hexanitrostilbene, allowing their use in temperatures up to almost 300 °C and at both vacuum and at high pressures.)\n\nThe EBW and the slapper detonator are the safest known types of detonators, as only a very high-current fast-rise pulse can successfully trigger them. However, they require a bulky power source for the current surges required. The extremely short rise times are usually achieved by discharging a low-inductance, high-capacitance, high-voltage capacitor (e.g., oil-filled, Mylar-foil, or ceramic) through a suitable switch (spark gap, thyratron, krytron, etc.) into the bridge wire. A very rough approximation for the capacitor is a rating of 5 kilovolts and 1 microfarad, and the peak current ranges between 500 and 1000 amperes. The high voltage may be generated using a Marx generator. Low-impedance capacitors and low-impedance coaxial cables are required to achieve the necessary current rise rate.\n\nThe flux compression generator is one alternative to capacitors. When fired, it creates a strong electromagnetic pulse, which is inductively coupled into one or more secondary coils connected to the bridge wires or slapper foils. A low energy density capacitor equivalent to a compression generator would be roughly the size of a soda can. The energy in such a capacitor would be ·C·V, which for the above-mentioned capacitor is 12.5 J. (By comparison, a defibrillator delivers ~200 J from 2 kV and perhaps 20 µF. The flash-strobe in a disposable camera is typically 3 J from a 300 V capacitor of 100 µF.)\n\nIn a fission bomb, the same or similar circuit is used for powering the neutron trigger, the initial source of fission neutrons.\n\n\n"}

It was invented in 1992 at Tokyo Institute of Technology by Katsuhisa Furuta and his colleagues. It is an example of a complex nonlinear oscillator of interest in control system theory. The pendulum is underactuated and extremely non-linear due to the gravitational forces and the coupling arising from the Coriolis and centripetal forces. Since then, dozens, possibly hundreds of papers and theses have used the system to demonstrate linear and non-linear control laws. The system has also been the subject of two texts.\n\nDespite the great deal of attention the system has received, very few publications successfully derive (or use) the full dynamics. Many authors have only considered the rotational inertia of the pendulum for a single principal axis (or neglected it altogether). In other words, the inertia tensor only has a single non-zero element (or none), and the remaining two diagonal terms are zero. It is possible to find a pendulum system where the moment of inertia in one of the three principal axes is approximately zero, but not two.\n\nA few authors have considered slender symmetric pendulums where the moments of inertia for two of the principal axes are equal and the remaining moment of inertia is zero. Of the dozens of publications surveyed for this wiki only a single conference paper and journal paper were found to include all three principal inertial terms of the pendulum. Both papers used a Lagrangian formulation but each contained minor errors (presumably typographical).\n\nThe equations of motion presented here are an extract from a paper on the Furuta pendulum dynamics derived at the University of Adelaide.\n\nConsider the rotational inverted pendulum mounted to a DC motor as shown in Fig. 1. The DC motor is used to apply a torque formula_1 to Arm 1. The link between Arm 1 and Arm 2 is not actuated but free to rotate. The two arms have lengths formula_2 and formula_3. The arms have masses formula_4 and formula_5 which are located at formula_6 and formula_7 respectively, which are the lengths from the point of rotation of the arm to its center of mass. The arms have inertia tensors formula_8 and formula_9 (about the centre of mass of the arm). Each rotational joint is viscously damped with damping coefficients formula_10 and formula_11, where formula_10 is the damping provided by the motor bearings and formula_11 is the damping arising from the pin coupling between Arm 1 and Arm 2.\n\nA right hand coordinate system has been used to define the inputs, states and the Cartesian coordinate systems 1 and 2. The coordinate axes of Arm 1 and Arm 2 are the principal axes such that the inertia tensors are diagonal.\n\nThe angular rotation of Arm 1, formula_14, is measured in the horizontal plane where a counter-clockwise direction (when viewed from above) is positive. The angular rotation of Arm 2, formula_15, is measured in the vertical plane where a counter-clockwise direction (when viewed from the front) is positive. When the Arm is hanging down in the stable equilibrium position formula_16 .\n\nThe torque the servo-motor applies to Arm 1, formula_1, is positive in a counter-clockwise direction (when viewed from above). A disturbance torque, formula_18, is experienced by Arm 2, where a counter-clockwise direction (when viewed from the front) is positive.\n\nBefore deriving the dynamics of the system a number of assumptions must be made. These are:\n\nThe non-linear equations of motion are given by\n\nformula_19\n\nand\n\nformula_20\n\nMost Furuta pendulums tend to have long slender arms, such that the moment of\ninertia along the axis of the arms is negligible. In addition, most arms have\nrotational symmetry such that the moments of inertia in two of the principal axes\nare equal. Thus, the inertia tensors may be approximated as follows:\n\nformula_21\n\nformula_22\n\nFurther simplifications are obtained by making the following substitutions. The\ntotal moment of inertia of Arm 1 about the pivot point (using the parallel axis\ntheorem) is formula_23. The total moment of inertia of Arm 2 about its pivot\npoint is formula_24. Finally, define the total moment of inertia the motor\nrotor experiences when the pendulum (Arm 2) is in its equilibrium position\n(hanging vertically down), formula_25.\n\nSubstituting the previous definitions into the governing DEs gives the more\ncompact form\n\nformula_26\n\nand\n\nformula_27\n\n\n\n"}

It is headquartered in Hong Kong, but has offices in various countries including Poland, the Netherlands and China. The site claims to have over 16 million customers, 400,000 sellers, 75,000 digital products and 700 employees throughout all locations. The main product offering on G2A.COM is game key codes to such platforms as Steam, Origin and Xbox. Other products found on the marketplace include software and prepaid activation codes.\n\nG2A.COM does not purchase or sell any digital products itself, it delivers the platform for others to do so, acting as an intermediary by connecting the buyer to the seller. For frequent customers, G2A runs a subscription program called G2A Shield. Besides the marketplace, G2A has a lineup of other products and services, including G2A Direct, a partnership program for video game developers, and G2A Pay, an online checkout gateway. G2A is also involved in eSports, and sponsors professional gaming teams such as Cloud9, Natus Vincere, and Virtus Pro.\n\nThe company (under the original name Go2Arena) was established in 2010 by Bartosz Skwarczek and Dawid Rożek in Rzeszów, Poland as an online game retailer. G2A.COM's main demographic was young gamers with a lack of disposable income, so its objective became to sell video games at the lowest possible price. Skwarczek said that he had approached many large game developers at various events such as Gamescom, E3 and G-Star to secure partnership deals in order to become an official seller of their games. Due to a lack of interest from developers, as well as variations in market trends, the company’s business model changed from retailer to marketplace.\n\nStarting in 2015, G2A began to focus on other projects and products outside of its digital gaming marketplace. In January 2015, G2A introduced its online payment gateway G2A PAY – a checkout solution for businesses which currently integrates over 200 global payment methods. Later that same year, G2A created its first virtual reality application G2A Land, a VR amusement park.\n\nUntil early 2018, the platform allowed 3D print designers to create their personal store, where they could sell their designs or offer them for free. In July 2016, G2A launched G2A Direct, a partnership program for video game developers and publishers. In December 2016, G2A introduced two new projects – G2A Gear and Blunt Force. G2A Gear is an online shop which sells G2A branded clothing, as well as clothing and accessories with images and slogans from games, movies, TV shows, and comics. The company claims it will soon add items designed in partnership with gaming streamers and YouTubers to the store.\n\n2016 numbers show the platform has processed 22 million transactions throughout the entire G2A ecosystem, which is valued at $313 million.\n\nIn conjunction with MWU 3D MODELS project, led by Assoc. Prof. Marcin Wiechec of the Jagiellonian University, G2A is devising new methods in order to teach doctors how to better detect congenital heart issues among infants.\n\nG2A began a partnership with Microsoft in 2017 that would utilize Azure cloud technology to help minimize the risk of potential fraud.\n\nIn February 2018, G2A Dev Studio, a department responsible for VR projects, became an independent video game studio, Monad Rock.\n\nIn July 2018, a new product category was introduced to G2A Marketplace – electronics and merchandise tailored to gamers. In August 2018, the category was made available in seven European countries: Poland, Italy, Spain, Sweden, Romania, the UK and the Czech Republic.\n\nThroughout 2014 and 2015, G2A established partnerships with numerous eSports teams such as Cloud9, Natus Vincere, and Virtus Pro and has invested over 10 million USD in the industry to date.\n\nIn August 2016, G2A partnered with Sporting Clube de Portugal, who had previously signed Portuguese FIFA player, Francisco Cruz.\n\nIn December 2016, G2A.COM became the title sponsor of the biggest Exhibition & Congress Center in the Subcarpathian Voivodeship of Poland. The center, located next to Rzeszow International Airport, has been renamed G2A Arena. \n\nG2A states it collaborates with many YouTubers and streamers such as PewDiePie, Towelliee, Maximus Black and Castro 1021.\n\nG2A, partnered with Bachir \"Athene\" Boumaaza, the creator of Gaming for Good, and created the Humanitarian Emergency All-Out Response Team (HEART). Both projects were designed to help and support children, charities and aid in disaster relief. G2A states that it has been working with Gaming for Good since 2013 and had previously partnered with Boumaaza in projects like Gamers got Hearts.\n\nBetween 2014–2015, G2A says that it raised over 500,000 USD for SaveTheChildren which was then amplified to five million USD.\n\nOn 1 December 2015, multiple Twitch.tv streamers, YouTubers, websites and gamers participated in a program dubbed #GamingTuesday in order to raise funds for the charity Save the Children.\n\nIn January 2016, G2A states that it participated in the Polish charity auction event, The Great Orchestra of Christmas Charity Foundation, and bought a tall statue of the character Geralt of Rivia from the game \"The Witcher\".\n\nIn the first half of 2016, G2A won seven international awards in multiple categories including Customer Service, New Product and Virtual Reality.\n\nIn 2016, G2A was recognized at the Stevie Awards For Sales & Customer Service.\n\nIn 2016, G2A received awards for Outstanding Fast-Growth Business, Outstanding Customer Service Team, Outstanding New Product / Service at the Global Business Excellence Awards.\n\nIn 2016, G2A was presented with an award for Innovation in Customer Experience at the UK Financial Services Awards.\n\nIn 2017, G2A won Business Insider's \"Innovation Initiator\" award.\n\nIn 2017, eBay HK (Hong Kong) awarded G2A the Best Deal of the Year.\n\nG2A has been subject to a number of controversies regarding the validity of the sources for its keys. Publishers and journalists consider G2A to be a grey marketplace for redemption keys, often allowing the reselling of keys purchased in one regional market at a much lower price into another region where the same game is priced much higher, a legal route but one that denies publishers some profit in the latter region. They also claim that as basically G2A acts as an intermediary for individuals selling their keys, keys bought with stolen credit cards are sold, ensuring cheap prices for these keys.\n\nG2A had countered those claims, stating that their critics do not understand their business model, and have implemented programs like G2A Direct and G2A Shield to assure publishers still get a proper share of key resales and customers are protected from fake keys, respectively. However, some game developers involved in the G2A Direct program claim that they only did so because they \"couldn’t get G2A to take down the keys for (their) games that were already on sale\".\n\nIn July 2017, to further provide transparency in their business model in response to complaints, G2A started requiring all key resellers to disclose their identity and address, and require all purchasers to confirm their geolocation as to apply proper VAT taxes.\n\nSergei Klimov, the owner of the Lithuania studio behind \"Gremlins, Inc.\", Charlie Oscar, said that G2A itself is not a problem but instead the mismanagement of indie owners with their keys when they participate in game bundles or other programs that require them to generate a large number of keys, alongside the nature of economics between Eastern European companies and those in Western Europe and North America. Klimov said that just as retail boxes could sit in shelves, unsold, keys provided in bundles could remain unsold or unused, and that a site like G2A is inevitable to offload and resell those keys.\n\nRiot Games, developer of League of Legends, banned G2A from sponsoring teams during the 2015 League of Legends World Championship. Riot believed the keys sold on G2A were illegally obtained and made further claims that G2A was selling fully leveled accounts, which breached Riot's terms of service.\n\nG2A replied that it had tried hard to find a \"win-win\" situation in order to resolve the issues with Riot Games and had banned accounts selling Elo-boosted League of Legends accounts, which was a key factor behind the ban. G2A claimed that Riot did not cooperate with it in its attempts to fix the issue and Riot instead made further demands such as banning the sale of game guides on G2A’s marketplace.\n\nINTZ’s Tockers Gabriel 'Tockers' Claumann, was later fined over 1,000 USD at Campeonato Brasileiro de League of Legends (CBLoL) 2016, for wearing a shirt with the G2A website logo on the shoulder. Midway through the game, he was asked to apply masking tape over the logo and later told he would be fined. G2A paid this fine, stating that \"no e-sports organization should be punished so severely for wearing a G2A branded T shirt.\"\n\nIn June 2016, CEO of tinyBuild, Alex Nichiporchik, accused G2A of allowing key resellers to resell fraudulently-obtained game keys, costing the company 450,000 USD. G2A responded to tinyBuild's claims, stating that it offered to help to identify which keys had been fraudulently purchased as to determine which resellers had committed illegal chargebacks and remove them from G2A. G2A also questioned the 450,000 USD figure arrived at by tinyBuild, noting that its games had either been discounted several times on other sites or given away for free and consequently felt the figure was inflated. tinyBuild added that in communication with G2A, the company felt it was being pressured to participate in G2A's payment platform, which would take some of the sales revenue back to G2A, in exchange for rooting out fraud on its platform.\n\nThe official G2A statement went on to say that it \"gives full support to developers with prompt communication channels, uses advanced tools (exchanging blacklists, identifying suspicious merchants and auctions and 'KYC'-Know Your Customers procedures), and offers award-winning protection solutions with G2A Shield.\"\n\nFollowing this debate, G2A announced strengthened front-end verification steps for its marketplace security which included social media profile and phone number verification, with further verification required after 10 or more products have been sold through one account while introducing its and publisher partnership program G2A Direct.\n\nOn 3 April 2017, Gearbox Publishing announced a partnership with G2A.COM for exclusive collector’s editions of \"\", to be created and sold by G2A. YouTube game critic John \"TotalBiscuit\" Bain was critical of this move, citing G2A’s negative press coverage as well as accusations made against the company, and threatened to withhold covering \"Bulletstorm\", or any other Gearbox game, unless Gearbox cancelled the deal. On 6 April 2017, one day before \"Bulletstorm: Full Clip Edition\" was due for release, Gearbox published a list of ultimatums made together with Bain for G2A to accept, or else it would back out of the deal. The ultimatums focused on G2A’s Shield service, an open API for game developers, and G2A’s payment system. The following day, Gearbox Publishing publicly announced that it is ending its cooperation with G2A, due to a lack of response from the company concerning the ultimatums. G2A responded to the assertions on 10 April 2017 stating, \"All of the requests made of G2A.COM in the ultimatum have in fact long been part of our marketplace\", and ascribed the problems to the unfamiliarities that Bain and Gearbox have in regards to how G2A operates its marketplace.\n\n"}

The prize, named the H2 Refuel H-Prize and worth $1 million, was awarded in January 2017, to the consortium \"SimpleFuel\". \n\nLegislation for the prize, introduced by Rep. Bob Inglis, passed the United States House of Representatives in May 2006 as , but did not receive a vote in the United States Senate. After being reintroduced by Rep. Dan Lipinski at the beginning of a new term in January 2007, it was eventually folded into the Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007, which passed both the House of Representatives and the Senate and was then signed into law in December 2007.\n\nThe bill authorized $50 million in prize money, for the period from fiscal year 2008 to fiscal year 2017. However, in order to be spent, these funds must also be included in Congress's annual appropriation bills. The law provides for three categories of prizes:\n\n\nIn October 2008, the Hydrogen Education Foundation of Washington, D.C. was selected to administer the H-Prize along with SCRA, a South Carolina research foundation.\n\nIn August 2009, the Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy (EERE) of the U.S. Department of Energy announced a $1 million prize for innovative hydrogen storage materials which would be awarded in February 2011. However, the prize was never awarded as no competitor met the competition requirements.\n\nIn March 2014, EERE announced plans for a $1 million H2 Refuel H-Prize, and the Prize competition was launched in October 2014. The competition focused on developing small hydrogen refueling stations that can generate hydrogen from electricity or natural gas and dispense it to vehicles at least 1 kg at a time. The winner, SimpleFuel, was announced in January 2017, after building a prototype system and successfully completing the testing period. SimpleFuel was a consortium of three companies, PDC Machines, Ivys, Inc, and McPhy Energy North America. \n\n\n"}

{"id": "1508678", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1508678", "title": "Kansei engineering", "text": "Kansei engineering\n\nKansei engineering (Japanese: 感性工学 \"kansei kougaku\", emotional or affective engineering) aims at the development or improvement of products and services by translating the customer's psychological feelings and needs into the domain of product design (i.e. parameters). It was founded by Mitsuo Nagamachi, Professor Emeritus of Hiroshima University (also former Dean of Hiroshima International University and CEO of International Kansei Design Institute). Kansei engineering parametrically links the customer's emotional responses (i.e. physical and psychological) to the properties and characteristics of a product or service. In consequence, products can be designed to bring forward the intended feeling.\n\nIt has now been adopted as one of the topics for professional development by the Royal Statistical Society.\n\nProduct design on today's markets has become increasingly complex since products contain more functions and have to meet increasing demands such as user-friendliness, manufacturability and ecological considerations. With a shortened product lifecycle, development costs are likely to increase. Since errors in the estimations of market trends can be very expensive, companies therefore perform benchmarking studies that compare with competitors on strategic, process, marketing, and product levels. However, success in a certain market segment not only requires knowledge about the competitors and the performance of competing products, but also about the impressions which a product leaves to the customer. The latter requirement becomes much more important as products and companies are becoming mature. Customers purchase products based on subjective terms such as brand image, reputation, design, impression etc.. A large number of manufacturers has started to consider such subjective properties and develop their products in a way that conveys the company image. A reliable instrument is therefore needed: an instrument which can predict the reception of a product on the market before the development costs become too large.\n\nThis demand has triggered the research dealing with the translation of the customer's subjective, hidden needs into concrete products. Research is done foremost in Asia, including Japan and Korea. In Europe, a network has been forged under the 6th EU framework. This network refers to the new research field as \"emotional design\" or \"affective engineering\".\n\nNowadays, people want to use products that are functional at the physical level, usable at the psychological level and attractive at the subjective, emotional level. Affective engineering is the study of the interactions between the customer and the product at that third level. It focuses on the relationships between the physical traits of a product and its affective influence on the user. Thanks to this field of research, it is possible to gain knowledge on how to design more attractive products and make the customers satisfied.\n\nMethods in affective engineering (or Kansei engineering) is one of the major areas of ergonomics (human factor engineering ). The study of integrating affective values in artefacts is not new at all. Already in the 18th century philosophers such as Baumgarten and Kant established the area of aesthetics. In addition to pure practical values, artefacts always also had an affective component. One example is jewellery found in excavations from the stone ages. The period of Renaissance is also a good example.\n\nIn the middle of the 20th century, the idea of aesthetics was deployed in scientific contexts. Charles E. Osgood developed his semantic differential method in which he quantified the peoples' perceptions of artefacts. Some years later, in 1960, Professors Shigeru Mizuno and Yoji Akao developed an engineering approach in order to connect peoples' needs to product properties. This method was called quality function deployment (QFD). Another method, the Kano model, was developed in the field of quality in the early 1980s by Professor Noriaki Kano, of Tokyo University. Kano's model is used to establish the importance of individual product features for the customer's satisfaction and hence it creates the optimal requirement for process oriented product development activities. A pure marketing technique is conjoint analysis. Conjoint analysis estimates the relative importance of a product's attributes by analysing the consumer's overall judgment of a product or service. A more artistic method is called Semantic description of environments. It is mainly a tool for examining how a single person or a group of persons experience a certain (architectural) environment.\n\nAlthough all of these methods are concerned with subjective impact, none of them can translate this impact to design parameters sufficiently. This can, however, be accomplished by Kansei engineering. Kansei engineering (KE) has been used as a tool for affective engineering. It was developed in the early 70s in Japan and is now widely spread among Japanese companies. In the middle of the 90s, the method spread to the United States, but cultural differences may have prevented the method to enfold its whole potential.\n\nAs mentioned above, Kansei engineering can be considered as a methodology within the research field of 'affective engineering'. Some researchers have identified the content of the methodology. Shimizu et al. state that 'Kansei Engineering is used as a tool for product development and the basic principles behind it are the following: identification of product properties and correlation between those properties and the design characteristics'.\n\nAccording to Nagasawa, one of the forerunners of Kansei engineering, there are three focal points in the method:\n\nIn Japanese publications, different types of Kansei engineering are identified and applied in various contexts. Schütte examined different types of Kansei engineering and developed a general model covering the contents of Kansei engineering.\n\n\"Domain\" in this context describes the overall idea behind an assembly of products, i.e. the product type in general. Choosing the domain includes the definition of the intended target group and user type, market-niche and type, and the product group in question. Choosing and defining the domain are carried out on existing products, concepts and on design solutions yet unknown. From this, a domain description is formulated, serving as the basis for further evaluation. The process is necessary and has been described by Schütte in detail in a couple of publications.\n\nThe expression \"Semantic Space\" was addressed for the first time by Osgood et al.. He posed that every artifact can be described in a certain vector space defined by semantic expressions (words). This is done by collecting a large number of words that describe the domain. Suitable sources are pertinent literature, commercials, manuals, specification list, experts etc. The number of the words gathered varies according to the product, typically between 100 and 1000 words. In a second step the words are grouped using manual (e.g. Affinity diagram, compare: Bergman and Klefsjö, 1994) or mathematical methods (e.g. factor and/or cluster analysis, compare: Ishihara et al., 1998). Finally a few representing words are selected from this spanning the Semantic Space. These words are called \"Kansei words\" or \"Kansei Engineering words\".\n\nThe next step is to span the Space of Product Properties, which is similar to the Semantic Space. The Space of Product Properties collects products representing the domain, identifies key features and selects product properties for further evaluation.\nThe collection of products representing the domain is done from different sources such as existing products, customer suggestions, possible technical solutions and design concepts etc. The key features are found using specification lists for the products in question. To select properties for further evaluation, a Pareto-diagram (compare Bergman and Klefsjö, 1994) can assist the decision between important and less important features.\nSynthesis\nIn the synthesis step, the Semantic Space and the Space of Properties are linked together, as displayed in Figure 3. Compared to other methods in Affective Engineering, Kansei engineering is the only method that can establish and quantify connections between abstract feelings and technical specifications. For every Kansei word a number of product properties are found, affecting the Kansei word.\n\nThe research into constructing these links has been a core part of Nagamachi's work with Kansei engineering in the last few years. Nowadays, a number of different tools is available. Some of the most common tools are :\n\n\nAfter doing the necessary stages, the final step of validation remains. This is done in order to check if the prediction model is reliable and realistic. However, in case of prediction model failure, it is necessary to update the Space of Properties and the Semantic Space, and consequently refine the model.\nThe process of refinement is difficult due to the shortage of methods. This shows the need of new tools to be integrated. The existing tools can partially be found in the previously mentioned methods for the synthesis.\n\nKansei engineering has always been a statically and mathematically advanced methodology. Most types require good expert knowledge and a reasonable amount of experience to carry out the studies sufficiently. This has also been the major obstacle for a widespread application of Kansei engineering.\nIn order to facilitate application some software packages have been developed in the recent years, most of them in Japan. There are two different types of software packages available: User consoles and data collection and analysis tools. User consoles are software programs that calculate and propose a product design based on the users' subjective preferences (Kanseis). However, such software requires a database that quantifies the connections between Kanseis and the combination of product attributes. For building such databases, data collection and analysis tools can be used. This part of the paper demonstrates some of the tools. There are many more tools used in companies and universities, which might not be available to the public.\nUser consoles\n\nAs described above, Kansei data collection and analysis is often complex and connected with statistical analysis. Depending on which synthesis method is used, different computer software is used. Kansei Engineering Software (KESo) uses QT1 for linear analysis. The concept of Kansei Engineering Software (KESo) Linköping University in Sweden (www.kanseiengineering.net). The software generates online questionnaires for collection of Kansei raw-data\n\nAnother software package (Kn6) was developed at the Polytechnic University of Valencia in Spain.\n\nBoth software packages improve the collection and evalutation of Kansei data. In this way even users with no specialist competence in advanced statistics can use Kansei engineering.\n\n\n\n"}

He was the first to create interdisciplinary masters and doctoral programs in engineering management, with curricula built explicitly on concepts drawn from systems theory and cybernetics. He served as President for both the American Society for Cybernetics (1986–88) and the American Society for Engineering Management (1998–99) and was elected an Academician in the International Academy for Systems and Cybernetic Sciences in 2010.\n\nRichards was born in Ann Arbor, Michigan and grew up in Orono, Maine. He received his bachelor's degree in electrical engineering from the University of Maine (1968). While serving as a pilot in the U.S. Marine Corps, he earned master's degrees in aeronautical systems from the University of West Florida (1970) and business administration from Mississippi State University (1974). He received his Ph.D. in operations research from the Wharton School at the University of Pennsylvania (1980). Notable accomplishments included: Founding Chair of the Department of Engineering Management at Old Dominion University (1984–97); founding Executive Director of the Center for Commercial Space Infrastructure (1992–95), which subsequently morphed into the Virginia Space Flight Center and commercial spaceport on Wallops Island; Founding Dean of the School of Management and Aviation Science (1997-2004) at Bridgewater State University; inaugural Executive Vice Chancellor for Academic Affairs (2004–15) and Interim Chancellor (2012–13) at Indiana University East; and, Interim Vice Chancellor & Dean for the Indiana University – Purdue University Columbus campus (2015–16). He retired from Indiana University in 2016 as Professor Emeritus of Management and Informatics.\n\nRichards' contributions can be sorted into three areas: (1) his development of constraint theory as an approach to the formulation of policy and technology strategy; (2) his advancement of the concepts associated with cybernetics as representing a new and powerful way of thinking; and (3) his application of cybernetic ideas to the design of a participative-dialogic society.\n\nIn his book, \"Constraint Theory\", Richards proposed that, in addressing problems and issues in complex systems involving many participants, desires be treated as constraints rather than as goals or objectives (as they are in traditional operations research problem formulation). In research for NASA, he applied constraint theory to the development of an approach for formulating policy on the selection of new space transportation systems, given the extreme uncertainty in the technologies that will be available by the time a new system becomes operational.\n\nRichards recognized a unique potential in the cybernetic version of systems thinking for addressing complex behavioral and social phenomena. He focused on the ideas of hierarchy, purpose and belief to highlight differences between the process-oriented thinking of cybernetics and, for example, whole systems thinking, teleological or purposeful systems thinking, and ideological systems thinking. He proposed that: (1) cybernetics be treated as a way of thinking about ways of thinking (of which it – cybernetics – is one), making the way of thinking a choice; and, (2) the cybernetician be treated as a craftsperson in and with time, merging art, science and design.\n\nSince its inception in 1992, Richards was a guest at the School for Designing a Society in Urbana, Illinois. A premise of the school was that social change can be realized in a transformation from the current to a new society (a change of system), not only in improvements to the current society (changes in a system). Richards saw in the cybernetic concept of conversation a particular dialogic with special relevance to processes of design and participation; from this, he created an idea for a participative-dialogic society, a society without violence or at least one where violence is the alternative of last resort. This idea, he argued, would require a change of thinking.\n\nIn 2002, Richards was elected a Fellow of the American Society for Engineering Management (#33) and was awarded the Norbert Wiener Medal of the American Society for Cybernetics in 2007.\n\nRichards published over 100 books, monographs, journal/magazine articles, and conference papers. These represent a selection (see also the references):\n"}

In MBE, a single 3D model contains all the information typically found on in an entire set of engineering drawings, including geometry, topology, dimensions, tolerances, materials, finishes, and weld call-outs.\n\nMBE was originally championed by the aerospace and defense industries, with the automotive industry following. It has been adopted by many manufacturers around the world, in a wide range of industries. Significant benefits for manufacturers include reduced time to market and savings in production costs from improved tool design and fabrication, fewer overall assembly hours, less rework, streamlined development and better collaboration on engineering changes.\n\nThere are two prerequisites to implementing MBE: The first is the creation of annotated 3D models, known as a Model-based definitions (MBD). This requires the use of a CAD system capable of creating precise solid models, with product and manufacturing information (PMI), a form of 3D annotation which may include dimensions, GD&T, notes, surface finish, and material specifications. (The mechanical CAD systems used in aerospace, defense, and automotive industries generally have these capabilities.) The second prerequisite is transforming MBDs into a form where they can be used in downstream lifecycle activities. As a rule, CAD models are stored in proprietary data formats, so they must be translated to a suitable MBD-compatible standard format, such as 3D PDF, JT, STEP AP 242, or ANSI QIF\n\nThe core MBE tenet is that models are used to drive all aspects of the product lifecycle and that data is created once and reused by all downstream data consumers. Data reusability requires computer interpretability, where an MBD can be processed directly by downstream applications, and associativity of PMI to specific model features within the MBD.\n\nHistorically, engineering and manufacturing activities have relied on hardcopy and/or digital documents (including 2D drawings) to convey engineering data and drive manufacturing processes. These documents required interpretation by skilled practitioners, often leading to ambiguities and errors.\n\nIn the 1980s, improvements in 3D solid modeling made it possible for CAD systems to precisely represent the shape of most manufactured goods—however, even enthusiastic adopters of solid modeling technology continued to rely upon 2D drawings (often CAD generated) as the authority (or master) product representation. 3D models, even if geometrically accurate, lacked a method to represent dimensions, tolerances, and other annotative information required to drive manufacturing processes.\n\nIn the early-to-middle 2000s, the ASME Y14.41-2003 Digital Product Data Definition Practices and ISO 16792:2006 Technical product documentation -- Digital product definition data practices standards were released, providing support for PMI annotations in 3D CAD models, and introducing the concept of MBD (or, alternatively, digital product definition)\n\nThe model-based enterprise concept first appeared about 2005. Initially it was construed broadly, referring to the pervasive use of modeling and simulation technologies (of almost any type) throughout an enterprise. In the late 2000s, An active community advocating development of MBE grew, based on the collaborative efforts of the Office of the Secretary of Defense, Army Research Laboratory, Armament Research Development Engineering Center (ARDEC), Army ManTech, BAE Systems, NIST, and the NIST Manufacturing Extension Partnership (MEP). The \"MBE Team\" included industry participants such as General Dynamics, Pratt & Whitney Rocketdyne, Elysium, Adobe, EOS, ITI TranscenData, Vistagy, PTC, Dassault Systemes Delmia, Boeing, and BAE Systems.\n\nOver time, based on community feedback, MBE became more narrowly construed, referring to the use of MBD data to drive product lifecycle activities. In 2011, the MBE Team published these definitions:\n\n\nBy 2015, with improvements to ASME Y14.41 and ISO 16792, and the development of open CAD data exchange standards capable of adequately representing PMI, MBE started to become more widely adopted by manufacturers.\n"}

He transferred to the United States Air Force in 1947. After retiring from active duty in 1953, he became President and chief executive officer, and later chairman, of Huyck Corporation.\n\nOliver Garfield Haywood, Jr., was born in Highland Mills, New York on 29 November 1911. He entered the United States Military Academy at West Point on 1 July 1932, and graduated top of the class of 1936 on 12 June 1936. His class included Bruce Palmer, Jr., who graduated sixth. Haywood was commissioned as a second lieutenant in the United States Army Corps of Engineers, and was posted to Vicksburg, Mississippi, as executive officer of the Waterways Experiment Station. In June 1937, went to Conchas Dam in New Mexico as assistant to the District Engineer, Captain Hans Kramer. The dam was under construction at the time, and was a major undertaking.\n\nOn 25 September 1938, Haywood entered Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) as a student officer. While there he was promoted to first lieutenant on 12 June 1939. On 25 September 1939, he also became a graduate student at Harvard University's Graduate School of Engineering. He received his Master of Science (MS) degree from Harvard on 20 June 1940, and his Doctor of Science (DSc) degree from MIT on 15 August. He was promoted to captain on 15 September.\n\nHaywood assumed command of Company C, 27th Engineer Battalion in Puerto Rico on 13 September 1940. He then commanded the 130th Engineer Battalion there from 16 April 1941 until 31 December 1941. On 1 January 1942, he became executive officer of the 78th Engineers there. He was promoted to major in the wartime Army of the United States on 1 February 1942. He attended the Command and General Staff College at Fort Leavenworth, Kansas, from November 1942 to February 1943, before returning to Puerto Rico for duty on the staff of the Antilles Department. He was promoted to lieutenant colonel on 14 February 1943.\n\nIn October 1943, Haywood was assigned to the G-1 (Personnel) Division of the War Department General Staff in Washington, D.C. For his services in this role, he was promoted to colonel on 28 September 1944, and was awarded the Legion of Merit. On 5 August 1945, he became Assistant Chief of Staff (G-1) at headquarters, European Theater of Operations (ETO). For his services during the demobilization, he was awarded a second Legion of Merit.\n\nHaywood was transferred to the headquarters of the Manhattan Project on 12 April 1946. He was one of a number West Point graduates from the top ten percent of their classes who were transferred to the Manhattan Project at this time by the Secretary of War, Robert P. Patterson, at the request of the Manhattan Project's commander, Major General Leslie R. Groves, Jr., and over the objection of senior Army leaders. Their job was to replace reservists who had worked for the Project during the war and now were eligible for separation from the Army. Haywood participated in Operation \"Crossroads\", observing the nuclear tests at Bikini Atoll.\n\nGroves hoped that a new, permanent agency would soon be created to take over the responsibilities of the wartime Manhattan Project, but passage of the Atomic Energy Act of 1946 through Congress took much longer than expected, and involved considerable debate about the proper role of the military with respect to the development, production and control of nuclear weapons. The act that was finally signed by President Harry S. Truman on 1 August 1946 created a civilian agency, the Atomic Energy Commission (AEC), to take over the functions and assets of the Manhattan Project, but the AEC did not assume its role until 1 January 1947. At this point, Haywood was seconded to the AEC's Directorate of Research.\n\nAlthough he had been a colonel in the Army of the United States, Haywood only held the substantive rank of captain in the Army Corps of Engineers. His Army of the United States rank was terminated on 30 June 1947, and he returned to duty with the War Department General Staff as a captain on 1 July 1947. Haywood elected to transfer to the newly created United States Air Force on 10 December 1947. He became a lieutenant colonel on 1 July 1948, and was assigned to the Air Plans Division on 29 August 1948. where he was involved in drawing up nuclear war plans. From July 1949 to May 1950 he attended the Air War College at Maxwell Air Force Base, Alabama.\n\nHaywood was seconded to the Los Alamos National Laboratory in New Mexico from February 1950 to October 1951, at a time when the first thermonuclear weapons were being developed. Edward Teller once remarked that \"Colonel Haywood is the only military man I would work for.\" Haywood then served at the chief of the Air Force Office of Scientific Research, and was vice commander of the Atlantic Missile Range until his retirement from active duty in 1953. He remained with the Air Force Reserve, retiring with the rank of brigadier general in 1967.\n\nAfter leaving the Air Force, Haywood became the President and chief executive officer, and later the chairman of the board of Huyck Corporation in Stamford, Connecticut. He was also chairman and acting president of the Hudson Institute in Indianapolis.\n\nHaywood died in Vero Beach, Florida, on 25 May 2002. He was survived by his daughters, Barbara and Betty, and sons, Richard and Robert. His wife, Helen, had predeceased him.\n"}

It is written for members of the lay public who want to learn more about nuclear power, environmentalists concerned about global warming due to fossil fuel combustion; and scientists and others who work in the nuclear world. \n\nIn the book, Cravens, a skeptic about nuclear energy who actively protested the plan to open Shoreham Nuclear Power Plant on Long Island, New York, has a conversation about nuclear power while visiting friends in Albuquerque. One of them, Dr. Richard (Rip) Anderson, a scientist at Sandia National Laboratories, listens to her beliefs about how deadly nuclear plants are and gently suggests that she is not quite correct by describing how nuclear power actually works. After more discussions, Anderson suggests that accompanies him and his wife on a tour of the United States visiting power plants, national laboratories and the Yucca Mountain nuclear waste repository.\n\nCravens, after interviewing leading researchers, engineers, and experts in the fields of nuclear fission and radiation, public health, counterterrorism, and risk assessment, concludes that nuclear power is clean and safe. Exploration of the issues from multiple points of view and her own observations reveal to her that nuclear fission as a power source is being economically and cleanly harnessed in the U.S. She finds that in countries like France and Sweden, which both derive considerable energy from nuclear plants, the environment is far safer and cleaner than in those nations that continue to get most of their electricity from burning fossil fuels. She learns that in the worldwide energy industry - including wind and solar - nuclear power has by far the fewest deaths per terawatt-hour generated. She concludes that if we are to care for subsequent generations, embracing nuclear energy is an ethical imperative.\n"}
{"id": "1469133", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1469133", "title": "Preferred number", "text": "Preferred number\n\nIn industrial design, preferred numbers (also called preferred values or preferred series) are standard guidelines for choosing exact product dimensions within a given set of constraints. \nProduct developers must choose numerous lengths, distances, diameters, volumes, and other characteristic quantities. While all of these choices are constrained by considerations of functionality, usability, compatibility, safety or cost, there usually remains considerable leeway in the \"exact\" choice for many dimensions.\n\nPreferred numbers serve two purposes:\n\nPreferred numbers represent preferences of simple numbers (such as 1, 2, and 5) multiplied by the powers of a convenient basis, usually 10.\n\nIn 1870 Charles Renard proposed a set of preferred numbers. His system was adopted in 1952 as international standard ISO 3. Renard's system divides the interval from 1 to 10 into 5, 10, 20, or 40 steps, leading to the R5, R10, R20 and R40 scales, respectively. The factor between two consecutive numbers in a Renard series is approximately constant (before rounding), namely the 5th, 10th, 20th, or 40th root of 10 (approximately 1.58, 1.26, 1.12, and 1.06, respectively), which leads to a geometric sequence. This way, the maximum relative error is minimized if an arbitrary number is replaced by the nearest Renard number multiplied by the appropriate power of 10.\n\nIn applications for which the R5 series provides a too fine graduation, the 1–2–5 series\nis sometimes used as a cruder alternative. It is effectively an R3 series rounded to one significant digit:\n\nThis series covers a decade (1:10 ratio) in three steps. Adjacent values differ by factors 2 or 2.5. Unlike the Renard series, the 1–2–5 series has not been formally adopted as an international standard. However, the Renard series R10 can be used to extend the 1–2–5 series to a finer graduation.\n\nThis series is used to define the scales for graphs and for instruments that display in a two-dimensional form with a graticule, such as oscilloscopes.\n\nThe denominations of most modern currencies, notably the euro and British pound, follow a 1–2–5 series. The United States and Canada follow the approximate 1–2–5 series 1, 5, 10, 25, 50, 100 (cents), $1, $2, $5, $10, $20, $50, $100. The ––1 series (… 0.1 0.25 0.5 1 2.5 5 10 …) is also used by currencies derived from the former Dutch gulden (Aruban florin, Netherlands Antillean gulden, Surinamese dollar), some Middle Eastern currencies (Iraqi and Jordanian dinars, Lebanese pound, Syrian pound), and the Seychellois rupee. However, newer notes introduced in Lebanon and Syria due to inflation follow the standard 1–2–5 series instead.\n\nIn the 1970s the National Bureau of Standards (NBS) defined a set of convenient numbers to ease metrication in the United States. This system of metric values was described as 1–2–5 series in reverse, with assigned preferences for those numbers which are multiples of 5, 2, and 1 (plus their powers of 10), excluding linear dimensions above 100 mm.\n\nThe E-series is another system of preferred numbers. It consists of the E3, E6, E12, E24, E48, E96 and E192 series. Based on some of the existing manufacturing conventions, the International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC) began work on a new international standard in 1948. The first version of this IEC 63 (renamed into IEC 60063 in 2007) was released in 1952.\n\nIt works similarly to the Renard series, except that it subdivides the interval from 1 to 10 into 3, 6, 12, 24, 48, 96 or 192 steps. These subdivisions ensure that when some arbitrary value is replaced with the nearest preferred number, the maximum relative error will be on the order of 40%, 20%, 10%, 5%, etc.\n\nUse of the E-series is mostly restricted to electronic parts like resistors, capacitors, inductors and Zener diodes. Commonly produced dimensions for other types of electrical components are either chosen from the Renard series instead or are defined in relevant product standards (for example wires).\n\nISO 266, Acoustics—Preferred frequencies, defines two different series of audio frequencies for use in acoustical measurements. Both series are referred to the standard reference frequency of 1000 Hz, and use the R10 Renard series from ISO 3, with one using powers of 10, and the other related to the definition of the octave as the frequency ratio 1:2.\n\nFor example, a set of nominal center frequencies for use in audio tests and audio test equipment is:\nWhen dimensioning computer components, the powers of two are frequently used as preferred numbers:\n\nWhere a finer grading is needed, additional preferred numbers are obtained by multiplying a power of two with a small odd integer:\n\nIn computer graphics, widths and heights of raster images are preferred to be multiples of 16, as many compression algorithms (JPEG, MPEG) divide \"color\" images into square blocks of that size. Black-and-white JPEG images are divided into 8×8 blocks. Screen resolutions often follow the same principle. \nPreferred aspect ratios have also an important influence here, e.g., 2:1, 3:2, 4:3, 5:3, \n\nStandard metric paper sizes use the square root of two () as factors between neighbouring dimensions rounded to the nearest mm (Lichtenberg series, ISO 216). An A4 sheet for example has an aspect ratio very close to and an area very close to 1/16 square metre. An A5 is almost exactly half an A4, and has the same aspect ratio. The factor also appears between the standard pen thicknesses for technical drawings (0.13, 0.18, 0.25, 0.35, 0.50, 0.70, 1.00, 1.40, and 2.00 mm). This way, the right pen size is available to continue a drawing that has been magnified to a different standard paper size.\n\nIn photography, aperture, exposure, and film speed generally follow powers of 2:\n\nThe aperture size controls how much light enters the camera. It is measured in f-stops: , , , , etc. Full f-stops are a square root of 2 apart. Digital cameras often subdivide these into thirds, so each f-stop is a sixth root of 2, rounded to two significant digits: 1.0, 1.1, 1.2, 1.4, 1.6, 1.8, 2.0, 2.2, 2.5, 2.8, 3.2, 3.5, 4.0, etc.\n\nThe film speed is a measure of the film's sensitivity to light. It is expressed as ISO values such as \"ISO 100\". Measured film speeds are rounded to the nearest preferred number from a modified Renard series including 100, 125, 160, 200, 250, 320, 400, 500, 640, 800… This is the same as the R10′ rounded Renard series, except for the use of 6.4 instead of 6.3, and for having more aggressive rounding below ISO 16. Film marketed to amateurs, however, uses a restricted series including only powers of two multiples of ISO 100: 25, 50, 100, 200, 400, 800, 1600 and 3200. Some low-end cameras can only reliably read these values from DX encoded film cartridges because they lack the extra electrical contacts that would be needed to read the complete series. Some digital cameras extend this binary series to values like 12800, 25600, etc. instead of the modified Renard values 12500, 25000, etc.\n\nThe shutter speed controls how long the camera records light. These are expressed as fractions of a second, roughly but not exactly based on powers of 2: 1 second, , , , , , , , , , of a second.\n\n5:4, 8:5, 16:9.\n\nIn some countries, consumer-protection laws restrict the number of different prepackaged sizes in which certain products can be sold, in order to make it easier for consumers to compare prices.\n\nAn example of such a regulation is the European Union directive on the volume of certain prepackaged liquids (75/106/EEC). It restricts the list of allowed wine-bottle sizes to 0.1, 0.25 (), 0.375 (), 0.5 (), 0.75 (), 1, 1.5, 2, 3, and 5 litres. Similar lists exist for several other types of products. They vary and often deviate significantly from any geometric series in order to accommodate traditional sizes when feasible. Adjacent package sizes in these lists differ typically by factors or , in some cases even , , or some other ratio of two small integers.\n\n\n"}

The main characteristic of its design is its sensitivity. It is a popular and very effective method of bite indication both on still and running water. It is not used in game fishing (i.e. salmon, trout and sea trout) and is seldom, if ever, used when fishing for very large coarse fish (e.g. carp or pike). In essence, the angler watches the tip of the fishing rod to detect bites as opposed to, say, a float or an electronic bite alarm.\n\nThe quiver tip is an extension of the fishing rod. The rod is specially designed to take quiver tips; nowadays, they are often called leger or feeder rods. Very sensitive float rods can be used for quiver tip fishing, but normally fishermen have a specialist rod especially for the task. The eyed tip of approximately 1–2 ft in length is attached as an extension to the end of the rod by a put-in or screw-in method. The quiver tip itself is a means of improving bite detection in conjunction with the ledgering method of fishing, whereby a weight is attached to the line close to the hook to assist in casting.\n\nA variation of this method is the swim feeder, which is a small weighted container with small holes in which loose feed can be placed to attract fish to the area near the hook bait.\n\nOn still water fishing venues after casting, the rod should be placed in a rod rest at a 90 degree angle to the direction of the cast with the tip near to the water to reduce the effects of the wind vibration on the tip. On moving waters such as rivers the rod should be placed on a stand pointing towards the direction of the cast with the tip high in the air in order to reduce the impact of the water flow on the line. The line between the end of the tip and the weight/swim feeder should be tensioned so that a slight bend in the quiver tip exists.\n\nThe reason for this is to allow for the detection of two types of bite.\n\nThe first type of bite occurs when the fish takes the bait and moves away from the fisherman, causing the line to tighten and pull on the quiver tip. The second type of bite occurs when the fish takes the bait and moves towards the fisherman causing the line to slacken and the quiver tip to drop back/straighten.\n\nQuiver tips are, relative to the rods which hold them, inexpensive and found in all coarse fishing tackle shops. They can be bought in various test curves, which correspond to how stiff the tip is (often measured in ounces.) The lower the test curve, the less stiff the tip is (i.e. the less weight required to bend the tip.) The test curve of the tip should be carefully considered as it could drastically impact on the bite detection/playing of the fish and should relate to the type of fish targeted and weather conditions. \n\nAs a general rule, it is desirable to fish with the lightest tip possible; that means the tip with the lightest test curve. This is because the lighter and more flexible the tip, the more sensitive and accurate the bite detection it provides. \n\nOne of the basic skills in quiver tip fishing is selecting the correct weight of the tip to match the target fish, having regard to the type of water and the prevailing weather conditions. For example, if British roach are being targeted on a stillwater in flat calm conditions, a quiver tip of a test curve of no more than an ounce would be a good choice. Alternatively, fishing for a strong aggressive fish like the British barbel in a fast-flowing river would require a heavier tip, possibly of three ounces or more - a lighter tip would be permanently bent round by the flow of the water, eliminating bite detection, and playing a strong fish would probably break it completely.\n"}

For design purposes, the columns are separated into two categories: short columns and slender columns.\n\nThe strength of short columns is controlled by the strength of the material and the geometry of the cross section. Reinforcing rebar is placed axially in the column to provide additional axial stiffness. Accounting for the additional stiffness of the steel,hj the nominal loading capacity P for the column in terms of the maximum compressive stress of the concrete f', the yield stress of the steel f, the gross cross section area of the column A, and the total cross section area of the steel rebar A\nwhere the first term represents the load carried by the concrete and the second term represents the load carried by the steel. Because the yield strength of steel is an order of magnitude larger than that of concrete, a small addition of steel will greatly increase the strength of the column.\n\nTo give a conservative estimate and build redundancies into the final structural system, the ACI Building Code Requirements give a maximum reduced design load of formula_2 where formula_3 is the strength reduction factor for the type of column used. For spiral columns\nwhere formula_5. For tied columns\nwhere formula_7.\nThe additional reduction past the strength reduction factor is to account for any eccentricities in the loading of column. Distributing a load toward one end of the column will produce a moment in the column and prevent the entire cross section from carrying the load, thus producing high stress concentrations towards that end of the column.\n\nSpiral columns are cylindrical columns with a continuous helical bar wrapping around the column. The spiral acts to provide support in the transverse direction and prevent the column from barreling. The amount of reinforcement is required to provide additional load-carrying capacity greater than or equal to that attributed from the shell as to compensate for the strength lost when the shell spalls off. With further thickening of the spiral rebar, the axially loaded concrete becomes the weakest link in the system and the strength contribution from the additional rebar does not take effect until the column has failed axially. At that point, the additional strength from spiral reinforcement engages and prevents catastrophic failure, instead giving rise to a much slower ductile failure.\n\nThe ACI Building Code Requirements put the following restrictions on amount of spiral reinforcement.\nACI Code 7.10.4.2: For cast-in-place construction, size of spirals shall not be less than 3/8 in. diameter.\n\nACI Code 7.10.4.3: Clear spacing between spirals shall not exceed 3 in., nor be less than 1in.\nSection 10.9.3 adds an additional lower limit to the amount of spiral reinforcement via the volumetric spiral reinforcement ratio ρ.\n\nwhere A is the shell area, the cross-sectional area measured to the outside edges of transverse reinforcement.\nP = f/A\n\nTied columns have closed lateral ties spaced approximately uniformly across the column. The spacing of the ties is limited in that they must be close enough to prevent barreling failure between them, and far enough apart that they do not interfere with the setting of the concrete. The ACI codebook puts an upward limit on the spacing between ties.\nACI Code 7.10.5: Vertical spacing of ties shall not exceed 16 longitudinal bar diameters, 48 tie bar or wire diameters, or least dimension of the compression member.\nIf the ties are spaced too far apart, the column will experience shearfailure and barrel in between the ties.\n\nColumns qualify as being slender when their cross sectional area is very small in proportion to their length. Unlike Short Columns, Slender Columns are limited by their geometry and will buckle before the concrete or steel reinforcement yields.\n\nThere are some analytical stress-strain models and damage indices for confined and unconfined concretes to simulate reinforced concrete columns that make possible without any experimental test to evaluate the stress-strain relationship and damage of confined and unconfined concretes situated inside and outside of stirrups. To see such models and simulations of columns subjected to the cyclic and monotonic loading, refer to the following links:,\n"}
{"id": "56024352", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=56024352", "title": "Roof seamer", "text": "Roof seamer\n\nA roof seamer is a portable roll forming machine that is used to install mechanically seamed structural standing seam metal roof panels, as part of an overall metal construction building envelope system. The machine is small and portable to be handled by an operator on top of a roof. The machine is applied to the overlapping area when two parallel roof panels meet. The action of the machine bends the two panels together to form a joint that has weather-tight qualities superior to other types of roof systems and cladding.\n\nCommonly, a roof seamer is developed as an afterthought. Since roof seamers are dependent on the metal roof system being used, their development was secondary to the roof panel. A roof seamer is a development that replaced a manual process and hand tools of the past. A hammer and small anvil were tools that were used for hemming and seaming roof panels together at the edge where they meet with the next roof panel in sequence.\n\nIn 1976, a German immigrant and inventor, Ewald Stellrecht, helped develop an early version of a metal roof panel portable roll forming machine in Exton, PA. From this a version of the roof seamer was also created. Since that time, great strides and innovations have been made in the development of roof seaming machines. Also, in the 1970s, Butler Manufacturing developed and released a proprietary roof system that featured the use of an electric roof seamer, dubbed the Roof Runner®, along with hand tools and an operating platform. Many developments have been made since that time to make roof seamers lighter, faster, and more user-friendly. In 1989, Developmental Industries refocused the niche market by developing a line of roof seamers that were universal to many different panel manufacturers' products and were available to rent by the end-user. Traditionally, purchasing a roof seamer meant that it would work with one specific roof panel, manufactured by a specific roof panel manufacturer. By opening up builders and installers to the option of renting, this allowed them to have the option of buying from different sources and greatly reducing their cost, making metal roofing a more accessible option for many that would not consider it before.\n\nToday roof seamers are used around the world. As the rise in popularity in sustainable building products has risen in recent years, the need of a roof seaming tool has also increased. Most roof seaming machines can have a life expectancy of 20 or more years, if proper maintenance and care are exercised.\n\nMany variables exist when using a roof seamer that may affect the final product outcome. All of the following variables should be considered and decided on during the design process of the building:\n\nTraditionally, roof seamers are powered by electricity-driven motors. Depending on the operator's location, either 110-volt or 220-volt power may be required. On most construction sites, either temporary electrical power is supplied or power is offered by an electric generator. This gives the operator the flexibility to take the power source onto a roof with them instead of using extensions cords, which can depreciate the power supply and possibly damage the motor of the roof seamer.\n\nWhile simple in concept, the effective use of the roof seamer requires a trained person to operate. Training is both practical and effective in on-site troubleshooting. While classroom and practical training are options to learn how to operate a roof seamer, on-the-job training is recommended as being the most effective method. Manuals, videos, and field guides are also methods that will support training. In all cases, training should be completed before operating alone with a roof seamer to teach proper preventive maintenance steps, simple adjustments and troubleshooting in the event of a machine problem.\n\nIn 2015, the Metal Construction Association published a \"best practices\" guide for proper use and operation of roof seaming tools.\n\nAs with any tool, proper maintenance will increase the usefulness and life expectancy. Proper maintenance extends beyond the roof seamer, to the working surface on the roof. Before operating the roof seamer, ensure that the roof panel and seam are clean and clear of debris that could mark or gouge the forming dies. During operation check lubrication points and other recommended maintenance steps. In addition, most manufacturers will recommend scheduled service on an annual basis to ensure internal components are not worn or damaged.\n\nIn conjunction with the roof seaming machine, there are an array of hand tools that are used. The most common tool that is usually required when operating a roof seamer is a \"hand crimper\". The hand crimper is used to \"flat form\" the panel seams into the appropriate configuration to prepare the seam for the roof seamer to be applied. Other common tools are snips, nibblers, and shears.\n\nThere are numerous professional and trade organizations that support metal roofing, metal construction and the core market where roof seamers are used. The Metal Roofing Alliance (MRA), Metal Construction Association (MCA), Metal Buildings Manufacturers Association (MBMA), the Metal Buildings Contractors and Erectors Association (MBCEA), and the National Roofing Contractors Association (NRCA) are just a few. In addition, many distributors and suppliers offer resources and support documentation for their particular product offerings.\n"}

He started his career in Johannesburg and moved to London in 1968. Haskins is best known for his contribution to in-camera image montage, and his books, the most influential of which were \"Five Girls (book)\" (1962), \"Cowboy Kate\" (1964) and \"Haskins Posters\" (1973). He suffered a stroke on 19 September 2009, the opening day of his exhibition to launch 'Fashion Etcetera' at Milk Gallery in New York and died at home in Bowral, Australia, nine weeks later.\n\nHaskins was born in Kroonstad in the province of the Orange Free State of South Africa. His father Ben was a goods inspector on South African Railways. Early creative influences were fueled by an interest in magic tricks, kite making, drawing and the circus. A talented athlete, as a teenager he excelled at hurdling and trained with a circus, resulting in a job offer as a trapeze catcher.\n\nFormal higher education was at the Johannesburg Technical College 1945-1948, where he did a general arts course followed by a part-time photographic module. Between 1949 and 1951 he studied at the London School of Printing and Graphic Arts in Bolt Court, later renamed the London College of Printing and now the London College of Communication.\n\nHaskins married Alida Elzabe van Heerden in 1952 and they had two sons; Ludwig (4 August 1955) and Konrad (27 January 1963). They adopted a daughter, Heidi in 1960, but she died in infancy. Alida gave up a career in fashion soon after their marriage to become Haskins' business partner. She played a key role in the launch of his career by acting as a publishing agent for \"Five Girls\" when he was still an unknown photographer. She continued to negotiate worldwide publication of his books, apart from Fashion Etcetera, his last project, a book and exhibition in New York, managed by Ludwig. Alida died on 5 December 2012. Sam's artistic estate is now owned and managed by his son Ludwig. Konrad Haskins, Ludwig's younger brother and only sibling died on 23 March 2014.\n\nHaskins started his career as an advertising photographer in Johannesburg in 1953. He ran what was probably the first modern freelance advertising studio in Africa. He produced commercial work across a very broad spectrum of photography from still life to industrial, fashion and aerial. His first formal creative output was a one-man show at the popular Johannesburg department store John Orrs in 1960. This featured black-and-white photography of models in the studio and included some photographs of dolls made by the young Elisabeth Langsch, who went on to become Switzerland's leading ceramist.\n\nHis international reputation and his signature photographic passions were established by four key books published in the 1960s. \"Five Girls\" (1962) explored a fresh approach to photographing the nude female figure and contained important first explorations with black-and-white printing, cropping and book design, which were a key feature of his subsequent books. \"Cowboy Kate & Other Stories\" (1964) was probably the first book to deliberately explore black-and-white photographic grain as a medium for expression and image design. It was highly influential at the time, sold roughly a million copies worldwide and won the Prix Nadar in France in 1964. It continues to influence contemporary photographers, film makers, fashion designers and make-up artists. \"Cowboy Kate & Other Stories\" or 'Kate' as the book is often referred to, had its place in photographic history cemented in 2005 when the \"International Center of Photography\" in New York included the book in their exhibition \"The Open Book: A History of the Photographic Book from 1878 to the Present\".\n\n\"November Girl\" (1967) contained key image collages which formed the basis of many graphic and surrealist experiments in the 1970s and 1980s. \"African Image\" (1967) was a visual homage to the indigenous people, culture, landscape and wildlife of sub-Saharan Africa. The images represent a lifelong interest in photographing graphically stimulating environments and formally document his passion for indigenous craft. He broke bones on river rapids and wrote off two Volvo saloon cars on African dirt roads while shooting the book. Despite its international award, this meticulously constructed book, celebrating a love for sub-Saharan Africa, is probably the least known of his major creative projects, but it is coveted by serious collectors of African art and photography.\n\nIn 1968 Haskins moved to London and ran a studio in Glebe Place just off the King's Road. He worked as an advertising photographer for international consumer brands Asahi Pentax, Bacardi, Cutty Sark whisky, Honda, BMW, Haig whisky, DeBeers, British Airways, Unilever and Zanders, and specialised in the art direction and shooting of calendars, especially for Asahi Pentax in Japan. Although he endorsed Hasselblad for a short period in the late 1960s and early 1970s, his loyalty to the medium format 6x7 camera and lenses from Asahi resulted in a rare long-term association between a camera manufacturer and photographer. From 1970 to 2000, Asahi Optical (later Pentax) produced 30 calendars, of which Haskins shot and art-directed 15 editions including the millennium calendar. No other photographer was invited to contribute more than once. He is still involved with the Pentax Forum Gallery in Tokyo, which hosts his exhibitions. His first contact came in 1967 when Asahi Optical presented him with a 35 mm camera after hearing that he had shot \"African Image\" with various competitors' products.\n\nIn 1972 he produced his first colour book, \"Haskins Posters\". The large-format publication contained pages printed on one side using a thick stiff paper and a soft glue perfect binding allowing the pages to be removed and used as posters. Haskins and Alida successfully published the book internationally through their own company, Haskins Press. The book won a gold award at the New York One Show. At the time the best-known image from \"Haskins Posters,\" a girl's face superimposed on an apple with a bee near the stem, appeared on the cover or in editorials of almost every major photographic magazine around the world. This image was part of a well-publicised visual and graphic experimentation with the apple theme in the 1970s that for a while resulted in photographic journalists nicknaming him 'Sam the Apple man'.\n\nThe images in \"Haskins Posters\" traversed different creative themes that all became signature passions for Haskins' image-making over the next three decades; graphically strong compositions of nudes characterised by a natural essence in the models while the image-making explored themes of graphic experimentation, humour and sensual eroticism. Haskins has a recurring theme (rooted in his training as a painter) of creating tension in the surface of his photographs between flat graphic elements and 3D chiaroscuro. These results are often achieved with sophisticated lighting and/or double exposures. A highly creative and design driven approach to lighting almost always plays a key role in Haskins' work, both in the studio and on location. He often develops complex lighting designs for a single specific shot that are never repeated, the most recent example being a fashion shoot for \"New York\" magazine's 75th anniversary issue shot in New York's Pier 57 studios in August 2006.\n\nHe also often sculpted and painted graphic elements for his photographs and drew inspiration from a combination of surrealism, illustration, film and modern graphic designers.\n\nThe graphic experiments first seen in \"Haskins Posters\" and related exhibitions at London's Photographer's Gallery and National Theatre resulted in a book called \"Photo Graphics\" (1980). The title of the book coined a new term in photography that has since become widely used.\n\nHaskins' next book, \"Sam Haskins á Bologna\" (1984), resulted from an invitation by the mayor of Bologna to photograph the city. The publication was accompanied by an exhibition in the city. This project led to two more homages to visually rich locations shot over a series of visits; Barcelona (1991) and Kashmir (between 1992 and 1994).\n\nFrom 2000 to 2005, he focused on fashion photography for \"Vogue\", \"Harper's Bazaar\", \"Allure\" and \"New York\". A shortage of copies of the original edition of \"Cowboy Kate & Other Stories\" (1964), which was selling to collectors for up to US$3,000, led Haskins to bring out a digitally remastered 'director's cut' version in October 2006, published by Rizzoli in New York. Apart from image editing and layout revisions, the new version has 16 pages of new images. \n\nIn 2002 Haskins and Alida moved to the Southern Highlands in Australia and built the third house-studio of their partnership. The move away from London resulted in a renaissance in Haskins' fashion photography. While he always had a passion for fashion from the start of his career, and \"Cowboy Kate\" influenced fashion designers, who credited Haskins, he had not been courted by the mainstream fashion world and he did not court them. A shoot for [Yves Saint Laurent (designer)|Yves Saint Laurent] in Paris in 2002 resulted in a 'rediscovery' that led to a stream of assignments in London, New York, Paris, Tokyo and Sydney working for fashion houses and magazines.\n\nIn December 2006, a month after his 80th birthday, the first retrospective exhibition of his work (with a portraiture bias) opened at the National Portrait Gallery in Canberra (Australia). This was also his first exhibition at a national museum/gallery. The show ran for four and a half months to 22 April 2007. \n\nThe exhibition included several portraits of other artists never seen before, including one of the late Jean-Michel Folon, a graphic artist much admired by Haskins. Although one or two of the images from this personal portrait project had previously been published, the majority remained part of a quiet collection built up over decades of meeting and befriending other artists. \n\nIn 2009, Sam Haskins published, under the family imprint The Haskins Press, his first book in 24 years. \"Fashion Etcetera\" is a thematic slice through his archive that explores a lifelong passion for fashion, style and design. \"Fashion Etcetera\" was produced over three years working in close collaboration with his son Ludwig and his grandson Oren. The book is dedicated to Ludwig and Oren. In the last year of Haskins' life, 2009, his 'Fashion Etcetera' book and exhibition received widespread global publicity and in the process turned images of Gill from 'Five Girls' (1962) into one of the new found icons of the 1960s. Following the death of Sam's wife, Alida Haskins, on 5 December 2009, the Sam Haskins estate is now 100% owned and managed by Ludwig, who continues to publish and exhibit his father's work and negotiate image rights.\n\nHaskins is unusual among photographers for also being recognised as a designer. He has on various occasions given tribute to the following artists as being an influence on his work: photographers Irving Penn, Richard Avedon, Edward Steichen, Henri Cartier-Bresson and Jean-Loup Sieff; designers and typographers McKnight Kaufer, Paul Rand, Louis Dorfsman, Willy Fleckhaus, Alexey Brodovitch, Herb Lubalin, Milton Glaser, and Saul Bass; painters René Magritte, Surrealism, Dadaism, Impressionism, Post Impressionism, 20th century art from Paris, Pop Art; film makers Federico Fellini, Carol Reed (for his directing of \"The Third Man\"), Sergei Eisenstein (primarily for the directing of \"Strike\"). A list of Haskins' favourite photographers, drawn up in 2007, can be found on his blog.\n\nThe following are (with links to the author's web site) examples of signature images, all popular with magazine and book editors and published on multiple occasions.\n\nHaskins developed a medium format slide show comprising up to 500 images, each displayed for seven seconds, synchronised to music. These were shown with a traditional manual projector operated by Haskins using a darkroom timer. First shown in Brighton at an international photo conference in 1970, the show was hugely popular, filling theatres, cinemas and convention halls at photo conferences and public performances in over 50 cities around the world.\n\nThe initial format of the slides was 6cmx6cm as all Haskins' medium format images at that point had been shot on Hasselblad and Rolleiflex. Haskins took delivery of his first Pentax 6x7 in 1970 in Tokyo but it took several years to build up a body of 6x7 slides. The conversion of the slides to 6x7 format took place in 1975 and it was at this point that the show took on a much higher profile internationally.\n\nHaskins returned to his alma mater, The London College of Printing, in 1975 as outside assessor on the photographic diploma course, a position he maintained until 1982.\n\nBetween 1980 and 1985 he ran one-week workshops for writers, cinematographers, directors and set designers at Norwegian Television's training school in Oslo.\n\nHe ran one-week photographic training workshops in Italy, Sweden and South Africa in the 1970s.\n\nThe rest of his teaching was usually at one-day workshops at photo conferences and to groups visiting his studio. Haskins maintained close links with Syracuse University in the USA, hosting groups of visiting students at his studio in London every summer from 1975 to 1988.\n\n\nPrinted in offset litho as opposed to the original which was photo gravure printed in Switzerland.\n\n\n(1) \"The Art Director's Index\" is a paid entry publication but on this occasion the publishers requested editorial material from Sam.\n\n(1) \"Masters of the 20th Century\" is a book featuring graphic designers and typographers with the work of only two photographers, viewed in this context as photographic illustrators; Sam Haskins and Rankin Waddell.\n\n\n"}

If the environmental noise level as measured by the microphone exceeds a pre-set level for a certain amount of time (e.g. 5 seconds), the limiter’s circuitry will cut the power supply to the musical equipment and PA system for a brief amount of time.\n\nSound limiters are commonly installed at live music venues, including private venues and particularly those that host wedding receptions with live wedding bands.\n\nThe visual indicator on the limiter works most commonly on a “traffic light” system: green = no problem, amber = sound levels approaching the threshold, red = threshold breached. If the light stays red for more than a few seconds, then the limiter will take action and cut the power.\n\nAlthough there is no legal requirement to install a sound limiter, they are a reasonably inexpensive piece of equipment, which can help prevent complaints as part of a sound control plan and also protect the health of your staff by ensuring that the levels do not exceed those set by The Control of Noise at Work regulations 2005.\n"}

The Bluebelt includes structural and nonstructural stormwater management control measures taken to mitigate changes to both quantity and quality of runoff caused through changes to land use.\n\nThe Bluebelt program was initiated in the late 1980s by New York City’s Departments of Environmental Protection and Department of City Planning, based on a suggestion made several decades earlier by Ian McHarg, a landscape architect. Acquisition of land began in 1991 for the project, one of the Northeast United States’ most ambitious stormwater management efforts. The overall goal is to provide the necessary stormwater drainage infrastructure for a region on the southern end of the island while at the same time preserving the last great stand of freshwater wetlands in New York City. The bluebelt uses a series of carefully placed BMPs at the storm sewer/wetland interface to reduce flooding and improve water quality. Creation of a self-regulating ecosystem that is native to the Staten Island region is of primary importance to the program.\n\nBMPs used in the bluebelt include stormwater wetlands, stream restoration, outlet stilling basins, and sand filters. Ninety-two stormwater wetlands are planned for the project, about half of which have been constructed to date (2008). In order to integrate the wetlands into the natural ecology, the construction process is advised by restoration specialists since general contractors are typically not trained in proper plant selection and installation. The planting design focuses on quick establishment of the preferred successional communities that will complement the surrounding landscape, before invasive species take over the site.\n\nThe performance of the Bluebelt during the storms that battered Staten Island in the early 21st century – including Hurricane Sandy – has been described as \"brilliant\".\n\n\nNotes\nFurther reading\n\n"}

{"id": "3870820", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=3870820", "title": "Stuck fermentation", "text": "Stuck fermentation\n\nA stuck fermentation occurs in brewing beer or winemaking when the yeast become dormant before the fermentation has completed. Unlike an \"arrested fermentation\" where the winemaker intentionally stops fermentation (such as in the production of fortified wines), a stuck fermentation is an unintentional and unwanted occurrence that can lead to the wine being spoiled by bacteria and oxidation. There are several potential causes of a stuck fermentation-the most common are excessive temperatures killing off the yeast or a must deficient in the nitrogen food source needed for the yeast to thrive. Once the fermentation is stuck, it is very difficult to restart due to a chemical compound released by dying yeast cells that inhibit the future growth of yeast cells in the batch. At the winery winemakers take several steps to limit the possibility of a stuck fermentation occurring, such as adding nitrogen to the must in the form of diammonium phosphate or using cultured yeast with a high temperature and alcohol tolerance. These steps that winemakers may take to prevent a stuck fermentation will each have their own subtle or dramatic effect on the resulting flavors and quality of the wine.\n\nA chronic problem in winemaking is \"stuck fermentation,\" when yeast that should be busily converting grape sugar into alcohol and carbon dioxide prematurely shuts down, leaving the remaining sugar to instead be consumed by bacteria that can spoil the wine.\nA team of researchers including UC Davis yeast geneticist Linda Bisson has discovered a biochemical communication system behind this problem. Working through a prion -- an abnormally shaped protein that can reproduce itself -- the system enables bacteria in fermenting wine to switch yeast from sugar to other food sources without altering the yeast's DNA.\n\"The discovery of this process really gives us a clue to how stuck fermentations can be avoided,\" said Bisson, a professor in the Department of Viticulture and Enology. \"Our goal now is to find yeast strains that essentially ignore the signal initiated by the bacteria and do not form the prion, but instead power on through the fermentation.\"\nShe suggests that the discovery of this biochemical mechanism, reported Aug. 28 in the journal Cell, may also have implications for better understanding metabolic diseases, such as Type 2 diabetes, in humans.\nBacteria, yeast and fermentation\nBiologists have known for years that an ancient biological circuit, based in the membranes of yeast cells, blocks yeast from using other carbon sources when the sugar glucose is present.\nThis circuit, known as \"glucose repression,\" is especially strong in the yeast species Saccharomyces cerevisiae, enabling people to use that yeast for practical fermentation processes in winemaking, brewing and bread making, because it causes such efficient processing of sugar.\nPrions play key role\nIn this study, the researchers found that the glucose repression circuit is sometimes interrupted when bacteria jump-start the replication of the prions in membranes of yeast cells. The interference of the prions causes the yeast to process carbon sources other than glucose and become less effective in metabolizing sugar, dramatically slowing down the fermentation until it, in effect, becomes \"stuck.\"\n\"This type of prion-based inheritance is useful to organisms when they need to adapt to environmental conditions but not necessarily permanently,\" Bisson said. \"In this case, the heritable changes triggered by the prions enable the yeast to also change back to their initial mode of operation if environmental conditions should change again.\"\nThe researchers demonstrated in this study that the process leading to a stuck fermentation benefits both the bacteria and the yeast. As sugar metabolism slows down, conditions in the fermenting wine become more conducive to bacterial growth, and the yeast benefit by gaining the ability to metabolize not only glucose but also other carbon sources as well -- maintaining and extending their lifespan.\nSolutions for winemakers\nNow that this communication mechanism between the bacteria and yeast is more clearly understood, winemakers should be better able to avoid stuck fermentations.\n\"Winemakers may want to alter the levels of sulfur dioxide used when pressing or crushing the grapes, in order to knock out bacteria that can trigger the processes that we now know can lead to a stuck fermentation,\" Bisson said. \"They also can be careful about blending grapes from vineyards known to have certain bacterial strains or they could add yeast strains that have the ability to overpower these vineyard bacteria.\"\n\nThere are several potential instigators of a stuck fermentation. One of the most common found in winemaking is a nitrogen deficient must. Nitrogen is a vital nutrient in the growth and development of yeasts and is usually provided from the wine grapes themselves. Grapes grown in vineyards with soils lacking in nitrogen or grape varieties, such as Chardonnay and Riesling, which are naturally prone to have low nitrogen to sugar ratios will be at greater risk for having a stuck fermentation. Another cause rooted in the vineyard is from overripe grapes. Grapes that are overripe will have high levels of sugars that translates into higher alcohol content. Yeast are unable to reproduce in an environment with 16-18% ABV but in an environment with multiple stressors the fermentation could get stuck even before the alcohol level reaches that point.\nA byproduct of the energy created during fermentation is heat which raises the temperature of the fermenting must as the yeast work. When temperatures near 104°F (40°C), activity slows and yeast start to die. If temperatures stay high and the yeast stop reproducing then the fermentation is at grave risk of getting stuck. Even if the must is cooled back down, fermentation will be very difficult to restart due to a chemical compound released by the dying yeast that serves as an inhibitor to the growth of future yeast cells in the batch. Modern winemaking equipment includes temperature control mechanisms such as stainless steel fermenting tanks with a cooling jacket to help regulate temperatures. Another potential cause is a combination of lack of oxygen and yeast nutrients found in the lipids suspended in grape solids. In the absence of oxygen, yeast will seek out the lipids in grape solid as a source of nutrients to sustain its activity. If the wine is lacking grape solids (such as if the wine's been clarified) then the yeast are at risk of starving and causing the fermentation to get stuck. This risk is lower for red wines which are often fermented with their skins in open air containers or oak wine barrels which provide plenty of oxygen and grape solids for the yeast to feed on.\n\nThere are various techniques that a winemaker can employ to minimize the chances of a stuck fermentation happening. The most common is to use a cultured yeast strain with a high alcohol and high temperature tolerance coupled by diligent control of the fermentation temperature. Another technique is to add yeast nutrients like nitrogen to the must. The ammonium salt diammonium phosphate, or yeast nutrient, is a popular inexpensive means of ensuring the must has sufficient nitrogen. Whatever technique the winemaker uses, each has the potential to subtly or drastically affect the resulting flavor and quality of the wine.\n"}

Copyright protection secures a person's right to his or her first-to-invent claim of the \"original\" invention in question, highlighted in Article I, Section 8, Clause 8 of the United States Constitution which gives the following enumerated power to the United States Congress:\nIn 1641, the first patent in North America was issued to Samuel Winslow by the General Court of Massachusetts for a new method of making salt. On April 10, 1790, President George Washington signed the Patent Act of 1790 (1 Stat. 109) into law which proclaimed that patents were to be authorized for \"any useful art, manufacture, engine, machine, or device, or any improvement therein not before known or used.\" On July 31, 1790, Samuel Hopkins of Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, became the first person in the United States to file and to be granted a patent under the new U.S. patent statute. The Patent Act of 1836 (Ch. 357, 5 Stat. 117) further clarified United States patent law to the extent of establishing a patent office where patent applications are filed, processed, and granted, contingent upon the language and scope of the claimant's invention, for a patent term of 14 years with an extension of up to an additional 7 years.\n\nFrom 1836 to 2011, the United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) has granted a total of 7,861,317 patents relating to several well-known inventions appearing throughout the timeline below. Some examples of patented inventions between the years 1890 and 1945 include John Froelich's tractor (1892), Ransom Eli Olds' assembly line (1901), Willis Carrier's air-conditioning (1902), the Wright Brothers' airplane (1903), and Robert H. Goddard's liquid-fuel rocket (1926).\n\n1890 Stop sign\n\nA stop sign is a traffic sign, usually erected at road junctions such as a four-way intersection, that instructs drivers to stop and then to proceed only if the way ahead is clear. The idea of placing stop signs at road junctions was first conceived in 1890 when William Phelps Eno of Saugatuck, Connecticut proposed and devised the first set of traffic laws in an article published in \"Rider and Driver\". However, the first use of stop signs did not appear until 1915 when officials in Detroit, Michigan installed a stop sign with black letters on a white background. Throughout the years and with many alterations made to the stop sign, the current version with white block-lettering on a red background that is used in the United States as well as emulated in many other countries around the world today, did not come into use until the Joint Committee on Uniform Traffic Control Devices adopted the design in 1975.\n\n1890 Tabulating machine\n\nThe tabulating machine is an electrical device designed to assist in summarizing information and, later, accounting. The results of a tabulation are electrically coupled with a sorter while displayed on clock-like dials. The concept of automated data processing had been born. In 1890, Herman Hollerith invented the mechanical tabulating machine, a design used during the 1890 Census which stored and processed demographic and statistical information on punched cards.\n\n1890 Shredded wheat\n\n1890 Babcock test\n\n1890 Smoke detector\n\n1891 Ferris wheel\n\nA Ferris wheel is a non-building structure, consisting of an upright wheel with passenger gondolas attached to the rim. Opened on June 21, 1893 at the Chicago World's Fair, the original Ferris Wheel was invented two years earlier by the Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania bridge-builder George Washington Gale Ferris Jr. in 1891.\n\n1891 Dow process\n\nThe Dow process is the electrolytic method of bromine extraction from brine, and was Herbert Henry Dow's second revolutionary process for generating bromine commercially in 1891.\n\n1891 Tesla coil\n\nA Tesla coil is a type of resonant transformer circuit invented by Nikola Tesla around 1891. Nikola Tesla used these coils to conduct innovative experiments in electrical lighting, phosphorescence, x-ray generation, high frequency alternating current phenomena, electrotherapy, and the transmission of electrical energy without wires for point-to-point telecommunications, broadcasting, and the transmission of electrical power.\n\n1891 Rotary dial\n\n1891 Pastry fork\n\n1891 Schrader valve\n\nA Schrader valve consists of a hollow cylindrical metal tube, typically brass, with the exterior end threaded. The interior end takes a variety of forms depending on its application. In the center of the exterior end is a metal pin pointing along the axis of the tube; the pin's end is flush with the end of the valve body. Generally, all Schrader valves are used on tires. They have threads and bodies of a single standard size at the exterior end, so caps and tools generally are universal for the valves on all automobile and bicycle pneumatic tires. Also, pressure valves can be used on Schrader valves in place of caps in order to measure the pressure of pneumatic tires. In 1891, George Schrader, the son of German-American immigrant August Schrader, invented the Schrader valve. A patent was issued on April 11, 1893.\n\n1892 Bottle cap\n\n1892 Dimmer\n\n1892 Bicycle seat (padded)\n\n1892 internal combustion-powered tractor\nA tractor is a distinctive farm vehicle specifically designed to deliver a high tractive effort at slow speeds, for the purposes of hauling a trailer or machinery used in agriculture or construction. Agricultural implements may be towed behind or mounted on the tractor, and the tractor may also provide a source of power if the implement is mechanized. While steam powered tractors had been built earlier, In 1892, John Froelich invented and built the first gasoline-powered tractor in Clayton County, Iowa.\n\n1893 Zipper\n\nThe zipper is a popular device for temporarily joining two edges of fabric. Zippers are found on trousers, jeans, jackets, and luggage. Whitcomb L. Judson was an American mechanical engineer from Chicago who was the first to invent, conceive of the idea, and to construct a workable zipper. Using a hook-and-eye device, Judson intended for this earliest form of the zipper to be used on shoes. He also conceived the idea of the slide fastener mechanism in conjunction with the invention of the zipper. Patents were issued to Judson for the zipper in 1891, 1894, and 1905.\n\n1893 Spectroheliograph\n\nThe spectroheliograph is an instrument used in astronomy that captures a photographic image of the Sun at a single wavelength of light, a monochromatic image. The spectroheliograph was invented in 1893 by George Ellery Hale and independently later by Henri Alexandre Deslandres in 1894.\n\n1893 Pinking shears\n\nEarly 1890s Phantoscope\n\n1894 Stadimeter\n\nA stadimeter, a type of optical rangefinder, is an optical device for estimating the range to an object of known height by measuring the angle between the top and bottom of the object as observed at the device. It is similar to a sextant, in that the device is using mirrors to measure an angle between two objects but differs in that one dials in the height of the object. The stadimeter was invented in 1894 by Bradley Allen Fiske, a Rear-Admiral in the United States Navy. The first sea tests, conducted in 1895, showed that it was equally useful for fleet sailing and for navigation. Likewise, the stadimeter proved useful during the Battle of Manila Bay during the Spanish–American War. U.S. patent #523,721 was issued to Fiske on July 31, 1894.\n\n1894 Mousetrap\n\nA mousetrap is a specialized type of animal trap designed primarily to catch mice. However, it may also trap other small animals. Mousetraps are usually set in an indoor location where there is a suspected infestation of rodents. The first mouse trap was invented by William C. Hooker of Abingdon, Illinois, exactly three years before James Henry Atkinson developed a prototype called the \"Little Nipper\". Atkinson probably saw the Hooker trap in shops or in advertisements, and copyied it as the basis for his own model. Hooker received US patent #528671 for his invention, the mousetrap, in 1894.\n\n1894 Medical glove\n\nMedical gloves are disposable gloves used during medical examinations and procedures that help prevent contamination between caregivers and patients. Medical gloves are made of different polymers including latex, nitrile rubber, vinyl and neoprene; they come unpowdered, or powdered with cornstarch to lubricate the gloves, making them easier to put on the hands. In 1894, William Stewart Halsted, the Surgeon-in-Chief of Johns Hopkins Hospital, invented the medical glove in an effort to make medical care safer and more sterile for patients and health care workers.\n\n1895 Cyclocomputer\n\nA cyclocomputer or cyclometer is a device mounted on a bicycle that calculates and displays trip information, similar to the instruments in the dashboard of a car. The computer with display, or head unit, usually is attached to the handlebar for easy viewing. In 1895, Curtis Hussey Veeder invented the cyclometer.\n\n1895 Clipless pedal\n\n1895 Volleyball\n\nVolleyball is an Olympic sport in which two teams of 6 active players are separated by a net. Each team tries to score points against one another by grounding a ball on the other team's court under organized rules. William G. Morgan invented the sport first known as \"Mintonnette\" in 1895 while studying at a YMCA in Holyoke, Massachusetts. It was later renamed volleyball by Alfred S. Halstead.\n\n1897 Cotton candy\n\nCotton candy is a soft confection made from sugar that is heated and spun into slim threads that look like a mass of cotton. It was co-invented in 1897 by William Morrison and John C. Wharton, candy-makers from Nashville, Tennessee.\n\n1897 Muffler\n\nA muffler is a device for reducing the amount of noise emitted by a machine. On internal combustion engines, the engine exhaust blows out through the muffler. The internal combustion engine muffler was invented by Milton O. Reeves who received a patent in 1897.\n\n1897 Tapered roller bearing\n\n1897 Ice cream scoop\n\n1897 Charcoal briquette\n\n1897 Billiards cue chalk\n\n1898 Candy corn\n\nCandy corn is a confection in the United States and Canada, popular primarily in autumn around Halloween, that mimics the shape and coloration of corn kernels—a broad yellow end, a tapered orange center, and a pointed white tip. Candy corn is made primarily from sugar, corn syrup, artificial coloring and binders. It is generally thought that George Renninger, an employee of the Wunderlee Candy Company, invented candy corn in the 1880s. However, the earliest references credit the Goelitz Confectionery Company, now known as the Jelly Belly Candy Company, for introducing candy corn or \"chicken feed\" to the American public in 1898.\n\nA remote control is an electronic device used to operate any machine, such as a television, remotely. Many of these remotes communicate to their respective devices through infrared signals and radio control. In Madison Square Garden, at the Electrical Exhibition, Nikola Tesla gave the first demonstration of a boat propelling in water, controlled by his remote control which he designed using radio signals. Tesla received a patent for his invention in 1898.\n\n1898 Semi-automatic shotgun\n\n1898 Semi-truck \n\n1898 Filing cabinet (vertical)\n\n1898 Installer bit\n\n1898 Sousaphone\n\n1899 Wing warping\n\nWing warping consists of the twisting motion of the wings of an aircraft to produce lateral control. The entire wing structure twists slightly in a helical motion in the desired direction. The concept of wing warping is attributed to Wilbur Wright who in 1899, came up with the idea and with the conclusion that the roll of an aircraft could be controlled by the motion of that aircraft's wings. Exemplified by the twisting of a long, narrow box, the Wright brothers incorporated wing warping on their 1899 glider that used ropes to pull on the wings. Later on, the young French engineer Robert Esnault-Pelterie replaced wing warping in 1904 with the aileron on a copy he made of a 19th-century Wright glider. However, it was Henry Farman, a French aviator, who was the first to use the aileron as an integral part of the wing structure in place of wing warping in 1908.\n\n1899 Flash-lamp\n\nThe electric flash-lamp is a device that uses an electrical circuit to trigger a fuse to ignite explosive powder such as magnesium, for a brief sudden burst of bright light \"flash\" from a chemical reaction of flash powder burning. It was principally used for flash photography in the early 20th century, but had other uses as well. The flash-lamp was invented and patented on November 7, 1899 by New York City resident Joshua Lionel Cowen.\n\n1900 Duckpin bowling\n\nDuckpin bowling is a variation of bowling that uses balls which are significantly smaller than those used in ten-pin bowling, weighing each, which are devoid of finger holes. The pins are correspondingly shorter and lighter than their ten-pin equivalents. Hence, when the pins are knocked down, they resemble a \"flock of flying ducks\". While the rules remained almost identical to those of the Ten-pin game, one rule change was made: A bowler is allowed to use three bowls on each turn. Strikes would still be strikes and spares still spares, but when all pins were knocked down on the third ball, it counts as a score of ten. During the summer of 1900, some bowlers at Diamond Alleys in Baltimore, Maryland thought it might be interesting to resize the pins to match the 6-inch ball. Thus, the inventor of duckpin bowling, John Van Sant, used a wood turner to do exactly that.\n\n1900 Nickel-zinc battery\n\n1900 Merrill-Crowe process\n\n1900 Carbide lamp\n\n1900 Fly swatter\n\n1900 Thumbtack\n\n1901 Key punch\n\n1901 Mercury-vapor lamp\n\n1901 Assembly line\n\nUsed globally around the world, an assembly line is a manufacturing process in which interchangeable parts are added to a product in a sequential manner in order to create a finished product more quickly than with older methods. This type of manufacturing greatly reduces the amount of time taken to assemble a product, thus reducing production, material, and labor costs so that an affordable product cost can be passed onto consumers. According to a book entitled \"Michigan Yesterday & Today\" authored by Robert W. Domm, the assembly line and its basic concept is credited to Ransom Olds, who used it to build the first mass-produced automobile, the Oldsmobile Curved Dash. Olds patented the assembly line concept, which he put to work in his Olds Motor Vehicle Company factory in 1901. This development is often overshadowed by Henry Ford, who perfected the assembly line by installing driven conveyor belts that could produce a Model T in ninety-three minutes.\n\n1901 Safety razor (disposable)\n\nA safety razor protects the skin from all but the edge of the blade while shaving skin. King Camp Gillette, a traveling hardware salesman of Fond du Lac, Wisconsin invented the double-edged, disposable safety razor attached to a re-usable razor handle. Beforehand, dull razors were taken to barbers for sharpening. With Gillette's double-edged and disposable blades, a uniform shave on a man's face could be achieved with a fresh blade and disposed after it was used. Gillette applied for a patent in 1901. It was granted in 1904.\n\n1901 Windowed envelope\n\nA windowed envelope is a conventional envelope with a plastic window to allow the recipient's address to be printed on the paper contained within. Windowed envelopes save the expense of printing or labor of addressing, and in addition save time in preparing the message for dispatch when the customary addresses are already on the letter paper itself. Calling it the \"outlook envelope\", Americus F. Callahan of Chicago was the first to patent the windowed envelope. U.S. patent #701,839 was filed on December 9, 1901 and issued on June 10, 1902.\n\n1901 Radio direction finder\n\nA radio direction finder (RDF) is a device for finding the direction to a radio source. Due to radio's ability to travel very long distances and \"over the horizon\", it makes a particularly good navigation system for ships, small boats, and aircraft that might be some distance from their destination. The radio direction finder is the earliest form of radio navigation. It was first patented by American physicist John Stone Stone. He filed on January 23, 1901 and was granted the patent (U.S. Patent 716,134) on December 16, 1902.\n\n1902 Hearing aid\n\n1902 Postage meter\n\n1902 Teddy bear\n\n1902 Periscope (collapsible)\n\n1902 Mercury arc valve\n\n1902 Air conditioning\n\nAir conditioning is the cooling and de-humidification of indoor air for thermal comfort. Using a system of coils as a solution to cool and remove moisture from muggy air in a printing plant that was wrinkling magazine pages, Willis Carrier invented and manufactured the world's first mechanical air conditioning unit in 1902. Carrier's invention – encompassing the first system to provide man-made control over temperature, humidity, ventilation and air quality, was first installed as a solution to the quality problems experienced at a Brooklyn printing plant, Sackett-Wilhelms Lithographing and Publishing Company. Air conditioning not only spawned a company and an industry, but also brought about profound economic, social and cultural changes.\n\n1903 Tea bag\n\nA tea bag is a small, porous paper, silk or nylon sealed bag containing tea leaves for brewing tea. Tea bags were invented by Thomas Sullivan around 1903. The first tea bags were made from silk. Sullivan was a tea and coffee merchant in New York who began packaging tea samples in tiny silk bags, but many customers brewed the tea in them.\n\n1903 Offset printing press\n\n1903 Airplane\n\nA fixed-wing aircraft, or airplane, is a heavier-than-air craft whose lift is generated by air pressure differential between the upper and lower wing surfaces. The Wright brothers, Wilbur and Orville Wright of Dayton, Ohio, made the first powered and sustained airplane flights under control of the pilot in the Wright Flyer I on December 17, 1903 in Kitty Hawk, North Carolina. In the two years afterward, they developed their flying machine into the world's first practical fixed-wing aircraft. By October 1905, the Wright Flyer III was capable and proven to circle in the air 30 times in 39 minutes for a total distance of 24.5 miles. The brothers' fundamental breakthrough was their invention of \"three-axis control\", which enabled the pilot to steer the aircraft effectively and to maintain its equilibrium. This required method has become standard on all fixed-wing aircraft. From the beginning of their aeronautical work, the Wright brothers focused on unlocking the secrets of control to conquer \"the flying problem\", rather than on developing more powerful engines as some other experimenters did. Charles Edward Taylor built the first aircraft engine and was a vital contributor of mechanical aspects in the building and maintaining of early Wright engines and airplanes. Although there were many earlier attempts at heavier-than-air powered flight, some of which achieved successful short hops, and disputed earlier claims of sustained flight, the Wright brothers are officially credited by the Fédération Aéronautique Internationale, the international record-setting body for aeronautics and astronautics, as achieving \"the first sustained and controlled heavier-than-air powered flight\". In addition, U.S. patent number #821393 for the airplane, was filed by Orville Wright on March 23, 1903 and was issued in May 1906.\n\n1903 Windshield wipers\n\nThe windshield wiper is a bladed device used to wipe rain and dirt from a windshield. In 1903, Mary Anderson is credited with inventing the first operational windshield wiper. In Anderson's patent, she called her invention a window cleaning device for electric cars and other vehicles. Operated via a lever from inside a vehicle, her version of windshield wipers closely resembles the windshield wiper found on many early car models. Anderson had a model of her design manufactured. She then filed a patent (U.S. patent number 743,801) on June 18, 1903 that was issued to her by the U.S. Patent Office on November 10, 1903.\n\n1903 Wood's glass\n\nWood's glass is a light filter used in communications during World War I. An \"invisible radiation\" technique which worked both in infrared daylight communication and ultraviolet night communications, it does not transmit visible light, leaving the 'invisible radiation' as a signal beam. Wood's glass was invented by Robert Williams Wood in 1903.\n\n1903 Wood's lamp\n\nA Wood's lamp is a diagnostic tool used in dermatology which shines ultraviolet light onto the skin of the patient; a technician then observes any subsequent fluorescence. Though the technique for producing a source of ultraviolet light was devised by Robert Williams Wood in 1903 using \"Wood's glass\", not until 1925 was the technique used in dermatology by Margarot and Deveze for the detection of fungal infection of hair.\n1903 Baler (round)\n\nA baler is a piece of farm machinery used to compress a cut and raked crop (such as hay, straw, or silage) into compact bales that are easy to handle, transport and store. Several different types of balers are commonly used, each producing a different type of bales – rectangular or cylindrical (round), of various sizes, bound with twine, netting, or wire. The round hay baler was invented by Ummo F. Luebben of Sutton, Nebraska, which he conceived with his brother Melchior in 1903, and then patented in 1910. The invention of the round hay baler revolutionized the laborious task of haying into a one-man, low-cost operation with a machine that automatically gathered the hay, rolled into a round bale, and ejected it.\n\n1904 Automatic transmission\n\nAn automatic transmission is an automobile gearbox that changes gear ratios automatically as the vehicle moves, freeing the driver from having to shift gears manually. Modern automatic transmissions trace their origins to an early \"horseless carriage\" gearbox that was developed in 1904 by the Sturtevant brothers of Boston, Massachusetts.\n\n1904 Banana split\n\n1904 Pantograph (diamond-shaped)\n\n1904 Dragline excavator\n\n1905 Batting helmet\n\nA batting helmet is the protective headgear worn by batters in the game of baseball or softball. It is meant to protect the batter's head from errant pitches thrown by the pitcher. A batter who is \"hit by pitch\", due to an inadvertent wild pitch or a pitcher's purposeful attempt to hit him, may be seriously, even fatally, injured. In 1905, a New York Giants (the team now known as the San Francisco Giants) baseball player named Roger Bresnahan, after missing thirty days of the baseball season and lying in a hospital bed due to a head injury (or beaning), created, with assistance from the A.J. Reach Company, a crude, leather, vertically sliced football helmet over his cap that is considered to be the first batting helmet. The headgear was unpopular, even with Bresnahan at the time, and it wasn't until the mid-1950s that his idea was accepted.\n\n1905 Liquid ring pump\n\nA liquid ring pump is a rotating positive displacement pump that is powered by an induction motor and is typically used as a vacuum pump or as a gas compressor. The liquid ring pump was invented in 1905 by Lewis H. Nash. Production soon began thereafter at the Nash Engineering Company. Nash filed U.S. patent #1,091,529 on February 24, 1910 and was issued to him on March 31, 1914.\n\n1905 Ice pop\n\n1906 Typesetting\n\n1906 Flushometer\n\n1906 Audion tube\n\n1907 Curtain rod\n\n1907 Electrostatic precipitator\n\n1907 Paper towel\n\n1908 Candy apple\n\nCandy apples, also known as toffee apples outside of North America, are whole apples covered in a hard sugar candy coating. While the topping varies from place to place, they are almost always served with a wooden stick of sorts in the middle making them easier to eat. Toffee apples are a common treat at autumn festivals in Western culture in the Northern Hemisphere, such as Halloween and Guy Fawkes Night because these festivals fall in the wake of the annual apple harvest. Dipping fruits into a sugar syrup is an ancient tradition. However, the origin of the red candy apple is attributed to Newark, New Jersey candymaker who conceived the idea of dipping apples into a red cinnamon candy mixture he had on hand. In addition, dipping apples in hot caramel a 1950s American invention attributed to Kraft salesman Dan Walker.\n\n1909 Skee ball\n\nSkee ball is a common game found in arcades and one of the first redemption games. Skee ball is similar to bowling except it is played on an inclined lane and the player aims to get the ball to fall into a hole rather than knock down pins. The object of the game is to collect as many points as possible by rolling balls up an incline and into the designated point value holes. Skee ball was invented and patented in 1909 by J.D. Estes of Philadelphia.\n\n1909 Paper shredder\n\nPaper shredders are used to cut paper into chad, typically either strips or fine particles. Government organizations, businesses, and private individuals use shredders to destroy private, confidential, or otherwise sensitive documents. The first paper shredder is credited to prolific inventor Abbot Augustus Low of Horseshoe, New York. His patent for a \"waste paper receptacle\" to offer an improved method of disposing of waste paper received a U.S. patent on August 31, 1909.\n\n1909 Suppressor\n\n1909 Gin rummy\n\n1910 Headset\n\n1911 Fifth wheel coupling\n\n1911 Erector Set\n\n1911 Binder clip\n\nA binder clip, or a banker's clip or foldback clip, is a simple device for binding sheets of paper together. It leaves the paper intact and can be removed quickly and easily unlike the staple. The binder clip was invented in 1911 by Washington, D.C. resident Louis E. Baltzley who was motivated by a desire to help his father, Edwin, a prolific writer and inventor, keep manuscripts in order. The original design was modified five times, but the essential mechanism has never changed.\n\n1911 Automobile self starter\n\nAn automobile self-starter is an electric motor that initiates rotational motion in an internal combustion engine before it can power itself, therefore eliminating the hand crank used to start engines. In 1911, Charles F. Kettering invented the automobile self-starter while working at National Cash Register and then sold them for installation on cars at the Cadillac company. There had been many attempts at producing an electric starter before, but none of them were successful. Most designs at that time called for the use of an electric motor attached to the engine's flywheel. However, in order to fit in the car's engine compartment, the device would have to be small, and therefore it would be unable to produce a sufficient enough amount of torque.\n\n1911 Road surface marking\n\nA road surface marking is any kind of device or material that is used on a road surface in order to convey official information for drivers and pedestrians. Edward N. Hines originated the concept of painting a line down the center of a road to separate traffic in opposing directions. They were first used in Wayne County, Michigan in 1911.\n\n1912 Autopilot\n\nAn autopilot is a mechanical, electrical, or hydraulic system used to guide a vehicle without assistance from a human being. Most people understand an autopilot to refer specifically to aircraft, but self-steering gear for ships, boats, space craft, and missiles is sometimes also called \"autopilot\". The first aircraft autopilot was invented by Lawrence Sperry in 1912. Sperry demonstrated it in 1914, and proved the credibility of the invention by flying the aircraft with his hands away from the controls and visible to onlookers.\n\n1912 Electric blanket\n\nAn electric blanket is a blanket with an integrated electrical heating device usually placed above the top bed sheet. The first electric blanket was invented in 1912 by American physician Sidney I. Russell. This earliest form of an electric blanket was an 'underblanket' under the bed that covered and heated from below. In 1937, Electric 'overblankets which lie on top of the sleeping person were introduced in the United States.\n\n1912 Traffic light (electric)\n\nThe traffic light, also known as traffic signal, is a signaling device positioned at a road intersection, pedestrian crossing, or other location. Its purpose is to indicate, using a series of colors, the correct moment to stop, drive, ride or walk, using a universal color code. The color of the traffic lights representing stop and go are likely derived from those used to identify port (red) and starboard (green) in maritime rules governing right of way, where the vessel on the left must stop for the one crossing on the right. In Salt Lake City, Utah, policeman Lester Wire invented the first red-green electric traffic lights.\n\n1913 Formica (plastic)\n\nFormica is a hard durable plastic laminate used for countertops, cupboard doors, and other surfaces which are heat-resistant and easy to clean. Formica was invented in 1913 by Herbert A Faber and Daniel J. O'Connor of Westinghouse Electric.\n\n1914 Regenerative circuit\n\nThe regenerative circuit allows an electronic signal to be amplified many times by the same vacuum tube or other active component such as a field effect transistor. A regenerative circuit is often an AM detector, converting the RF signal on the antenna to an audio waveform. Their use of positive feedback greatly increases both the selectivity and sensitivity of a simple receiver. Positive feedback builds up the input signal to very high levels. Edwin Armstrong, invented and patented the regenerative circuit while he was a junior in college, in 1914.\n\n1914 Traffic cone\n\n1914 Fortune cookie\n\n1915 Skeet shooting\n\n1915 Single-sideband modulation\n\n1916 Hamburger bun\n\n1916 Lincoln Logs\n\n1916 Supermarket\n\nA supermarket is a self-service store offering a wide variety of food and household merchandise, organized into departments. It is larger in size and has a wider selection than a traditional grocery store. The concept of a \"self-service\" grocery store was invented by American entrepreneur Clarence Saunders and his Piggly Wiggly stores. Beforehand, customers would shop at a general store where a clerk behind a counter would fetch inventory in limited quantity for customers to purchase. With Saunders' new innovation of self-service, customers would be able to choose a wider selection of goods at competitive prices. Saunders' first store opened in Memphis, Tennessee, in 1916.\n\n1916 Cloverleaf interchange\n\nA cloverleaf interchange is a two-level interchange in which left turns, in countries that drive on the right, are handled by loop roads. To go left, in right-hand traffic, vehicles first pass either over or under the other road, then turn right onto a one-way three-fourths loop ramp (270°) and merge onto the intersecting road. The cloverleaf was first patented in the United States by Arthur Hale, a civil engineer in Maryland, on February 29, 1916.\n\n1916 Tow truck\n\n1916 Condenser microphone\n\n1916 Light switch (toggle)\n\nA toggle light switch is a switch, most commonly used to operate electric lights, permanently connected equipment, or electrical outlets whereby the switch handle does not control the contacts directly, but through an intermediate arrangement of internal springs and levers. The toggle light switch is safe, reliable, and durable, but produces a loud \"snap\" or \"click\" noise when a person's finger manually flips the toggle light switch into the on/off position. The design for the toggle light switch was patented in 1916 by William J. Newton and Morris Goldberg of Lynbrook, New York.\n\n1917 Stream cipher\n\nIn cryptography, a stream cipher is a symmetric key cipher where plaintext bits are combined with a pseudorandom cipher bit stream, typically by an exclusive-or (xor) operation. In a stream cipher the plaintext digits are encrypted one at a time, and the transformation of successive digits varies during the encryption. Also known as a state cipher, the stream cipher was invented in 1917 by Gilbert Sandford Vernam at Bell Labs.\n\n1917 Marshmallow creme\n\n1918 Superheterodyne receiver\n\n1918 French dip sandwich\n\n1918 Torque wrench\n\n1918 Crystal oscillator\n\n1918 Grocery bag\n\n1918 Hydraulic brake\n\n1919 Blender\n\n1919 Silica gel\n\n1919 Toaster (pop-up)\n\n1920 Eskimo Pie\n\n1920 Jungle gym\n\n1921 Polygraph\n\nNot to be confused with an earlier and different invention with the same name, a polygraph, popularly referred to as a lie detector, is an instrument that measures and records several physiological indices such as blood pressure, pulse, respiration, and skin conductivity while the subject is asked and answers a series of questions, in the belief that deceptive answers will produce physiological responses that can be differentiated from those associated with non-deceptive answers. The polygraph was invented in 1921 by John Augustus Larson, a medical student at the University of California at Berkeley and a police officer of the Berkeley Police Department in Berkeley, California. According to Encyclopædia Britannica, the polygraph was on its 2003 list of the 325 greatest inventions.\n\n1921 Flowchart\n\nA flowchart is common type of chart, representing an algorithm or process, showing the steps as boxes of various kinds, and their order by connecting these with arrows. Flowcharts are used in analyzing, designing, documenting or managing a process or program in various fields. The second structured method for documenting process flow, the \"flow process chart\", was invented by Frank Gilbreth to members of ASME in 1921 as the presentation \"Process Charts—First Steps in Finding the One Best Way\".\n\n1921 Adhesive bandage\n\nPopularly known by the brand name Band-Aid, an adhesive bandage is a self-sticking taped and small dressing used for injuries not serious enough to require a full-size bandage. This easy-to-use dressing with adhesive tape was invented by Earle Dickson in 1921.\n\n1921 Headrest\n\nIn an automobile, the headrest or head restraint is a device attached to the top of the seat behind the occupant's head. Most headrests are cushioned for comfort, are height adjustable and most commonly finished in the same material as the rest of the seat. The automobile headrest was invented by Benjamin Katz, a resident of Oakland, California, in 1921. U.S. patent #1,471,168 for the headrest was issued to Katz on October 16, 1923.\n\n1921 Garage door\n\nA garage door is a large door on a garage that can either be opened manually or by a garage door opener. Garage doors are necessarily large to allow passage of automobiles and/or trucks. In 1921, C. G. Johnson of Detroit, Michigan invented the \"Overhead Door\", the first upward-lifting garage door. To market the garage door, Johnson mounted a small prototype of his door on the back of his Model T Ford and drove around the United States signing up distributors.\n\n1922 Blowout preventer (ram)\n\nA ram blowout preventer is a large valve that can seal off a wellhead by using ram-types employing steel cut off rams to seal the borehole. During drilling or well interventions, the valve may be closed if overpressure from an underground zone causes formation fluids such as oil or natural gas to enter the wellbore and threaten the rig. In 1922, James Smither Abercrombie collaborated with Harry S. Cameron with the idea of creating a mechanically operated ram-type blowout preventer. A patent was issued in January 1926.\n\n1922 Convertible\n\n1922 Water skiing\n\nWater skiing is a sport where one or more persons is pulled behind a motor boat or a cable ski installation on a body of water wearing one or more skis. Water skiing began in 1922 when Ralph Samuelson used two boards as skis and a clothesline as a tow rope on Lake Pepin in Lake City, Minnesota. The sport remained a little-known activity for several years. Samuelson took stunts on the road, performing shows from Michigan to Florida. In 1966 the American Water Ski Association formally acknowledged Samuelson as the first on record. Samuelson was also the first ski racer, first to go over a jump ramp, first to slalom ski, and the first to put on a water ski show.\n\n1922 Radial arm saw\n\nA radial arm saw has a circular saw mounted on a sliding horizontal arm. In addition to making length cuts a radial arm saw may be configured with a dado blade to create cuts for dado, rabbet or half lap joints. Some radial arm saws allow the blade to be turned parallel to the back fence allowing a rip cut to be performed. In 1922, Raymond De Walt of Bridgeton, New Jersey invented the radial arm saw. A patent was applied for in 1923 and awarded to De Walt in 1925.\n\n1922 Audiometer\n\n1922 Neutrodyne\n\n1923 Bulldozer\n\nA bulldozer is a crawler or a continuous tracked tractor, equipped with a substantial metal plate or blade, used to push large quantities of soil, sand, or rubble during construction work. In 1923, a farmer named James Cummings and a draftsman named J. Earl McLeod co-invented and created the first designs. A replica is on display at the city park in Morrowville, Kansas where the two built the first bulldozer.\n\n1923 Cotton swab\n\nCotton swabs consist of a small wad of cotton wrapped around either one or both ends of a small rod. They are commonly used in a variety of applications including first aid, cosmetics application, for cleaning, and arts & crafts. The cotton swab was invented by Leo Gerstenzang in 1923, who invented the product after attaching wads of cotton to a toothpick. His product, which he named \"Baby Gays\", went on to become the most widely sold brand name, \"Q-tip\".\n\n1923 Instant camera\n\nAn instant camera is a type of camera with self-developing film. The earliest instant camera, which consisted of a camera and portable darkroom in a single compartment, was invented in 1923 by Samuel Shlafrock. In 1947, Edwin H. Land invented a new camera that produced photographic images in 60 seconds. A colored photograph model would follow in the 1960s and eventually receive more than 500 patents for Land's innovations in light and plastic technologies.\n\n1924 Locking pliers\n\n1924 Cheeseburger\n\nA cheeseburger is a hamburger with cheese added to it. Traditionally the cheese is placed on top of the patty, but the burger can include many variations in structure, ingredients, and composition. The term itself is a portmanteau of the words \"cheese\" and \"hamburger.\" The cheese is usually sliced, and then added to the cooking hamburger patty shortly before the patty finishes cooking which allows the cheese to melt. Lionel C. Sternberger is believed to have invented the \"cheese hamburger\" in the 1920s in the Northeast portion of Los Angeles County. The earliest year attributed to the invention of the cheeseburger by Sternberger is in 1924, while others claimed that he invented it as late as 1926. According to \"American Heritage\", \"a local restaurateur was identified as the inventor of the cheeseburger at his death in 1964. Cooking at his father's short-order joint in Pasadena in the early 1920s, the lad experimentally tossed a slice (variety unknown) on a hamburger 'and lo! the cheeseburger sizzled to life.\"\n\n1924 Earth inductor compass\n\nThe Earth inductor compass is a device for determining aircraft direction using the magnetic field of the Earth. The operation of the compass is based on the principle of electromagnetic induction with the Earth's magnetic field acting as the induction field for an electric generator. A variation generated voltage, thus allows the Earth inductor compass to determine direction. The earth inductor compass is an American invention. It was designed in 1924 by Morris Titterington at the Pioneer Instrument Company. Designed to compensate for the weaknesses of the magnetic compass, the Earth inductor compass provided pilots with a more stable and reliable reference instrument.\n\n1924 Gas chamber execution\n\n1924 Moviola\n\n1924 Radio altimeter\n\n1925 Automatic volume control\n\n1925 Masking tape\n\n1925 Reuben sandwich\n\n1926 Tilt-A-Whirl\n\n1926 Garage door opener\n\nA garage door opener is a motorized device that opens and closes a garage door. Most are controlled by switches on the garage wall, as well as by a remote control carried in the garage owner's vehicle. In 1926, the electric garage door opener was invented by C.G. Johnson, the inventor of the garage door and founder of the Overhead Door Corporation.\n\n1926 Power steering\nPower steering is a system for reducing the steering effort on vehicles by using an external power source to assist in turning the roadwheels. In 1926, Francis W. Davis of Waltham, Massachusetts invented power steering.\n\n1926 Drive through\nA drive-through, or drive-thru, allows customers to purchase products without leaving their cars. In 1926, City Center Bank, which became UMB Financial Corporation under R. Crosby Kemper opened what is considered the first drive-up window. In-n-Out Burger claims to have built the first drive-through restaurant in 1948. Harry and Esther Snyder, the chain's founders, built their first restaurant in Baldwin Park, California, with a two-way speaker to enable patrons to order directly from their cars without the intermediation of a carhop.\n\n1926 Liquid-fuel rocket\n\nThe liquid-fuel rocket is a rocket with an engine that uses propellants in liquid form. On March 16, 1926 in Auburn, Massachusetts, Dr. Robert H. Goddard, the \"father of modern rocketry\", launched the first liquid-fueled rocket in history, which used liquid oxygen and gasoline as propellants.\n\n1927 Bread slicer\nSliced bread is a loaf of bread which has been pre-sliced and packaged for commercial convenience. The automatic commercial bread slicer was invented in 1927 by Otto Frederick Rohwedder. His machine both sliced and wrapped a loaf of bread. In 1928, the bread slicer was improved by Gustav Papendick, a baker from St. Louis, Missouri.\n\n1927 Jukebox\nA jukebox is a partially automated music-playing device, usually a coin-operated machine, that can play specially selected songs from self-contained media. The traditional jukebox is rather large with a rounded top and has colored lighting on the front of the machine on its vertical sides. The classic jukebox has buttons with letters and numbers on them that, when combined, are used to indicate a specific song from a particular record. The Automatic Music Instrument Company built and introduced the first electric automated musical instrument which later became known as the jukebox during the 1930s.\n\n1927 Garbage disposal\nA garbage disposal is a device, usually electrically powered, installed under a kitchen sink between the sink's drain and the trap which shreds food waste into pieces small enough to pass through plumbing. The garbage disposal was invented in 1927 by John W. Hammes. After eleven years of development, his InSinkErator company put his disposer on the market in 1968.\n\n1927 Pressure washer\n\nA pressure washer is a high pressure mechanical sprayer that can be used to remove loose paint, mold, grime, dust, mud, and dirt from surfaces and objects such as buildings, vehicles, and concrete road surfaces. Frank Ofeldt in the United States invented the steam pressure washer or \"high-pressure Jenny\" in 1927.\n\n1927 Resonator guitar\nA resonator guitar or resophonic guitar is an acoustic guitar whose sound is produced by one or more spun metal cones resonators instead of the wooden sound board (guitar top/face). The resonator guitar was invented in 1927 by John Dopyera.\n\n1927 Kool-Aid\nKool-Aid is a powdered drink mix that comes in an assortment of different flavors. \"Kool-Ade\" was invented in 1927 by Edwin Perkins in Hastings, Nebraska. Perkins devised a method of removing the liquid from a drink called \"Fruit Smack\" so the remaining powder could be re-packaged in envelopes, which Perkins designed and printed, all under a new name to be called \"Kool-Ade\". The name of the powdered drink was later to be changed at a later time to Kool-Aid.\n\n1927 Corn dog\n\nThe corn dog, pogo, dagwood dog, pluto pup or corny dog is a hot dog coated in cornbread batter and deep fried in hot oil, although some are baked. Almost all corn dogs are served on wooden sticks, though some early versions were stickless. Although a contending topic as numerous claims of the origins of the corn dog have surfaced, the earliest reference to what resembles a corn dog appeared in U.S. patent 1,706,491 filed in 1927 by Stanley S. Jenkins and issued in 1929. A competing claim to the invention of the corn dog is by George Boyington, the creator of Pronto Pups (made of pancake batter) who in 1938 or 1939, created a \"batter-dipped, deep fried hot dog\" after a rain storm in Rockaway Beach, Oregon ruined and made his hot dogs mushy. Another story is that Neil Fletcher supposedly invented corn dogs, first selling them at the Texas State Fair in 1942.\n\n1927 Negative feedback amplifier\n\n1927 Quartz clock\n\n1928 Recliner\n\n1928 Ice cube tray\n\n1928 Bubble gum\n\n1928 Clip-on tie\n\n1928 Electric razor\n\n1928 Iron lung\n\n1929 Freon\n\n1929 Tampon (applicator)\n\n1929 Eyelash curler\n\n1929 Sunglasses\n\nSunglasses or sun glasses are a visual aid which feature lenses that are coloured or darkened to prevent strong light from reaching the eyes. For centuries, Chinese judges had routinely worn smoke-colored quartz lenses to conceal their eye expressions in court. However, these were not intended for blocking sunlight from eyes. It wasn't until the 20th century that what is now considered to be sunglasses were invented. In 1929, Sam Foster invented and mass-produced the first tinted eyewear pieces solely intended to block out sunlight.\n\n1929 Frozen food\n\nFrozen food is food preserved by the process of freezing. Freezing food is a common method of food preservation which slows both food decay and, by turning water to ice, makes it unavailable for most bacterial growth and slows down most chemical reactions. Clarence Birdseye offered his quick-frozen foods to the public. Birdseye got the idea during fur-trapping expeditions to Labrador in 1912 and 1916, where he saw the natives use freezing to preserve foods.\n\n1929 Cyclotron\n\n1930 Tiltrotor\n\nA tiltrotor is an aircraft which uses a pair or more of powered rotors (sometimes called \"proprotors\") mounted on rotating shafts or nacelles at the end of a fixed wing for lift and propulsion, and combines the vertical lift capability of a helicopter with the speed and range of a conventional fixed-wing aircraft. In September 1930, George Lehberger devised the basic concept of tilt rotor aircraft, that is, a relatively low disc loading thruster (propeller) that can tilt its axis from the vertical (for vertical lift) to the horizontal (for propulsive thrust). On September 16, 1930, Lehberger was issued U.S. patent #1,775,861.\n\n1930 Car audio\n\nCar audio/video (car AV) is a sound or video system fitted in an automobile. In 1930, the Galvin Corporation introduced the first commercial car radio, the Motorola model 5T71, which sold for between $110 and $130 and could be installed in most popular automobiles. Inventors Paul Galvin and Joe Galvin came up with the name Motorola when their company started manufacturing car radios.\n\n1930 Cheesesteak\n\nA cheesesteak, or a Philly cheesesteak, is a long, crusty roll filled with thinly sliced sautéed ribeye beef and melted cheese. Generally, the cheese of choice is Cheez Whiz, but American and provolone are common substitutions. The art of cheesesteak preparation lies in the balance of flavors, textures and what is often referred to as the \"drip\" factor. Other toppings may include fried onions, sautéed mushrooms, ketchup and hot or sweet peppers. The cheesesteak was invented in 1930 by Philadelphian hot dog vendor Pat Olivieri who one day decided to substitute beef instead of a hot dog in a hoagie bun. A taxicab driver noticed the alluring aroma and asked for his own sandwich. Through word of mouth, Olivieri's sandwiches the following day were highly sought after by taxi cab drivers around Philadelphia. Due to booming business, Olivieri soon opened up his own shop, Pat's King of Steaks on 9th Street and Passyunk Avenue. Eventually, according to legend, he added cheese to the steak. The cheesesteak is considered to be a cultural icon of the city of Philadelphia.\n\n1930 Bathysphere\n\n1930 Chocolate chip cookie\n\n1930 Thermistor\n\n1931 Electric guitar\n\nAn electric guitar is a guitar using pickups to convert its metal string vibration into electricity. This is amplified with an instrument amplifier. The output is altered with guitar effects such as reverb or distortion. The earliest electric guitar, known as a \"frying pan\", was a hollow bodied acoustic instrument with tungsten steel pickups invented by George Beauchamp and Adolph Rickenbacker in 1931. The electric guitar was a key instrument in the development of musical styles that emerged since the late 1940s, such as Chicago blues, early rock and roll, rockabilly, and 1960s blues rock. Electric guitars are used in almost every popular music genre. U.S. patent #2,089,171 was filed by Beauchamp on June 2, 1934 and issued on August 10 1937.\n\n1931 Strobe light\n\nThe strobe light, commonly called a strobe, is a device used to produce regular flashes of light. Modern uses of strobe lights serve a purpose for safety warning, and motion detection. Strobes can be found atop most police cars, ambulances, and fire trucks. The origin of strobe lighting dates to 1931, when Harold Eugene Edgerton invented a flashing lamp to make an improved stroboscope for the study of moving objects, eventually resulting in dramatic photographs of objects such as bullets in flight.\n\n1931 Aerogel\n\nAerogel is a low-density solid-state material derived from gel in which the liquid component of the gel has been replaced with gas. The result is an extremely low-density solid with several remarkable properties, most notably its effectiveness as a thermal insulator. It was first invented by Samuel Stephens Kistler in 1931, as a result of a bet with Charles Learned over who could replace the liquid inside of a Fruit preserves jar with gas without causing shrinkage.\n\n1931 Bug zapper\n\n1932 Miniature snap-action switch\n\n1932 Toilet brush\n\n1932 Golf cart\n\n1932 Staple remover\n\n1932 Radio telescope\n\nA radio telescope is a form of directional radio antenna used in radio astronomy. They differ from optical telescopes in that they operate in the radio frequency portion of the electromagnetic spectrum where they can detect and collect data on radio sources. Radio telescopes are typically large parabolic or dish antenna used singularly or in an array. Karl Guthe Jansky started the field of radio astronomy serendipitous in 1932 when his directional antenna found radio static that he later identified as coming from the Milky Way.\n\n1932 Tape dispenser\n\nA tape dispenser holds a roll of tape and has a mechanism on one end to easily shear the tape. Dispensers vary widely based on the tape they dispense. Clear tape dispensers are commonly made of plastic, and may be disposable. Other dispensers are stationary and may have sophisticated features to control tape usage and improve ergonomics. The first tape dispenser with a built-in cutting edge was invented in 1932 by John A. Borden, another 3M employee.\n\n1933 Landing Vehicle Tracked\n\nA Landing Vehicle Tracked (LVT), also known as amtracks, alligators, or in their fire support variants as buffaloes, were amphibious tracked vehicles capable of crawling out of the water and onto the beach and beyond. Used primarily by the United States Armed Forces in the Pacific War against the Empire of Japan during World War II, later versions were thinly armored, and some were equipped with a light tank turret to provide fire support, making them equivalent to light amphibious tanks. Highly versatile in their use, LVT's landed supplies ashore at Guadalcanal and soldiers ashore at Tarawa, other variations of the LVT were equipped with flamethrowers during the Peleliu Campaign. The LVT was derived from the \"Alligator\", an amphibious vehicle invented by Donald Roebling in 1933 as a rescue vehicle for downed aviators in the Florida Everglades.\n\n1933 Multiplane camera\n\nThe multiplane camera is a special motion picture camera used in the traditional animation process that moves a number of pieces of artwork past the camera at various speeds and at various distances from one another, creating a three-dimensional effect, although not stereoscopic. Various parts of the artwork layers are left transparent, to allow other layers to be seen behind them. The movements are calculated and photographed frame-by-frame, with the result being an illusion of depth by having several layers of artwork moving at different speeds. The further away from the camera, the slower the speed. The multiplane effect is sometimes referred to as a parallax process. As a former director and animator of Walt Disney Studios, Ub Iwerks in 1933 invented the multiplane camera using four layers of flat artwork before a horizontal camera.\n\n1933 Frequency modulation\n\n1933 Impact sprinkler\n\nAn impact sprinkler is a type of irrigation sprinkler that pivots on a bearing on top of its threaded attachment nut, and is driven in a circular motion by a spring-loaded arm that is pushed back by the water stream, then returning to \"impact\" the stream. This produces an intermittent diffusion of the stream that provides a uniform waterfall closer to the sprinkler. In 1933, the impact sprinkler was invented and patented by lemon tree grower and farmer Orton Englehardt of Glendora, California.\n\n1934 Trampoline (modern)\n\nA trampoline is a gymnastic and recreational device consisting of a piece of taut, strong fabric stretched over a steel frame using many coiled springs to provide a rebounding force which propels the jumper high into the air. In a trampoline, the fabric is not elastic itself; the elasticity is provided by the springs which connect it to the frame. While the trampoline is an old invention which relied on crude and flawed designs, the modern trampoline was invented by George Nissen and Larry Griswold around 1934.\n\n1934 Acrostic (puzzle)\n\nAn acrostic is a type of word puzzle, related somewhat to crossword puzzles, that uses an acrostic form with lettered clues and numbered blanks. The acrostic puzzle was invented in 1934 by Elizabeth Kingsley, first appearing in the March 31 edition of the \"Saturday Evening Post\".\n\n1935 Richter magnitude scale\n\n1935 Black light\n\n1935 Parking meter\n\n1935 Surfboard fin\n\n1935 pH meter\n\n1935 Gomco clamp\n\n1936 Reed switch\n\nA reed switch is an electrical switch consisting of two ferromagnetic and specially shaped contact blades (reeds) positioned in a hermetically sealed glass tube with a gap between them and in a protective atmosphere. Operated by an applied magnetic field, reed switches are used as reed relays, automotive sensors, robotics sensors, security sensors and are found in many toys and games. The reed switch was invented in 1936 by W. B. Elwood at Bell Telephone Laboratories.\n\n1936 Phillips-head screw\n\nThe Phillips-head screw is a crosshead screw design lying in its self-centering property, useful on automated production lines that use power screwdrivers. The Phillips-head screw was invented and patented by Henry F. Phillips in 1936.\n\n1936 Stock car racing\n\nStock car racing is a form of automobile racing. Shorter ovals are called short tracks, unpaved short tracks are called dirt tracks, and longer ovals are known as superspeedways. On March 8, 1936, the first stock car race was held on the Daytona Beach Road Course, promoted by local racer Sig Haugdahl. The race was 78 laps (250 miles) long for street-legal family sedans sanctioned by the American Automobile Association (AAA) for cars built in 1935 and 1936. The city posted a $5000 purse with $1700 for the winner. In 1948, stock car racing became a regulated sport when Bill France, Sr. created NASCAR.\n\n1936 Programming languages\n\nA programming language is a machine-readable artificial language. Programming languages can be used to create programs that specify the behavior of a machine, to express algorithms precisely, or as a mode of human communication. The first programming languages predate the modern computer. In mathematical logic and computer science, lambda calculus, also written as λ-calculus, is a formal system designed to investigate function definition, function application and recursion. It was invented by Alonzo Church and Stephen Cole Kleene in the 1930s as part of an investigation into the foundations of mathematics, but has now emerged as a useful tool in the investigation of problems in computability, recursion theory, and as a fundamental basis and a modern paradigm to computer programming and software languages.\n\n1936 Compact fluorescent lamp\n\nA compact fluorescent lamp is a fluorescent lamp designed to replace an incandescent lightbulb. Some CFL's fit into light fixtures formerly used for incandescent lamps and they are designed to produce the same amount of visible light found in incandescent light. CFLs generally use 70% less energy and have a longer rated life. In 1941, George Inman devised the first practical fluorescent lamp while working for General Electric. The key patent for this light source, U.S. patent #2,259,040 was filed by Inman on April 22, 1936 and issued to him on October 14, 1941. In 1976, Edward E. Hammer invented the first helical or spiraled compact fluorescent lamp, but due to the difficulty of the manufacturing process for coating the interior of the spiral glass tube, General Electric did not manufacture or sell the device. Other companies began manufacturing and selling the device in 1995.\n\n1936 Chair lift\n\nA chair lift is a type of aerial lift, which consists of a continuously circulating steel cable loop strung between two end terminals and usually over intermediate towers, carrying a series of chairs. They are the primary onhill transport at most ski areas, but are also found at amusement parks, various tourist attractions, and increasingly, in urban transport. James Curran, an engineer from the Union Pacific Railroad, invented and built the first chair lift in the world. Known as the Proctor Mountain Ski Lift, it was located in Sun Valley, Idaho.\n\n1936 Strain gauge\n\nA strain gauge is a device used to measure the strain of an object. As the object is deformed, the foil is deformed, causing its electrical resistance to change. The strain gauge was invented in 1936 by Edward E. Simmons, a professor at the California Institute of Technology, and re-invented in 1938 by Arthur C. Ruge, an earthquake specialist at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.\n\n1936 Bass guitar\n\nThe bass guitar is a stringed instrument played primarily with the fingers or thumb (either by plucking, slapping, popping, tapping, or thumping), or by using a plectrum. The bass guitar is similar in appearance and construction to an electric guitar, but with a longer neck and scale length, and four, five, or six strings. In 1936, the Audiovox bass, the earliest electric solidbody bass guitar made out of walnut and neck-through construction, was invented by Paul Tutmarc of Seattle, Washington. Later in 1951, the bass guitar was perfected when Leo Fender introduced the precision bass, a fretted, solidbody instrument.\n\n1937 O-ring\n\n1937 Photosensitive glass\n\n1937 Digital computer\n\n1937 Shopping cart\n\nA shopping cart is a metal or plastic basket on wheels supplied by a shop, especially a supermarket, for use by customers inside the shop for transport of merchandise to the check-out counter during shopping. Often, customers are allowed to leave the carts in the parking lot, and store personnel return the carts to the shop. The first shopping cart was invented by Sylvan Goldman in 1937, owner of the Humpty Dumpty supermarket chain in Oklahoma City.\n\n1937 Sunglasses (polarized)\n\nPolarized sunglasses are protective eyewear which incorporate oscillated lenses shifting the sun's rays in the opposite direction. Polarized sunglasses were invented in 1937 by Edwin Land.\n\n1937 Klystron\n\nA klystron is a specialized linear-beam vacuum tube. Klystrons are used as amplifiers at microwave and radio frequencies to produce both low-power reference signals for superheterodyne radar receivers and to produce high-power carrier waves for communications and the driving force for modern particle accelerator. Russell and Sigurd Varian of Stanford University are generally considered to be the inventors. Their prototype was completed in August 1937.\n\n1937 Cyclamate\n\n1938 Beach ball\n\nA beach ball is an inflatable ball for beach and water games. Their large size and light weight take little effort to propel; they travel very slowly and generally must be caught with two hands, making them ideal for lazy games and for children. Their lightness and size make them difficult to use in even moderate wind. The beach ball was invented in California by Jonathon DeLonge in 1938.\n\n1938 Fiberglass\n\nThe technique of heating and drawing glass into fine fibers has been used for millennia. The use of these fibers for textile applications is more recent. The first commercial production of fiberglass was in 1936. In 1938, fiberglass was invented by Russell Games Slayter of Owens-Corning.\n\n1938 Xerography\n\nXerography, which means \"dry writing\" in Greek, is a process of making copies. Xerography makes copies without using ink. In this process, static electricity charges a lighted plate; a plastic powder is applied to the areas of the page to remain white. The photocopier was invented in 1938 by Chester Floyd Carlson who marketed his revolutionary device to about 20 companies before he could interest any. The Haloid Company, later called the Xerox Corporation, marketed it, and xerography eventually became common and inexpensive.\n\n1938 Nylon\n\n1938 Operant conditioning chamber\n\n1938 Soft serve ice cream\n\nNot to be confused with regular ice cream of the slow, churned type which was invented in China over two millennia ago, soft serve is a distinctive type of frozen dessert that is similar to, but much softer than, ice cream. In 1938, J.F. \"Grandpa\" McCullough and his son Alex co-invented soft serve ice cream, devising a new way to serve ice cream in its soft, creamy form that it takes before going into the deep freeze to make it scoopable. After Alex McCullough commissioned Harry Oltz in 1939 to design the first soft serve ice cream machine, similar to ones used for making frozen custard, the Dairy Queen franchise was founded when Sherb Noble opened the first store in 1940.\n\n1938 Teflon\n\nIn chemistry, polytetrafluoroethylene is a synthetic fluoropolymer which finds numerous applications. PTFE is best known by the DuPont brand name Teflon. PTFE was accidentally invented by Roy Plunkett of Kinetic Chemicals in 1938.\n\n1939 Yield sign\n\nIn road transport, a yield sign or give way sign indicates that a vehicle driver must prepare to stop if necessary to let a driver on another approach proceed. However, there is no need to stop if his way is clear. A driver who stops has yielded his right of way to another. The yield sign, but not the yield traffic rule itself, was invented in 1939 by Tulsa police officer Clinton Riggs.\n\n1939 VU meter\n\nA VU meter is often included in analog circuit, audio equipment to display a signal level in Volume Units. It is intentionally a \"slow\" measurement, averaging out peaks and troughs of short duration to reflect the perceived loudness of the material. It was originally invented in 1939 by the combined effort of Bell Labs and broadcasters CBS and NBC for measuring and standardizing the levels of telephone lines. The instrument used to measure VU is called the volume indicator (VI) instrument. Most users ignore this and call it a VU meter.\n\n1939 Starting gate\n\n1939 Twist tie\n\n1939 Automated teller machine\n\nAn automated teller machine (ATM) is a computerized telecommunications device that provides the clients of a financial institution with access to financial transactions in a public space without the need for a cashier, human clerk or bank teller. ATMs are known by various other names including automatic banking machine, cash machine, and various regional variants derived from trademarks on ATM systems held by particular banks. Financial transcationssuch as deposits, withdrawals, and transfers of accounts may be conducted at ATM's by inserting an ATM card. In 1939, Armenian-American inventor Luther George Simjian initially came up with the idea of creating a hole-in-the-wall machine that would allow customers to make financial transactions. The idea was met with a great deal of skepticism after Citicorp tested it. In later years and after Simjian filed 20 patents related to the device, the idea and the gradual usage of ATM's became more widespread around the world.\n\n1939 Vocoder\n\nA vocoder, a portmanteau of the words voice and encoder, is an analysis and synthesis system, mostly used for speech. In the encoder, the input is passed through a multiband filter, each band is passed through an envelope follower, and the control signals from the envelope followers are communicated to the decoder. The decoder applies these control signals to corresponding filters in the (re)synthesizer. Research physicist Homer Dudley invented the Vocoder at Bell Labs in 1939 which served the purpose of improving the voice-carrying capabilities of his employer's telephone lines.\n\n1940 Fluxgate magnetometer\n\n1941 Aerosol Bomb\n1941 Deodorant\n\n1941 Acrylic fiber\n\n1941 Electric guitar (solid body)\n\n1942 Bazooka\n\nA bazooka is a shoulder-fired, man-portable recoilless rocket anti-tank weapon that features a solid rocket motor for propulsion, allowing for high explosive (HE) and high-explosive anti-tank (HEAT) warheads to be delivered against armored vehicles, machine gun nests, and fortified bunkers at ranges beyond that of a standard thrown grenade or mine. The bazooka was co-invented in February 1942 by Edward Uhl, then a lieutenant in the United States Army, and Colonel Leslie Skinner.\n\n1943 Magnetic proximity fuze\n\nA magnetic proximity fuze is a type of proximity fuze that initiates a detonator in a piece of ordnance such as a land mine, naval mine, depth charge, or shell when the fuse's magnetic equilibrium is upset by a magnetic object such as a tank or a submarine. In 1943, Panayottis John Eliomarkakis of Philiadelphia filed U.S. patent #2,434,551 which was issued on January 13, 1948.\n\n1943 Modern Coal Burning Steam Locomotive\n\nThis invention was only primarily used with steam locomotives that had booster valves or superchargers to heat the fire even hotter to produce extra power. The coal used was semi-bituminous and bituminous coal only inside the steam locomotives. Sadly, this invention lasted until 1960 when Diesel's fully replaced American railroads.\n\n1943 Slinky\n\nA Slinky or \"Lazy Spring\" is a toy consisting of a helical spring that stretches and can bounce up and down. It can perform a number of tricks, including traveling down a flight of steps end-over-end as it stretches and re-forms itself with the aid of gravity and its own momentum. The Slinky was invented in 1943 by American engineer Richard T. James while working in his home laboratory to invent a set of springs that could be used to support sensitive instruments on board ships and stabilize them even in rough seas. When he once accidentally knocked one of his springs off a shelf, James saw that, rather than flopping in a heap onto the floor, the spring \"stepped\" in a series of arcs from the shelf, to a stack of books, to a tabletop, to the floor, where it re-coiled itself and stood upright. In 1945, the James first exhibited his new toy at the Gimbels, a department store located in Philadelphia. He sold 400 Slinkys in 90 minutes which was the start of a sensation that continues to this day.\n\nA microwave oven cooks or heats food by dielectric heating. Cooking food with microwaves was discovered by Percy Spencer on October 8, 1945, while building magnetrons for radar sets at Raytheon. Spencer was working on an active radar set when he noticed a strange sensation, and saw that a peanut candy bar he had in his pocket started to melt. Although he was not the first to notice this phenomenon, as the holder of 120 patents, Spencer was no stranger to discovery and experiment, and realized what was happening. The radar had melted his candy bar with microwaves. The first food to be deliberately cooked with microwaves was popcorn, and the second was an egg. In 1947, Raytheon under Percy Spencer demonstrated the world's first microwave oven built at the company which was called the \"Radarange\".\n\n1945 Cruise control\n\nCruise control automatically controls the rate of motion of a motor vehicle. The driver sets the speed and the system will take over the throttle of the car to maintain the same speed. Cruise control was invented in 1945 by a blind inventor and mechanical engineer named Ralph Teetor. His idea was born out of the frustration of riding in a car driven by his lawyer, who kept speeding up and slowing down as he talked. The first car with Teetor's system was the Chrysler Imperial in 1958. This system calculated ground speed based on driveshaft rotations and used a solenoid to vary throttle position as needed.\n\n1945 Block heater\n\nTimelines of United States inventions\nRelated topics\n\n"}

{"id": "844877", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=844877", "title": "Warranty", "text": "Warranty\n\nIn contract law, a warranty has various meanings but generally means a guarantee or promise which provides assurance by one party to the other party that specific facts or conditions are true or will happen. This factual guarantee may be enforced regardless of materialitywhich allows for a legal remedy if that promise is not true or followed.\n\nAlthough a warranty is in its simplest form an element of a contract, some warranties run with a product so that a manufacturer makes the warranty to a consumer with which the manufacturer has no direct contractual relationship.\n\nA warranty may be express or implied, depending on whether the warranty is explicitly provided (typically written) and the jurisdiction. Warranties may also state that a particular fact is true at one point in time or that the fact will continue into the future (a \"continuing warranty).\n\nWarranties provided in the sale of goods (tangible products) vary according to jurisdiction, but commonly new goods are sold with implied warranty that the goods are as advertised. Used products, however, may be sold \"as is\" with no warranties.\n\nIn the United States, various laws apply, including provisions in the Uniform Commercial Code which provide for implied warranties. However, these implied warranties were often limited by disclaimers. In 1975 the Magnuson–Moss Warranty Act was passed to strengthen warranties on consumer goods. Among other things, under the law implied warranties cannot be disclaimed if an express warranty is offered, and attorney fees may be recovered. In some states, statutory warranties are required on new home construction, and \"lemon laws\" apply to motor vehicles.\n\nImplied warranties are unwritten promises that arise from the nature of the transaction, and the inherent understanding by the buyer, rather than from the express representations of the seller. In the United States, Article 2 of the Uniform Commercial Code (which has been adopted with variations in each state) provides that the following two warranties are implied unless they are explicitly disclaimed (such as an \"as is\" statement):\n\n\nThe most common kind of warranty on goods is a warranty that the product is free from defects in materials and workmanship. This simply promises that the manufacturer properly constructed the product, out of proper materials. This implies that the product will perform as well as such products customarily do.\n\nIt is common for these to be limited warranties, limiting the time the buyer has to make a claim. For example, a typical 90-day warranty on a television gives the buyer 90 days from the date of purchase to claim that the television was improperly constructed. Should the television fail after 91 days of normal usage, which because televisions customarily last longer than 91 days means there was a defect in the materials or workmanship of the television, the buyer nonetheless may not collect on the warranty because it is too late to file a claim.\n\nTime-limited warranties are often confused with performance warranties. A 90-day performance warranty would promise that the television would work for 90 days, which is fundamentally different from promising that it was delivered free of defects and limiting the time the buyer has to prove otherwise.. But because the usual evidence that a product was delivered defective is that it later breaks, the effect is very similar.\n\nOne situation in which the effect of a time-limited warranty is different from the effect of a performance warranty is where the time limit exceeds a normal lifetime of the product. If a coat is designed to last two years, but has a 10-year limited warranty against defects in materials and workmanship, a buyer who wears the coat for 3 years and then finds it worn out would not be able to collect on the warranty. But it is different from a 2-year warranty because if the buyer starts wearing the coat 5 years after buying it, and finds it wears out a year later, the buyer would have a warranty claim in Year 6. On the other hand, a 10-year performance warranty would promise that the coat would last 10 years.\n\nIn the United States, the Magnuson–Moss Warranty Act of 1976 provides for enforcement of a satisfaction guarantee warranty. In these cases, the advertiser must refund the full purchase price regardless of the reason for dissatisfaction.\n\nA lifetime warranty is usually a warranty against defects in materials and workmanship that has no time limit to make a claim, rather than a warranty that the product will perform for the lifetime of the buyer. The actual time that product can be expected to perform is normally determined by the custom for products of its kind used the way the buyer uses it.\n\nIf a product has been discontinued and is no longer available, the warranty may last a limited period longer. For example:\n\n\nWarranties are violated when the promise is broken or the goods are not as expected. The seller may honor the warranty by making a refund or a replacement. The statute of limitations depends on the jurisdiction and contractual agreements. In the United States, the Uniform Commercial Code § 2-725 provides for a four-year time limit, which can be limited to one year by contract, starting from the date of delivery or if future performance is guaranteed from the date of discovery. Refusing to honor the warranty may be an unfair business practice. In the United States, breach of warranty lawsuits may be distinct from revocation of contract suits; in the case of the breach of warranty, the buyer's item is repaired or replaced while breach of contract involves returning the item to the seller.\n\nSome warranties require that repairs be undertaken by an authorized service provider. In such cases, service by non-authorized personnel or company may void (nullify) the warranty. However, according to the Magnuson-Moss Act (a U.S. Federal law that governs warranties, which was passed in 1975), if the warranty does not provide full or partial payment of labor (to repair the device or system), it is the owner's choice who will provide the labor, including the possibility of DIY (\"Do It Yourself\") repairs, in which case the device or system owner will pay zero dollars for labor, yet the company that provided the warranty must still provide all the parts needed for the repair at absolutely no charge to the owner.\n\nIf the defective product causes injury, this may be a cause of action for a product liability lawsuit (tort). Strict liability may be applied.\n\nIn addition to standard warranties on new items, third parties or manufacturers may sell extended warranties (also called service contracts). These extend the warranty for a further length of time. However, these warranties have terms and conditions which may not match the original terms and conditions. For example, these may not cover anything other than mechanical failure from normal usage. Exclusions may include commercial use, \"acts of God\", owner abuse, and malicious destruction. They may also exclude parts that normally wear out such as tires and lubrication on a vehicle.\n\nThese types of warranties are provided for various products, but automobiles and electronics are common examples. Warranties which are sold through retailers such as Best Buy may include significant commission for the retailer as a result of reverse competition. For instance, an auto warranty from a car dealership may be subcontracted and vehicle repairs may be at a lower rate which could compromise the quality of service. At the time of repair, out-of-pocket expenses may be charged for unexpected services provided outside of the warranty terms or uncovered parts.\n\nStatements of fact in a contract or in obtaining the contract are considered to be either warranties or representations. Traditionally, warranties are factual promises which are enforced through a contract legal action, regardless of materiality, intent, or reliance. Representations are traditionally precontractual statements which allow for a tort-based action if the misrepresentation is negligent or fraudulent. In U.S. law, the distinction between the two is somewhat unclear; warranties are viewed as primarily contract-based legal action while negligent or fraudulent misrepresentations are tort-based, but there is a confusing mix of case law in the United States. In modern English law, sellers often avoid using the term 'represents' in order to avoid claims under the Misrepresentation Act 1967, while in America 'warrants and represents' is relatively common. Some modern commentators suggest avoiding the words and substituting 'state' or 'agree', and some model forms do not use the words; however, others disagree.\n\nWritten warranties on new major appliances, such as refrigerators, kitchen stoves and dishwashers, usually cover the cost of parts and labor to repair defects in materials or workmanship which appear under normal home use.\n\nWarranties often cover defects up to a year after purchase or delivery. However some exclude new owners when a house or appliance is sold within the year (Frigidaire, LG, Samsung). Others do let warranties transfer to new buyers (Amana, General Electric, Whirlpool). Some manufacturers cover refrigerators' sealed parts (compressors, tubing, etc.) for five years (General Electric, Samsung, Whirlpool) or seven years (LG) or ten years (KitchenAid). \n\nWarranties on water heaters cover parts for 5 to 12 years in single family residences, one year otherwise. They do not cover new owners when a house or heater is sold; nor do they cover the original owner if the heater is moved to a second location.\n\nTank models from A. O. Smith do not allow heating elements to be replaced with lower (or higher) wattages, and do not cover renter-occupied single family. They end if the unit is flooded or ever uses desalinated or deionized water, such as municipal desalination plants or reverse osmosis filters.\nSmith's tank models for manufactured housing do not provide coverage if a whirlpool or hot tub is connected.\n\nTank water heater warranties exclude labor, liability for water damage, and shipping cost to return the old heater or parts. Tankless warranties do not exclude water damage; they cover labor for a year, and Ruud/Rheem covers return shipping on tankless models.\nSmith's tankless water heaters do not restrict coverage to a single family, and require professional installation.\n\nImplied warranties under US law could extend for longer periods. However, most states allow the written warranties to include clauses which limit these implied warranties to the same time period as the written warranty.\n\nNew car factory warranties commonly range from one year to five years and in some cases extend even 10 years, with typically a mileage limit as well. Car warranties can be extended by the manufacturer or other companies with a renewal fee.\n\nUsed car warranties are usually 3 months and 3,000 miles\n\nIn the United Kingdom, types of warranties have been classified as either an: \n\nIn the United Kingdom, the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA), which began to regulate insurance contracts in this context in 2005, determined that additional warranties sold by car dealerships are \"unlikely to be insurance\". Insurance warranties may offer greater protection to the consumer.\n\nA home warranty protects against the costs of home and appliance repair by offering home warranty coverage for houses, townhomes, condominiums, mobile homes, and new construction homes. When a problem occurs with a covered appliance or mechanical system such as an air conditioning unit or furnace, a service technician repairs or replaces it. The homeowner may have to pay for a service call fee and the home warranty company pays the balance for the repair or replacement of the covered item.\n\nWarranty data consists of claims data and supplementary data. Claims data are the data collected during the servicing of claims under warranty and supplementary data are additional data such as production and marketing data. This data can help determine product reliability and plan for future modifications.\n\n\n"}

For example, wet-milling plants can separate a 56-pound bushel of corn into more than 31 pounds of cornstarch (which in turn can be converted into corn syrups or corn ethanol), 15 pounds of corn gluten meal for use in animal feed, and nearly 2 pounds of corn oil.\n\n"}
{"id": "36025733", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=36025733", "title": "Zeobit", "text": "Zeobit\n\nZeobit LLC (stylized ZeoBIT) was a technology and software company formed in 2009 by CEO Slava Kolomiychuk and located in Sunnyvale, California. The company specialized in computer security software and internet security. As of December 2016, it is no longer in business.\n\nZeobit is best known for the bundled utility software MacKeeper. The software has received mixed reviews with reviewers being very divided as to the effectiveness of the product.\n\nZeobit LLC was incorporated in September 2009 in the US State of California by Slava Kolomiychuk. Zeobit has a management headquarters in Sunnyvale, California and partnership offices in Europe and Asia that house developers and the customer support. In March 2010 their first product, MacKeeper (for macOS) was released and in September 2010 PCKeeper (for Microsoft Windows) was released. \nOn May 13, 2010, the first beta version of MacKeeper, version 0.8, was released.\n\nOn October 4, 2010, PCKeeper (MacKeeper's equivalent for Windows PCs) (version 1.1.48) was released. \n\nOn October 26, 2010, Zeobit released MacKeeper 1.0.\n\nOn January 30, 2012, MacKeeper 2.0 was released with updates in security, data control, cleaning and optimization.\n\nIn 2014, a Pennsylvania woman filed a class action lawsuit against Zeobit LLC, claiming that the company's computer security program identifies problems that don't exist and generates false error messages to scare users into purchasing an upgrade. (see Holly Yencha, et al. v. Zeobit LLC, Case No. 2:13-cv-00578, in the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Pennsylvania.) According to the complaint filed in US District court, \"Once installed, MacKeeper prompts the user to conduct a diagnostic scan\", the MacKeeper class action lawsuit says. \"This scan purportedly detects errors that lead to the problems identified in Zeobit's marketing materials (i.e., performance issues, security and privacy threats)—problems that MacKeeper is supposedly designed to fix.\" However, the Zeobit class action lawsuit alleges that after the diagnostic scan is completed, MacKeeper reports that it identified thousands of issues that cause the computer to be in \"critical\" condition. While the trial version of MacKeeper purports to \"fix\" a limited number of the issues, customers are encouraged to purchase a full, registered version of the security software to fully repair the computer. Yencha alleges that neither the free trial nor the full versions of MacKeeper perform reliable diagnostic testing of the computer. \"Instead, Zeobit intentionally designed MacKeeper to invariably and ominously report that a user's Mac needs repair and is at-risk due to harmful (but fabricated) errors, privacy threats, and other computer problems, regardless of the computer's actual condition\", the class action lawsuit alleges. The Class Action was settled in 2015 with no admission of wrongdoing and customers were given refunds.\n\nMacKeeper is utility software for macOS that claims to provide tools for security, cleaning, optimization and data control. MacKeeper and Zeobit were the official sponsors of the MacWorld / iWorld expo in San Francisco, California in 2011 & 2012. It was acquired by Kromtech Alliance Corp in May 2013. \n\nMacKeeper is often criticized for unethical marketing tactics, including pop-up advertising and buying domain names similar to the names of other antivirus programs. Zeobit claims their affiliates were responsible for the advertising accused as unethical. MacKeeper is sometimes referred to as a potentially unwanted program and is detected by some antivirus programs.\n\nPCKeeper is a bundle of most important system utilities for performing different tasks on the PС, such as antivirus, data control and optimization tools, drive clean-up utilities and much more. According to Virus Bulletin, PCKeeper has scored 91.9% in RAP test and was listed as number 6 antivirus in the world. It was acquired by Kromtech Alliance Corp in May 2013.\n\nThe ZeoDisk project is a cloud storage solution that will also be integrated in to the existing Zeobit products.\n\nIn 2011 Zeobit partnered with Avira to integrate their virus database technology in MacKeeper and PCKeeper’s Internet Security features. This partnership allowed Zeobit to offer internet security options for the macOS, Windows, Linux, FreeBSD, OpenBSD, and Solaris computing platforms.\n\nZeobit was a member of the Better Business Bureau. It had an F rating, due to complaints about its advertising and the quality of its products.\n\nZeobit was a Microsoft Silver Certified developer.\n\nZeobit was an official OPSWAT partner.\n\n"}
