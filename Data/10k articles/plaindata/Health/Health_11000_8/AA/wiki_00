As such, it is one of the earliest anti-tobacco publications. \n\nIt is written in Early Modern English and refers to medical theories of the time (e.g. the four humours). In it, James blames Native Americans for bringing tobacco to Europe, complains about passive smoking, warns of dangers to the lungs, and decries tobacco's odour as \"hatefull to the nose.\"\n\nJames's dislike of tobacco led him in 1604 to authorize Thomas Sackville, 1st Earl of Dorset, to levy an excise tax and tariff of six shillings and eight pence per pound of tobacco imported, or £1 per three pounds, a large sum of money for the time.\n\nBecause of continued high demand for tobacco in England and negative effects on the economies of the American colonies, the king in 1624 instead created a royal monopoly for the crop. 150 years later, British utilitarian philosopher Jeremy Bentham would cite \"A Counterblaste to Tobacco\" as an example of antipathy run wild.\n\n"}
{"id": "35485769", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=35485769", "title": "Abortion Caravan", "text": "Abortion Caravan\n\nThe Abortion Caravan was a feminist protest movement formed in Canada in 1970 by members of the Vancouver Women's Caucus. It was created to oppose the 1969 amendments to the Criminal Code which restricted legal access to abortion. Members formed a caravan, emulating previous peripatetic protest movements, traveled from Vancouver to Ottawa and gathered support along the way. Hundreds of women across Canada engaged in protests at the Prime Minister's official residence, burning effigies and leaving a black coffin at the front door. These protests sparked wider debate and contributed to abortion laws being struck down in 1988.\n\nIn February 1970, members of the Vancouver Women's Caucus (VWC) (1968–1971) gathered to begin planning the Abortion Caravan, Canada's first national feminist protest. Many members of VWC were part of New Left organizations and were either students or worked on university campuses. The Abortion Caravan was an opposition to the 1969 amendments to section 251 of the Criminal Code, which legalized abortion only in cases where pregnancy threatened the health of the mother. Under the amendment, abortions could only be performed by a licensed physician in an accredited hospital, and only after being approved by a therapeutic abortion committee (T.A.C.) which is a three-member panel of doctors. All other abortions, performed without the approval of a T.A.C. or in free-standing clinics, continued to be illegal and subject to criminal code sanctions. The T.A.C. system proved to be inaccessible to most women. More specifically, organizations, such as the VWC, felt the TAC process was often too slow and was unattainable for low-income women.\n\nIn mid-April 1970 a delegation of the VWC set out from Vancouver in a yellow convertible, a pickup truck, and a Volkswagen bus with a black coffin strapped on the roof. Aimed at emulating the On-to-Ottawa Trek of the Depression era, the Abortion Caravan traveled from Vancouver to Ottawa, stopping in twelve communities to galvanize support. As they traveled to Ottawa, members of the VWC stopped in cities and towns every night, holding public meetings and listening to women's concerns so they could bring their voices to the government. Along the way, the participants also held guerrilla theatre performances.\n\nThe Abortion Caravan arrived in Ottawa on Mother's Day weekend 1970. A convoy of Canadian women, over five hundred strong in support, arrived - coat hangers and a black coffin in tow - to demand the legalization of unrestricted access to abortion services for all Canadian women.\n\nParticipants of the Abortion Caravan declared \"war on the Government of Canada\", with hundreds of women from across Canada rallying for two days on Parliament Hill. At 24 Sussex Drive, the official residence of the Prime Minister, Prime Minister Pierre Trudeau was burned in effigy. A black coffin adorned with coat hangers, representing women who had died from self-induced or back-alley abortions, was left at the Prime Minister's front door.\n\nOn May 11, 1970, about 80 women donning black headscarves arrived at the House of Commons. The women surrounded the centennial flame carrying a black coffin. Approximately three dozen women, dressed in feminine attire, including heels and skirts, pantyhose and gloves, entered the House of Commons taking their seats in the various galleries circling the House. Once seated, the women quietly chained themselves to their seats, listening intently as, on the House floor, NDP MP Andrew Brewin asked the Minister of Justice John Turner if he would consider reviewing the abortion law; Turner said he doubted the law would be reviewed, closing discussion on the matter.\n\nJust before 3 p.m., one of the women rose from her seat in the gallery and began reciting the Abortion Caravan's prepared speech, interrupting debate on the floor of the House of Commons. As parliamentary guards approached the woman, a second woman stood up in another area of the gallery and continued to give the group's speech. One by one, the women rose from their seats, adding their voices to the group's speech and chanting \"free abortions on demand\".\n\nAs Parliamentary guards moved through the galleries apprehending the protesters and forcibly removing the women from their seats, one woman reportedly \"hurled a water bomb at the government benches before being rushed by security officers and marched from the building\"; other women had their chains \"removed by bolt-cutting guards and were heckled by onlookers as they were escorted from House\". The gallery disturbance caused by activists served as the climax of the Abortion Caravan, provoking the first adjournment of Parliament in its 103-year history, shutting down the House of Commons for over an hour.\n\nThe Abortion Caravan brought national attention to the opposition to the 1969 amendments and the movement for “unrestricted access to legal abortion.”\n\nIn 2012, a counter-protest movement was formed to highlight what they see as the injustice brought about by the original. On May 29, a team of young people set out re-tracing the steps of the 1970 Caravan. This team from the Canadian Centre for Bio-Ethical Reform (CCBR) used graphic images in order to force attention on what is being chosen.\n\n"}

He married Eva Torp in 1951, and together they had four children. In 1994 he married Inger Vestvik.\n\nFalck became Doctor of Medical Science, equivalent of PhD, in 1959. His thesis focused on the production of estrogen in the ovaries, and he attempted to show that this production is dependent on an interplay of two different hormone producing systems. His hypothesis has come to be called \"Falck's two-cell hypothesis of oestrogen synthes\". Between 1960 and 1970 he acted as associate professor, before becoming a full professor of histology in 1970, all at the University of Lund, Sweden.\n\nIn 1960–61 Falck and Nils-Åke Hillarp developed the Falck-Hillarp fluorescence method. This technique made it possible to study biologically active substances called monoamines – dopamine, noradrenaline, adrenaline and serotonin – on the cellular level employing fluorescence microscope. Consequently, it was then possible to demonstrate their presence in the central as well as peripheral nervous system. Thereby, it could be established that these monoamines were actually functioning as interneuronal transmitters (signal substances). The method has since its development been used several times, within fields such as dermatology and histochemistry. The publication on the chemical background was named among the 200 most cited papers of all time in 1991, and had at the time been cited 2,435 times.\n\nIn 2012, the Faculty of Medicine at the University of Lund arranged a symposium “From Nerve to Pills” celebrating the 50th anniversary of the initial publication of the F-H method.

His real name was Cao Yi while his courtesy name was Jingxiu, and he was better known to his contemporaries as Cao Jingxiu.\n\nCao Guojiu is believed to be a descendant of Cao Bin, a general of the early Song dynasty, and a younger brother of Empress Cao, the wife of Emperor Renzong of the Song dynasty. As none of Emperor Renzong's sons survived their father, the emperor designated a younger male relative, who later became Emperor Yingzong, as his successor. As such, Cao could not have been a maternal uncle of Emperor Yingzong, so his \"Imperial Uncle\" status seemed ambiguous. However, as the Chinese character \"jiu\" (舅), which means \"maternal uncle\", can also mean \"wife's brother\", it is believed that the latter meaning should apply to Cao. In other words, Cao was the \"Imperial Brother-in-Law\" of Emperor Renzong rather than an \"Imperial (Maternal) Uncle\" of any Song dynasty emperor.\n\nCao's younger brother, Cao Jingzhi (曹景植), abused his relationship with the imperial family by bullying others and engaging in corrupt practices. Cao tried to persuade his brother to change his ways but he did not listen. In the meantime, he also used his family fortune to help the poor and tried to make up for his brother's misdeeds. One day, Cao Jingzhi was accused by other officials in the imperial court of corruption and abuse of power. Cao felt so ashamed and disappointed by his brother's misconduct that he gave up his official career and went to the countryside to lead a reclusive life. During this time, he met the immortals Zhongli Quan and Lü Dongbin, who taught him Taoist magical arts. After many years of practice and cultivation, Cao himself also became an immortal.\n\nCao is often depicted dressed in official robes and holding a jade tablet or castanets. He is also regarded as the patron deity of acting and theatre.\n\nIn the television show \"Jackie Chan Adventures\", Cao was shown to be the Immortal who sealed away Tchang Zu, The Thunder Demon.

However, they decided to decline as their intentions were to create a dental fraternity. On November 15, 1882, seven dental students met at Mrs. Slattery's boarding house at #10 North State St., Ann Arbor, Michigan, and founded the first dental fraternity in the world.

The requirement that all companies which employed more than 50 workers must offer an employee health insurance plan or pay a fine would now be delayed until 2015, according to the Administration. The Administration, however, did not do anything to delay the individual health insurance mandate which was directed and individual people and families, rather than at companies and unions. In response, on July 11, 2013 by Rep. Todd Young (R-IN) introduced the Fairness for American Families Act, which would apply the same delay to the individual mandate requirement.\n\nA second bill, the Authority for Mandate Delay Act (), was introduced on July 11, 2013 by Rep. Timothy Griffin (R-AR). This bill would authorize the Obama Administration's decision to delay the employer mandate, a delay that many would consider illegal without explicit Congressional authorization.\n\nThe Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (PPACA), commonly called Obamacare or the Affordable Care Act (ACA), is a United States federal statute signed into law by President Barack Obama on March 23, 2010. Together with the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act, it represents the most significant government expansion and regulatory overhaul of the U.S. healthcare system since the passage of Medicare and Medicaid in 1965.\n\nThe ACA is aimed at increasing the affordability and rate of health insurance coverage for Americans, and reducing the overall costs of health care (for individuals and the government). It provides a number of mechanisms — including mandates, subsidies, and tax credits — to employers and individuals to increase the coverage rate and health insurance affordability. The law has failed to meet many of these goals, with some supporters now becoming opponents - including some unions. In May 2013, the United Food and Commercial Workers International Union, United Union of Roofers, Waterproofers and Allied Workers, and International Association of Firefighters complained about the increased costs caused by \"requiring health plans to cover dependents up to age 26, eliminate annual or lifetime coverage limits and extend coverage to people with pre-existing conditions.\" In July 2013, a letter signed by the leaders of the Teamsters, UFCW, and UNITE-HERE stated, \"the ACA will shatter not only our hard-earned health benefits, but destroy the foundation of the 40-hour work week that is the backbone of the American middle class... the law creates an incentive for employers to keep employees’ work hours below 30 hours a week... we can no longer stand silent in the face of elements of the Affordable Care Act that will destroy the very health and wellbeing of our members along with millions of other hardworking Americans...\"\n\nOn June 28, 2012, the United States Supreme Court upheld the constitutionality of most of the ACA in the case \"National Federation of Independent Business v. Sebelius\".\n\nThe law was championed by President Barack Obama and supported by most Democrats, but Republicans have tried numerous times to overturn the law. When the Obama Administration announced that it would be delaying the implementation of part of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, it was seen as a new opportunity to fight against the bill, leading to the proposal of the Authority for Mandate Delay Act and the Fairness for American Families Act.\n\n\"This summary is based largely on the summary provided by the Congressional Research Service, a public domain source.\"\n\nThe Fairness for American Families Act would amend the Internal Revenue Code, as amended by the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, to delay until 2015 the requirement that individuals maintain minimal essential health care coverage.\n\nThe Fairness for American Families Act was introduced into the House on July 11, 2013 by Rep. Todd Young (R-IN). It was referred to the United States House Committee on Ways and Means.The bill passed the House on July 17, 2013, by 251- 174 in Roll Call 363.\n\nWhen he introduced the Fairness for American Families Act, Rep. Young argued that \"rather than driving healthcare costs down, the individual mandate is imposing a new tax and burdensome costs on middle class families\" and therefore \"hardworking Americans deserve the same exemptions that President Obama is unilaterally granting to businesses and labor unions.\" House Majority Leader Eric Cantor agreed with this, announcing that the House would work on this bill the week of July 15, 2013.\n\nThe New York Times (NYT) described Obama's decision to delay the employer mandate as a \"self-inflicted wound\" which Republicans saw as an opportunity. The NYT suggested that a Republican strategy might begin by having multiple votes - one on affirming/legalizing President Obama's decision to delay the employer mandate (which Democrats would back) and then one on delaying the individual mandate (which Democrats might now have difficulty voting against). The Obama Administration's response to the criticism about this issue was seen as not very strong; the Administration refused to send a representative to a hearing about the matter being held at the House of Representatives. Republicans may be able to use these two bills to put pressure on the Democrats, because opposing the Fairness for American Families Act while supporting the Authority for Mandate Delay Act \"will make it appear as if they are providing a break to big business but not individuals.\"\n\n\n"}

It was also known as Gomm–Button disease in honour of the first two patients Sweet diagnosed with the condition.\n\nAcute, tender, erythematous plaques, nodes, pseudovesicles and, occasionally, blisters with an annular or arciform pattern occur on the head, neck, legs, and arms, particularly the back of the hands and fingers. The trunk is rarely involved. Fever (50%); arthralgia or arthritis (62%); eye involvement, most frequently conjunctivitis or iridocyclitis (38%); and oral aphthae (13%) are associated features.\nSS can be classified based upon the clinical setting in which it occurs: classical or idiopathic SS, malignancy-associated SS, and drug-induced SS.\n\nSS is a reactive phenomenon and should be considered a cutaneous marker of systemic disease. Careful systemic evaluation is indicated, especially when cutaneous lesions are severe or hematologic values are abnormal. Approximately 20% of cases are associated with malignancy, predominantly hematological, especially acute myelogenous leukemia (AML). An underlying condition (streptococcal infection, inflammatory bowel disease, nonlymphocytic leukemia and other hematologic malignancies, solid tumors, pregnancy) is found in up to 50% of cases. Attacks of SS may precede the hematologic diagnosis by 3 months to 6 years, so that close evaluation of patients in the “idiopathic” group is required.\n\nThere is now good evidence that treatment with hematopoietic growth factors — including granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF), which is used to treat AML, and granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor — can cause SS. Lesions typically occur when the patient has leukocytosis and neutrophilia but not when the patient is neutropenic. However, G-CSF may cause SS in neutropenic patients because of the induction of stem cell proliferation, the differentiation of neutrophils, and the prolongation of neutrophil survival.\n\nAlthough it may occur in the absence of other known disease, SS is often associated with hematologic disease (including leukemia), and immunologic disease (rheumatoid arthritis, inflammatory bowel disease, Behçet's syndrome).\n\nA genetic association has been suggested, but no specific genetic link has been identified.\n\nThe clinical differential diagnosis includes pyoderma gangrenosum, infection, erythema multiforme, adverse drug reactions, and urticaria. Recurrences are common and affect up to one third of patients.\n\nStudies show a moderate neutrophilia (less than 50%), elevated ESR (greater than 30 mm/h) (90%), and a slight increase in alkaline phosphatase (83%). Skin biopsy shows a papillary and mid-dermal mixed infiltrate of polymorphonuclear leukocytes with nuclear fragmentation and histiocytic cells. The infiltrate is predominantly perivascular with endothelial-cell swelling in some vessels, but vasculitic changes (blood clots; deposition of fibrin, complement, or immunoglobulins within the vessel walls; red blood cell extravasation;inflammatory infiltration of vascular walls) are absent in early lesions.\n\nPerivasculitis occurs secondarily, because of cytokines released by the lesional neutrophils. True transmural vasculitis is not an expected finding histopathologically in SS.\nSweet described a disease with four features: fever; leukocytosis; acute, tender, red plaques; and a papillary dermal infiltrate of neutrophils. This led to the name acute febrile neutrophilic dermatosis. Larger series of patients showed that fever and neutrophilia are not consistently present. The diagnosis is based on the two constant features, a typical eruption and the characteristic histologic features; thus the eponym \"Sweet's syndrome\" is used.\n\nSystemic corticosteroids such as (prednisone) can produce rapid improvement and are the “gold standard” for treatment. The temperature, white blood cell count, and eruption improve within 72 hours. The skin lesions clear within 3 to 9 days. Abnormal laboratory values rapidly return to normal. There are, however, frequent recurrences. Corticosteroids are tapered within 2 to 6 weeks to zero.\n\nResolution of the eruption is occasionally followed by milia and scarring. The disease clears spontaneously in some patients. Topical and/or intralesional corticosteroids may be effective as either monotherapy or adjuvant therapy.\nOral potassium iodide or colchicine may induce rapid resolution.\n\nPatients who have a potential systemic infection or in whom corticosteroids are contraindicated can use these agents as a first-line therapy.\nIn one study, indomethacin, 150 mg per day, was given for the first week, and 100 mg per day was given for 2 additional weeks. Seventeen of 18 patients had a good initial response; fever and arthralgias were markedly attenuated within 48 hours, and eruptions cleared between 7 and 14 days.\n\nPatients whose cutaneous lesions continued to develop were successfully treated with prednisone (1 mg/kg per day). No patient had a relapse after discontinuation of indomethacin.\nOther alternatives to corticosteroid treatment include dapsone, doxycycline, clofazimine, and cyclosporine. All of these drugs influence migration and other functions of neutrophils.\n\n"}
{"id": "21336496", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=21336496", "title": "Foodie", "text": "Foodie\n\nA foodie is a person who has an ardent or refined interest in food and who eats food not out of hunger but due to their interest or hobby. The terms \"gastronome\" and \"gourmet\" define the same thing, i.e. a person who enjoys food for pleasure.\n\nThe \"foodie\"—not as elitist as a gourmet, more discriminating than a glutton—was first named in print in the early 1980s. The term came into use almost simultaneously in the United States and Britain. Priority goes to Gael Greene, who, in June 1980, wrote in \"New York Magazine\" of a character who \"slips into the small Art Deco dining room of Restaurant d'Olympe ... to graze cheeks with her devotees, serious foodies.\" Immediately afterwards the foodie was defined in the British press. Ann Barr, features editor of the London magazine \"Harper's & Queen\", had asked readers to comment on a then-new obsession with food. Several readers' responses named Paul Levy, food writer on the same magazine, as the perfect example. Levy played along, contributing an anonymous article in August 1982, defining the term (\"Foodies are foodist. They dislike and despise all non-foodies\") and characterizing himself as the \"ghastly, his-stomach-is-bigger-than-his-eyes, original, appetite-unsuppressed, lip-smacking 'king foodie'\". The word gained currency rapidly, partly because Barr and Levy followed up with a book, \"The Official Foodie Handbook\", published in 1984.\n\nFoodies are a distinct hobbyist group. Typical foodie interests and activities include the food industry, wineries and wine tasting, breweries and beer sampling, food science, following restaurant openings and closings and occasionally reopenings, food distribution, food fads, health and nutrition, cooking classes, culinary tourism, and restaurant management. A foodie might develop a particular interest in a specific item, such as the best egg cream or burrito. Many publications have food columns that cater to foodies and many of the websites carrying the name foodie have become popular amongst the foodies. Interest by foodies in the 1980s and 1990s gave rise to the Food Network and other specialized food programming, popular films and television shows about food such as Top Chef and Iron Chef, a renaissance in specialized cookbooks, specialized periodicals such as Gourmet Magazine and Cook's Illustrated, growing popularity of farmers' markets, food-oriented websites like Zagat's and Yelp, publishing and reading food blogs like Foodbeast and foodieworld, specialized kitchenware stores like Williams-Sonoma and Sur La Table, and the institution of the celebrity chef.\n\nFoodies have a significant social media presence; food lovers have created their own YouTube channels where they show what they cook and where they eat around the world. It has also become a common practice to take photos of food and beverages consumed at home or outside and share them on Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, or other media in a form of food porn.\n\nChris Onstad, author of the webcomic \"Achewood\" and the author of \"The Achewood Cookbook\", stated a dislike for the term. Onstad said \"There are so many words that already describe the concept of people who like food, or enjoy cooking, or enjoy knowing about cooking. \"Foodie\": It's like the infantile diminutive—you put a \"y\" on the end of everything to make it childlike. We don't need it. It's embarrassing. 'Girl, I'm a foodie.' Like oh my God.\"\n\nMany journalists, like Roberto A. Ferdman, author of \"Stop Calling Yourself a 'Foodie\"' in the Washington Post, also criticize the word saying \"There is a great irony in describing yourself as a food insider in a way no actual food insider ever would.\" Ferdman claims that people who associate themselves with being a \"foodie\" are in fact distancing themselves from the group they wish to be associated with. The author then states that there is nothing wrong with having an interest in food, in fact this popular trend is helping the food movement thrive. Ferdman's main argument is that since the word is so widely used, its meaning has become ubiquitous and some meaning is lost upon the need to constantly announce how much someone likes to eat.\n\nDutch pranksters tricked self-identified foodies at a food Expo to mistake McDonald's fast food for refined gourmet presentations.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "46425255", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=46425255", "title": "G factor in non-humans", "text": "G factor in non-humans\n\nThe \"g\" factor, or general factor, of intelligence is a psychometric construct that summarizes observed correlations between an individual’s scores on various measures of cognitive abilities. First described in humans, a \"g\" factor has since been identified in a number of non-human species.\n\nThe amount of variance explained by \"g\" varies widely among species. The reasons for this are not clear; J. P. Rushton has attempted to place g in an evolutionary frame of reference. Non-human models of \"g\" have been used in genetic and neurological research on intelligence to help understand the mechanisms behind variation in \"g\".\n\nMost measures of \"g\" in humans, including most IQ tests, rely heavily on language and verbal ability, and so they cannot be directly applied to non-human animals. Several alternative measures have been developed to study intelligence in animals, relying on the observation of animals in natural situations or on behavioral tasks in experimental settings. The tasks focus on such things as innovation and problem solving, response to novelty, habit reversal and inhibition, and social learning and culture. A comprehensive assessment often includes a battery of tests involving several sorts of behavior.\n\nInnovation and problem solving tasks are the most widely used experimental measures of non-human intelligence. The same assessment often uses several tasks, which may involve memory, spatial reasoning, visual and auditory discrimination, and object manipulation. Innovation has often been observed in animals, typically involving novel solutions to everyday problems or the use of tools to achieve a goal. Instances include termite fishing in chimpanzees or nut cracking in robust capuchins. Such observations provide ecologically valid measures without the need for experimentation.\n\nResponse to novelty is often used in intelligence measures in human infants., for the amount of interest in novel objects and the time spent exploring a novel environment correlate with intelligence later in life. Responses to novelty in non-humans are thought to correlate similarly, though it can often be difficult to quantify this measure appropriately.\n\nHabit reversal and inhibition are commonly used to test primate intelligence. These tasks require the animal to suppress a learned response or instinctive action in order to receive a reward. For example, in the detour problem, a food reward behind an obstacle must be retrieved by following an indirect route. To do this, the subject must inhibit its tendency to move straight towards the goal.\n\nA number of intelligence tests for animals include social learning. The more an individual participates in and gains from social learning, the higher its intelligence is judged to be. Such data are most widely available for primates in social situations, often in wild populations, rather than experimental set-ups Such observations are more ecologically valid than some other measures. One basis for their inclusion in IQ studies centers around the theory of cultural intelligence.\n\nA large portion of the research into non-human \"g\" factors has focused on mammals. Being mammals themselves, humans have a great deal in common with other mammals, sharing similarities in aspects such as physiology and neurochemistry. Social learning and culture may have played a large role in the evolution of intelligence in humans (including its factor structure) and as such it follows that other animals may have similar single-factor models of intelligence.\n\nDue to their close taxonomic proximity to humans, primates (great apes in particular) have been the focus of a large part of the research into the prevalence of a \"g\" factor in non-human animals.\n\nA meta-analysis of 4000 primate behaviour academic papers searching for instances of innovation, social learning, tool use, and extractive foraging was conducted to investigate the components of these behaviours in 62 species of primates. A Principal Components Analysis of these cognitive measures (as well as three socio-ecological variables, (diet breadth, percentage fruit in diet, and group size) revealed a single factor explaining 47% of the variance onto which the cognitive measures and diet breadth (somewhat) loaded. This would suggest that non-human primates, as a whole, have a \"g\" factor similar to that observed in humans.\n\nMice and rats have been used as model organisms in research for hundreds of years and have been a staple of experimental psychology for decades. Both have been proposed as easily accessible models for studying \"g\". The \"g\" factor loadings in Long-Evans rats has been shown to range from .43 to as high as .70 in cognitive ability tasks. In mice, about 55-60% of the individual variance in tests of cognitive ability can be explained by \"g\".\n\nNon-human models of intelligence can be used in individual differences research for study designs that are difficult or unethical to perform using human subjects. Examples of this include experimental drug testing and multi-generational studies that would take a very long time in humans.\n\nOne such aspect of intelligence well suited for a non-human model is the experimental study of genetic aspects of \"g\". Mice are currently being considered as a potential model due to their widespread availability, detailed knowledge of their genome, and the ease with which strains can be bred to exhibit individual differences in cognitive ability.\n\nNon-human models can also be used in neuroscience for neuroanatomical studies investigating intelligence and the influence of \"g\" on the neurological level. Rats have been used in experimental manipulations of intelligence using chemicals administered prenatally. These effects are partially reversed by stimulation of neurological development and suggest that neuronal and synaptic numbers have an effect on \"g\".\n\nA 2012 study identifying individual chimpanzees that consistently performed highly on cognitive tasks found clusters of abilities instead of a general factor of intelligence. This study used individual-based data and claim that their results are not directly comparable to previous studies using group data that have found evidence for \"g\". The authors propose a future research should test multiple individuals of multiple species on a variety of tasks to investigate this discrepancy.\n\n"}

The first such initiative in Singapore, the programme was launched in December 2007 and spearheaded by Asia Pacific Breweries (APBS), an Asian Brewery listed on the Singapore Exchange.\n\nA recurring message of the campaign is that consuming 5 or more units of alcohol at a single sitting constitutes binge drinking. This is only one possible definition of binge drinking and other standards have been adopted by anti-binge drinking campaigns in countries like Australia by the National Health and Medical Research Council. In 2008, GYSB released the findings of a survey into the drinking habits of young adults in Singapore aged between 18 and 25. The findings of this survey showed an increasing prevalence of binge drinking among youths, and a greater tendency towards excessive drinking among female drinkers.\n\nGet Your Sexy Back was originally conceived by four students from the Nanyang Technological University (NTU), as part of a school project. The students identified several factors responsible for binge drinking among youths in Singapore and approached APBS for support. The programme was subsequently adopted by APBS as part of its corporate social responsibility initiatives in Singapore.\n\nGYSB was first launched in December 2007 with the aim of encouraging responsible drinking behaviour among young adults from 18 – 25 years old by raising the social currency of moderation. The programme engages its target audience through various youth-related activities and platforms, broadly spanning the areas of music, fashion, sports and friendship. GYSB's slogan: “It’s not the drinking, it’s how you’re drinking” was adapted with permission from a New Zealand campaign by the Alcohol Advisory Council of New Zealand (ALAC).\n\nThe programme has been present at a number of youth-oriented events, particularly in conjunction with tertiary student associations and national youth bodies. These events include the NTU Surf n Sweat, National Vertical Marathon, the Seventeen magazine Queen of Queens and the Singapore Management University (SMU) Waikiki. In partnering these events, the programme has frequently drawn on support from other corporate partners including Singaporean fashion label NewUrbanMale.com, outdoor media specialists Clear Channel Singapore, as well as convenience chains Cheers and 7-Eleven.\n\nThe campaign has also been actively involved in the recruitment of youth volunteers and volunteer ambassadors to pledge their support for the cause of moderate drinking. Recruitment of volunteers has mainly been conducted online via the campaign website, in the various tertiary campuses, as well as at roadshows held at shopping malls.\n\nIn February 2010, an article in the TODAY newspaper cited GYSB as an example of a highly successful youth-oriented campaign. The article also stated that more and more youths have been pledging their support for moderate drinking since the launch of GYSB in 2007.\n\nThe GYSB programme encourages youths to live active, healthy social lives by engaging in activities other than binge drinking. It has grouped these activities into four main youth-oriented platforms.\n\nTo coincide with the relaunch of GYSB on 16 October 2008, singer-songwriter Jillian-Marie Thomas, also a volunteer ambassador, wrote and composed a theme song for the GYSB programme.\n\nGYSB also entered into a collaboration with Sony Music Entertainment, producing a set of GYSB CD inserts which were released together with the launch of the 'Capricorn' album from Taiwanese singer Jay Chou in October 2008.\n\nOn 4 April 2009, GYSB staged a concert at The Heeren shopping mall featuring a Singaporean band, \"Da Feng Chui\". The band, who was an on Channel U's Superband 2008 talent-search, and also launched their debut album in conjunction with the concert dedicating one of the songs on the album to the Get Your Sexy Back campaign.\n\nOn 9 December 2009, GYSB staged a music concert in support of responsible drinking at popular nightspot Velvet Underground. The concert featured regional superstar JJ Lin, SuperBand 2008 runners-up Da Feng Chui, Project Superstar alumni Chen Diya and Carrie Yeo, homegrown singer/songwriter Jillian Marie Thomas, and indie-alternative band en(x). All proceeds from the concert were donated to sporting clubs and student associations from Singapore's three main universities. Also announced at the concert were a new range of GYSB T-shirts, designed by local fashionistas, designers and fashion bloggers; and the details of a new membership benefits programme dubbed the GYSB Friends Card.\n\nSingaporean fashion and lifestyle label NewUrbanMale.com (NUM) designed an exclusive range of 'NUMXGYSB' T-shirts in October 2008. The shirts, each bearing the slogan \"Two beers or not two beers\" were retailed at selected NUM stores island-wide and were designed by NUM founder Shenzi Chua who has likened the slogan to a question on the difficult choices confronting youths when dealing with alcohol.\n\nIn December 2009, GYSB launched the third generation of GYSB T-shirts with a collection of three designs by local fashion bloggers Dinnie & Ridhwan, design student Sid Lim and T-shirt printing specialists Ministry of Press.\n\nOn 18 Oct 2008, GYSB teamed up with Nanyang Technological University (NTU) Sports Club to reach out to students at the NTU Street Challenge, the university's largest annual on-campus sporting event.\n\nGYSB was also supported by the National Vertical Marathon 2009, Singapore Management University (SMU) Surf n Sweat 2009, SMU Waikiki, Freshmen Sports Orientation Camp and Sports Fiesta.\n\nIn 2007, the student founders of GYSB created a group page on the popular social media platform, Facebook to serve as an avenue where like-minded youths could come together and share their thoughts and experiences on moderate drinking.\n\nIn April 2009, a group of National University of Singapore (NUS) students, created and distributed a game via Facebook called \"GYSB Matching Fury\" as a way of spreading the message of moderate drinking via social networks.\n\nIn December 2009, GYSB announced the launch of a membership benefits programme called the GYSB Friends Card. Given away free to programme supporters, the card gives discounts and other privileges at retailers across Singapore. Current commercial partners include Leftfoot, Times the Bookshop and Ministry of Press.\n\n\n\n"}

The campaign's title, HNO, reflects the program's purpose, which is to have customers say \"No\" to \"HO\", the chemical formula for water. The program taught waiters how to use \"suggestive selling techniques\" to offer a variety of alternative beverages when diners asked for water.\n\nIn July 2001, a link to a story about the program's success at Olive Garden was posted to Cockeyed.com. The link was reposted around the internet, until the story was taken down by Coca-Cola on August 2, 2001, for fears it might be misinterpreted. On August 20, 2001, the story was covered by \"The New York Times\", and subsequently by a number of news providers.\n\nThe campaign ran only in the United States.\n\nThe HNO campaign had been conducted through an Internet memo to distributors and restaurants. In July 2001, Rob Cockerham, a graphic designer in Sacramento, came across the Olive Garden success story following an online search, and posted a link to the story on his website, Cockeyed.com. In an interview with \"The New York Times\", Cockerham noted how \"I had to assure more than one person that this was not a prank, and that it was a real article from Coca-Cola.\"\n\nOn August 2, 2001, about a week after the success story link was posted to Cockeyed.com, the Coca-Cola portal was closed. Polly Howes, a spokeswoman for Coca-Cola, stated that the story might be misinterpreted by \"folks who aren't in a sales-related business\" and that the site was due to be dismantled.\n\nFollowing the \"New York Times\" article, the story was covered by major news providers, including \"Daily Mail\", \"Sunday Herald Sun\", \"Evening Standard\" and was featured on \"The Glass House.\"\n\nIn a success story on Coca-Cola's online public relations portal, entitled \"The Olive Targets Tap Water & WINS\", Coca-Cola described the purpose, implementation, and success in reducing \"tap water incidence\".\n\nCoca-Cola stated that customers chose tap water out of habit, and that selling alternative beverages would increase guest satisfaction:\n\nWater. It's necessary to sustain life, but to many Casual Dining restaurant chains it contributes to a dull dining experience for the customer. Many customers choose tap water not because they enjoy it, but because it is what they always have drunk in the past. In response, some restaurant chains are implementing programs to help train crews to sell alternative choices to tap water, like soft drinks and non-carbonated beverages, with the goal of increasing overall guest satisfaction. \nOlive Garden's stated goal was \"to influence customers to abandon their default choice of tap water and experience other beverage choices to improve their dining experience\".\n\nThe Olive Garden suffered from a \"high water incidence rate\" and \"wanted their restaurant crews to emphasize the broad array of alternative beverage selections available\" so as \"to influence customers to abandon their default choice of tap water and experience other beverage choices to improve their dining experience.\" In response, the Coca-Cola USA-Fountain offered the tap water reduction program H2NO. The H2NO program featured \"beverage suggestive selling techniques (a technique used when a server suggests a profitable beverage in place of water to the customer during the ordering process).\" Alternative beverages including soft drinks, non-carbonated beverages and alcohol would be offered which would lead to higher \"overall check averages\" and greater profits. To further improve the effectiveness of the program, the \"Olive Garden developed an employee incentive contest linked to H2NO with CCUSA-Fountain called 'Just Say No to HO.'\"\n\nThe success story noted how \"because of its own successful campaign against water, The Olive Garden has recently sent a powerful message to the entire restaurant industry - less water and more beverage choices mean happier customers\" stating how:\n\nWhen the contest was completed, almost all participating restaurants realized significant increases in beverage sales and reduced levels of tap water incidence - a strong indication that Olive Garden restaurants succeeded in enhancing the customer's dining experience. And perhaps most importantly, Olive Garden expects to see this trend continue as the skills learned become part of the crew's everyday interaction with restaurant customers.\n\nThe program and Olive Garden success story were widely ridiculed.\n\nOn August 22, 2001, Peter Gleick, the director of the Pacific Institute, wrote a letter to the editor of \"The New York Times\", criticizing the campaign, noting how \"both PepsiCo and Coca-Cola use perfectly potable tap water as the source of their bottled waters, Aquafina and Dasani. I guess tap water is O.K., if we can be made to pay for it.\"\n\nIn a report by Corporate Accountability International, \"Tapping Congress to Get Off the Bottle\", the report criticized the campaign as part of how \"bottlers have employed a range of marketing tactics that have overtly disparaged the tap.\" The Olive Garden success story and the H2NO program have been cited in literature as examples of the bottled water industry's aggressive advertising campaigns which views tap water as an impediment to increased profits.\n\n"}

It is designed to support and expand the physical capabilities of its users, particularly people with physical disabilities. There are two primary versions of the system: HAL 3, which only provides leg function, and HAL 5, which is a full-body exoskeleton for the arms, legs, and torso.\n\nIn 2011, Cyberdyne and Tsukuba University jointly announced that hospital trials of the full HAL suit would begin in 2012, with tests to continue until 2014 or 2015. By October 2012, HAL suits were in use by 130 different medical institutions across Japan. In February 2013, the HAL system became the first powered exoskeleton to receive global safety certification. In August 2013, HAL received EC certification for clinical use in Europe as the world's first non-surgical medical treatment robot. In addition to its medical applications, the HAL exoskeleton has been used in construction and disaster response work.\n\nThe first HAL prototype was proposed by Yoshiyuki Sankai, a professor at Tsukuba University. Fascinated with robots since he was in the third grade, Sankai had striven to make a robotic suit in order “to support humans.” In 1989, after receiving his Ph.D. in robotics, he began the development of HAL. Sankai spent three years, from 1990 to 1993, mapping out the neurons that govern leg movement. It took him and his team an additional four years to make a prototype of the hardware.\n\nThe third HAL prototype, developed in the early 2000s, was attached to a computer. Its battery alone weighed nearly and required two helpers to put on, making it very impractical. By contrast, later HAL-5 model weighs only and has its battery and control computer strapped around the waist of the wearer.\n\nCyberdyne began renting the HAL suit out for medical purposes in 2008. By October 2012, over 300 HAL suits were in use by 130 medical facilities and nursing homes across Japan. The suit is available for institutional rental, in Japan only, for a monthly fee of US$2,000. In December 2012, Cyberdyne was certified ISO 13485 – an international quality standard for design and manufacture of medical devices – by Underwriters Laboratories. In late February 2013, the HAL suit received a global safety certificate, becoming the first powered exoskeleton to do so. In August 2013, the suit received an EC certificate, permitting its use for medical purposes in Europe as the first medical treatment robot of its kind.\n\nWhen a person attempts to move their body, nerve signals are sent from the brain to the muscles through the motor neurons, moving the musculoskeletal system. When this happens, small biosignals can be detected on the surface of the skin. The HAL suit registers these signals through a sensor attached to the skin of the wearer. Based on the signals obtained, the power unit moves the joint to support and amplify the wearer's motion. The HAL suit possesses a cybernic control system consisting of both a user-activated “voluntary control system\" known as Cybernic Voluntary Control (CVC) and a “robotic autonomous control system\" known as Cybernic Autonomous Control (CAC) for automatic motion support.\n\nHAL is designed to assist the disabled and elderly in their daily tasks, but can also be used to support workers with physically demanding jobs such as disaster rescue or construction. HAL is mainly used by disabled patients in hospitals, and can be modified so that patients can use it for longer-term rehabilitation. In addition, scientific studies have shown that, in combination with specially-created therapeutic games, powered exoskeletons like the HAL-5 can stimulate cognitive activities and help disabled children walk while playing. Further scientific studies have shown that HAL Therapy can be effectively used for rehabilitation after spinal cord injury or stroke.\n\nDuring the 2011 Consumer Electronics Show, it was announced that the United States government had expressed interest in purchasing HAL suits. In March 2011, Cyberdyne presented a legs-only HAL version for the disabled, health care professionals and factory workers. In November 2011, HAL was selected to be used for cleanup work at the site of the Fukushima nuclear accident. During the Japan Robot Week exhibition in Tokyo in October 2012, a redesigned version of HAL was presented, designed specifically for the Fukushima cleanup. In March 2013, ten Japanese hospitals conducted clinical tests of the newer legs-only HAL system. In late 2014, HAL exoskeletons modified for construction use entered service with the Japanese construction contractor Obayashi Corporation.\n\n\n"}

They frequently occur with exposure to new drugs, as they have not been fully tested and the full range of possible side-effects have not been discovered; they may also be listed as an adverse drug reaction with a drug, but are extremely rare. Some patients have multiple-drug intolerance. Patients who have multiple idiopathic effects that are nonspecific are more likely to have anxiety and depression.Idiosyncratic drug reactions appear to not be concentration dependent. A minimal amount of drug will cause an immune response, but it is suspected that at a low enough concentration, a drug will be less likely to initiate an immune response.\n\nIn adverse drug reactions involving overdoses, the toxic effect is simply an extension of the pharmacological effect (Type A adverse drug reactions). On the other hand, clinical symptoms of idiosyncratic drug reactions (Type B adverse drug reactions) are different from the pharmacological effect of the drug.\n\nThe proposed mechanism of most idiosyncratic drug reactions is immune-mediated toxicity. To create an immune response, a foreign molecule must be present that antibodies can bind to (i.e. the antigen) and cellular damage must exist. Very often, drugs will not be immunogenic because they are too small to induce immune response. However, a drug can cause an immune response if the drug binds a larger molecule. Some unaltered drugs, such as penicillin, will bind avidly to proteins. Others must be bioactivated into a toxic compound that will in turn bind to proteins. The second criterion of cellular damage can come either from a toxic drug/drug metabolite, or from an injury or infection.\nThese will sensitize the immune system to the drug and cause a response.\nIdiosyncratic reactions fall conventionally under toxicology.\n\n"}

There have been several versions of the regulations, the current legislation was introduced in 2017 (IRR17), repealing the 1999 regulations and implementing the 2013/59/Euratom European Union directive.\n\nThe main aim of the regulations as defined by the 1999 official code of practice was to \"establish a framework for ensuring that exposure to ionising radiation arising from work activities, whether man made or natural radiation and from external radiation or internal radiation, is kept as low as reasonably practicable (ALARP) and does not exceed dose limits specified for individuals\".\n\nThe regulations came into force on 1 January 2000, replacing the 'Ionising Radiations Regulations 1985'. They effectively implement the majority of the European Basic Safety Standards Directive '96/29/Euratom' under the auspices of the Health and Safety at Work etc. Act 1974. This European Directive is in turn a reflection of the recommendations of the International Commission on Radiological Protection.\n\nThe regulations are aimed at employers and are enforced by the Health and Safety Executive(HSE). They form the legal basis for ionising radiation protection in the United Kingdom (UK), although work with ionising radiation is also controlled in the UK through other statutory instruments such as the Nuclear Installations Act 1965 and the Radioactive Substances Act 1993.\n\nThe IRR99 make legal requirements including prior authorisation of the use of particle accelerators and x-ray machines, the appointment of \"radiation protection supervisors (RPS) and advisers (RPA)\", control and restriction of exposure to ionising radiation (including dose limits), and a requirement for local rules. Local rules including the designation of \"controlled areas\", defined as places where \"special procedures are needed to restrict significant exposure\".\n\nIn 2013 the European Union adopted directive 2013/59/Euratom which requires updated Ionising Radiations Regulations to implement the directive in UK law by 2018. Changes include reduced eye dose limits as a result of updated ICRP recommendations.\n\nThe regulations impose duties on employers to protect employees and anyone else from radiation arising from work with radioactive substances and other forms of ionising radiation. In the United Kingdom the Health and Safety Executive is one of a number of public bodies which regulates workplaces which could expose workers to radiation. \n\nRadiation itself is energy that travels either as electromagnetic waves, or as subatomic particles and can be categorised as either 'ionising' or 'non-ionising radiation'. \n\nIonising radiation occurs naturally but can also be artificially created. Generally people can be exposed to radiation externally from radioactive material or internally by inhaling or ingesting radioactive substances. Exposure to electromagnetic rays such as x-rays and gamma rays can, depending on the time exposed, cause sterility, genetic defects, premature ageing and death. \n\nNon-ionising radiation is the terms used to describe the part of the electromagnetic spectrum covering 'Optical radiation', such as ultraviolet light and 'electromagnetic fields' such as microwaves and radio frequencies. Health risks caused by exposure to this type of radiation will often be as a result of too much exposure to ultraviolet light either from the sun or from sunbeds which could lead to skin cancer.\n\nThe regulations are split into seven parts containing 41 regulations. under the following sections.\n\n\nIn addition to requiring that radiation employers ensure that doses are kept as low as reasonably practicable (ALARP) the IRR99 also defines dose limits for certain classes of person. Dose limits do not apply to people undergoing a medical exposure or to those acting as \"comforters and carers\" to such.\n\nThe main changes in the 2017 regulations are summarised in the approved code of practice. These include:\n\nThe introduction of the Ionising Radiation (Medical Exposure) Regulations 2017 (IRMER17, the legislation that governs medical exposures in the UK) amended IRR17 to remove the regulation concerning medical equipment. These requirements are now under IRMER17.\n\nThe dose limit to the lens of the eye has been reduced based on ICRP recommendation, the new limits are now as follows\n\n\n"}
{"id": "47779086", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=47779086", "title": "JUUL", "text": "JUUL\n\nJUUL Labs ( , like \"jewel\") is an electronic cigarette company which spun off from PAX Labs in 2017. It makes the JUUL e-cigarette, which was introduced by PAX Labs in 2015. JUUL is a type of e-cigarette that uses nicotine salts that exist in leaf-based tobacco for its key ingredient.\n\nThe JUUL became the most popular e-cigarette in the United States at the end of 2017 and has a market share of 72% as of September 2018. Its widespread use by youth has triggered multiple investigations by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration.\n\nJUUL, the electronic cigarette, was introduced by PAX Labs on June 1, 2015. In July 2017, JUUL was spun out of PAX Labs as an independent company. Tyler Goldman, former CEO of PAX Labs, was named CEO of JUUL after the spin-off. It was announced on December 11, 2017 that Goldman \"intends to pursue new entrepreneurial opportunities\" and was replaced by Kevin Burns. James Monsees is Chief Product Officer and board member at JUUL. Adam Bowen is Chief Technology Officer and board member at JUUL. Other board members include Nicholas Pritzker, whose family owned chewing tobacco giant Conwood, Riaz Valani, and Hoyoung Huh.\n\nAs the popularity of the JUUL e-cigarette has taken off, the company has grown quickly, from employing 200 people in September 2017 to 400 in May 2018 to over 800 by September 2018. , the JUUL e-cigarette is made in Shenzhen, China, like many other e-cigarettes, while the pods are made in the United States.\n\nJUUL Labs was co-founded by two former cigarette smokers, Adam Bowen and James Monsees. They first created a company called Ploom while they were product-design grad students at Stanford University, and later created the Pax vaporizer device for cannabis and loose-leaf tobacco before founding JUUL. , Bowen is Chief Technology Officer of JUUL and Monsees is Chief Product Officer.\n\nThe JUUL is a type of e-cigarette that uses nicotine salts (protonated nicotine) that exist in leaf-based tobacco for its key ingredient, rather than free-base nicotine. They received a US patent for their nicotine salt preparation in 2015. The nicotine salts are said to create an experience more like smoking than other e-cigarettes on the market, as JUUL attempts to deliver a nicotine peak in five minutes, similar to a traditional cigarette. Each cartridge (called a JUULpod) contains about the same amount of nicotine as one pack of cigarettes and delivers approximately 200 puffs. The amount of nicotine in each cartridge—5 percent, or 59 mg/ml—is substantially more than the majority of e-cigarettes on the market. In August 2018, JUUL introduced pods in 3 percent strengths for its mint and Virginia tobacco flavors. Each cartridge contains propylene glycol, glycerin, flavorings, and nicotine salts. Protonated nicotine lacks the harshness of tobacco smoke. According to Tory Spindle of Johns Hopkins University, \"Protonated nicotine formulations are problematic because they seemingly allow users to inhale much higher nicotine concentrations that they would otherwise be able to.\" JUUL pods come in eight flavors, of which mango is the most popular. A JUUL starter kit sells for about $49.99. The JUUL e-cigarette is shaped like a USB flash drive and recharges using a magnetic USB deck.\n\nJoel Johnson of \"co.design\" described the nicotine intake as \"eye-widening\" and its aesthetics as \"demure\". Upon initial release Ben Radding of \"Men's Fitness\" called JUUL the \"iPhone of E-cigs\", but said that it required \"getting used to.\" The comparison to the iPhone and other Apple products has been made by many other commentators. Pharmacologist James Pauly, a specialist in nicotine, notes that JUUL delivers more nicotine than other e-cigarettes, and that the salts also possibly reduce the harshness, making it relatively easy for a new smoker, such as a teenager, to consume more nicotine than they are aware of.\n\nCurrent JUUL investors include Tiger Global Management, mutual fund firm Fidelity Investments, and Tao Capital. In June 2018, JUUL reportedly raised $1.2 billion in a financing round that valued the company at more than $16 billion.\n\nUsing JUUL is very popular among teenagers. A 2017 study by the Truth Initiative found that 7% of teenagers ages 15–17 and 12% of young adults ages 18–24 use JUUL. Teenagers use the verb \"Juuling\" to describe their use of JUUL, which frequently takes place in bathroom stalls at school. Former PAX Labs CEO Goldman said to \"Fortune\" in 2016 that \"JUUL should not be used by those under the legal age, nor should any nicotine products, as stated by the U.S. Surgeon General.\" In 2018 Matt Myers, president of Campaign for Tobacco-Free Kids, said the design \"misleads about risk\" of addiction. The 2017 Truth Initiative survey found 63% of teens and young adults do not understand that the JUUL they use always contains nicotine.\n\nMany reasons have been proposed for JUUL's popularity among teenagers. Among these are its ease of concealment, sleek high-tech design, and JUUL pod flavors. JUUL's resemblance to a flash drive makes it easy to conceal, and its low vapor output and subtle scent, which can be passed off as perfume, mean that it can be used discreetly, even in class. Similarly, the device's small size allows it to be concealed in clothing or elsewhere; a high school in Newton, Massachusetts discovered a JUUL disguised as a sharpie, for instance. JUUL's sleek and high-tech design, which is often compared to that of the iPhone, is also often cited as a reason for its popularity with young people. Finally, JUUL's sweet flavors, especially the fruit and crème brûlée ones, are especially attractive to children, according to journalists, academics, and the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. In response, JUUL renamed some flavors—\"cool cucumber\" to \"cucumber\" and \"crème brûlée\" to \"creme\"—saying that it “heard the criticism” and “responded by simplifying the names and losing the descriptors.”\n\nA 2018 Truth Initiative survey found that 74% of JUUL users ages 12–17 got their device from a brick and mortar store, 52% got theirs from a friend or family member, and only 6% got theirs online (respondents could select multiple answers). For context, JUUL estimates that 90% of its sales are in brick and mortar stores.\n\nIn April 2018, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) requested that JUUL Labs turn over documents to \"better understand the reportedly high rates of youth use and the particular youth appeal of these products.\" The FDA's request included asking the company to provide documents about the design and marketing of the JUUL, research on the safety of the products, and whether certain features of the device's design appeal to specific age groups. FDA also asked eBay to remove several listings of JUUL products, which eBay complied with. FDA commissioner Dr. Scott Gottlieb expressed concern about how the JUUL can be easily disguised as a USB flash drive and that the JUUL delivers a high amount of nicotine. \"We don’t yet fully understand why these products are so popular among youth,\" Dr. Gottlieb said, adding that \"These documents may help us get there.\" In response, JUUL Labs stated that they would spend $30 million on a campaign to keep JUUL out of the hands of young people in addition to working with the FDA, which they announced in a press release in April 2018. JUUL Labs also announced their support for raising the minimum age for vaping products from 18 to 21. JUUL Labs CEO Kevin Burns said, \"we are committed to deterring young people, as well as adults who do not currently smoke from using our products. We cannot be more emphatic on this point: No young person or non-nicotine user should ever try JUUL.\" The FDA followed up by issuing more than 60 warning letters and fines to stores that were found to be illegally selling JUUL products to minors.\n\nIn September 2018, the FDA sent letters to JUUL Labs and the manufacturers of the four other largest e-cigarette brands in the US—R.J. Reynolds' Vuse, Altria's MarkTen, Imperial Brands' blu eCigs, and Japan Tobacco International's Logic—giving them 60 days to lay out their plans to address widespread youth use of their products. If they fail to comply, FDA may \"remove some or all of their flavored products that may be contributing to the rise in youth use from the market.\" FDA also sent over 1,300 warning letters to stores that undercover investigators had found to be selling JUUL and other e-cigarettes to minors, and issued 131 fines ranging from $279 to $11,182. JUUL responded with a statement that \"JUUL Labs will work proactively with FDA in response to its request.\" A JUUL spokeswoman also announced that JUUL has its own patrol of retailers who advertise to youths or who do not enforce age requirements, noting that it had requested the removal of over 5,500 posts from Instagram, 144 posts from Facebook Marketplace, and 33 from Amazon.com. In total, Instagram removed 4,562 of 5,500 posts, Facebook Marketplace removed 45 of 145, and Amazon took down 13 of 33. An April 2018 survey by the Truth Initiative found that 89% of adolescents who attempted to buy JUUL online succeeded, however, and Gottlieb said that JUUL's efforts \"didn’t have the intended impact or I wouldn’t be viewing the statistics I’m now seeing.\"\n\nThe FDA made an unannounced inspection of JUUL headquarters in late September 2018 to gather information on the firm's marketing methods. FDA announced afterwards that it had seized thousands of pages of documents on JUUL Labs' marketing practices. Shares of three Big Tobacco companies—Altria, Philip Morris International, and British American Tobacco—rose at the news of the inspection.\n\nOn November 13, 2018, 60 days after the FDA's ultimatum, JUUL announced it would stop accepting retail orders for mango, fruit, creme, and cucumber JUUL pods in compliance with the FDA's investigation. JUUL will continue to sell tobacco, mint and menthol pods in retail stores, and noted that it will renew retails sales of its other flavors at stores that that invest in age-verification technology. In addition, the company said they would shut down their Facebook and Instagram accounts in the U.S. that promote the use of flavored pods, which entice underage users.\n\nSales of JUUL increased 700% in 2016. , JUUL accounts for over 70% of the US e-cigarette market monitored by Nielsen. JUUL's market share in the US has increased by 10 percentage points since April 2018. According to JUUL Labs, 90% of JUUL products are purchased at retail stores . JUUL plans to sell their products internationally. \n\nAccording to Dow Jones VentureSource, JUUL Labs was the sixth-most valuable US startup in July 2018, behind companies like Uber Technologies Inc. and Airbnb Inc. JUUL’s revenue in 2017 was approximately $245 million and projected to be $940 million in 2018, while sales totaled $1.1 billion for the year ending July 2018.\n\nJUUL's success has inspired a flood of imitators, namely pod-mod devices with similar boxy designs. These devices come from companies ranging from startups to Big Tobacco company R.J. Reynolds. The company filed a complaint with the U.S. International Trade Commission (ITC) in early October 2018 over counterfeit products manufactured by companies in the United States and China that JUUL Labs says infringed on its US patents. The complaint seeks to end importation of these products into the US.\n\nIn May 2018, JUUL started selling in Israel, which did not regulate e-cigarettes at the time. Israel later banned JUUL in August 2018, citing public health concerns, according to a statement by the Ministry of Health. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, acting in his capacity as Health Minister, placed a complete ban on JUUL because it delivers nearly three times Israel's recommended amount of 20 mg/ml of nicotine. JUUL has appealed the ban to Israel's High Court of Justice.\n\nIn July 2018, JUUL announced it would launch in the United Kingdom. In August 2018, JUUL introduced its products into Canada, starting with an online launch before introducing them to vape shops, gas stations, and convenience stores in early September.\n\nJUUL is intensively marketed via Instagram and other social media. Of the $2.2 million JUUL spent on marketing in 2015 and 2016, $1 million went to online marketing, according to data from Kantar Media. JUUL's heavy reliance on social media marketing is unique among major e-cigarette brands in the US—blu and NJOY were initially promoted mainly with television advertising while Vuse and MarkTen relied on promotional expenditures to consumers and retailers—and is touted as a major reason for its success. JUUL's use of social media marketing is also relatively inexpensive: to promote Vuse, R. J. Reynolds Vapor Company spent over $16 million on television ads alone in 2015 and 2016, according to Kantar data. A 2018 study found that \"JUUL’s social media activities were highly correlated with JUUL retail sales.\" \n\nJUUL's marketing has been criticized for targeting youth. The themes emphasized in JUUL's marketing, especially freedom, relaxation, and sex appeal; the use of young models and imagery claimed to be appealing to young people; and the use of social media \"influencers\" and affiliates popular among youth are three reasons why some consider JUUL's marketing to be targeting youth. In 2015, John Schachter, director of state communications for Campaign for Tobacco-Free Kids (CTFK), voiced concern regarding the youth of men and women portrayed in JUUL's advertising, particularly in combination with the design, stating that \"We're seeing more and more irresponsible marketing of unregulated products such as e-cigarettes.\" Similarly, CTFK Vice President of Communications Wilmore stated that JUUL Labs \"used the same imagery and themes that tobacco companies have always used to appeal to kids, and they fueled it with social media.\"\n\nJUUL Labs argues that its marketing is targeted at adult cigarette smokers who are looking to quit. The rectangular design of the JUUL e-cigarette, for example, was chosen to avoid reminding smokers of a cigarette, according to a JUUL executive. In 2018, JUUL implemented a new marketing code to avoid the appearance of targeting youth. Changes brought about by the new code include only showcasing former smokers age 35 or older in ads, no longer featuring models on social media, removing social media accounts that marketed to teenagers, including @Doit4JUUL, which had more followers than the main JUUL account, and adding the label \"the alternative for adult smokers\" to its packaging and many of its ads.\n\nJUUL's marketing has been the focus of two lawsuits filed against the company since April 2018. The suits, both filed in California, claim that JUUL was deceptively marketed as safe even though a JUUL pod contains as much nicotine as an average pack of cigarettes. According to the first suit, filed in US District Court in April, \"the intense dosage of nicotine salts delivered by the Juul products resulted in an increased nicotine addiction, and an increased consumption of nicotine by [plaintiff] Colgate.\"\n\nJUUL's health concerns have been debated. Ari Atkins, Pax Labs' R&D engineer, said \"We don’t think a lot about addiction here because we’re not trying to design a cessation product at all.\" He added, \"anything about health is not on our mind.\" In April 2018, FDA Commissioner Dr. Scott Gottlieb stated that the nicotine in JUUL is sufficient to result in addiction. Gottlieb further stated, \"In some cases, our kids are trying these products and liking them without even knowing they contain nicotine. And that’s a problem, because as we know the nicotine in these products can rewire an adolescent’s brain, leading to years of addiction.\"\n\nConcerns about the effect of nicotine delivered by JUUL on the developing adolescent brain have led to a lawsuit against the company. The suit, filed in US District Court in New York in June 2018, alleges that JUUL contains more nicotine than necessary to satisfy an adult smoker, and that use of JUUL by the 15-year old son of the plaintiff made him \"heavily addicted to nicotine\" causing him to be \"anxious, highly irritable and prone to angry outbursts.\"\n\n"}

The 14-minute film was produced by the National Film Board of Canada in Montreal, where Lipsett had worked from 1958 to 1972, before committing suicide in 1986. The film is narrated by Xavier Dolan.\n\nUshev was inspired to make a film about Lipsett, after Robinson had forwarded him an email where the late filmmaker was discussed. Until that point, Ushev had never heard of Lipsett. He began to do some research and was surprised to learn that Lipsett had lived on the same street as him in Montreal. Ushev went to the building where Lipsett once lived and met with the concierge, who showed him a locker where belongings from former tenants were stored. There, Ushev discovered a small blue notebook with \"Lipsett\" written on it, containing notes by the late filmmaker.\n\nThe film was animated by hand-painting the frames, using computer editing to link the images. Ushev estimated that 40 frames were painted per day during production. \"Lipsett Diaries\" was Robinson's first attempt at screenwriting.

Through his publications and therapy sessions he was able to gain the attention/support from Hippolyte Bernheim: another Nancy Doctor that further evolved Liébeault's thoughts and practices to form what is known as the Nancy School.\n\nIt is referred to as the Nancy School to distinguish it from the antagonistic \"Paris School\" that was centred on the hysteria-centred hypnotic research of Jean-Martin Charcot at the Salpêtrière Hospital in Paris.\n\nLiébeault was born to a peasant family in Farrières France. While expected to become a priest, he rather started his medical studies at Strasbourg, where he obtained his medical degree in 1850. At Strasbourg, he stumbled upon an old book about animal magnetism and became fascinated with it.\n\nHe moved to Nancy, France in 1860 and opened up his own clinic. Having finally established a successful practice, his thoughts turned back to that book on animal magnetism and he decided to start experimenting with hypnotic therapies. He did this by offering his patients a strange bargain: they could either continue their standard methods of treatment and continue their usual fee or they could be treated hypnotically, through suggestion, for free. Naturally, at first, many patients stayed with their standard methods because hypnosis at this time was still controversial. As more and more patients started receiving the hypnotic treatment and spreading news of its success, Liébeault became known as \"Good Father Liébeault.\" \n\nIn 1866 he published his first book titled \"Le sommeil et les états analogues, considérés surtout du point de vue de l'action du moral sur le physigue\" (Sleep and its analogous states considered from the perspective of the action of the mind upon the body) that focused on the similarities between induced sleep (or trance) and natural sleep, the features of the hypnotic state, how the induction of sleep relates to the nervous system, and the phenomena of hallucinations. Within this theory, he labeled the key difference between sleep and the hypnotic state to be \"produced by suggestion and concentration on the idea of sleep and that the patient was \"en rapport\" with the hypnotist.\" This book was largely ignored by the medical profession due to the fact that it was obscurely written and sold very few copies. However, Liébeault's theory on the hypnotic state that he devised within this book engrossed the attention of a prominent Nancy doctor, and soon to be student of Liébeault himself, Hippolyte Bernheim.,\n\nBernheim, born in Alsace, received his medical degree from Strasbourg for internal medicine, specializing in heart disease and typhoid fever., From hearing of the reputation Liébeault was establishing with his work in hypnosis and from reading his first publication, Bernheim skeptically visited the hypnotic clinic to see for himself if all of the stories he had been hearing were true. His amazement of what was happening led him to regularly visit the clinic to lean Liébeault's methods, and eventually to abandon his practice with internal medicine to become a full-time hypnotherapist. Bernheim humbly became a student of Liébeault and eventually came to study the hypnotic state with him as a colleague.\n\nBernheim was able to bring Liébeault's ideas about suggestibility into the attention of the medical world. His focus was on the patients rather than the hypnotist because he believed that the patients held the important factors to be hypnotized. He believed that every human being has the trait of suggestibility but each just varied to the degree of which. This idea became a staple in the train of thought of the Nancy doctors. He wrote these thoughts and others, like how \"suggestible patients could be successfully treated by straightforward persuasion techniques as well as by hypnosis,\" in his book \"De la Suggestion et de ses Applications à la Thérapeutique\" (Suggestive Therapeutics).\nAlthough Bernheim was the leading proponent of suggestion accounting for hypnotic phenomena, he never took full credit for it all. He argued that \"while suggestion was proposed by Abbé Faria, and was applied by James Braid, it was perfected by Liébeault.\"\n\nLiébeault and his followers did not agree with the views of Charcot and the Salpêtrière hospital's school of thought. In fact they were opposed to the ideas of the hysteria-centered school of thought that was the hallmark of Jean-Martin Charcot's Paris school. Instead they believed that:\nThey believed that the deeply hypnotized subject responds automatically to suggestion before his intellectual centers have had time to bring their inhibitory action into play.\n\nLiebeault, Bernheim, and the school in Nancy believed that hypnosis was due to the physiological property in the brain of suggestibility. Bernheim discovered that if he gave a subject a suggestion to return to him at ten o'clock in 13 days while under hypnosis, the subject would show up at the exact time Bernheim had suggested. The subject showed no recollection of receiving a suggestion, and stated that the \"idea presented itself to his mind only at the moment at which he was required to execute it.\" In Bernheim's \"Latent Memories and Long-Term Suggestions\", he proposed that post-hypnotic suggestions were a result of his subjects periodically falling into a hypnotic state and remembering the suggestions they received from him while previously under hypnosis. Below is a description of one of his experiments on post-hypnotic suggestion.\n\"To one, I tell her during her sleep:—\"Next Thursday (in five days) you will take the glass that is on the night table and put it in the suitcase that is at the foot of your bed.\" Three days later, having put her back to sleep, I say to her: \"Do you remember what I ordered you to do?\" She answers: \"Yes, I must put the glass in my suitcase Thursday morning, at eight o'clock.\"—\"Have you thought about it since I told you?\"—\"No\"—\"Think hard.\"—\"I thought about it the following morning at eleven o'clock.\"—\"Were you awake or asleep?\"—\"I was in a drowsy state.\" (Bernheim, 1886a, pp. 109–110)\"\nBernheim theorized that memories of suggestions subjects received under hypnosis were not unconscious, instead they were latent, or dorminant until it is revived when the subject drifts into a hypnotic state.\n\nOn the other hand Charcot was the director of the Paris's large Salpetriere Hospital. He claimed that \"hypnotizability and hysteria were aspects of the same underlying abnormal neurological condition.\" Therefore, he doubted the view of the Nancy school: that hypnotic susceptibility was a normal characteristic. Instead, \"Charcot speculated that the root cause of hysteria lay in a hereditary, progressive, and generalized degeneracy of the nervous system that interferes with the ability to integrate and interconnect memories and ideas in the normal way.\" While studying hysteria in Charcot's famous patient Lucie, Charcot and Janet theorized that all post-hypnotic suggestions were performed by a \"dissociated consciousness\". They came to this conclusion because when Lucie would have symptoms of hysteria, she would recall childhood fears. Janet then used this research as evidence that tramautic events of the past lead to the onset of symptoms of hysteria which resulted in a dissociated conscious that was expressed in hypnotic neurosis. Charcot believed that hypnotic neurosis could be described to follow three stages: catalepsy, lethargy, and somnambulism. These ideas were implemented into Charcot's grand theory of hypnotism. The theory of grand hypnotism was presented by Charcot to the French scientific organization and was accepted as a legitimate study.\n\nBernheim countered Charcot, by stating that provoked sleep was simply a consequence of suggestion. This was the exact opposite of the belief held by Charcot that suggestion was due to provoked sleep from the disorder of hypnotic neurosis. Bernheim believed that the \"..automatic execution of suggested acts could happen while awake and without somnambulism.\" He stated that \"Sleep, which suspends the power of will and reasoning, merely facilitated the brain's acceptance of the suggested idea.\" This idea led Bernheim to accuse Charcot of \"creating a cultural hysteria\" at the Salpêtrière hospital that was in fact due to the suggestion and charisma of Charcot's showmanship. Bernheim pointed out that Charcot's subjects were aware of what was expected of them while under hypnosis, Charcot and his colleagues even discussed what they expected of the patient in front of them. This included Charcot's convulsions which he implemented as a hallmark symptom of hypnotic neurosis. Charcot's hysteria-stricken subjects gained much popularity in the hospital at Paris, and in turn the entire country.\n\nIn the end, around 1891 the Salpetriere protagonists admitted openly that they have been wrong. \"Charcot too, admitted his errors on hypnotism and privately predicted that his theories of hysteria would not long survive him\" Besides his mistakes, \"Charcot was among the first to explore interactions between emotional and physical factors, and he raised the important subjects of hysteria and hypnosis out of scientific obscurity\"\n\nOne of the first influential researchers of hypnotism was Indo-Portuguese monk, Abbé Faria. He was a pioneer of the scientific study of hypnotism who believed hypnosis worked purely through the power of suggestion.\n\nThe Scottish surgeon James Braid, focused on the susceptibility of the subjects and not on what the hypnotist was doing. By doing this Braid was able to make a revolutionary observation and conclusion by having his subjects stare at and concentrate on a shiny object. He notice that \"the starting paralyzed the eye muscles, he concluded, and the fixed attention weakened the mind, resulting in an unusual state of the nervous system, halfway between sleep and wakefulness.\" \n\nFrom this conclusion Braid announced this discovery as being neurohypnology, or nervous sleep. Braid also proposed that hypnosis would and could have a number of clinical uses, including being useful for surgical anaesthesia; all of which helped pave the way for the establishment of scientific hypnotism—and, because Braid approached hypnotism as a scientist and natural philosopher, he was able to move hypnotism beyond controversy and mystery, and give it a respectable face.\n\nBernheim was a great asset to Liébeault's studies and research on hypnotism. Unlike Liébeault, Bernheim was proficient at writing effectively and communicating all of their elaborate ideas. In the book \"Pioneers of Psychology\", it states that \"Bernheim was effective at elaborating these ideas in several books and articles that came to be identified as the main statements of the Nancy school.\"\n\nThe research and theories produced by the Nancy School has had a great impact on our society today. Multiple research studies have been tested to show that these techniques are safe and effective in certain situations. D. Barrett stated that it is also \"becoming clear that the skills one needs to respond to hypnosis are similar to those necessary to experience trance-like states in daily life.\" According to K. Cherry, \"the technique has also been clinically proven to provide medical and therapeutic benefits, most notably in the reduction of pain and anxiety. It has even been suggested that hypnosis can reduce the symptoms of dementia.\" While reading through articles and research, hypnosis can affect people differently depending on their state of mind. Experiments today have given us enough information to show that hypnosis and the power of suggestion can help with certain problems in daily life; whether it be trying to quit smoking or to relieve the pain of consistent headaches.\n\nThere were many influential people in the history of psychology that have been themselves influenced by Nancy School and the concept that it believed in. With this influence many of these psychology figures have been able to accomplish great things for psychology. These figures include, but are not limited to:\n\nHistory of hypnosis\n\n\n"}
{"id": "56153", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=56153", "title": "Ophthalmology", "text": "Ophthalmology\n\nOphthalmology (, or ) is a branch of medicine and surgery (both methods are used) that deals with the anatomy, physiology and diseases of the eyeball and orbit. An ophthalmologist is a specialist in medical and surgical eye disease. Their credentials include a doctorate degree in medicine, followed by an additional four years of Ophthalmology residency training. They may or may not receive residency training in internal medicine, pediatrics, or general surgery before the ophthalmology residency. Additional training may be sought through a fellowship in a particular specialty of eye pathology. Ophthalmologists are allowed to use medications to treat eye diseases, implement laser therapy, and perform surgery when needed. Ophthalmologists may participate in academic research on the diagnosis and treatment for eye disorders.\n\nA partial list of the most common diseases diagnosed and treated by Ophthalmologists include:\n\n\nFollowing are examples of methods of diagnosis performed in a eye examination \n\n\n\nEye surgery, also known as ocular surgery, is surgery performed on the eye or its adnexa by an ophthalmologist.The eye is a fragile organ, and requires extreme care before, during, and after a surgical procedure. An expert eye surgeon is responsible for selecting the appropriate surgical procedure for the patient, and for taking the necessary safety precautions.\n\nOphthalmology includes subspecialities which deal either with certain diseases or diseases of certain parts of the eye. Some of them are:\n\nThe Greek roots of the word ophthalmology are ὀφθαλμός (\"ophthalmos\", \"eye\") and -λoγία (-\"logia\", \"study, discourse\"), i.e., \"the study of eyes\". The discipline applies to all animal eyes, whether human or not, since the practice and procedures are quite similar with respect to disease processes, while differences in anatomy or disease prevalence, whether subtle or substantial, may differentiate the two.\n\nIn the Ebers Papyrus from ancient Egypt dating to 1550 BC, a section is devoted to eye diseases.\n\nThe pre-Hippocratics largely based their anatomical conceptions of the eye on speculation, rather than empiricism. They recognized the sclera and transparent cornea running flushly as the outer coating of the eye, with an inner layer with pupil, and a fluid at the centre. It was believed, by Alcamaeon (5th century BC) and others, that this fluid was the medium of vision and flowed from the eye to the brain by a tube. Aristotle advanced such ideas with empiricism. He dissected the eyes of animals, and discovering three layers (not two), found that the fluid was of a constant consistency with the lens forming (or congealing) after death, and the surrounding layers were seen to be juxtaposed. He and his contemporaries further put forth the existence of three tubes leading from the eye, not one. One tube from each eye met within the skull.\n\nThe Greek physician Rufus of Ephesus (1st century AD) recognised a more modern eye, with conjunctiva, extending as a fourth epithelial layer over the eye. Rufus was the first to recognise a two-chambered eye, with one chamber from cornea to lens (filled with water), the other from lens to retina (filled with an egg white-like substance).\n\nCelsus the Greek philosopher of the 2nd century AD gave a detailed description of cataract surgery by the couching method.\nThe Greek physician Galen (2nd century AD) remedied some mistakes including the curvature of the cornea and lens, the nature of the optic nerve, and the existence of a posterior chamber. Though this model was a roughly correct modern model of the eye, it contained errors. Still, it was not advanced upon again until after Vesalius. A ciliary body was then discovered and the sclera, retina, choroid, and cornea were seen to meet at the same point. The two chambers were seen to hold the same fluid, as well as the lens being attached to the choroid. Galen continued the notion of a central canal, but he dissected the optic nerve and saw that it was solid. He mistakenly counted seven optical muscles, one too many. He also knew of the tear ducts.\n\nThe Indian surgeon Sushruta wrote \"Sushruta Samhita\" in Sanskrit in about 6th century which describes 76 ocular diseases (of these 51 surgical) as well as several ophthalmological surgical instruments and techniques. His description of cataract surgery was compatible with the method of couching. He has been described as one of the first cataract surgeons.\n\nMedieval Islamic Arabic and Persian scientists (unlike their classical predecessors) considered it normal to combine theory and practice, including the crafting of precise instruments, and therefore found it natural to combine the study of the eye with the practical application of that knowledge. Hunayn ibn Ishaq, and others beginning with the medieval Arabic period, taught that the crystalline lens is in the exact center of the eye. This idea was propagated until the end of the 1500s.\n\nIbn al-Haytham (Alhazen), in his Book of Optics explained that vision occurs when light bounces on an object and then is directed to one's eyes.\n\nIbn al-Nafis, an Arabic native of Damascus, wrote a large textbook, \"The Polished Book on Experimental Ophthalmology\", divided into two parts, \"On the Theory of Ophthalmology\" and \"Simple and Compounded Ophthalmic Drugs\".\n\nAvicenna wrote in his Canon \"rescheth\" which means \"retiformis\" and Gerard of Cremona\ntranslated this around 1150 into the new word \"retina\".\n\nIn the 17th and 18th centuries, hand lenses were used by Malpighi, and microscopes by Leeuwenhoek, preparations for fixing the eye for study by Ruysch, and later the freezing of the eye by Petit. This allowed for detailed study of the eye and an advanced model. Some mistakes persisted, such as: why the pupil changed size (seen to be vessels of the iris filling with blood), the existence of the posterior chamber, and the nature of the retina. Unaware of their functions, Leeuwenhoek noted the existence of photoreceptors, however, they were not properly discovered until Gottfried Reinhold Treviranus in 1834.\n\nGeorg Joseph Beer (1763–1821) was an Austrian ophthalmologist and leader of the First Viennese School of Medicine. He introduced a flap operation for treatment of cataract (Beer's operation), as well as popularizing the instrument used to perform the surgery (Beer's knife).\n\nIn North America, indigenous healers treated some eye diseases by rubbing or scraping the eyes or eyelids.\n\nThe first ophthalmic surgeon in Great Britain was John Freke, appointed to the position by the Governors of St Bartholomew's Hospital in 1727. A major breakthrough came with the appointment of Baron de Wenzel (1724–90), a German who became oculist to King George III of England in 1772. His skill at removing cataract legitimized the field. The first dedicated ophthalmic hospital opened in 1805 in London; it is now called Moorfields Eye Hospital. Clinical developments at Moorfields and the founding of the Institute of Ophthalmology (now part of the University College London) by Sir Stewart Duke-Elder established the site as the largest eye hospital in the world and a nexus for ophthalmic research.\n\nThe prominent opticians of the late 19th and early 20th centuries included Ernst Abbe (1840–1905), a co-owner of at the Zeiss Jena factories in Germany where he developed numerous optical instruments. Hermann von Helmholtz (1821-1894) was a polymath who made contributions to many fields of science and invented the ophthalmoscope in 1851. They both made theoretical calculations on image formation in optical systems and had also studied the optics of the eye. In Berlin, Albrecht von Graefe introduced iridectomy as a treatment for glaucoma and improved cataract surgery, he is also considered the founding father of the German Ophthalmological Society.\n\nNumerous ophthalmologists fled Germany after 1933 as the Nazis began to persecute those of Jewish descent. A representative leader was Joseph Igersheimer (1879–1965), best known for his discoveries with arsphenamine for the treatment of syphilis. He fled to Turkey in 1933. As one of eight emigrant directors in the Faculty of Medicine at the University of Istanbul, he built a modern clinic and trained students. In 1939, he went to the United States, becoming a professor at Tufts University. German ophthalmologist, Gerhard Meyer-Schwickerath is widely credited with developing the predecessor of laser coagulation, photocoagulation. In 1946, he conducted the first experiments on light coagulation. In 1949, he performed the first successful treatment of a retinal detachment with a light beam (light coagulation) by with a self-constructed device on the roof of the ophthalmic clinic at the University of Hamburg-Eppendorf.\n\nPolish ophthalmology dates to the 13th century. The Polish Ophthalmological Society was founded in 1911. A representative leader was Adam Zamenhof (1888–1940), who introduced certain diagnostic, surgical, and nonsurgical eye-care procedures and was shot by the Nazis in 1940. Zofia Falkowska (1915–93) head of the Faculty and Clinic of Ophthalmology in Warsaw from 1963 to 1976, was the first to use lasers in her practice.\n\nOphthalmologists are physicians (MD/DO in the US or MBBS in the UK and elsewhere or D.O./DOMS/ DNB, not OD or BOptom) who have completed a college degree, medical school, and residency in ophthalmology. Ophthalmology training equips eye specialists to provide the full spectrum of eye care, including the prescription of glasses and contact lenses, medical treatment, and complex microsurgery. In many countries, ophthalmologists also undergo additional specialized training in one of the many subspecialties. Ophthalmology was the first branch of medicine to offer board certification, now a standard practice among all specialties.\n\nIn Australia and New Zealand, the FRACO/FRANZCO is the equivalent postgraduate specialist qualification. It is a very competitive speciality to enter training and has a closely monitored and structured training system in place over the five years of postgraduate training. Overseas-trained ophthalmologists are assessed using the pathway published on the RANZCO website. Those who have completed their formal training in the UK and have the CCST/CCT are usually deemed to be comparable.\n\nIn Bangladesh to be an ophthalmologist the basic degree is an MBBS. Then they have to obtain a postgraduate degree or diploma in specialty ophthalmology. In Bangladesh, these are Diploma in Ophthalmology, Diploma in Community Ophthalmology, Fellow or Member of the College of Physicians and Surgeons in ophthalmology, and Master of Science in ophthalmology.\n\nIn Canada, an ophthalmology residency after medical school is undertaken. The residency lasts a minimum of five years after the MD degree which culminates in fellowship of the Royal College of Surgeons of Canada (FRCSC). Subspecialty training is undertaken by about 30% of fellows (FRCSC) in a variety of fields from anterior segment, cornea, glaucoma, vision rehabilitation, uveitis, oculoplastics, medical and surgical retina, ocular oncology, Ocular pathology, or neuro-ophthalmology. About 35 vacancies open per year for ophthalmology residency training in all of Canada. These numbers fluctuate per year, ranging from 30 to 37 spots. Of these, up to ten spots are at French-speaking universities in Quebec. At the end of the five years, the graduating ophthalmologist must pass the oral and written portions of the Royal College exam in either English or French.\n\nIn Finland, physicians willing to become ophthalmologists must undergo a five-year specialization which includes practical training and theoretical studies.\n\nIn India, after completing MBBS degree, postgraduate study in ophthalmology is required. The degrees are Doctor of Medicine, Master of Surgery, Diploma in Ophthalmic Medicine and Surgery, and Diplomate of National Board. The concurrent training and work experience is in the form of a junior residency at a medical college, eye hospital, or institution under the supervision of experienced faculty. Further work experience in form of fellowship, registrar, or senior resident refines the skills of these eye surgeons. All India Ophthalmologist Society and various state-level ophthalmologist societies hold regular conferences and actively promote continuing medical education.\n\nIn Nepal, to become an ophthalmologist, three years postgraduate study is required after completing MBBS degree. The postgraduate degree in ophthalmology is called MD in Ophthalmology. This degree is currently provided by Tilganga Institute of Ophthalmology, Tilganga, Kathmandu, BPKLCO, Institute of Medicine, TU, Kathmandu, BP Koirala Institute of Health Sciences, Dharan, Kathmandu University, Dhulikhel and National Academy of Medical Science, Kathmandu. Few Nepalese citizen also study this subject in Bangladesh, China, India, Pakistan and other countries. All the graduates have to pass Nepal Medical Council Licensing Exam to become a registered Ophthalmology in Nepal. The concurrent residency training is in the form of a PG student (resident) at a medical college, eye hospital, or institution according to the degree providing university's rules and regulations. Nepal Ophthalmic Society holds regular conferences and actively promote continuing medical education.\n\nIn Ireland, the Royal College of Surgeons of Ireland grants Membership (MRCSI (Ophth)) and Fellowship (FRCSI (Ophth)) qualifications in conjunction with the Irish College of Ophthalmologists. Total postgraduate training involves an intern year, a minimum of three years of basic surgical training and a further 4.5 years of higher surgical training. Clinical training takes place within public, Health Service Executive-funded hospitals in Dublin, Sligo, Limerick, Galway, Waterford, and Cork. A minimum of 8.5 years of training is required before eligibility to work in consultant posts. Some trainees take extra time to obtain MSc, MD or PhD degrees and to undertake clinical fellowships in the UK, Australia and the United States.\n\nIn Pakistan, after MBBS, a four-year full-time residency program leads to an exit-level FCPS examination in ophthalmology, held under the auspices of the College of Physicians and Surgeons, Pakistan. The tough examination is assessed by both highly qualified Pakistani and eminent international ophthalmic consultants. As a prerequisite to the final examinations, an intermediate module, an optics and refraction module, and a dissertation written on a research project carried out under supervision is also assessed.\nMoreover, a two-and-a-half-year residency program leads to an MCPS while a two-year training of DOMS is also being offered. For candidates in the military, a stringent two-year graded course, with quarterly assessments, is held under Armed Forces Post Graduate Medical Institute in Rawalpindi.\nThe M.S. in ophthalmology is also one of the specialty programs. In addition to programs for doctors, various diplomas and degrees for allied eyecare personnel are also being offered to produce competent optometrists, orthoptists, ophthalmic nurses, ophthalmic technologists, and ophthalmic technicians in this field. These programs are being offered notably by the College of Ophthalmology and Allied Vision Sciences in Lahore and the Pakistan Institute of Community Ophthalmology in Peshawar. Subspecialty fellowships are also being offered in the fields of pediatric ophthalmology and vitreoretinal ophthalmology. King Edward Medical University, Al Shifa Trust Eye Hospital Rawalpindi, and Al- Ibrahim Eye Hospital Karachi have also started a degree program in this field.\n\nOphthalmology is a considered a medical specialty that uses medicine and surgery to treat diseases of the eye. There is only one, duly recognized by the PMA and the PCS, professional organization in the country: the Philippine Academy of Ophthalmology (PAO). PAO and the state-standard Philippine Board of Ophthalmology (PBO) regulates ophthalmology residency programs and board certification. To become a general ophthalmologist in the Philippines, a candidate must have completed a Doctor of Medicine degree (MD) or its equivalent (e.g. MBBS), have completed an internship in Medicine, have passed the physician licensure exam, and completed residency training at a hospital accredited by the Philippine Board of Ophthalmology (accrediting arm of PAO). Attainment of board certification in ophthalmology from the PBO is essential in acquiring privileges in most major health institutions. Graduates of residency programs can receive further training in ophthalmology subspecialties, such as neuro-ophthalmology, retina, etc. by completing a fellowship program which varies in length depending on each program's requirements.\n\nIn the United Kingdom, three colleges grant postgraduate degrees in ophthalmology. The Royal College of Ophthalmologists (RCOphth) and the Royal College of Surgeons of Edinburgh grant MRCOphth/FRCOphth and MRCSEd/FRCSEd, (although membership is no longer a prerequisite for fellowship), the Royal College of Glasgow grants FRCS. Postgraduate work as a specialist registrar and one of these degrees is required for specialization in eye diseases. Such clinical work is within the NHS, with supplementary private work for some consultants.\nOnly 2.3 ophthalmologists exist per 100,000 population in the UK – fewer \"pro rata\" than in any other nation in the European Union.\n\nIn the United States, ophthalmologists must complete four years of undergraduate studies, four years of medical school, one year medical or general surgical residency, three years of ophthalmology residency and optional one to two years of speciality training. Ophthalmologists are Doctors of Medicine that specialize in the eye and related structures. They perform medical and surgical eye care and can also write prescriptions for corrective lenses (glasses and contacts). They often deal with advanced forms of eye disease in patients with significant systemic illness. \nPhysicians must complete the requirements of continuing medical education to maintain licensure and for recertification. Professional bodies like the American Academy of Ophthalmology and American Society of Cataract and Refractive Surgery organize conferences, help physician members through continuing medical education programs for maintaining board certification, and provide political advocacy and peer support.\n\nThe following is a list of physicians who have significantly contributed to the field of Ophthalmology:\n\n\n\n\n"}

Transplantation is the process of transplanting the organs donated into another person. This process extends the life expectancy of a person suffering from organ failure. Unfortunately the number of patients requiring organ transplants outweighs the number of donor organs available.\n\nAustralia's first organ transplants were corneal transplants in the early 1940s. Following in chronological order are monumental first in Australia's organ transplantation history.\nThe following table (Table 1.1) shows the global transplantation milestones in chronological order.\n\n\"Table 1.1 Source: Australian Government Tissue Donation and Transplantation Authority. http://www.donatelife.gov.au\"\n\nThere are two types of donors; living donors and deceased donors.\n\nIn Australia the most common living donations not including blood donations are kidneys and bone marrow. The tissues and organs that are able to be donated by a living donor are:\n\nThe minimum age for living donation is 18 years of age. A person may be eligible to be a donor if they are free from HIV, cancer, systemic infection, sickle cell anaemia, creutzfeldt-jakob disease and they are not a previous IV drug user.\n\nDonation to a family member is a common scenario. The reasons for a family member to want to be a living donor to their relatives are; a desire to help, self benefit (from loved ones improved health), a feeling of moral duty, pressure identification with the recipient, increased self esteem from doing a good deed. It is the health professional's role to understand the difficulty of these situations involving relationships of loved friends or relatives and they are to determine whether or not the offer of donation is genuine or the living donor feels pressured into donating because of the seriousness of their loved ones organ failure. However most donations result in a positive psychological benefit to both the donor and recipient.\n\nIf a donor is wanting to donate to someone who is not a relative or friend they are intensively psychologically tested to determine their motives and suitability for donation as there can occasionally be harmful motives such as attention seeking or mental illness.\n\nDeceased donors have been declared dead and are maintained in ICU on ventilators so tissue oxygenation continues until the procedure of organ retrieval and cold preservation.\n\nDeceased donors are divided into two sub-classes.\nBoth types of deceased donors have complete and irreversible damage and returning to life is impossible. Thorough testing is carried out prior to confirming a person brain dead or cardiac dead.\n\nOne deceased donor is able to save up to ten lives by donating the following:\n\nAfter death some people choose to donate their bodies to science. These bodies are used in many teaching facilities and aid in teaching anatomy, surgical techniques or research. Whole body donation involves the deceased person contacting the university or teaching institution prior to death to obtain consent and cover the legalities involved. After death it is up to the family of the deceased to contact the chosen facility and arrange donation.\n\nCurrently Australia's organ donation system is 'opt-in'. This means a person had to give consent (opt-in) in be a donor prior to their death, or their family can make the decision for them if they are considered a viable donor. The 'opt-out' system is used in several countries around the world. For this system everyone is placed on the donor list and must 'opt-out' if they do not wish to donate their organs. Whether Australia changes to the 'opt-out' system is constantly coming into question. In a discussion paper compiled in 2011 it was stated 35% of family members of a potential donor would refuse donation if they were unsure of the family members intentions on donating. However, if an 'opt-out' system was put into place and the potential donor did not opt-out prior to death, it was estimated only 20% of families would refuse donation.\n\nA study carried out in 2002 investigated donor rates of countries with 'opt-in' and 'opt-out' systems. The countries chosen for the study were ones that had relatively similar backgrounds and health systems. After the donation rates were calculated to match the mortality rates it concluded the difference in donor rates between the two systems were marginal. The results as follows (Table 1.2).\n\n Table 1.2 Source: Coppen, R., Friele, R.D., Marquet, R.L. and Gevers, S.K.M. (2005). Opting-out systems:no guarantee for higher donation rates. \"Transplant International\", 18: 1275-1279. Doi: 10.1111/j.1432-2277.2005.00202.x \nThere are many pros and cons for each of the two systems thus making it a controversial topic and as seen above some studies can be contradicting. Ultimately it is the family of the deceased who will make the final decision on organ donation. Only 57% of Australians know the wishes of their family members in regards to organ donation, which has a large impact on families giving consent for organ donation. Donation cannot go ahead without families consent even if the person is on the donor register.\n\nIn most cases religions support organ donation. There are a few aspects of each religion that make the logistics of organ donation difficult however most of these can be overcome in some way.\n\nMost organ donations in predominately Muslim countries are live donations, for example in Iran in 2006 only 13% of renal transplants were from deceased donation. In Islamic religion, violating the human body whether living or dead is forbidden, this includes organ donation. However, saving a life is ranked extremely highly in the Qur'an. Brain stem death (brain dead) is controversial in Islamic religion. This, along with burial customs of Muslims being they have to be buried within 24 hours of death makes if difficult for organ donation.\n\nGenerally Christianity approves of organ donation although some Christians believe principle healing is achieved through prayer. The majority of Christians see organ donation as Christian love or an act of devotion to God and mankind.\n\nThe Jewish faith places great significance on avoiding unnecessary interference with cadavers and receiving benefit from a cadaver is prohibited. The body must also be buried within 24 hours of death. It is custom in Judaism to not interfere with death; organ donation procedures may be part of this. Only 8% of the Israel population are registered organ donors.\n\nHindu's believe in reincarnation and the good deeds of one's current lifetime will determine the fate of the next lifetime. Organ donation is seen as a good deed. Hasmukh Velji Shah of the World Council of Hindus stated \"The import issue for Hindu is that which sustains life should be accepted and promoted as Dharma (righteous living). Organ donation is an integral part of our living.\"\n\nBuddhists believe in rebirth. Brain death is also controversial for Buddhists as they believe the spirit remains in the body days after death and interfering with the body may affect a person's next rebirth. However selfless giving is integral to Buddhism therefore organ donation is up to the individual.\n\nAustralian donor rates are on the rise. Between 2009 and 2013, donor numbers increased by 29%. In 2009 there were 11.4 donors per million of the population. By 2013 there were 16.9 donors per million of the population. (Table 1.3). In Australia around 1600 people are on the organ transplant waiting list at any time. Less than 1% of persons whose death is in hospital can be potential donors because of the limited circumstances for which organ donation is possible. In 2013 only 40% of patients on the organ wait list received a transplant and 2% of the patients on the waiting list died while waiting for an organ.\n\n \"Table 1.3 source: Australian Government Organ and Tissue Donation and Transplantation Authority (2014). Annual Report.\"\n\n \"Table 1.4 Source: Australian Government Organ and Tissue and Transplantation Authority (2014). Facts and Statistics.\"\n\nThe Australian Organ Donor Register is a government register. People can register to be organ donors or they can register that they wish to not be an organ donor. The register is nationwide and is the only register in Australia. Registering is simple and can be done online at the Donate Life website.\n"}

It is located about three blocks northwest of the Porta Venezia. Its present situation, amidst crowded 19th and 20th century apartment blocks, has little relationship to its original placement, in the central park of a massive rectangular cloister-like 15th-century leprosarium (Lazaretto). The church, once called \"Tempietto di Santa Maria della Sanità\" or \"San Carlino\", escaped the late-nineteenth century demolition of the Lazzaretto.\n\nThe Lazzaretto of Milan was a quadrangle with 400 yard long sides, designed by Lazzaro Palazzi in the late 15th century. It was located outside the city walls and Porta Orientale. In the center an altar had been placed in the open ground. After the Lazzaretto was used for housing the ill during the plague epidemic of 1576, the archbishop Carlo Borromeo commissioned a new church from Pellegrino Tibaldi. Construction from 1558 to 1592, erected this centralized church with open circumferential arches which allowed the ill to see services from all corners of the surrounding porticos. After the French occupation of the Duchy, the lazzaretto was used as barracks. During the Cisalpine Republic, the architect Giuseppe Piermarini was commissioned to transform the church into a secular Temple of the Nation (\"Tempio della Patria\"). Piermarini Demolished the cupola, and walled the sides, but reconstruction soon ceased. During the 19th century, the central fields of the Lazzaretto were used for agriculture, and the surrounding cloister was used by peasants. In the late 19th century, the Lazaretto buildings were nearly entirely demolished, and the church was reconsecrated by 1884, with a new dome and an added facade portico.\n\nThe church is the backdrop for a scene at the end of the Manzoni novel \"I Promessi Sposi\".\n\nBecause of the vibrations produced by the underground train under viale Tunisia which have damaged the dome the church has been subject to studies to reinforce its structure. After a failed fund raising for restoration among the public the church has been completely restored by Rocca Foundation in memory of Roberto Rocca. The goal was to use the church both for religious activities and as a concert hall. For this goal the rooms added at the end of 1800 for the sacristy and the priest house on the northern side have been transformed to host concert players. The altar has been moved towards the wall to have more space for concerts. \n\nWork begun in September 2015 was completed in June 2017. The architectural design was by Studio 02 Arch, the static consolidation has been followed by Studio Associato Brambilla Ferrari and restoration was undertaken by Naos Restauri. \nA new organ has been installed with 1800 pipes, designed by Martino Lurani Cernuschi with a romantic-synphonic approach. The church was inaugurated by Milan archbishop Mario Delpini on 3 November 2017 at 8.30 pm.\n\nThe church is open every day from 9 to 12 am, masses are organized Wednesday and Friday at 10 am.\n\nThe municipality has completed in 2016 a project to reserve to pedestrians Largo Bellintani around the church. The project is from arch. Loredana Brambilla of Milan Municipality.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "414144", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=414144", "title": "Sterilization (microbiology)", "text": "Sterilization (microbiology)\n\nSterilization (or sterilization) refers to any process that eliminates, removes, kills, or deactivates all forms of life and other biological agents (such as fungi, bacteria, viruses, spore forms, prions, unicellular eukaryotic organisms such as Plasmodium, etc.) present in a specified region, such as a surface, a volume of fluid, medication, or in a compound such as biological culture media. Sterilization can be achieved through various means, including: heat, chemicals, irradiation, high pressure, and filtration. Sterilization is not distinct from disinfection, sanitization, and pasteurization, in that sterilization kills, deactivates, or eliminates all forms of life and other biological agents which are present.\n\nOne of the first steps toward sterilization was made by Nicolas Appert who discovered that thorough application of heat over a suitable period slowed the decay of foods and various liquids, preserving them for safe consumption for a longer time than was typical. Canning of foods is an extension of the same principle and has helped to reduce food borne illness (\"food poisoning\"). Other methods of sterilizing foods include food irradiation and high pressure (pascalization).\n\nIn general, surgical instruments and medications that enter an already aseptic part of the body (such as the bloodstream, or penetrating the skin) must be sterile. Examples of such instruments include scalpels, hypodermic needles, and artificial pacemakers. This is also essential in the manufacture of parenteral pharmaceuticals.\n\nPreparation of injectable medications and intravenous solutions for fluid replacement therapy requires not only sterility but also well-designed containers to prevent entry of adventitious agents after initial product sterilization.\n\nMost medical and surgical devices used in healthcare facilities are made of materials that are able to go under steam sterilization. However, since 1950, there has been an increase in medical devices and instruments made of materials (e.g., plastics) that require low-temperature sterilization. Ethylene oxide gas has been used since the 1950s for heat- and moisture-sensitive medical devices. Within the past 15 years, a number of new, low-temperature sterilization systems (e.g., vaporized hydrogen peroxide, peracetic acid immersion, ozone) have been developed and are being used to sterilize medical devices.\n\nSteam sterilization is the most widely used and the most dependable. Steam sterilization is nontoxic, inexpensive, rapidly microbicidal, sporicidal, and rapidly heats and penetrates fabrics.\n\nThere are strict international rules to protect the contamination of Solar System bodies from biological material from Earth. Standards vary depending on both the type of mission and its destination; the more likely a planet is considered to be habitable, the stricter the requirements are.\n\nMany components of instruments used on spacecraft cannot withstand very high temperatures, so techniques not requiring excessive temperatures are used as tolerated, including heating to at least , chemical sterilization, oxidization, ultraviolet, and irradiation.\n\nThe aim of sterilization is the reduction of initially present microorganisms or other potential pathogens. The degree of sterilization is commonly expressed by multiples of the decimal reduction time, or D-value, denoting the time needed to reduce the initial number formula_1 to one tenth (formula_2) of its original value. Then the number of microorganisms formula_3 after sterilization time formula_4 is given by:\nThe D-value is a function of sterilization conditions and varies with the type of microorganism, temperature, water activity, pH etc.. For steam sterilization (see below) typically the temperature, in degrees Celsius, is given as an index.\n\nTheoretically, the likelihood of the survival of an individual microorganism is never zero. To compensate for this, the overkill method is often used. Using the overkill method, sterilization is performed by sterilizing for longer than is required to kill the bioburden present on or in the item being sterilized. This provides a sterility assurance level (SAL) equal to the probability of a non-sterile unit.\n\nFor high-risk applications, such as medical devices and injections, a sterility assurance level of at least 10 is required by the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA).\n\nA widely used method for heat sterilization is the autoclave, sometimes called a converter or steam sterilizer. Autoclaves use steam heated to under pressure. To achieve sterility, the article is placed in a chamber and heated by injected steam until the article reaches a temperature and time setpoint. Almost all the air is removed from the chamber, because air is undesired in the moist heat sterilization process (this is one trait that differs from a typical pressure cooker used for food cooking). The article is held at the temperature setpoint for a period of time which varies depending on what bioburden is present on the article being sterilized and its resistance (D-value) to steam sterilization. A general cycle would be anywhere between 3 and 15 minutes, (depending on the generated heat) at at , which is sufficient to provide a sterility assurance level of 10 for a product with a bioburden of 10 and a D-value of 2.0 minutes. Following sterilization, liquids in a pressurized autoclave must be cooled slowly to avoid boiling over when the pressure is released. This may be achieved by gradually depressurizing the sterilization chamber and allowing liquids to evaporate under a negative pressure, while cooling the contents.\n\nProper autoclave treatment will inactivate all resistant bacterial spores in addition to fungi, bacteria, and viruses, but is not expected to eliminate all prions, which vary in their resistance. For prion elimination, various recommendations state for 60 minutes or for at least 18 minutes. The 263K scrapie prion is inactivated relatively quickly by such sterilization procedures; however, other strains of scrapie, and strains of Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CKD) and bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE) are more resistant. Using mice as test animals, one experiment showed that heating BSE positive brain tissue at for 18 minutes resulted in only a 2.5 log decrease in prion infectivity.\n\nMost autoclaves have meters and charts that record or display information, particularly temperature and pressure as a function of time. The information is checked to ensure that the conditions required for sterilization have been met. Indicator tape is often placed on the packages of products prior to autoclaving, and some packaging incorporates indicators. The indicator changes color when exposed to steam, providing a visual confirmation.\n\nBioindicators can also be used to independently confirm autoclave performance. Simple bioindicator devices are commercially available, based on microbial spores. Most contain spores of the heat-resistant microbe \"Geobacillus stearothermophilus\" (formerly \"Bacillus stearothermophilus\"), which is extremely resistant to steam sterilization. Biological indicators may take the form of glass vials of spores and liquid media, or as spores on strips of paper inside glassine envelopes. These indicators are placed in locations where it is difficult for steam to reach to verify that steam is penetrating there.\n\nFor autoclaving, cleaning is critical. Extraneous biological matter or grime may shield organisms from steam penetration. Proper cleaning can be achieved through physical scrubbing, sonication, ultrasound, or pulsed air.\n\nPressure cooking and canning is analogous to autoclaving, and when performed correctly renders food sterile.\n\nMoist heat causes the destruction of microorganisms by denaturation of macromolecules, primarily proteins. This method is a faster process than dry heat sterilization.\n\nDry heat was the first method of sterilization and is a longer process than moist heat sterilization. The destruction of microorganisms through the use of dry heat is a gradual phenomenon. With longer exposure to lethal temperatures, the number of killed microorganisms increases. Forced ventilation of hot air can be used to increase the rate at which heat is transferred to an organism and reduce the temperature and amount of time needed to achieve sterility. At higher temperatures, shorter exposure times are required to kill organisms. This can reduce heat-induced damage to food products.\nThe standard setting for a hot air oven is at least two hours at . A rapid method heats air to for 6 minutes for unwrapped objects and 12 minutes for wrapped objects. Dry heat has the advantage that it can be used on powders and other heat-stable items that are adversely affected by steam (e.g. it does not cause rusting of steel objects).\n\nFlaming is done to inoculation loops and straight-wires in microbiology labs for streaking. Leaving the loop in the flame of a Bunsen burner or alcohol burner until it glows red ensures that any infectious agent is inactivated. This is commonly used for small metal or glass objects, but not for large objects (see Incineration below). However, during the initial heating, infectious material may be sprayed from the wire surface before it is killed, contaminating nearby surfaces and objects. Therefore, special heaters have been developed that surround the inoculating loop with a heated cage, ensuring that such sprayed material does not further contaminate the area. Another problem is that gas flames may leave carbon or other residues on the object if the object is not heated enough. A variation on flaming is to dip the object in a 70% or more concentrated solution of ethanol, then briefly touch the object to a Bunsen burner flame. The ethanol will ignite and burn off rapidly, leaving less residue than a gas flame.\n\nIncineration is a waste treatment process that involves the combustion of organic substances contained in waste materials. This method also burns any organism to ash. It is used to sterilize medical and other biohazardous waste before it is discarded with non-hazardous waste. Bacteria incinerators are mini furnaces that incinerate and kill off any microorganisms that may be on an inoculating loop or wire.\n\nNamed after John Tyndall, Tyndallization is an obsolete and lengthy process designed to reduce the level of activity of sporulating bacteria that are left by a simple boiling water method. The process involves boiling for a period (typically 20 minutes) at atmospheric pressure, cooling, incubating for a day, and then repeating the process a total of three to four times. The incubation periods are to allow heat-resistant spores surviving the previous boiling period to germinate to form the heat-sensitive vegetative (growing) stage, which can be killed by the next boiling step. This is effective because many spores are stimulated to grow by the heat shock. The procedure only works for media that can support bacterial growth, and will not sterilize non-nutritive substrates like water. Tyndallization is also ineffective against prions.\n\nGlass bead sterilizers work by heating glass beads to . Instruments are then quickly doused in these glass beads, which heat the object while physically scraping contaminants off their surface. Glass bead sterilizers were once a common sterilization method employed in dental offices as well as biological laboratories, but are not approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) to be used as a sterilizers since 1997. They are still popular in European and Israeli dental practices, although there are no current evidence-based guidelines for using this sterilizer.\n\nChemicals are also used for sterilization. Heating provides a reliable way to rid objects of all transmissible agents, but it is not always appropriate if it will damage heat-sensitive materials such as biological materials, fiber optics, electronics, and many plastics. In these situations chemicals, either in a gaseous or liquid form, can be used as sterilants. While the use of gas and liquid chemical sterilants avoids the problem of heat damage, users must ensure that the article to be sterilized is chemically compatible with the sterilant being used. In addition, the use of chemical sterilants poses new challenges for workplace safety, as the properties that make chemicals effective sterilants usually make them harmful to humans.\n\nEthylene oxide (EO, EtO) gas treatment is one of the common methods used to sterilize, pasteurize, or disinfect items because of its wide range of material compatibility. It is also used to process items that are sensitive to processing with other methods, such as radiation (gamma, electron beam, X-ray), heat (moist or dry), or other chemicals. Ethylene oxide treatment is the most common chemical sterilization method, used for approximately 70% of total sterilizations, and for over 50% of all disposable medical devices.\n\nEthylene oxide treatment is generally carried out between with relative humidity above 30% and a gas concentration between 200 and 800 mg/l. Typically, the process lasts for several hours. Ethylene oxide is highly effective, as it penetrates all porous materials, and it can penetrate through some plastic materials and films. Ethylene oxide kills all known microorganisms, such as bacteria (including spores), viruses, and fungi (including yeasts and moulds), and is compatible with almost all materials even when repeatedly applied. It is flammable, toxic, and carcinogenic; however, only with a reported potential for some adverse health effects when not used in compliance with published requirements. Ethylene oxide sterilizers and processes require biological validation after sterilizer installation, significant repairs or process changes.\n\nThe traditional process consists of a preconditioning phase (in a separate room or cell), a processing phase (more commonly in a vacuum vessel and sometimes in a pressure rated vessel), and an aeration phase (in a separate room or cell) to remove EO residues and lower by-products such as ethylene chlorohydrin (EC or ECH) and, of lesser importance, ethylene glycol (EG). An alternative process, known as all-in-one processing, also exists for some products whereby all three phases are performed in the vacuum or pressure rated vessel. This latter option can facilitate faster overall processing time and residue dissipation.\n\nThe most common EO processing method is the gas chamber method. To benefit from economies of scale, EO has traditionally been delivered by filling a large chamber with a combination of gaseous EO either as pure EO, or with other gases used as diluents; diluents include chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs), hydrochlorofluorocarbons (HCFCs), and carbon dioxide.\n\nEthylene oxide is still widely used by medical device manufacturers. Since EO is explosive at concentrations above 3%, EO was traditionally supplied with an inert carrier gas, such as a CFC or HCFC. The use of CFCs or HCFCs as the carrier gas was banned because of concerns of ozone depletion. These halogenated hydrocarbons are being replaced by systems using 100% EO, because of regulations and the high cost of the blends. In hospitals, most EO sterilizers use single-use cartridges because of the convenience and ease of use compared to the former plumbed gas cylinders of EO blends.\n\nIt is important to adhere to patient and healthcare personnel government specified limits of EO residues in and/or on processed products, operator exposure after processing, during storage and handling of EO gas cylinders, and environmental emissions produced when using EO.\n\nThe U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) has set the permissible exposure limit (PEL) at 1 ppm – calculated as an eight-hour time-weighted average (TWA) – and 5 ppm as a 15-minute excursion limit (EL). The National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health's (NIOSH) immediately dangerous to life and health limit (IDLH) for EO is 800 ppm. The odor threshold is around 500 ppm, so EO is imperceptible until concentrations are well above the OSHA PEL. Therefore, OSHA recommends that continuous gas monitoring systems be used to protect workers using EO for processing.\n\nNitrogen dioxide (NO) gas is a rapid and effective sterilant for use against a wide range of microorganisms, including common bacteria, viruses, and spores. The unique physical properties of NO gas allow for sterilant dispersion in an enclosed environment at room temperature and atmospheric pressure. The mechanism for lethality is the degradation of DNA in the spore core through nitration of the phosphate backbone, which kills the exposed organism as it absorbs NO. This degradation occurs at even very low concentrations of the gas. NO has a boiling point of at sea level, which results in a relatively highly saturated vapour pressure at ambient temperature. Because of this, liquid NO may be used as a convenient source for the sterilant gas. Liquid NO is often referred to by the name of its dimer, dinitrogen tetroxide (NO). Additionally, the low levels of concentration required, coupled with the high vapour pressure, assures that no condensation occurs on the devices being sterilized. This means that no aeration of the devices is required immediately following the sterilization cycle. NO is also less corrosive than other sterilant gases, and is compatible with most medical materials and adhesives.\n\nThe most-resistant organism (MRO) to sterilization with NO gas is the spore of \"Geobacillus stearothermophilus\", which is the same MRO for both steam and hydrogen peroxide sterilization processes. The spore form of \"G. stearothermophilus\" has been well characterized over the years as a biological indicator in sterilization applications. Microbial inactivation of \"G. stearothermophilus\" with NO gas proceeds rapidly in a log-linear fashion, as is typical of other sterilization processes. Noxilizer, Inc. has commercialized this technology to offer contract sterilization services for medical devices at its Baltimore, Maryland (U.S.) facility. This has been demonstrated in Noxilizer’s lab in multiple studies and is supported by published reports from other labs. These same properties also allow for quicker removal of the sterilant and residual gases through aeration of the enclosed environment. The combination of rapid lethality and easy removal of the gas allows for shorter overall cycle times during the sterilization (or decontamination) process and a lower level of sterilant residuals than are found with other sterilization methods.\n\nOzone is used in industrial settings to sterilize water and air, as well as a disinfectant for surfaces. It has the benefit of being able to oxidize most organic matter. On the other hand, it is a toxic and unstable gas that must be produced on-site, so it is not practical to use in many settings.\n\nOzone offers many advantages as a sterilant gas; ozone is a very efficient sterilant because of its strong oxidizing properties (E=2.076 vs SHE) capable of destroying a wide range of pathogens, including prions, without the need for handling hazardous chemicals since the ozone is generated within the sterilizer from medical-grade oxygen. The high reactivity of ozone means that waste ozone can be destroyed by passing over a simple catalyst that reverts it to oxygen and ensures that the cycle time is relatively short. The disadvantage of using ozone is that the gas is very reactive and very hazardous. The NIOSH's immediately dangerous to life and health limit (IDLH) for ozone is smaller than the IDLH for ethylene oxide. NIOSH and OSHA has set the PEL for ozone at , calculated as an time-weighted average. The sterilant gas manufacturers include many safety features in their products but prudent practice is to provide continuous monitoring of exposure to ozone, in order to provide a rapid warning in the event of a leak. Monitors for determining workplace exposure to ozone are commercially available.\n\nGlutaraldehyde and formaldehyde solutions (also used as fixatives) are accepted liquid sterilizing agents, provided that the immersion time is sufficiently long. To kill all spores in a clear liquid can take up to 22 hours with glutaraldehyde and even longer with formaldehyde. The presence of solid particles may lengthen the required period or render the treatment ineffective. Sterilization of blocks of tissue can take much longer, due to the time required for the fixative to penetrate. Glutaraldehyde and formaldehyde are volatile, and toxic by both skin contact and inhalation. Glutaraldehyde has a short shelf-life (<2 weeks), and is expensive. Formaldehyde is less expensive and has a much longer shelf-life if some methanol is added to inhibit polymerization to paraformaldehyde, but is much more volatile. Formaldehyde is also used as a gaseous sterilizing agent; in this case, it is prepared on-site by depolymerization of solid paraformaldehyde. Many vaccines, such as the original Salk polio vaccine, are sterilized with formaldehyde.\n\nHydrogen peroxide, in both liquid and as vaporized hydrogen peroxide (VHP), is another chemical sterilizing agent. Hydrogen peroxide is a strong oxidant, which allows it to destroy a wide range of pathogens. Hydrogen peroxide is used to sterilize heat- or temperature-sensitive articles, such as rigid endoscopes. In medical sterilization, hydrogen peroxide is used at higher concentrations, ranging from around 35% up to 90%. The biggest advantage of hydrogen peroxide as a sterilant is the short cycle time. Whereas the cycle time for ethylene oxide may be 10 to 15 hours, some modern hydrogen peroxide sterilizers have a cycle time as short as 28 minutes.\n\nDrawbacks of hydrogen peroxide include material compatibility, a lower capability for penetration and operator health risks. Products containing cellulose, such as paper, cannot be sterilized using VHP and products containing nylon may become brittle. The penetrating ability of hydrogen peroxide is not as good as ethylene oxide and so there are limitations on the length and diameter of the lumen of objects that can be effectively sterilized. Hydrogen peroxide is a primary irritant and the contact of the liquid solution with skin will cause bleaching or ulceration depending on the concentration and contact time. It is relatively non-toxic when diluted to low concentrations, but is a dangerous oxidizer at high concentrations (> 10% w/w). The vapour is also hazardous, primarily affecting the eyes and respiratory system. Even short term exposures can be hazardous and NIOSH has set the IDLH at 75 ppm, less than one tenth the IDLH for ethylene oxide (800 ppm). Prolonged exposure to lower concentrations can cause permanent lung damage and consequently, OSHA has set the permissible exposure limit to 1.0 ppm, calculated as an eight-hour time-weighted average. Sterilizer manufacturers go to great lengths to make their products safe through careful design and incorporation of many safety features, though there are still workplace exposures of hydrogen peroxide from gas sterilizers documented in the FDA MAUDE database. When using any type of gas sterilizer, prudent work practices should include good ventilation, a continuous gas monitor for hydrogen peroxide and good work practices and training.\n\nVaporized hydrogen peroxide (VHP) is used to sterilize large enclosed and sealed areas, such as entire rooms and aircraft interiors.\n\nAlthough toxic, VHP breaks down in a short time to water and oxygen.\n\nPeracetic acid (0.2%) is a recognized sterilant by the FDA for use in sterilizing medical devices such as endoscopes.\n\nPrions are highly resistant to chemical sterilization. Treatment with aldehydes, such as formaldehyde, have actually been shown to increase prion resistance. Hydrogen peroxide (3%) for one hour was shown to be ineffective, providing less than 3 logs (10) reduction in contamination. Iodine, formaldehyde, glutaraldehyde, and peracetic acid also fail this test (one hour treatment). Only chlorine, phenolic compounds, guanidinium thiocyanate, and sodium hydroxide reduce prion levels by more than 4 logs; chlorine (too corrosive to use on certain objects) and sodium hydroxide are the most consistent. Many studies have shown the effectiveness of sodium hydroxide.\n\nSterilization can be achieved using electromagnetic radiation, such as electron beams, X-rays, gamma rays, or irradiation by subatomic particles. Electromagnetic or particulate radiation can be energetic enough to ionize atoms or molecules (ionizing radiation), or less energetic (non-ionizing radiation).\n\nUltraviolet light irradiation (UV, from a germicidal lamp) is useful for sterilization of surfaces and some transparent objects. Many objects that are transparent to visible light absorb UV. UV irradiation is routinely used to sterilize the interiors of biological safety cabinets between uses, but is ineffective in shaded areas, including areas under dirt (which may become polymerized after prolonged irradiation, so that it is very difficult to remove). It also damages some plastics, such as polystyrene foam if exposed for prolonged periods of time.\nThe safety of irradiation facilities is regulated by the United Nations International Atomic Energy Agency and monitored by the different national Nuclear Regulatory Commissions (NRC). The radiation exposure accidents that have occurred in the past are documented by the agency and thoroughly analyzed to determine the cause and improvement potential. Such improvements are then mandated to retrofit existing facilities and future design.\n\nGamma radiation is very penetrating, and is commonly used for sterilization of disposable medical equipment, such as syringes, needles, cannulas and IV sets, and food. It is emitted by a radioisotope, usually cobalt-60 (Co) or caesium-137 (Cs), which have photon energies of up to 1.3 and 0.66 MeV, respectively.\n\nUse of a radioisotope requires shielding for the safety of the operators while in use and in storage. With most designs, the radioisotope is lowered into a water-filled source storage pool, which absorbs radiation and allows maintenance personnel to enter the radiation shield. One variant keeps the radioisotope under water at all times and lowers the product to be irradiated in the water in hermetically-sealed bells; no further shielding is required for such designs. Other uncommonly used designs use dry storage, providing movable shields that reduce radiation levels in areas of the irradiation chamber. An incident in Decatur, Georgia, US, where water-soluble caesium-137 leaked into the source storage pool, requiring NRC intervention has led to use of this radioisotope being almost entirely discontinued in favour of the more costly, non-water-soluble cobalt-60. Cobalt-60 gamma photons have about twice the energy, and hence greater penetrating range, of caesium-137-produced radiation.\n\nElectron beam processing is also commonly used for sterilization. Electron beams use an on-off technology and provide a much higher dosing rate than gamma or X-rays. Due to the higher dose rate, less exposure time is needed and thereby any potential degradation to polymers is reduced. Because electrons carry a charge, electron beams are less penetrating than both gamma and X-rays. Facilities rely on substantial concrete shields to protect workers and the environment from radiation exposure.\n\nHigh-energy X-rays (produced by bremsstrahlung) allow irradiation of large packages and pallet loads of medical devices. They are sufficiently penetrating to treat multiple pallet loads of low-density packages with very good dose uniformity ratios. X-ray sterilization does not require chemical or radioactive material: high-energy X-rays are generated at high intensity by an X-ray generator that does not require shielding when not in use. X-rays are generated by bombarding a dense material (target) such as tantalum or tungsten with high-energy electrons, in a process known as bremsstrahlung conversion. These systems are energy-inefficient, requiring much more electrical energy than other systems for the same result.\n\nIrradiation with X-rays, gamma rays, or electrons does not make materials radioactive, because the energy used is too low. Generally an energy of at least 10 MeV is needed to induce radioactivity in a material. Neutrons and very high-energy particles can make materials radioactive, but have good penetration, whereas lower energy particles (other than neutrons) cannot make materials radioactive, but have poorer penetration.\n\nSterilization by irradiation with gamma rays may however affect material properties.\n\nIrradiation is used by the United States Postal Service to sterilize mail in the Washington, D.C. area. Some foods (e.g. spices and ground meats) are sterilized by irradiation.\n\nSubatomic particles may be more or less penetrating and may be generated by a radioisotope or a device, depending upon the type of particle.\n\nFluids that would be damaged by heat, irradiation or chemical sterilization, such as drug products, can be sterilized by microfiltration using membrane filters. This method is commonly used for heat labile pharmaceuticals and protein solutions in medicinal drug processing. A microfilter with pore size 0.2 µm will usually effectively remove microorganisms. Some staphylococcal species have, however, been shown to be flexible enough to pass through 0.22 µm filters. In the processing of biologics, viruses must be removed or inactivated, requiring the use of nanofilters with a smaller pore size (20–50 nm) are used. Smaller pore sizes lower the flow rate, so in order to achieve higher total throughput or to avoid premature blockage, pre-filters might be used to protect small pore membrane filters. Tangential flow filtration (TFF) and alternating tangential flow (ATF) systems also reduce particulate accumulation and blockage.\n\nMembrane filters used in production processes are commonly made from materials such as mixed cellulose ester or polyethersulfone (PES). The filtration equipment and the filters themselves may be purchased as pre-sterilized disposable units in sealed packaging or must be sterilized by the user, generally by autoclaving at a temperature that does not damage the fragile filter membranes. To ensure proper functioning of the filter, the membrane filters are integrity tested post-use and sometimes before use. The nondestructive integrity test assures the filter is undamaged and is a regulatory requirement. Typically, terminal pharmaceutical sterile filtration is performed inside of a cleanroom to prevent contamination.\n\nInstruments that have undergone sterilization can be maintained in such condition by containment in sealed packaging until use.\n\nAseptic technique is the act of maintaining sterility during procedures.\n\n\n"}

It is the traditional and indigenous drink of the Limbu people of eastern Nepal.\nTongba is culturally and religiously important to the Limbu people of eastern Nepal. Taplejung is the ultimate destination for drinking Tongba. Offering Tongba is respect to a guest in Limbu people and also must-have drinks in occasions and festivals.\nTongba actually is the vessel which holds the fermented millet beverage known as mandokpenaa thee. Mandokpenaa thee is prepared by cooking and fermenting whole grain millet. The cooked millet is cooled and mixed with khesung (which is a source of molds, bacteria and yeast). Then the mass is collected and placed in a woven bamboo basket lined with green leaves or plastic, covered with thick fold of cloth and allowed to remain in a warm place for 1–2 days depending upon the temperature. The sweet mass is then packed tightly into an earthenware pot or plastic jars and the opening is usually sealed off to prevent air from entering. After 7–15 days also depending upon the temperature, the fermentation is complete and the mass is converted to mandokpenaa thee.\n\nThe time mandokpenaa thee is left to remain undisturbed in the pot after completion of fermentation leads to maturing of the mandokpenaa thee. During the maturing the flavours and taste intensifies yet become more mellowed. Traditionally, it is stored for about six months.\n\nIt is consumed in a unique way: the fermented millet is put in a container, also traditionally called a Tongba, and boiled water is poured in it to the brim. It is then left undisturbed for about five minutes. Once the five minutes has passed it is ready to drink. A fine bamboo straw with a blind end, but perforated on the side to act as a filter, is inserted into the container to suck out the warm water and alcohol from the millet grains. More hot water is added as the tongba becomes dry, and the process is repeated until the alcohol is exhausted.\n\n"}

The Library is a part of the larger UCSF Industry Documents Library which also includes the Drug Industry Document Archive. TTID contains over 14 million documents produced by major tobacco companies and organizations, many of them internal strategic memoranda made public as a consequence of the Tobacco Master Settlement Agreement. The documents deal with the tobacco industry’s advertising, manufacturing, marketing, sales, and scientific research activities for the last century. Researchers, journalists, students, and activists interested in tobacco control issues and public health policies use the Library extensively to investigate tobacco industry strategies.\n\nIn 1994, the Attorneys General of four states—Mississippi, Minnesota, Florida, and Texas—separately filed lawsuits against the tobacco industry in an effort to secure reimbursement for health care expenditures arising from tobacco-related illnesses. During the course of this litigation, 42 other states joined in similar legal actions. The library of the University of California San Francisco (USCF) had started digitizing and hosting internal tobacco industry documents in 1995 - these efforts were part of wider efforts to make public what the tobacco industry had done and helped drive the turning of public sentiment and litigation against the tobacco companies.\n\nIn 1998, a Master Settlement Agreement (MSA) was signed by the Attorneys General of 46 states and the nation's five major tobacco companies: Philip Morris, R. J. Reynolds, Lorillard, Brown & Williamson, and the American Tobacco Company. The MSA effectively settled the outstanding lawsuits by requiring yearly payments by the tobacco companies to the states and placing restrictions on the advertising and marketing of tobacco products.\n\nAs part of the Master Settlement Agreement, the U.S. tobacco companies were ordered to release the internal documents produced for the case for public access in both a physical depository in Minnesota and on their own document websites. The international tobacco company, British American Tobacco, was not ordered to provide a document website but they were required to deposit documents into a depository in Guildford, England. The National Association of Attorneys General (NAAG) provides oversight and enforcement of this operation. In 2006, U.S. District Judge Gladys Kessler ruled in a separate case that the nation's top tobacco companies violated racketeering laws, misleading the public for years about the health hazards of smoking. These companies were convicted under the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act (RICO Act). Philip Morris and R.J. Reynolds filed an appeal but Judge Kessler's ruling was upheld. As a result of this case and its appeals, the companies are now obliged to make available any documents produced for litigation on smoking and health until 2021.\n\nThe MSA provisions also created and funded the American Legacy Foundation, subsequently renamed to the Truth Initiative, an anti-smoking advocacy group, and in the early 2000s the foundation gave around $10 million of the settlement funds it managed to UCSF to formalize the collection it already hosted into the Legacy Tobacco Documents Library and to expand their efforts. In 2002, NAAG gave the UCSF Library a large number of document index records and images to further develop the LTDL. Documents are continually added to the MSA collections through the use of spidering (also known as \"web crawling\") applications that identify and download index records and document images directly from the tobacco companies’ websites.\n\nThe Library collects and maintains the internal documents of the tobacco companies and their trade organizations that were a party to the Master Settlement Agreement as well as documents from other litigation or companies not party to the settlement. Among the documents are more than 8,000 tobacco industry video and audio tapes including recordings of focus groups, internal corporate meetings, depositions of tobacco industry employees, government hearings, corporate communications, and commercials. Many of the acquired tapes are available for viewing or listening on the Internet Archive at the UCSF Tobacco Industry Videos Collection.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "24469407", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=24469407", "title": "Young invincibles", "text": "Young invincibles\n\nMembers of the United States population between the ages of 18 and 29 who decide that it is in their financial best interest to forgo health insurance are sometimes referred to as young invincibles by the insurance industry, a term coined to express the idea that the young demographic perceives themselves as immune to sickness and injury. The argument is that these individuals are young and in good health, so they have a low risk of experiencing substantial health issues that would lead to large amounts of spending on health care. Further, this group tends to have a mentality of “it won’t happen to me” with regards to most causes of injury. Together, these beliefs lead to the young invincibles not purchasing insurance.\n\nThere are risks associated with the young invincibles choosing to operate outside of the health insurance market, stemming from the economic phenomenon of adverse selection. Adverse selection is a principle describing the situation where people purchase insurance based on their expected use. People who anticipate using the most medical services purchase the most generous insurance plans, while people who do not expect to use many medical services are inclined not to purchase insurance at all.\nDue to the risk-spreading design of insurance, the adverse selection associated with the young invincibles leads to higher premiums for people who choose to purchase health insurance. As insurance premiums rise, more healthy people decide that it is not worth the higher prices, and drop out of the market, leading to what is called the \"adverse selection death spiral.\" By contrast, if young adults purchase insurance but continue to utilize very little health care services, the money they pay in premiums can go towards support the expenditures of people utilizing many health care services.\n\nThis problem of ballooning health insurance premiums has persisted for years, and was important in the debate over the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, commonly called the Affordable Care Act (ACA). One set of ACA provisions eliminated the insurance industry’s ability to charge different premiums to people with differing health status and the ability to exclude individuals with pre-existing conditions. Implemented alone, these provisions would greatly increase the risk in the health insurance market, and premiums would increase to cover associated increases in expenditure. Therefore, the ACA includes a number of provisions aimed at incentivizing young invincibles to enter into the health insurance market.\n\nIndividual mandate. The individual mandate applies to young adults and young adults may be eligible for a premium tax credit, lowering or eliminating the cost of insurance. This is particularly significant for young adults because they disproportionately compose those with incomes between 133-400% of the Federal Poverty Line who are entering the workforce for the first time. It is estimated that approximately nine million young adults ages 18–34 could be eligible for a subsidy.\n\nDependent coverage. Legislation requires family insurance plans with dependent coverage to extend this coverage until young adults reach the age of 26. Prior to the ACA, most employer-based health insurance plans stopped dependent coverage when the child turned 18 or 19, or had graduated from college. Effective September 23, 2010, young adults can join or remain on their parents’ insurance plans even if they are married, not living with their parents, attending school, financially independent from their parents, or eligible to enroll in an employer’s insurance plan. The coverage extension applies to both employer-based and private plans.\nCatastrophic coverage. Adults who are under the age of 30 and have experienced certain hardship may qualify for a cheaper “catastrophic” health plan. The catastrophic health plan is meant to protect young adults from very high medical costs. Purchased through the Exchanges, the plan covers three primary care visits per year at no cost to the individual and covers free preventive services. Reasons for exemption vary, such as homelessness or experience of domestic violence, and some require documented proof, such as an eviction or foreclosure notice. However, regardless of income, young adults must pay the standard price for the catastrophic plan (i.e., individuals purchasing these plans are not eligible for lower monthly premiums or lower out-of-pocket costs based on income).\n\nOther provisions. Many other ACA provisions are also relevant to young adults and effectively encourage young adults to buy insurance:\n· The expansion of Medicaid, if universally adopted, could cover nearly 7.8 million young adults under the age of 35. As of December 11, 2013, 25 states and the District of Columbia planned to expand their Medicaid programs beginning in 2014. \n· As with other individuals, young adults cannot be denied health coverage due to a pre-existing condition.\n\nThe White House faces the challenge of proving the value of health insurance to at least 2.7 million young invincibles who have historically been under-represented in the insurance pool.\n\nMany studies reporting on this effort conclude that insurance may be too great an expense and provide too little benefit to healthy young adults, making them willing to pay the penalty instead. Analysis suggests that healthy young adults who opt out of insurance could spend an average of five times less on health care than those who sign up for insurance. Another barrier to enrolling young adults is political or ideological opposition to the ACA. As health care reform under the ACA is closely associated with the Obama Administration and the Democratic Party, some young Americans may base their support on political affiliation. Political groups opposed to reform have developed campaigns encouraging young adults to refrain from purchasing insurance in the Marketplaces. One example is Generation Opportunity’s digital and grassroots “Opt-Out” initiative.\n\nEfforts to enroll young adults were impeded as this subset of the population and people across the United States had great difficulty in accessing and using Healthcare.gov (the site intended to help people enroll in the Federally facilitated Exchange) during the initial enrollment launch in 2013.\n\nCampaigns. Leading up to and throughout the first annual enrollment period, health insurance Marketplaces and advocacy groups released social media and other forms of campaigns. Many of these campaigns were aimed at encouraging young adults in particular to sign up for insurance. Examples include Covered California’s “Tell a Friend - Get Covered” and “Got Insurance,” a project of the Colorado Consumer Health Initiative and ProgressNow Colorado. Maryland’s Maryland Health Connection partnered with 2013 Super Bowl champions, the Baltimore Ravens, to connect with residents on the importance of developing a “health coverage game plan.” The American Association of Retired Persons (AARP) developed a series of e-cards for parents to send to their children as a reminder to sign up before the enrollment deadline.\n\nCelebrity endorsements. Celebrities including pop icon Lady Gaga, singers Adam Levine and John Legend, and actresses Olivia Wilde and Amy Poehler, have shown public support for the ACA and Marketplace enrollment via Twitter and other social media outlets.\n\nNational Youth Enrollment Day. A National Youth Enrollment Day launched on February 15, 2014. The initiative was led by the non-profits Young Invincibles and Get Covered America.\n\nInitial enrollment data from the Department of Health and Human Services show that young adults are signing up for plans in the Federally facilitated Exchange. Numbers from the first quarter of Marketplace activity (October 1, 2013 to December 28, 2013) demonstrated that nearly one-quarter (24%) of the population who had selected a Marketplace plan were between the ages of 18 and 34, reflective of the proportion of young adults making up the same age group in the general population. An eight-fold increase was observed in the cumulative number of 18- to 34-year-olds who signed up for a marketplace plan in the last month of the reported period. At the same time, the Commonwealth Fund’s Affordable Care Act Tracking Study revealed that 41% of visitors to Marketplaces were between the ages of 19 and 34, suggesting that overall enrollment numbers would continue to increase as the March 31, 2014 deadline approached.\n\nAt the state level, initial Marketplace enrollment data for young adults generally reflected that of the Federally facilitated Exchange. Most states reported 21-27% participation by this key age group. States at lower extremes included Arkansas, Arizona and New Mexico, with initial enrollment rates by young adults hovering between 17-18%. Massachusetts and the District of Columbia are among those reporting higher initial rates of enrollment by young adults, at 31% and 43%, respectively.\n"}
