There were 57 total confirmed cases, resulting in 22 deaths.\n\nListeriosis is an infection caused by the bacterium \"Listeria monocytogenes\". The outbreak originated from lines 8 and 9 of the Maple Leaf Foods Bartor Road facility (Establishment No. 97B) in North York, Ontario, a neighbourhood of Toronto. There were about 220 possibly contaminated products, each stamped with the code \"97B\" near the \"Best before\" date. Since the bacteria travelled through deli meats, which are cooked (and as a result are usually free of pathogens), the contamination likely occurred during packaging. The outbreak was first noticed in July when regular surveillance detected an increase in cases reported. Federal inspectors usually spent less than 5 hours a day at the plant in the months before the outbreak of the illness, sometimes as little as 70 minutes.\n\nMaple Leaf Foods had instituted a voluntary recall before the outbreak was linked to their plant; upon confirming the link, they expanded the recall to all products from the Bartor Road facility. In a press conference, President and CEO of Maple Leaf Foods Michael McCain stated, \"Tragically, our products have been linked to illness and loss of life. To those people who are ill, and to the families who have lost loved ones, I offer my deepest and sincerest sympathies. Words cannot begin to express our sadness for their pain.\"\n\nOfficials from Maple Leaf believe that the outbreak originated sometime in July on line 8 or line 9 of the North York facility. Regardless, the entire plant has undergone intense sanitation, which began August 21. About 80 workers were involved in the cleanup, with additional outside experts and microbiologists supervising the operation. They used peroxyacetic acid, quaternary ammonium compound, isopropyl alcohol, refrigeration gel and a granular compound to disinfect the parts of the apparatuses. About 600 employees were to attend a four-hour training session on \"Listeria\" and on cleanliness, and about 250 employees were laid off while the plant was being cleaned.\n\nThe recall reportedly cost the company $20 million, about ten times the original estimate.\n\nOntario Premier Dalton McGuinty credited the discovery of the outbreak to an early-warning system implemented after the 2003 SARS outbreak in Toronto. Canadian Health Minister Tony Clement stated that he expected the number of cases to rise with time, since the bacteria have a lengthy incubation period. Minister of Agriculture Gerry Ritz stated at a news conference: \"Let me state on behalf of the government that our thoughts and prayers are with the family and friends of those that are affected [...] And of course, I'd like to reiterate that our highest priority continues to be making sure that Canadian families' food supply is safe.\"\n\nOn the federal political level, there was a debate on the privatization of food inspection. A cabinet document leaked earlier in the year outlined a plan to save money at the Canadian Food Inspection Agency (CFIA) by shifting federal meat inspectors into an oversight role and leaving companies to implement their own methods. Liberal leader St√©phane Dion was harshly critical and drew comparisons to the 2000 Walkerton tainted water tragedy and the privatization of propane inspection, which he blamed for the 2008 Toronto explosions. Gerry Ritz responded that the CFIA had added 200 inspectors since the Conservatives came to power, adding, \"As opposed to having our inspectors standing line by line, they'll have a more oversight role within the plant itself [...] We're trying to build a better mousetrap here.\" New Democratic Party agriculture critic Alex Atamanenko said he strongly opposed the apparent privatization plans. The NDP claimed that policy changes first put in place by the Liberals and then continued under the Conservative government were to blame for the outbreak.\n\nOn September 17, 2008, Agricultural Minister Gerry Ritz made national news when comments he made on an August 30, 2008 conference call with government officials were made public. Ritz was quoted as saying, \"This is like a death by a thousand cuts. Or should I say cold cuts.\" Then, when told of a death in Prince Edward Island, Ritz said, \"Please tell me it's (Liberal MP) Wayne Easter.\" Ritz apologized for his remarks, but various groups called for his resignation. New Democratic Party Leader Jack Layton responded by saying, \"Canadians are dying because of the mismanagement of our government... there should absolutely never be that kind of humour... It illustrates the government is not taking this matter as seriously as they should.\" A spokesman for Prime Minister Harper released a statement saying Ritz's comments were tasteless and completely inappropriate. Stephen Harper refused to seek Ritz's resignation.\n\nFour separate class-action lawsuits were filed in Ontario, Quebec, Saskatchewan, and British Columbia. The lawsuit in Ontario claimed damages of $350 million. All lawsuits were filed by \"Merchant Law Group\".\n\nThe lawsuits were settled in December 2008 for $27 million.\n\nAll the cheques to claimants were mailed on the afternoon of February 3, 2012.\n\nA court order for a \"Pro Rata Reduction to all entitlements\" was ordered, meaning that\nall claims were delivered at 93.04% of the original agreement. Claimants had until August 1, 2012\nto cash their cheques.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "5376601", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=5376601", "title": "AFL Tribunal", "text": "AFL Tribunal\n\nThe AFL Tribunal is the disciplinary tribunal of the Australian Football League (AFL), an Australian rules football competition. The Tribunal regulates the conduct of players, umpires, and other officials associated with the AFL and its clubs.\n\nPrior to 2005, any player who was reported would face a hearing at the AFL Tribunal. This process had become problematic, and in 2005, a new system (similar to that used by the NRL Judiciary at the time) was adopted. The changes were primarily made to reduce the number of tribunal hearings, and to improve the consistency of penalties.\n\nThe current tribunal process is as follows:\n\nOn-field umpires and certain off-field observers can report players for incidents which occur during games. On the Monday after the round of football, each incident is then reviewed by the Match Review Panel, a small panel of former players and umpires. Within the review, the Match Review Panel grades the severity of the incident in three factors, and awards \"activation points\" depending upon the severity. The three factors are:\nThe activation points from all three categories are added together to give the \"total activation points\" for the incident. It is important to note that an incident involving accidental/incidental conduct, or negligible impact, will be rejected and the player will receive no penalty, even if the activation points in the other categories are high. Because of this, any offence must rate at least three activation points to be considered further.\n\nNext, activation points are converted into an offence \"level\":\n\nNext, the player is given a number of \"base demerit points\", based on the type and level of his offence. The base demerit point totals are standardised in the \"Table of Offences\". As an example, any player charged by the Match Review Panel with a Level 4 Kicking offence receives 550 base demerit points. This is where the Match Review Panel's role in the Tribunal process ends.\n\nFollowing the Match Review Panel's findings, a player's base points are subjected to a series of \"additions\" and \"deductions\" (which are described in the next section) to arrive at a number of \"total demerit points\". Each 100 total demerit points that a player finishes with then corresponds to a suspension for one match; \"e.g.\" a player who finished with 225 demerit points will receive a two-match suspension. If a player finishes with fewer than 100 demerit points, he is not suspended, but receives what is known as a \"reprimand\".\n\nBecause the penalty is standardised and pre-announced by the Match Review Panel, the player has the option to plead guilty to the charge and receive his penalty without the need to attend a Tribunal hearing; he receives a \"deduction\" for doing this (see next section). Alternatively, a player may choose to appeal the findings of the Match Review Panel, and attend a Tribunal hearing to argue the case. Players may appeal to try to have their entire charge withdrawn, or may argue for a reduction in one of the three factors; \"e.g.\" a player could try to have the conduct factor reduced from reckless to negligent. Should a player successfully reduce the severity of his infraction, the penalty is re-evaluated and the player is again given the choice to plead guilty or further contest the revised charge.\n\nIf an incident is ungraded (\"i.e.\" has nine activation points), the player is required to attend a tribunal hearing.\n\n\"Residuals\" (also called carry-over points) are any points a player may still have below the 100 required for a suspension. For every 100 points accrued, the player is suspended one week and the 100 points are subtracted; \"e.g.\", a player with 225 demerit points is suspended for two weeks; 200 points are correspondingly subtracted, and the remaining 25 are residual points; or, if a player receives a reprimand with 93.75 points, all of these points are residual as they are not enough to draw a suspension. Residual points from a previous offence will be added to the base demerit points of the player's next offence if it occurs within one year; a player's residual points are cancelled if a year elapses without a punishable offence.\n\nA player with prior suspensions over the past two years is subject to an additional penalty known as \"loading\". For each week in excess of two that a player has been suspended over the past two years, he receives an additional penalty of 10% of the current offence's original base score, up to a maximum penalty of 50%; \"e.g.\" a player suspended for three matches will receive a 10% loading, while one suspended for seven matches will receive a 50% loading. (Prior to 2013, the relevant period was three years, and loading began with the first match suspended.)\n\nAny player with more than six years (increased in 2013, previously five years) experience who has not been found guilty of a punishable offence over the previous five years receives a 25% deduction.\n\nAny reportable offence that occurs during a Grand Final match will receive an addition called the \"double penalty\": equal to the offence's original base score as determined by the Match Review Panel. This addition is applied after the additions and deductions previously mentioned. This loading is meant to discourage excessively rough play encouraged because any penalties given as a result would not apply until the following season. A rough fight in the 2004 AFL Grand Final between Alastair Lynch and Darryl Wakelin resulted in the Tribunal handing down stiff penalties and adding the double penalty rule.\n\nFinally, players will receive a 25% deduction by accepting the Match Review Panel's finding without contest; this is typically known as an \"early guilty plea\". As a result of this rule, players are often faced with the option of accepting a shorter suspension with an early plea, or contesting the charge and risking a longer suspension if unsuccessful. Note that if a player contests the match review panel's assessment at the Tribunal, and successfully has the number of base demerit points changed, the penalty is re-evaluated, meaning the player, in spite of attending a hearing, can still take an early guilty plea on the revised charge.\n\nThe final offence score is thus calculated from this series of discrete steps:\nEach addition or deduction is made to the final result of the previous calculation step.\n\nThe Match Review Panel also assesses a variety of offences for which players are fined but not suspended, including wrestling, negligent contact with an umpire, making an obscene gesture, etc. As for physical offences, there is a standardised table of penalties, which depend upon the nature of the offence, and any prior similar offences; \"e.g.\" a player's second wrestling offence attracts double the penalty of his first. As for physical offences, a player can accept his penalty with an early guilty plea, receiving a 25% reduction in his fine, or he may contest it and risk the full penalty.\n\nIf a player wishes to appeal against a decision handed down in a tribunal hearing, he may take his case to the AFL Appeals Board. The board will re-hear the case, with a different set of panel members, and may uphold or change the Tribunal's original decision. The Appeals Board was established in 1998 following a recommendation from Justice John Hedigan of the Supreme Court of Victoria, after several tribunal findings were appealed through the Victorian court system during the mid-1990s.\n\nAs of May 2011, under the official AFL Deregistration Policy, any player who accumulates a total of at least 10 weeks of suspensions over the course of his football career (both inside and outside the AFL) receives a formal notice that further suspensions can result in his automatic deregistration from the league. Any player who accumulates a total of at least 16 weeks of suspensions over the course of his career will be automatically deregistered from the AFL and barred from any further participation. Any previous suspensions within the AFL are carried over at only half their original length (e.g. a previous suspension of four weeks will only count as two weeks under this policy), but any immediate suspension is to be considered at its full length. If a player receives an immediate first suspension of at least 16 weeks, deregistration is left to the discretion of the League.\n\nA deregistered player may apply for an exemption to re-register or appeal the deregistration under the appropriate laws of the league. However, only one request can be made. Should a player be exempted and re-registered, any further suspension will result in permanent, irrevocable deregistation.\n\nDeregistration is only practiced in country or suburban football competitions; it is not practiced by the AFL. According to an AFL spokesperson, the deregistration policy was designed for serial aggressive offenders, not low-level repeat offenders, and that the AFL did not believe there has been a repeat offender issue at AFL level over the last 20 years where a player has been getting repeated, long suspensions for repeated behind-play offences.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSince the overhaul, the heaviest suspension for a single offence has been eight weeks, handed out to Fremantle's Dean Solomon for elbowing Geelong's Cameron Ling in round 15 of the 2008 season, and to 's Andrew Gaff for striking 's Andrew Brayshaw in round 20 of the 2018 season.\n\nIn Round 4, 2008 Barry Hall of the Sydney Swans was suspended for seven matches after striking West Coast's Brent Staker. \n\nIn 2007, Steven Baker of St Kilda was suspended for seven matches for rough conduct on Jeff Farmer (although the base suspension was only four weeks, with residual points and a significant loading due to his poor record his penalty increased to seven).\n\nThe longest suspension was handed out in June 2010, St Kilda's Steven Baker was suspended for a total of nine weeks after he pleaded guilty to three striking charges and was found guilty of a misconduct charge, all against Geelong's Steve Johnson. He was the first person to be charged with misconduct for interfering with an injured opponent.\n\nIn May 2014, midfielder Jack Viney was sent straight to the tribunal following a bump which resulted in forward Tom Lynch breaking his jaw. Viney was found guilty of rough conduct by the tribunal, and suspended for two matches, after it was ruled that he had alternate options rather than elect to bump Lynch. Melbourne subsequently appealed the suspension, which was successfully overturned, making it just the second time since 2005 that an appeal against the AFL Tribunal's ruling was overruled.\n\nIn June 2017, the AFL challenged the tribunal's verdict for the first time in history, following an off-the-ball incident involving player Bachar Houli and 's Jed Lamb: Houli was originally given a two-week suspension for striking Lamb during the first quarter of the Round 14 match at the Melbourne Cricket Ground. Houli was reported for the incident, which saw Lamb sit out the remainder of the match, and sent straight to the tribunal the following day. When his case went before the tribunal that week, he was given the two-week suspension, but part of the reason the penalty was low was due to character reference statements given by Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull and media personality Waleed Aly. Following an announcement of the penalty, there was a public outcry about the length of the suspension. The following day the AFL announced they would challenge the decision, and the matter would be heard in front of the appeals tribunal. Following an extensive review hearing, Houli's suspension was doubled from two weeks to four weeks.\n\nIn June 2018, player Jeremy Cameron became the first player in AFL history to be referred directly to the tribunal more than once in his career, where he was found guilty of striking Brisbane Lions player Harris Andrews and suspended for five matches. He had previously been sent straight to the tribunal after breaking Rhys Mathieson's jaw during a pre-season match in 2016, for which he was suspended for four matches.\n\nLongest suspension \nQualification - 20 matches\n\nOne noteworthy suspension administered by the VFL Tribunal was that of John Bourke of the Collingwood Reserves team. In an outburst broadcast on Australian television on 4 May 1985, he kicked Sydney Swans ruckman Patrick Foy in the groin in response to Foy tagging him throughout the game. When umpire Phil Waight attempted to send Burke off for the incident, a visibly upset Burke shoved him to the ground and kicked him, struck the Collingwood runner, and then jumped into the stands to attack a Swans fan. The Tribunal suspended him for 10 years plus 16 games (later commuted to seven years). This suspension is not listed above because he was not a member of a Senior team, but it remains one of the most infamous suspensions in the modern history of the sport, being covered by Australian news for some time afterward.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "411021", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=411021", "title": "Chlamydia trachomatis", "text": "Chlamydia trachomatis\n\nChlamydia trachomatis (), commonly known as chlamydia, is a bacterium that can only replicate in human cells. It causes chlamydia, which can manifest in various ways, including: trachoma, lymphogranuloma venereum, nongonococcal urethritis, cervicitis, salpingitis, pelvic inflammatory disease. \"C. trachomatis\" is the most common infectious cause of blindness and the most common sexually transmitted bacterium.\n\nDifferent types of \"C. trachomatis\" cause different diseases. The most common strains cause disease in the genital tract, while other strains cause disease in the eye or lymph nodes. Like other \"Chlamydia\" species, the \"C. trachomatis\" life cycle consists of two morphologically distinct life stages: elementary bodies and reticulate bodies. Elementary bodies are spore-like and infectious. Reticulate bodies are the replicative stage and are only seen within host cells.\n\n\"Chlamydia trachomatis\" is a gram-negative bacteria that can only replicate within a host cell. Over the course of the \"C. trachomatis\" life cycle, the bacteria take on two distinct forms. Elementary bodies are 200 to 400 nanometers across, and are surrounded by a rigid cell wall that allows them to survive outside of a host cell. This form can initiate a new infection if it comes into contact with a susceptible host cell. Reticulate bodies are 600 to 1500 nanometers across, and are only found within host cells. Neither form is motile.\n\nThe \"C. trachomatis\" genome is substantially smaller than that of many other bacteria at approximately 1.04 megabases, encoding approximately 900 genes. A number of important metabolic functions are not encoded in the \"C. trachomatis\" genome, and instead are likely scavenged from the host cell. In addition to the chromosome that contains most of the genome, nearly all \"C. trachomatis\" strains carry a 7.5 kilobase plasmid that contains 8 genes. The role of this plasmid is unknown, though strains without the plasmid have been isolated, suggesting it is not required for suvival of the bacterium.\n\nLike other \"Chlamydia\" species, \"C. trachomatis\" has a life cycle consisting of two morphologically distinct forms. First, \"C. trachomatis\" attaches to a new host cell as a small spore-like form called the elementary body. The elementary body enters the host cell, surrounded by a host vacuole, called an inclusion. Within the inclusion, \"C. trachomatis\" transforms into a larger, more metabolically active form called the reticulate body. The reticulate body substantially modifies the inclusion, making it a more hospitable environment for rapid replication of the bacteria, which occurs over the following 30 to 72 hours. The massive number of intracellular bacteria then transition back to resistant elementary bodies, before causing the cell to rupture and being released into the environment. These new elementary bodies are then shed in the semen or released from epithelial cells of the female genital tract, and attach to new host cells.\n\n\"C. trachomatis\" are bacteria in the phylum Chlamydiae, a group of obligate intracellular parasites of eukaryotic cells.\n\n\"C. trachomatis\" strains are generally divided into three biovars based on the type of disease they cause. These are further subdivided into several serovars based on surface antigens recognized by the immune system. Serovars A through C cause trachoma. Serovars D through K infect the genital tract, causing pelvic inflammatory disease, ectopic pregnancies, and infertility. Serovars L1 through L3 cause an invasive infection of the lymph nodes near the genitals, called lymphogranuloma venereum.\n\n\"C. trachomatis\" is thought to have diverged from other \"Chlamydia\" species around 6 million years ago, when its sole host modern humans emerged. The closest relative to \"C. trachomatis\" is \"C. muridarum\", which infects mice. Different evolutionarily distinct lineages of \"C. trachomatis\" seem to cause disease in different body niches:\n\nClinical signs and symptoms of \"C. trachomatis\" infection and gonorrhea infection are indistinguishable.\nBoth are common causes of urethritis. \"C. trachomatis\" is the single most important infectious agent associated with blindness (trachoma); about 84 million worldwide suffer \"C. trachomatis\" eye infections and 8 million are blinded as a result of the infection.\n\nElementary bodies are generally present in the semen of infected men and vaginal secretions of infected women. When they come into contact with a new host cell, the elementary bodies bind to the cell via interaction between adhesins on their surface and several host receptor proteins and heparan sulfate proteoglycans. Once attached, the bacteria inject various effector proteins into the host cell using a type three secretion system. These effectors trigger the host cell to take up the elementary bodies and prevent the cell from triggering apoptosis. Within 6 to 8 hours after infection, the elementary bodies transition to reticulate bodies and a number of new effectors are synthesized. These effectors include a number of proteins that modify the inclusion membrane, called Inc proteins, as well as proteins that redirect host vesicles to the inclusion. 8 to 16 hours after infection, another set of effectors are synthesized, driving acquisition of nutrients from the host cell. At this stage, the reticulate bodies begin to divide, causing the inclusion to expand. If several elemenary bodies have infected a single cell, their inclusions will fuse at this point to create a single large inclusion in the host cell. From 24 to 72 hours after infection, reticulate bodies transition to elementary bodies which are released either by lysis of the host cell or extrusion of the entire inclusion into the host genital tract.\n\nMost people infected with \"C. trachomatis\" are asymptomatic. However, the bacteria can present in one of three ways: genitourinary (genitals), pulmonary (lungs), and ocular (eyes). Genitourinary cases can include genital discharge, vaginal bleeding, itchiness (pruritus), painful urination (dysuria), among other symptoms. Often, symptoms are similar to those of a urinary tract infection.\n\nThree times as many women as men are diagnosed with genitourinary \"C. trachomatis\" infections. Women aged 15‚Äì19 have the highest prevalence, followed by women aged 20‚Äì24, although the rate of increase of diagnosis is greater for men than for women. Risk factors for genitourinary infections include unprotected sex with multiple partners, lack of condom use, and living in an urban area.\n\nPulmonary infections can occur in infants born to women with active chlamydia infections, although the rate of infection is less than 10%.\n\nOcular infections take the form of conjunctivitis or trachoma, both in adults and children. Trachoma is the primary source of infectious blindness in some parts of rural Africa and Asia and is a neglected tropical disease that has been targeted by the World Health Organization for elimination by 2020.\n\nTreatment depends on the infection site, age of the patient, and whether another infection is present. Having a \"C. trachomatis\" and one or more other sexually transmitted infections at the same time is possible. Treatment is often done with both partners simultaneously to prevent reinfection. \"C. trachomatis\" may be treated with several antibiotic medications, including azithromycin, erythromycin, or ofloxacin.\n\nAzithromycin and doxycycline have equal efficacy to treat C. trachomatis with 97 and 98 percent success respectively. Treatment with doxycycline generic 2x1 100¬†mg for 7 days has equal success with expensive delayed-released doxycycline 1x 200¬†mg for 7 days.\n\nIf treatment is necessary during pregnancy, levofloxacin, ofloxacin, and doxycycline are not prescribed. In the case of a patient who is pregnant, the medications typically prescribed are azithromycin, amoxicillin, and erythromycin. Amoxicillin has fewer side effects than the other medications for treating antenatal \"C. trachomatis\" infection. Retesting during pregnancy can be performed three weeks after treatment. If the risk of reinfection is high, screening can be repeated throughout pregnancy.\n\nIf the infection has progressed, ascending the reproductive tract and pelvic inflammatory disease develops, damage to the fallopian tubes may have already occurred. In most cases, the \"C. trachomatis\" infection is then treated on an outpatient basis with azithromycin or doxycycline. Treating the mother of an infant with \"C. trachomatis\" of the eye, which can evolve into a pneumonia, is recommended.\n\n\"Chlamydia\" species are readily identified and distinguished from other \"Chlamydia\" species using DNA-based tests.\n\nMost strains of \"C. trachomatis\" are recognized by monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) to epitopes in the VS4 region of MOMP. However, these mAbs may also cross-react with two other \"Chlamydia\" species, \"C. suis\" and \"C. muridarum\".\n\n\nDue to its significance to human health, \"C. trachomatis\" is the subject of research in laboratories around the world. The bacteria are commonly grown in immortalised cell lines such as McCoy cells and HeLa cells. Infectious particles can be quantified by infecting cell layers and counting the number of inclusions, analagous to a plaque assay.\n\n\"C. trachomatis\" was first described in 1907 by Stanislaus von Prowazek and Ludwig Halberst√§dter in scrapings from trachoma cases. Thinking they had discovered a \"mantled protozoan\", they named the organism \"Chlamydozoa\" from the Greek \"Chlamys\" meaning mantle. Over the next several decades, \"Chlamydozoa\" was thought to be a virus as it was small enough to pass through bacterial filters and unable to grow on known laboratory media. However, in 1966 electron microscopy studies showed \"C. trachomatis\" to be a bacterium.\n\n\"C. trachomatis\" agent was first cultured and isolated in the yolk sacs of eggs by Tang Fei-fan, \"et al.\" in 1957.<ref>\n"}

The symptoms of \"chronic Lyme\" are generic and non-specific \"symptoms of life\".\n\nA number of alternative health products are promoted for \"chronic Lyme disease\", of which possibly the most controversial and harmful is long-term antibiotic therapy, particularly intravenous antibiotics. Recognised authorities advise against long-term antibiotic treatment for Lyme disease, even where some symptoms persist post-treatment. Following disciplinary proceedings by State medical licensing boards in the United States, a subculture of \"Lyme literate\" physicians has successfully lobbied for specific legal protections, exempting them from the standard of care and Infectious Diseases Society of America treatment guidelines. This \"troubling\" political interference in medical care has been criticised as an example of \"legislative alchemy\", the process whereby pseudomedicine is legislated into practice.\n\nThe term \"chronic Lyme disease\" is distinct from untreated late-stage Lyme disease, which can cause arthritis, peripheral neuropathy and/or encephalomyelitis. Chronic Lyme disease is also distinct from the 'post-treatment Lyme disease syndrome' (PTLDS)\", when symptoms linger after standard antibiotic treatments. PTLDS is estimated to occur in less than 5% of people who had Lyme disease and were treated. In many cases there is no objective evidence that people who believe they have chronic Lyme have ever been infected with Lyme disease: standard diagnostic tests for infection are often negative.\nWhile it is undisputed people can have severe symptoms of an illness, the cause and appropriate treatment promoted by \"chronic Lyme\" advocates are controversial. The symptoms represent \"for all intents and purposes\" fibromyalgia or chronic fatigue syndrome. A few doctors attribute these symptoms to persistent infection with \"Borrelia\", or co-infections with other tick-borne pathogens, such as \"Ehrlichia\" and \"Babesia\". Some conclude that the initial infection may cause an autoimmune reaction that continues to cause serious symptoms even after the bacteria have been eliminated by antibiotics. A review looked at several animal studies that found persistence of live but disabled spirochetes following treatment of \"B. burgdorferi\" infection with antibiotics. The authors noted that none of the lingering spirochetes were associated with inflamed tissues and criticized the studies for not considering adequately the different pharmacodynamics and pharmacokinetics of the antibiotics used to treat the animals in the trials versus what would be expected to be used to treat humans. The authors concluded, \"There is no scientific evidence to support the hypothesis that such spirochetes, should they exist in humans, are the cause of post-Lyme disease syndrome.\"\nMajor US medical authorities, including the Infectious Diseases Society of America, the American Academy of Neurology, and the National Institutes of Health, have stated there is no convincing evidence that \"Borrelia\" is involved in the various symptoms classed as chronic Lyme disease, and particularly advise against long-term antibiotic treatment as it is ineffective and potentially harmful. Prolonged antibiotic therapy presents significant risks and can have dangerous side effects. Randomized placebo-controlled studies have shown that antibiotics offer no sustained benefit in people with \"chronic Lyme\", with evidence of both placebo effects and significant adverse effects from such treatment. A pressure group called the International Lyme and Associated Diseases Society (ILADS) argues the persistence of \"B. burgdorferi\" may be responsible for manifestations of late Lyme disease symptoms.\n\nWhile there is general agreement on the optimal treatment for early Lyme disease, the existence of chronic Lyme is generally rejected and there is no consensus even among advocates over its prevalence, diagnostic criteria, or treatment. The evidence-based perspective is exemplified by a 2007 review in \"The New England Journal of Medicine,\" which noted the diagnosis of chronic Lyme disease is used by a few physicians despite a lack of \"reproducible or convincing scientific evidence\", leading the authors to describe this diagnosis as \"the latest in a series of syndromes that have been postulated in an attempt to attribute medically unexplained symptoms to particular infections.\" Medical authorities agree with this viewpoint: the Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA), the American Academy of Neurology, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), and the National Institutes of Health (NIH), advise against long-term antibiotic treatment for chronic Lyme disease, given the lack of supporting evidence and the potential toxicities.\n\nA minority, primarily not medical practitioners, holds that chronic Lyme disease is responsible for a range of unexplained symptoms, sometimes in people without any evidence of past infection. This viewpoint is promoted by many who have been told they have the condition. Groups advocates and the small number of physicians who support the concept of chronic Lyme disease have organized to lobby for recognition of this diagnosis, as well as to argue for insurance coverage of long-term antibiotic therapy, which most insurers deny, as it is at odds with the guidelines of major medical organizations.\n\nIn 2006, Richard Blumenthal, the Connecticut Attorney General, opened an antitrust investigation against the IDSA, accusing the IDSA Lyme disease panel of undisclosed conflicts of interest and of unduly dismissing alternative therapies and chronic Lyme disease. The investigation was closed on May 1, 2008, without charges when the IDSA agreed to submit to a review of its guidelines by a panel of independent scientists and physicians which would occur on July 30, 2009, citing mounting legal costs and the difficulty of presenting scientific arguments in a legal setting. The medical validity of the IDSA guidelines was not challenged, and a journalist writing in \"Nature Medicine\" suggested some IDSA members may not have disclosed potential conflicts of interest, while a \"Forbes\" piece described Blumenthal's investigation as \"intimidation\" of scientists by an elected official with close ties to Lyme advocacy groups. The \"Journal of the American Medical Association\" described the decision as an example of the \"politicization of health policy\" that went against the weight of scientific evidence and may have a chilling effect on future decisions by medical associations. \n\nThe expert panel's review was published in 2010, with the independent doctors and scientists in the panel unanimously endorsing the guidelines, stating \"No changes or revisions to the 2006 Lyme guidelines are necessary at this time,\" and concluding long-term antibiotic treatments are unproven and potentially dangerous. The IDSA welcomed the final report, stating that \"Our number one concern is the patients we treat, and we're glad patients and their physicians now have additional reassurance that the guidelines are medically sound.\"\n\nThe state of Connecticut, meanwhile, enacted a law on June 18, 2009, \"to allow a licensed physician to prescribe, administer or dispense long-term antibiotics for a therapeutic purpose to a patient clinically diagnosed with Lyme disease.\" The states of Rhode Island, California, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, Vermont, New York, Maine and Iowa have similar laws.\n\nMassachusetts (2016) and Rhode Island (2003) have laws mandating insurance coverage for long-term antibiotic therapy for Lyme disease when deemed medically necessary by a physician. In 1999 Connecticut had passed a similar, though somewhat more restrictive law.\n\nPaul G. Auwaerter, director of infectious disease at Johns Hopkins School of Medicine, cited the political controversy and high emotions as contributing to a \"poisonous atmosphere\" around Lyme disease, which he believes has led to doctors trying to avoid having Lyme patients in their practices.\n\nIn 2001, \"The New York Times Magazine\" reported that Allen Steere, chief of immunology and rheumatology at Tufts Medical Center and a co-discoverer and leading expert on Lyme disease, had been harassed, stalked, and threatened by patients and patient advocacy groups angry at his refusal to substantiate their diagnoses of \"chronic\" Lyme disease and endorse long-term antibiotic therapy. Because this intimidation included death threats, Steere was assigned security guards.\n\nA 2004 study in \"The Pediatric Infectious Disease Journal\" stated nine of nineteen Internet websites surveyed contained what were described as major inaccuracies. Websites described as providing inaccurate information included several with the word \"lyme\" in their domain name (e.g., lymenet.org), as well as the website of the International Lyme and Associated Diseases Society. A 2007 article in \"The New England Journal of Medicine\" argued media coverage of chronic Lyme disease ignored scientific evidence in favor of anecdotes and testimonials:\n\nThe 2008 documentary-style film \"Under Our Skin: The Untold Story of Lyme Disease\" opened June 19, 2009, in New York City. This film, made by a director whose sister self-identified with the condition, is based on the premise that chronic Lyme disease exists. A columnist for \"Entertainment Weekly\" wrote of the film:\n\n"}

This condition was previously named chronic nonspecific multiple ulcers of the small intestine.\n\nThis disease occurs most commonly in women. Symptom onset is usually in adolescence. Symptoms include fatigue, oedema and abdominal pain. The disease course is chronic and while immunosuppressants have been tried these have not been shown to be helpful.\n\nOn small bowel endoscopy the ulcers may be visible.\n\nWithin the small intestine there are multiple small shallow ulcers which may be linear or concentric. Stensosis of the small bowel may be present due to healing of these ulcers. The ulcers resemble those associated with non steroidal use but occur in the absence of the use of these drugs.\n\nSequencing the DNA of several patients suggested a mutation in the SLCO2A1 gene. The presence of this mutation was confirmed by sequencing this gene in additional patients.\n\nThis gene encodes an prostaglandin transporter. As non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs inhibit prostaglandin synthesis this helps to explain the known similarity in the histological findings between these conditions. The identification of this mutation suggests that prostaglandin replacement may be helpful but this will need to be tested in a clinical trail.\n"}

Its basic premise is that \"the easiest way to win hearts and minds is through the stomach\". Official government-sponsored culinary diplomacy programs have been established in Thailand, South Korea, Malaysia, Peru, and the United States.\n\nThe terms \"culinary diplomacy\" and \"gastrodiplomacy\" have been in use since the early 2000s, and have been popularized by the work of public diplomacy scholars Paul Rockower and Sam Chapple-Sokol. An early mention of the concept was in a 2002 Economist article about the \"Thai Kitchen of the World\" program. In a 2011 article published in the Taiwanese journal \"Issues & Studies\", Rockower wrote that \"Gastrodiplomacy is predicated on the notion that the easiest way to win hearts and minds is through the stomach.\" Chapple-Sokol wrote in a 2013 article in the journal \"The Hague Journal of Diplomacy\" that culinary diplomacy is \"the use of food and cuisine as an instrument to create cross-cultural understanding in the hopes of improving interactions and cooperation.\"\n\nThe two terms \"culinary diplomacy\" and \"gastrodiplomacy\" are used interchangeably by many, though some scholars have differentiated the terms. Rockower, for example, claims that gastrodiplomacy refers to a tool of public diplomacy, while culinary diplomacy serves as \"a means to further diplomatic protocol through cuisine\". Chapple-Sokol writes that both of these fall under the broad categorization of \"culinary diplomacy\", and differentiates between \"public\" and \"private\" culinary diplomacy. The former refers to culinary diplomacy being used as a tool of public diplomacy, and more specifically cultural diplomacy, while the latter \"occurs behind closed doors\", akin to Rockower's definition.\n\nThe \"Global Thai\" program, launched in 2002, was a government-led culinary diplomacy initiative. It aimed to boost the number of Thai restaurants worldwide to 8,000 by 2003 from about 5,500 previously. By 2011, that number had swelled to more than 10,000 Thai restaurants worldwide.\n\nThe program was explained in \"Thailand: Kitchen of the World\", an eBook published to promote the program. The point of the e-book: \"In the view of the Export Promotion Department, Thai restaurants have a good business potential that can be developed to maintain a high level of international recognition. To achieve that goal, the department is carrying out a public relations campaign to build up a good image of the country through Thai restaurants worldwide.\"\n\nThe Department of Export Promotion of the Thai Ministry of Commerce offers potential restaurateurs plans for three different \"master restaurant\" types‚Äîfrom fast food to elegant‚Äîwhich investors can choose as a prefabricated restaurant plan. Concomitantly, the Export-Import Bank of Thailand offered loans to Thai nationals aiming to open restaurants abroad, and the Small and Medium Enterprise Development Bank of Thailand set up an infrastructure for loans of up to US$3 million for overseas food industry initiatives, including Thai restaurants.\n\nSouth Korea launched its own culinary diplomacy program in 2009, a $77m investment entitled \"Korean Cuisine to the World or \"Global \"Hansik\"\". The goals of the program, run by the Ministry of Food, Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries, are to promote the unique nature and health qualities of Korean cuisine (\"hansik\"), as well as to increase the number of Korean restaurants worldwide to 40,000 by 2017. Projects undertaken by the Korean government include the opening of a kimchi institute, working to establish Korean cuisine as a course in internationally recognized cooking schools, and the launch of a touring Korean food truck.\n\nSince 2010 Malaysia has undertaken a similar project by running the \"Malaysia Kitchen\" Programme. The programme, carried out by the Malaysia External Trade Development Corporation, has focused most of its efforts to promote Malaysian cuisine in Australia, United States and United Kingdom. Malaysia is an especially appropriate country to conduct culinary diplomacy due to its history as a culinary crossroads and its current mix of Malay, Chinese, and Indian populations. The approach, which has employed celebrity chefs such as Rick Stein and Norman Musa in the UK, has had significant impact in increasing awareness of Malaysian cuisine and Malaysian restaurants through product promotions and cooking demonstrations at supermarkets, food festivals and an annual night market at Trafalgar Square, London.\n\nAn official Peruvian culinary diplomacy program started in 2011, with Peru's application for its cuisine to be included in UNESCO's list of intangible cultural heritage, the first year food heritage was recognized. Peruvian cuisine was denied the status of food heritage in its initial application. The \"Cocina Peruana Para El Mundo\" campaign has also been promoted by Peruvian chef Gaston Acurio, the owner of multiple restaurants worldwide as well as a co-creator of the documentary \"Per√∫ Sabe\", along with Spanish chef Ferran Adri√†.\n\nIn September 2012, the United States officially launched its Culinary Diplomacy Partnership Initiative. More than 80 chefs, including White House Executive Chef Cristeta Comerford, former White House Executive Pastry Chef William Yosses, and Spanish-born chef Jos√© Andr√©s, were named to be members of the \"American Chef Corps.\" The initiative is organized by the United States State Department Office of Protocol. One goal of the program is to send members of the Chef Corps to American embassies abroad on public diplomacy missions to teach about American cuisine.\n\n\nAt the summit of culinary diplomacy is Le Club des Chefs des Chefs, or the Leaders' Chefs' Club. Created in 1977 by Gilles Bragard, former CEO of Bragard Uniforms, the club annually brings together more than 25 chefs of heads of state to meet and discuss their work. Current club members include Executive Chef Cristeta Comerford from The White House, Chef Bernard Vaussion, formerly of the √âlys√©e Palace, Chef Mark Flanagan, Chef to Her Majesty the Queen of the United Kingdom, and Chef Machindra Kasture, Chef to the Indian President.\n\nThe 2013 meeting of the club was hosted by White House Chef Cristeta Comerford and took place in New York City and Washington, DC. The chefs met with United Nations Secretary General Ban Ki-Moon as well as United States President Barack Obama. \n\nThe 2014 meeting of the club was hosted by Buckingham Palace chef Mark Flanagan, where the group met Queen Elizabeth II. \n\nThe 2015 meeting of the club took place in Switzerland and Italy, where the club visited Expo 2015 in Milan.\n"}

E-epidemiology also refers to the large-scale epidemiological studies that are increasingly conducted through distributed global collaborations enabled by the Internet.\n\nThe traditional approach in performing epidemiological trials by using paper questionnaires is both costly and time-consuming. The questionnaires have to be transformed to analyzable data and a large number of personnel are needed throughout the procedure.\nModern communication tools, such as the web, cell phones and other current and future communication devices, allow rapidly and cost-efficient assembly of data on determinants for lifestyle and health for broad segments of the population. Modern IT technology provides means for storage, organization and retrieval of large amounts of biological and lifestyle data, which will ensure more data and more reliable statistical results. Efficient number crunching computing, using modern analytical tools and simulation based inference procedures allow knowledge to be extracted from the resulting large and complex data-structures. \nWeb portals directly connected to the studies enables instant feedback and information to the participants. It also allows animations and other web based tools linked to the questionnaires, which can increase the interactivity and facilitates flow of information between the study participant and the study centre. The web portal will also generate a possibility for the Universities to carry out the third assignment, which is to spread the knowledge generated at the University to the public.\n\nImportant aspects of e-epidemiology include the development of security and confidentiality preserving solutions to protect individual integrity and research data ownership. But entering an epidemiological trial via the Internet is probably safer then traditional manners. Accurate security programmes and firewalls are a critical condition for handling personal records over the Internet.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "446637", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=446637", "title": "Gestalt theoretical psychotherapy", "text": "Gestalt theoretical psychotherapy\n\nGestalt theoretical psychotherapy is a method of psychotherapy based strictly on Gestalt psychology. Its origins go back to the 1920s when Gestalt psychology founder Max Wertheimer, Kurt Lewin and their colleagues and students started to apply the holistic and systems theoretical Gestalt psychology concepts in the field of psychopathology and clinical psychology Many developments in psychotherapy in the following decades drew from these early beginnings, like e.g. group psychoanalysis (S. Foulkes), Gestalt therapy (Laura and Fritz Perls Goodman and others), or Katathym-imaginative Psychotherapy (Hanscarl Leuner). In Europe Gestalt theoretical psychotherapy in its own right has been initiated and formulated on this basis by the German Gestalt psychologist and psychotherapist Hans-J√ºrgen P. Walter and his colleagues in Germany and Austria. Walter, a student of Gestalt psychologist Friedrich Hoeth, was influenced to form the core of his theoretical concept on the basis of the work of Gestalt theorists Max Wertheimer, Wolfgang K√∂hler, Kurt Koffka, Kurt Lewin, and Wolfgang Metzger. Walter‚Äôs first publication on Gestalt theoretical psychotherapy came out in 1977 \"Gestalttheorie und Psychotherapie\" (Gestalt Theory and Psychotherapy), which is now on its third edition (1994). The majority of the extensive literature on Gestalt theoretical psychotherapy which has been published in the decades since then is in the German language. However, Walter's articles \"Cognitive Behavior Therapy and Gestalt-Theoretical Psychotherapy\" and \"What do Gestalt therapy and Gestalt theory have to do with each other?\" have been published also in English, as well as Gerhard Stemberger's more recent introductory article \"Diagnostics in Gestalt Theoretical Psychotherapy\". \n\nGestalt Theoretical Psychotherapy in this form has gained popularity predominately in German speaking countries. It is officially approved by the Austrian government as a scientific psychotherapy method under the Austrian Psychotherapy Act. \n\nOne of the most striking characteristics of Gestalt Theoretical Psychotherapy is the key role of the epistemological grounding position of Gestalt theory (critical realism) and its applicability to the fundamental, theoretical, and practical problems in psychotherapy. In Gestalt Theoretical Psychotherapy this is closely bound up with the basic methodological approach (holistic, phenomenological, experimental) of Gestalt theory, its system theoretical approach, and its specific psychophysical and psychological approach. \n\nGerhard Stemberger‚Äôs \"Diagnostics in Gestalt Theoretical Psychotherapy\", provides insight into the concept and process of Gestalt theoretical psychotherapy. The Gestalt theoretical psychotherapy therapeutic process is a relationship between two individuals in which both the therapist and client develop an egalitarian attitude. An egalitarian attitude is the concept that everyone is equal. The diagnostic process and the therapeutic process are inseparable to Gestalt theoretical psychotherapists. The therapist is responsible for supporting the client in discovering their specific and individual feelings and problems. Gestalt theoretical psychotherapists believe that an individual cannot be forced into doing things that are against the individual‚Äôs nature; therefore it is crucial for the therapist to adapt diagnostic exploration to the individual‚Äôs capabilities. The therapeutic process requires no strict or set schedule, and the speed of the process varies for each individual. ‚ÄúForce-field analysis‚Äù, a concept from Kurt Lewin, is a phenomenological procedure in which the therapist and client look for opportunities to explore specific attributes of the client‚Äôs life space, their driving forces, and barriers. This can occur in therapy through dialogue, allowing the client to experience their feelings through speaking. The anthropological model in Gestalt theoretical psychotherapy is the belief that the therapist should not only focus on ‚Äòinner components‚Äô of the client, but also focus on the interaction between the client and their environment that effect their experience and behavior.\n\nGestalt theoretical psychotherapy is related to but different from Fritz Perls' Gestalt therapy in its theoretical foundation. Mary Henle has pointed out the differences between Gestalt theory in its original sense and the Perls'ian understanding of Gestalt.\nWith her analysis however, she restricts herself explicitly to only three of Perls' books from 1969 and 1972, leaving out Perls' earlier work, and Gestalt therapy in general as a psychotherapy method.\nIt must also be mentioned that Gestalt theoretical psychotherapy adopts techniques from Gestalt therapy as Walter points out.\n"}

It was described by the World Health Organization as the largest public health initiative in history.\n\nThe strategy for the eradication of polio rests on immunizing every at risk child until there is no one left for the disease to transmit to and the disease eventually dies out. The Initiative is spearheaded by the following Organizations:\n\n\nKey tactics used by the GPEI include strengthening childhood immunization through oral vaccines, conducting surveillance \nthrough investigation of acute flaccid paralysis cases among children under 15 years old (in order to determine areas where the virus is truly eradicated), and conducting \"mop up\" campaigns in areas where cases of polio have been identified.\n\nBy 2012 the GPEI had raised 9 billion dollars in funding and in alone 2011 the GPEI received a 1.1 billion dollars, for a budget of 0.98 billion dollars. 30% of their funding came from the Gates Foundation 30% from developed governments, 27% from countries at risk of polio, and the rest was made up of donations from non profits, private funders, and other foundations. It is likely that the GPEI will become almost entirely funded by private organizations in the future.\n\nIn 1995 a Global Certification Commission was created to oversee the certification of the eradication of wild-type poliovirus transmissions. Certification for the six WHO regions requires all of the countries in that region to be certified by the commission. By the year 2000 both the regions of the Western Pacific and the Americas met the criteria to be certified free of polio transmissions. By 2012 the initial number of estimated cases in 1988 of 350,000 across 125 endemic countries has dropped to 650 confirmed cases. In addition the 3 of the six WHO regions are now certified polio eradicated (Europe, the Americas, The West Pacific). India, which many thought would face the greatest challenge to eradication was removed from the list of endemic countries. According to the most recent study by the GPEI, in 2016, there are only three countries still listed as endemic, Nigeria, Afghanistan and Pakistan.\n\nIt is owing to this dramatic reduction that the funding for the GPEI will likely soon come entirely from private donors and foundations such as the Gates Foundation instead of from individual countries. In fact Bill Gates has listed polio eradication as one of his \"Top Personal Priorities\".\n\nA 2011 study by Middlebury College (commissioned by the Gates Foundation) indicated a list recommendations for how the GPEI should operate moving forward:\n\n\nThe final steps of polio eradication for the GPEI, or what is known as the \"endgame\" are as follows:\n\n"}
{"id": "21463614", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=21463614", "title": "Gym", "text": "Gym\n\nA gymnasium, also known as a gym, is a covered location for gymnastics, athletics, and gymnastic services. The word is derived from the ancient Greek \"gymnasium\". They are commonly found in athletic and fitness centers, and as activity and learning spaces in educational institutions. \"Gym\" is also slang for \"fitness center\", which is often an area for indoor recreation.\n\nGymnasia apparatus such as barbells, parallel bars, jumping board, running path, tennis-balls, cricket field, fencing area, and so forth are used as exercises. In safe weather, outdoor locations are the most conducive to health. Gyms were popular in ancient Greece. Their curricula included Gymnastica militaria or self-defense, gymnastica medica, or physical therapy to help the sick and injured, and gymnastica athletica for physical fitness and sports, from boxing to dancing.\n\nThese gymnasia also had teachers of wisdom and philosophy. Community gymnastic events were done as part of the celebrations during various village festivals. In ancient Greece there was a phrase of contempt, \"He can neither swim nor write.\" After a while, however, Olympic athletes began training in buildings specifically designed for them. Community sports never became as popular among ancient Romans as it had among the ancient Greeks. Gyms were used more as a preparation for military service or spectator sports. During the Roman Empire, the gymnastic art was forgotten. In the Dark Ages there were sword fighting tournaments and of chivalry; and after gunpowder was invented sword fighting began to be replaced by the sport of fencing. There were schools of dagger fighting and wrestling and boxing.\n\nThen in the 18th century, Salzmann, German clergyman, opened a gym in Thuringia teaching bodily exercises, including running and swimming. Clias and Volker established gyms in London, and in 1825, Doctor Beck, a German immigrant, established the first gymnasium in the United States. It was found that gym pupils lose interest in doing the same exercises, partly because of age. Variety in exercises included skating, dancing, and swimming. Some gym activities can be done by 6 to 8 year-olds while age 16 has been considered mature enough for boxing and horseback riding.\n\nIn Ancient Greece, the \"gymnasion\" (Œ≥œÖŒºŒΩŒ¨œÉŒπŒøŒΩ) was a locality for both physical and intellectual education of young men. The latter meaning of intellectual education persisted in Greek, German and other languages to denote a certain type of school providing secondary education, the gymnasium, whereas in English the meaning of physical education pertained in the word 'gym'.\n\nThe Greek word \"gymnasium\" means \"school for naked exercise\" and was used to designate a locality for the education of young men, including physical education (\"gymnastics\", i.e. exercise) which was customarily performed naked, as well as bathing, and studies. For the Greeks, physical education was considered as important as cognitive learning. Most Greek \"gymnasia\" had libraries that could be utilized after relaxing in the baths.\n\nThe first recorded gymnasiums date back to over 3000 years ago in ancient Persia, where they were known as \"zurkhaneh\", areas that encouraged physical fitness. The larger Roman Baths often had attached fitness facilities, the baths themselves sometimes being decorated with mosaics of local champions of sport. Gyms (\"i.e\"., places for gymnastics) in Germany were an outgrowth of the \"Turnplatz\", an outdoor space for gymnastics, which was promoted by German educator Friedrich Jahn and the Turners, a nineteenth-century political and gymnastic movement. The first indoor gymnasium in Germany was probably the one built in Hesse in 1852 by Adolph Spiess, an enthusiast for boys' and girls' gymnastics in schools.\nThrough worldwide colonization, Great Britain expanded its national interest in sports and games to many countries. In the 1800s, programs were added to schools and college curricula that emphasized health, strength, and bodily measure. Sports drawn from European and British cultures thrived as college students and upper-class clubs financed competition. As a result, towns began building playgrounds that furthered interest in sports and physical activity. In the United States, the Turner movement thrived in the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. The first Turners group was formed in London in 1848. The Turners built gymnasia in several cities like Cincinnati and St. Louis which had large German American populations. These gyms were utilized by adults and youth. For example, a young Lou Gehrig would frequent the Turner gym in New York City with his father.\n\nThe Boston Young Men's Christian Union claims to be \"America's First Gym\". The YMCA first organized in Boston in 1851 and a smaller branch opened in Rangasville in 1852. Ten years later there were some two hundred YMCAs across the country, most of which provided gymnasia for exercise, games, and social interaction.\n\nThe 1920s was a decade of prosperity that witnessed the building of large numbers of public high schools with a gymnasium, an idea founded by Nicolas Isaranga. Over the course of the 20th century, gymnasia have been reconceptualized to accommodate the popular team and individual games and sports that have supplanted gymnastics in the school curriculum.\n\nToday, gymnasia are commonplace in the United States. They are in virtually all U.S. colleges and high schools, as well as almost all middle schools and elementary schools. These facilities are used for physical education, intramural sports, and school gatherings. The number of gyms in the U.S. has more than doubled since the late 1980s. \n\n\n"}

The 58-year-old was extremely healthy and active for his age, jogging in the Vatican gardens to the horror of Vatican staff, who informed him that his jogging could be seen by tourists climbing to the summit of the dome of St. Peter's Basilica. The pope's response, according to media reports, was \"so what?\" When the cost of installing a swimming pool in his summer residence was queried by cardinals, John Paul joked that it was \"cheaper than another conclave\".\n\nJohn Paul's obvious physical fitness and looks earned much comment in the media following his election, which compared his health and trim figure to the poor health of John Paul I and Paul VI, the portliness of Pope John XXIII and the constant claims of ailments of Pius XII. The only modern pope with a keep-fit regime had been Pope Pius XI (r: 1922-1939) who was an avid mountain climber. An \"Irish Independent\" article in the 1980s labelled John Paul \"the keep-fit pope\".\n\nHowever, after over twenty-five years on the papal throne, two assassination attempts (one of which resulted in severe physical injury to the Pope), and a number of cancer scares, John Paul's physical health declined.\n\nThe 1981 assassination attempt was costlier to his overall health than was generally known by the public at the time. Rushed to the Agostino Gemelli University Polyclinic to undergo emergency surgery, he experienced profound bleeding leading to a dangerous fall in blood pressure and to cardiac arrest, which was however successfully defibrillated. He received the Anointing of the Sick (formerly known as \"Last Rites\"). Despite difficulties with extensive blood transfusions, which are speculated to have transmitted cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection, surgery was eventually successful. The bullet had passed completely through the body, puncturing the intestines and necessitating a colostomy. Seven weeks later, discussions were held about reversing the colostomy and eight of nine doctors voted against it, arguing the Pope was still too weak from the CMV infection. Saying \"I don't want to continue half dead and half alive\", the Pope effectively overruled his physicians and the reversal was done successfully on August 5, 1981.\n\nDespite the shooting and the complications during recovery, John Paul remained in good physical condition throughout the 1980s, and remained active as well. During the 1990s John Paul's health began to decline. A benign intestinal tumor was removed in 1992; he experienced two falls in 1993 and 1994 which dislocated his shoulder and broke his femur respectively; and he underwent an appendectomy in 1996. In December 1995, he had to suspend his \"urbi et orbi\" blessing on Christmas Day after a dizzy spell.\n\nAn orthopaedic surgeon confirmed in 2001 that Pope John Paul II was suffering from Parkinson's disease, as international observers had suspected for some time; this was acknowledged publicly by the Vatican in 2003. Despite difficulty speaking more than a few sentences at a time, trouble hearing and severe osteoarthrosis, he continued to tour the world, although rarely walking in public. Some of those who met him late in his life said that although physically he was in poor shape, mentally he remained fully alert.\n\nHowever, that claim was disputed by among others Rowan Williams, the Archbishop of Canterbury, and Mary McAleese, the President of Ireland, in their accounts of meetings with him in 2003. After John Paul II's death, Williams told \"The Sunday Times\" of a meeting with the Pope, during which he had paid tribute to one of John Paul's encyclicals. According to Williams, John Paul II showed no recognition . An aide whispered in the pope's ear, but was overheard reminding John Paul about the encyclical. However the Pope still showed no recognition. Papal critic John Cornwell claimed that, after Williams and his entourage left, the Pope turned to an aide and asked \"tell me, who were those people?\" \n\nAccording to Cornwell, Mary McAleese told the British Catholic newspaper \"The Universe\" of a visit as President of Ireland to John Paul where he struggled to talk about the Irish College in Rome, where Irish seminarians in the city are trained and to which the Pope prior to his election had often travelled. \"He wanted to be reminded of where the Irish College was, and when he heard that it was very close to St. John Lateran's basilica he wanted to be reminded where that was too.\"\n\nOn 1 February 2005, the Pope was taken to the Gemelli Hospital suffering from acute inflammation and spasm of the larynx, brought on by a bout of influenza. He was released, but in late February 2005 he began having trouble breathing, and he was rushed back. A tracheotomy was performed, allowing him to breathe more easily, but limiting his speaking ability, to which he reacted with evident frustration during a failed attempt at public speaking from the window of the hospital ward.\n\nOn Palm Sunday (20 March 2005) the Pope made a brief appearance at his window and silently waved an olive branch to pilgrims. Two days later there were renewed concerns for his health after reports stated that he had taken a turn for the worse and was not responding to medication. By the end of the month, speculation was growing. The Vatican officials confirmed that he was nearing death when on March 31, 2005 at around 11:00 am, the pope, who had gone to the chapel to celebrate Mass, was beset by strong shivers which was followed by high fever because of a urinary tract infection. Despite the use of antibiotics, the disease continues and he developed sepsis and multiple organ failure. He was not rushed to the hospital again, however, and equipment for medical monitoring was brought to his residence in the Vatican, where he was followed by a team of top physicians. On April 2 at 9:37 pm, he died in his apartment on 2 April 2005 at 84 years and 319 days of age, 46 days before his 85th birthday. The pope is reported to have died looking towards the window as he prayed, raising his right hand as if he is aware of the crowds present in St. Peter's Square where he made an effort to say \"Amen\" and his life ended. The illumination of a third light in the papal apartment makes some onlookers in the square knew that the end had come. His death was confirmed when an electrocardiogram signal remained flat for more than 20 minutes.\n\nThe Pope was the third-longest serving Pope ever in history, after the first Pope St. Peter and Pope Pius IX. He died after 26 years and 162 days of papacy. He was buried in presence of millions on 8 April 2005.\n"}

Costa Rica offers some of the best health care in Central America. Both the private and public health care systems are always being upgraded. New hospitals, new clinics, new machines, and improvement in staff and training. Statistics from the World Health Organization (WHO) frequently place Costa Rica in the top country rankings in the world for long life expectancy. WHO's 2000 survey ranked Costa Rica as having the 36th best health care system, placing it one spot above the United States at the time. In addition, the UN (United Nations) has ranked Costa Rica‚Äôs public health system within the top 20 worldwide and the number 1 in Latin America.\n\nIn the early 1970s, the Ministry of Heath was heavily subsidized by foreign aid. However, by 1977, health programs had been so successful that US Aid for International Development in the sector was ended, as the country was found \"too healthy\" to continue being a recipient. In 2001, total spending on health care was 7% of GDP, with 3/4 of that being the public sector. Currently, costs tend to be much less than doctor, hospital, and prescription costs in the U.S. The country spends one tenth as much per capita on health care as the United States, focusing on preventive care.\n\nThe Costa Rican Social Security Fund or \"Caja Costarricense de Seguro Social\" (as it is known in Spanish) is in charge of most of the nation's public health sector. Its role in public health (as the administrator of health institutions) is key in Costa Rica, playing an important part in the state's national health policy making. Worker and employer contribution are mandated by law, under the principle of solidarity. Workers need to be cover by a \"poliza de riesgo del trabajo\" an insurance policy that complements the health care provided by the \"Caja\" for injuries related to labor risks.\n\nCaja services are guaranteed to all residents, including the uninsured. In 1989 this was expanded to include undocumented immigrants as well, which constituted up to 8% of the population at the time. The percent of residents with health insurance increased gradually, as the program was originally only intended for urban workers. It was not until 1961 that universal mandatory coverage became a stated goal. After reaching a peak of 92% coverage in 1990, rates have remained around 88%. 12% of the insured are low-income residents who are eligible to have their coverage paid entirely by the state, based on a means-test. 87% of the uninsured enter a hospital via the emergency room, compared to only 58% of the insured.\n\nEmergency care is provided free of charge to all residents. This governmental entity's functions encompass both the administrative and functional aspects. It has the obligation (as a public institution) to formulate and execute health programs that are both preventive (such as: vaccination, informational, fumigation, etc.) and healing (such as: surgery, radiation therapy, pharmacy, clinical, etc.) in nature. Services \"are aimed disproportionately\" toward underprivileged Nicaraguan and Colombian immigrants and indigenous communities. Spending is relatively progressive, with the poorest quintile receiving 29% of spending while the richest quintile only receives 11%.\n\nIn 2000, 90% of the country's doctors were employed by the public sector, but 1/3 of those also maintained a private practice. During the decade of the 1990s the percentage of all medical staff (not just doctors) who worked in the private sector increased from 10% to almost 25%. As more doctors opt for the more profitable field of private practice, especially in relation to medical tourism, the government has resorted to hiring around 100 Cuban doctors annually to work in the public sector, as of 2010.\n\nAlongside universal health care the government also provides basic dental care. However, this does not include most orthodontic procedures, such as braces.\n\nThe Equipos B√°scios de Atenci√≥n Integral en Salud (EBAIS), or Comprehensive Basic Health Care Team, began operating in 1995, under control of the Social Security Fund. The program had been proposed two years earlier by a bipartisan committee of experts set up by the president to redress decreases in the quality of services that had occurred over the preceding decade. The goal of the program is to ensure that all citizens have access to medical care, including rural residents. EBAIS employees are divided into teams of about five members, including one doctor. Team members visit people at their homes to vaccinate, offer medical advice, check vitals, and dispense medication. They also rectify any standing water situations they observe, which otherwise act as breeding grounds for mosquitoes and their associated diseases. EBAIS designates certain residences as high-risk due to subs-standard housing and amenities or risky health conditions (eg. teenage pregnancy). Members also address the health of patients' pets, such as ensuring that they are up to date on all necessary vaccinations. There are nearly 1,000 teams, each overseeing the health of 3,500-4,000 individuals.\n\nAfter an original rejection, $9 million was later granted for the creation of EBAIS by the World Bank. The rest of the $50 million price tag was paid for by the Social Security Fund.\n\nThe Costa Rican Social Security Fund is also charged with the administration of the public pension system.\n\nCosta Rica is a popular destination for medical tourism because of the beautiful surroundings, low costs, abundance of bilingual medical personnel, and medical reputation. Over 40,000 Americans come to the country annually as medical tourists. Private insurance plans are available through the government-owned insurance company(INS). Private plans include dental work, optometry, well-visits and annual check-ups. 80% of the costs are covered for prescription drugs, certain medical exams, sick visits and hospitalization. Surgeon and aesthetician costs are covered at full cost. Currently, private medical insurance costs about $60‚Äì$250/month per person, depending on gender, age, other factors. Reasons for opting for private health care include shorter wait times and the ability to choose one's doctor. Around 30% of the population utilizes private health services at least once a year, according to surveys. Costa Rica has three internationally accredited private hospitals. The four largest private hospitals in Costa Rica are CIMA in the suburbs of San Jose, Cl√≠nica Biblica in the center of San Jose, Cl√≠nica Cat√≥lica and Hospital Clinica UNIBE in the suburbs of San Jose. Domestic private health insurance was not legalized until 2006. International private insurance companies were not allowed to operate in the country until a Free Trade Agreement was signed with the United States in 2009.\n\nMany drugs (like birth control pills, high cholesterol medication, migraine medicine, etc.) are available in Costa Rica without a prescription. Many common problems can be accurately diagnosed and treated by pharmacists. Also, most major pharmacies have a doctor on staff. Most Costa Ricans head to the pharmacy first and consult with the pharmacist or doctor on staff; if he or she can not diagnose you or believe you need further treatment, you will be sent to the hospital.\n\nNg√∂be women are considered \"sick\" (\"bren\") while pregnant, and pregnancy is almost never discussed, even during birth. When the baby is deemed healthy, people consider it safe to acknowledge the pregnancy. Many women have traditionally given birth in their homes, with the help of their mother or a midwife. The government has established some women's clinics in Ngobe territory, seeking to improve women's health. The staff of San Vito Hospital, Coto Brus have had to adapt some of their practices to accommodate the women's culture and to encourage traditional midwives to come to the hospital.\n\nAbortion in Costa Rica is restricted to situations that preserve the life or physical health of the mother. Abortions are illegal in cases of rape or incest, for social or economic reasons or when the unborn child suffers from medical problems or birth defects.\n\nIt is illegal to smoke in all public vehicles, public buildings and recreation areas such as parks, stadia etc.\n"}

{"id": "24581929", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=24581929", "title": "History of narcissism", "text": "History of narcissism\n\nThe concept of excessive selfishness has been recognized throughout history. The term \"narcissism\" is derived from the Greek mythology of Narcissus, but was only coined at the close of the nineteenth century.\n\nSince then, narcissism has become a household word; in analytic literature, given the great preoccupation with the subject, the term is used more than almost any other'.\n\nThe meaning of narcissism has changed over time. Today narcissism \"refers to an interest in or concern with the self along a broad continuum, from healthy to pathological ... including such concepts as self-esteem, self-system, and self-representation, and true or false self\".\n\nNarcissus was a handsome Greek youth who rejected the desperate advances of the nymph Echo. As punishment, he was doomed to fall in love with his own reflection in a pool of water. Unable to consummate his love, Narcissus 'lay gazing enraptured into the pool, hour after hour', and finally pined away, changing into a flower that bears his name, the narcissus.\n\nThe story was retold in Latin by Ovid in his Metamorphoses, in which form it would have great influence on medieval and Renaissance culture. 'Ovid's tale of Echo and Narcissus...weaves in and out of most of the English examples of the Ovidian narrative poem'; and 'allusions to the story of Narcissus...play a large part in the poetics of the Sonnets' of Shakespeare. Here the term used was 'self-love...Feed'st thy light's flame with self-substantial fuel'. Francis Bacon used the same term: 'it is the nature of extreme self-lovers, as they will set a house on fire, and it were but to roast their eggs...those that (as Cicero says of Pompey) are \"sui amantes sine rivali\"...lovers of themselves without rivals'.\n\nByron at the start of the nineteenth century used the same term, describing how, \"Self-love for ever creeps out, like a snake, to sting anything which happens...to stumble on it.\" while Baudelaire wrote of 'as vigorous a growth in the heart of natural man as self-love', as well as of those who 'like Narcissuses of fat-headedness...are contemplating the crowd, as though it were a river, offering them their own image'.\n\nBy mid-century, however, egotism was perhaps an equally common expression for self-absorption‚Äî'egotists...made acutely conscious of a self, by the torture in which it dwells'‚Äîthough still with 'curious suggestions of the Narcissus legend' in the background. At the century's close, the term as we now know it finally emerged, with Havelock Ellis, the English sexologist, writing a short paper in 1927 on its coining, in which he 'argued that the priority should in fact be divided between himself and Paul N√§cke, explaining that the term \"narcissus-like\" had been used by him in 1898 as a description of a psychological attitude, and that N√§cke in 1899 had introduced the term \"Narcismus\" to describe a sexual perversion'.\n\nThe twentieth century has largely defined the concept in psychological terms, with Otto Rank publishing in 1911 the first psychoanalytical paper specifically concerned with narcissism, linking it to vanity and self-admiration.\n\nErnest Jones tells us that 'at a meeting of the Vienna Psycho-Analytical Society on 10 November 1909 Freud had declared that narcissism was a necessary intermediate stage between auto-erotism and object-love'. The following year in his \"Leonardo\" he described publicly for the first time how 'the growing youngster...finds his love objects on the path of \"narcissism\", since Greek myths call a youth Narcissus, whom nothing pleased so much as his own mirror image'. Although Freud only published a single paper exclusively devoted to narcissism called On Narcissism: An Introduction., in 1914, 'Narcissism was soon to take a central place in his thinking'.\n\nFreud suggested that exclusive self-love might not be as abnormal as previously thought and might even be a common component in the human psyche. He argued that narcissism \"is the libidinal complement to the egoism of the instinct of self-preservation,\" or, more simply, the desire and energy that drives one‚Äôs instinct to survive. He referred to this as \"primary narcissism\".\n\nAccording to Freud, people are born without a sense of themselves as individuals, or ego. The ego develops during infancy and the early part of childhood, only when the outside world, usually in the form of parental controls and expectations, intrudes upon primary narcissism, teaching the individual about the nature and standards of his social environment from which he can form the \"ideal ego\", an image of the perfect self towards which the ego should aspire. 'As it evolved, the ego distanced itself from primary narcissism, formed an ego-ideal, and proceeded to cathect objects'.\n\nFreud regarded all libidinous drives as fundamentally sexual and suggested that \"ego libido\" (libido directed inwards to the self) cannot always be clearly distinguished from \"object-libido\" (libido directed to persons or objects outside oneself).\n\nAn aspect frequently associated with primary narcissism appears in an earlier essay, 'Totem and Taboo,' in which Freud describes his observations of children and primitive people. What he observed was called magical thinking, such as the belief that a person can impact reality by wishing or willpower. It demonstrates a belief in the self as powerful and able to change external realities, which Freud believed was part of normal human development.\n\nAccording to Freud, \"secondary narcissism\" occurs when the libido withdraws from objects outside the self, above all the mother, producing a relationship to social reality that includes the potential for megalomania. 'This megalomania has no doubt come into being at the expense of object-libido...This leads us to look upon the narcissism which arises through the drawing on of object-cathexes as a secondary one, superimposed upon a primary narcissism'. For Freud, while both primary and secondary narcissism emerge in normal human development, problems in the transition from one to the other can lead to pathological narcissistic disorders in adulthood.\n\n\"This state of secondary narcissism constituted object relations of the narcissistic type\", according to Freud, something he went on to explore further in \"Mourning and Melancholia\"‚Äîconsidered one of Freud's most profound contributions to object relations theory, and constituting the overall principles of object relations and narcissism as concepts.\n\nAccording to Freud, to care for someone is to convert ego-libido into object-libido by giving some self-love to another person, which leaves less ego-libido available for primary narcissism and protecting and nurturing the self. When that affection is returned so is the libido, thus restoring primary narcissism and self-worth. Any failure to achieve, or disruption of, this balance causes psychological disturbances. In such a case, primary narcissism can be restored only by withdrawing object-libido (also called \"object-love\") to replenish ego-libido.\n\nAccording to Freud, as a child grows, and his ego develops, he is constantly giving of his self-love to people and objects, the first of which is usually his mother. This diminished self-love should be replenished by the affection and caring returned to him.\n\nKaren Horney saw narcissism quite differently from Freud, Kohut and other mainstream psychoanalytic theorists in that she did not posit a primary narcissism but saw the narcissistic personality as the product of a certain kind of early environment acting on a certain kind of temperament. For her, narcissistic needs and tendencies are not inherent in human nature.\n\nNarcissism is different from Horney's other major defensive strategies or solutions in that it is not compensatory. Self-idealization is compensatory in her theory, but it differs from narcissism. All the defensive strategies involve self-idealization, but in the narcissistic solution it tends to be the product of indulgence rather than of deprivation. The narcissist's self-esteem is not strong, however, because it is not based on genuine accomplishments.\n\nHeinz Kohut explored further the implications of Freud's perception of narcissism. He maintained that a child will tend to fantasize about having a grandiose self and ideal parents. He claimed that deep down, all people retain a belief in their own perfection and the perfection of anything they are part of. As a person matures, grandiosity gives way to self-esteem, and the idealization of the parent becomes the framework for core values. It is when psychological trauma disrupts this process that the most primitive and narcissistic version of the self remains unchanged. Kohut called such conditions narcissistic personality disorder, 'in which the merging with and detaching from an archaic self-object play the central role...narcissistic union with the idealized self-object'.\n\nKohut suggested narcissism as part of a stage in normal development, in which caregivers provide a strong and protective presence with which the child can identify that reinforces the child's growing sense of self by mirroring his good qualities. If the caregivers fail to provide adequately for their child, the child grows up with a brittle and flawed sense of self. 'Kohut's innovative pronouncement...became a veritable manifesto in the United States...The age of \"normal narcissism\" had arrived'\n\nKohut also saw beyond the negative and pathological aspects of narcissism, believing it is a component in the development of resilience, ideals and ambition once it has been transformed by life experiences or analysis‚Äîthough critics objected that his theory of how 'we become attached to ideals and values, instead of to our own archaic selves...fits the individual who escapes from bad inner negativity into idealized objects outside'.\n\nOtto Kernberg uses the term \"narcissism\" to refer to the role of self in the regulation of self-esteem.\n\nHe believed normal, infantile narcissism depends on the affirmation of others and the acquisition of desirable and appealing objects, which should later develop into healthy, mature self-esteem. This healthy narcissism depends upon an integrated sense of self that incorporates images of the internalized affirmation of those close to the person and is regulated by the super ego and ego ideal, internal mental structures that assure the person of his worth and that he deserves his own respect.\n\nThe failure of infantile narcissism to develop in this healthy adult form becomes a pathology.\n\n'Melanie Klein's...descriptions of infantile omnipotence and megalomania provided important insights for the clinical understanding of narcissistic states. In 1963, writing on the psychopathology of narcissism, Herbert Rosenfeld was especially concerned to arrive at a better definition of object-relationships and their attendant defense mechanisms in narcissism'.\n\nD. W. Winnicott's 'brilliant observations of the mother-child couple [also] throw considerable light on primary narcissism, which in the young child can be viewed as the extension of the mother's narcissism.\n\nLacan‚Äîbuilding on Freud's dictum that 'all narcissistic impulses operate from the ego and have their permanent seat in the ego'‚Äîused his own concept of the mirror stage to explore the narcissistic ego in terms of 'the essential structure it derives from its reference to the specular image...narcissism', in his battle against ego psychology.\n\n'B√©la Grunberger drew attention to a double orientation of narcissism‚Äîas both a need for self-affirmation and a tendency to restore permanent dependency. The active presence of narcissism throughout life led Grunberger to suggest treating it as an autonomous factor (1971)'.\n\n'Under the evocative title \"Life Narcissism, Death Narcissism\" (1983), Andr√© Green clarified the conflict surrounding the object of narcissism (whether a fantasy object or a real object) in its relationship to the ego. For Green, it was because narcissism affords the ego a certain degree of independence...that a lethal kind of narcissism must be considered, for the object is destroyed at the beginning of this process'; while in a further analysis, 'Green evokes physical narcissism, intellectual narcissism, and moral narcissism'‚Äîa set of divisions sometimes simplified into that between 'somatic narcissists who are obsessed with the body...[&] cerebral narcissists‚Äîpeople who build up their sense of magnificence out of an innate feeling of intellectual superiority'.\n\nNarcissistic personality disorder is a condition defined in DSM-IV, but a proposal has been made to remove it from the next edition, DSM-5, instead submerging it as a facet of the antagonism personality type domain.\n\nThe success of the term \"narcissism\" has led to something of an \"inflation of meanings...Some in fact exploited it as a handy term of abuse for modern culture or as a loose synonym for bloated self-esteem.\"\n\n\n"}

{"id": "1564181", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1564181", "title": "John Murray (oceanographer)", "text": "John Murray (oceanographer)\n\nSir John Murray KCB FRS FRSE FRSGS (3 March 1841 ‚Äì 16 March 1914) was a pioneering British oceanographer, marine biologist and limnologist. He is considered to be the father of modern oceanography.\n\nMurray was born at Cobourg, Canada West on 3 March 1841. He was the second son of Elizabeth Macfarlane and Robert Murray, an accountant. His parents had emigrated from Scotland to Ontario in about 1834. He went to school in London, Ontario and later to Cobourg College. In 1858, at the age of seventeen he returned to Scotland to live with his grandfather, John Macfarlane, and continue his education at Stirling High School. In 1864 he enrolled at University of Edinburgh to study medicine however he did not complete his studies and did not graduate.\n\nIn 1868 he joined the whaling ship, \"Jan Mayen\", as ship's surgeon and visited Spitsbergen and Jan Mayen Island. During the seven-month trip he collected marine specimens and recorded ocean currents, ice movements and the weather.\n\nOn his return to Edinburgh he re-entered the University to complete his studies (1868‚Äì72) in geology under Sir Archibald Geikie.\n\nIn 1872 Murray assisted in preparing scientific apparatus for the Challenger Expedition under the direction of the expedition's chief scientist, Charles Wyville Thomson. When a position on the expedition became available Murray joined the crew as a naturalist. During the four-year voyage he assisted in the research of the oceans including collecting marine samples, making and noting observations, and making improvements to marine instrumentation. After the expedition Murray was appointed Chief Assistant at the Challenger offices in Edinburgh where he managed and organised the collection. After Thomson's death in 1882 Murray became Director of the office and in 1896 published \"The Report on the Scientific Results of the Voyage of HMS Challenger\", a work of more than 50 volumes of reports.\n\nMurray renamed his house, on Boswall Road in northern Edinburgh, \"Challenger Lodge\" in recognition of the expedition. The building now houses St Columba's Hospice.\n\nIn 1884, Murray set up the Marine Laboratory at Granton, Edinburgh, the first of its kind in the United Kingdom. In 1894, this laboratory was moved to Millport, Isle of Cumbrae, on the Firth of Clyde, and became the University Marine Biological Station, Millport, the forerunner of today's Scottish Association for Marine Science at Dunstaffnage, near Oban, Argyll and Bute.\n\nAfter completing the Challenger Expedition reports, Murray began work surveying the fresh water lochs of Scotland. He was assisted by Frederick Pullar and over a period of 3 years they surveyed 15 lochs together. In 1901 Pullar drowned as a result of an ice skating accident which caused Murray to consider abandoning the survey work. However Pullar's father, Laurence Pullar, persuaded him to continue and gave ¬£10,000 towards completion of the survey. Murray coordinated a team of nearly 50 people who took more than 60,000 individual depth soundings and recorded other physical characteristics of the 562 lochs. The resulting 6 volume \"Bathymetrical Survey of the Fresh-Water Lochs of Scotland\" was published in 1910.\nThe cartographer John George Bartholomew, who strove to advance geographical and scientific understanding through his cartographic work, drafted and published all the maps of the Survey.\n\nIn 1909 Murray indicated to the International Council for the Exploration of the Sea that an oceanographic survey of the north Atlantic should be undertaken. After Murray agreed to pay all expenses, the Norwegian Government lent him the research ship \"Michael Sars\" and its scientific crew. He was joined on board by the Norwegian marine biologist Johan Hjort and the ship departed Plymouth in April 1910 for a four-month expedition to take physical and biological observations at all depths between Europe and North America. Murray and Hjort published their findings in \"The Depths of the Ocean\" in 1912 and it became a classic for marine naturalists and oceanographers.\n\nHe was the first to note the existence of the Mid-Atlantic Ridge and of oceanic trenches. He also noted the presence of deposits derived from the Saharan desert in deep ocean sediments and published a vast number of papers on his findings.\n\nOther awards included the Cuvier Prize and Medal from the Institut de France and the Humboldt Medal of the Gesellschaft f√ºr Erdkunde zu Berlin.\n\nHe was president of the Royal Scottish Geographical Society from 1898 to 1904.\n\nThe \"John Murray Laboratories\" at the University of Edinburgh, the \"John Murray Society\" at the University of Newcastle and the Scottish Environment Protection Agency research vessel, the S.V. \"Sir John Murray\", and the Murray Glacier are named after him.\n\n\"Cirrothauma murrayi\", an almost blind octopus that lives at depths from to and the Murrayonida order of sea sponges are named after Murray.\n\nIn 1911, Murray founded the Alexander Agassiz Medal which is awarded by the National Academy of Sciences, in memory of his friend Alexander Agassiz (1835‚Äì1910).\n\nAfter his death his estate funded the John Murray Travelling Studentship Fund and the 1933 John Murray \"Mabahiss\" Expedition to the Indian Ocean.\n\nMurray lived at Challenger Lodge (renamed after his expedition) on Boswall Road in Trinity, Edinburgh with commanding views over the Firth of Forth.\n\nMurray was killed when his car overturned ten miles west of his home on 16 March 1914 at Kirkliston near Edinburgh. He is buried in Dean Cemetery in Edinburgh on the central path of the north section in the original cemetery.\n\nHis home was converted into St Columba's Hospice in 1977.\n\n\n"}

She married George Faithfull in 1917. and after his death she married, in 1943, the writer and critic Cuthbert Worsley.\n\nFaithfull studied at the Slade School of Art throughout 1923 and 1924, before going to Paris to study at the Acad√©mie de la Grande Chaumi√®re. In 1933 she exhibited at the Salon des Artistes Francais in Paris. At the start of World War Two, Faithfull applied to work for the War Artists' Advisory Committee, WAAC. Although not given a full-time commission by WAAC, she was given facilities and permits to work. She used these to produce paintings depicting evacuee children and, later, scenes of American servicemen playing baseball in a London park, and these pieces were purchased by WAAC. During the war, Faithfull also worked for a time as a surgical artist at the new plastic surgery unit at the Queen Victoria Hospital in East Grinstead under Sir Archibald McIndoe. At the end of the war, Faithfull produced a triptych depicting the crowds gathered around Buckingham Palace, celebrating on VE-Day.\n\nAfter the war, Faithfull built a reputation as a portrait painter and exhibited widely with works shown at the Royal Academy, the Royal Society of British Artists and the New English Art Club. Both Kenneth Clark and Sir Edward Marsh acquired examples of her work for their private collections. In her later years she begin working in metal, creating figures of dancers and horses. Faithfull died in 1994 at St. Angelia's Convent in Bristol, where she had lived for several years.\n"}

L√º is one of the most widely known of the group of deities known as the Eight Immortals and considered by some to be the de facto leader. (The formal leader is more likely said to be Zhongli Quan or sometimes Iron-Crutch Li.) He is also a historical figure who was mentioned in the official history book \"History of Song\". L√º is widely considered to be one of the earliest masters of the tradition of neidan, or internal alchemy. He is depicted in art as being dressed as a scholar and he often bears a sword on his back that dispels evil spirits.\n\nL√º Dongbin is usually portrayed as a scholarly, clever man with a genuine desire to help people obtain wisdom/enlightenment and to learn the Tao. However, he is often portrayed as having some character \"flaws\", not an uncommon theme for the colorful Taoist immortals, all of whom in general have various eccentricities:\n\nHis name is L√º Y√°n, with Y√°n (Â∑ñ or Â≤© or Âñ¶) being the given name. D√≤ngbƒ´n is his courtesy name. He is called Master Pure-Yang (Á¥îÈôΩÂ≠ê Chunyang Zi), and is also called L√º the Progenitor (ÂëÇÁ•ñ l√º z≈≠) by some Daoist, especially those of the Quanzhen School. He was born in Jingzhao Prefecture (‰∫¨ÂÖÜÂ∫ú Jƒ´ngzh√†o F≈≠) around 796 CE during the Tang Dynasty\n\nWhen he was born, a fragrance allegedly filled the room. His birthday is said to be on the fourteenth day of the fourth month of the Chinese calendar. He had been very intelligent since childhood and had many academic achievements. However, according to one story, still unmarried by the age of 20, L√º twice took the top-level civil service exam to become a government official, but did not succeed.\n\nIn the first year of Tang Baoli (825 CE), he was a scholar for a period of time. He served as a county magistrate twice. Soon he was ruined by officialdom, abandoned his official position and retired to the mountains. Once you traveled to Chang'an Wine Cellar, you will be divorced by Zhengyang's real person. After the \"Ten Tests\", Zhongli QuanÔºàÈçæÈõ¢Ê¨ä Zhong LiquanÔºâ \"gives the way of the Golden Dan, because of the law,\" and finally becomes a fairyÔºåHe died in the Yellow Crane Tower in the 1016 CE in the Northern Song DynastyÔºàÈªÉÈ∂¥Ê®ì hu√°n…°h√®l√≥uÔºâ.\n\nThe legend has it that one night when L√º Yan was in Chang'an or Handan, he dozed off as his yellow millet was cooking in a hotel. He dreamed that he took the imperial exam and excelled, and thus was awarded a prestigious office and soon promoted to the position of vice minister (‰æçÈÉé sh√¨l√°ng). He then married the daughter of a prosperous household and had a son and a daughter. He was promoted again and again, and finally became the prime minister. However, his success and luck attracted jealousy of others, so he was accused of crimes that caused him to lose his office. His wife then betrayed him, his children were killed by bandits, and he lost all his wealth. As he was dying on the street in the dream, he woke up.\n\nAlthough in the dream, eighteen years had passed, the whole dream actually happened in the time it took his millet to cook. The characters from his dream were actually played by Zhongli Quan in order to make him realize that one should not put too much importance on transient glory and success. As a result, L√º went with Zhongli to discover and cultivate the Tao. This dream is known as \"Dream of the Yellow Millet\" (ÈªÉÁ≤±Â§¢ Hu√°ng Li√°ng M√®ng) and is described in a writing compiled by Ma Zhiyuan of the Yuan Dynasty.\n\nIn volume 82 of Song Dynasty scholar Li Fang's \"Extensive Records of the Taiping Era\", an earlier version of the story, L√º Dongbin was replaced by Student Lu (ÁõßÁîü L√∫ Shƒìng), and Zhongli Quan by Elder L√º (ÂëÇÁøÅ L«ö Wƒìng).\n\nThe exact age of L√º Yan when this incident occurred varies in the tellings, from 20 years of age to 40.\n\nA story has it that when in Chang An, L√º was tested by Zhongli Quan ten times before Quan took him in as a disciple and L√º subsequently became immortal. These ten trials are described below.\n\n\nThese 10 tests proved that L√º was a pure and dignified person and Master Zhongli was very satisfied and happy to take L√º to Nan San Her Ling to pass his secret to life and subsequently formed a \"Zhong-L√º Golden Dan\" school of Taoism. But L√º was not too fond of the secret and instead changed his formula for inner peace and benefits more human beings; many until today practiced such path to immortals. This is his major effort and contribution. He is said to have helped many to walk the right path and improve the health and living conditions of many people.\n\nSince the Northern Song Dynasty, there have been many stories and legends that are connected to L√º Dongbin. The stories were usually about L√º helping others to learn the Tao. According to the official History of the Song Dynasty („ÄäÂÆãÂè≤„Äã), L√º was seen several times visiting the house of Chen Tuan (Èô≥Êë∂), who was believed to be the first person to present to the public the Taijitu.\n\nThe kindness of L√º Dongbin is demonstrated in the Chinese proverb \"dog bites L√º Dongbin\" (ÁãóÂí¨ÂëÇÊ¥ûË≥ì g≈èu yƒÉo L«ö D√≤ngbƒ´n), which means an inability to recognize goodness and repay kindness with vice. Some say that the original proverb should actually be \"ÁãóÂí¨ÂëÇÊ¥ûË≥ìÔºå‰∏çË≠òÂ•Ω‰∫∫ÂøÉ,\" stemming from a story about the friendship between Gou Miao (ÁãóÂí¨) and L√º Dongbin, who both did for the other great favors, each of which seemed like a disservice initially, signifying the importance of having faith in one's friends.\n\nAccording to Richard Wilhelm, L√º was the founder of the School of the Golden Elixir of Life (Jin Dan Jiao), and originator of the material presented in the book \"Tai Yi Jin Hua Zong Zhi\" („ÄäÂ§™‰∏ÄÈáëËèØÂÆóÊó®„Äã), or The Secret of the Golden Flower. Also, according to Daoist legend, he is the founder of the internal martial arts style called \"Eight Immortals Sword\" (ÂÖ´‰ªôÂâë), considered to be one of the martial treasures of Wudangshan.\n\nAccording to one story, L√º's teacher Zhongli Quan became an immortal and was about to fly to heaven, while saying to L√º that if he kept practicing the Tao he would also be able to fly to heaven himself very soon. L√º Dongbin replied to his teacher that he'll fly to heaven only after he enlightens all the sentient beings on earth (another story says all his relatives). According to the book \"The Eight Immortals Achieving the Tao („ÄäÂÖ´‰ªôÂæóÈÅìÊë∂„Äã),\" in his previous incarnation, L√º Dongbin was a Taoist master and the teacher of Zhongli Quan.\n\nAccording to the Taoist book \"History of the Immortals\" („ÄäÊ≠∑‰ª£Á•û‰ªôÈÄöÈëí„Äã), L√º is the reincarnation of the ancient Sage-King \"Huang-Tan-Shi\" (ÁöáË¶ÉÊ∞è).\n\nAccording to Venerable Hsuan Hua, L√º is one of the transformations of Guanyin (Avalokite≈õvara) Bodhisattva.\n\nOne of most popular of L√º Dongbin's legends is his encounter with a prostitute named White Peony (Bai Mudan)\n\nThe most popular version comes from the Journey to the East novel. It is said that the immortal L√º Dongbin was greatly attracted to White Peony, one of the most beautiful courtesans in Luoyang. L√º Dongbin slept with her many times but never ejaculated, because he didn‚Äôt want to lose his Yang essence. \nUnfortunately Lu‚Äôs immortal colleague Iron-Crutch Li and He Xiangu taught Mudan how to make him ejaculate by tickling his groin. Finally White Peony successfully made L√º Dongbin ejaculate and absorbed his Yang essence. Later she cultivated herself and became immortal too.\n\nAnother version comes from Ba Xian Dedao novel. This version is more subtle and there is no sexual intercourse here.\nOne day the immortal L√º Dongbin transforms himself into a handsome scholar and tries to advise the famous prostitute White Peony. In their first encounter White Peony seduces him passionately, but he refuses to sleep with her. In their second encounter, L√º agrees to sleep with her. But as they walk to the bed, L√º suddenly cries that his stomach is painful, and faints. White Peony is very sorry about his condition and calls a doctor using her money (despite her pimp‚Äôs grumbling, who incites her to throw the sick L√º to the road). L√º (who is only pretending to be sick) is very pleased knowing Peony's merciful heart. In their third encounter, L√º Dongbin finally succeeds to persuade White Peony to leave her wayward life. She finally becomes immortal too.\n\nIn the opera version, White Peony is changed from a seductive prostitute to the daughter of a drugstore owner. One day L√º Dongbin comes to their store and makes trouble by asking for impossible medicines. Knowing her father's difficulty, Peony meets L√º and answers all of his question. From quarrelling they finally become lovers.\n\nIn 19th- and 20th-century Guangdong, belief in the powers of L√ºzu was strong. In the century after the 1840s, temples were founded which organized spirit writing seances, festivals for the birthdays of the gods, death rituals, and running schools, clinics, and disaster relief.\n\nIn the television show \"Jackie Chan Adventures\", Dongbin was shown to be the immortal who sealed away Shendu, The Fire Demon.\n\nJackie Chan portrayed L√º Dongbin in the film \"The Forbidden Kingdom\".\n\nIn Desolate Era, L√º Dongbin is portrayed as one of the True Yang Immortals.\n\n"}

Over the decades, with demand for healthcare providers increasing due to marked growth in the population of Kenya, training programs were implemented.\n\nIn 1908, nursing in Kenya began when missionaries who visited Kenya provided training. The first nurses were primarily male and were known as \"dressers.\" Their primary responsibilities included dressing wounds, administering injections, and managing hospitals.\n\nBefore 1950, nursing in Kenya was conducted without a formal framework. Most health care institutions provided in-service training for healthcare workers, to assist the whites in the provision of required healthcare, thus making it difficult to identify healthcare workers according to their level of training and scope of practice.In 1950 meeting of the Nurses and Midwives Council of Kenya members passed a resolution that formally described the different cadres of nurses who were practising nursing in Kenya at that time. The titles of State Registered Nurse, Kenya Registered Nurse, and Assistant Registered Nurse Grade 1 and 2 remained in force on the basis of Registration and Training.\n\nIn 1952, the Examination Sub-Committee held its first examination for Assistant Enrolled Nurses Grade I and II. Approval of training schools was required to be done by the relevant training schools sub-committee, whilst the inspection of schools would be done every three years.\n\nThe King George Hospital Kenyatta National Hospital became the first hospital to start the Kenya Registered Nurse training programme. The course was approved to run for 3 ¬Ω years, with the Preliminary Training Service (PTS) to extend over 3 months, followed by a period of 3 months ward rotation and 3 years of theory and clinical training.\n\n1980s there was a marked growth in the population of Kenya. As a result of the rapid development going on in the country at that time, there was an increase in rural-urban migration, resulting in an uneven distribution of resources, with particular reference to human resources. There was also a growing need for health care providers to engage in effective healthcare management strategies, to be able to reach every part of the population.\n1987 the Kenya Registered Community Health Nurse (KRCHN) training was commenced, to prepare nurses who would be able to give comprehensive care to the communities.\n1990s, due to expansion and emergence of complex disease patterns among populations such as HIV/AIDS, cancer, cardiac conditions, the Nursing Council of Kenya approved the preparation of nurses at bachelors level because the effective management of such patients requires highly skilled and trained personnel who would be able to engage in critical thinking and sound decision-making.\n\n2013,approved-nursing-courses-council-Kenya 19 programmes had been approved, as health care learning institutions continue to recognise the need to build capacity to facilitate health care management and practice at all levels.\n\nBefore the establishment of the Nursing Council of Kenya (NCK) under the Nurses Cap 257 of the Laws of Kenya, the activities of the Council were governed by Ordinances. Ordinance number 16 of 4 June 1946 was the first governing tool to be authorised by the Colony and Protectorate of Kenya to address health issues and activities of the nurses in the then Kenya Colony.\n\nIn 1983, the Council was finally acknowledged by an Act of Parliament under the Nurses Act Cap 257 of the Laws of Kenya as the \"Nursing Council of Kenya\".\n\nThe core functions of the Nursing Council of Kenya are to establish and improve standards of all branches of the nursing profession in all their aspects and to safeguard the interest of all nurses. The Council establishes and continues to improve the standards of professional nursing and of health care within the community. With the approval of the Minister, the Council:\n\n\nNurses in Kenya fall into two main categories:\n\n\nKenya Registered Accident and Emergency Nurse\nKenya Registered Palliative Care Nursing\n\n"}
{"id": "3426093", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=3426093", "title": "Nutrition facts label", "text": "Nutrition facts label\n\nThe nutrition facts label (also known as the nutrition information panel, and other slight variations) is a label required on most packaged food in many countries. Most countries also release overall nutrition guides for general educational purposes. In some cases, the guides are based on different dietary targets for various nutrients than the labels on specific foods.\n\nNutrition facts labels are only one of many types of food label required by regulation or applied by manufacturers.\n\nAustralia and New Zealand use a nutritional information panel of the following format:\n\nOther items are included as appropriate, and the units may be varied as appropriate (e.g. substituting ml for g, or mmol for mg in the 'Sodium' row). In April 2013 the New Zealand government introduced rules around common claims made on food packaging, such as 'low in fat'.\n\nIn Canada, a standardized \"Nutrition Facts\" label was introduced as part of regulations passed in 2003, and became mandatory for most prepackaged food products on December 12, 2005. (Smaller businesses were given until December 12, 2007 to make the information available.). In accordance with food packaging laws in the country, all information, including the nutrition label, must be written in both English and French, the country's two official languages.\n\nCanadian regulation tightly controls the manner in which the nutrition fact table (NFT) data are laid out. There is a wide variety of possible formats for use on a given food package. A selection hierarchy is used to select among the many formats (28 main formats, and 2-7 sub formats for each). This results in standard (vertical) formats being considered for use before horizontal and linear formats. The selection hierarchy also allows the NFT to occupy no more than 15% of the physical package's available display area (ADS), but never to be smaller than a format that would be <=15% of ADS. In practice, determining the ADS of a package, and selecting the appropriate NFT format, can be a detailed calculation.\n\nIn 2011 the Chinese Ministry of Health released the National Food Safety Standard for Nutrition Labeling of Prepackaged Foods (GB 28050-2011). The core nutrients that must be on a label are: protein, fat, carbohydrate and sodium. Energy is noted in kJ. And all values must be per 100g/100ml.,\n\nIt was regulated by the Commission Directive 2008/100/EC of 28 October 2008 amending Council Directive 90/496/EEC on nutrition labelling for foodstuffs as regards recommended daily allowances, energy conversion factors and definitions. A new regulation is now in force (Regulation 1169/2011). Nutritional labelling becomes mandatory for most pre-packaged foods as from December 2016.\n\nIn the European Union, along the \"old\" rules (Directive 90/496, amended), the information (usually in panel format) is most often labelled \"Nutrition Information\" (or equivalent in other EU languages). An example is shown on the right. The panel is optional, but if provided, the prescribed content and format must be followed. It will always give values for a set quantity¬†‚Äî or of the product¬†‚Äî and often also for a defined \"serving\", as an option. First will come the energy values, in both kilocalories and kilojoules.\n\nThen will come a breakdown of constituent elements: usually most or all of protein, carbohydrate, starch, sugar, fat, fibre and sodium. The \"fat\" figure is likely to be further broken down into saturated and unsaturated fat, while the \"carbohydrate\" figure is likely to give a subtotal for sugars. With the \"new\" rules, the mandatory information is: energy, fat, saturates, carbohydrates, sugars, protein and salt, in that particular order, with options to extend this list to: mono-unsaturates, polyunsaturates, polyols, starch, fibre, and vitamins and minerals.\n\nWith regards to health claims and nutrition (composition) claims, these are harmonised in the EU through Regulation 1924/2006, amended. In November 2012, the European Commission published two new regulations: Regulation (EC) No. 1047/2012 and Regulation (EC) No.1048/2012.\nCertain nutrition claim groups as of Regulation (EC) No 1924/2006 had to be changed. Moreover, the health claims associated to barley beta-gluten were amended (e.g. lowering blood cholesterol).\n\nWithin Regulation 1924, there are legal definitions of terms such as \"low fat\", \"high fibre\", \"reduced calories\".\n\nAll health claims have been harmonised in the European Union. They can be used if they have been approved by EFSA. The list of approved and rejected claims is available on a web site.\n\nProvided the full nutrition information is shown on the packet, additional nutritional information and formats (e.g. a traffic light rating system) may be included and this falls outside the scope of regulation.\n\nThe United Kingdom regulations are given in Schedules 6 and 7 of the Food Labelling Regulations 1996.\n\nIn Hong Kong nutrition facts labels are regulated by the subsidiary legislation Food and Drugs (Composition and Labelling) (Amendment: Requirements for Nutrition Labelling and Nutrition Claim) Regulation 2008.\n\nThe Ministry of Health and Family Welfare had, on September 19, 2008, notified the Prevention of Food Adulteration (5th Amendment) Rules, 2008, mandating packaged food manufacturers to declare on their product labels nutritional information and a mark from the F.P.O or Agmark (Companies that are responsible for checking food products) to enable consumers make informed choices while purchasing. Prior to this amendment, disclosure of nutritional information was largely voluntary though many large manufacturers tend to adopt the international practice.\n\nFood products sold in Mexico use the NOM-051-SCFI-1994 \"Informaci√≥n nutrimental\" product labelling standard, very similar to \"Nutrition Facts\" in the US. The Official Mexican Standard, or NOM (\"Norma Oficial Mexicana\"), was developed by the Mexican Secretary of Commerce and Industrial Promotion (\"Secretar√≠a de Comercio y Fomento Industrial\"), now a part of the Secretary of the Economy (SECOFI). It entered into effect on January 24, 1996 and defines \"General specifications for labelling foods and pre-bottled non-alcoholic beverages.\"\n\nIn the United States, the Nutritional Facts label lists the percentage supplied that is recommended to be met, or to be limited, in one day of human nutrients based on a daily diet of 2,000 calories.\n\nWith certain exceptions, such as foods meant for babies, the following Daily Values are used. These are called Reference Daily Intake (RDI) values and were originally based on the highest 1968 Recommended Dietary Allowances (RDA) for each nutrient in order to assure that the needs of all age and sex combinations were met. These are older than the current Recommended Dietary Allowances of the Dietary Reference Intake. For vitamin C, vitamin D, vitamin E, vitamin K, calcium, phosphorus, magnesium, and manganese, the current highest RDAs are up to 50% higher than the older Daily Values used in labeling, whereas for other nutrients the recommended needs have gone down. A side-by-side table of the old and new adult Daily Values is provided at Reference Daily Intake. As of October 2010, the only micronutrients that are required to be included on all labels are vitamin A, vitamin C, calcium, and iron. To determine the nutrient levels in the foods, companies may develop or use databases, and these may be submitted voluntarily to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for review.\n\nAdditionally, there is a requirement for ingredients to be listed in order from highest to lowest quantity, according to their weight.\nThe label was mandated for most food products under the provisions of the 1990 Nutrition Labeling and Education Act (NLEA), per the recommendations of the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. It was one of several controversial actions taken during the tenure of FDA Commissioner Dr. David Kessler. The law required food companies to begin using the new food label on packaged foods beginning May 8, 1994. (Meat and poultry products were not covered by NLEA, though the U.S. Department of Agriculture proposed similar regulations for voluntary labeling of raw meat and poultry.) Foods labeled before that day could use the old label. This appeared on all products in 1995. The old label was titled \"Nutrition Information Per Serving\" or simply, \"Nutrition Information\".\n\nThe label begins with a standard serving measurement, calories are listed second, and then following is a breakdown of the constituent elements. Always listed are total fat, sodium, carbohydrates and protein; the other nutrients usually shown may be suppressed, if they are zero. Usually all 15 nutrients are shown: calories, calories from fat, fat, saturated fat, trans fat, cholesterol, sodium, carbohydrates, dietary fiber, sugars, protein, vitamin A, vitamin C, calcium, and iron.\n\nProducts containing less than 5¬†g of fat show amounts rounded to the nearest 0.5¬†g. Amounts less than 0.5¬†g are rounded to 0¬†g. For example, if a product contains 0.45¬†g of trans fat per serving, and the package contains 18 servings, the label would show 0¬†g of trans fat, even though the product actually contains a total of 8.1¬†g of trans fat.\n\nIn addition to the nutrition label, products may display certain nutrition information or health claims on packaging. These health claims are only allowed by the FDA for \"eight diet and health relationships based on proven scientific evidence\", including: calcium and osteoporosis, fiber-containing grain products, fruits and vegetables and cancer, fruits, vegetables, and grain products that contain fiber‚Äîparticularly soluble fiber‚Äîand the risk of coronary heart disease, fat and cancer, saturated fat and cholesterol and coronary heart disease, sodium and hypertension, and folate and neural tube defects. The Institute of Medicine recommended these labels contain the most useful nutritional information for consumers: saturated fats, trans fats, sodium, calories, and serving size. In January 2011, food manufacturers and grocery stores announced plans to display some of this nutrition information on processed food.\n\nThe nutrition facts label currently appears on more than 6.5 billion food packages. President Bill Clinton issued an award of design excellence for the nutrition facts label in 1997 to Burkey Belser in Washington, DC.\n\nThe FDA does not require any specific typeface be used in the Nutrition Facts label, mandating only that the label \"utilize a single easy-to-read type style\", though its example label uses Helvetica. However, as regulated by the FDA and the USDA, it is mandatory for certain information listed in the label to be written in English, including: name of the product, net quantity, serving size and number of servings per package, nutrition facts, ingredient list, and name of manufacturer or distributor. The smallest lettering should be at least 1/16th of an inch tall (1.5875 millimeters), based on the height of a lowercase \"o\".\n\nIn January 2006, \"Trans\" fat was required to be listed under saturated fat. This was the first significant change to the Nutrition Facts panel since it was introduced in 1993.\n\nIn 2014, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration proposed several simultaneous improvements to nutrition labeling for the first time in over 20 years. The proposed changes were based on trends of consumption of nutrients of public health importance. However, studies had shown that the majority of the U.S. population could not understand the information in the then current Nutrition Facts Label. Nutrition label numeracy is particularly low in older individuals, of black and Hispanic race/ethnicity, who are unemployed, born outside of the US, have lower English proficiency, lower education achievement, lower income, or live in the South.\n\nProposed changes included a new design requiring serving sizes to more accurately reflect how many servings the average individual is actually consuming. The new recommendation also proposed removing ‚Äúcalories from fat‚Äù, and instead focusing on total calories and type of fats being consumed in a product. The proposed labels were to also list how much sugar is added (rather than inherent) to a product, as well as declaring the amount of Vitamin D and potassium in a product. Some of these changes sparked a major debate between the food industry and public health agencies. The proposal to indicate sugar added during food production, in particular, was brought forward by the FDA as a measure to counter the increase in per capita sugar consumption in the US, which over the last decades exceeded the limits recommended by scientific institutions and governmental agencies. Major American food associations opposed the label change, indicating \"lack of merit\" and \"no preponderance of evidence\" to justify the inclusion of sugar added in the new label.\n\nThe rules for the new design were finalized on May 20, 2016. Manufacturers were initially given until July 26, 2018 to comply (or July 26, 2019 if they have less than $10 million in annual food sales). A proposed rule by the FDA would extend the compliance deadline to January 1, 2020 (or January 1, 2021 for qualified small business). For food and dietary supplement labeling purposes the amounts of vitamins and nutritionally essential minerals in a serving are expressed as a percent of Daily Value (%DV).

This procedure is crucial in computer assisted surgery, in order to insure the reproducitibility of the preoperative registration and the clinical situation during surgery.\nThe use of the term \"patient registration\" out of this context can lead to a confusion with the procedure of registering a patient into the files of a medical institution.\n\nIn computer assisted surgery, the first step is to gather a 3D dataset that reproduces with great accuracy the geometry of the normal and pathological tissues in the region that has to be operated on. This is mainly obtained by using CT or MRI scans of that region. The role of patient registration is to obtain a close-to-ideal reference reproducibility of the dataset ‚Äì in order to correlate the position (offset) of the gathered dataset with the patient's position during the surgical intervention. Patient registration (1) eliminates the necessity of maintaining the same strict position of the patient during both preoperative scanning and surgery, and (2) provides the surgical robot the necessary reference information to act accurately on the patient, even if he has (been) moved during the intervention.\n\nPatient registration was used mostly in head surgery ‚Äì oral and maxillofacial surgery, neurosurgery, otolaryngology. With the advent of marker- and markerless-registration, the concept has been extended for abdominal surgery.\n\nThe first attempts in 3D mapping of human tissues were made by V. Horsley and R. Clarke in 1906. They have built a rectangular stereotactic headframe that had to be fixed to the head. It was based on cartesian principles and allowed them to accurately and reproductibly guide needle-like electrodes for neurophysiological experiments. They have experimented animals and were able to contribute to the mapping of the cerebellum. Improved versions of the Horsley‚ÄìClarke apparatus are still in used today in experimental neurosurgery.\n\nThe first stereotactic device for humans was also developed in neurosurgery, by E. Spiegel and H. Wycis in 1947. It was used for surgical treatment of Parkinson's disease and, during time, its applicability was extended for the surgical treatment of tumors, vascular malformations, functional neurosurgery etc. The system was based both on headframes and X-ray images taken for all three planes of space.\n\nFurther development of stereotactic surgery was made by Brown, Roberts and Wells in 1980. They have developed a halo ring that was applied on the skull, during a CT scan and neurosurgical interventions. This method provided improved surgical guidance and was in fact the first development of computer guided surgery.\n\nPatient registration for the head area has developed for nearly two decades on the same principle of combining CT scans with mechanical reference devices such as headframes or halo rings. But the clinical experience showed that headgear is very uncomfortable to wear and even impossible to apply on little children, because their lack of cooperation; furthermore, the headframes can create artifacts in preoperative data gathering, or during surgery.\n\nIn 1986, a different approach was developed by Roberts und Strohbehn. They have used as landmarks several markers on the patient's skin both preoperative CT registration, and intraoperatively. This was a new current of the time in patient registration. Still, the method is time-consuming, and the exact reproducitibility of the marker positions is questionable.\n\nThe bony structures can provide a much better stability and reproducibility of the landmarks for patient registration. Based on this concept, a further technique was used: to implant temporary markers into bone structures that are superficial to the skin, under local anestesia. This was also combined with surface markers and CT registration. The technique has the disadvantage of a further minimal surgical procedure of placing the bone implants, with some risk of infection for the patient.\n\nDental splints have been traditionally used for transferring and reproducing 3D reference landmarks for positioning cast models in articulators ‚Äì in dental prosthetics, orthodontics and orthognatic surgery. By applying several infrared markers on the splints and using an infrared camera, a better registration was obtained.\n\nThe first attempts, based on the identification of anatomical landmarks were made by Caversaccio and Zulliger. The method was based on identifying certain antropometrical points and other anatomical landmarks on the skull, in correlation with the CT registration. But the landmarks cannot be exactly pointed out and reproduced during patient dataset registration and surgery, therefore the method is not precise enough.\n\nSince 1998, new procedures have been developed by Marmulla and co-workers, using a different approach to the problem. Both during CT dataset gathering and surgical intervention, the patient registration was made by registering complete areas and surfaces, instead of distinctive surface markers. This was achieved by using laser scanners and a small guiding transmitter. The precision of the patient registration was significantly improved with this method.\n\nBased on this concept, several registration and navigation systems were built by the same team. The Surgical Segment Navigator (SSN and SSN++) is such a system, developed for the first time for oral and maxillofacial surgery. This system correlates three different coordinate sets: CT data set, surface laser scan data set and the dataset produced by a small guiding transmitter, placed on the patient's head. The Laboratory Unit for Computer-Assisted Surgery (LUCAS) is used for planning surgery in the laboratory. This technological and surgical advance has permitted the elimination of mechanical guidance systems and improved the accuracy of the determinations, and thus the surgical act.\n"}

Supporters of the peak farmland theory argue that even with the growing world population, the need for more farmland is decreasing, as food production yields per acre of farmland are rising faster than the global demand for food. This is supported by the fact that the area dedicated to farmland in some countries, both developed (e.g. Finland) and developing (e.g. India, China), has already begun to decline. Globally, while the total amount of arable land is still increasing, the area of permanent pasture has been in decline since 1998, with at least 60 million hectares no longer grazed. It is argued that other countries, such as the United States, are at their peak farmland now.\n\nThe concept is usually referenced to the work of Jesse Ausubel and Iddo Wernick. They predict that over the next fifty years an area of at least 146 million hectares is going to be released from farming and will probably revert to its natural state. As land conversion (from a natural state to human use) is one of the greatest threats to the natural environment in general, and biodiversity in particular, this is seen as good for the environment.\n\nGeisler and Currens note, however, that \"Peak Farmland, though newly named, is a long-standing issue\" that has been debated by scholars for decades. The issue deals with two opposing views: one that predicts that more and more farmland will be needed to sustain the growing world population, and the other (the peak farmland view) that progress in agricultural techniques, measured in steadily increasing crop yields from a set amount of farmland, will result in a decrease in the amount of farmland needed to feed the world's population, eventually leading to a decrease in the world's acreage of farmland.\n\n\n"}

The reason for the rebellion was the coercive introduction of potato cultivation. The government selected the best fertile sections for potatoes from peasant lands. Authorities enforced brutal punishments for the non-fulfillment of the orders and assessed different requisitions. In 1834 unrest flared up in Vyatsky and Vladimir provinces, but it reached its height among the state peasants in 1840‚Äì44. Riots appeared simultaneously and they were partly in response to Pavel Kiselyov's reforms of state villages (1837‚Äì41). In the provinces of Ural and the lower Volga Region more than 500,000 peasants rose up destroying sowings of potatoes, and thrashing officials. They arbitrarily re-elected wardens, and attacked punitive detachments with weapons. Aside from ethnic Russians, participants in the riots included the Mari population, Chuvashes, Udmurts, Tatars, and Komi. The government sent troops to suppress the riots. In a number of places, peasants were shot.

{"id": "126688", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=126688", "title": "Prevalence", "text": "Prevalence\n\nPrevalence in epidemiology is the proportion of a particular population found to be affected by a medical condition (typically a disease or a risk factor such as smoking or seat-belt use). It is derived by comparing the number of people found to have the condition with the total number of people studied, and is usually expressed as a fraction, as a percentage, or as the number of cases per 10,000 or 100,000 people. Point prevalence is the proportion of a population that has the condition at a specific point in time. Period prevalence is the proportion of a population that has the condition at some time during a given period (e.g., 12 month prevalence), and includes people who already have the condition at the start of the study period as well as those who acquire it during that period. Lifetime prevalence (LTP) is the proportion of a population that at some point in their life (up to the time of assessment) have experienced the condition.\n\nPrevalence estimates are used by epidemiologists, health care providers, government agencies, toxicologists, and insurers.\n\nPrevalence is contrasted with incidence, which is a measure of \"new\" cases arising in a population over a given period (month, year, etc.). The difference between prevalence and incidence can be summarized thus: prevalence answers \"How many people have this disease right now?\" or \"How many people have had this disease during this time period?\" and incidence answers \"How many people per year newly acquire this disease?\"\n\nIn science, \"prevalence\" describes a proportion (typically expressed as a percentage). For example, the prevalence of obesity among American adults in 2001 was estimated by the U. S. Centers for Disease Control (CDC) at approximately 20.9%.\n\nPrevalence is a term which means being widespread and it is distinct from incidence. Prevalence is a measurement of \"all\" individuals affected by the disease at a particular time, whereas incidence is a measurement of the number of \"new\" individuals who contract a disease during a particular period of time. Prevalence is a useful parameter when talking about long lasting diseases, such as HIV, but incidence is more useful when talking about diseases of short duration, such as chickenpox. \n\nLifetime prevalence (LTP) is the proportion of individuals in a population that at some point in their life (up to the time of assessment) have experienced a \"case\", e.g., a disease; a traumatic event; or a behavior, such as committing a crime. Often, a 12-month prevalence (or some other type of \"period prevalence\") is provided in conjunction with lifetime prevalence. \"Point prevalence\" is the prevalence of disorder at a specific point in time (a month or less). \"Lifetime morbid risk\" is \"the proportion of a population that might become afflicted with a given disease at any point in their lifetime.\"\n\nPeriod prevalence is the proportion of the population with a given disease or condition over a specific period of time. It could describe how many people in a population had a cold over the cold season in 2006, for example. It is expressed as a percentage of the population and can be described by the following formula:\n\nPeriod prevalence (ratio) = Number of cases that existed in a given period √∑ Number of people in the population during this period\n\nThe relationship between incidence (rate), point prevalence (ratio) and period prevalence (ratio) is easily explained via an analogy with photography. Point prevalence is akin to a flashlit photograph: what is happening at this instant frozen in time. Period prevalence is analogous to a long exposure (seconds, rather than an instant) photograph: the number of events recorded in the photo whilst the camera shutter was open. In a movie each frame records an instant (point prevalence); by looking from frame to frame one notices new events (incident events) and can relate the number of such events to a period (number of frames); see incidence rate.\n\nPoint prevalence is a measure of the proportion of people in a population who have a disease or condition at a particular time, such as a particular date. It is like a snap shot of the disease in time. It can be used for statistics on the occurrence of chronic diseases. This is in contrast to period prevalence which is a measure of the proportion of people in a population who have a disease or condition over a specific period of time, say a season, or a year. Point prevalence can be described by the formula: Prevalence = Number of existing cases on a specific date √∑ Number of people in the population on this date \n\nIt can be said that a very small error applied over a very large number of individuals (that is, those who are \"not affected\" by the condition in the general population during their lifetime; for example, over 95%) produces a relevant, non-negligible number of subjects who are incorrectly classified as having the condition or any other condition which is the object of a survey study: these subjects are the so-called false positives; such reasoning applies to the 'false positive' but not the 'false negative' problem where we have an error applied over a relatively very small number of individuals to begin with (that is, those who are \"affected\" by the condition in the general population; for example, less than 5%). Hence, a very high percentage of subjects who seem to have a history of a disorder at interview are false positives for such a medical condition and apparently never suffered a fully clinical syndrome.\n\nA different but related problem in evaluating the public health significance of psychiatric conditions has been highlighted by Robert Spitzer of Columbia University: fulfillment of diagnostic criteria and the resulting diagnosis do not necessarily imply need for treatment.\n\nA well-known statistical problem arises when ascertaining rates for disorders and conditions with a relatively low population prevalence or base rate. Even assuming that lay interview diagnoses are highly accurate in terms of sensitivity and specificity and their corresponding area under the ROC curve (that is, AUC, or area under the receiver operating characteristic curve), a condition with a relatively low prevalence or base-rate is bound to yield high false positive rates, which exceed false negative rates; in such a circumstance a limited positive predictive value, PPV, yields high false positive rates even in presence of a specificity which is very close to 100%.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "216104", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=216104", "title": "Protein engineering", "text": "Protein engineering\n\nProtein engineering is the process of developing useful or valuable proteins. It is a young discipline, with much research taking place into the understanding of protein folding and recognition for protein design principles. It is also a product and services market, with an estimated value of $168 billion by 2017.\n\nThere are two general strategies for protein engineering: rational protein design and directed evolution. These methods are not mutually exclusive; researchers will often apply both. In the future, more detailed knowledge of protein structure and function, and advances in high-throughput screening, may greatly expand the abilities of protein engineering. Eventually, even unnatural amino acids may be included, via newer methods, such as expanded genetic code, that allow encoding novel amino acids in genetic code.\n\nIn rational protein design, a scientist uses detailed knowledge of the structure and function of a protein to make desired changes. In general, this has the advantage of being inexpensive and technically easy, since site-directed mutagenesis methods are well-developed. However, its major drawback is that detailed structural knowledge of a protein is often unavailable, and, even when available, it can be very difficult to predict the effects of various mutations since structural information most often provide a static picture of a protein structure. However, programs such as Folding@home and Foldit have utilized crowdsourcing techniques in order to gain insight into the folding motifs of proteins. \nComputational protein design algorithms seek to identify novel amino acid sequences that are low in energy when folded to the pre-specified target structure. While the sequence-conformation space that needs to be searched is large, the most challenging requirement for computational protein design is a fast, yet accurate, energy function that can distinguish optimal sequences from similar suboptimal ones.\n\nWithout structural information about a protein, sequence analysis is often useful in elucidating information about the protein. These techniques involve alignment of target protein sequences with other related protein sequences. This alignment can show which amino acids are conserved between species and are important for the function of the protein. These analyses can help to identify hot spot amino acids that can serve as the target sites for mutations. Multiple sequence alignment utilizes data bases such as PREFAB, SABMARK, OXBENCH, IRMBASE, and BALIBASE in order to cross reference target protein sequences with known sequences. Multiple sequence alignment techniques are listed below.\n\nThis method begins by performing pair wise alignment of sequences using k-tuple or Needleman‚ÄìWunsch methods. These methods calculate a matrix that depicts the pair wise similarity among the sequence pairs. Similarity scores are then transformed into distance scores that are used to produce a guide tree using the neighbor joining method. This guide tree is then employed to yield a multiple sequence alignment.\n\nThis method is capable of aligning up to 190,00 sequences by utilizing the k-tuple method. Next sequences are clustered using the mBed and \"k\"-means methods. A guide tree is then constructed using the UPGMA method that is used by the HH align package. This guide tree is used to generate multiple sequence alignments.\n\nThis method utilizes Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) that converts amino acid sequences into a sequence composed of volume and polarity values for each amino acid residue. This new sequence is used to find homologous regions.\n\nThis method utilizes the Wu-Manber approximate string matching algorithm to generate multiple sequence alignments.\n\nThis method utilizes Kmer and Kimura distances to generate multiple sequence alignments.\n\nThis method utilizes tree based consistency objective functions for alignment evolution. This method has been shown to be 5-10% more accurate than Clustal W.\n\nCoevolutionary analysis is also known as correlated mutation, covariation, or co-substitution. This type of rational design involves reciprocal evolutionary changes at evolutionarily interacting loci. Generally this method begins with the generation of a curated multiple sequence alignments for the target sequence. This alignment is then subjected to manual refinement that involves removal of highly gapped sequences also sequences with low sequence identity. This step increases the quality of the alignment. Next, the manually processed alignment is utilized for further coevolutionary measurements using distinct correlated mutation algorithms. These algorithms result in a coevolution scoring matrix. This matrix is filtered by applying various significance tests to extract significant coevolution values and wipe out background noise. Coevolutionary measurements are further evaluated to assess their performance and stringency. Finally, the results from this coevolutionary analysis are validated experimentally.\n\n\"De Novo\" synthesis of protein benefits from knowledge of existing protein structures. This knowledge of existing protein structure assists with the prediction of new protein structures. Methods for protein structure prediction fall under one of the four following classes: \"ab initio,\" fragment based methods, homology modeling, and protein threading.\n\nThese methods involve free modeling without using any structural information about the template. \"Ab initio\" methods are aimed at prediction of the native structures of proteins corresponding to the global minimum of its free energy. some examples of \"ab initio\" methods are AMBER, GROMOS, GROMACS, CHARMM, OPLS, and ENCEPP12. General steps for \"ab initio\" methods begin with the geometric representation of the protein of interest. Next, a potential energy function model for the protein is developed. This model can be created using either molecular mechanics potentials or protein structure derived potential functions. Following the development of a potential model, energy search techniques including molecular dynamic simulations, Monte Carlo simulations and genetic algorithms are applied to the protein.\n\nThese methods use database information regarding structures to match homologous structures to the created protein sequences. These homologous structures are assembled to give compact structures using scoring and optimization procedures, with the goal of achieving the lowest potential energy score. Webservers for fragment information are listed here: I-TASSER, ROSETTA, ROSETTA @ home, FRAGFOLD, CABS fold, PROFESY, CREF, QUARK, UNDERTAKER, HMM, and ANGLOR.\n\nThese methods are based upon the homology of proteins. These methods are also known as comparative modeling. The first step in homology modeling is generally the identification of template sequences of known structure which are homologous to the query sequence. Next the query sequence is aligned to the template sequence. Following the alignment, the structurally conserved regions are modeled using the template structure. This is followed by the modeling of side chains and loops that are distinct from the template. Finally the modeled structure undergoes refirnment and assessment of quality. Servers that are available for homology modeling data are listed here: SWISS MODEL, MODELLER, ReformAlign, PyMOD, TIP-STRUCTFAST, COMPASS, 3d-PSSM, SAMT02, SAMT99, HHPRED, FAGUE, 3D-JIGSAW, META-PP, ROSETTA, and I-TASSER.\n\nProtein threading can be used when a reliable homologue for the query sequence cannot be found. This method begins by obtaining a query sequence and a library of template structures. Next, the query sequence is threaded over known template structures. These candidate models are scored using scoring functions. These are scored based upon potential energy models of both query and template sequence. The match with the lowest potential energy model is then selected. Methods and servers for retrieving threading data and performing calculations are listed here: GenTHREADER, pGenTHREADER, pDomTHREADER, ORFEUS, PROSPECT, BioShell-Threading, FFASO3, RaptorX, HHPred, LOOPP server, Sparks-X, SEGMER, THREADER2, ESYPRED3D, LIBRA, TOPITS, RAPTOR, COTH, MUSTER.\n\nFor more information on rational design see Site-directed mutagenesis.\n\nIn directed evolution, random mutagenesis, e.g. by error-prone PCR or Sequence Saturation Mutagenesis, is applied to a protein, and a selection regime is used to select variants having desired traits. Further rounds of mutation and selection are then applied. This method mimics natural evolution and, in general, produces superior results to rational design. An added process, termed DNA shuffling, mixes and matches pieces of successful variants to produce better results. Such processes mimic the recombination that occurs naturally during sexual reproduction. Advantages of directed evolution are that it requires no prior structural knowledge of a protein, nor is it necessary to be able to predict what effect a given mutation will have. Indeed, the results of directed evolution experiments are often surprising in that desired changes are often caused by mutations that were not expected to have some effect. The drawback is that they require high-throughput screening, which is not feasible for all proteins. Large amounts of recombinant DNA must be mutated and the products screened for desired traits. The large number of variants often requires expensive robotic equipment to automate the process. Further, not all desired activities can be screened for easily.\n\nNatural Darwinian evolution can be effectively imitated in the lab toward tailoring protein properties for diverse applications, including catalysis. Many experimental technologies exist to produce large and diverse protein libraries and for screening or selecting folded, functional variants. Folded proteins arise surprisingly frequently in random sequence space, an occurrence exploitable in evolving selective binders and catalysts. While more conservative than direct selection from deep sequence space, redesign of existing proteins by random mutagenesis and selection/screening is a particularly robust method for optimizing or altering extant properties. It also represents an excellent starting point for achieving more ambitious engineering goals. Allying experimental evolution with modern computational methods is likely the broadest, most fruitful strategy for generating functional macromolecules unknown to nature.\n\nThe main challenges of designing high quality mutant libraries have shown significant progress in the recent past. This progress has been in the form of better descriptions of the effects of mutational loads on protein traits. Also computational approaches have showed large advances in the innumerably large sequence space to more manageable screenable sizes, thus creating smart libraries of mutants. Library size has also been reduced to more screenable sizes by the identification of key beneficial residues using algorithms for systematic recombination. Finally a significant step forward toward efficient reengineering of enzymes has been made with the development of more accurate statistical models and algorithms quantifying and predicting coupled mutational effects on protein functions.\n\nGenerally, directed evolution may be summarized as an iterative two step process which involves generation of protein mutant libraries, and high throughput screening processes to select for variants with improved traits. This technique does not require prior knowledge of the protein structure and function relationship. Directed evolution utilizes random or focused mutagenesis to generate libraries of mutant proteins. Random mutations can be introduced using either error prone PCR, or site saturation mutagenesis. Mutants may also be generated using recombination of multiple homologous genes. Nature has evolved a limited number of beneficial sequences. Directed evolution makes it possible to identify undiscovered protein sequences which have novel functions. This ability is contingent on the proteins ability to tolerant amino acid residue substitutions without compromising folding or stability.\n\nDirected evolution methods can be broadly categorized into two strategies, asexual and sexual methods.\n\nAsexual methods do not generate any cross links between parental genes. Single genes are used to create mutant libraries using various mutagenic techniques. These asexual methods can produce either random or focused mutagenesis.\n\nRandom mutagenic methods produce mutations at random throughout the gene of interest. Random mutagenesis can introduce the following types of mutations: transitions, transversions, insertions, deletions, inversion, missense, and nonsense. Examples of methods for producing random mutagenesis are below.\n\nError prone PCR utilizes the fact that Taq DNA polymerase lacks 3' to 5' exonuclease activity. This results in an error rate of 0.001-0.002% per nucleotide per replication. This method begins with choosing the gene, or the area within a gene, one wishes to mutate. Next, the extent of error required is calculated based upon the type and extent of activity one wishes to generate. This extent of error determines the error prone PCR strategy to be employed. Following PCR, the genes are cloned into a plasmid and introduced to competent cell systems. These cells are then screened for desired traits. Plasmids are then isolated for colonies which show improved traits, and are then used as templates the next round of mutagenesis. Error prone PCR shows biases for certain mutations relative to others. Such as biases for transitions over transversions.\n\nRates of error in PCR can be increased in the following ways:\nAlso see Polymerase chain reaction for more information.\n\nThis PCR method is based upon rolling circle amplification, which is modeled from the method that bacteria use to amplify circular DNA. This method results in linear DNA duplexes. These fragments contain tandem repeats of circular DNA called concatamers, which can be transformed into bacterial strains. Mutations are introduced by first cloning the target sequence into an appropriate plasmid. Next, the amplification process begins using random hexamer primers and Œ¶29 DNA polymerase under error prone rolling circle amplification conditions. Additional conditions to produce error prone rolling circle amplification are 1.5 pM of template DNA, 1.5 mM MnCl and a 24 hour reaction time. MnCl is added into the reaction mixture to promote random point mutations in the DNA strands. Mutation rates can be increased by increasing the concentration of MnCl, or by decreasing concentration of the template DNA. Error prone rolling circle amplification is advantageous relative to error prone PCR because of its use of universal random hexamer primers, rather than specific primers. Also the reaction products of this amplification do not need to be treated with ligases or endonucleases. This reaction is isothermal.\n\nChemical mutagenesis involves the use of chemical agents to introduce mutations into genetic sequences. Examples of chemical mutagens follow:\n\nSodium Bisulfate - This mutagenic agent is effective at mutating G/C rich genomic sequences. This is because sodium bisulfate catalyses deamination of unmethylated cytosine to uracil.\n\nEthyl Methane Sulfonate - This chemical agent alkylates guanidine residues. This alteration causes errors during DNA replication.\n\nNitrous Acid - This chemical agent causes transversion by de-amination of adenine and cytosine.\n\nThe dual approach to random chemical mutagenesis is an iterative two step process. First it involves the \"in vivo\" chemical mutagenesis of the gene of interest via EMS. Next, the treated gene is isolated and cloning into an untreated expression vector in order to prevent mutations in the plasmid backbone. This technique preserves the plasmids genetic properties.\n\nThis method has been used to create targeted \"in vivo\" mutagenesis in yeast. This method involves the fusion of a 3-methyladenine DNA glycosylase to tetR DNA-binding domain. This has been shown to increase mutation rates by over 800 time in regions of the genome containing tetO sites.\n\nThis method involves alteration in length of the sequence via simultaneous deletion and insertion of chunks of bases of arbitrary length. This method has been shown to produce proteins with new functionalities via introduction of new restriction sites, specific codons, four base codons for non-natural amino acids.\n\nRecently many methods for transposon based random mutagenesis have been reported. This methods include, but are not limited to the following: PERMUTE-Random Circular Permutation, random protein truncation, random nucleotide triplet substitution, random domain/tag/multiple amino acid insertion, codon scanning mutagenesis, and multicodon scanning mutagenesis. These aforementioned techniques all require the design of mini-Mu transposons. Thermo scientific manufactures kits for the design of these transposons.\n\nThese methods involve altering gene length via insertion and deletion mutations. An example is the Tandem Repeat Inserstion (TRINS) method. This technique results in the generation of tandem repeats of random fragments of the target gene via rolling circle amplification and concurrent incorporation of these repeats into the target gene.\n\nMutator strains are bacterial cell lines which are deficient in one or more DNA repair mechanisms. An example of a mutator strand is the E. coli XL1-RED. This subordinate strain of E. coli is deficient in the MutS, MutD, MutT DNA repair pathways. Use of mutator strains is useful at introducing many types of mutation; however, these strains show progressive sickness of culture because of the accumulation of mutations in the strains own genome.\n\nFocused mutagenic methods produce mutations at predetermined amino acid residues. These techniques require and understanding of the sequence-function relationship for the protein of interest. Understanding of this relationship allows for the identification of residues which are important in stability, stereoselectivity, and catalytic efficiency. Examples of methods that produce focused mutagenesis are below.\n\nSite saturation mutagenesis is a PCR based method used to target amino acids with significant roles in protein function. The two most common techniques for performing this are whole plasmid single PCR, and overlap extension PCR.\n\nWhole plasmid single PCR is also referred to as site directed mutagenesis (SDM). SDM products are subjected to Dpn endonuclease digestion. This digestion results in cleavage of only the parental strand, because the parental strand contains a GmATC which is methylated at N6 of adenine. SDM does not work well for large plasmids of over ten kilobases. Also, this method is only capable of replacing two nucleotides at a time.\n\nOverlap extension PCR requires the use of two pairs of primers. One primer in each set contains a mutation. A first round of PCR using these primer sets is performed and two double stranded DNA duplexes are formed. A second round of PCR is then performed in which these duplexes are denatured and annealed with the primer sets again to produce heteroduplexes, in which each strand has a mutation. Any gaps in these newly formed heteroduplexes are filled with DNA polymerases and further amplified.\n\nThis technique results in the randomization of the target sequence at every nucleotide position. This method begins with the generation of variable length DNA fragments tailed with universal bases via the use of template transferases at the 3' termini. Next, these fragments are extended to full length using a single stranded template. The universal bases are replaced with a random standard base, causing mutations. There are several modified versions of this method such as SeSAM-Tv-II, SeSAM-Tv+, and SeSAM-III.\n\nThis site saturation mutagenesis method involves two separate PCR reaction. The first of which uses only forward primers, while the second reaction uses only reverse primers. This avoids the formation of primer dimer formation.\n\nThis site saturation mutagenic technique begins with one mutagenic oligonucleotide and one universal flanking primer. These two reactants are used for an initial PCR cycle. Products from this first PCR cycle are used as mega primers for the next PCR.\n\nThis site saturation mutagenic method is based on overlap extension PCR. It is used to introduce mutations at any site in a circular plasmid.\n\nThis method utilizes user defined site directed mutagenesis at single or multiple sites simultaneously. OSCARR is an acronym for One Pot Simple Methodology for Cassette Randomization and Recombination. This randomization and recombination results in randomization of desired fragments of a protein. Omnichange is a sequence independent, multisite saturation mutagenesis which can saturate up to five independent codons on a gene.\n\nThis method removes redundant codons and stop codons.\n\nThis is a PCR based method. Cassette mutagenesis begins with the synthesis of a DNA cassette containing the gene of interest, which is flanked on either side by restriction sites. The endonuclease which cleaves these restriction sites also cleaves sites in the target plasmid. The DNA cassette and the target plasmid are both treated with endonucleases to cleave these restriction sites and create sticky ends. Next the products from this cleavage are ligated together, resulting in the insertion of the gene into the target plasmid. An alternative form of cassette mutagenesis called combinatorial cassette mutagenesis is used to identify the functions of individual amino acid residues in the protein of interest. Recursive ensemble mutagenesis then utilizes information from previous combinatorial cassette mutagenesis. Codon cassette mutagenesis allows you to insert or replace a single codon at a particular site in double stranded DNA.\n\nSexual methods of directed evolution involve \"in vitro\" recombination which mimic natural \"in vivo\" recombination. Generally these techniques require high sequence homology between parental sequences. These techniques are often used to recombine two different parental genes, and these methods do create cross overs between these genes.\n\nHomologous recombination can be categorized as either \"in vivo\" or \"in vitro. In vitro\" homologous recombination mimics natural \"in vivo\" recombination. These \"in vitro\" recombination methods require high sequence homology between parental sequences. These techniques exploit the natural diversity in parental genes by recombining them to yield chimeric genes. The resulting chimera show a blend of parental characteristics.\n\nThis \"in vitro\" technique was one of the first techniques in the era of recombination. It begins with the digestion of homologous parental genes into small fragments by DNase1. These small fragments are then purified from undigested parental genes. Purified fragments are then reassembled using primer-less PCR. This PCR involves homologous fragments from different parental genes priming for each other, resulting in chimeric DNA. The chimeric DNA of parental size is then amplified using end terminal primers in regular PCR.\n\nThis \"in vitro\" homologous recombination method begins with the synthesis of many short gene fragments exhibiting point mutations using random sequence primers. These fragments are reassembled to full length parental genes using primer-less PCR. These reassembled sequences are then amplified using PCR and subjected to further selection processes. This method is advantageous relative to DNA shuffling because there is no use of DNase1, thus there is no bias for recombination next to a pyrimidine nucleotide. This method is also advantageous due to its use of synthetic random primers which are uniform in length, and lack biases. Finally this method is independent of the length of DNA template sequence, and requires a small amount of parental DNA.\n\nThis method generates chimeric genes directly from metagenomic samples. It begins with isolation of the desired gene by functional screening from metagenomic DNA sample. Next, specific primers are designed and used to amplify the homologous genes from different environmental samples. Finally, chimeric libraries are generated to retrieve the desired functional clones by shuffling these amplified homologous genes.\n\nThis \"in vitro\" method is based on template switching to generate chimeric genes. This PCR based method begins with an initial denaturation of the template, followed by annealing of primers and a short extension time. All subsequent cycle generate annealing between the short fragments generated in previous cycles and different parts of the template. These short fragments and the templates anneal together based on sequence complementarity. This process of fragments annealing template DNA is known as template switching. These annealed fragments will then serve as primers for further extension. This method is carried out until the parental length chimeric gene sequence is obtained. Execution of this method only requires flanking primers to begin. There is also no need for Dnase1 enzyme.\n\nThis method has been shown to generate chimeric gene libraries with an average of 14 crossovers per chimeric gene. It begins by aligning fragments from a parental top strand onto the bottom strand of a uracil containing template from a homologous gene. 5' and 3' overhang flaps are cleaved and gaps are filled by the exonuclease and endonuclease activities of Pfu and taq DNA polymerases. The uracil containing template is then removed from the heteroduplex by treatment with a uracil DNA glcosylase, followed by further amplification using PCR. This method is advantageous because it generates chimeras with relatively high crossover frequency. However it is somewhat limited due to the complexity and the need for generation of single stranded DNA and uracil containing single stranded template DNA.\n\nShuffling of synthetic degenerate oligonucleotides adds flexibility to shuffling methods, since oligonucleotides containing optimal codons and beneficial mutations can be included.\n\nThis method involves PCR dependent reassembly of fragmented expression vectors. These reassembled vectors are then introduced to, and cloned in yeast. Using yeast to clone the vector avoids toxicity and counter-selection that would be introduced by ligation and propagation in E. coli.\n\nThis method introduces mutations into specific regions of genes while leaving other parts intact by utilizing the high frequency of homologous recombination in yeast.\n\nThis method utilizes a bacteriophage with a modified life cycle to transfer evolving genes from host to host. The phage's life cycle is designed in such a way that the transfer is correlated with the activity of interest from the enzyme. This method is advantageous because it requires minimal human intervention for the continuous evolution of the gene.\n\nThese methods are based upon the fact that proteins can exhibit similar structural identity while lacking sequence homology.\n\nExon shuffling is the combination of exons from different proteins by recombination events occurring at introns. Orthologous exon shuffling involves combining exons from orthologous genes from different species. Orthologous domain shuffling involves shuffling of entire protein domains from orthologous genes from different species. Paralogous exon shuffling involves shuffling of exon from different genes from the same species. Paralogous domain shuffling involves shuffling of entire protein domains from paralogous proteins from the same species. Functional homolog shuffling involves shuffling of non-homologous domains which are functional related. All of these processes being with amplification of the desired exons from different genes using chimeric synthetic oligonucleotides. This amplification products are then reassembled into full length genes using primer-less PCR. During these PCR cycles the fragments act as templates and primers. This results in chimeric full length genes, which are then subjected to screening.\n\nFragments of parental genes are created using controlled digestion by exonuclease III. These fragments are blunted using endonuclease, and are ligated to produce hybrid genes. THIOITHCY is a modified ITHCY technique which utilized nucleotide triphosphate analogs such as Œ±-phosphothioate dNTPs. Incorporation of these nucleotides blocks digestion by exonuclease III. This inhibition of digestion by exonuclease III is called spiking. Spiking can be accomplished by first truncating genes with exonuclease to create fragments with short single stranded overhangs. These fragments then serve as templates for amplification by DNA polymerase in the presence of small amounts of phosphothioate dNTPs. These resulting fragments are then ligated together to form full length genes. Alternatively the intact parental genes can be amplified by PCR in the presence of normal dNTPs and phosphothioate dNTPs. These full length amplification products are then subjected to digestion by an exonuclease. Digestion will continue until the exonuclease encounters an Œ±-pdNTP, resulting in fragments of different length. These fragments are then ligated together to generate chimeric genes.\n\nThis method generates libraries of hybrid genes inhibiting multiple crossovers by combining DNA shuffling and ITHCY. This method begins with the construction of two independent ITCHY libraries. The first with gene A on the N-terminus. And the other having gene B on the N-terminus. These hybrid gene fragments are separated using either restriction enzyme digestion or PCR with terminus primers via agarose gel electrophoresis. These isolated fragments are then mixed together and further digested using DNase1. Digested fragments are then reassembled by primerless PCR with template switching.\n\nThis method generates libraries of hybrid genes by template switching of uni-directionally growing polynucleotides in the presence of single stranded DNA fragments as templates for chimeras. This method begins with the preparation of single stranded DNA fragments by reverse transcription from target mRNA. Gene specific primers are then annealed to the single stranded DNA. These genes are then extended during a PCR cycle. This cycle is followed by template switching and annealing of the short fragments obtained from the earlier primer extension to other single stranded DNA fragments. This process is repeated until full length single stranded DNA is obtained.\n\nThis method generates recombination between genes with little to no sequence homology. These chimeras are fused via a linker sequence containing several restriction sites. This construct is then digested using DNase1. Fragments are made are made blunt ended using S1 nuclease. These blunt end fragments are put together into a circular sequence by ligation. This circular construct is then linearized using restriction enzymes for which the restriction sites are present in the linker region. This results in a library of chimeric genes in which contribution of genes to 5' and 3' end will be reversed as compared to the starting construct.\n\nThis method results in a library of genes with multiple crossovers from several parental genes. This method does not require sequence identity among the parental genes. This does require one or two conserved amino acids at every crossover position. It begins with alignment of parental sequences and identification of consensus regions which serve as crossover sites. This is followed by the incorporation of specific tags containing restriction sites followed by the removal of the tags by digestion with Bac1, resulting in genes with cohesive ends. These gene fragments are mixed and ligated in an appropriate order to form chimeric libraries.\n\nThis method begins with alignment of homologous genes, followed by identification of regions of polymorphism. Next the top strand of the gene is divided into small degenerate oligonucleotides. The bottom strand is also digested into oligonucleotides to serve as scaffolds. These fragments are combined in solution are top strand oligonucleotides are assembled onto bottom strand oligonucleotides. Gaps between these fragments are filled with polymerase and ligated.\n\nThis method involves the shuffling of plural DNA fragments without homology, in a single PCR. This results in the reconstruction of complete proteins by assembly of modules encoding different structural units.\n\nThis method begins with the amplification of gene fragments which need to be recombined, using uracil dNTPs. This amplification solution also contains primers, PfuTurbo, and Cx Hotstart DNA polymerase. Amplified products are next incubated with USER enzyme. This enzyme catalyzes the removal of uracil residues from DNA creating single base pair gaps. The USER enzyme treated fragments are mixed and ligated using T4 DNA ligase and subjected to Dpn1 digestion to remove the template DNA. These resulting dingle stranded fragments are subjected to amplification using PCR, and are transformed into E. coli.\n\nThis method allows you to recombine at least 9 different fragments in an acceptor vector by using type 2 restriction enzyme which cuts outside of the restriction sites. It begins with sub cloning of fragments in separate vectors to create Bsa1 flanking sequences on both sides. These vectors are then cleaved using type II restriction enzyme Bsa1, which generates four nucleotide single strand overhangs. Fragments with complementary overhangs are hybridized and ligated using T4 DNA ligase. Finally these constructs are then transformed into E. coli cells, which are screened for expression levels.\n\nThis method can be used to recombine structural elements or entire protein domains. This method is based on phosphorothioate chemistry which allows the specific cleavage of phosphorothiodiester bonds. The first step in the process begins with amplification of fragments that need to be recombined along with the vector backbone. This amplification is accomplished using primers with phosphorothiolated nucleotides at 5' ends. Amplified PCR products are cleaved in an ethanol-iodine solution at high temperatures. Next these fragments are hybridized at room temperature and transformed into E. coli which repair any nicks.\n\nThis system is based upon a natural site specific recombination system in E. coli. This system is called the integron system, and produces natural gene shuffling. This method was used to construct and optimize a functional tryptophan biosynthetic operon in trp-deficient E. coli by delivering individual recombination cassettes or trpA-E genes along with regulatory elements with the integron system.\n\nThis method generates single stranded DNA strands, which encompass a single block sequence either at the 5' or 3' end, complementary sequences in a stem loop region, and a D branch region serving as a primer binding site for PCR. Equivalent amounts of both 5' and 3' half strands are mixed and formed a hybrid due to the complementarity in the stem region. Hybrids with free phosphorylated 5' end in 3' half strands are then ligated with free 3' ends in 5' half strands using T4 DNA ligase in the presence of 0.1 mM ATP. Ligated products are then amplified by two types of PCR to generate pre 5' half and pre 3' half PCR products. These PCR product are converted to single strands via avidin-biotin binding to the 5' end of the primes containing stem sequences that were biotin labeled. Next, biotinylated 5' half strands and non-biotinylated 3' half strands are used as 5' and 3' half strands for the next Y-ligation cycle.\n\nSemi-rational design uses information about a proteins sequence, structure and function, in tandem with predictive algorithms. Together these are used to identify target amino acid residues which are most likely to influence protein function. Mutations of these key amino acid residues create libraries of mutant proteins that are more likely to have enhanced properties.\n\nAdvances in semi-rational enzyme engineering and de novo enzyme design provide researchers with powerful and effective new strategies to manipulate biocatalysts. Integration of sequence and structure based approaches in library design has proven to be a great guide for enzyme redesign. Generally, current computational de novo and redesign methods do not compare to evolved variants in catalytic performance. Although experimental optimization may be produced using directed evolution, further improvements in the accuracy of structure predictions and greater catalytic ability will be achieved with improvements in design algorithms. Further functional enhancements may be included in future simulations by integrating protein dynamics.\n\nBiochemical and biophysical studies, along with fine-tuning of predictive frameworks will be useful to experimentally evaluate the functional significance of individual design features. Better understanding of these functional contributions will then give feedback for the improvement of future designs.\n\nDirected evolution will likely not be replaced as the method of choice for protein engineering, although computational protein design has fundamentally changed the way protein engineering can manipulate bio-macromolecules. Smaller, more focused and functionally-rich libraries may be generated by using in methods which incorporate predictive frameworks for hypothesis-driven protein engineering. New design strategies and technical advances have begun a departure from traditional protocols, such as directed evolution, which represents the most effective strategy for identifying top-performing candidates in focused libraries. Whole-gene library synthesis is replacing shuffling and mutagenesis protocols for library preparation. Also highly specific low throughput screening assays are increasingly applied in place of monumental screening and selection efforts of millions of candidates. Together, these developments are poised to take protein engineering beyond directed evolution and towards practical, more efficient strategies for tailoring biocatalysts.\n\nOnce a protein has undergone directed evolution, ration design or semi-ration design, the libraries of mutant proteins must be screened to determine which mutants show enhanced properties. Phage display methods are one option for screening proteins. This method involves the fusion of genes encoding the variant polypeptides with phage coat protein genes. Protein variants expressed on phage surfaces are selected by binding with immobilized targets in vitro. Phages with selected protein variants are then amplified in bacteria, followed by the identification of positive clones by enzyme linked immunosorbent assay. These selected phages are then subjected to DNA sequencing.\n\nCell surface display systems can also be utilized to screen mutant polypeptide libraries. The library mutant genes are incorporated into expression vectors which are then transformed into appropriate host cells. These host cells are subjected to further high throughput screening methods to identify the cells with desired phenotypes.\n\nCell free display systems have been developed to exploit \"in vitro\" protein translation or cell free translation. These methods include mRNA display, ribosome display, covalent and non covalent DNA display, and \"in vitro\" compartmentalization.\n\nEnzyme engineering is the application of modifying an enzyme's structure (and, thus, its function) or modifying the catalytic activity of isolated enzymes to produce new metabolites, to allow new (catalyzed) pathways for reactions to occur, or to convert from some certain compounds into others (biotransformation). These products are useful as chemicals, pharmaceuticals, fuel, food, or agricultural additives.\n\nAn \"enzyme reactor\" consists of a vessel containing a reactional medium that is used to perform a desired conversion by enzymatic means. Enzymes used in this process are free in the solution.\n\nComputing methods have been used to design a protein with a novel fold, named Top7, and sensors for unnatural molecules. The engineering of fusion proteins has yielded rilonacept, a pharmaceutical that has secured Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval for treating cryopyrin-associated periodic syndrome.\n\nAnother computing method, IPRO, successfully engineered the switching of cofactor specificity of Candida boidinii xylose reductase. Iterative Protein Redesign and Optimization (IPRO) redesigns proteins to increase or give specificity to native or novel substrates and cofactors. This is done by repeatedly randomly perturbing the structure of the proteins around specified design positions, identifying the lowest energy combination of rotamers, and determining whether the new design has a lower binding energy than prior ones.\n\nComputation-aided design has also been used to engineer complex properties of a highly ordered nano-protein assembly. A protein cage, E. coli bacterioferritin (EcBfr), which naturally shows structural instability and an incomplete self-assembly behavior by populating two oligomerization states, is the model protein in this study. Through computational analysis and comparison to its homologs, it has been found that this protein has a smaller-than-average dimeric interface on its two-fold symmetry axis due mainly to the existence of an interfacial water pocket centered on two water-bridged asparagine residues. To investigate the possibility of engineering EcBfr for modified structural stability, a semi-empirical computational method is used to virtually explore the energy differences of the 480 possible mutants at the dimeric interface relative to the wild type EcBfr. This computational study also converges on the water-bridged asparagines. Replacing these two asparagines with hydrophobic amino acids results in proteins that fold into alpha-helical monomers and assemble into cages as evidenced by circular dichroism and transmission electron microscopy. Both thermal and chemical denaturation confirm that, all redesigned proteins, in agreement with the calculations, possess increased stability. One of the three mutations shifts the population in favor of the higher order oligomerization state in solution as shown by both size exclusion chromatography and native gel electrophoresis.\n\n\n"}

Founded by Norwegian missionaries of the Norwegian Missionary Society, and partly funded by a wealthy American donator in Cameroon and the Evangelical Lutheran Church of Cameroon, the hospital has been in full operation since 1957. The Protestant Hospital of Ngaound√©r√© today employs over 127 people.\n\nIn 1931 Norwegian missionaries Mr and Mrs Endressen arrived at Ngaound√©r√© from Madagascar. Mr. Endressen was pastor while his wife is a nurse. They began medical work, visiting patients at home and treating them. Given the sheer number of patients who flocked to her, she had to ask the mission to build a room where she could hospitalize those who required a formal observation. A straw huts was erected, with one room serving as a hospital room for men and the second for women. Endressen also initiated a health education program in the neighborhoods. She taught in particular the prevention of certain diseases such as malaria, tuberculosis, intestinal worms and other sexually transmitted diseases (STDs).\n\nIn 1935 however, she succumbed to illness herself and was forced to return to Norway, closing the clinic. Three years later, however, she returned in 1938 and resumed her activities. Desiring a hospital to undertake the great work, one evening she went to the present site of the hospital and prayed to God for a hospital being built. At that time, the site was not yet chosen. The Sudan Mission had already issued in 1945 the idea of collaborating with the NMS and the Fraternal Lutheran Mission (MFL) north of Cameroon for the establishment of a hospital because they lacked the funds for the construction of a hospital. This hospital should be beneficial not only for the indigenous population but also for the care for the missionaries in the area. By this time, however, the government had begun construction of a hospital in Meiganga and would not consider building another hospital and the initial proposals were rejected due to strong opposition. In 1947, however, the NMS decided to send a doctor to aid the work of Endressen. Dr. Bernt Sigurd Bjaanes, a Norwegian who had arrived with his wife in Cameroon in December 1947.\nIn 1948 a new plan was presented by the Pastor Endressen Pastor and in June of that year John Fosse, a nurse and deacon arrived and three Cameroonian medical students were added to this team. One died and was replaced by another Cameroonian, Moussa Martin, and the three students would become part of the first class of nursing students in 1954. In 1949 the idea of the creation of the Ngaound√©r√© Protestant Hospital was already well advanced and the site that should accommodate the hospital was found. That same year, the Directorate of NMS sent a Norwegian architect Ove Aasen, to start construction work on the clinic of Dr. Bjaanes and the hospital. When Dr. Syrdal became Superintendent of the NMS he made a great effort to reach an agreement with the Sudan Mission to build a hospital in Ngaound√©r√© in the early 1950s. This reached a climax at a meeting on 2 February 1953 to clarify things.\n\nFollowing this development, it was now under consideration to finance the construction of the hospital. As stated above, the SM had already received enough money to build a hospital but this was not enough money to build a common hospital. In addition, the economic situation of the NMS became increasingly critical, which did not allow him to continue funding the construction of the hospital despite the fact that construction work had already started. On the proposal of Pastor Keller, secretary of the Mission, a request for assistance was sent to a French organization FIDES. A sum of 100 million francs had been requested, but only 2,882,000 francs have been achieved. FIDES were interested in particular in surgery and dentistry facilities but were not willing to finance the whole unit. By circumstance, a rich American named Young was in Cameroon and promised to contribute a sum of $ 25,000 enabling the construction of the hospital which would not only enabled full services to be provided but would finance the building of a school for nurses, and homes of the doctors and some nurses. In a letter dated 20 April 1954, Young also promised to pay the operating costs of the hospital for a minimum period of 5 years and a maximum period of 10 years. The generous donation was regarded by the missionaries as a gift from God enabling the creation of an advanced hospital in Ngaound√©r√©.\n\nA construction committee was appointed to conduct the work until its completion. This committee was composed by Oscar Noss (SM) and Ada Kopstad (NMS). The use of the donation of 25,000 dollars was directly used for the construction of 2 buildings of 5 rooms for patients (50,000 francs), hospital equipment with a value of 305 000 francs, a building for a dental clinic (500 000 francs), dental equipment (500,000 francs), dental surgery (720 000 francs), a pavilion for whites, which would include 4 hospital rooms, two dining rooms, two kitchens, four showers and toilets and an exam room and deliveries (1,350 000 francs), and a chapel and a classroom for medical students (500 000 francs). The land on which the hospital was built Ngaound√©r√© was awarded to the Norwegian Mission by Order No. 353 of 24 June 1949. Ove Aasen was the principal architect of the hospital. On the request, the High Commissioner of the Republic of Cameroon residing in Yaound√© on 4 September 1952, according to plan which was presented by Mr. Endressen, authorised the outbuildings, a clinic, four hospital units, a sterilization facility, and the installation of water and sanitation.\n\nIn 1956 the Young Foundation gave a total of 48,800 dollars that helped build a pavilion surgery, a dental clinic, the dentist's residence, and even the house of Aasen the architect. It also built an annex for the hospital, two houses for nurses, a kitchen for the surgical pavilion, a room for the generator, ten hospital rooms and an office amounting to 41,600 dollars. It was completed in 1957 and plays an important role in healthcare in the city and surrounding area today.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "5953219", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=5953219", "title": "Refeeding syndrome", "text": "Refeeding syndrome\n\nRefeeding syndrome is a syndrome consisting of metabolic disturbances that occur as a result of reinstitution of nutrition to patients who are starved, severely malnourished or metabolically stressed due to severe illness. When too much food and/or liquid nutrition supplement is consumed during the initial four to seven days of refeeding, this triggers synthesis of glycogen, fat and protein in cells, to the detriment of serum (blood) concentrations of potassium, magnesium, and phosphorus. Cardiac, pulmonary and neurological symptoms can be signs of refeeding syndrome. The low serum minerals, if severe enough, can be fatal.\n\nAny individual who has had negligible nutrient intake for many consecutive days and/or is metabolically stressed from a critical illness or major surgery is at risk of refeeding syndrome. Refeeding syndrome usually occurs within four days of starting to re-feed. Patients can develop fluid and electrolyte disorders, especially hypophosphatemia, along with neurologic, pulmonary, cardiac, neuromuscular, and hematologic complications.\n\nDuring fasting the body switches its main fuel source from carbohydrates to fat tissue fatty acids and amino acids as the main energy sources. The spleen decreases its rate of red blood cell breakdown thus conserving red blood cells. Many intracellular minerals become severely depleted during this period, although serum levels remain normal. Importantly, insulin secretion is suppressed in this fasted state and glucagon secretion is increased.\n\nDuring refeeding, insulin secretion resumes in response to increased blood sugar, resulting in increased glycogen, fat and protein synthesis. This process requires phosphates, magnesium and potassium which are already depleted and the stores rapidly become used up. Formation of phosphorylated carbohydrate compounds in the liver and skeletal muscle depletes intracellular ATP and 2,3-diphosphoglycerate in red blood cells, leading to cellular dysfunction and inadequate oxygen delivery to the body's organs. Refeeding increases the basal metabolic rate. Intracellular movement of electrolytes occurs along with a fall in the serum electrolytes, including phosphorus and magnesium. Levels of serum glucose may rise and the B vitamin thiamine may fall. Abnormal heart rhythms are the most common cause of death from refeeding syndrome, with other significant risks including confusion, coma and convulsions and cardiac failure.\n\nThis syndrome can occur at the beginning of treatment for anorexia nervosa when patients have an increase in calorie intake and can be fatal. It can also occur after the onset of a severe illness or major surgery. The shifting of electrolytes and fluid balance increases cardiac workload and heart rate. This can lead to acute heart failure. Oxygen consumption is also increased which strains the respiratory system and can make weaning from ventilation more difficult.\n\nRefeeding syndrome can be fatal if not recognized and treated properly. An awareness of the condition and a high index of suspicion are required in order to make the diagnosis. The electrolyte disturbances of the refeeding syndrome can occur within the first few days of refeeding. Close monitoring of blood biochemistry is therefore necessary in the early refeeding period. \n\nIn critically ill patients admitted to an intensive care unit, if phosphate drops to below 0.65¬†mmol/L (2.0¬†mg/dL) from a previously normal level within three days of starting enteral or parenteral nutrition, caloric intake should be reduced to 480 kcals per day for at least two days whilst electrolytes are replaced. Prescribing thiamine, vitamin B complex (strong) and a multivitamin and mineral preparation is recommended. Biochemistry should be monitored regularly until it is stable. Although clinical trials are lacking in patients other than those admitted to an intensive care, it is commonly recommended that energy intake should remain lower than that normally required for the first 3‚Äì5 days of treatment of refeeding syndrome.\n\nSee NICE Clinical guideline CG32, section 6.6. On first aid and preliminary medical management, see for example the guidance by HMS Monmouth medical officer.\nA common error, repeated in multiple papers, is that \"The syndrome was first \ndescribed after World War II in Americans who, held by the Japanese as prisoners of war, had become malnourished during captivity and who were then released to the care of United States personnel in the Philippines.\" However, closer inspection of the 1951 paper by Schnitker reveals the prisoners under study were not American POWs but Japanese soldiers who, already malnourished, surrendered in the Philippines during 1945, after the war was over. \n\nIt is difficult to ascertain when the syndrome was first discovered and named, but it is likely the associated electrolyte disturbances were identified well before 1951, perhaps in Holland during the closing months of World War II, before Victory Day in Europe. There are also anecdotal eyewitness reports from a still earlier time of Polish prisoners in Iran who were freed from Soviet camps in 1941‚Äì1942 under an amnesty to form an army under General Anders and were given food whilst in a state of starvation which caused many to die.\n\nThe Roman Historian Flavius Josephus writing in first century the described classic symptoms of the syndrome among survivors of the siege of Jerusalem. He described the death of those who over indulged in food after famine, whereas those who ate a more restrained pace survived.\n\nIn his 5th century BCE work 'On Fleshes' (De Carnibus), Hippocrates writes, \"if a person goes\nseven days without eating or drinking anything, in this period most die; but there are some who survive that time\nbut still die, and others are persuaded not to starve themselves to death but to eat and drink: however, the cavity\nno longer admits anything because the jejunum (n√™stis) has grown together in that many days, and these people\ntoo die.\" Though Hippocrates misidentifies the exact cause of death, this passage likely represents an early description of Refeeding Syndrome.\n\n"}

{"id": "2409816", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2409816", "title": "Richard Isay", "text": "Richard Isay\n\nRichard A. Isay (December 13, 1934 ‚Äì June 28, 2012) was an American psychiatrist, psychoanalyst, author and gay activist. He was a professor of psychiatry at Weill Cornell Medical College and a faculty member of the Columbia University Center for Psychoanalytic Training and Research. Isay is considered a pioneer who changed the way that psychoanalysts view homosexuality.\n\nRichard Isay was born and raised in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. Isay graduated from Haverford College and the University of Rochester School of Medicine and Dentistry. Soon after completing his psychiatry residency at Yale University, he completed his training at the Western New England Psychoanalytic Institute. Throughout his career, Isay maintained a private practice of psychiatry and psychoanalysis and was an influential teacher and supervisor. He was the program chairman of the American Psychoanalytic Association (APsaA), the American Program Chairman of the International Psychoanalytical Association and chairman of the Committee on Gay, Lesbian and Bisexual Issues of the American Psychiatric Association.\n\nIn 1983, as chair of the APsaA's program committee, Isay organized a panel called \"New Perspectives on Homosexuality\". Isay argued that homosexuality is a normal variant of sexual identity, and that psychoanalysts should stop trying to change the sexual orientation of their patients, which he considered injurious, creating a firestorm of controversy. \"Several analysts walked out\", Isay later recalled. Isay soon became the first openly gay member of the association.\nIsay wrote widely on the subjects of psychoanalysis and homosexuality, including texts such as \"Being Homosexual: Gay Men and Their Development\". \"Being Homosexual\" was one of the first books to argue that homosexuality is an inborn identity, and the first to describe a non-pathological developmental pathway that is specific to gay men. It is widely considered a breakthrough in psychoanalytic theory and an important, historical work.\n\nIn an autobiographical chapter of his book, \"Becoming Gay: The Journey to Self-Acceptance\", Isay tells the story of how he spent ten years trying to change his homosexual orientation. During his analysis, he married. After completing his analysis, he realized that he was, in fact, gay. He was closeted in his professional life for several years, during which time he became a prominent member of the American Psychoanalytic Association. He began to write about homosexuality shortly after meeting his life partner and future husband, Gordon Harrell, in 1979.\n\nIn \"Becoming Gay\", Isay recounts that with the help of the American Civil Liberties Union, he threatened to sue the APsaA, due to their discriminatory policies. As a result, on May 9, 1991, the APsaA adopted a non-discrimination policy for the training of analytic candidates and changed its position statement on homosexuality. 1991 was also the year that the APsaA agreed to allow gays and lesbians to become training analysts, and to promote gay and lesbian teachers and supervisors.\n\nThis fundamental change in position by the APsaA created a ripple effect that was felt throughout the profession. The ApsaA was and is the preeminent psychoanalytic organization in the world. These changes of position and practice by the APsaA became a stimulus for reform. They were slowly copied by psychoanalytic, psychiatric, psychological and social work organizations internationally. A few years later, these changes were adopted by psychoanalytic groups in the UK.\n\nIsay was an early proponent of gay marriage. In 1989 Isay told \"U.S. News & World Report\": \"If the time comes in which there's a change to society's attitude toward homosexuality - when, for example, gay marriages and adoptions are possible and gay couples reap the same social benefits as heterosexual couples - I believe there will be a corresponding change in the behavior of gay men, with much less emphasis on the sexual act and more emphasis on relationships\". This was long before gay marriage had become an issue within the mainstream, LGBT community.\n\nSubsequently, the APsaA became the first national mental health organization to support gay marriage, in 1997; a policy that was spearheaded by Isay.\n\nIn his 2006 book, \"Commitment and Healing: Gay Men and the Need for Romantic Love\", Isay describes the difficulty many gay men have sustaining romantic, loving relationships.\n\nIsay appeared on \"Larry King Live\", \"The Oprah Winfrey Show\", \"20/20\", \"The Morning Show\" and others.\n\nIn 1993 Isay was featured in the documentary \"America Undercover: Why am I Gay? Stories of Coming Out in America.\"\n\nIn 1995 Isay was profiled in the book, \"Gay Soul: Finding the Heart of Gay Spirit and Nature\", by Mark Thompson.\n\nOn August 13, 2011, Isay married Gordon Harrell, his partner of 32 years.\n\nOn November 12, 2011, Isay received the highly prestigious Hans W. Loewald award, from the International Forum on Psychoanalytic Education.\n\nIsay died on June 28, 2012, of complications of adenocarcinoma. He was interred at Green-Wood Cemetery in Brooklyn, New York.\n\nOn June 14, 2014, Isay was featured in the first gay themed tour of Green-Wood Cemetery. Since 2014, the \"Gay Grave Tour\", as it's now called, has become part of Green-Wood Cemetery's annual summer program.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "11998141", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=11998141", "title": "SafetyLit", "text": "SafetyLit\n\nSafetyLit (short for \"Safety Literature\") is a bibliographic database and online update of recently published scholarly research of relevance to those interested in the broad field of injury prevention and safety promotion. Initiated in 1995, SafetyLit is a project of the SafetyLit Foundation in cooperation with the San Diego State University College of Health & Human Services and the World Health Organization - Department of Violence and Injury Prevention.\n\nLike the US National Library of Medicine's (NLM) PubMed system, SafetyLit is a free service that is distributed without commercial messages. There are many online literature databases. Most are subscription-based, costly and are available only through a library. Typically, these databases focus on a specific scientific discipline. For example, PubMed has a bio-medicine focus, PsycINFO focuses upon behavioral issues, Compendex on engineering, etc.\n\nWhile other bibliographic databases can focus upon the publications of only one or two professional disciplines, it has been known since the early 20th Century that issues relevant to safety research and policy development arise from many distinct disciplines. Thus, SafetyLit draws its content from many disciplines. Articles are selected that are relevant to the issues of injury prevention and safety promotion from over 16000 scholarly journals (as of January 2016) in the physical, biological and social sciences, as well as engineering, medicine, and the applied social sciences. SafetyLit also indexes selected doctoral theses and relevant technical reports from government agencies and NGOs.\n\nThe idea for SafetyLit came from an electronic mailing list service provided in the early-1990s by the librarians at the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), National Center for Injury Prevention and Control (NCIPC). This bibliographic update was a print-out of article citations from Medline that were indexed with selected MeSH terms related to the treatment and prevention of injuries. This free service was provided at a time when searching Medline was quite costly. The NCIPC update service ended in 1994, about one year before the National Library of Medicine began providing an experimental version of PubMed.\n\nTo help fill the gap from that loss, SafetyLit began in early 1995 as a simple email message sent to about 20 people who were affiliated with the CDC-funded state Disability Prevention Programs in Louisiana and a few other U.S. states. As more and more people learned about SafetyLit, the mailing list expanded. By the end of 1998 the updates were circulated to more than 5000 addresses. By the close of 1999 the address list had expanded beyond 15,000.\n\nDuring 1999, several publishing companies began supplying their journal article citation and abstract data to SafetyLit and the journal sources expanded far beyond what was available through PubMed. In 2001 the SafetyLit update service moved from a series of lengthy flat-file newsletters to a database-driven dynamic website. The email newsletter became a simple announcement that a pdf version of Update Bulletin is available on the SafetyLit website. With that improvement, an archive database with search capacity was established. From that time forward, each week brought the addition of about 300-400 recently published articles and more than 250 articles from the back-files of journals that published relevant material.\nIn mid-2013, to sustain the contents of the languishing VioLit database, SafetyLit formed a partnership with the Center for the Study and Prevention of Violence (CSPV), a research program of the Institute of Behavioral Science (IBS) at the University of Colorado at Boulder. The VioLit database, had items related to preventing youth violence with most records including a thorough review written by CSPV experts. The VioLit expanded article reviews are being added to existing SafetyLit records where there is overlap of the database contents and VioLit items that had been missing from SafetyLit are being added.\n\nIn mid-2014 the static parts of the SafetyLit website became available in 17 languages (with localization) by expert translators. The content of article summaries is available in many languages through machine translation (Google).\n\nAlthough SafetyLit began with a focus upon articles from scholarly journals, in early 2013 it expanded to include books (and book chapters) and the gray literature (academic doctoral theses, reports from scientific research groups, working papers, etc.).\n\nInformation about the 16,000-plus serials indexed in SafetyLit is found in the SafetyLit Journals Database that lists journal title and current publisher, title abbreviation, both the print and electronic International Standard Serial Number (pISSN and eISSN), the range of years the journal has been published, the journal's previous or subsequent titles, and a link to the journal's pages on the publisher's website. Each journal listing includes a link to the OCLC WorldCat \"find item in a nearby library\" service.\n\nSafetyLit draws from journals that publish material that has been subjected to peer review. Most articles in SafetyLit are written in the English language or contain titles and abstracts in English. However, the abstracts of some non-English articles are included after translation to English by staff or volunteers. Titles and abstracts in the original language are retained. SafetyLit staff and volunteers regularly hand-examine (issue by issue) more than 3800 current scholarly journals from many nations to find relevant material. Other journals are scanned at least once per volume.\n\nIn mid-January 2013, SafetyLit announced that it was accepting submissions of academic doctoral theses on relevant topics (see below). In early February of that year, more than 150 theses from 18 universities had been added.\n\nSafetyLit includes summaries of \"scholarly\" reports, conference proceedings, and journal articles about injury occurrence and risk factors. More specifically, items are considered relevant if they concern any of the pre-event or event elements of the Haddon Matrix; the epidemiology of injury and injury risk factors; or the financial, personal, or societal costs or consequences of the any injury or risk factor.\n\nAlthough items are screened for relevant content, SafetyLit makes no attempt to screen for quality. The nature and rigor of the peer review process at one journal may be quite different from other journals. The same may be said for academic programs, book publishers, government agencies, etc. The SafetyLit site contains the following statement:\n\nThere are several very good bio-medicine databases that index articles about the assessment and the medical and surgical treatment of injuries (i.e. Medline, EMBASE, Scopus). Thus, in general, articles concerning medical treatment for injuries or complications of medical care are excluded except when the article also contains information on one of the inclusion criteria. Similarly, articles that focus upon routine road or building repair and maintenance are excluded except when those articles are relevant to safety. SafetyLit also includes reports on other topics that may help a reader to make decisions about research or prevention strategies and priorities.\n\nThe Weekly Update Bulletin is a pdf document containing citations of about 400 new items. Clicking on the title of the item will provide more detail such as an abstract or a link to the full text if these are available. Items are listed under 38 interest categories. The purpose of the categories within SafetyLit is to make it easy for subscribers to the Weekly Update Bulletin to limit their content only to the topics that are within the sphere of their interest.\n\nItems are assigned multiple categories based upon the answer to the question, \"Might someone with an interest in (category) find this article useful or interesting?\" For example, a journal article concerning a physiological basis for deep emotional depression could be assigned to the Suicide and Self-Harm category even if suicide is not mentioned in the article text.\n\nThe contents of the weekly update are available 4 ways:\n\n1. A PDF file is posted each Monday before 0100 UTC to the SafetyLit website (http://www.safetylit.org/archive.php). The current and past versions of the Weekly Update Bulletin may be found via the 'Browse archives' link from the SafetyLit homepage. The PDF file contains bookmarks that allow a reader to jump directly to any category without needing to scroll through 50-plus pages of citations to get to their category of interest. Those who wish to do so may subscribe to an email notice that will alert them when the bulletin is available at an earlier hour.\n\n2. The new week's citations and abstracts are available in html format at 0100 UTC each Monday by clicking on the 'View current abstracts' link from the SafetyLit home page. (After this time the previous week's material is only available by viewing the appropriate PDF file on the Browse Archives pages or by searching the database.) From here it is possible to scroll through all the week's citations and abstracts or to check selected tick boxes to limit the scope of articles to certain interest categories.\n\n3. A frequent SafetyLit user may avoid the need to tick or un-tick category select-boxes by registering and signing up for a personalized custom listing of articles. This 'My SafetyLit' option allows a user to record the category or categories they want to view each week. Users may allow their browser to automatically log them in and effortlessly view only the citations and abstracts that match their custom setting.\n\n4. Each of the SafetyLit categories is available via RSS feed. A feed with an unduplicated listing (without categories) of all articles is also available. This allows readers to receive new articles throughout the week as they are entered into SafetyLit or at any interval (from immediately upon posting up to once per month) that they desire.\n\nThe SafetyLit database contains more than 515,000 journal articles (as of 12 October 2016) with more than 400 articles and 50 gray literature items being added each week. The database may be searched by author name or textword using the basic search screen or, if the advanced search screen is used, by author name, author ORCID ID number, textword (with wildcard characters and truncation), hybrid textword+synonyms, or journal using Boolean operators.\n\nThe textword+synonyms search uses the SafetyLit Thesaurus to allow a query to take advantage of synonym ring and hierarchical term searching. The synonym ring function allows a searcher to use a single textword such as 'baby walker' to substitute for doing a series of regular textword searches using the 15 other terms by which the device is known. The entry of a single term in the textword+synonym box will produce a listing of \"all\" articles with text containing \"any\" of the synonyms for that term.\n\nThe search system recognizes ambiguous English language query terms and offers more focused options. (See below.)\n\nThe SafetyLit Thesaurus is the basis for hybrid textword+synonym search capacity. There are often many synonyms and spelling variants for potential search terms. New terms and synonyms are added weekly. Work on the SafetyLit thesaurus is not finished, so the full hierarchical search system is not yet complete. However, some term hierarchies such as geographic area names are available for searching. For example, an index term search using ‚ÄòAustralia‚Äô will find articles that contain the words ‚ÄòCanberra‚Äô, ‚ÄòAdelaide‚Äô, or ‚ÄòPerth‚Äô, even if the SafetyLit records do not contain the word ‚ÄòAustralia‚Äô. The SafetyLit Thesaurus is built on a modified version of TemaTres open-source software.\n\nThe thesaurus-aided search system also allows for word-sense disambiguation. For example, a query using the term \"football\" will return a disambiguation screen that provides for the selection of any of several options for the various game types (American football, Association football (soccer), Australian-rules football, Canadian football, Flag football, Gaelic football, etc.) each with different rules and player protection.\n\nAll resources found from a query of the SafetyLit database are directly available to the free Zotero reference management software. Records may also be downloaded in RIS, ENW, and BibTeX formats for import into other software such as EndNote, Mendeley, Papers, etc. The metadata for each SafetyLit record is silently available in COinS, unAPI, and Google Scholar/Highwire Press metadata formats.\n\nResearchers and policymakers who address controversial safety-related issues have been targets of threats or violence for hundreds of years from those with strong feelings who wish to obstruct certain knowledge for the basis of evidence-based policy. More recently, researchers and their institutions have come under attack for work in the areas of firearms and motorcycle helmets. These sorts of things are known because they have been the subject of editorials in journals and even print and broadcast news stories. However, providers of scholarly information such as SafetyLit have also been harmed by those who disagree with part of its content. Some SafetyLit readers write letters to the agencies and organizations that provide funding for the project. Others take more extreme action to make their point. Distributed denial of service (DDoS) attacks have been made against the SafetyLit servers. Other attackers organized their interest groups to subscribe to the SafetyLit email service and then to label the SafetyLit messages as unsolicited spam by using their internet service providers' automated reporting process. This in an unsuccessful attempt to block all users of that ISP from receiving SafetyLit email messages.\n\nSome of the topics that bring the most complaints are not what might be expected:\n\n\n"}
{"id": "50681778", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=50681778", "title": "Smoking in North Korea", "text": "Smoking in North Korea\n\nTobacco smoking is popular and, at least for men, culturally acceptable in North Korea. , some 45% of men are reported to smoke daily, whilst in contrast only 2.5% of women smoke daily, with most of these being older women from rural areas. Smoking is a leading cause of death in North Korea, and mortality figures indicate that 34% of men and 22% of women die due to smoking-related causes, the highest mortality figures in the world. There are tobacco control programs in North Korea, and although smoking is not prohibited in all public spaces, the smoking rates have declined since their peak in the 2000s.\n\nAll three leaders of North Korea‚ÄîKim Il-sung, Kim Jong-il, and Kim Jong-un; have been smokers and the country has struggled to balance their public image with its anti-smoking efforts. In general, North Koreans tend to prefer strong tobacco and different classes of quality range from homegrown to sought-after foreign brands that are considered status symbols. As a percentage of the available arable land compared to consumption, the tobacco crop is over-represented in North Korean agriculture.\n\nOver 4,569,000 adults and 167,000 children in North Korea are believed to consume tobacco daily. It is estimated by the World Lung Foundation and American Cancer Society's \"The Tobacco Atlas\" (2014 data) that 45% of men, 2.5% of women, nearly 16% of boys and <1% of girls (aged <15) are daily smokers, with the average smoker (data is likely skewed towards males due to the higher prevalence of smoking in this group) smoking an average of 609 cigarettes per person per year. World Health Organization (WHO) data is roughly comparable, with 44% of men classified as smokers (only 33% are classed as \"daily smokers\"), whilst North Korean anti-smoking authorities put the figure even higher, saying that some 54% of men are smokers.\n\nOverall, the average smoker consumes 12.4 cigarettes per day, with this figure rising slightly to 15 per day when just male smokers are considered. The average smoker starts smoking at the age of 23 and the percentage of the population that smokes increases with age until the 55‚Äì64 age group, after which it declines. On average, people who live in urban areas tend to smoke more cigarettes per day than rural farmers.\n\nData indicates that the prevalence of smoking in North Korea is on par with South Korea, although South Korean men pick up the habit earlier and smoke more cigarettes per day. The high rate of smoking in South Korea is possibly due to it being a capitalist society, where marketing is prevalent and consumption is uncontrolled. \n\nHowever, much of the current information regarding the smoking habits of North Koreans is obtained by studying North Korean defectors who now live in South Korea and may not be totally representative of the true picture. One study of defectors found that smoking is even more common than anticipated, but nicotine dependence was not as severe as predicted. Defectors are reported as often being very interested in quitting smoking.\n\nTobacco first arrived in Korea in the early-1600s from Japan and until around 1880, both men and women smoked. Today, North Koreans consider smoking to be a normal activity for men, but female smoking has become a social taboo.\n\nAll of North Korea's three leaders‚ÄîKim Jong-un, his father Kim Jong-il and grandfather Kim Il-sung; have been smokers. Kim Jong-il has called smokers one of the \"three main fools of the 21st century\", along with people who do not understand music or computers. The current leader Kim Jong-un is often seen smoking in public, including in university classrooms, subway carriages, and in the presence of his pregnant wife Ri Sol-ju, facts that \"might make the life of the North Korean health educators more complicated.\" While discussing any negative aspects of the leaders has normally been rare, some North Koreans have recently raised the issue of the apparent contradiction between anti-smoking measures and Kim's public image with foreigners.\n\nFemale smoking is a taboo in North Korea and is considered even more disgraceful than heavy drinking. Women are said to \"react with shock if you joke that maybe they secretly smoke in bathrooms\". Smoking by older women, above the age of 45 to 50 is more tolerated, particularly in rural areas. In comparison, for men smoking is considered such an important social activity that men who do not smoke can become socially isolated at workplaces.\n\nEven though most consumer items are in short supply in North Korea, there is a considerable variety of cigarettes available. In general, strong tobacco is preferred, and filters are rare. Western brands, particularly American, but also Chinese, Russian and Japanese are popular with the elite and preferred over domestic cigarettes. Foreign cigarettes and the domestic 727 brand, whose name stands for 27 July, the date of the Korean Armistice Agreement; are veritable status symbols. Menthol cigarettes are virtually non-existent, but there is competition among tobacco companies to introduce other attractive products, such as fruit-flavoured balls inside the filter to give the cigarette a more distinct flavour.\n\nThose who have hard currency can easily buy imported cigarettes from hard currency shops, although these will also stock the best domestic brands (such as Pak Ma, comparable in quality to makhorka) to convince tourists of the quality of North Korean tobacco. Cigarettes are popular gifts, and tourists are recommended to give Western brands of cigarettes to tour guides. Within the country, cigarettes are used as form of currency in bribery.\nThose who roll their own tobacco prefer to use sheets of \"Rodong Sinmun\"‚Äîthe organ of the Central Committee of the ruling Workers' Party of Korea‚Äîas rolling paper. One piece of the paper can be used to roll some 40-50 cigarettes. According to one defector, when a North Korean \"starts to smoke the \"Rodong Sinmun\" tobacco, he cannot smoke other kinds of tobacco. I used to smoke the \"Rodong Sinmun\" tobacco, and after defection, couldn't smoke with Chinese paper tobacco due to the poor taste.\" Because the \"Rodong Sinmun\" is in limited circulation, most North Koreans roll their cigarettes with some other paper.\n\nThe health impacts of smoking are well documented and in North Korea the high prevalence of smoking has a significant impact on the health of the population. Some 34.3% of men and 22.3% of women are reported to die as a result of smoking, the highest smoking mortality figures in the world, and in total tobacco-caused illness kills 55,600 North Koreans annually.\n\nTobacco is only sold at designated shops at a fixed price set by the government. , a 20-pack of the most common cigarette brand costs 246.38 KPW North Korean won (¬£0.21, US$0.27), whilst the cheapest 20-pack sells for as little as 7.47 won (¬£0.01, US$0.0083).\n\nNorth Korea has set up specific government objectives for tobacco control and there is a national agency to implement them, with eight full-time staff members. Although there is no free of charge smoking cessation quitline that smokers could phone and discuss their problems, most healthcare facilities offer support in cessation, including cessation programs and nicotine replacement therapy. Costs are covered for the patient partially, or in full by the state. In addition to regular healthcare clinics, there are eleven specialised anti-smoking centres in the country where consultation is free, but medicine is not. Of medicines, bupropion and varenicline are not legally available in North Korea, but herbal medicines are used as smoking cessation aids.\n\nThere have been attempts at anti-smoking movements \"across the generations\" in the country, with the earliest major campaign taking place in 2004. While early campaigns had little effect, they have become more frequent in the 2010s and restrictions on smoking have been observed more closely in recent years; consequently, since the early-2000s; smoking rates have started to decline. There are signs that the North Korean government takes anti-smoking campaigns more seriously than they did in the past. According to the WHO, North Korea now \"keenly celebrates World No Tobacco Day (WNTD) every year and disseminates information about tobacco use and its effect on health. The Government persuades public health institutions and the media to spread the information about the health effects of tobacco and its adverse impact on environmental protection and economic development.\"\n\nSmoking legislation in North Korea has tightened in recent years, although it is still relatively lax and has not had any really meaningful effect on curtailing smoking rates. The rules on where people can or cannot smoke are complex, with smoking prohibited on pavements, ferries, aircraft and at stations, in healthcare and educational facilities, pre-schools and nurseries, shops, theatres, cinemas, culture halls and conference rooms, historic and battle sites, and hotel lobbies. However, smoking is not prohibited in either private or work vehicles or on-board trains, at bus stops, near entrances to buildings, in universities, government offices, workplaces, restaurants, cafes, bars, or nightclubs.\nSome of the legislation is observed with high levels of compliance, but not uniformly throughout the country. There are not mandatory fines for smoking transgressions, although the newest 2016 anti-smoking campaign has seen fines issued and offenders threatened with images of them being broadcast on TV. Tobacco packaging warning messages are required on all types of packaging, but their appearance is not regulated in any way. They are usually printed in small print on the side of the package and only state that smoking is harmful to health. However, the descriptions must state the nicotine and tar content, must not be misleading and do need to be approved by local authorities. Graphic warning images that are now common worldwide have never appeared on packaging in North Korea.\n\nThere are no restrictions on tobacco advertising, although there are no advertising campaigns of any kind in North Korean media. Tobacco may not be sold to minors (those under the age of seventeen) and Cigarette machines are banned. North Korea imposes no kind of tax at all on tobacco, including specific excise, \"ad valorem\" excise, value-added tax, sales tax, or import duty. Electronic cigarettes are legal.\n\nNorth Korea signed the WHO Framework Convention on Tobacco Control on 17 June 2003 and ratified it on 27 April 2005.\n\nThe tobacco industry in North Korea is substantial, with 53,000 hectares (2.3% of its arable land) dedicated to tobacco cultivation. This is the fourth-highest percentage of arable land dedicated to tobacco in the world, with the annual output exceeding 80,000 tonnes, making North Korea one of the top 25 tobacco producers worldwide. This is despite 31% of North Koreans being malnourished. The best, strongest and most expensive tobacco comes from the north of the DPRK near the border with China.\n\nThere are many North Korean tobacco companies, making some 30 different types of cigarettes, with the biggest tobacco company being the North Korea General Tobacco Corporation. Some companies export tobacco to the Middle East and elsewhere, sometimes in partnership with foreign firms. For example, the Taedong River Tobacco Company and the Rason Shinhung Tobacco Company, both operating in the Rason Special Economic Zone, are partnered with the Chinese Jilin Tobacco. British American Tobacco also has business in the country, but it has reduced its involvement due to political pressure and public relations reasons. During the Cold War, North Korea paid for goods it imported from the Soviet Union with poor quality tobacco. Later, during the years of the Sunshine Policy, high-end Pyongyang brand cigarettes were exported to South Korea where they were popular among South Koreans who wanted to express a pro-reunification stance. There are some privately owned tobacco factories, some of which are known to produce counterfeit brand cigarettes for export as part of North Korea's illicit activities to earn hard currency. North Korea is one of the largest producers of counterfeit cigarettes in the world.\n\nLeaf tobacco is cheap and can be bought from markets to roll one's own cigarettes. Many rural farmers produce homegrown tobacco on their own plot of land, while others steal tobacco from co-operative farms for sale.\n\n\n"}

Straub founded the clinic in 1921. Dr. Straub was educated in Germany and came to practice in Hawaii in 1907. In 1910, he conceived the idea of forming a group of physicians to provide better, more specialized care for his patients. It, however, took over 10 years to bring this idea to fruition.\n\nThe first step in 1912 was the construction of a wood frame building at 410 South Beretania Street. Straub established his office on the first floor and his home on the second. By 1916 his practice had grown to the point that he recruited an assistant, Guy C. Milnor. Straub envisioned a clinic providing specialized care in five major fields: Obstetrics and Gynecology, Surgery, Internal Medicine, ENT, and Clinical Pathology. To this end, he next enlisted Arthur Jackson, a specialist in internal medicine in 1920 and the group carried on for a short time as Straub, Milnor, and Jackson.\n\nIn the latter part of 1920, Howard Clarke resigned his commission in the United States Army and joined as a specialist in Eye, Ear, Nose and Throat. Eric A Fennel also left the Army about this time and joined the group as pathologist.\n\nIn January, 1921, the five founding partners formally organized themselves as a legal partnership. At Straub's insistence the group he founded did not bear his name, and it was to be known simply as \"The Clinic\".\nA specialist in internal medicine and radiology, joined the clinic in 1921, a general surgeon in 1922, and a pediatrician joined in 1924.\n\nIn 1952 the clinic was renamed \"Straub Clinic\" in honor of Straub, who died in May, 1966.\n\nOn December 21, 2001 it became part of the Hawaii Pacific Health network.\n\nStraub currently has a total of 10 locations on 3 Hawaiian Islands: Oahu, Lanai, and Hawaii Island.\n"}

In October 2014, the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare capped admission and tuition fees at private medical colleges at 1,990,000 Bangladeshi taka (US$25,750 as of 2014) total for the five-year course.\n\nThe college admits only female students. Admission for Bangladeshis to the MBBS programmes at all medical colleges in Bangladesh (government and private) is conducted centrally by the Directorate General of Health Services (DGHS). It administers a written multiple choice question exam simultaneously throughout the country. Candidates are admitted based primarily on their score on this test, although grades at Secondary School Certificate (SSC) and Higher Secondary School Certificate (HSC) level also play a part. As of July 2014, the college is allowed to admit 90 students annually.\n\n"}
{"id": "2054459", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2054459", "title": "Urgent care centers", "text": "Urgent care centers\n\nUrgent care is a category of walk-in clinic focused on the delivery of ambulatory care in a dedicated medical facility outside of a traditional emergency department (emergency room). Urgent care centers primarily treat injuries or illnesses requiring immediate care, but not serious enough to require an emergency department (ED) visit. Urgent care centers are distinguished from similar ambulatory healthcare centers such as emergency departments and convenient care clinics by their scope of conditions treated and available facilities on-site.\n\nThe United States is seeing a rapid increase in the number of urgent care centres. In Europe and the United Kingdom, similar services are called walk-in centres. While urgent care centers are usually not open 24 hours a day, 70% of centers in the United States open by 8:00¬†a.m. or earlier and 95% close after 7:00¬†p.m.\n\nThe initial urgent care centers opened in the United States during the 1970s. Since then, this healthcare sector has rapidly expanded to approximately 10,000 centers across the United States. Many centers were started by emergency medicine physicians, responding to a public need for convenient access to unscheduled medical care. A significant factor for the increase of these centers is significant monetary savings when compared to EDs. Many managed care organizations (MCOs) now encourage or even require customers to utilize urgent care options. As of 2014, the urgent care industry is worth an estimated $14.5 billion.\n\nIn 2014, US communities with non-hospital-based urgent care centers (UCCs) were mainly urban, located in areas with higher income levels and higher levels of private insurance.\nKaissi et al. considered local multi-hospital systems in Florida, Maryland, Nevada, Texas, Virginia and Washington. In 2012 50% of 117 hospital-based \"clusters\" included either UCCs, retail clinics, or both. 57% of systems in Washington operated an UCC, compared to 36% of systems in Washington, while systems in Florida had the largest share of UCCs (17.6%). Authors noted unexplained state-by-state variation in hospital system partnership with UCC and retail clinic models. \nCorwin et al. considered Medicare beneficiaries presenting to an UCC (n=1,426,354) emergency department (ED) (n=334,841) or physicians office (n=8,359,498) with upper respiratory or urinary tract infections, bronchitis, sprains or contusions, and back or arthritic pain, in 2012. Patients who presented to an ED were more likely to be female (67% of ED presentations) compared to those who presented to a UCC or physicians office (65% and 64% respectively). Patients who presented to an UCC were significantly more likely to be aged over 85 (27%, compared to 15% of physicians office presentations, and 13% of ED presentations) or Black (11%, compared to 6% of physicians office presentations, and 4% of ED presentations).\nIn 2014, 3.1% of Family Physicians in the United States worked primarily in UCCs, with a male:female ratio of workforce is 6:7, and an urban:rural ratio of 2:1. This compares to 3.6% of Family Physicians working primarily in Emergency Care, with a male:female ratio of 5:3 and urban:rural ratio approaching 1:2.\n\nBoth the Urgent Care Association of America (UCAOA) and the American Academy of Urgent Care Medicine (AAUCM) have established criteria for urgent care centers and the physicians that operate them. Each share similar qualifying criteria including:\n\nThe UCAOA program is called Urgent Care Certification and the AAUCM is called Urgent Care Center Accreditation.\n\nThe Urgent Care Association of America (UCAOA) holds an annual spring convention and an annual fall conference. Founded in 2004, the UCAOA does not own any urgent care centers itself, but rather provides resources, training, and leadership to the industry. Many leaders of organized urgent care anticipate the establishment of urgent care as a fully recognized specialty. This organization launched an accreditation program in 2014, and has since partnered with an insurer called Urgent Care Assurance Company.\n\nUrgent Care Management Monthly hosts a bi-annual conference, teaching doctors, investors, and owners about the business side of an urgent care center.\nUrgent Care Management Monthly (UCMM) is the official publication for urgent care management, with discussions on topics such as billing, staffing, marketing, accounting, and logistics.\n\nJUCM, The Journal of Urgent Care Medicine is the Official Publication of the Urgent Care Association of America (UCAOA). Each issue contains peer-reviewed clinical and practice management articles.\n\nBoard of Certification in Urgent Care Medicine (BCUCM) provides board certification for physicians with requisite training and experience. The Urgent Care College of Physicians (UCCOP) offers educational programs for physicians in the urgent care field, and advocates for the field's overall status as a unique specialty.\n\nAnother entity, the American Board of Urgent Care Medicine (ABUCM), was founded in 1997. This organization provides certification to urgent care programs.\n\nIn 2006, the Urgent Care Association of America sponsored the first fellowship training program in urgent care medicine. A collaboration between the Department of Family Medicine University Hospitals of Cleveland / Case School of Medicine, the Urgent Care Association of America (UCAOA), and University Primary and Specialty Care Practices, Inc. in Cleveland, Ohio made this fellowship possible. The program was partially funded by an unrestricted grant from the Urgent Care Association of America. Fellowship physicians receive training in many disciplines, including: adult emergencies, pediatric emergencies, wound & injury evaluation and treatment, occupational medicine, urgent care procedures, and care center business aspects. In 2007, the Urgent Care Association of America (UCAOA) sponsored a second fellowship opportunity through the University of Illinois. The one-year fellowships are open to graduates of accredited Family Medicine and Med/Peds residencies.\n\nUnlike other walk-in clinics such as retail clinics, urgent care centers are generally staffed by a physician and supported by nurses, physician assistants and medical assistants. Sixty-five percent of urgent care centers have at least one physician on-site at all times.\n\nOf the physicians that staff urgent care centers, 47.8% are family medicine, 30.1% are emergency medicine and 7.6% are internal medicine.\n\nWith these licensed physician on-site, urgent care centers are able to offer a wide range of services including broken bones, moderate cuts and lacerations requiring stitches, and most common injuries and illnesses. These services, of course, are made possible with the diagnostic equipment and x-ray machines typically found at an urgent care.\n\nOf course, the urgent care centers are not an emergency department. They do not offer surgical services, as a rule- particularly invasive surgical procedures (more than cutaneous or subcutaneous procedures- those involving body organs and organ parts, and/or deep penetration of deep fascia, tendons, ligaments, bursae, joints, muscles, or bones), any procedures requiring the use of regional or general anesthesia (more than topical local anesthesia), those procedures requiring a full operating room or suite, having lengthy recovery times, or requiring more than the level of imaging or specialists available at the center.\n\nThat said, an estimated 13.7 to 27.1 percent of all emergency department visits could take place at an urgent care center or a retail clinic, generating a potential cost savings of approximately $4.4 billion annually, according to a 2010 study in \"Health Affairs\".\n\nThe majority of urgent care centers are owned by physicians or physician groups, however, more corporations and investment banks are acquiring urgent care centers and creating regional and national brands in the industry. The following is a breakdown of urgent care ownership following a 2012 study by the UCAOA:\n\nIn recent years the American Medical Association approved the code UCM (Urgent Care Medicine). This code allows physicians to self-designate as specializing in urgent care medicine. Services rendered in an urgent care center may be designated, using the place of service code -20 (POS -20) on the CMS-1500 form, as submitted to third-party payers. The Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) have designated two specific codes to apply to urgent care centers: S9083 (global fee for urgent care centers) and S9088 (services rendered in an urgent care center).\n\n"}
{"id": "170927", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=170927", "title": "Whooping cough", "text": "Whooping cough\n\nWhooping cough (also known as pertussis or 100-day cough) is a highly contagious bacterial disease. Initially, symptoms are usually similar to those of the common cold with a runny nose, fever, and mild cough. This is followed by weeks of severe coughing fits. Following a fit of coughing, a high-pitched whoop sound or gasp may occur as the person breathes in. The coughing may last for 10 or more weeks, hence the phrase \"100-day cough\". A person may cough so hard that they vomit, break ribs, or become very tired from the effort. Children less than one year old may have little or no cough and instead have periods where they do not breathe. The time between infection and the onset of symptoms is usually seven to ten days. Disease may occur in those who have been vaccinated, but symptoms are typically milder.\nPertussis is caused by the bacterium \"Bordetella pertussis\". It is an airborne disease which spreads easily through the coughs and sneezes of an infected person. People are infectious from the start of symptoms until about three weeks into the coughing fits. Those treated with antibiotics are no longer infectious after five days. Diagnosis is by collecting a sample from the back of the nose and throat. This sample can then be tested by either culture or by polymerase chain reaction.\nPrevention is mainly by vaccination with the pertussis vaccine. Initial immunization is recommended between six and eight weeks of age, with four doses to be given in the first two years of life. Protection from pertussis decreases over time, so additional doses of vaccine are often recommended for older children and adults. Antibiotics may be used to prevent the disease in those who have been exposed and are at risk of severe disease. In those with the disease, antibiotics are useful if started within three weeks of the initial symptoms, but otherwise have little effect in most people. In pregnant women and children less than one year old, antibiotics are recommended within six weeks of symptom onset. Antibiotics used include erythromycin, azithromycin, clarithromycin, or trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole. Evidence to support interventions for the cough, other than antibiotics, is poor. About 50% of infected children less than a year old require hospitalization and nearly 0.5% (1 in 200) die.\nAn estimated 16.3¬†million people worldwide were infected in 2015. Most cases occur in the developing world, and people of all ages may be affected. In 2015, pertussis resulted in 58,700 deaths ‚Äì down from 138,000 deaths in 1990. Outbreaks of the disease were first described in the 16th century. The bacterium that causes the infection was discovered in 1906. The pertussis vaccine became available in the 1940s.\n\nThe classic symptoms of pertussis are a paroxysmal cough, inspiratory whoop, and fainting, or vomiting after coughing. The cough from pertussis has been documented to cause subconjunctival hemorrhages, rib fractures, urinary incontinence, hernias, and vertebral artery dissection. Violent coughing can cause the pleura to rupture, leading to a pneumothorax. Vomiting after a coughing spell or an inspiratory whooping sound on coughing, almost doubles the likelihood that the illness is pertussis. The absence of a paroxysmal cough or posttussive emesis, though, makes it almost half as likely.\n\nThe illness usually starts with mild respiratory symptoms include mild coughing, sneezing, or a runny nose. This is known as the catarrhal stage. After one to two weeks, the coughing classically develops into uncontrollable fits, followed by a high-pitched \"whoop\" sound in younger children, or a gasping sound in older children, as the person tries to inhale (paroxysmal stage).\n\nThis stage usually lasts two to eight weeks, or sometimes longer. A gradual transition then occurs to the convalescent stage, which usually lasts one to four weeks. This stage is marked by a decrease in paroxysms of coughing, although paroxysms may occur with subsequent respiratory infection for many months after the onset of pertussis.\n\nThe time between exposure and the development of symptoms is on average 7‚Äì14 days (range 6‚Äì20 days), rarely as long as 42 days.\n\nPertussis is caused by the bacterium \"Bordetella pertussis\". It is an airborne disease (through droplets) that spreads easily through the coughs and sneezes of an infected person.\n\nUncertainties have existed of \"B. pertussis\" and whooping cough as a zoonotic disease since around 1910 but in the 1930s, knowledge was gained that the bacteria lost their virulent power when repeatedly spread on agar media. This explained the difficulties to reproduce results from different studies as the pre-inoculating handlings of the bacteria were not standardized among scientists.\n\nToday it is established that at least some primate species are highly susceptible to \"B. pertussis\" and develop clinical whooping cough in high incidence when exposed to low inoculation doses. The bacteria may be present in wild animal populations, but this is not confirmed by laboratory diagnosis, although whooping cough is known among wild gorillas. Several zoos also have a long-standing custom of vaccinating their primates against whooping cough.\n\nAfter the bacteria are inhaled, they initially adhere to the ciliated epithelium in the nasopharynx. Surface proteins of \"B. pertussis\", including filamentous hemaglutinin and pertactin, mediate attachment to the epithelium. The bacteria then multiply. In infants, who experience more severe disease, the bacteria spread down to the lungs.\n\nThe bacteria secrete a number of toxins. Tracheal cytotoxin, a fragment of peptidoglycan, kills ciliated epithelial cells and thereby inhibits the mucociliary elevator by which mucus and debris are removed. TCT may contribute to the cough characteristic of pertussis. The cough may also be caused by a yet-to-be identified \"cough toxin\". Pertussis toxin causes lymphocytosis by an unknown mechanism. The elevated number of white blood cells leads to pulmonary hypertension, a major cause of death by pertussis. In infants who develop encephalopathy, cerebral hemorrhage and cortical atrophy occur, likely due to hypoxia.\n\nA physician's overall impression is most effective in initially making the diagnosis. Single factors are much less useful.\n\nMethods used in laboratory diagnosis include culturing of nasopharyngeal swabs on a nutrient medium (Bordet-Gengou medium), polymerase chain reaction (PCR), direct fluorescent antibody (DFA), and serological methods (e.g. complement fixation test). The bacteria can be recovered from the person only during the first three weeks of illness, rendering culturing and DFA useless after this period, although PCR may have some limited usefulness for an additional three weeks.\n\nSerology may be used for adults and adolescents who have already been infected for several weeks to determine whether antibody against pertussis toxin or another virulence factor of \"B. pertussis\" is present at high levels in the blood of the person.\n\nA similar, milder disease is caused by \"B. parapertussis\".\n\nThe primary method of prevention for pertussis is vaccination. Evidence is insufficient to determine the effectiveness of antibiotics in those who have been exposed, but are without symptoms. Preventive antibiotics, however, are still frequently used in those who have been exposed and are at high risk of severe disease (such as infants).\n\nPertussis vaccines are effective at preventing illness and are recommended for routine use by the World Health Organization and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The vaccine saved an estimated half a million lives in 2002.\n\nThe multicomponent acellular pertussis vaccine is 71‚Äì85% effective, with greater effectiveness for more severe strains. Despite widespread vaccination, however, pertussis has persisted in vaccinated populations and is today \"one of the most common vaccine-preventable diseases in Western countries\". The 21st-century resurgences in pertussis infections are attributed to a combination of waning immunity and bacterial mutations that elude vaccines.\n\nImmunization does not confer lifelong immunity; a 2011 CDC study indicated that protection may only last three to six years. This covers childhood, which is the time of greatest exposure and greatest risk of death from pertussis.\n\nAn effect of widespread immunization on society has been the shift of reported infections from children aged 1‚Äì9 years to infants, adolescents, and adults, with adolescents and adults acting as reservoirs for \"B. pertussis\" and infecting infants who have had fewer than three doses of vaccine.\n\nInfection induces incomplete natural immunity that wanes over time. A 2005 study said estimates of the duration of infection-acquired immunity range from 7 to 20 years and the different results could be the result of differences in levels of circulating \"B. pertussis\", surveillance systems, and case definitions used. The study said protective immunity after vaccination wanes after 4‚Äì12 years. One study suggested that the availability of vaccine exemptions increases the number of pertussis cases.\n\nSome studies have suggested that while acellular pertussis vaccines are effective preventing the disease, they have a limited impact on infection and transmission, meaning that vaccinated people could spread the pertussis even though they may have only mild symptoms or none at all.\n\nThe antibiotics erythromycin, clarithromycin, or azithromycin are typically the recommended treatment. Newer macrolides are frequently recommended due to lower rates of side effects. Trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TMP/SMX) may be used in those with allergies to first-line agents or in infants who have a risk of pyloric stenosis from macrolides.\n\nA reasonable guideline is to treat people age >1 year within 3 weeks of cough onset and infants age <1 year and pregnant women within 6 weeks of cough onset. If the person is diagnosed late, antibiotics will not alter the course of the illness, and even without antibiotics, they should no longer be spreading pertussis. When used early, antibiotics decrease the duration of infectiousness, and thus prevent spread. Short-term antibiotics (azithromycin for 3‚Äì5 days) are as effective as long-term treatment (erythromycin 10‚Äì14 days) in eliminating \"B. pertussis\" with fewer and less severe side effects.\n\nPeople with pertussis are infectious from the beginning of the catarrhal stage (a runny nose, sneezing, low-grade fever, symptoms of the common cold) through the third week after the onset of paroxysms (multiple, rapid coughs) or until 5 days after the start of effective antimicrobial treatment.\nEffective treatments of the cough associated with this condition have not been developed.\n\nWhile most healthy older children and adults fully recover, infection in newborns is particularly severe. Pertussis is fatal in an estimated 0.5% of US infants under one year of age. First-year infants are also more likely to develop complications, such as: apneas (31%), pneumonia (12%), seizures (0.6%) and encephalopathy (0.15%). This may be due to the ability of the bacterium to suppress the immune system.\n\nWorldwide, whooping cough affects around 16 million people yearly. One estimate for 2013 stated it resulted in about 61,000 deaths ‚Äì down from 138,000 deaths in 1990. Another estimated 195,000 child deaths yearly from the disease worldwide. This is despite generally high coverage with the DTP and DTaP vaccines. Pertussis is one of the leading causes of vaccine-preventable deaths worldwide. About 90% of all cases occur in developing countries.\n\nBefore vaccines, an average of 178,171 cases was reported in the U.S., with peaks reported every two to five years; more than 93% of reported cases occurred in children under 10 years of age. The actual incidence was likely much higher. After vaccinations were introduced in the 1940s, pertussis incidence fell dramatically to approximately 1,000 by 1976. Incidence rates have increased since 1980. In 2015, rates in the United States were 20,762 people.\n\nPertussis is the only vaccine-preventable disease that is associated with increasing deaths in the U.S. The number of deaths increased from four in 1996 to 17 in 2001, almost all of which were infants under one year. In Canada, the number of pertussis infections has varied between 2,000 and 10,000 reported cases each year over the last ten years, and it is the most common vaccine-preventable illness in Toronto.\n\nIn 2009 Australia reported an average of 10,000 cases a year, and the number of cases had increased. In the U.S. pertussis in adults has increased significantly since about 2004.\n\nIn 2010 ten infants in California died, and health authorities declared an epidemic encompassing 9,120 cases. They found that doctors had failed to correctly diagnose the infants' condition during several visits. Statistical analysis identified significant overlap in communities with a cluster of nonmedical child exemptions and cases. The number of exemptions varied widely among communities, but tended to be highly clustered. In some schools, more than three-fourths of parents filed for vaccination exemptions. The data suggest vaccine refusal based on nonmedical reasons and personal belief exacerbated the outbreak. Other factors included reduced duration of immunity following the acellular vaccine and, the fact that most vaccinated adults and older children had not received a booster shot.\n\nIn April and May 2012 pertussis was declared to be at epidemic levels in Washington, with 3,308 cases. In December 2012 Vermont declared an epidemic of 522 cases. Wisconsin had the highest incidence rate, with 3,877 cases, although it did not make an official epidemic declaration.\n\n\"B. pertussis\" was discovered in 1906 by Jules Bordet and Octave Gengou, who also developed the first serology and vaccine. Efforts to develop an inactivated whole-cell vaccine began soon after \"B. pertussis\" was cultured that year. In the 1920s, Louis W. Sauer developed a weak vaccine for whooping cough at Evanston Hospital (Evanston, IL). In 1925 Danish physician Thorvald Madsen was the first to test a whole-cell vaccine on a wide scale. Madsen used the vaccine to control outbreaks in the Faroe Islands in the North Sea.\n\nIn 1932 an outbreak of whooping cough hit Atlanta, Georgia, prompting pediatrician Leila Denmark to begin her study of the disease. Over the next six years her work was published in the \"Journal of the American Medical Association\", and in partnership with Emory University and Eli Lilly & Company, she developed the first pertussis vaccine. In 1942 American scientists Grace Eldering, Loney Gordon, and Pearl Kendrick combined the whole-cell pertussis vaccine with diphtheria and tetanus toxoids to generate the first DTP combination vaccine. To minimize the frequent side effects caused by the pertussis component, Japanese scientist Yuji Sato developed an acellular vaccine consisting of purified haemagglutinins (HAs: filamentous strep throat and leukocytosis-promoting-factor HA), which are secreted by \"B. pertussis\". Sato's acellular pertussis vaccine was used in Japan starting in 1981. Later versions of the acellular vaccine in other countries consisted of additional defined components of \"B. pertussis\" and were often part of the DTaP combination vaccine.\n\n"}
