The event was part of the greater Russian famine of 1921–22 that affected other parts of the USSR, in which up 5,000,000 people died in total. According to Roman Serbyn, a professor of Russian and East European history, the Tatarstan famine was the first man-made famine in the Soviet Union and systematically targeted ethnic minorities such as Volga Tatars and Volga Germans.\n\nSoviet leadership had long sought to suppress Tatar nationalism in the USSR. Tatars were frequently charged with \"bourgeois nationalism\" and other revisionist crimes. Tatar leadership was executed or imprisoned, which many fled the USSR to Turkey for refuge. Collectivization of Tatar agriculture began in 1921. According to historian James Minahan, Crimean Tatars in particular \"suffered proportionally greater population losses than any other Soviet national group during the first decades of Soviet rule.\" Farming methods in the Tatar ASSR were outdated, similar to most non-Russian nationalities in the Soviet Union. In addition, very few indigenous Tatar proletariat existed due to Russian imperial dominance.\n\nIn early spring of 1921, the Cheka reported massive protests and riots among peasants. By 23 March, reports began to describe the developments in some kantons as a \"famine\" and documented peasants starving to death and committing suicide. In response to the lack of food, many peasants prevented grain trucks from leaving Tatarstan and some refused to sow their fields. The famine also saw a large rise in the number of children submitted to orphanages, with poorer parents leaving their children in state institutions and some just abandoning them on the streets to fend for themselves. Orphanages could not keep up with demand, and the Tatar ASSR government devoted resources to expand the number of institutions available. For example, the Sviyazhsk kanton had two orphanages, which kept 64 children in July 1920. By, January 1922, this had expanded to 12 orphanages with 704 children.\n\nBy March 1922, some villages had lost half their population. The famine also led to a sharp decline in the number of livestock and farming equipment as starving peasants sold off their property or slaughtered the draft animals for food. KGB records from the time note the deaths of at least 500,000 people in Tatarstan, but more recent estimates conclude the actual value was much higher at 2,000,000. Historian James Long approximates that roughly 13% of the Tatar ASSR population fled to other parts of the country while another 10% died. This famine is also known as \"terror-famine\" and \"famine-genocide\" in Tatarstan.\n\nIn the summer of 1922, the special committee \"Tatpomgol\" was established to cope with the famine. By August 1922, \"Tatpomgol\" imported 8 million pood (Russian pounds) of food, including 2 million pounds of seed, with a loan. From the affected regions, hundreds of thousands of people, mostly children, were evacuated to Central Asia, Belarus and Siberia. Emergency feeding points were established throughout the republic. The Soviet government invited international organizations, such as Workers International Relief to assist. The United States government provided aid to starving Tatars in from 1920 to 1923 through the American Relief Administration.\n\nThough the most hard-hitting phase of the famine ended in 1922, shortages, starvation, and illness continued in the Volga region throughout 1923 and into 1924, and the Soviet government settled ethnic Russians into the Tatar ASSR and in Idel-Ural region in this time causing the Tatars' share of the population to eventually decline to less than 50%. \n\nIn 2008, the All-Russian Tatar Social Center (VTOTs) asked the United Nations to condemn the 1921–22 Tatarstan famine as genocide of Muslim Tatars.\n\n\n"}

The BSDS arose from Pies's experience as a psychopharmacology consultant, where he was frequently called on to manage cases of \"treatment-resistant depression\".\n\nTheir English version of the scale consists of 19 question items and two sections. It differs from most scales in that it does not list separate items, but rather presents a short paragraph talking about experiences that people with bipolar spectrum disorders often have. The person checks off which phrases or experiences fit them. \n\nThe scale was validated in its original version and demonstrated high diagnostic sensitivity, meaning that most people with confirmed bipolar diagnoses scored high on the BSDS. The BSDS may do better than other scales at detecting types of bipolar disorder that do not involve a full manic episode, such as bipolar II or cyclothymic disorder. \n\n"}

Policies were focused on prohibition and criminalisation, rather than more liberal policies such as harm reduction and the rehabilitation of users and addicts.\n\nLegislation against drugs first appeared in post-revolutionary Russia, in Article 104-d of the 1922 Penal Code of the RSFSR, criminalising drug production, trafficking, and possession with intent to traffic. The 1924 Soviet Constitution expanded this legislation to cover the whole Soviet Union. The 1926 Penal Code of the RSFSR suggested imprisonment or corrective labour for between one and three years as punishment for these offences, depending on the scale of the offence committed. It is noteworthy that drug possession without intention to traffic and the personal use of drugs warranted no penalties at this time.\n\nDrug regulation remained largely untouched in the Soviet Union until 1974, when the Supreme Soviet issued a Decree entitled 'On Reinforcement of the Fight Against Drug Addiction'. This Decree was reproduced in Article 224 of the Penal Codes of all the Republics of the USSR, and not only increased the penalties for the offences mentioned above to between ten and fifteen years' imprisonment, but for the first time criminalised possession of drugs without intent to traffic, bringing a penalty of up to three years in prison. Additional offences of 'seducing another person to narcotic drugs', punishable by up to five years' imprisonment, and the theft of narcotics, punishable by between five and fifteen years' imprisonment, were also created. The term 'narcotics' used here referred to all drugs listed by UN Conventions, not just opiates.\n\nA further decree issued in 1987 made a conviction for the above offences within a year of an earlier conviction for the same violation of the law liable to punishment of up to two years' imprisonment or corrective labor. Sergei Lebedev, the Chairman of the Association of Independent Advocates in Leningrad at the time, argued that the steady escalation of criminal penalties for drug use was \"indicative of the Soviet authorities’ resignation to their complete inability to solve drug problems in a constructive and humane way\".\n\nTreatment was performed in various different ways depending on the substance the patient was addicted to. A physician would usually administer their drug of choice in small doses for maintenance. This was done to prevent the patient from experiencing withdrawal symptoms.\n\n\n"}

The procedure is used for breeding programs and research purposes in various species, as well as in the treatment of an ejaculatory dysfunction in human males.\n\nIn humans, electroejaculation is usually carried out under a general anesthetic. An electric probe is inserted into the rectum adjacent to the prostate gland. The probe delivers an AC voltage, usually 12–24 volts sine wave at a frequency of 60 Hz, with a current limited to usually 500 mA, although some devices can generate currents of up to 1 A. The probe is activated for 1–2 seconds, referred to as a stimulus cycle. Ejaculation usually occurs after 2–3 stimulus cycles. Care must be taken when using currents greater than 500 mA, as tissue burns may result due to heating of the probe. The stimulus voltage stimulates nearby nerves, resulting in contraction of the pelvic muscles and ejaculation. This procedure is used frequently with large mammals, particularly bulls and some domestic animals, as well as humans who have certain types of anejaculation. Electroejaculation has also been used for cryoconservation of animal genetic resources where one would collect semen and stored in low temperatures with the intent of conserving genetic material and future revival.\n\nIn the practice of veterinary medicine and animal science, it is common to collect semen from domestic ruminants using electro-ejaculation without sedation or anesthesia. Only in goats is mild sedation sometimes used. Because of the significant skeletal muscle contractions it causes, electroejaculation is not used in stallions — except in rare cases, under general anesthesia.\n\n\nThe procedure has been adopted and modified as an assisted reproduction technique for managing endangered species, to ensure the production of offspring from incompatible pairs of animals where artificial insemination is feasible.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "12683320", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=12683320", "title": "Employment and Support Allowance", "text": "Employment and Support Allowance\n\nEmployment and Support Allowance (ESA) is a United Kingdom welfare payment for adults younger than the State Pension age who are having difficulty finding work because of their long-term medical condition or a disability. It is a basic income-replacement benefit paid in lieu of wages.\n\nESA superseded three older benefits: Incapacity Benefit; Income Support paid because of an illness or disability; and Severe Disablement Allowance. New Labour legislated for ESA at the very end of the Blair era and it became the main out-of-work sickness benefit for new claims during the financial crisis of 2007-2008. The Conservative-Liberal Democrat coalition was quick to extend its scope: ministers gave the go-ahead for a compulsory reassessment of all long-term recipients of ESA’s predecessors and the transfer of those confirmed as unfit for work onto ESA.\n\nOne key feature of ESA is \"conditionality\": some recipients must take part in \"work-related activity\" in exchange for their payments. A second key feature is that recipients are liable to be repeatedly probed by a government-approved nurse about their state of health — a reflection of a policy belief that most conditions will improve over time, either spontaneously or as a result of medical intervention.\n\nESA is received by more than two million people. It has not achieved its aim — despite tougher eligibility criteria, \"conditionality\", and multiple medicals for established recipients — of reducing the sickness benefit caseload by one million by 2018.\n\nThe Coalition’s long-serving Welfare Secretary, Iain Duncan Smith, eventually concluded that ESA was “fundamentally flawed”. One of his successors, Damian Green, added that it was “pointless” to repeatedly assess people with permanent disabilities. In 2016 the government published a Green Paper envisaging an overhaul of ESA - no specific action has been taken as a result.\n\nIn 2018, the Department for Work and Pensions (DWP) began to repay money to ESA recipients who had been inaccurately reassessed, in circumstances where the recipients had been required to stop claiming their old benefit - usually Incapacity Benefit - and make a completely new claim for ESA. The department's approved health professionals had controversially reassessed these claimants' long-term disability against the DWP's new medical criteria, but the DWP itself had not tried to reassess their financial situation: evidence of any deterioration was not sought by the department, so none was taken into account when calculating what type of ESA was appropriate, and the rate of payment.\n\nThe government plans to stop all ESA payments by 2023, if and when Universal Credit is fully rolled out.\n\nAn individual can put in a claim for ESA if they satisfy all of these conditions:\n\nThey will not be paid ESA if they are entitled to Statutory Sick Pay (this usually means \"if they have a job\", but there are exceptions) and it is not possible to receive ESA at the same time as the other main out-of-work benefits, i.e. Jobseekers Allowance, received by 440,000 people, or Income Support (given nowadays to 560,000 people, mainly lone parents). \n\nUniversal Credit, which is received by one million people nationally, can contain a component analogous to ESA.\n\nNo money is paid for the first week. After that, the basic allowance is paid to the claimant until their Work Capability Assessment (WCA) at - in theory - week 13, after which a successful claimant might receive an enhanced level of payment (depending on the level of disability and whether they enter the work-related activity group or the support group after their assessment).\n<nowiki>* Only one of these components is payable per claim\n</nowiki>\n\nIn April 2017, the work-related activity component was abolished for new claimants, even if they had ‘passed’ their WCA and been put in the work-related activity group; the same applies to successful reclaims, if more than a certain time has elapsed since the last period of receipt of ESA (long-term successful claimants who had a WCA before April 2017 continue to receive it). People receiving the support component are unaffected.\n\nAn enhanced disability premium of £15.90 a week may be paid to single people receiving the support component of income-related ESA; for a couple, the rate is £22.85 where one or both partners qualify.\n\nIn some circumstances, an additional severe disability premium of £62.45 a week may be paid.\n\nESA can be either \"contributory\" or \"income-related\". If claimants have paid enough National Insurance they can claim contributory ESA for up to one year if they get the \"work-related activity component\", or indefinitely if they get the \"support component\". Income-related ESA is for people who have not paid enough National Insurance and is subject to a means test and certain other conditions (although the amount paid as contributions-based ESA can also be affected by financial circumstances). Income-related ESA is not time-limited and is not usually subject to Income Tax, but contribution-based ESA is. If a spouse or partner is also receiving out-of-work benefits, this might affect entitlement.\n\nUniversal Credit is incorporating income-related ESA in stages. In the parts of the UK where it already has, contribution-based ESA has been rebadged as \"new-style ESA\".\n\nSomeone wanting to claim ESA will need a medical certificate, i.e. a sick-note, signed by their GP to say that they are not fully fit for work. The new claimant must then contact the Department for Work and Pensions (DWP), usually by phone, who will log their claim and usually post them an ESA50 questionnaire to complete (except in rare circumstances where a full assessment is not required, such as when a doctor has officially certified the claimant as being likely to die within six months). The completed form must then be sent in the envelope provided to the Health Assessment Advisory Service - the trading name of the assessment provider, Maximus.\n\nOnce a person has submitted a claim for ESA, they will normally be paid \"assessment rate\" ESA at the basic rate given above. At some point in this \"assessment phase\" a Work Capability Assessment will normally be carried out to determine whether the claimant: a) meets the criteria for receiving ESA long-term, or b) does not, in fact, qualify for ESA at all.\n\nFirst, the ESA50 form, together with any other information sent with it by the claimant, will be read by a qualified healthcare professional, who will then decide on whether a face-to-face medical assessment is actually necessary: some people with severe disabilities can be granted ESA based solely on the documents supplied, if that is clear from the paperwork. For this reason, Maximus encourages new claimants to send as much relevant information as possible and give a detailed description of their disability when filling in the claim form.\n\nAlthough the DWP says it tries to make the claims process as straightforward as possible, the process of claiming can nevertheless be stressful for claimants (see Criticism of the Work Capability Assessment). Many complain that their mental health deteriorated as a result of claiming.\n\nThe Department for Work and Pensions (DWP) contracted Atos to perform the core medical assessment, the Work Capability Assessment (WCA), when it introduced ESA. Maximus took over the contract - worth £170million a year to the US firm - from Atos in March 2015. The WCA's performance in 2010, 2011 and 2012 was reviewed by Professor Malcolm Harrington and in 2013 and 2014 by Dr Paul Litchfield.\n\nThe assessment is often described as consisting of two separate assessments. In practice, if they have a face-to-face assessment, an individual claimant will experience only one assessment on the day (the decision-making is done afterwards). The two stages are:\n\nA DWP official makes the final decision on entitlement, based on all the available evidence.\nESA is often loosely but inaccurately described as being for people who are \"unfit for work\", while the official term \"limited capability for work\" is not clear in its meaning. In fact, people on ESA can and do take suitable jobs when the opportunity arises, without their impairment necessarily having improved - on paper, relatively few people receiving ESA are incapable of any work whatsoever.\n\nThere are two groups of successful ESA claimants: the Work-Related Activity Group and the Support Group. People in the Support Group tend to have the more severe impairments, they are classed as having both \"limited capability for work\" and “limited capability for work-related activity” and they are not required to prepare for work. The Work-Related Activity Group contains people who also have \"limited capability for work\" but who do not have “limited capability for work-related activity”; they \"are\" required to participate in pre-employment coaching because they are considered by the DWP to be \"likely\" to work \"in the future\" - specifically, within two years.\n\nAt their WCA, an ESA claimant \"must\" be found to have \"limited capability for work\" in order to qualify at all. The testing process gauges the claimant’s ability to perform up to 17 activities; these activities are set out on the ESA claim form. For each activity, a claimant can score 15, 9, 6 or 0 points: the more severe their disability, the more points they will score. Points are scored by having physical impairments, mental ones or a mixture of the two (if they are likely to significantly affect the claimant's ability to work). In order to be entitled to ESA, a person will need to score at least 15 points in total.\n\nOther factors, such as some aspects of pregnancy, are also considered by the assessor, who will be a nurse, doctor, occupational therapist or physiotherapist; these factors do not operate on a points system but \"might\" nevertheless qualify the claimant for ESA.\n\nThis is, in theory, about whether a successful claimant of ESA is capable of taking part in interviews and pre-employment training, or whether their ability to do so is limited to a significant degree. As far as the way the WCA actually operates is concerned, this is about whether the claimant has one or more severe disabilities, affecting mobilising, manual dexterity, etc.\n\nSuccess at this stage usually qualifies the claimant for the Support Group.\n\nIn May 1997, Frank Field was made Minister for Welfare Reform. He approved of the principle of self-help through mutual organisations such as friendly societies, he thought the state should have only a small role to play in the provision of welfare, and he disliked means-testing and non-contributory entitlement. These ideas were out of step with those of the new Chancellor, Gordon Brown, in particular, and Field's ministerial tenure was short-lived.\n\nA Green Paper published in 1998 foreshadowed New Labour's approach to out-of-work benefit reform from that point on: being in work was vital and the government would encourage people on benefits to find jobs, using the carrot and the stick; the claimant's contribution would be to try to find work; and Incapacity Benefit would be partially means-tested, with people receiving an occupational pension incurring a deduction in the amount of Incapacity Benefit they would receive.\n\nIn 2001, on the first full day of New Labour's second term in office, the Department of Social Security was amalgamated with the Department for Employment to form the Department for Work and Pensions (DWP). The new department set to work overhauling the eligibility test for sickness benefits and vastly expanding its scope.\n\nA new benefit was envisaged that would \"accentuate the positive\" rather than lead recipients with moderate disabilities to feel that they were permanently incapacitated. However, policymakers acknowledged that some people really \"were\" incapable of all work so they needed a new medical test, one that would do more than just give a \"yes or no\" answer to the question of sickness benefit entitlement. The new test would need to do \"three\" things:\n\n\nThe belief in the DWP was that the new approach would not just \"cap\" the total number of people on sickness benefits, as Incapacity Benefit was supposed to have done, but \"actively reduce it\" to a small group of people with severe disabilities and another modestly-sized group who were undergoing fixed-term pre-employment training.\n\nThe new policy was expected to achieve its objective in four ways:\n\nWhile the new sickness benefit was still at the planning stage, the total caseload peaked in 2004. Since then, the background trend has been gradually \"downwards\".\n\nThe main reason for this change in trajectory was demographic: in particular, World War Two \"baby boomers\" on sickness benefits had begun to draw their State Pension instead. Other specific reasons were: men suffering from industrial diseases, such as asbestosis and silicosis, caused by working in mines, shipyards and other hazardous environments, were dying prematurely; eligibility criteria had become stricter since 1995; and the economy had improved and was creating more jobs.\n\nIn February 2005, as another general election loomed, the BBC analysed New Labour's record on welfare reform:\nOn the same day, the Welfare Secretary Alan Johnson announced plans to replace Incapacity Benefit with two new benefits: \"Disability and Sickness Allowance\", for people deemed too ill to work; and \"Rehabilitation Support Allowance\", paid at the same rate as Jobseekers Allowance to less disabled people, who would be \"supported\" by the DWP back into work. In reality, no benefits with these names ever materialised, and the policy behind \"Rehabilitation Support Allowance\" was still being debated more than a decade later.\n\nIn March 2005, there was a sign of action on the ground: Atos was awarded the contract to work with the DWP to build the software programme that would be used in the assessment of claims for the allowance that would take the place of Incapacity Benefit. The firm, which was already carrying out the DWP's existing disability assessments, would employ hundreds more healthcare professionals to carry out the new test once it went live - in late 2008.\n\nThis term of office was notable for the high turnover of Welfare Secretaries:\n\n\nIn January 2006, John Hutton published a White Paper outlining the government's latest plans for welfare reform: the benefit that would replace Incapacity Benefit would be called Employment and Support Allowance and its \"gateway\" assessment would be transformed. Over the course of a decade, Hutton expected the number of people on Incapacity Benefit to fall by one million, thereby saving £7billion a year.\n\nThe resulting Welfare Reform Bill was introduced to Parliament for consideration in July 2006. On 3 May 2007, the bill received royal assent and a week later Tony Blair announced his decision to leave Downing Street.\n\nBlair appointed David Freud, a former vice-chairman of investment banking at UBS, as an advisor on out-of-work benefit reform in December 2006. Freud's 2007 report - dubbed \"the Freud report\" but officially titled \"Reducing dependency, increasing opportunity: options for the future of welfare to work\" - called for the greater use of private sector companies who would be paid by results, for substantial resources to be made available to help people on Incapacity Benefit back into work, and for a single working age benefit payment to replace Housing Benefit, Jobseekers Allowance, etc. His central thesis was that spending on \"delivery\" - such as schemes to get people back to work - would save money in the long run because there would be fewer people being paid money in the form of benefits. The DWP coined the term Invest to Save to describe this idea and referred to it in-house as \"the AME-DEL switch\".\n\nIn July 2008 a Green Paper was published, which James Purnell said was \"inspired by the reforms proposed by David Freud\". It declared that \"between 2009 and 2013, all Incapacity Benefit claimants will be reassessed using a medical assessment called the Work Capability Assessment\" that would divide them into three groups: fit for work; unfit for work but fit for \"work-related activity\"; or fit for neither. In the same month, Professor Paul Gregg was asked by the DWP to conduct a feasibility study of \"conditionality\" - a compulsory \"quid pro quo\" - as it might be applied to sickness benefit claimants. When responding to the Gregg Review, the DWP said that the study had recommended that conditionality be applied to \"the vast majority of people in receipt of Employment and Support Allowance\".\n\nIn October 2008, ESA and its eligibility test, the Work Capability Assessment, were introduced for new claims. Reformers were disappointed to find that the total number of people on sickness and incapacity benefits went \"up\", largely as a result of the financial crisis of 2008 and the consequent rise in background unemployment.\n\nPlans were made to tighten up the eligibility criteria still further - something that would set the Incapacity Benefit reassessment programme back by two years. The Welfare Secretary wrote that these and other planned changes would ensure that \"only those who are genuinely incapable of work\" would get full ESA - other sickness benefit recipients would have to comply with plans drawn up with the DWP's private partners to get them back to work.\n\nThe Labour Party manifesto, drafted by Ed Miliband and published before the general election in 2010, declared that if Labour won:\nIn early 2011, the Incapacity Benefit reassessment programme got underway using a more stringent version of the WCA and the caseload's falling trend resumed - until the middle of 2013, when the caseload began to grow again after fresh guidance had to be issued on how to judge fitness for work.\n\nBy 2015, the picture was clear: in the absence of the huge fall in recipients prophesied by the architects of ESA, and in spite of the broadly downward natural long-term trend, the total caseload was little different from when ESA was introduced.\n\nAs a reflection of this failure of ESA to achieve its goal of shifting large numbers of people off benefits and into work, the cost to the Exchequer of out-of-work sickness benefits \"did not fall at all\" after ESA was introduced: the annual cost is now predicted to \"rise\" to £14 billion or more in the course of 2016, largely because more people than anticipated have gone into the Support Group - particularly since the second half of 2013.\n\nRoughly 70,000 claimants were paid between £5,000 and £20,000 too little from 2011 to 2016 because the DWP did not ensure they got their correct entitlement when they were moved from incapacity benefit on to employment and support allowance. A Public Accounts Committee report accused the DWP of haste over the transfer while failing to take legal advice or make basic checks. Evidence that people were underpaid was disregarded and warnings from its own policy advisors that it should delay and sort out the issues before proceeding were ignored. The report said the DWP’s lack of urgency - it took six years to start to deal with the error - showed “a culture of indifference” to people being paid too little. Meg Hillier said the affair demonstrated “weakness at the highest levels” of the DWP. “Thousands of people have not received money essential for living costs because of government’s blinkered and wholly inept handling of ESA” she said.\n\nIn January 2016, the Conservative Welfare Secretary, Iain Duncan Smith, announced that ESA was \"fundamentally flawed\" and declared that a brand new policy, which would get nearly all ESA recipients back to work, would be unveiled within weeks. A hint of what that policy might be was given in a detailed report on ESA published the following month by Reform, the right-of-centre think-tank:\n\n\nIn March 2016, Duncan Smith unexpectedly resigned after a clash with the Chancellor of the Exchequer, George Osborne. In his resignation letter, \"IDS\" complained that there was \"not enough awareness from the Treasury, in particular, that the Government's vision of a new welfare-to-work system could not be repeatedly salami-sliced\". Duncan Smith's replacement, Stephen Crabb, declared that there would be no new welfare policies, other than those set out in the Conservative Party manifesto of 2015, in that parliamentary term - thereby scotching IDS's plan.\n\nIn October 2016, Damian Green announced a consultation exercise on reforming the WCA. Two years on, no concrete action has been taken as a result by the DWP.\n"}

{"id": "19222449", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=19222449", "title": "HIV/AIDS in Peru", "text": "HIV/AIDS in Peru\n\nCases of HIV/AIDS in Peru are considered to have reached the level of a concentrated epidemic. According to a population-based survey conducted in Peru’s 24 largest cities in 2002, adult HIV prevalence was estimated to be less than 1 percent (0.6 percent among pregnant women; 0.4 percent among males; and 0.1 percent among females). The survey demonstrated that cases are unevenly distributed in the country, affecting mostly young people between the ages of 25 and 34. As of July 2010, the cumulative reported number of persons infected with HIV was 41,638, and there were 26,566 cases of AIDS, according to the Ministry of Health (MOH), and the male/female ratio for AIDS diagnoses in 2009 was 3.02 to 1. The Joint United Nations Program on HIV/AIDS (UNAIDS) estimates 76,000 Peruvians are HIV-positive, meaning that many people at risk do not know their status. There were 3,300 deaths due to AIDS in Peru in 2007 (UNAIDS, 2008), down from 5,600 deaths in 2005.\n\nAmong Peru’s reported cases of HIV/AIDS, 77 percent are in Lima and Callao – the capital city area (United Nations General Assembly Special Session report, 2010). Sexual transmission accounts for the majority (97 percent) of cases, followed by mother-to-child transmission (2 percent), and contaminated blood and blood products (1 percent) (UNGASS, 2010). The prevalence among men who have sex with men (MSM), which was 14 percent nationally and 23 percent in Lima in 2005, has continued to rise in recent years, while among sex workers prevalence remains low (0.6 to 2 percent). In five Central American countries, the annual HIV incidence was 5.1% among men who have sex with men, while an incidence of 3.5% has been found among men who have sex with men who attended public health clinics in Lima, Peru. A recent analysis by Alarcon-Villaverde indicated MSM account for a large proportion of HIV incidence (55 percent) in Peru (UNAIDS, 2009). In addition, transsexuals who are sex workers are the most affected population, with an estimated prevalence between 32 percent and 45 percent (UNGASS, 2010). Although 96 percent of female sex workers (FSWs) report having used a condom with their last client (MOH, 2003), the frequency of condom use among male sex workers is only 42 percent (UNGASS 2008). HIV/AIDS incidence in the main prisons in Peru is approximately 1.1 percent (Instituto Nacional Penitenciario [INPE], 2005), and condom use by prison inmates is low (32.8 percent reported in 2004) (INPE, 2005).\n\nBlood safety is also a concern. Several reported cases of HIV infection in 2006 and 2007 have been attributed to blood transfusions received through public health services (MOH, 2007).\n\nInfections with syphilis, gonorrhea, and Chlamydia in men and women and trichomoniasis and bacterial vaginosis in women are factors in the increasing risk of HIV transmission in Peru. According to the 2009 Demographic and Health Survey, 14 percent of the women surveyed among those reporting history of sexual intercourse reported having sexually transmitted infection (STI) symptoms. Inadequate and ineffective treatment of STIs is common in Peru. Inadequate and ineffective treatment of sexually transmitted infections (STIs) is common. Also of significant concern is the high HIV prevalence among prison inmates. Given the relatively low level of sexual education, limited condom use, and risky sexual behaviors practiced by some subpopulations, including multiple sex partners, there is a significant potential for the further spread of HIV in Peru. According to the 2008 UNGASS report, less than 5 percent of schools offer sex education, including information about HIV (USAID 2010). One study by Klausner and Mendoza (2002) of young people aged 18 to 30 in 34 neighborhoods in Lima, Chiclayo, and Trujillo demonstrated that 18 percent had more than one sex partner in the last year, 8 percent had more than one partner in the last three months, and condom use was low.\n\nPeru was one of the first countries in Latin America to adopt a syndromic management approach to STIs and offer prophylaxis for preventing mother-to-child HIV transmission, although currently PMTCT coverage is only 56 percent, according to the 2010 UNGASS report. Peru’s strategy to prevent STIs was called a model for the Andean region, and in 2000, UNAIDS cited Peru’s HIV/AIDS prevention program as one of the best in the world. Soon after, however, political turmoil, an economic crisis, and repeated changes in key personnel combined to undermine MOH operations, including the STI program. In a major restructuring of the MOH in 2002 and 2003, several vertical programs, including the National AIDS Program (NAP), were merged. This was accompanied by a reduction in funding and management capacity for AIDS, tuberculosis (TB), child immunization, and other programs. All aspects of the NAP suffered. In 2004, the MOH began reconstituting its HIV/AIDS program, with the goals of limiting the expansion of the epidemic by preventing new infections and providing appropriate and effective care and support to those who have HIV/AIDS.\n\nIn 2007, a new Strategic Multisectoral Plan for the Prevention and Control of STI/HIV/AIDS for 2007–2011 was designed based on evidence-based strategies. Most-at-risk populations (MARPs) were included as one of the most important target populations. The Plan proposed nine strategic objectives, including prevention, care, and policy issues. One strategic objective was the reduction of HIV and STIs among MSM, FSW, and prison inmates. The Plan proposed the following activities: promotion and distribution of condoms, advocacy for promotion and access to services, improvement of STI/HIV services, STI/HIV facilities, treatment of STIs, strengthening the peer-educator strategy, and strengthening community-based organizations of MSM and FSW. Since the plan was designed to guide HIV/STI activities for 2007–2011, Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria projects in Peru (especially the sixth round) used it as a framework for their activities.\n\nPublic health services are the main source of care for HIV/AIDS and STIs in Peru, most of which are delivered by the MOH, regional health authorities, and the social security system. In coordination with the MOH, other state sectors, such as the Ministry of Education and the Ministry for Women and Social Development, have programs directed at educating and protecting adolescents and children and preventing HIV/AIDS by promoting healthy lifestyles and reducing high-risk behaviors. Education efforts for HIV prevention in schools are being implemented as part of activities financed by the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria and the United States Agency for International Development (USAID).\n\nPeruvians living with HIV/AIDS are protected by Law 26626, enacted in 1996, which recognizes fundamental rights of autonomy, confidentiality, and nondiscrimination and guarantees provision of medical treatment according to the state’s capacity. HIV testing for pregnant women is mandatory where there is a risk (although this is criticized by human rights observers), and the state is required to provide integral care (including treatment) to all people living with HIV/AIDS (PLWHA). According to the WHO/UNAIDS/UNICEF Towards Universal Access report, only 48 percent of HIV-infected people in need of antiretroviral therapy (ART) were receiving it in 2007.\n\nThe activities supported by the Global Fund represent a large proportion of the investment in HIV/AIDS in the country, though the Government of Peru is funding most of the costs of procuring antiretroviral drugs. Peru has obtained funding for HIV/AIDS activities through the Global Fund's rounds two, five, and six. The initial activities emphasized the provision of highly active antiretroviral therapy (ART), but later projects emphasized prevention. Peru directs more than 5% of its HIV prevention spending toward prevention programmes for men who have sex with men. An opportunity in these prevention efforts is to target HIV positive individuals through internet communication and cell phone messages to support intervention delivery for HIV treatment adherence and prevention of secondary HIV transmission.\n\nThe Country Coordinating Mechanism (CCM), established for coordinating activities supported by the Global Fund, is the only multisectoral coordinating mechanism in the country. Under the CCM, governmental ministries, organizations of PLWHA and those affected by TB, nongovernmental organizations, faith-based groups, academia, and international organizations oversee and coordinate Peru’s response to the epidemic. The CCM steered the development of the Strategic Multisectoral Plan for the Prevention and Control of STI/HIV/AIDS for 2007-2011.\n\nThere are currently four national organizations of people living with HIV/AIDS in Peru. The group with the largest reported impact of 1,000 people is the Asociación Solas y Unidas, which was founded in 1999. Their principal activities include sexual and reproductive health training, gender and leadership for women living with HIV/AIDS, professional training and career support for impoverished women living with HIV/AIDS, education and training for children affected by HIV/AIDS, and nutritional support for low-income families affected by HIV/AIDS (Directory of Associations of People Living with HIV/AIDS, USAID 2004). Also working with these populations are the Alianza en Accion +, Coordinadora Peruana de Personas Viviendo con VIH/SIDA, and GAM Renacer. Overall, the populations these organizations work with have limited access to anti-retroviral therapies, psychosocial support, home-based services, while there is more access to nutritional guidance and TB screening and treatment through the national Ministry of Health health centers.\n\nThrough USAID, Peru received $1.2 million in fiscal year (FY) 2009 for essential HIV/AIDS programs and services. USAID’s HIV/AIDS programs in Peru are implemented as part of the U.S. President’s Emergency Plan. Thanks to this support, Peru’s health indicators-such as life expectancy, fertility rate, and infant and maternal death rates- have improved steadily over the past several decades. However, troubling differences exist, particularly between rural and urban populations, made worse by poverty and low education levels. Also, there remain to be significant challenges associated with enacting successful prevention efforts in Peru, in particular in the rural regions where there is limited access and where some communities do not even have a word for ‘prevention’.\n\n"}
{"id": "13796609", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=13796609", "title": "Healthcare in China", "text": "Healthcare in China\n\nHealthcare in China consists of both public and private medical institutions and insurance programs. About 95% of the population has at least basic health insurance coverage. Despite this, public health insurance generally only covers about half of medical costs, with the proportion lower for serious or chronic illnesses. Under the \"Healthy China 2020\" initiative, China is currently undertaking an effort to cut healthcare costs, and the government requires that insurance will cover 70% of costs by the end of 2018. The Chinese government is working on providing affordable basic healthcare to all residents by 2020. \nChina has also become a major market for health-related multinational companies. Companies such as AstraZeneca, GlaxoSmithKline, Eli Lilly, and Merck entered the Chinese market and have experienced explosive growth. China has also become a growing hub for health care research and development. \n\nThe above applies to Mainland China. Special Administrative Regions of Hong Kong and Macau maintain their own separate universal healthcare systems.\n\nTraditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) has been practiced for years, and served as the basis for health care in China for much of its history. Western-inspired evidence-based medicine made its way to China beginning in the 19th Century. When the Communist Party took over in 1949, health care was nationalized, a national \"patriotic health campaign\" attempted to address basic health and hygiene education, and basic primary care was dispatched to rural areas through barefoot doctors and other state-sponsored programs. Urban health care was also streamlined. However, beginning with economic reforms in 1978, health standards in China began to diverge significantly between urban and rural areas, and also between coastal and interior provinces. Much of the health sector became privatized. As state-owned enterprises shut down and the vast majority of urban residents were no longer employed by the state, they also lost much of the social security and health benefits. As a result, the majority of urban residents paid almost all health costs out-of-pocket beginning in the 1990s, and most rural residents simply could not afford to pay for health care in urban hospitalities.\n\nSince 2006, China has been undertaking the most significant health care reforms since the Mao era. The government launched the New Rural Co-operative Medical Care System (NRCMCS) in 2005 in an overhaul of the healthcare system, particularly intended to make it more affordable for the rural poor. Under the NRCMCS, some 800 million rural residents gained basic, tiered medical coverage, with the central and provincial governments covering between 30-80% of regular medical expenses. Availability of medical insurance has increased in urban areas as well. By 2011 more than 95% of the total population of China had basic health insurance, though out-of-pocket costs and the quality of care varied significantly. The health infrastructure in Beijing, Shanghai, and other major cities were approaching developed-world standards, and are vastly superior compared to those operated in the rural interior.\n\nAll major cities have hospitals specializing in different fields, and are equipped with some modern facilities. Residents of urban areas are not provided with free healthcare, and must either pay for treatment or purchase health insurance. The quality of hospitals varies. The best medical care in China is available in foreign-run or joint venture Western-style medical facilities with international staff available in Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou, and a few other large cities. They are highly expensive; treatment there can often cost up to ten times more than a public hospital. Public hospitals and clinics are available in all Chinese cities. Their quality varies by location; the best treatment can usually be found in public city-level hospitals, followed by smaller district-level clinics. Many public hospitals in major cities have so-called V.I.P. wards or \"gaogan bingfang\". These feature reasonably up-to-date medical technology and skilled staff. Most V.I.P. wards also provide medical services to foreigners and have English-speaking doctors and nurses. V.I.P. wards typically charge higher prices than other hospital facilities, but are still often cheap by Western standards. In addition to medical facilities providing modern care, traditional Chinese medicine is also widely used, and there are Chinese medicine hospitals and treatment facilities located throughout the country. Dental care, cosmetic surgery, and other health-related services at Western standards are widely available in urban areas, though costs vary.\n\nHistorically, in rural areas, most healthcare was available in clinics providing rudimentary care, with poorly trained medical personnel and little medical equipment or medications, though certain rural areas had far higher-quality medical care than others. However, the quality of rural health services has improved dramatically since 2009. In an increasing trend, healthcare for residents of rural areas unable to travel long distances to reach an urban hospital is provided by family doctors who travel to the homes of patients, which is covered by the government.\n\nReform of the health delivery system in urban areas of China has prompted concerns about the demand and utilization of Community Health Services Centres (CHC); a recent study, however, found that insured patients are less likely to use private clinics and more likely to use CHC.\n\nDespite the introduction of western style medical facilities and the implementation of a National Essential Drug Policy, the PRC has several emerging public health problems, which include problems as a result of pollution, a progressing HIV-AIDS epidemic, hundreds of millions of cigarette smokers, and the increase in obesity among the population. The HIV epidemic, in addition to the usual routes of infection, was exacerbated in the past by unsanitary practices used in the collection of blood in rural areas. The problem with tobacco is complicated by the concentration of most cigarette sales in a government controlled monopoly. The government, dependent on tobacco revenue, seems hesitant in its response and may even encourage it as seen from government websites.\nHepatitis B infection is widespread in mainland China, with about 10% of the population contracting the disease. Some hepatitis researchers link hepatitis infections to a lower ratio of female births. If this link is confirmed, this would partially explain China's gender imbalance. A program initiated in 2002 will attempt over the next 5 years to vaccinate all newborns in mainland China.\n\nStrains of avian flu outbreaks in recent years among local poultry and birds, along with a number of its citizens, have caused great concern for China and other countries. While the virus is currently mainly animal-human transmissible (with only two well documented cases of human-human have been to the present known of to scientists), experts expect an avian flu pandemic that would affect the region should the virus morph to be human-human transmissible.\n\nA more recent outbreak is the pig-human transmission of the \"Streptococcus suis\" bacteria in 2005, which has led to 38 deaths in and around Sichuan province, an unusually high number. Although the bacteria exists in other pig rearing countries, the pig-human transmission has only been reported in China.\n\nAs of 2004, in more undeveloped areas it is advised to only drink bottled water as cholera, among other diseases, is spread through the water supply. As of 2012, food and water safety remains an issue.\n\nAnother major problem are the \"black ambulances\", or illegal, privately run, for-profit ambulance services. As there is a shortage of ambulances belonging to hospitals in major cities, many private businessmen are now operating fleets of unauthorized ambulances, often staffed by untrained personnel and with no medical equipment, and charging the patients. Despite a government crackdown, the number of private ambulances is growing.\n\nUnaffordable medications are another gaping hole in the Chinese safety net. This forces workers to save as much as possible in order to weather family medical emergencies, which acts to depress domestic consumption, leaving no alternative to the traditional unsustainable export and investment driven economic model.\n\nA cross-sectional study between 2003 and 2011 showed remarkable increases in health insurance coverage and inpatient reimbursement were accompanied by increased use and coverage. The increases in services use are particularly important in rural areas and at hospitals. Major advances have been made in achieving equal access to insurance coverage, inpatient reimbursement, and basic health services, most notably for hospital delivery, and use of outpatient and inpatient care.\n\nNowadays, with substantial urbanisation, attention on health care has been changed. Urbanisation offers opportunities for improvements in population health in China (such as access to improved health care and basic infrastructure) and substantial health risks including air pollution, occupational and traffic hazards, and the risks conferred by changing diets and activity. Communicable infections should also be re-focused on.\n\nIn 2005 China had about 1,938,000 physicians (1.5 per 1,000 persons) and about 3,074,000 hospital beds (2.4 per 1,000 persons).\nHealth expenditures on a purchasing power parity (PPP) basis were US$224 per capita in 2001, or 5.5 percent of gross domestic product (). Some 37.2 percent of public expenditures were devoted to health care in China in 2001. However, about 80 percent of the health and medical care services are concentrated in cities, and timely medical care is not available to more than 100 million people in rural areas. To offset this imbalance, in 2005 China set out a five-year plan to invest 20 billion renminbi (RMB; US$2.4 billion) to rebuild the rural medical service system composed of village clinics and township- and county-level hospitals.\n\nThere is a shortage of doctors and nurses in China. More doctors are being trained, but most aim to leave the countryside in favor of the cities, leaving significant shortages in rural areas.\n\nIn 2016 it was reported that ticket resale was widely practised at Beijing Tongren Hospital and Peking University First Hospital. Advance tickets for outpatient consultation are sold by the hospitals for 200 yuan, but sold on for as much as 3,000 yuan. An eye doctor commented that the appointment fees did not reflect the economic value of doctors' skills and experience and that the scalpers were selling the doctor's appointment at a price the market is prepared to pay.\n\nThe Chinese medical education system is based on the British model. While some medical schools run three-year programs, hospitals tend to recruit physicians who graduated from five-year programs, while big-name hospitals only accept MDs, which takes seven years of study, including the five years of undergraduate studies, followed by the completion of a PhD in medicine. Once a student graduates from medical school, he or she must work 1–3 years in a university-affiliated hospital, after which the student is eligible to take the National Medical Licensing Examination (NMLE) for physician certification, which is conducted by the National Medical Examination Center (NMEC). If the candidate passes, he or she becomes a professional physician, and is certified by the Ministry of Health. It is illegal to practice medicine in China as a physician or assistant physician without being certified by the Ministry of Health. Physicians are allowed to open their own clinics after practicing medicine for five years.\n\nChina has one of the longest recorded history of medicine records of any existing civilization. The methods and theories of traditional Chinese medicine have developed for over two thousand years. Western medical theory and practice came to China in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries, notably through the efforts of missionaries and the Rockefeller Foundation, which together founded Peking Union Medical College. Today Chinese traditional medicine continues alongside western medicine and traditional physicians, who also receive some western medical training, are sometimes primary care givers in the clinics and pharmacies of rural China. Various traditional preventative and self-healing techniques such as qigong, which combines gentle exercise and meditation, are widely practiced as an adjunct to professional health care.\n\nAlthough the practice of traditional Chinese medicine was strongly promoted by the Chinese leadership and remained a major component of health care, Western medicine gained increasing acceptance in the 1970s and 1980s. For example, the number of physicians and pharmacists trained in Western medicine reportedly increased by 225,000 from 1976 to 1981, and the number of physicians' assistants trained in Western medicine increased by about 50,000. In 1981 there were reportedly 516,000 senior physicians trained in Western medicine and 290,000 senior physicians trained in traditional Chinese medicine. The goal of China's medical professionals is to synthesize the best elements of traditional and Western approaches.\n\nIn practice, however, this combination has not always worked smoothly. In many respects, physicians trained in traditional medicine and those trained in Western medicine constitute separate groups with different interests. For instance, physicians trained in Western medicine have been somewhat reluctant to accept unscientific traditional practices, and traditional practitioners have sought to preserve authority in their own sphere. Although Chinese medical schools that provided training in Western medicine also provided some instruction in traditional medicine, relatively few physicians were regarded as competent in both areas in the mid-1980s.\n\nThe extent to which traditional and Western treatment methods were combined and integrated in the major hospitals varied greatly. Some hospitals and medical schools of purely traditional medicine were established. In most urban hospitals, the pattern seemed to be to establish separate departments for traditional and Western treatment. In the county hospitals, however, traditional medicine received greater emphasis.\n\nTraditional medicine depends on herbal treatments, acupuncture, acupressure, moxibustion (burning of herbs over acupuncture points), \"cupping\" (local suction of skin), qigong (coordinated movement, breathing, and awareness), tui na (massage), and other culturally unique practices. Such approaches are believed to be most effective in treating minor and chronic diseases, in part because of milder side effects. Traditional treatments may be used for more serious conditions as well, particularly for such acute abdominal conditions as appendicitis, pancreatitis, and gallstones; sometimes traditional treatments are used in combination with Western treatments. A traditional method of orthopedic treatment, involving less immobilization than Western methods, continued to be widely used in the 1980s.\n\nAfter 1949 the Ministry of Public Health was responsible for all health-care activities and established and supervised all facets of health policy. Along with a system of national, provincial, and local facilities, the ministry regulated a network of industrial and state enterprise hospitals and other facilities covering the health needs of workers of those enterprises. In 1981 this additional network provided approximately 25 percent of the country's total health services.\n\nHealth care was provided in both rural and urban areas through a three-tiered system. In rural areas the first tier was made up of barefoot doctors working out of village medical centers. They provided preventive and primary-care services, with an average of two doctors per 1,000 people; given their importance as health care providers, particularly in rural areas, the government introduced measures to improve their performance through organised training and an annual licensing exam. At the next level were the township health centers, which functioned primarily as out-patient clinics for about 10,000 to 30,000 people each. These centers had about ten to thirty beds each, and the most qualified members of the staff were assistant doctors. The two lower-level tiers made up the \"rural collective health system\" that provided most of the country's medical care. Only the most seriously ill patients were referred to the third and final tier, the county hospitals, which served 200,000 to 600,000 people each and were staffed by senior doctors who held degrees from 5-year medical schools. Utilisation of health services in rural areas has been shown to increase as a result of the rise in income in rural households and the government's substantial fiscal investment in health. Health care in urban areas was provided by paramedical personnel assigned to factories and neighborhood health stations. If more professional care was necessary the patient was sent to a district hospital, and the most serious cases were handled by municipal hospitals. To ensure a higher level of care, a number of state enterprises and government agencies sent their employees directly to district or municipal hospitals, circumventing the paramedical, or barefoot doctor, stage.\nHowever, primary care in China has not developed as well as intended. The main barrier has been the scarcity of suitably-qualified health professionals. \n\n"}

One of its priority was to assess the health risks derived from food and indirectly from feed, to liaise with international and Hungarian authorities, and to communicate with the public on food safety issues. From 2012, these tasks are performed by the National Food Chain Safety Office, which was established by the integration of the Central Agricultural Office and HFSO.\n\nOne of the major responsibilities of HFSO was the scientific risk assessment relating to food safety, taking into account up-to-date scientific findings of recognised international institutions. The scientific risk assessment is based on identifying potential hazards, defining their characteristics, assessing their incidence and frequency and describing the risk. HFSO is responsible for assessing risks relating to concrete events, furthermore by analysing the data of annual official inspections concerning various agricultural, technological, environmental and biological contaminants, pesticide residues and natural toxic substances in raw and processed food. Based on the risk assessment, it forwards a proposal concerning the priority of inspections in the forthcoming period and participates in international risk assessment projects relating to individual chemical and microbiological contaminants.\n\nFostering national and international relations was another important responsibility of HFSO. Before the establishment of the National Food Chain Safety Office, this institution had been the Hungarian partner organization of the European Food Safety Authority. In addition, HFSO was the designated contact point in the EU Rapid Alert System for Food and Feed (RASFF), the World Health Organization (WHO) Food Safety Emergency Network (INFOSAN Emergency) and FAO/WHO Codex Alimentarius.\n\nFood is a product that the vast majority comes into direct contact with day-by-day as a consumer, food maker, and customer. The third core function of HFSO was to fill the gap, in providing credible, up-to-date information for both experts and the general public concerning food safety, which also reflects the latest scientific achievements. HFSO aimed to raise consumer awareness among the general public, which will enable consumers to reject products and services that are dubious from a food hygiene and food safety point of view, and to become aware of and abide by fundamental principles.\n\n\nHFSO worked with a small staff (18 people) under the supervision of the Ministry of Rural Development. All members of HFSO were public servants. Its general director was Mária Szeitzné Szabó.\n"}

Hyperthymia is similar to but more stable than hypomania with complete absence of irritability or negative mood effects.\n\nCharacteristics of the hyperthymic temperament include:\n\nThe clinical, psychiatric understanding of hyperthymia is evolving. Studies have shown that hyperthymic temperament promotes efficient performance of complex tasks under time pressure or extreme conditions. Despite this positive characterization, hyperthymia can be complicated with depressive episodes manifesting as a softer form of bipolar illness. Research also suggests a familial genetic connection of the temperament to bipolar I.\n\nAside from references in historical and more recent writings on the spectrum of mood disorders, further literature on the temperament is lacking. There is a lack of agreement on its definition, implications or whether it is pathological. It is not known where to place hyperthymia on the affective spectrum.\n\nHyperthymia manifesting intermittently or in an unusual way may mask hypomania or another psychiatric disorder.

{"id": "54779466", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=54779466", "title": "Infections associated with diseases", "text": "Infections associated with diseases\n\nInfections associated with diseases are those that are associated with possible infectious etiologies, that meet the requirements of Koch's postulates. Other methods of causation are described by the Bradford Hill criteria and Evidence-based medicine. Koch's postulates have been altered by some epidemiologists based upon sequence-based detection of distinctive pathogenic nucleic acid sequences in tissue samples. Using this method, absolute statements are not always possible regarding causation. Since this is true, higher amounts of distinctive pathogenic nucleic acid sequences would be in those exhibiting disease compared to controls since inoculating those without the pathogen is unethical. In addition, the DNA load should drop or become lower with the resolution of the disease. The distinctive pathogenic nucleic acid sequences load should also increase upon recurrence.\n\nOther conditions are met to establish cause or association including studies in disease transmission. This means that there should be a high disease occurrence in those carrying an pathogen, evidence of a serologicalresponse to the pathogen, and the success of vaccination prevention. Direct visualization of the pathogen, the identification of different strains, immunological responses in the host, how the infection is spread and, the combination of these should all be taken into account to determine the probability that an infectious agent is the cause of the disease. A conclusive determination of a causal role of an infectious agent for in a particular disease using Koch's postulates is desired yet this might not be possible.\n\nThe leading cause of death worldwide is cardiovascular disease, but infectious diseases are the second leading cause of death worldwide and the leading cause of death in infants and children.\n\nOther causes or associations of disease are: a compromised immune system, environmental toxins, radiation exposure, diet and lifestyle choices, stress, and genetics. Diseases may also be multifactorial, requiring multiple factors to induce disease. For example: in a murine model, Crohn's disease can be precipitated by a norovirus, but only when both a specific gene variant is present and a certain toxin has damaged the gut.\n\nA list of the more common and well-known diseases associated with infectious pathogens is provided and is not intended to be a complete listing.\n\nInfectious pathogen-associated diseases include many of the most common and costly chronic illnesses. The treatment of chronic diseases accounts for 75% of all US healthcare costs (amounting to $1.7 trillion in 2009).\n\nOne of first examples of systematic study of disease causation was Avicenna, in the tenth century. The history of infection and disease were observed in the 1800s and related to the one of the tick-borne diseases, Rocky Mountain spotted fever. The cause of viral encephalitis was discovered in Russia based upon epidemiological clustering of cases. The virus causing this illness was isolated in 1937. The rash typical of Lyme borreliosis was identified the early 1900s. Historically, some chronic diseases were linked or associated with infectious pathogens.\n"}
{"id": "22613352", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=22613352", "title": "International Vaccine Institute", "text": "International Vaccine Institute\n\nThe International Vaccine Institute (IVI) is an independent, nonprofit, international organization that was founded on the belief that the health of children in developing countries can be dramatically improved by the use of new and improved vaccines. Working in collaboration with the international scientific community, public health organizations, governments, and industry, IVI is involved in all areas of the vaccine spectrum – from new vaccine design in the laboratory to vaccine development and evaluation in the field to facilitating sustainable introduction of vaccines in countries where they are most needed.\n\nCreated initially as an initiative of the UN Development Programme (UNDP), IVI began formal operations as an independent international organization in 1997 in Seoul, Republic of Korea. Currently, IVI has 35 countries and the World Health Organization (WHO) as signatories to its Establishment Agreement. The Institute has a unique mandate to work exclusively on vaccine development and introduction specifically for people in developing countries, with a focus on neglected diseases affecting these regions.\n\nIn 1992, Dr. Seung-Il Shin, then Senior Health Advisor for the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP), initiated a study to explore the feasibility of establishing an international institute devoted to vaccine research and development within the framework of the Children’s Vaccine Initiative (CVI). \n\nBased on the results of Dr. Shin’s feasibility study, in 1993 the UNDP adopted a formal proposal to establish the International Vaccine Institute (IVI). In 1994, following a call for proposals to host IVI in the Asia Pacific region, the UNDP and the Republic of Korea reached an agreement to host the center in Seoul. In 1995, UNDP opened an interim IVI office on the campus of Seoul National University and the Institute began its initial work and organizational development.\n\nIn 1995 and 1996, the UNDP and the South Korean government jointly developed the basic framework and Constitution of IVI. In order to establish IVI as an independent international organization, the UNDP and Korean government elected to establish the institute through an intergovernmental agreement of UN member states, as sanctioned in the Vienna Convention on the Laws of Treaties of 1969.\n\nOn October 28, 1996, the IVI Establishment Agreement opened for signatures at the UN headquarters in New York City. Representatives of Bangladesh, Bhutan, Indonesia, Kazakhstan, Mongolia, the Netherlands, Panama, Republic of Korea, Romania, Thailand, Vietnam, Uzbekistan, and the WHO were the first to sign the agreement, followed shortly thereafter by Senegal and the Philippines.\n\nIn 1997 more countries followed, with Brazil, China, Egypt, Israel, Jamaica, Kyrgyzstan, Myanmar, Nepal, Pakistan, Papua New Guinea, Peru, Sri Lanka, Sweden, Tajikistan, and Turkey signing the Agreement.\n\nOn May 29, 1997, The IVI Establishment Agreement entered into force following the submission of instruments of ratification by South Korea, Sweden, and Uzbekistan. The IVI Establishment Agreement entered the United Nations Depository of Treaties under Chapter IX. HEALTH, section 3.\n\nOn September 24, 1998 the IVI Headquarters Agreement was signed at a formal ceremony at UNDP headquarters by South Korea’s Minister of Foreign Affairs and Trade, Hon. Hong Soon-Young and IVI Board Chairman, Dr. Barry Bloom. The Headquarters Agreement established IVI as a legal entity with diplomatic immunity in South Korea, becoming the first international organization to be headquartered in South Korea. In accordance with IVI’s independent status, the Institute formally separated from the UNDP in 1998. \nThe IVI headquarters building, located in Seoul National University’s Research Park in Seoul, South Korea, was designed by a consortium consisting of Samwoo Architects of South Korea and Payette Associates of Boston, USA. Construction began in 1998 and was completed in 2003. The building houses laboratories, animal facilities, offices, an auditorium, and a library. A separate 1,300m² pilot plant facility, intended for the production of test lots of vaccines for training and evaluation purposes, was constructed but never completed due to a lack of funding.\n\nIVI’s first major initiative, Diseases of the Most Impoverished (DOMI) was a program of research and technical assistance to accelerate the introduction of new vaccines against typhoid fever, cholera, and shigellosis into public health programs for the poor in developing countries. From 2000 to 2006, IVI’s DOMI program carried out vaccination campaigns, disease surveillance, and research studies in Bangladesh, China, India, Indonesia, Mozambique, Pakistan, Thailand, and Vietnam.  At the conclusion of the DOMI program, IVI synthesized the diverse epidemiological, clinical, economic, and behavioral findings of these studies in order to facilitate informed decision-making by policymakers at the national level on the use of vaccines against the diseases targeted by DOMI. The Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation was the primary funder of the DOMI program with a US$40 million contribution.\n\nThe DOMI Typhoid program was initiated to address the barriers of access to typhoid vaccines in the developing world and to accelerate the introduction of modern typhoid vaccines in countries where they were needed. DOMI Typhoid utilized the Vi-Polysaccharide (Vi-PS) vaccine because it is easily and inexpensively produced by manufacturers in developing countries, it is given in a single dose, and it is relatively thermostable. DOMI Typhoid operated in five study sites: Heichi, China; Kolkata, India; North Jakarta, Indonesia; Karachi, Pakistan; and Hue, Vietnam. From these sites, IVI experts conducted disease surveillance, disease burden studies, cost-of-illness studies, socio-behavioral studies, and vaccine demonstration projects. IVI presented the accumulated evidence from DOMI Typhoid in case studies to officials in each host country. As a result, policymakers in Pakistan, Indonesia, and Vietnam agreed to introduce school-based typhoid vaccination campaigns on a pilot basis. Results from China uncovered a previously unknown growing incidence rate of paratyphoid A infections in China’s Guangxi province, which led to IVI launching its Paratyphoid in China project.\n\nThe DOMI Cholera program sought to develop and accelerate the use of an affordable cholera vaccine in cholera-endemic countries. DOMI Cholera operated from five study sites: Matlab, Bangladesh; North Jakarta, Indonesia; Kolkata, India; Beira, Mozambique; and Hue, Vietnam. From these sites, IVI conducted disease burden, economic, and socio-behavioral studies and cholera vaccination campaigns. The studies found a high demand for cholera vaccine and high incidence rates (3-9/1,000) in children 5 years old and younger. IVI’s vaccination campaign in Beira saw more than 44,000 children and adults receive the internationally-licensed Dukoral vaccine. In Kolkata, IVI vaccinated more than 67,000 children and adults using an oral cholera vaccine produced by Vietnam’s VaBiotech. At the onset of DOMI Cholera, the only internationally licensed cholera vaccine available was Dukoral, but at $90 for the two-dose series, this vaccine was too expensive for public use in many of the poorest developing countries. VaBiotech’s cholera vaccine, originally developed by Vietnam’s National Institute of Health and Epidemiology following a technology transfer from the University of Gothenburg in Sweden, was not licensed for international use but showed great promise as a low-cost vaccine for the developing world. As a result, the Gates Foundation provided IVI with additional funding to establish the Cholera Vaccine Initiative (CVI) with the goal of reformulating the VaBiotech vaccine for international use. \n\nIVI established the DOMI Shigellosis program with the ultimate goal of accelerating the development and introduction of a safe and protective shigella vaccine to control epidemic and endemic disease. Between 2000 and 2004, the DOMI Shigella program ran disease surveillance sites in 6 locations across Southeast Asia: Dhaka, Bangladesh; Hebei, China; Karachi, Pakistan and neighboring villages; North Jakarta, Indonesia; Nha Trang, Vietnam; and Saraburi Province, Thailand. The program enhanced understanding of what an effective shigella vaccine will need and established an accurate disease burden in the countries where it operated. The program first evaluated an oral shigella vaccine (SC602) in Bangladesh, but it failed to elicit an immune response. The high disease burden, serotype diversity, and high levels AMR discovered at IVI's surveillance sites underscored the need for a vaccine that protects against all common strains of the disease. As a result, IVI’s Division of Laboratory Sciences initiated a multiyear program to sequence the Shigella genome and identify common proteins in different Shigella species that could be used to develop a vaccine against all common strains of the disease.\n\nIVI initiated the Rotavirus Diarrhea Program to provide policymakers in developing countries with the disease burden evidence and economic data needed to ensure the inclusion of rotavirus vaccines in their national immunization programs. Running from 1999 to 2010, the program conducted disease surveillance and economic studies in Cambodia, China, India, Indonesia, Laos, Mongolia, South Korea, Sri Lanka, and Vietnam. In 2007, in collaboration with Vietnam’s National Institute of Hygiene and Epidemiology (NIHE), IVI conducted a Phase II trial of GSK’s RotaRix rotavirus vaccine in Khanh Hoa, Vietnam.  In 2009, in collaboration with NIHE, PATH, and Merck, IVI completed a phase III trial of Merck’s RotaTeq rotavirus vaccine in Nha Trang Vietnam, where it vaccinated 900 infants.  \n\nThe Pediatric Dengue Vaccine Initiative was a product development partnership launched by IVI to accelerate the introduction of safe and effective dengue vaccines for children in dengue-endemic countries. From 2002 to 2010, PDVI operated in Brazil, Cambodia, Colombia, India, Indonesia, Laos, Malaysia, Mexico, Myanmar, Nicaragua, Sri Lanka, Thailand and Vietnam. PDVI made many contributions to dengue vaccine development, including:\n\n\nIn 2010, PDVI transitioned into the Dengue Vaccine Initiative (DVI).\n\nThe successor to PDVI, the Dengue Vaccine Initiative was an IVI-led consortium with the World Health Organization, the Sabin Vaccine Institute, the Initiative for Vaccine Research (IVR), and the International Vaccine Access Center (IVAC) at Johns Hopkins University. DVI continued the work of PDVI and focused on laying the groundwork for dengue vaccine decision-making and vaccine introduction in endemic areas. Each consortium member was responsible for a specific component: WHO – information and guidance documents, and regulatory training activities; Johns Hopkins – dengue vaccine financing and strategic demand forecasting; and Sabin – communications and advocacy. Besides leading the consortium, IVI generated evidence for decision-making such as disease burden, country vaccine introduction cases and a global investment case. From 2010 to 2016, DVI operated in Brazil, Burkina Faso, Cambodia, Colombia, Gabon, India, Kenya, Thailand, and Vietnam. From 2013-2015, with funding from Germany’s Federal Ministry of Education & Research (BMBF), IVI continued support for preclinical development of dengue vaccines by Brazil’s Butantan Institute and Vietnam’s VaBiotech. After the 2016 licensure of Sanofi Pasteur’s Dengvaxia vaccine, the DVI project came to a close and its IVI staff transitioned to a new project, the Global Dengue & Aedes-Transmitted Disease Consortium (GDAC).\n\nAs of January 2011, IVI includes 40 countries and the World Health Organization (WHO) as signatories to its Establishment Agreement. To be more specific, there are 33 signatory countries, which are the states that express their consent to be bound by a treaty by signing the treaty without the need for ratification, acceptance of approval. These states may definitively sign a treaty only when the treaty so permits. In addition, there are 16 parties which involve Liberia, Republic of Korea, Brazil, Mongolia, China, Sri Lanka, Ecuador, Sweden, Netherlands, Oman, Pakistan, Uzbekistan, Vietnam, Peru, Philippines, and the World Health Organization (WHO). A major difference between a signatory and a party is that a party to a treaty is a state or other entity with treaty-making capacity that has expressed its consent to be bound by that treaty by an act of ratification, acceptance, approval or accession etc. where that treaty has entered into force for that particular State.\n\nIn short, in addition to the World Health Organization (WHO), 40 countries include Bangladesh, Liberia**, Republic of Korea**, Bhutan, Malta, Romania, Brazil**, Mongolia**, Senegal, China**, Myanmar, Sri Lanka**, Ecuador**, Nepal, Sweden**, Egypt, Netherlands**, Tajikistan, Indonesia, Oman**, Thailand, Israel, Pakistan**, Turkey, Jamaica, Panama, Uzbekistan**, Kazakhstan, Papua New Guinea, Vietnam**, Kyrgyzstan, Peru**, Lebanon, Philippines**, Cote d'Ivoire, India, Kuwait, Slovakia, Spain, and United Arab Emirates.\n\n\n"}

This is the only university exclusively for the disabled in India and the world.\n\nIt was established on 27 September 2001 by Jagadguru Rambhadracharya and is run by the Jagadguru Rambhadracharya Viklang Shikshan Sansthan trust. The university was created by an ordinance by the Uttar Pradesh government, which was later passed as the Uttar Pradesh State Act 32 (2001) by the Uttar Pradesh legislature. The act appointed Jagadguru Rambhadracharya as the lifelong chancellor.\n\nThe university offers graduate, post-graduate and doctorate degrees in concentrations including Sanskrit, Hindi, English, Sociology, Psychology, Fine Arts, Special Education, Education, History, Culture & Archeology, Computer & Information Sciences, Vocational Education, Law, Economics, and Prosthetics and Orthotics. It plans to start offering courses in Ayurveda and Medical Sciences from 2013. Admissions are restricted to the four types of disabled students: visually impaired, hearing impaired, mobility impaired and mentally impaired, as defined by the Disability Act (1995) of the Government of India. 354 disabled students were awarded degrees in the second convocation of the university held in March 2010. In the third convocation held in January 2011, 388 students were awarded degrees. All of the facilities, such as classrooms, hostel, laboratory, etc., are accessible and adapted for the disabled. An International Ramcharitmanas Research Center isin the university.\n\nThe majority of students are from Uttar Pradesh, Bihar and Madhya Pradesh. However, students have come from Assam, Maharashtra, Chhattisgarh and Uttarakhand.\n\nOn 23 August 1996, Swami Rambhadracharya established the Tulasi School for the Blind in Chitrakoot. After this, he decided to establish an institution of higher learning solely for disabled students. With this aim, he founded the Jagadguru Rambhadracharya Handicapped University on 27 September 2001 in Chitrakoot, Uttar Pradesh. The foundation stone was laid on 2 April 2001. The university was inaugurated by Rajnath Singh on 26 July 2011. The planned name was Chitrakoot Handicapped University (CHU), but later Jagadguru Rambhadracharya Handicapped University was chosen.\n\n\nThe university was founded initially by the JRHU Ordinance, enacted by the governor of Uttar Pradesh on 7 August 2001. The ordinance was replaced by the JRHU Act passed on 5 October 2001. Classes began on 23 August 2001. In 2002, it was granted membership in the Association of Indian Universities, New Delhi.\n\nJRHU was designed to ensure greater accessibility for the disabled to higher education. Students are provided with a disabled-friendly campus and classrooms, at an affordable cost. Courses in basic Sanskrit and computer skills are mandatory. Courses are available in Braille for visually impaired students. Hostel facility meeting special needs of disabled students is provided, including those of the visually and hearing impaired. Hostel facility is provided in the university and Tulsi Peeth, a religious and social service institution established by Rambharacharya.\n\nThe logo of the university represents the four types of disability (visual, hearing, physical and mental impairment), along with the Sanskrit motto। सेवाधर्मः परमगहनः। (IAST: sevādharmaḥ paramagahanaḥ, meaning \"the duty of service is extremely difficult\") and the photograph of the lifelong chancellor.\n\nJagadguru Rambhadracharya Handicapped University offers many degrees. B.A. and M.A. degrees are provided in Sanskrit, Hindi, English, Sociology, Music, Drawing & Painting, History, Culture & Archaeology. Other courses include MSW (Master of Social Work), B.Mus., BFA (Bachelor in Fine Art), B.Ed., M.Ed. Special, B.Ed. (Bachelor of Education), M.Ed. (Master of Education) (Hearing Impairment & Visual Impairment), BCA (Bachelor of Computer Application), BBA (Bachelor of Business Administration), PGDIT (Post-graduate Diploma in Information Technology), DIT (Diploma in Information Technology), Diploma in Photography & Video Shooting, Diploma in Handmade Paper, Law (five-year integrated course), BPO (Bachelor in Prosthetics & Orthotics) condensed course, BPO (Bachelor in Prosthetics & Orthotics) five-year integrated course and B.A. courses in Psychology.\n\nMany notable visitors have been to JRHU. Some of them are chief minister of Uttar Pradesh Akhilesh Yadav, former UP CM Rajnath Singh, member of Rajya Sabha Murli Manohar Joshi, chairman of UGC Arun Nigvekar, former union minister Uma Bharati, general secretary of AIU Dayanand Donagaokar, former chief justice of Allahabad High Court Hemant Laxman Gokhale, former vice chancellor of the University of Kashmir Abdul Wahid, sitting judge of the Supreme Court of India Markandey Katju, justice of the Supreme Court of India Dalveer Bhandari, justice of the Allahabad high court Singh and former major-general Ian Cardozo.\n\nThe creation of the university was highly supported by the Government of Uttar Pradesh. JRHU also receives support from UGC. The registrar, Avanish Chandra Mishra, said that they received help from Rehabilitation Council of India for courses in Information Technology, Teacher Training Programme, Fine Art, Music, etc. The university has been declared eligible to receive central assistance under section 12(b) of UGC Act 1956.\n\n\nTo assist its students in selecting appropriate courses/programmes and getting placements based on their performances, JRHU has a placement center. The centre also arranges capsule training programmes to help youth for proper rehabilitation.\n\nTo reach out to students with limited mobility, the university offers distance education programs online, recognised by the Distance Education Council, IGNOU, New Delhi. Like other programs at the university, these are available only for the disabled.\n\n\n"}

She works in both English and Pitkern, the island's distinctive creole language. Her book, \"Mi Base side orn Pitcairn\", written with the island's six children, is the first to be written and published in both English and Pitkern. As an artist, she works with tapa cloth, a Polynesian tradition. She has also published a cookbook featuring Pitcairn Island cuisine. \n\nWarren has also served as the island's nurse, its only police officer, a ham radio operator, and as a member of the territory's governing council, among many other roles.\n\nWarren was born on Pitcairn Island on 28 June 1959, the second child of Jacob Ralph \"Chippie\" Warren (1920–2007) and Mavis Mary Brown (born 1936). Warren is the sister of Jay Warren (born 1950) who served as the third mayor of the Pitcairn Islands (2004–2007), and previously as the colony's 29th magistrate (1991–1997). She is a first cousin of Mike Warren (born 1964), the colony's fourth mayor (2007–2014). She is the descendant of mutineers from the famed Mutiny on the \"Bounty\" (1789) and of the Tahitian men and women who journeyed with the mutineers in settling the island in 1790.\n\nWarren is a poet, and the author of two books, including \"Mi Base side orn Pitcairn\" (\"My Favourite Place on Pitcairn\"), written with children on Pitcairn Island. It is the first book written and published in Pitkern and English.\n\nHer works include a cookbook, \"Taste of Pitcairn\" featuring the cuisine of the Pitcairn Islands, and poetry in both Pitkern and English. Pitkern is an English-based creole language derived from eighteenth-century English and Tahitian. She writes poetry in both English and Pitkern.\n\nIn 2007, Warren revived Pitcairn's tradition of art created on tapa cloth, a woven bark cloth common in Polynesian culture. Her works have been displayed in museums and galleries in Tahiti, Norfolk Island, and New Zealand. In 2011, she was one of seven artists awarded a Commonwealth Connections International Arts Residency, which provided a grant of £8,000 that allowed her to work with other artists in New Zealand. She is the first recipient from the Pitcairn Islands.\n\nPitcairn has a small population. The island's 48 residents often serve in several capacities or jobs. Warren describes her many roles on her personal website:\n\nTravelling with patients to New Zealand and Tahiti and taking up Nursing, Radio Operator for the shore to ship skeds from ZBP station and twice daily contact with Auckland international Radio telephone link, Working in our Co-op store, Council member for many years as well as being the Governors appointee member to council a few times, Becoming the first female Police & Immigration Officer for a few years. Lands Commission president, Lands court member, Bee keeper since 1978. ASL operator for siesmic Vault, Installing wireless networking throughout Adamstown, Duncan cleaner, Contract Lawnmowing jobs, and many misc jobs inc Tourism and Entertainment. PHEWWwww. it became apprent to me that what I enjoy most is my art. (T)his is getting pushed aside whilst I am working these time consuming no pay or low paid positions which was making me very tired and yes...Bitchy\n\nBeginning in 1996, Warren served as the island's only police officer. However, since no one had been arrested on the island since the 1950s, her duties involved issuing driving licences and stamping visitors' passports. Warren had no qualifications or formal training to be a police officer, and was given the job because everyone on the island had a \"job\". The island's jail was described as \"the size of a garden shed and riddled with termites\", and its cells had been used to store building materials and lifejackets. When the island came into the international spotlight due to a sexual abuse scandal, a law enforcement professional sent to the island criticized their practices, stating \"It was glaringly obvious...that their standard of policing was not really adequate.\"\n\nWarren was elected on 15 December 2004 to the Island Council. As a radio operator, she broadcasts under the call sign VP6MW.\n\nWarren was an outspoken critic of accusations that the island's girls had been sexually abused when young, and the prosecution of a selected number of Pitcairn's male residents. She claimed that young girls on Pitcairn customarily became sexually active after age 12, a practice of underage sex that had been accepted as a Polynesian tradition since the settlement of the island in 1790. One resident, Olive Christian, said of her girlhood, \"We all thought sex was like food on the table.\" \n\nMany Pitcairn Island men blamed the British police for persuading the women involved to press charges. Some of the women agreed, and advocated a conspiracy theory that the trial was, in Warren's words, \"a British plot to jail the [community's] able-bodied men and 'close' the island\", and that the British officials \"picked on all the viable young men, the ones who are the backbone of this place\".\n\nA majority of the island's residents denied or excused the allegations. During the trial, Warren circulated a poem titled \"Is Seven a Lucky Number?\" that criticized the British government and lawyers' attempts to impose British law against their island's traditions.\n\n<poem>“There’s never an age consent set in our Laws\nOh 16 is in the British clause\nWhat book they choose\nWhat next law will they ruse\nWhy must these Seven men be used”</poem>\n\nAs the case wore on, Warren reflected that \"the bottom had fallen out of our world … We lost our trust for each other.\" Her brother, Jay Warren, who was accused of \"indecent assault\", was the only defendant among the seven accused to be acquitted on 24 October 2004.\n\nWarren was convicted of assault during a drunken disagreement with another resident when the two were angered by tensions over the sexual abuse matter. The case was prosecuted by a Crown prosecutor and tried by a New Zealand magistrate. Warren was fined NZ$60. The case cost the British government NZ$40,000 to prosecute.\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "13270091", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=13270091", "title": "Nicotine Anonymous", "text": "Nicotine Anonymous\n\nNicotine Anonymous (NicA) is a twelve-step program for people desiring to quit smoking and live free of nicotine. As of July 2017, there are over 700 face-to-face meetings in 32 countries worldwide with the majority of these meetings occurring in the United States, Iran, India, Canada, Brazil, the United Kingdom, Australia, Russia and in various online community and social media platforms.. NicA maintains that total abstinence from nicotine is necessary for recovery. NicA defines abstinence as “a state that begins when all use of nicotine ceases.\n\nThe first meetings began in February 1982 in Southern California by several AA members to focus specifically on smoking cessation. These AA members began meeting under the name Smokers Anonymous in Los Angeles. Shortly thereafter another group independently started in San Francisco. \n\nIn 1983, a Manhattan, New York group of meetings formed independently, also formed by recovering AA members, specifically to address their smoking addiction. They called themselves \"AA for Non-Smokers\". During the same period, two groups started in Cleveland, Ohio.\n\nThen in May 1985, Maurice Z., a California member, authored an article for Reader’s Digest. Thousands of letters poured in from people wanting to know more about this new Twelve-Step fellowship. That year Smokers Anonymous groups started independently in Woodstock, NY and in Islip, NY. Within a year there were a hundred meetings identified.\n\nIn 1986 the group members met for their first conference in Bakersfield, California to form a fellowship, originally known as \"Smokers Anonymous\".\n\nThese groups met again in 1987 in Monterey, California. In April 1988, the fellowship’s first official World Services Conference was held in San Francisco.\n\nThe fellowship was renamed Nicotine Anonymous in Phoenix, Arizona at the 1990 World Services Conference because the Smokers Anonymous trademark was not available, but also, importantly, the delegates decided the focus of recovery should be on the drug nicotine rather than any single nicotine delivery system.\n\nIn 2000, \"NicA\" was selected to abbreviate Nicotine Anonymous at the annual World Service Conference.\n\nAdapted with permission of Alcoholics Anonymous World Services, Inc., the Twelve Traditions are utilized by Nicotine Anonymous as fundamental guiding principles. Nicotine Anonymous operates with an elected, all volunteer, nine member board of officers and a set of by-laws. The board meets regularly to discuss how to be of service to the organization including organizing its annual World Service Conference and monitoring a number of appointed committee coordinators and the Nicotine Anonymous World Service home office located in Dallas, TX. The office keeps regularly updated meeting lists, manages the website and its online store, distributes NicA literature and free Meeting Starter Kits, and serves as a resource for members or any interested nicotine user. There are no dues or fees for NicA membership, as stated in Tradition Three: \"the only requirement for Nicotine Anonymous membership is a desire to stop using nicotine.\"\n\nThere are several commercial and nonprofit programs supporting smoking cessation programs in the United States. Low-cost options, in addition to Nicotine Anonymous, are sponsored by groups such as The American Cancer Society, The American Lung Association, The American Heart Association and The Seventh-day Adventist Church. Commercial programs include cognitive-behavioral group therapy, nicotine replacement therapies and bupropion. Combinations of these approaches, marketed in commercial packages such as Smokeless and Smoke Stoppers, are licensed to treatment providers and conducted on an inpatient or outpatient basis. These are in addition to local programs ran by regional treatment facilities.\n\nA weekly NicA meeting is ongoing and therefore unique among the array of treatment options because nicotine users and ex-nicotine users can enter and leave the process as they please. Most other treatment programs are structured as limited duration programs, with only a certain number of sessions, making it difficult for members to pick it up midway through or begin when a program is not being offered.\n\nIn 1996, NicA ranked twelfth in size among the thirteen twelve-step organizations studied by Klaus Makela. Sponsorship and lifetime attendance is not emphasized as much as in other twelve-step programs. The average meeting size is about seven people.\n\nAlthough both drinking and smoking are recognized by many respondents as imposing burdens on the family, there are no auxiliary support groups for friends and family of smokers related to NicA; as Al-Anon meetings were created for friends and family members of alcoholics. Nicotine Anonymous World Services does, however, offer a pamphlet, \"Are You Concerned About Someone Who Smokes or Chews Tobacco?\" with information for friends and family of nicotine users.\n\nSuccess in achieving smoking abstinence using current smoking therapies such as Nicotine Anonymous, cognitive-behavioral group therapy, nicotine replacement therapies and bupropion (Zyban) ranges from 9% to 40% in different studies. Alcoholics and drug addicts have better smoking cessation success rates when attempting to quit smoking early in recovery. Combining psychosocial and pharmacological treatments increases smoking cessation success rates. Acupuncture, hypnosis, inpatient treatment, and Nicotine Anonymous have not been shown effective thus far.\n\nIn a controlled study 205 alcoholics, with heavy tobacco dependence (an average of 26.8 cigarettes per day) and three months or more of continuous abstinence from drugs and alcohol, were placed at random in one of three treatment groups: an American Lung Association Quit Program plus Nicotine Anonymous meetings group, a behavioral counseling plus physical exercise group, or a behavioral counseling plus nicotine gum group. The effectiveness of the treatment programs was measured at post-treatment, six months, and twelve-months following post-treatment based on self-reports confirmed by confirmed biochemical and informant reports. Immediately following treatment the behavior counseling and exercise group had the highest quit percentage (60%) followed by the behavioral counseling plus nicotine gum group, with the ALA quit program plus NicA group at 31%. At the six-month follow up all groups had similar percentages of members maintaining abstinence from tobacco (29%, 27%, and 21%, respectively) and also at twelve-months (27%, 27%, and 26%, respectively). Out of all the participants, only 4% relapsed on alcohol or drugs. The alcohol relapse rate did not differ by treatment group.\n\nIn a survey of 104 smokers (ages 18 and older) 78% reported they believed spiritual resources could be helpful in an attempt to quit smoking. In the same survey, male smokers, ages 31 and over, and females were found to be significantly more open to using spiritual resources in the smoking cessation process than controls. Heavy smokers, those smoking more than fifteen cigarettes per day, were also significantly more receptive to encouragement of spiritual resources in an attempt to quit.\n\nAlcoholics may have experienced twelve-step approaches to recovery and therefore may be more open to the possibility that same approach can be used to initiate and maintain abstinence from tobacco use. The first edition of \"Nicotine Anonymous: The Book\" published results of an internal survey of members showing that 25% of members responding to a survey on the topic reported they had prior twelve-step experience. Many smokers do not see group treatment as a potentially useful.\n\nNicotine Anonymous publishes eight books, sixteen pamphlets, two CDs, and one newsletter. \"Nicotine Anonymous: The Book\" explains the various principles of the Twelve Steps as they apply to nicotine addiction and includes testimonials from NicA members. \"Nicotine Anonymous Newcomer’s Booklet\" is a pocket sized booklet that answers common questions about the program and includes helpful tips. \"Nicotine Anonymous Step Study Workbook\" briefly discusses aspects of each Step and is followed by questions for the member to answer. \"Our Path to Freedom: Twelve Stories of Recovery\" includes testimonials from NicA members. \"90 Days, 90 Ways\" has 90 daily meditations on topics related to recovery from nicotine addiction. \"A Year of Miracles\" has 366 daily meditations further expanding on topics related to recovery from nicotine addiction. \"The Twelve Traditions of Nicotine Anonymous (Extended Version)\" includes a complete copy of the explanations for all Twelve Traditions. \"Bylaws of Nicotine Anonymous\" has the rules and regulations for how Nicotine Anonymous World Services operates.\nThe pamphlets provide information to new and prospective members, and include titles as follows: \"Introducing Nicotine Anonymous; To the Newcomer and Sponsorship in Nicotine Anonymous; Out Policy of Openness; How Nicotine Anonymous Works; Nicotine Anonymous the Program and the Tools; A Nicotine User's View of the Twelve Steps; The Serenity Prayer for Nicotine Users; Slogans to Help Us be Happy, Joyous, and Free Living Without Nicotine; Abstinence: What is it?; Tips for Gaining Freedom From Nicotine; Facing the Fatal Attraction; To the Dipper and Chewer; Our Promises; World Services, My intergroup, and Me; Introducing Nicotine Anonymous to the Medical Profession; Are You Concerned About Someone Who Smokes or Chews Tobacco? For the Friends and Family of Nicotine Addicts\". \"Voices of NicA\" is a CD that has audio shares from members covering their experience, strength and hope in their nicotine recovery. There is also a CD with an audio content of \"Nicotine Anonymous: The Book\" and \"Our Path to Freedom\". \"Seven Minutes\" is a quarterly newsletter used to keep members informed about developments within the organization and members’ recovery contributions.\n\nA NicA pamphlet, \"Tips for Gaining Freedom from Nicotine\", was reviewed in 1999 by a convenience sample of twelve professional colleagues of psychologist Edward Lichtenstein. These professionals were asked to review the cessation tips from the pamphlet and rate them on whether they were cognitive, behavioral, or neither. To that extent, they also rated how consistent the tips were with current cognitive-behavioral cessation techniques. It was found that many of the tips were very consistent with modern cognitive-behavioral smoking cessation treatment programs. The cognitive behavioral tips included setting dates, making commitments, planning things to keep one's mind off smoking, having something to fidget with, having something to put in one's mouth, rewarding oneself when goals have been met, remembering that discomfort associated with withdrawal will subside within two weeks. One tip was found to be spiritual, \"Pray instead of puff\". Since 1999 many of the NicA pamphlets have been updated and current versions may not contain the information analyzed.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "3148461", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=3148461", "title": "Pesticide residue", "text": "Pesticide residue\n\nPesticide residue refers to the pesticides that may remain on or in food after they are applied to food crops. The maximum allowable levels of these residues in foods are often stipulated by regulatory bodies in many countries. Regulations such as pre-harvest intervals also often prevent harvest of crop or livestock products if recently treated in order to allow residue concentrations to decrease over time to safe levels before harvest. Exposure of the general population to these residues most commonly occurs through consumption of treated food sources, or being in close contact to areas treated with pesticides such as farms or lawns.\n\nMany of these chemical residues, especially derivatives of chlorinated pesticides, exhibit bioaccumulation which could build up to harmful levels in the body as well as in the environment. Persistent chemicals can be magnified through the food chain and have been detected in products ranging from meat, poultry, and fish, to vegetable oils, nuts, and various fruits and vegetables.\n\nA pesticide is a substance or a mixture of substances used for killing pests: organisms dangerous to cultivated plants or to animals. The term applies to various pesticides such as insecticide, fungicide, herbicide and nematocide. Applications of pesticides to crops and animals may leave residues in or on food when it is consumed, and those specified derivatives are considered to be of toxicological significance.\n\nFrom post-World War II era, chemical pesticides have become the most important form of pest control. There are two categories of pesticides, first-generation pesticides and second-generation pesticide. The first-generation pesticides, which were used prior to 1940, consisted of compounds such as arsenic, mercury, and lead. These were soon abandoned because they were highly toxic and ineffective. The second-generation pesticides were composed of synthetic organic compounds. The growth in these pesticides accelerated in late 1940s after Paul Müller discovered DDT in 1939. The effects of pesticides such as aldrin, dieldrin, endrin, chlordane, parathion, captan and 2,4-D were also found at this time. Those pesticides were widely used due to its effective pest control. However, in 1946, people started to resist to the widespread use of pesticides, especially DDT since it harms non-target plants and animals. People became aware of problems with residues and its potential health risks. In the 1960s, Rachel Carson wrote \"Silent Spring\" to illustrate a risk of DDT and how it is threatening biodiversity.\n\nEach country adopts their own agricultural policies and Maximum Residue Limits (MRL) and Acceptable Daily Intake (ADI). The level of food additive usage varies by country because forms of agriculture are different in regions according to their geographical or climatical factors.\n\nPre-harvest intervals are also set to require a crop or livestock product not be harvested before a certain period after application in order to allow the pesticide residue to decrease below maximum residue limits or other tolerance levels. Likewise, restricted entry intervals are the amount of time to allow residue concentrations to decrease before a worker can reenter an area where pesticides have been applied without protective equipment.\n\nSome countries use the International Maximum Residue Limits -Codex Alimentarius to define the residue limits; this was established by Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) and World Health Organization (WHO) in 1963 to develop international food standards, guidelines codes of practices, and recommendation for food safety. Currently the CODEX has 185 Member Countries and 1 member organization (EU).\n\nThe following is the list of maximum residue limits (MRLs) for spices adopted by the commission. \n\nIn September 2008, the European Union issued new and revised Maximum Residue Limits (MRLs) for the roughly 1,100 pesticides ever used in the world. The revision was intended to simplify the previous system, under which certain pesticide residues were regulated by the Commission; others were regulated by Member States, and others were not regulated at all.\n\nFood Standards Australia New Zealand develops the standards for levels of pesticide residues in foods through a consultation process. The New Zealand Food Safety Authority publishes the maximum limits of pesticide residues for foods produced in New Zealand.\n\nMonitoring of pesticide residues in the UK began in the 1950s. From 1977 to 2000 the work was carried out by the Working Party on Pesticide Residues (WPPR), until in 2000 the work was taken over by the Pesticide Residue Committee (PRC). The PRC advise the government through the Pesticides Safety Directorate and the Food Standards Agency (FSA).\n\nIn the US, tolerances for the amount of pesticide residue that may remain on food are set by the EPA, and measures are taken to keep pesticide residues below the tolerances. The US EPA has a web page for the allowable tolerances. In order to assess the risks associated with pesticides on human health, the EPA analyzed individual pesticide active ingredients as well as the common toxic effect that groups of pesticides have, called the cumulative risk assessment. Limits that the EPA sets on pesticides before approving them includes a determination of how often the pesticide should be used and how it should be used, in order to protect the public and the environment. In the US, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and USDA also routinely check food for the actual levels of pesticide residues.\n\nA US organic food advocacy group, the Environmental Working Group, is known for creating a list of fruits and vegetables referred to as the Dirty Dozen; it lists produce with the highest number of distinct pesticide residues or most samples with residue detected in USDA data. This list is generally considered misleading and lacks scientific credibility because it lists detections without accounting for the risk of the usually small amount of each residue with respect to consumer health. In 2016, over 99% of samples of US produce had no pesticide residue or had residue levels well below the EPA tolerance levels for each pesticide.\n\nIn Japan, pesticide residues are regulated by the .\n\nPesticide tolerances are set by the Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare through the Drug and Food Safety Committee. Unlisted residue amounts are restricted to 0.01ppm.\n\nIn China, the Ministry of Health and the Ministry of Agriculture have jointly established mechanisms and working procedures relating to maximum residue limit standards, while updating them continuously, according to the food safety law and regulations issued by the State Council. From GB25193-2010 to GB28260-2011, from Maximum Residue Limits for 12 Pesticides to 85 pesticides, they have improved the standards in response to Chinese national needs.\n\nMany pesticides achieve their intended use of killing pests by disrupting the nervous system. Due to similarities in brain biochemistry among many different organisms, there is much speculation that these chemicals can have a negative impact on humans as well. \nThere are epidemiological studies that show positive correlations between exposure to pesticides through occupational hazard, which tends to be significantly higher than that ingested by the general population through food, and the occurrence of certain cancers. Although most of the general population may not exposed to large portion of pesticides, many of the pesticide residues that are attached tend to be lipophilic and can bio-accumulate in the body.\n\nAccording to the American Cancer Society there is no evidence that pesticide residues increase the risk of people getting cancer. They advise washing fruit and vegetables before eating to remove both pesticide residue and other undesirable contaminants.\n\nIn China, a number of incidents have occurred where state limits were exceeded by large amounts or where the wrong pesticide was used. In August 1994, a serious incident of pesticide poisoning of sweet potato crops occurred in Shandong province, China. Because local farmers were not fully educated in the use of insecticides, they used the highly-toxic pesticide named parathion instead of trichlorphon. It resulted in over 300 cases of poisoning and 3 deaths. Also, there was a case where a large number of students were poisoned and 23 of them were hospitalized because of vegetables that contained excessive pesticide residues.\n\nChildren are thought to be especially vulnerable to exposure to pesticide residues, especially if exposure occurs at critical windows of development. Infants and children consume higher amounts of food and water relative to their body-weight have higher surface area (i.e. skin surface) relative to their volume, and have a more permeable blood-brain barrier, and engage in behaviors like crawling and putting objects in their mouths, all of which can contribute to increased risks from exposure to pesticide residues through food or environmental routes. Neurotoxins and other chemicals that originate from pesticides pose the biggest threat to the developing human brain and nervous system. Presence of pesticide metabolites in urine samples have been implicated in disorders such as attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), autism, behavioral and emotional problems, and delays in development. There is a lack of evidence of a direct cause-and-effect relationship between long-term, low-dose exposure to pesticide residues and neurological disease, partly because manufacturers are not always legally required to examine potential long-term threats.\n\n\n"}

All ten existing members of the Council were dismissed by President Donald Trump on 28 December 2017, following the resignation of six members in June 2017 in protest at Trump's health policies.\n\nThe Council was not the first Presidential inquiry into HIV. In 1987, Ronald Reagan appointed the President's Commission on the HIV Epidemic (1987–88) to investigate the AIDS epidemic. This was followed by the National Commission on AIDS (1989-1993).\n\nThere are no current members as of 1 December 2018\n\n\nCritics have said they lack confidence in PACHA and note that the Council as reorganized under President Bush held only two meetings in 2002 and issued only five recommendations to the White House. By comparison, the President's Commission on the HIV Epidemic (Watkins Commission) submitted 597 recommendations to the Reagan Administration.\n\nThe Union of Concerned Scientists released a report in February 2004 entitled Scientific Integrity in Policymaking that said that President Bush intentionally appointed under-qualified individuals to PACHA as part of a broader effort to manipulate the government's scientific advisory system by providing the appearance of expert advice while controlling the advice given.\n\nCritics pointed to the appointment of Dr. Joseph McIlhaney, a Texas-based doctor known for rejecting the use of condoms to prevent the spread of HIV and other sexually transmitted diseases and for his advocacy of abstinence-only programs despite negligible evidence that they reduce pregnancy rates among young people.\n\nSix members of the committee resigned in June 2017, citing as the reason that the president, \"has no strategy to address the ongoing HIV/AIDS epidemic, seeks zero input from experts to formulate HIV policy, and—most concerning—pushes legislation that will harm people living with HIV and halt or reverse important gains made in the fight against this disease\".\nIn December 2017 Trump dismissed all the remaining 16 members.\nGabriel Maldonado, a former member of PACHA, said in a Washington Post article \"Like any administration, they want their own people there,\" identifying \"ideological and philosophical differences\" and that many of the remaining members, including her, were appointed by former President Barack Obama. \"I was co-chair of the disparities committee,\" Maldonado added, \"so much of my advocacy and policy references surrounded vulnerable populations, addressing issuing of diverse communities, specifically looking at the impacts of the LGBT community, namely, the disproportionate impact of HIV and AIDS to people of color, gay men, transgender women...and a lot of those key vulnerable populations are not being prioritized in this administration.\"\nNewsweek stated that there were fears that \"the charter for PACHA will be re-written with renewed focus on abstinence and religious, non-evidence based public health approaches.\" \n\n\n"}

{"id": "17305444", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=17305444", "title": "Siriraj Medical Museum", "text": "Siriraj Medical Museum\n\nThe Siriraj Medical Museum, nicknamed the Museum of Death, is a medical museum in Bangkok, Thailand. Siriraj Medical Museum is open to the public and is a valuable resource for medical professionals and students. This museum consists of five small medical museums: Ellis Pathological Museum, Congdon Anatomical Museum, Sood Sangvichien Prehistoric Museum and Laboratory, Parasitology Museum, and Songkran Niyomsane Forensic Medicine Museum.\n\nAs the very first museum to be part of Siriraj Hospital, the Ellis Pathological Museum was founded by Prof. Dr. Aller G. Ellis, M.D., an American pathologist who began the practice of collecting disease-identified specimens of patients for his pathology class. The museum showcases the top killers of Thai people, heart disease and cancer, and different types of congenital anomalies along with proper treatment and preventive measures.\n\nUnderstanding human anatomy is at the core of the study of medicine. This museum has a collection, established by Dr Edgar Davidson Congdon, of more than 2,000 organs available for anatomical education. The museum displays the anatomical structure of all the systems of the human body, ranging from conception to reproductive age. Different forms of multiple births can be found on display. The range of muscles in the human body, the smallest of which is the size of an eyelash and the biggest of which is the size of a leg can also be seen. On display is a masterful dissection of the whole-body nervous and arterial system by Dr Patai Sirikarun, the one and only exhibit of its kind in the world.\n\nIn 1960, Dr Sood Sangvichien, a specialist in anatomy and anthropology, joined an excavating mission at the archaeological site at Chorakhe Phueak in Kanchanaburi Province. The site is considered to be one of Thailand's most significant prehistoric excavation sites. There, he had the opportunity to study the tools, appliances, ornaments, and earthenware that were buried with the skeletons. He collected these objects and they became the first exhibits at his museum, officially open to the public in 1972. The museum takes visitors back to prehistoric civilization, when pieces of a Homo erectus skeleton known as \"Lampang man\" were found in Thailand. \"Lampang man\" lived approximately 1,000,000 – 400,000 years ago, making him a contemporary of \"Peking man\". The exhibit includes tools from three different ages, the Paleolithic, Mesolithic and Neolithic, aged over 1,000,000 – 4,000 years, as well as beads, colourful stones and various designs of painted earthenware.\n\nDr Vichitr Chaiyaporn, the founder of this museum, collected parasites from his patients. They are displayed here with a presentation of their life cycle and natural habitat. A wide variety of parasites, ranging from those that are not visible to the naked eye (protozoa), to those up to a metre-long (flat worms) are on display, in addition to information about types of food, cooking processes favouring growth of the parasites, disease-carrying insects, venomous animals, and preventive measures.\n\nForensic medicine is the application of medical and scientific methodology to the identification of the causes of unnatural death. The exhibits include displays of skulls and various body parts in glass cases, many of them from murder victims, evidence that Dr Songkran Niyomsane, a forensic pathologist, collected in the course of his career.\n\nThis museum includes the mummified remains of the first known serial killer in modern Thai history, Si Ouey Sae Urng, erroneously romanized on the exhibit as \"Si Quey\" (\"sae\" signifies a Chinese clan name, in this case the family of \"Urng\"). Si Quey was a cannibal who preyed on children in the 1950s, first murdering them and then eating them. He was finally caught, convicted, and executed. His mummified remains were put on display as a deterrent to others.\n\n"}
{"id": "2061264", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2061264", "title": "Sisters of St. Joseph", "text": "Sisters of St. Joseph\n\nThe Sisters of St. Joseph, also known as the Congregation of the Sisters of St. Joseph and abbreviated C.S.J. or S.S.J., is a Roman Catholic religious congregation of women founded in Le Puy-en-Velay, France, in 1650. This Congregation has approximately 14,000 members worldwide: about 7,000 in the United States; 2,000 in France; and are active in fifty other countries.\n\nThe Sisters of Saint Joseph comprise three international congregations (Lyons, Chambéry, and Annecy) and four federations (French, Italian, US, and Canadian), representing more than 14,000 Sisters worldwide and founded by joseph romanos\n\nThe Congregation of the Sisters of St Joseph of Lyons number nearly 1,000, serving in four provinces (Maine, Mexico, India and Europe) in fifteen countries. The Sisters operate many Catholic schools and hospitals in France, the United States, Canada, Japan and England. In India they operate hospitals, homes, and orphanages.\n\nThe Congregation of the Sisters of St. Joseph was founded by Jean-Pierre Medaille (although older accounts attribute his to his brother, Jean Paul). Medaille sought to establish an ecclesiastically approved congregation of women who would profess simple vows, live in a small group, with no specific apostolates and would dress in a common garb of the women of their day. The original six sisters were Anna Brun, an orphan; Marguerite Burdier; war widow, Claudia Chastel; Anna Chraleyer; Anna Vey, age 15; and Francoise Eyraud, a hospital administrator, served as superior of the new community for 30 years. The Bishop of LePuy, France, Henri de Maupas gave the foundation canonical status. Although the Congregation celebrates October 15, 1650 as its beginning, there is evidence that points to an earlier founding, more likely between 1646 and 1650. All the women made ribbon and lace that gave them some income to support themselves. In turn they taught others to make lace and ribbon.\n\nThe new Congregation enjoyed rapid growth, expanding into eighteen houses during the first decade. By the time of the French Revolution, almost 150 years later, the Sisters had spread to twelve dioceses in the southeast corner of France. The Congregation of Saint Joseph was disbanded during the French Revolution. The convents and chapels of the community were confiscated in 1793. The Sisters were forced to choose between returning to their families or leaving France to join communities in other countries. Some Sisters who remained became martyrs. Three in Dauphiné and two in Haute-Loire were sent to the guillotine because they refused to take the Civil Oath. Others were imprisoned at St-Didier, Feurs and Clermont.\n\nThe congregation was re-established in 1807 by Mother Saint John Fontbonne in Lyon, France. As word of the Sisters' services and good deeds grew, dioceses throughout France requested the services of the restored Congregation. Houses were established in the dioceses of Lyon, Chambéry, Annecy, Gap, Bourg, and Bordeaux.\n\nIn 1902 many French houses of the congregation were closed by the Government, in consequence of which a large number of Sisters left for Denmark, Russia and the United States. In 1996 the Congregation of the Sisters of St. Joseph of Bourg re-joined the Sisters of St. Joseph of Lyon as part of the latter's European Province.\n\nThe center of the Congregation is in Rome. Other Provinces and Regions are located in Belgium, Bolivia, Brazil, Czech Republic, Denmark, France, Germany, Ireland, India, Italy, Mozambique, Norway, Pakistan, Sweden and Tanzania. The order has approximately 1,800 sisters in 18 countries.\n\nIn 1812 a colony of Sisters of St. Joseph was sent from Lyon to Chambéry, in Savoy, France under Mother St. John Marcoux. She in turn sent sisters to Turin and to Pignerole in the Piedmont, thus giving rise to new branches of Saint Joseph sisters. In 1843 Mother Félicité became Mother Superior. More than eighty houses rose under her direction, and when, in 1861, a state normal school was opened at Rumilly, Savoy, France. it was placed in charge of the sisters. Meanwhile, the Chambéry sisters had been constituted a diocesan congregation, but as years went on a stronger administration became necessary.\n\nThe rule was therefore revised to meet the requirements of a generalate, and papal approbation was granted in 1874 by rescript of Pius IX. Under the new form of government the congregation is subject to a Superior General, whose term of office is six years and is divided into provinces, each possessing a novitiate. The novices, after two years probation, make annual vows for two years, after which they bind themselves by perpetual vows. The rule is based on that of St. Augustine.\n\nIn 1819 a foundation from the motherhouse in Lyon was established in the Diocese of Belley under the leadership of Mother Saint Joseph Chaney. In 1823 the Sisters of that diocese formally separated from community in Lyon. They became a new and independent diocesan congregation under the leadership of Reverend Mother Saint Benoit Cornillon and the authority of Bishop Alexander Devie. Several other foundations spread from France throughout the world. In 1996 the Bourg congregation merged with the founding congregation of Lyon, as part of the latter's European Province.\n\nThe Congregation of the Sisters of St. Joseph of Annecy is an international congregation of about 500 sisters serving in the Congo, England, France, Gambia, India, Ireland, Senegal, Switzerland, Tanzania and Wales.\n\nIn 1833, an SSJ community was founded in Annecy. The new Congregation grew and developed, and their first mission in India was established in 1849. A provincial house and novitiate are located in Visakhapatnam (once known as Waltair), Andhra Pradesh.\n\nIn the summer of 1864, two Sisters of St Joseph of Annecy set out on a voyage from India to the UK to open a community in the small town of Devizes, Wiltshire, England. In 1946, Llantarnam Abbey in Wales was bought by the Sisters of St. Joseph and is home to a large community of Sisters. The Sisters farm the adjoining land. Llantarnam Abbey in Cwmbran, South Wales stands on the site of a medieval Cistercian monastery. The Tŷ Croeso ecumenical retreat centre adjoins the Abbey.\n\nThere are eight houses in the United Kingdom, under the provincial house and novitiate at Llantarnam Abbey. The congregation now numbers 60, in charge of 10 elementary day and boarding-schools, with an attendance of about 2000. In Scotland at St Mary's College, Blairs, 15 sisters have charge of the household arrangements and work of the college.\n\nOn March 19, 2015 the Bhubanwswar Province of the Sisters of St. Joseph of Annecy opened St. Joseph's Hospital in the city of Agartala, Tripura, India.\n\nThe Federation of the Sisters of Saint Joseph is a union of all the Sisters of Saint Joseph of the United States who claim a common origin in the foundation at LePuy, France in 1650. It was formed in 1966 and includes approximately 6,500 members of 16 Congregations throughout the United States.\n\nMember congregations are:\n\nThis congregation is composed of almost 1,200 vowed sisters who minister in four provinces and two vice provinces. The Congregational Center is located in Sunset Hills, a suburb of St. Louis, Missouri.\n\nIn the year 1834 Most Rev. Joseph Rosati, Bishop of St. Louis, Missouri, called at the mother-house of the Sisters of St. Joseph at Lyon and asked Mother St. John Fontbonne, the superior, to send a colony of sisters to America to undertake instruction of deaf-mute children. The financial aid necessary was obtained through the Countess de la Roche Jacquelin. The bishop accepted six sisters to instruct the children, and in addition, two others to teach the deaf.\n\nOn 17 January 1836 the first six sisters set sail from Le Havre, France on the ship \"Natchez\". After seven weeks at sea, they arrived in New Orleans March 5, where they were met by the Bishop of St. Louis and Rev. Timon, afterwards Bishop of Buffalo. Bishop Rosati had arranged for them to stay with the Ursuline Sisters in the city and met with them the next day. (He planned to travel north with them to St. Louis.) The sisters enjoyed the hospitality of the Ursulines for two weeks, learning much about life in the United States. The sisters also told them to disguise their religious habit when going abroad and while traveling to St. Louis as there was anti-Catholic feeling among some residents.\n\nThe sisters boarded the steamer, the \"George Collier\", traveled up the Mississippi and reached St. Louis on 25 March 1836. Through Holy Week the sisters resided with the Daughters of Charity, who had a hospital near the Cathedral. On April 7, three of the sisters, accompanied by Bishop Rosati and Father Fontbonne, travelled by boat for Cahokia, Illinois, a former French colonial town, where they opened a school for French and Creole settlers at the request of a Vincentian missionary. On September 12, the remaining sisters settled in a log cabin in the village of Carondelet, about five miles south of the city of St. Louis. At the time the sisters arrived at St. Louis, this humble house was occupied by the Sisters of Charity, who cared for a few orphans there who were soon transferred to a new building. Many institutions have been started from the origin of these sisters and continue their good works. St. Joseph Institute for the Deaf, St. Joseph’s Academy; Fontbonne College, now Fontbonne University, all were founded among the sisters at the convent at Carondelet.\n\nIn 1847 the first foundation outside St. Louis was made in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, followed shortly by foundations in Toronto, Ontario, Canada (1851); Hamilton, Ontario (1852); Wheeling, West Virginia (1853); and Canandaigua (1854); Flushing (Brentwood)(1856); Rochester; and Buffalo, all in New York state, which had received many Irish Catholic immigrants. In 1851 Bishop Joseph Cretin went to Carondelet to ask Mother Celestine to send the Sisters of St. Joseph to his new diocese in St. Paul, Minnesota; four sisters reached there by steamboat on 3 November. In 1853 Bishop McCloskey requested sisters for Cohoes, New York. On April 15, 1858, one German, one Irish, and two native-born sisters arrived by train in Oswego, New York in the midst of a snowstorm, to establish a school for Catholic immigrants. In 1869 the Flushing community sent three pioneer sisters to Ebensburg, Pennsylvania.\n\nBecause of the rapid growth of the institute and the increasing demand for sisters from all parts of the United States, the superiors of the community by 1860 had to figure out how to give stability and uniformity to the growing congregation. They called a general chapter in May 1860, to which representatives from every congregational house in America were called. Mother St. John Facemaz was elected first superior general for a term of six years. Shortly afterward, she traveled to Rome to present a copy of the Constitution for Vatican approval. In September 1863, Pope Pius IX issued a degree of commendation. Final approbation was received, dated May 16, 1877. This approval established the Sisters of St. Joseph of Carondelet as a congregation of pontifical right, and unified their communities in various dioceses with the mother-house at Carondelet (now part of St. Louis, Missouri).\n\nDuring the Civil War, the order sent nuns to serve as Army nurses. However, the head of Army nurses Dorothea Dix distrusted them; her anti-Catholicism and ignorance of the nuns undermined her ability to work with Irish and German sisters, whom she ridiculed as unfeeling. In 1910 the congregation divided into four provinces. The Sisters are known for their work in education and health care, and their activism in opposing the death penalty.\n\nThe Sisters of St. Joseph of Savannah were established at Savannah in 1867, in charge of the boys' orphanage, and soon afterward became an independent diocesan congregation. In 1876 the orphanage was transferred to Washington, Georgia, and with it the mother-house of the congregation. In 1912 the Sisters opened an academy for women in Augusta which became Mount Saint Joseph. They eventually moved the mother house to Augusta, Georgia. In 1922 the Sisters voted to incorporate themselves into the Sisters of Saint Joseph of Carondelet, becoming the Augusta Province.\n\nThe St. Louis, Missouri Province comprises the houses of the congregation in the Archdioceses of St. Louis and Chicago, and the Dioceses of St. Joseph, Kansas City, Indianapolis, Peoria, Belleville, Alton, Denver, Marquette, Green Bay, Mobile, and the Diocese of Oklahoma. The Sisters of St. Joseph of Georgia joined as a separate province in 1922 and became part of the St. Louis Province in 1961.\n\nIn St. Louis, Missouri the Sisters of St. Joseph of Carondelet St. Louis sponsor Saint Joseph Institute for the Deaf, Saint Joseph's Academy, Fontbonne University, and Ascension Health; and in Kansas City, Missouri, they sponsor Saint Teresa Academy and Avila University.\nIn 1851, four Sisters arrived in the village of St. Paul, Minnesota, to establish the Sisters of St. Joseph of Carondelet, St. Paul Province. A log cabin became the first site of Saint Joseph's Academy in early November 1851, a day and boarding school for girls. In 1853, in response to the cholera epidemic, the sisters turned the school into the first site of St. Joseph's Hospital, which was also the state of Minnesota's first hospital.\n\nThe growth of the St. Paul congregation began with the entrance of its first postulants, Ellen Ireland and her cousin Ellen Howard, in the summer of 1858. By then the pattern of response to need had been firmly set with the opening of St. Joseph Academy in St. Paul, Long Prairie Indian Mission, St. Anthony's School in Minneapolis, and St. Joseph Hospital and Cathedral School in St. Paul. Orphans were taken care of in all these institutions.\n\nIn 2016, the St. Paul Province celebrated its 175th year. Its ministries range from young adult spirituality to immigrant and refugee services. Through these ministries, St. Paul Sisters and Consociates strive to foster the common good through advocacy, creative arts, education, healthcare, social service, and spirituality.\n\nThe Albany Province (formerly Troy, New York) is formed of the houses established in the Dioceses of Albany and Syracuse, New York. The Albany Province of the Sisters of St. Joseph of Carondelet founded and sponsor the College of St. Rose, Albany, New York, named in honor of St. Rose of Lima, the first canonized saint in the Americas.\n\nLos Angeles is the youngest of the four provinces of the Congregation of St. Joseph of Carondelet. Already well known in the eastern part of the country with provinces established in St. Louis, St. Paul, and Albany, the Sisters of St. Joseph received an appeal from two pioneer bishops in the West. Santa Fe bishop John Baptist Lamy, and the newly installed bishop of Tucson, John Baptist Salpointe, wrote to Carondelet in the late 1860s asking for sisters to establish a school in Tucson, Arizona. \nSeven Sisters began the long journey to the west in April 1870, traveling on the newly completed transcontinental railroad to San Francisco, by steamer to San Diego, and by covered wagon across the American Desert to Tucson, Arizona. Their first school, the future St. Joseph’s Academy, opened on June 6, 1870, eleven days after their arrival in Tucson. \nMinistries spread rapidly from this early beginning with schools opening in Arizona and California. Close to the Sisters’ hearts was the education and care of their beloved Native Americans. By 1873, the Sisters had opened a school for the Papago Indians at San Xavier del Bac. Within a few years, they were ministering at Fort Yuma, St. Anthony’s in San Diego, St. Boniface School in Banning, and St. John’s Mission School in Komatke. \nWhen Bishop Salpointe opened St. Mary’s Hospital in Tucson in 1880, health care became an important part of the Sisters’ ministry. Over the years, the Sisters sponsored and operated hospitals in Arizona, California, Washington, and Idaho until recent developments in health care led them to transfer ownership and sponsorship to a Catholic health system. \nAs the majority of ministries increased in California, Los Angeles was selected as seat of the western province and established in 1903. Academies were established as early as 1882, Mount St. Mary’s College (now University) was founded in 1925, and Sisters were teaching in parish schools in five states. Work with the deaf, a treasured tradition since the first days in St. Louis, flourished for many years in Oakland and San Francisco. In 1925, the Sisters of St. Joseph of Lewiston, Idaho, joined the Carondelet congregation. In 2011, the Sisters of the Vice Province of Japan joined the Los Angeles Province as a region.\nFrom the first days in Arizona, education and health care merged naturally into other forms of care of the dear neighbor. Over the years, and especially after Vatican II, the Sisters’ work has expanded and diversified, including parish service, adult education, spiritual direction and retreat work, direct service of the poor, and justice activities.\nSponsored institutions:\nAcademy of Our Lady of Peace, San Diego\nCarondelet High School, Concord, CA\nSt. Joseph High School, Lakewood, CA (philosophical sponsorship)\nSt. Joseph Joshi Gakuen, Tsu, Japan\nSt. Mary’s Academy, Inglewood, CA\nMount St. Mary’s University, Los Angeles\nSt. Joseph Center, Venice, CA\nSelected province works:\nA Friendly Manor\nAlexandria House\nCircle the City\nGet on the Bus\nHouse of Yahweh\nVilla Maria House of Prayer\nThe congregation established foundations in Hawaii in 1938, in Japan in 1956 and in Peru in 1962. These have flourished and attracted native-born members. The Hawaii community became a vice-province in 1956, the Japan and Peru communities in 1978.\n\nThe superior general and four general councillors, elected every six years by the whole congregation, form the general governing body, assisted by a superior provincial and four provincial councillors in each province. The provincial officers are appointed by the general officers every three years, as are the local superiors of all the provinces.\n\nIn each provincial house, as in the mother-house, a novitiate is established. The term of postulantship extends from three to six months, the term of novitiate two years, after which annual vows are taken for a period of five years, when perpetual vows are taken. All are received on the same footing, all enjoy the same privileges, and all are subject to the same obedience which assigns duties according to ability, talent, and aptitude.\n\nAlthough an interchange of members of the various provinces is allowed and made use of for general or particular needs, the autonomy of each province is safeguarded. The constitutions, while establishing on a solid basis the idea of a general government, allow no small share of local initiative and carefully provide for local needs. In this way too much centralization or peril to establishments working in accordance with local and special exigencies is guarded against.\n\nIn 1847 the Sisters of St. Joseph of Carondelet, in response to an appeal of Bishop Kenrick, sent four members of the community to Philadelphia to take charge of St. John's Orphan Asylum, until that time under the Sisters of Charity. The Know-Nothing spirit, which had but a short time previously led to the Philadelphia riots was still rampant, and the sisters had much to suffer from bigotry and difficulties of many kinds. Shortly afterwards they were given charge of several parochial schools, and thus entered on what was to be their chief work in the coming years.\n\nIn October 1858, under the patronage of St. John Neumann, the congregation in Philadelphia began to take a more definite development by the establishment of a mother-house at Mount St. Joseph, Chestnut Hill. When the Sisters of St. Joseph of St. Louis formed a generalate in 1863 (approved later by the Holy See), the congregation of Philadelphia preserved its autonomy, by the wish of the bishop. When the number of religious members increased to between three and four hundred, and the works entrusted to them became so numerous and varied as to necessitate an organization more detailed and definite, steps were undertaken to obtain the papal approbation, which was received in 1895.\n\nDuring the Civil War, detachments of sisters nursed the sick soldiers in Camp Curtin and the Church Hospital, Harrisburg. Despite anti-Catholic sentiments from doctors and soldier-nurses who did not appreciate the sisters' presence, the sisters worked at the camp until its closure in April 1864. Shortly after, under Surgeon General Smith, they undertook more active duty on the floating hospital, Whilldin, which received the wounded from both sides at the battle of Yorktown, and other southern battle-fields.\n\nFor two thirds of the 1900s, the group supplied teachers to hundreds of elementary and secondary schools in the Philadelphia area, educating generations of children and young adults. The trademark white triangle that was worn as part of the sisters' veil was present until 1974. The changes in life style and ministry that were common in Catholic religious institutes of women in the late 1960s took a little longer to catch up with this group who held on to convent living in traditional parish settings as well as a modified habit and veil up to the mid-1980s.\n\nFrom a membership high of close to 2,500 is the mid-sixties, the current 2017 membership is under 750 with most of the membership in full or partial retirement. \n\nSisters of St. Joseph of Philadelphia sponsored institutions: Saint Joseph Academy McSherrystown, Pennsylvania; Mount Saint Joseph Academy (Flourtown, Pennsylvania); Villa St Joseph; Saint Mary By-The-Sea Retreat House in Cape May Point, New Jersey; Norwood-Fontbonne Academy; Holy Family Academy (Bayonne, NJ); SSJ Center for Spirituality Chestnut Hill, Philadelphia; Bethlehem Retirement Village, Flourtown, PA; Sisters of Saint Joseph Welcome Center, Philadelphia (Kensington), PA; and Chestnut Hill College, in Chestnut Hill, Pennsylvania\n\nThe Sisters of St. Joseph, Brentwood is an independent diocesan congregation. \nIn the spring of 1856 the Right Rev. John Loughlin, first Bishop of Brooklyn, applied to the mother-house at Philadelphia for sisters, and two religious were named for the new mission, joined during the same year by a sister from Buffalo. St. Mary's Academy, Williamsburg, was opened on September 8, 1856, and in the following year a parochial school was inaugurated. In 1860 the mother-house, novitiate, and boarding school were removed to Flushing, Long Island, whence the activity of the sisters was gradually extended over the diocese. In 1903 the mother-house and novitiate were again transferred to Brentwood, New York, where an academy was opened the same year.\n\nSisters of St. Joseph, Brentwood sponsor, among other ministries: Saint Joseph's College (New York), St. Joseph High School (Brooklyn), The Mary Louis Academy, Fontbonne Hall Academy, Sacred Heart Academy (New York), Bishop Kearney High School (New York City) and Academia Maria Reina\n\nIn 1869 the Sisters of St. Joseph, Brentwood, (then located in Flushing, New York) sent three pioneer sisters to Ebensburg, Pennsylvania: Sisters Hortense Tello, Xavier Phelan, and Sister Austin Keane, a native of nearby Loretto, Pennsylvania, who had been baptized by Father Demetrius Gallitzin, the pioneering priest in western Pennsylvania. Five days after their arrival in Ebensburg, the three St. Joseph Sisters opened a day-school and a boarding-school, Mount Gallitzin Seminary for Boys.\n\nIn 1902 a four-story school and convent to serve as both Mt. Gallitzin Academy and their new motherhouse was dedicated in Baden. Their original motherhouse in Ebensburg was remodeled into an infant home where they nurtured newborns and toddlers from 1923 to 1959.\n\nFrom 1926 to 1948, 15 Sisters of St. Joseph of Baden ministered in China. Their mission in Hunan Province included an orphanage and hospital. Sister Theresa Joseph Lung, a native of Hunan who entered the congregation in 1933, remained in China after the sisters left and died there in 1994. The community has sheltered refugees from Cuba, Haiti, Vietnam, Cambodia, Laos, Bosnia, and Kosovo, and has been instrumental in helping them find homes in this country. In 1997, the sisters started Girls they established a separate non-profit corporation to operate Villa St. Joseph, a non-sectarian, 120-bed, long-term care facility with a specialized unit for Alzheimer's patients.\n\nThe Sisters of St. Joseph of Baden number just under 200 women. They are chaplains, foster parents, and pastoral ministers; they include a lawyer, drug and alcohol interventionists, counselors, retreat directors, and college professors.\n\nIn 1873 four Sisters of St. Joseph of Brooklyn (now Brentwood) arrived at St. Thomas parish in Jamaica Plain. They found a city filled with new immigrants from Southern and Eastern Europe who had joined the earlier Irish immigrants. Four days after their arrival the sisters opened an elementary school for girls in the basement of the church. 200 students applied the first day. By 1877, with the acceptance of 30 boys, St. Thomas School became the first co-educational Catholic school in New England. In the Archdiocese of Boston, the sisters opened, staffed, and/or sponsored over 125 educational institutions, including schools for children with special needs.\n\nSisters of St. Joseph, Sister John Berchmans and Sister Elizabeth, were among those who volunteered to care for people during the influenza epidemic of 1918. During the Depression, they fed the hungry from their kitchen doors. In the 1950s, four Sisters of St. Joseph of Boston were missioned to New Mexico to teach in parish schools. Since that time sisters have ministered in Santa Rosa, Santa Fe, Albuquerque, Clovis, and Springer, New Mexico. San Ricardo Parish in Lima, Peru, became the home to a group of Sisters of St. Joseph of Boston in 1965.\nThe Sisters of St. Joseph of Boston sponsor:\nBethany Health Care Center and Bethany Hill School, both in Framingham, Massachusetts; Fontbonne Academy in Milton, MA; Jackson School and Walnut Park Montessori School in Newton, MA; Mount Saint Joseph Academy and Literacy Connection Literacy Connection in Brighton, MA; Merrimack Valley Montessori School Merrimack Valley Montessori School in Haverhill, MA; Regis College in Weston, MA; Casserly House in Roslindale, MA; and Saint Joseph Retreat Center in Cohasset, MA.\n\nThe mother-house is in Brighton.\n\nThe Sisters of St. Joseph were introduced into the Diocese of Buffalo in 1854, when three sisters from Carondelet, St. Louis, made a foundation at Canandaigua, New York. Two years later one of these sisters was brought to Buffalo by Bishop Timon to assume charge of Le Couteulx St. Mary's Institution for the instruction of deaf mutes, which had lately been established. The novitiate was removed from Canandaigua to Buffalo in 1861. The community developed rapidly and soon spread through different parts of the diocese. By 1868 the sisters were sufficiently strong to direct their own affairs, and elected their own superior, thus forming a new diocesan congregation. In 1891 the mother-house and novitiate were removed to the outskirts of the city, where an academy was erected.\n\nSisters of St. Joseph of Buffalo sponsor Mount Saint Joseph Academy in Buffalo.\n\nIn 1854 four Sisters of St. Joseph came from St. Louis, at the invitation of Bishop Timon of Buffalo, to Canandaigua, NY. In 1868, the Diocese of Rochester was created, and the community divided creating 2 communities, one in Buffalo and the other in Rochester, now with its own mother-house and novitiate at St. Mary's Boys' Orphan Asylum, later transferred to the Nazareth Academy, Rochester.\n\nThe Sisters of St. Joseph of Rochester sponsor Nazareth Schools; St. Joseph's Neighborhood Center; Daystar; the Sisters of Saint Joseph Volunteer Corps; St. Joseph's Northside Outreach and Prayer Ministry\n\nThe Sisters of St. Joseph of Erie were founded in 1860 by Mother Agnes Spencer of Carondelet, Missouri, who, with two other sisters, took charge of St. Ann's Academy at Corsica, Pennsylvania, where postulants were admitted. In 1864 a hospital was opened at Meadville, and the sisters took charge of the parochial schools of that city. Villa Maria Academy was opened in 1892 and in 1897 was made the novitiate and mother house of the Sisters of St. Joseph in the Erie diocese.\n\nAmong the sisters ministries are: Villa Maria Elementary School, Villa Maria Academy, Bethany House Ministry, The Heritage Apartments, Saint Vincent Health Center, Saint Mary's Home of Erie, SSJ Neighborhood Network, St. Patrick Haven, St. James Haven, and Faithkeepers Trail\n\nIn 1880 several sisters from the mother-house at Buffalo made a foundation at Watertown, New York, which was later strengthened by the accession of another sister from the Erie mother-house. Sister M. Josephine Donnelly, formerly of the Sisters of St. Joseph of Erie is considered by some to be the foundress of the Sisters of St. Joseph of Watertown., as she remained when other sisters moved on to start a foundation in Michigan. From Watertown as a centre missions were opened in other parts of the diocese.\n\nIn 1883 four Sisters of St. Joseph arrived at Newton, Kansas, from Rochester, New York, and opened their first mission. After remaining there a year they located at Concordia, Kansas, in the fall of 1884, and established the first motherhouse in the West, in what was then the Diocese of Leavenworth. The congregation has hospitals and schools in the Archdiocese of Chicago and the Dioceses of Marquette, Rockford, Kansas City, Omaha, Lincoln, and Concordia. The sisters currently so work in Brazil and New Mexico. Diocese of Concordia is now Diocese of Salina \n\nThe Sisters of St. Joseph of Concordia sponsor Nazareth Convent and Academy, Manna House; and From 1922 to 1989 the sisters also operated Marymount College.\n\nJane Sedgwick of Stockbridge, Massachusetts, desired to establish a Catholic school in Lee, Massachusetts. Since there weren't enough sisters in the United States to aid in the running of the school, Jane eventually went to Rome to appeal to Pope Leo XIII to send help. In 1885, five sisters of Saint Joseph of Chambéry arrived in Lee to open the school.\nThe novitiate was transferred to Hartford, Connecticut in 1898. The foundation spread into Connecticut and eventually into other parts of the United States.\n\nIn 2007, seven congregations of the Sisters of Saint Joseph in the central United States merged to form an entirely the new Congregation, which is now called the Congregation of Saint Joseph. The Congregation numbered about 700 as of 2011.\n\nIn 1854 Sisters were sent from the Sisters of St. Joseph of Bourg house in France to establish a house at Bay St. Louis, Mississippi, in the Diocese of Natchez. In 1863 a novitiate was opened at New Orleans. After establishing a central house in New Orleans, Louisiana, the Sisters extended their ministry to the poor and suffering of Louisiana and Mississippi, opening schools, hospitals and an orphanage.\n\nIn 1907, the group in Argyle, Minnesota established a convent and school in Crookston, Minnesota In 1907 a convent was established at Superior, Wisconsin by seven Sisters from Cincinnati. Schools have since been opened among the French Canadians in Minnesota and Wisconsin\n\nBy 1962, the Bourg Congregation had six provinces, three in Europe and three in the United States, with missions in Africa and Latin America. In July 1977, the six provinces voted to become two separate congregations, one based in Europe, the other in America. On November 30, 1977, Rome officially declared the three American provinces to be a new Congregation in the Church: the Sisters of Saint Joseph of Medaille. The name Medaille was chosen because it is the family name of the Jesuit priest who helped found the Sisters in 1650 and because the Sisters were geographically located in the north, central and southern areas of the United States. Sister Janet Roesener of Cincinnati, Ohio was chosen the first superior general.\n\nIn 1986 and in 1994 decisions were made to merge the three provinces into five regions headed by a Congregational Leadership Office consisting of a president and three general councilors, in Cincinnati. The five regions consist of Baton Rouge, Cincinnati, Crookston, Minnesota, New Orleans, and the Twin Cities.\n\nThe Sisters of St. Joseph of the Diocese of Cleveland are chiefly engaged in the parochial schools. The sisters currently support St. Joseph Academy in Cleveland, Ohio; River's Edge, Women's Outreach Center, Seeds of Literacy, WellSpring Bookstore and the CSJ Prayer Line.\n\nThe Sisters of St. Joseph were established in La Grange, Illinois, October 9, 1899, by two Sisters under Mother Stanislaus Leary, formerly superior of the diocesan community at Rochester, New York. On July 14, 1900, the cornerstone of the mother-house was laid. Currently the sisters sponsor Nazareth Academy, a Catholic co-educational high school in La Grange Park, Illinois. The school's four core values include Scholarship, Service, Spirit, and Unity.\n\nAmong the ministries sponsored by Sisters of St. Joseph of La Grange are the School on Wheels, Nazareth Academy, Ministry of the Arts, and Christ in the Wilderness\n\nIn 1889 Sisters of St. Joseph from the Diocese of Ogdensburg, New York established a new congregation at Kalamazoo, Michigan. The founding sisters came to Kalamazoo at the request of the Diocese of Detroit and Msgr. Francis O'Brien for the purpose of establishing a hospital, later named Borgess Hospital. At about the same time these first sisters, under the leadership of Mother Margaret Mary Lacy, began an orphanage and a school in addition to establishing their motherhouse at Nazareth on the outskirts of the city of Kalamazoo. The novitiate was transferred, in 1897, to Nazareth, a hamlet founded by the Sisters on a farm.\n\nAmong the institutions sponsored by the Sisters of St. Joseph of Nazareth are the Dillon Complex for Independent Living, Transformations Spirituality Center, Ascension Health and Our Lady of Guadalupe Middle School for Girls \n\nThe Sisters of St. Joseph of Tipton were founded in 1888 by Gertrude Moffitt at St. John the Baptist Parish in Tipton, Indiana. In 2016, the property owned by the Sisters in Tipton was sold to the Diocese and the few remaining sisters moved to other locations.\n\nThe sisters worked as teachers in a number of parish schools; opened and staffed St. Joseph Academy from 1892 until its closure in 1972; sponsored Good Samaritan Hospital and St. Joseph Hospital in Kokomo, Indiana (previously Howard County Hospital, now St. Vincent Kokomo Hospital), and started the Hospice St. Joseph mission in Port-au-Prince, Haiti (now administered by the Diocese of Norwich, CT.)\n\nIn 1853 seven sisters from Carondelet, Missouri, opened a private orphanage and hospital in Wheeling, and in 1856 took possession of a building chartered by the Assembly of Virginia for a hospital. From 19 October 1860, the community was independent of the St. Louis mother-house. During the Civil War the hospital was rented by the Government and the sisters enrolled in government service. After the war and the reorganization of the hospital on its present lines, the sisters extended their activities to various parts of the diocese.\n\nThe motherhouse was included in the Mount Saint Joseph listing on the National Register of Historic Places, added in 2008.\n\nThe Sisters of St. Joseph of Wheeling sponsor the SSJ Health and Wellness Foundation, the SSJ Charitable Fund and a variety of programs under Holy Family Child Care & Development.\n\nIn 1883, Mother Stanislaus Leary of Rochester, New York stopped in Kansas en route to Arizona, and opened a mission which would develop into the Sisters of St. Joseph of Concordia. In August 1887, four Sisters of St. Joseph were commissioned to go from Concordia, Kansas, to open a parochial school at Abilene, Kansas, at that time in the Roman Catholic Diocese of Leavenworth. In the fall of 1887, word was received from Rome that the state of Kansas had been divided into dioceses. At the direction of Bishop Fink, who did not wish to lose the sisters from his diocese, the Abilene sisters constituted themselves a separate congregation with an act of incorporation of March 25, 1888. The following year the Right Rev. L. M. Pink, Bishop of Leavenworth, decided that these Sisters should belong to his diocese exclusively, and in so doing they became the nucleus of a new diocesan congregation of the Sisters of St. Joseph, having their motherhouse established at Abilene, under the title of Mount St. Joseph's Academy.\n\nThe congregation increased in numbers and soon branched out, doing parochial school work throughout the diocese. In 1892 the name of the Diocese of Leavenworth was changed to Kansas City, Kansas, and for the time being the Sisters of St. Joseph were diocesan Sisters of the Roman Catholic Diocese of Kansas City. In 1896, when the re-division of the three Kansas dioceses, was begun, Bishop Fink of Kansas City, had their motherhouse transferred from Abilene to Parsons. But after the division was made the following year, Parsons was in the Wichita diocese, and the mother-house of the Sisters of St. Joseph being in Parsons, the congregation belonged to the Wichita Diocese, having mission-houses in both the Diocese of Concordia and the Diocese of Kansas City. In 1907 a colony of these Sisters opened a sanitarium at Del Norte, Colorado, in the Diocese of Denver.\n\nIn 1950, the congregation responded to the need for medical services in Kyoto, Japan. Three sisters began a mission which today sponsors a kindergarten, day nursery, medical services for senior citizens, a disabled children's hospital, and a special education school.\n\nAt the close of the American Civil War, the most Reverend Augustin Verot, Bishop of Savannah and Administrator Apostolic of Florida, visited his native city of LePuy where he challenged the Sisters of St. Joseph to come to St. Augustine. Many sisters volunteered. The chosen eight were Sister Marie Sidonie Rascle, Superior: and Sisters Marie Julie Roussel, Marie Josephine Deleage, Marie Clemence Freycenon, St. Pierre Borie, Marie Joseph Cortial, Julie Clotilde Arsac, and Marie Celenie Joubert. They arrived in Florida at Picolata Landing on the shores of the St. Johns River, September 2, 1866.\n\nThe sisters from France adjusted heroically to a different language, culture, and climate with joy and faith. They welcomed new members as they mourned the disproportionate number of those who succumbed to disease and unhealthy conditions. At the direction of Bishop Verot, the sisters were sent to six missions throughout Florida and Georgia. Their primary ministry was to black people. Owing to the departure of the Sisters of Mercy from the city, the education of the whites also devolved on the new community.\n\nBy 1876 the sisters in Georgia had been separated from those in France, but the sisters in Florida were established as a province of LePuy. At the close of the century, provincial government was abruptly terminated by Bishop John Moore. This brought about the establishment of the Diocesan Congregation of the Sisters of Saint Joseph of St. Augustine, Florida, in 1899.\nTo maintain their charitable works and to provide self-support, the sisters erected academies. These institutions served as centers of catechetical work until they were relinquished and replaced by parochial and diocesan schools. The sisters augmented their resources by such means as lace-making and private lessons in art, music, and language.\n\nDuring the years of rapid expansion in the developing Church of Florida, and with the support of Archbishop Joseph P. Hurley, the majority of the sisters gave their time to education, which included instruction of students who were deaf, blind, developmentally disabled, or otherwise handicapped. Gradually they became more involved in the multi-faceted aspects of health care; and they assumed work with the aging, unwed mothers, and migrants. The Congregation opened schools in Puerto Rico in the fifties. Two decades later in 1976, the sisters in Puerto Rico became an independent institute.\n\nThe Sisters of St. Joseph of Orange is among the youngest of the American congregations and traces its roots through the St. Joseph congregations of La Grange, Illinois; Concordia, Kansas; Rochester, New York; and Carondelet, Missouri.\n\nThe Sisters of St. Joseph of Orange were established in 1912 by Mother Bernard Gosselin. She and eight sisters left LaGrange, Illinois, near Chicago to establish what is now St. Bernard's High School in Eureka, California. As the Congregation grew, the Sisters were better able to address more of the needs of the area. The 1918 flu pandemic presented a new challenge to the community. The Sisters responded as best they could at the time, but they realized that by establishing a hospital they could provide a health care service which would effectively address the personal, social and spiritual needs of the area. In 1920, the Sisters opened St. Joseph Hospital in Eureka. Today the hospital is by far the largest medical facility on Coastal California north of its even larger medical facility located in Santa Rosa, California, as well as others in Southern California.\n\nBy 1922, the Sisters were teaching in several Southern California areas and recognized that the community could better develop its ministries by moving the Motherhouse to Orange. The first ministries of the Sisters of St. Joseph of Orange were in education and health care. Schools and hospitals were staffed primarily by the Sisters and in the 1940s and 1950s the number of institutions directed by the Congregation increased steadily. In the 1940s the Sisters extended their work in health, education and religious instruction to the people of Papua New Guinea and Australia.\n\nToday, the Congregation’s commitment to education is expressed in a variety of forms including elementary, secondary, university and other adult education. The commitment to extend their healing mission is expressed through acute care hospitals, rehabilitation programs, home health care, community education, primary care clinics, and wellness programs. The works of the Congregation have expanded, however, beyond education and health care to also include such things as helping new immigrants, feeding the hungry, giving shelter to the homeless, and fostering spiritual development.\n\nThe Sisters of St. Joseph of Orange are one of three sponsoring religious communities of Loyola Marymount University in Los Angeles. They also have a special partnership with the Western American Province of the Religious of the Sacred Heart of Mary dating back to the 1968 signing of the Marymount Accords when St. Joseph's College of Orange merged with Marymount College of Los Angeles and assumed the Marymount name. Five years later, Marymount College merged with Loyola University of Los Angeles as the school assumed its current name, Loyola Marymount University.\n\nSisters of St. Joseph of Orange sponsor the following institutions: École Notre-Dame-des-Victoires, San Francisco; Loyola Marymount University, Los Angeles; Mission Hospital, Mission Viejo; Queen of the Valley Medical Center, Napa; St. Jude Medical Center, Fullerton; and Rosary High School, Fullerton (1965–1976).\n\nIn 1906 Father Joseph Forest requested of the Sisters of St. Joseph to come to the Diocese of Portland, Maine. With the bishop's approval, eight Sisters made their way to Maine where they would staff a parochial school and a girls' boarding school in Jackman. The need was for bilingual teachers and none of the Sisters were familiar with English. They made haste to learn words and expressions so they could communicate with the children. At the time of their arrival, there were approximately 80 families in Jackman, mostly of Canadian origin so they spoke French. Children came from miles around, even from Canada, to be educated by the Sisters. Many of the children went home only at the end of the school year because of transportation and harsh weather. A second group of Sisters came into Maine in 1909, this time in South Berwick. The site of the convent was the former Paul's Hotel, where Lafayette had stayed on one of his trips to the United States. The Sisters became known primarily for their education apostolate in the diocese.\n\nThe Sisters in Maine maintained their link with the Motherhouse in Lyon, France through frequent correspondence as well as the regular canonical visits from the Mother General or one of her assistants. Only in 1958, as the number of Sisters increased sufficiently to establish a Province in Maine did the Congregation appoint a provincial superior.\n\nIn September 1880, seven Sisters of St. Joseph were sent from Flushing, Long Island, to take charge of a parochial school at Chicopee Falls, Massachusetts. They were followed, two years later, by seven Sisters for Webster, and in 1883 by twelve more for the cathedral parish school in Springfield. In 1885 the Springfield mission was constituted the motherhouse of an independent diocesan congregation.\n\nAmong the ministries sponsored by the Sisters of St. Joseph of Springfield are Mont Marie Child Care Center, Mont Marie Health Care Center, Inc, Mont Marie Senior Residence, and Mont Marie Labyrinth.\n\nAs of 2015, there were about 250 Sisters the Springfield Congregation continuing to serve through a variety of ministries.\n\nIn 1902 nine Sisters of St. Joseph from the mother-house at Le Puy took charge of the school in the French parish of St-Roch, Fall River, Massachusetts. The accession of other members from the mother-house enabled the community to take charge of three other schools in the city attached to French parishes. In 1906 St. Theresa's Convent was formally opened as the provincial house of the community, which was legally incorporated in the same year, and a novitiate was established. In the mid 1970s, the Sisters of St. Joseph of Fall River merged with the Springfield Congregation.\n\nIn 1873 the Rev. Charles Boylan of Rutland (town), Vermont petitioned the mother-house of the Sisters of St. Joseph at Flushing, Long Island, for sisters to take charge of his school. Several sisters were sent, and a novitiate was opened at Rutland on October 15, 1876. The Sisters of Saint Joseph founded Mount Saint Joseph Academy. In 2001, Sisters of St. Joseph of Rutland, Vermont joined the Springfield community which also covers Worcester, the Berkshires, Rhode Island and even Louisiana and Uganda.\n\nOn September 20, 1966, the six separate Canadian congregations: Toronto, Hamilton, London, Peterborough, Pembroke and Sault Ste. Marie, formed the Canadian Federation.\n\nThe mother house of the Sisters of St. Joseph at Toronto was established from Le Puy, France, in 1851 by Mother Delphine Fontbonne and three other Sisters of St. Joseph of Philadelphia. They took charge of an already established orphanage at 100 Nelson Street (now Jarvis). The city was filled with Irish immigrants who had fled the ravages of famine at home, and the Sisters attended to the needs of orphans, widows and people who were sick and dying.\n\nFor many years, the mother house was at Morrow Park in north Toronto. The sisters taught in many schools across Canada since their establishment in the country. In Toronto, some of their schools included: St. Joseph's Morrow Park Catholic Secondary School, St. Joseph's College School, St. Joseph's Islington, and St. Joseph's Commercial. They also established St. Michael's Hospital and St. Joseph's Hospital, and for many years ran the Sacred Heart Orphanage and the House of Providence for poor persons, among many other charities. In higher education, the sisters established St. Joseph's College in the University of St. Michael's College.\n\nTheir current mother house is on O'Connor Drive in Toronto, and their works continue under the mantle of Fontbonne Ministries.\n\nIn 2012, four congregations (Hamilton, London, Peterborough and Pembroke) decided to come together to form a new congregation – The Congregation of the Sisters of St. Joseph in Canada.\n\nThe first Sisters of St. Joseph in Canada came to Toronto from the Sisters of St. Joseph of Philadelphia, in the fall of 1851. In 1852 five sisters from the mother-house at Toronto established a foundation at Hamilton, where they at once opened an orphanage and began their work in the parochial schools of the city. On the erection of the Diocese of Hamilton in 1856, the community became a separate diocesan congregation, and a few months later a novitiate was established at Hamilton. By the passage of the Separate Schools Bill in 1856 the sisters were given control of the education of the Catholic children of the city. The congregation gradually extended its activities to other parts of the diocese. The Neighbour to Neighbour Program, St. Joseph’s Women’s Immigrant Centre and Hamilton Out of the Cold are but three more recent (25 years) local initiatives where the Sisters have been instrumental in the start-up.\n\nThe community of Sisters of St. Joseph at London was founded in 1868 by five sisters from the Sisters of St. Joseph of Toronto. These sisters opened an orphan asylum the following year in 1867. On 18 December 1870, the congregation became independent, with a novitiate of its own. Sister Ignatia Campbell was appointed Superior General in 1870 and held office until 1902. On 15 February 1871, the Sisters of St. Joseph of London, Ontario, were legally incorporated. Several missions were opened in various parts of the diocese, and in 1888 a hospital was established at London, to which was attached a training school for nurses.\n\nIn 1890, at the request of Bishop R.A. O'Connor, Bishop of Peterborough, twenty sisters of the Toronto congregation formed a new congregation in the diocese of Peterborough. Mother Austin Doran was elected General Superior. The sisters staffed the newly opened St. Joseph’s Hospital in Peterborough. In 1895 the congregation began its teaching apostolate in the city of Peterborough. A House of Providence was established in 1900 to accommodate not only the elderly poor but orphans of the diocese.\n\nIn 1921, in response to a request from Bishop Ryan for teachers to staff the rural areas of the Ottawa Valley schools, twenty-seven Sisters of St. Joseph of Peterborough from three mission houses located in the diocese of Pembroke, formed into a new congregation with the motherhouse in Pembroke. In 1946, they opened their first hospitals and Homes for the Aged in western Canada. By 1964, they were able to establish a mission in Peru which is still operating today with a growing community of Peruvian Sisters. The Sisters of St. Joseph of Pembroke sponsor the Stillpoint House of Prayer\n\nIn 1936 120 Sisters of St. Joseph of Peterborough became founding members of the new congregation in the diocese of Sault St. Marie.\n\n\nThe Sisters of St. Joseph of Saint-Vallier were instituted in 1683 at Saint-Vallier, France, by the Abbey of Saint-Vallier, who would later become Quebec City’s second bishop. They had originally been part of the large Congregation of St. Joseph that was founded in 1650 at Puy en Velay. Upon the creation of their order, the Sisters took charge of the small hospital in Saint-Vallier. The congregation survived the French Revolution because of its small size and state of destitution. But the Combes Laws (1901 and 1904) closed the schools of the religious communities and forbade the sisters from teaching. One sister who had come from Quebec, Thérèse de Jésus (Cécile Drolet), suggested to the Mother General that the congregation find a new home in Canada. She was sent to Quebec City in April 1903 and presented a request to Monsignor Bégin, who approved the congregation’s move to his diocese.\n\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "24176725", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=24176725", "title": "Starfish Project", "text": "Starfish Project\n\nThe Starfish Project is a UK-based not-for-profit therapy programme which helps people who stammer or stutter to overcome their speech through the use of diaphragmatic breathing (also known as \"costal breathing\"). The programme also teaches participants to reassess negative emotions surrounding their stammering through the use of avoidance reduction therapy (see stuttering therapy). \n\nParticipants attend a three-day residential course near Hailsham in the UK during which a diaphragmatic breathing technique and non-avoidance strategies are taught. Following this initial course, participants are able to attend additional follow-up courses at the same venue without charge from the Starfish Project as often as they feel necessary. Course participants are also encouraged to make use of a list of phone contacts of other course participants and can attend free support meetings at various locations around the UK. \n\nAnne Blight, founder of the Starfish Project, has been working with people who stammer for many years, first as a volunteer with the Association for Stammerers in the UK, then with its successor organisation The British Stammering Association. Anne Blight was previously involved in the early days of McGuire Programme before founding the Starfish Project in 1998.\n\nIn 2016, the Starfish Project announced its first courses outside of the UK. The Starfish Project had been invited to start courses for people who stammer in the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) countries. Courses are scheduled quarterly in Dubai with instruction in English and monthly at various cities within the GCC countries with instruction in Arabic. \n\nAlthough diaphragmatic breathing may be an effective way for people who stammer to manage their condition, it should not be regarded as a cure and, while anecdotally effective, the existence of beneficial outcomes for people who stammer from diaphragmatic breathing-based therapies such as the Starfish Project is not supported by specific peer-reviewed research.\n\nA similar breathing technique is used by several other stammering treatment initiatives including the programme offered by the Del Ferro Institute in Amsterdam (where the application of diaphragmatic breathing to stammering was first developed) and the McGuire Programme.\n\n"}

Strasburg, 110 P. 1020 (Wash. 1910), was a case decided by the Washington Supreme Court that held that a statute eliminating the insanity defense was unconstitutional.

Lawyers saw the Strasburg case as an opportunity to have the Washington law that forbade insanity defenses declared unconstitutional. The effect of the Supreme Court declaring the law unconstitutional was said to be expected to reverse the convictions of \"scores\" of people.\n"}
{"id": "36969812", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=36969812", "title": "Suicide in Guyana", "text": "Suicide in Guyana\n\nSuicide in Guyana is a serious social problem, as Guyana is ranked first in suicides per capita worldwide.\n\nAbout 40% of people who commit suicide in Guyana poison themselves by consuming agricultural pesticides.\nThe most famous case of suicide in Guyana was the mass suicide of over 900 members of Jim Jones' Peoples Temple in 1978, although some sources regard the events as a mass murder.\nAlthough this occurred in Guyana, the leader of this cult along with the followers were all foreigners and not Guyanese nationals.\n\nDomestic data on suicide in Guyana is limited, as the country's available health literature is focused mainly on infectious tropical diseases. A 2012 World Health Organization report indicated that Guyana had a suicide rate of 44.2 per 100,000 people, and that for every single female suicide, there were 3.2 male suicides. By comparison, neighboring Suriname had a suicide rate of 27.8 per 100,000, and Venezuela's rate was 2.6 per 100,000.\n\nEthnic Indians have been seen to make up the vast majority of suicides in Guyana, though their share of overall suicides dropped from 85% in 2004 to 75% in 2009. The ethnic groups categorized as \"other\" were seen to make up most of the difference. Indians accounted for 48% of all deaths in both years, which is 4% higher than their population share.\n\nA 2003 World Bank report stated that the political process in Guyana is often fought with so much time and energy that \"little [is] left to undertake the many policies necessary to facilitate growth and development,\" while the IMF in 2001 acknowledged \"poor governance\" as a major obstacle to the reduction of absolute poverty rates, which are among the highest in the region. Poor governance on the national level has led to inefficiencies and strained the abilities of local and regional authorities to provide basic services and guarantee rule of law. Distribution of land and water rights, payment of taxes, court cases, and the issuance of gun and driver's licenses are all frequently found to be fraudulent. This basic ill-governance has fed a sense of mistrust and frustration among the population, reduced investments in constructive economic projects, and has led to the growth of a shadow economy. This in turn has lowered tax revenues, further reducing the government's spending power and ability to fight poverty and repair basic infrastructure. However, the role of economic insecurity as a leading factor in suicide rates remains a controversial issue in Guyana.\n\nAnother factor is the rate of HIV/AIDS in the country, which is third-highest in the Caribbean region. Several studies have reported an association between HIV/AIDS and suicidal ideation.\n\nAttempts by the government to address the issue have been stymied by political divisions. A bill was voted down in 2016 which would have amended the country's laws in order to decriminalize suicide, implemented the 2014 Mental Health Strategic Plan and a 5-year National Suicide Prevention Plan which were both crafted by the previous government, and allocated funds to treat mental health and suicide as national priorities. Speakers for the parliamentary majority argued that the manner in which the legislation was framed both politicized and trivialized the issue.\n\n"}
{"id": "4351910", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=4351910", "title": "Suitcase Clinic", "text": "Suitcase Clinic\n\nThe Suitcase Clinic is a humanitarian student organization that has offered free services and supplies to the uninsured, homeless and low-income communities of Berkeley, California and the San Francisco Bay Area since 1989. The organization strives to promote the health and overall well-being of underserved individuals through service provision, cooperative learning, empowerment, and collective action among community and professional volunteers, students, and participants. Its three clinics operate at the First Presbyterian Church of Berkeley, the St. Mark's Episcopal Church, and the Dwight Way Women's Shelter.\n\nStudents of the organization plan, manage, and carry out all clinic operations. Its student-centered model has inspired the formation of other student-run free clinics such as the UCSD Student-Run Free Clinic Project and the UCLA Mobile Clinic.\n\nFounded in the summer of 1989 by a group of first year students of the UC Berkeley–UCSF Joint Medical Program, the Suitcase Clinic was formed to provide specialized services to a population which was receiving inadequate health care. Originally a mobile clinic traveling by van directly to the clients, the present organization now operates out of three drop-in centers, and is structured around the principles of public health, social welfare, community activism and empathy. The organization embodies a holistic view of health, considering physical, mental, emotional and social well-being as equally necessary.\n\nStaffed on an entirely volunteer basis by a variety of students and professionals from throughout the Bay Area, the organization is administered by undergraduates, with policy decided upon through consensus via the central Planning Committee legislative organ. Participating undergraduates are either currently enrolled in, or have already completed, a training and certification course offered by the Health and Medical Sciences Program at the University of California, Berkeley. Medical students operate out of the five-year UCB–UCSF Joint Medical Program, and optometry students hail from the UC Berkeley School of Optometry at Minor Hall. Professionals from within both the city of Berkeley, CA and the university cooperate with these students in order to offer medical, chiropractic, legal, and social assistance to a largely homeless and low-income clientele.\n\nThe fundamental agents of the Suitcase Clinic are the undergraduate caseworkers, who serve as advocates for clients. They are responsible for recording the social history of their client, and for ensuring that their client has received the services desired. Additional roles include establishing and maintaining positive relationships, making referrals to other agencies, providing follow-ups, fostering a non-judgmental social environment, and taking an active interest in the welfare of the client and community. Services currently offered by the three drop-in centers include health care, medication, physical examinations, hygienic supplies, vision screening, legal counsel, meals, footwashing, chiropractic, hair cutting and massage therapy.\n\nThe Suitcase Clinic is an umbrella organization comprising five unique subdivisions:\n\nThe General Clinic is the oldest of the Suitcase Clinic's three drop-in centers, and receives up to forty clients per night on average. Clients often walk for hours daily and have limited access to showering facilities. Here, they can receive feet washing, podiatry, nail clippers, emery boards, antifungal creams and sprays, and clean socks. Dental services consist of teeth cleanings, and chiropractic services provide adjustments given by professionals. Haircutting is performed by students, who also dispense general health education and referrals for housing and insurance. Legal counsel, generally pertaining to overdue warrants, landlord–tenant disputes, and applying for financial assistance, is provided by volunteers from the East Bay Community Law Center. Medical services offer basic care and education, on-site treatment, health consultations, referrals, and free influenza vaccinations during the flu season. Medication and supplies can be issued at the discretion of the on-site physician if necessary. Optometry services perform preliminary eye examinations for clients, and if glasses are necessary, they can be provided to the client at no cost.\n\nThe Women's Clinic opened during the fall of 1996 with the intent of further reaching out to the low-income, homeless, neglected, and abused women and children who had previously formed a minority at the General Clinic. This branch offers unique resources such as homeopathy, manicure, and children's services, and cares for roughly thirty clients per night on average.\n\nThe Youth Clinic is the most recently established drop-in center, having opened in September 2000. It is tailored specifically towards the Bay Area's homeless and street-identified youth, and popular resources include acupuncture, regularly held dinners, and arts and crafts. The city of Berkeley is a frequent destination for disenfranchised and neglected youth, due to the city's long history of social activism and inclusiveness. Despite this image, there are few actual resources available within the city to serve the specific needs of hard-to-reach street-identified youth, due in part to a reluctance amongst this population to deal with the bureaucratic intake and formal processing methods of traditional institutions. The city of Berkeley estimates that youth between the ages of thirteen and twenty-three account for 100–200 of the homeless population within the city, and youth living on the street are extremely vulnerable to suicide, HIV/AIDS, sexually transmitted infections, traumatic injury, infectious diseases such as tuberculosis, hepatitis B, hepatitis C, teenage pregnancy, asthma and infestations .\n\nSHARE, an acronym for \"Searching How to Achieve Respect and Empowerment\", was officially launched in May 1996. It is a discussion and advocacy group with the goal of strengthening the solidarity of the Suitcase Clinic's diverse community . Led by trained student facilitators, SHARE provides a uniquely open forum, allowing clientele to discuss current affairs and exchange opinions with student volunteers through presentations, movies, community participation and political action.\n\nHealth and Medical Science (HMS) 98/198 is a course offered at UC Berkeley which provides the training requisite for the operations in the three clinics. The class is entirely organized and run by student volunteers. Students delve into topics of public health, in social welfare, in cultivating empathy and compassion, and in working with the homeless or other underserved populations. The first six weeks cover caseworker training, and the remainder of the semester is spent addressing specific topics such as drug and alcohol abuse, mental health, and personal accounts of homelessness.\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "1543486", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1543486", "title": "Third plague pandemic", "text": "Third plague pandemic\n\nThird Pandemic is the designation of a major bubonic plague pandemic that began in Yunnan province in China in 1855. This episode of bubonic plague spread to all inhabited continents, and ultimately more than 12 million people died in India and China, with 10 million people killed in India alone. According to the World Health Organization, the pandemic was considered active until 1960, when worldwide casualties dropped to 200 per year.\n\nThe name refers to this pandemic being the third major bubonic plague outbreak to affect European society. The first was the Plague of Justinian, which ravaged the Byzantine Empire and surrounding areas in 541 and 542. The second was the Black Death, which killed at least one third of Europe's population in a series of expanding waves of infection from 1346 to 1353.\n\nCasualty patterns indicate that waves of this late-19th-century/early-20th-century pandemic may have been from two different sources. The first was primarily bubonic and was carried around the world through ocean-going trade, through transporting infected persons, rats, and cargoes harboring fleas. The second, more virulent strain, was primarily pneumonic in character with a strong person-to-person contagion. This strain was largely confined to Asia, in particular Manchuria and Mongolia.\n\nThe bubonic plague was endemic in populations of infected ground rodents in central Asia, and was a known cause of death among migrant and established human populations in that region for centuries. An influx of new people due to political conflicts and global trade led to the distribution of this disease throughout the world.\n\nA natural reservoir or nidus for plague is located in western Yunnan and is an ongoing health risk today. The third pandemic of plague originated in this area after a rapid influx of Han Chinese to exploit the demand for minerals, primarily copper, in the latter half of the eighteenth century. By 1850, the population had exploded to over 7 million people. Increasing transportation throughout the region brought people in contact with plague-infected fleas, the primary vector between the yellow-breasted rat (Rattus flavipectus) and humans. People brought the fleas and rats back into growing urban areas, where small outbreaks sometimes reached epidemic proportions. The plague spread further after disputes between Han Chinese and Hui Muslim miners in the early 1850s erupted into a violent uprising known as the Panthay rebellion, which led to further displacements (troop movements and refugee migrations). The outbreak of the plague helped recruit people into the Taiping Rebellion. In the latter half of the nineteenth century the plague began to appear in Guangxi and Guangdong provinces, Hainan Island, and later the Pearl River delta including Canton and Hong Kong. While William McNeil and others thought that the plague was brought from the interior to the coastal regions by troops returning from battles against the Muslim rebels, Benedict suggests that the evidence favors the growing and lucrative opium trade that began after about 1840.\n\nIn the city of Canton, beginning in March 1894, the disease killed 60,000 people in a few weeks. Daily water-traffic with the nearby city of Hong Kong rapidly spread the plague. Within two months, after 100,000 deaths, the death rates dropped below epidemic rates, although the disease continued to be endemic in Hong Kong until 1929.\n\nPlague came to British India in 1896, most likely from Hong Kong where the epidemic had been festering since 1894. Over the next thirty years, the country would lose 12.5 million people to the disease. Almost all cases were bubonic, with only a very small percentage changing to pneumonic plague. (Orent, p. 185) The disease was initially seen in port cities, beginning with Bombay (now Mumbai), but later emerged in Pune, Kolkata, and Karachi (now in Pakistan). By 1899, the outbreak spread to smaller communities and rural areas in many regions of India. Overall, the impact of plague epidemics was greatest in western and northern India—in the provinces then designated as Bombay, Punjab, and the United Provinces—while eastern and southern India were not as badly affected.\n\nThe colonial government's measures to control the disease included quarantine, isolation camps, travel restrictions and the exclusion of India's traditional medical practices. Restrictions on the populations of the coastal cities were established by Special Plague Committees with overreaching powers, and enforced by the British military. Indians found these measures culturally intrusive and, in general, repressive and tyrannical. Government strategies of plague control underwent significant changes during 1898–1899. By that time, it was apparent that the use of force in enforcing plague regulations was proving counter-productive and, now that the plague had spread to rural areas, enforcement in larger geographic areas would be impossible. At this time, British health officials began to press for widespread vaccination using Waldemar Haffkine’s plague vaccine, although the government stressed that inoculation was not compulsory. British authorities also authorized the inclusion of practitioners of indigenous systems of medicine into plague prevention programs.\n\nRepressive government actions to control the plague led the Pune nationalists to criticise the government publicly. On 22 June 1897, the Chapekar brothers, young Pune Hindus, shot and killed Walter Charles Rand, an Indian Civil Services officer acting as Pune Special Plague Committee chairman, and his military escort, Lieutenant Ayerst. The action of the Chapekars was seen as terrorism. The government also found the nationalist press guilty of incitement. Independence activist Bal Gangadhar Tilak was charged with sedition for his writings as editor of the Kesari newspaper. He was sentenced to eighteen months rigorous imprisonment.\n\nPublic reaction to the health measures enacted by the British Indian state ultimately revealed the political constraints of medical intervention in the country. These experiences were formative in the development of India's modern public health services.\n\nThe network of global shipping ensured the widespread distribution of the disease over the next few decades. Recorded outbreaks include:\n\nEach of these areas, as well as Great Britain, France, and other areas of Europe, continued to experience plague outbreaks and casualties until the 1960s. The last significant outbreak of plague associated with the pandemic occurred in Peru and Argentina in 1945.\n\nResearchers working in Asia during the \"Third Pandemic\" identified plague vectors and the plague bacillus. In 1894, in Hong Kong, Swiss-born French bacteriologist Alexandre Yersin isolated the responsible bacterium (\"Yersinia pestis\") and determined the common mode of transmission. In 1898, French researcher Paul-Louis Simond demonstrated the role of fleas as a vector.\n\nThe disease is caused by a bacterium usually transmitted by the bite of fleas from an infected host, often a black rat. The bacteria are transferred from the blood of infected rats to the rat flea (\"Xenopsylla cheopsis\"). The bacillus multiplies in the stomach of the flea, blocking it. When the flea next bites a mammal, the consumed blood is regurgitated along with the bacillus into the bloodstream of the bitten animal. Any serious outbreak of plague in humans is preceded by an outbreak in the rodent population. During the outbreak, infected fleas that have lost their normal rodent hosts seek other sources of blood. The bacterium that causes this disease, \"Yersinia pestis\", was named after Yersin. His discoveries led in time to modern treatment methods, including insecticides, the use of antibiotics and eventually plague vaccines.\n\nThe British colonial government in India pressed medical researcher Waldemar Haffkine to develop a plague vaccine. After three months of persistent work with a limited staff, a form for human trials was ready. On January 10, 1897 Haffkine tested it on himself. After the initial test was reported to the authorities, volunteers at the Byculla jail were used in a control test, all inoculated prisoners survived the epidemics, while seven inmates of the control group died. By the turn of the century, the number of inoculees in India alone reached four million. Haffkine was appointed the Director of the Plague Laboratory (now called Haffkine Institute) in Bombay.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2010280", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2010280", "title": "Vision therapy", "text": "Vision therapy\n\nVision therapy (also known as vision training, or VT) is used to improve vision skills such as eye movement control, eye coordination, contrast sensitivity, and perception. It primarily focuses on improving visual skills in amblyopia and many binocular vision anomalies including accommodative disorders, vergence disorders, eye movement disorders, and the training of stereopsis. VT involves a series of procedures carried out in both home and office settings, usually under professional supervision by an Optometrist. Orthoptics is a similar discipline, but primarily involves exercises which work on eye alignment for patients with strabismus. Many strabismic surgeons have an orthoptist in-house.\n\nVision therapy can be prescribed when a comprehensive eye examination indicates that it is an appropriate treatment option. The specific program of therapy is based on the results of standardized tests and the person's signs and symptoms. Programs typically involve eye exercises and the use of lenses, prisms, filters, occluders, specialized instruments, and computer programs. The course of therapy may last weeks to several years, with intermittent monitoring by the eye doctor.\n\nVision therapy encompasses a wide variety of non-surgical methods to treat disorders of vergence (eye crossing and un-crossing), accommodation (eye focusing and un-focusing), and eye movements (pursuits and saccades). Vergence and accommodation influence each other through the \"Accommodative Convergence / Accommodation\" (AC/A) pathway, so disorders of accommodation can often be related to disorders of vergence and vice versa. Disorders of accommodation and vergence can lead to eyes which appear too crossed or too uncrossed under ordinary situations, eyes which have extra trouble focusing or unfocusing (accommodative hysteresis) under ordinary circumstances, or eyes which feel abnormally strained (asthenopia) when performing tasks that most people have no trouble with.\n\nAccommodative Disorders include:\n\nVergence Disorders include:\n\nPursuit & Saccadic Eye Movements Disorders include:\nSaccadic eye movement disorders can be quantified by visual therapists with tests such as the King-Devick Test, The Developmental Eye Movement (DEM) Test, and the NSUCO Occulomotor Test.\n\n\nAmblyopia (when the brain never learns how to use an eye, also known as a \"lazy eye\") is a condition which optometric and ophthalmological traditions generally agree upon and both treat similarly. Amblyopia, which can also often lead to eyes which do not attend well to visual targets (strabismus, a \"turned eye\") until the brain can learn to use that eye. Ambloypia is treatable with glasses and eye patching (or drops, sometimes called \"wet patching\"), to give the best correctable vision possible to the amblyopic eye while blurring the better-seeing eye so that the brain must be forced to use the amblyopic eye (\"break suppression\") and develop good vision for it. Children, whose brains are still neuroplastic, have better outcomes after amblyopia treatment than adults. Rarely, a child with amblyopia may also have developed a condition known as anomalous sensory correspondence (or [[anomalous correspondence), where the child has learned to attend to visual targets using a part of the retina which is not the central fovea.\n\nThere is a long-standing and heated controversy between ophthalmologists and optometrists about which visual conditions can be treated, how best to treat them, the extent to which the certain visual tasks impact a person's life, and how effective vision therapy can be at improving higher-level functions such as coordination and cognition. This has led to several different philosophies and approaches to training the visual system, as well as several branches of alternative medicine. While both ophthalmological and optometric journals have published peer-reviewed studies on therapies and outcomes, ophthalmological journals have tended to lump alternative medicine practices in with optometric practices. To add further confusion, some vocal proponents of alternative medicine practices have been optometrists.\n\nThere exist a few different broad classifications of vision treatment philosophies, which have been traditionally divided between Optometrists, Ophthalmologists, and practitioners of alternative medicine:\n\nOrthoptics is a field pertaining to the evaluation and treatment of patients with disorders of the visual system with an emphasis on binocular vision and eye movements. Commonly practiced by [[orthoptists]], [[optometrists]], behavioral optometrists, [[Pediatric ophthalmology|pediatric ophthalmologists]], and general [[ophthalmologists]], traditional orthoptics addresses problems of [[asthenopia|eye strain]], visually induced [[headaches]], [[strabismus]], [[diplopia]] and visual related skills required for [[reading (process)|reading]].\n\n\nOrthoptics aims to treat [[binocular vision]] disorders such as [[strabismus]], and [[diplopia]]. Key factors involved include: Eye Movement Control, Simultaneous Focus at Far, Sustaining Focus at Far, Simultaneous Focus at Near, Sustaining Focus at Near, Simultaneous Alignment at Far, Sustaining Alignment at Far, Simultaneous Alignment at Near, Sustaining Alignment at Near, Central Vision (Visual Acuity) and Depth Awareness.\n\nSome of the exercises used are:\n\nThere is widespread acceptance of orthoptic therapy indications for:\n\nBehavioral VT aims to treat problems including difficulties of visual attention and concentration, which behavioral optometrists classify as visual information processing weaknesses. These manifest themselves as an inability to sustain focus or to shift focus from one area of space to another. Some practitioners assert that poor eye tracking may impact reading skills, and suggest that vision training may improve some of the visual skills helpful for reading.\n\nBehavioral Vision Therapy is practiced primarily by optometrists who specialize in the area. Historically, there has been a difference in philosophy among optometry and medicine regarding the efficacy and relevance of vision therapy: Major organizations, including the [[International Orthoptic Association]] and the [[American Academy of Ophthalmology]] have concluded that there is no validity for clinically significant improvements in vision with Behavioral Vision Therapy, and therefore do not practice it. However, major optometric organizations, including the [[American Optometric Association]], the [[American Academy of Optometry]], the [[College of Optometrists in Vision Development]], and the [[Optometric Extension Program]], support the assertion that non-strabismic visual therapy does address underlying visual problems which are claimed to affect learning potential. These optometric organizations are careful to distinguish, though, that vision therapy does not directly treat learning disorders.\n\nVision therapy treatment aims to train: Gross Visual-Motor skills, Fine Visual-Motor skills, Visual Perception, Peripheral Vision, Contrast & Color Perception.\n\nSome of the exercises in VT involve the use of:\n\nIn 1988, a review of 238 scientific articles was published in the \"Journal of the American Optometric Association\" widely defined vision therapy as \"a clinical approach for correcting and ameliorating the effects of eye movement disorders, non-strabismic binocular dysfunctions, focusing disorders, strabismus, amblyopia, nystagmus, and certain visual perceptual (information processing) disorders.\" - and thereby did not discriminate between orthoptic and behavioral visual therapy. The paper was positive about vision therapy generally: \"It is evident from the research that there is scientific support for the efficacy of vision therapy in modifying and improving oculomotor, accommodative, and binocular system disorders, as measured by standardized clinical and laboratory testing methods for patients of all ages for whom it is properly undertaken and employed.\"\n\nA more recent (2005) review concluded less positively that: \"Less robust, but believable, evidence indicates visual training may be useful in developing fine stereoscopic skills and improving visual field remnants after brain damage. As yet there is no clear scientific evidence published in the mainstream literature supporting the use of eye exercises in the remainder of the areas reviewed, and their use therefore remains controversial.\"\n\nIn 2006, noted neurologist [[Oliver Sacks]] published a case study about \"Stereo Sue\", a woman who had regained her [[stereo vision]], absent for 48 years, after undergoing vision therapy. The article was published in \"[[The New Yorker]]\" magazine, which is fact-checked but not peer-reviewed, very few details were given of the exact therapies used and the article discussed only one case of [[stereopsis recovery]]. However, the woman described by Sacks, [[Susan R. Barry|Susan Barry]], a neurobiology professor at Mt. Holyoke College, subsequently published a book, \"Fixing My Gaze.\" The book discusses multiple case histories and details the therapy procedures and the science underlying them.\n\nA systematic review of the literature on the effects of vision therapy on visual field defects published in 2007 concluded that it was unclear to what extent patients benefited from [[vision restoration therapy]] (VRT) as \"no study has given a satisfactory answer.\" The authors concluded that \"scanning compensatory therapy\" (SCT) seemed to provide a more successful rehabilitation, and simpler training techniques, therefore they recommended SCT until the effects of VRT could be defined.\n\nA 2008 review of the literature concluded that \"there is a continued paucity of controlled trials in the literature to support behavioral optometry approaches. Although there are areas where the available evidence is consistent with claims made by behavioral optometrists ... a large majority of behavioral management approaches are not evidence-based, and thus cannot be advocated.\"\n\nOther than for [[strabismus]] (such as intermittent [[exotropia]]) and [[convergence insufficiency]], the consensus among \"ophthalmologists\", \"orthoptists\" and \"pediatricians\" is that non-strabismic visual therapy lacks documented evidence of effectiveness. In 1998, the [[American Academy of Pediatrics]], [[American Academy of Ophthalmology]], and [[American Association for Pediatric Ophthalmology and Strabismus]] issued a policy statement regarding the use of vision therapy specifically for the treatment of \"learning problems\" and \"dyslexia.\" According to the statement: \"No scientific evidence exists for the efficacy of eye exercises ('vision therapy')... in the remediation of these complex pediatric neurological conditions.\" More recently, in 2004, the American Academy of Ophthalmology released a position statement asserting that there is no evidence that vision therapy retards the progression of \"[[myopia]]\", no evidence that it improves visual function in those with \"[[hyperopia]]\" or \"[[Astigmatism (eye)|astigmatism]],\" or that it improves \"vision lost through disease processes.\" This was also supported by the International Orthoptic Association.\n\nThe Joint Statement mentioned above was criticised at the time by Merrill Bowan, a vision therapy enthusiast, for being biased, with the author of a rebuttal concluding \"The AAP/AAO/AAPOS paper contains errors and internal inconsistencies. Through highly selective reference choices, it misrepresents the great body of evidence from the literature that supports a relationship between visual and perceptual problems as they contribute to classroom difficulties.\". The author also states that the Joint Statement presents an unsupported opinion by implication that Optometrists claim that vision therapy cures the learning problem. A similar criticism could be leveled at the 2004 American Academy of Ophthalmology paper which implies that vision therapy is claimed to treat \"vision lost through disease processes\". There is a common theme that critics of vision therapy seem to do by placing vision therapy under the same banner with alternative therapies. By implication, the lack of evidence for the alternative therapies is cited as a lack of evidence for vision therapy. No supporting evidence is given that vision therapy is actually used to treat eye disease or vision lost through disease processes.\n\nSome optometrists take a slightly different view. In 1999 a joint statement by the [[American Academy of Optometry]], the [[American Optometric Association]], the [[College of Optometrists in Vision Development]] and [[Optometric Extension Program|Optometric Extension Program Foundation]] reported: \"Many visual conditions can be treated effectively with spectacles or contact lenses alone; however, some are most effectively treated with vision therapy...Research has demonstrated that vision therapy can be an effective treatment option for \"ocular motility problems, non-strabismic binocular disorders, strabismus, amblyopia, accommodative disorders (and) visual information processing disorders.\"\"\n\nPractitioners in Behavioral optometry (also known as \"functional optometrists\" or \"optometric vision therapists\") practice methods that have been characterized as a [[alternative medicine|complementary alternative medicine]] practice. A review in 2000 concluded that there were insufficient controlled studies of the approach and a 2008 review concluded that \"a large majority of behavioural management approaches are not evidence-based, and thus cannot be advocated.\"\n\nThe consensus among Ophthalmologists, Orthoptists and Pediatricians is that \"visual training\" in non-strabismic Behavioural Vision therapy lacks documented scientific evidence of effectiveness. Although Ophthalmologists and Orthoptists believe that exercises can improve [[binocular vision]] control, they believe it does not purely improve monocular [[visual acuity]] such as that in [[amblyopia]] (rather, occlusion is the therapy of choice), change a person's [[refractive error]]. It is probable that they do not change the accommodative/convergence ratio nor change the amplitude of accommodation to postpone or delay [[presbyopia]]. It has been considered that they are unlikely to a person to develop the ability for [[stereopsis]]; nonetheless recent [[Stereopsis recovery#Stereopsis following training procedures|experimental investigations into dedicated perceptual learning exercises]], inspired by Barry's recovery of stereopsis, have shown some promise.\n\nBehavioral optometry is a branch of optometry that explores how visual function influences a patient's day-to-day activities. Vision therapy is a subset of behavioral optometry. In general, vision therapists attempt to improve vision, and therefore day-to-day [[well-being]], of patients using \"eye exercises,\" prism, and lenses, with more emphasis on the patient's visual function. Among schools of medicine, ophthalmology does not see merit in the procedures surrounding many of behavioral optometry's practices, arguing that there have not been enough studies of high enough merit to warrant practicing of vision therapy.\n\nIn a 2008, vision scientist Brendan Barrett published a review of behavioral optometry at the invitation of the UK [[College of Optometrists]]. Barrett wrote that behavioral optometry was not a well-defined field but that it was sometimes said to be an \"extension\" to optometry, taking a [[holistic]] approach: practitioners of the therapy use techniques outside mainstream optometry to \"influence the visual process\". Barrett discussed these techniques under ten headings:\n\n\nBarrett noted the lack of published controlled trials of the techniques. He found that there are a few areas where the available evidence suggest that the approach might have some value, namely in the treatment of convergence insufficiency, the use of yoked prisms in neurological patients, and in vision rehabilitation after brain disease or injury—but he found that in the other areas where the techniques have been used, the majority, there is no evidence of their value. In contrast, [[Steven Novella]] points out that the only condition that there is good quality scientific evidence for is convergence disorders. This points out a problem that is common with Complementary or integrative medicine, a type of [[Alternative medicine]], is that a promising use for treating a single disorder is applied to a wide range of disorders for which there is no evidence.\n\nThe eye exercises used in vision therapy can generally be divided into two groups; those employed for \"strabismic\" outcomes and those employed for \"non-strabismic\" outcomes, to improve eye health. \nOphthalmologists and orthoptists do not endorse these exercises as having clinically significant validity for improvements in vision. Usually, they see these perceptual-motor activities being in the sphere of either [[speech therapy]] or [[occupational therapy]].\n\nSome of the exercises used are\n\nThe eye exercises used in Behavioural Vision Therapy, also known as Developmental Optometry is practiced primarily by Behavioural Optometrists. Behavioral Vision Therapy aims to treat problems including difficulties of visual attention and concentration, which may manifest themselves as an inability to sustain focus or to shift focus from one area of space to another.\n\nSome of the exercises used are:\n\nFusional Amplitude and Relative Fusional Amplitude training\n\nCertain [[do-it-yourself]] eye exercises are claimed by some to improve [[visual acuity]] by reducing or eliminating [[refractive errors]]. Such claims rely mainly on [[anecdotal evidence]], and are not generally endorsed by orthoptists, ophthalmologists or optometrists. Chinese school children always do eye exercises twice per day during school, which are compulsory. They are also part of other forms category's as they are also [[do-it-yourself]] exercises although quite a few scientists say that they actually harm the children's eyes\n\nThe German optician [[Hans-Joachim Haase (optician)|Hans-Joachim Haase]] developed a method to correct an alleged misalignment. His method, called the \"[[MKH method]]\", is not recognized as an evidence-based approach.\n\nBehavioral optometry is largely based on concepts which lack plausibility or which contradict mainstream [[neurology]], and most of the research done has been of poor quality. As with [[chiropractic]], there seems to be a spectrum of scientific legitimacy among practitioners: at one extreme there is some weak evidence in support of the idea that myopia may be affected by eye training; at the other extreme are concepts such as \"syntonic phototherapy\" which proposes that differently colored lights can be used to treat a variety of medical conditions.\n\nA review in 2000 concluded that there were insufficient controlled studies of the approach. In 2008 Barrett concluded that \"the continued absence of rigorous scientific evidence to support behavioural management approaches, and the paucity of controlled trials in particular, represents a major challenge to the credibility of the theory and practice of behavioural optometry.\"\n\nBehavioral optometry has been proposed as being of benefit for children with [[Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder]] and [[autism]] – this proposal is based on the idea that since people with these conditions often have abnormal eye movement, correcting this may address the underlying condition. Evidence supporting this approach is however weak; the [[American Academy of Pediatrics]], the [[American Academy of Ophthalmology]] and the [[American Association for Pediatric Ophthalmology and Strabismus]] have said that learning disabilities are neither caused nor treatable by visual methods.\n\nBehavioral optometry is considered by some optometrists to have its origins in [[Orthoptics|orthoptic]] vision therapy. However, Vision therapy is differentiated between strabismic/orthoptic vision therapy (which many Optometrists, [[Orthoptist]]s and [[Ophthalmologist]]s practice) and non-strabismic vision therapy. [[A.M. Skeffington]] was an American [[optometrist]] known to some as \"the father of behavioral optometry\". Skeffington has been credited as co-founding the [[Optometric Extension Program]] with E.B. Alexander in 1928.\n\nA review in 2000 concluded that there were insufficient controlled studies of the approach and a 2008 review concluded that \"a large majority of behavioral management approaches are not evidence-based, and thus cannot be advocated.\"\n\nPractitioners of sports vision training claim to be able to enhance the function of a current athlete's vision beyond what is expected in individuals with already healthy visual systems..\n\nAlternative vision therapies include methods that some patients feel subjectively help them. Many optometrists and ophthalmologists are skeptical of the efficacy of these methods and practices, though some have been found to have at least a basis in studied principles to some limited degree (such as syntonics and [[melanopsin]], TBI and tinted lenses, and the adoption of EMDR by the VA Hospital in the USA).\n\nSome physicians are skeptical about the efficacy of \"vision therapy\" stating that it lacks data and is mostly anecdotal. In 2009, the American Academy of Pediatrics along with the American Academy of Ophthalmology \"essentially declared war\" on developmental optometry, as Judith Warner wrote in a New York Times article. Even within the field of optometry the U.K. College of Optometrists noted the \"Continued absence of rigorous scientific evidence to support behavioral management approaches\" in the second college of Optometrists report. The American Academy of Pediatrics is also critical of behavioral optometry. In 2009 it reviewed 35 years of the literature in support of vision therapy and issued a statement — in conjunction with other ophthalmological associations — condemning the therapy and its contention that it could help with learning disabilities. Visual problems, it claimed, are not the basis for learning disabilities. It issued a stern warning about the seductions of treatments that sound convincing but aren’t based on science: \"Ineffective, controversial methods of treatment such as vision therapy may give parents and teachers a false sense of security that a child’s learning difficulties are being addressed, may waste family and/or school resources and may delay proper instruction or remediation.\" The website by the American Association for Pediatric Ophthalmology and Strabismus states: \"Behavioral vision therapy is considered to be scientifically unproven\" and \"There is no evidence that vision therapy delays the progression or leads to correction of myopia.\"\n\nVarious forms of visual therapy have been used for centuries. The concept of vision therapy was introduced in the late nineteenth century for the non-surgical treatment of [[strabismus]]. This early and traditional form of vision therapy was the foundation of what is now known as [[orthoptics]].\n\nIn the first half of the twentieth century, orthoptists, working with [[ophthalmologists]], introduced a variety of training techniques mainly designed to improve binocular function. In the second half of the twentieth century, vision therapy began to be used by optometrists and paramedical personnel to treat conditions ranging from uncomfortable vision to poor reading and academic performance. It has also been claimed specifically to improve eyesight, and even to improve athletic performance.\n\nAt the beginning of the twenty-first century, most vision therapy is done by optometrists, while traditional orthoptics continues to be practiced by orthoptists and ophthalmologists. Based on assessments of claims and studies of published data, ophthalmologists claim that, except for near point of convergence exercises, vision therapy lacks documented evidence of effectiveness.\n\n\n[[Category:Alternative medical treatments]]\n[[Category:Vision]]\n[[Category:Therapy]]\n[[Category:Optometry]]\n[[Category:Eye procedures]]"}

The stopping of the train itself is also referred to as a \"water stop\". The term originates from the times of steam engines when large amounts of water were essential. Also known as wood and water stops or coal and water stops, since it was reasonable to replenish engines with fuel as well when adding water to the boiler. \n\nDuring the very early days of steam locomotives, water stops were necessary every 7–10 miles (11-16 km) and consumed much travel time. With the introduction of tenders (a special car containing water and fuel), trains could run 100–150 miles (160–240 km) without a refill. \n\nTo accumulate the water, water stops employed water tanks, water towers and tank ponds. The water was initially pumped by windmills, watermills, or by hand pumps often by the train crew themselves. Later, small steam and gasoline engines were used.\n\nAs the U.S. railroad system expanded, large numbers of tank ponds were built by damming various small creeks that intersected the tracks in order to provide water for water stops. Largemouth bass were often stocked in tank ponds.\n\nMany water stops along new railways evolved into new settlements. When a train stopped for water and was positioned by a water tower, the boilerman swung out the spigot arm over the water tender and \"jerked\" the chain to begin watering. This gave rise to a 19th-century slang term \"Jerkwater town\" for towns too insignificant to have a regular train station. Some water stops grew into established settlements: for example, the town of Coalinga, California, formerly, \"Coaling Station A\", gets its name from the original coal stop at this location. On the other hand, with the replacement of steam engines by diesel locomotives many of the then obsolete water stops, especially in deserted areas, became ghost towns.\n\nIsolated water stops were among favorite ambush places for train robbers.\n\n"}
{"id": "24081997", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=24081997", "title": "Weather pains", "text": "Weather pains\n\nWeather pains, weather-related pain, or meteoropathy is a phenomenon that occurs when people with conditions such as arthritis or limb injuries claim to feel pain, particularly with changes in barometric pressure, humidity or other weather phenomena. Scientific evidence, however, does not support a connection between weather and arthritic pain and concludes that it is largely or entirely due to perceptual errors such as confirmation bias. The term is from Greek \"meteora\", celestial phenomena, and \"pathos\", feeling, pain, suffering.\n\nThe perceived relationship between changes in weather and pain has been recorded since the classical Roman age. Hippocrates was the first to note, in about 400 B.C., that many illnesses were related to changes in season. The large body of folklore about how weather affects pain is reflected by traditional sayings and expressions, such as \"aches and pain, coming rains,\" \"feeling under the weather,\" and \"ill health due to evil winds.\"\n\nThe first publication of documented changes in pain perception associated with the weather was in the \"American Journal of the Medical Sciences\" in 1887. This case report described a person with phantom limb pain who concluded that \"approaching storms, dropping barometric pressure and rain were associated with increased pain complaint.\" Most investigations examining the relationship between weather and pain have studied people diagnosed with arthritis. After reviewing many case reports, Rentshler reported in the \"Journal of the American Medical Association\" in 1929 that there was strong evidence that \"warm weather is beneficial and barometric pressure changes are detrimental to patients with arthritis.\"\n\nCountering the 1929 barometric pressure claim, in a 2016 article entitled \"Do Your Aches, Pains Predict Rain?\" professor of atmospheric sciences Dennis Driscoll is reported as stating: \"People need to realize that the pressure changes associated with storms are rather small.\" In fact, Driscoll observes that the changes associated with a storm are about equivalent to what a person experiences in going up an elevator in a tall building. So far, there have not been many reports of people with arthritis hobbled by elevator rides in the medical literature.\n\nA study published in the \"British Medical Journal\" in 2017 examined reports of joint or back pain from millions of doctor visits between 2008 and 2012 as recorded by Medicare, the U.S. health system for the elderly. It compared these to rain data as recorded by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, but found no correlation.\n\nThe word \"meteoropathy\" is uncommon in English, but the concept and similar words are widespread in certain other languages. In Polish a sufferer is a \"meteoropata\", in Italian a \"meteoropatico\", in Croatian a \"meteoropat\",Macedonian a \"метеопат (meteopat)\", and Japanese a for example.\n"}
