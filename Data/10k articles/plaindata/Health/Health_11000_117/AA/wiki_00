It is typically associated with anxiety, stress, depression, and mental anguish, and can severely affect one's ability to function socially. Although many people suffer from indecision, it is rarely to the extent of obsession. The part of the brain that is tied to making rational choices, the prefrontal cortex, can hold several pieces of information at any given time. This may quickly overwhelm somebody when trying to make decisions, regardless of the importance of that decision. They come up with reasons that their decisions will turn out badly, causing them to over-analyze every situation critically in a classic case of paralysis by analysis. Lack of information, valuation difficulty, and outcome uncertainty can become an obsession.\n"}

{"id": "1573182", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1573182", "title": "Behavior change (public health)", "text": "Behavior change (public health)\n\nBehavior change, in the context of public health, refers to efforts to change people's personal habits to prevent disease. Behavior change in public health is also known as social and behavior change communication (SBCC). More and more, efforts focus on prevention of disease to save healthcare care costs. This is particularly important in low and middle income countries, where health interventions have come under increased scrutiny because of the cost.\n\nThe 3-4-50 concept outlines that there are 3 behaviors (poor diet, little to no physical activity, and smoking), that lead to four diseases (heart disease/stroke, diabetes, cancer, pulmonary disease), that account for 50% of deaths worldwide. This is why so much emphasis in public health interventions have been on changing behaviors or intervening early on to decrease the negative impacts that come with these behaviors. With successful intervention, there is the possibility of decreasing healthcare costs by a drastic amount, as well as general costs to society (morbidity and mortality). A good public health intervention is not only defined by the results they create, but also the number of levels it hits on the socioecological model (individual, interpersonal, community and/or environment). The challenge that public health interventions face is generalizability: what may work in one community may not work in others. However, there is the development of HealthyPeople 2020 that has national objectives aimed to accomplish in 10 years to improve the health of all Americans.\n\nHealth conditions and infections are associated with risky behaviors. Tobacco use, alcoholism, multiple sex partners, substance use, reckless driving, obesity, or unprotected sexual intercourse are some examples. Human beings have, in principle, control over their conduct. Behavior modification can contribute to the success of self-control, and health-enhancing behaviors. Risky behaviors can be eliminated including physical exercise, weight control, preventive nutrition, dental hygiene, condom use, or accident prevention. Health behavior change refers to the motivational, volitional, and action based processes of abandoning such health-compromising behaviors in favor of adopting and maintaining health-enhancing behaviors. Addiction that is associated with risky behavior may have a genetic component.\n\nOne emerging concept in the American health system is that of small, manageable changes. It is not necessary to make sweeping, drastic alterations to one's whole lifestyle in order to see benefit. Dietary and exercise contexts in particular show the benefit of moderate, slow changes. For example, behavior change steps to include more physical activity can improve one's life expectancy, control weight, and boost mental health. It is also known to reduce the chance of some diseases such as type 2 diabetes, cardiovascular disease, and some cancers. Healthy behaviors and practices during youth, particularly in school settings, is far more cost-effective than waiting until unhealthy behaviors are entrenched. A study of the Toward No Tobacco program, which was designed to prevent cigarette use among middle and high school students, found that for every dollar invested in school tobacco prevention programs, almost $20 in future medical care costs would be saved.\n\nBehavior change programs tend to focus on a few behavioral change theories which gained ground in the 1980s. These theories share a major commonality in defining individual actions as the locus of change. Behavior change programs that are usually focused on activities that help a person or a community to reflect upon their risk behaviors and change them to reduce their risk and vulnerability are known as interventions. Examples include: \"Transtheoretical (Stages of Change) Model of Behavior Change\", \"theory of reasoned action\", \"health belief model\", \"theory of planned behavior\", diffusion of innovation\", and the health action process approach. Developments in health behavior change theories since the late 1990s have focused on incorporating disparate theories of health behavior change into a single unified theory.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBehavior change communication, or BCC, is an approach to behavior change focused on communication. It is also known as social and behavior change communication, or SBCC. The assumptions is that through communication of some kind, individuals and communities can somehow be persuaded to behave in ways that will make their lives safer and healthier. BCC was first employed in HIV and TB prevention projects. More recently, its ambit has grown to encompass any communication activity whose goal is to help individuals and communities select and practice behavior that will positively impact their health, such as immunization, cervical cancer check up, employing single-use syringes, etc.\n\n\n\n\n"}

Ten years later, in 2000, the new hospital wing worth €25 million was built on the Western part of the small island that belongs to the city of Lindau.\nThe new building was built directly on the shores of Lake Constance in park-like surroundings. In 2003, the building’s extension was finished and opened as a private clinic which specialized in plastic and aesthetic surgery. Nowadays, the Bodenseeklinik features 50 beds on two wards, five operating rooms, one auditorium and a research lab. Currently, it is the biggest private clinic for aesthetic surgery in Europe.\n\nThe Bodenseeklinik follows a “gentle path to beauty”, and all doctors work and teach according to this principle. Mang and his team always stress the importance of preserving both health and the natural looks of the patients. The „Mang School“ believes in the motto \"Less is more\". Following this motto the director, Prof. Mang published the book a Manual of Aesthetic Surgery which features the current trend towards more gentle surgical methods.\nAs a training hospital, the clinic features one lecture hall.

It is expected to facilitate global trade and the harmonised communication of hazard information of chemicals and to promote regulatory efficiency. It complements the 2006 Registration, Evaluation, Authorisation and Restriction of Chemicals (REACH) Regulation (EC No 1907/2006) and replaces the current system contained in the Dangerous Substances Directive (67/548/EEC) and the Dangerous Preparations Directive (1999/45/EC).\n\nThe European Unions 2008 \"Classification, Labelling and Packaging\" regulation incorporates the classification criteria and labelling rules agreed at the UN level, the so-called Globally Harmonised System of Classification and Labelling of Chemicals (GHS). It introduced new classification criteria, european hazard symbols (pictograms) and Risk and Safety Statements for labelling, while taking into account elements which were part of the prior EU legislation.\n\nThe regulation requires companies to appropriately classify, label and package their substances and mixtures before placing them on the market. It aims to protect workers, consumers and the environment by labelling that reflects a particular chemical's possible hazards. It also addresses the notification of classifications, the establishment of a list of harmonised classifications and the creation of a classification and labelling inventory, as required by REACH.\n\nThe regulation came into force in January 2009. Manufacturers and importers had already pre-registered more than 140,000 substances with the European Chemicals Agency under the REACH Regulation. They had until 1 December 2010 to propose \"provisional classifications\" for these substances, which have been used for the labelling of pure substances since that date. The deadline for classifying mixtures was 31 May 2015. The deadline for re-labelling and re-packaging of products already on the market was two years later: 1 June 2017.\n\nIn 2008, Directive 2008/112/EC and regulation (EC) No 1336/2008 adapted classification-based provisions in other existing EU legislation (“downstream legislation”) to the new rules.\nPursuant to article 53 of the CLP Regulation, in 2009 a first adaptation to the technical and scientific progress (ATP) was made with Commission Regulation 790/2009.\n\n"}

If there is a possibility that the cascade effect will have a negative impact on the system, it is possible to analyze the effects with a consequence/impact analysis. Cascade effects are commonly visualised in tree structures, also called event trees.\n\nCascade effects seen in the perspective of space travelling are theoretical possibilities that \"space junk\" or a satellite destroyed by a meteor will send debris throughout the orbits of most telecommunication satellites destroying them in the process and subsequently sending that debris into all possible orbits, destroying everything in orbit around the Earth, known as the Kessler syndrome. It is theorized that if this occurs, space flight beyond Earth will become very difficult if not impossible.\n\nIn biology, according to Mold and Stein, the term cascade refers to \"a process that, once started, proceeds stepwise to its full, seemingly inevitable, conclusion\". The main cause of a cascade of injury in medicine is by misdiagnosis and medical error. These result in iatrogenic injury and from medical error flows a cascade of effects and results often including pain, disability, loss of job, poverty and homelessness which obviously cause mental health problems and may cause death. In medicine, a cascade effect may also refer to a chain of events initiated by an unnecessary test, an unexpected result, or patient or physician anxiety, which results in ill-advised tests or treatments that may cause harm to patients as the results are pursued. An example would be ordering a full body CT scan without a clear reason, finding an incidentaloma and undergoing a debilitating surgery to remove it, despite the fact that the condition was asymptomatic and possibly benign.\n\nThere is also an ecological definition of cascade effects, in which the death of one key species in an ecosystem triggers the extinction of other species.\n"}

The administration of botox and restylane is based on each respective state's dental board approval.\n\nThe American Dental Association notes that the consumer media have coined the term “dental spa,” but many practices offer services and amenities specifically designed to relax patients without considering themselves a “spa.” The loose definition of “dental spas” makes it difficult if not impossible to know how many dental spas exist in the United States.\n\nIn 2003, Lynn Watanabe, DDS of the Dental Spa in Pacific Palisades, California, and the Day Spa Association defined a dental spa as \"a facility whose dental program is run under the strict supervision of a licensed Oral Health Care Provider, which might be a Dentist or an Independent Dental Hygienist. Services are provided that integrate both traditional and non-traditional dental and spa treatments (such as massage therapy, skincare and body treatments).\" \n\nAncient civilizations such as the Greeks and Chinese all used certain methods to relax a person suffering from ailments such as a toothache. The \"barber surgeon\" in the 18th and 19th century allowed barbers to perform some dental procedures as well as shaves and haircuts. The term \"spa dentistry\" (synonymous to dental spa) was used in the 18th century to describe dental practitioners in Bath England. Ms. Curris, a female dentist in 18th Century Bath England likely created the first dental spa offering patients dentistry with skin and bodycare.\n\nThe terms, “dental spa” and “spa dentistry,” began to be more publicly used in the late 1990s. In 1998, Lorin Berland DDS, reserved the name DallasDentalSpa.com.\n\n1994 London's \"The Guardian\" has identified the Atlanta Center for Cosmetic Dentistry as \"one of the first of these new dental spas.” The February 19, 2007 reported that Debra Gray King, DDS, began providing spa services at the Atlanta Center for Cosmetic Dentistry in 1994.\n\n1996 Lorin Berland DDS, began providing a massage therapist on staff.\n\n1999 On July 11, 1999, the New York Times reported several Long Island dentists were offering \"distraction techniques\" by offering massage therapy to their patients. The article reports that massage services were offered since early 1999.\n\n2001 On October 1, 2002, \"Salt Lake Magazine\" reported that the Dental Spa in Sugarhouse provided patients with complimentary spa services such as temple massage, hand treatments, eye masks, and other techniques aimed at calming the patients. The spa services were provided since the Spa's inception in 2001.\n\n2002 On August 12, 2002, the \"Los Angeles Times\" reported Lynn Watanabe, DDS, one of the field's \"pioneers,\" opened \"Dental Spa\" in Pacific Palisades, California, with a full-time esthetician and full-time massage therapist.\n\nThe \"Wall Street Journal\" noted Jeff Golub-Evans of New York and Grace Sun of Los Angeles,\n\nIn 2003, the American Dental Association reported that more than 50% of 427 practicing dentists surveyed at their annual session offered some sort of spa or office amenity. In 2005, as many as 5% of the American Dental Association's more than 152,000 members had declared themselves \"dental spas\". In 2007, the ADA estimated that possibly that one in every 20 dental offices in the United States actually offers, to some extent, some spa dentistry services to their patients.\n\nIn 1978, the Holistic Dental Association was formed to focus on the mind-body connection and the dental patient's well being. Spa dentistry is recognized by the International Medical Spa Association and the Day Spa Association, but similar to the field of cosmetic dentistry, is not recognized as a specialty practice area by the American Dental Association. In 2002, Lynn Watanabe, DDS founded the first dental spa association with the creation of the International Dental Spa Association. \"The New York Times\" reported in 2006 that \"it now has ten members and are coming up with guidelines for what services constitute a dental spa.\"\n\nOne of the main reasons people avoid visiting the dentist is dental anxiety. Dental anxiety drives some people to create more dental problems by not visiting the dentist on a regular basis. Patients who are high in dental anxiety have the greatest likelihood of avoiding dental treatment. An estimated nine percent to fifteen percent of the American population—about 30 million to 40 million people—avoid essential dental care because of fear or anxiety.\n\nThe first known scientific study on dental fear occurred in 1954. Dental anxiety has been a well-studied phenomenon since the late 1960s. Since then, studies and several books report successful treatment of patients with dental fear using behavioral methods.\n\nAlthough there are many variations, adapters of the dental spa concept generally offer cosmetic, general, and restorative dentistry with a key focus on making the visit a pampering and pleasant experience.\n\n"}

The existence group is concerned with providing the basic material existence requirements of humans. They include the items that Maslow considered to be physiological and safety needs. The second group of needs is those of relatedness – the desire people have for maintaining important interpersonal relationships. These social and status desires require interaction with others if they are to be satisfied, and they align with Maslow's social need and the external component of Maslow's esteem classification. Finally, Alderfer isolates growth needs: an intrinsic desire for personal development. These include the intrinsic component from Maslow's esteem category and the characteristics included under self-actualization.\nAlderfer categorized the lower order needs (Physiological and Safety) into the Existence category. He fit Maslow's interpersonal love and esteem needs into the Relatedness category. The Growth category contained the self-actualization and self-esteem needs. Alderfer also proposed a regression theory to go along with the ERG theory. He said that when needs in a higher category are not met then individuals redouble the efforts invested in a lower category need. For example if self-actualization or self-esteem is not met then individuals will invest more effort in the relatedness category in the hopes of achieving the higher need.\n\nThis theory was published originally in \"Organizational Behavior and Human Performance\".\n\n\n"}

The college is not affiliated with the church. The classroom facilities, reportedly, are well equipped. But the building – particularly the entrance – has a , , utilitarian appearance. As was the case with North General Hospital, the decision to remain in the neighborhood represents a civic commitment to Harlem.\n\nA school of nursing was founded October 15, 1945, by New York City's Hospital for Joint Diseases, offering a one-year curriculum leading to becoming a Licensed Practical Nurse. Its inaugural class graduated October 29, 1946. By 1950, the program was named \"Hospital for Joint Diseases School of Practical Nursing\".\n\nThe school, in 1955, received a grant from the Helene Fuld Health Foundation and was subsequently named the \"Helene Fuld School of Practical Nursing\".\n\nIn 1964, under the leadership of Justine Hannan, RN, Director of Nursing Services and Nursing Education, the school launched the first program in the country to offer licensed practical nurses an accredited curriculum in higher education leading to a degree as a Registered nurse. In 1973, Mary Ahl-Heugel \"(née\" Mary Ellen Ahl; born 1918), PhD, RN, became Director of Nursing Education. In 1976, the school received a permanent charter from New York State with the authority to confer the Associate degrees in Applied Science with a nursing concentration, becoming one of the first hospital-based schools in New York State to offer the associate degree. \n\nIn 1978, the school phased out its practical nurse program. The last class of about 300 in practical nursing graduated in October 1978.\n\nIn 1979 the Hospital for Joint Diseases relocated downtown on East 17th Street and a new, private, non-profit corporation named \"Joint Diseases North General Hospital\" became the new tenant at 1919 Madison Avenue location in East Harlem. Helene Fuld College of Nursing had been, since October 15, 1945, a New York State Registered Nursing School.\n\nIn 1980, Margaret Wines, PhD, RN, became Dean. In 1981, the school's associate degree program became the first such hospital program to be accredited by the National League for Nursing. On October 27, 1987, the hospital was renamed North General Hospital. In 1988, the school became the first hospital-based nursing school to become accredited by the Middle States Commission on Higher Education.\n\nOn December 12, 1991, North General Hospital moved into a newly built, modern facility at 1879 Madison Avenue, between 120th and 121st Streets, two blocks south of its old location. In 1992, the Helene Fuld School of Nursing moved into its current location at 24 East 120th Street, New York.\n\nIn February 1996, with the permission of the Board of Regents of the University of the State of New York, the name \"Helene Fuld School of Nursing\" was changed to \"Helene Fuld College of Nursing\", reflecting the depth and breadth its curricular programs in higher education.\n\nIn July 2007, the College separated from North General hospital and amended its charter with the New York State Board of Regents as an independent not-for-profit college. North General Hospital – its former parent institution – closed July 2, 2010, and filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy. In 2012, Wendy Robinson, PhD, RN, became President of the College and the New York State Education Department authorized the College to confer Bachelor of Science degrees for registered nurses.\n\nThe college uses blue, green, purple, and black in its publications. Moreover, the interior design color palette of the college's main reception area uses those colors. With the exception of black, nurses commonly wear scrubs in those colors. Since 2010, there has been a growing trend for hospitals and health care organizations to assign scrub color codes to help identify healthcare professional by discipline or department. Color coded uniforms, however, have been widely criticized by healthcare workers for various reasons, one being that it cultivates a caste mentality in an environment that requires teamwork across all disciplines. In any event, the colors at the college do not represent a particular discipline or academic level.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe immediate neighborhood, until about 1992, had been blighted. This was the case with many neighborhoods and districts throughout the five boroughs. In 1992, when North General Hospital moved into its new quarters two blocks south, Maple Plaza, an eight-story, 155-unit residential co-op, designated for affordable housing, was built in its place at 1919 Madison Avenue. Maple Plaza was developed in the 1990s under a plan by the city and North General Hospital to revive the area around the hospital. Eugene Louis McCabe (1937–1998), President and CEO of North General Hospital from its inception in 1979 until his death in 1998, was a strong advocate of developing Maple Plaza. Maple Court, another similar project in the area with 135 units, was completed before Maple Plaza. Since then, the area around Marcus Garvey Park has developed. The neighborhood is no longer blighted. While gentrification is typically criticized by civic leaders for making neighborhoods unaffordable – particularly to those who, for generations have thrived and lived there – the neighborhood surrounding Marcus Garvey Park, by design, offers a mix of affordable housing. At the same time, adjusting to gentrification throughout Harlem is an ongoing concern of policy makers, citizens, civic leaders, and religious leaders.\n\nTwo blocks west of the college, in the Mount Morris Park Historic District, there has been considerable recent (since 2000) residential development and restoration. The stretch of 122nd Street between Mount Morris Park West and Malcolm X Boulevard \"(aka\" Sixth Avenue and Lenox Avenue) is known as \"Doctors' Row\". As has been the case in many neighborhoods throughout the five boroughs, old, historic residential buildings, including brownstones, fell into disrepair. Until around 1999, on Mount Morris Park West, between 120 and 121st Streets, there was a row of brownstones, built around 1885, which, according to the \"New York Times,\" were so deteriorated that they came known as \"The \"Ruins\". That row has been completely rebuilt into luxury condominiums that were initially priced for mixed income buyers. Revitalization since the 1990s has occurred in many neighborhoods, including the Mount Morris Park Historic District, notably brownstones, and in particular the brownstones at 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, and 16 West 122nd Street, on the south side of the street, which date back to 1888 and 1889. Those particular brownstones were designed by William Tuthill. St. Martin's Episcopal Church, featuring a tower that houses the city's second largest carillon (40 bells), is at 18 West 122nd Street – at the corner of Malcolm X Boulevard. It is a New York City Designated Landmark.\n\n\"Fifth on the Park,\" Harlem's first Upper East Side-style high-rise condominium tower is one block east from the college, at the southeast corner of 120th Street and Fifth Avenue – at 1485 Fifth Avenue. Its architects are FxFowle. The tower, 28 stories, 26 of which are residential, includes a 38,000 square foot (3,500 m) church with a four-story, 1,800-seat sanctuary for the Bethel Gospel Assembly, who sold the development rights for a full block. There are 194 residences, of which 47 are church-owned affordable rental apartments, and 147 are market-rate condominiums. The spa includes a 55-foot (16.76 m) lap pool.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "24764596", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=24764596", "title": "Historical trauma", "text": "Historical trauma\n\nHistorical trauma (HT), a term used by social workers, historians, and psychologists, refers to the cumulative emotional and psychological wounding of an individual or generation caused by a traumatic experience or event. Historical trauma response (HTR) refers to the manifestation of emotions and actions that stem from this perceived trauma.\n\nHTR is exhibited in a variety of ways, most prominently through substance abuse which is used as a vehicle for attempting to numb the pain associated with trauma. HTR often includes other types of self-destructive behavior, such as suicidal thoughts and gestures, depression, anxiety, low self-esteem, anger, violence and difficulty recognizing and expressing emotions. Many historians and scholars believe the manifestations of violence and abuse in certain communities are directly associated with the unresolved grief that accompanies continued trauma.\n\nHistorical trauma, and its manifestations, are an example of transgenerational trauma. For example, a pattern of maternal abandonment of a child might be seen across three generations, or the actions of an abusive parent might be seen in continued abuse across generations. These manifestations can also stem from the trauma of events, such as the witnessing of war, genocide, or death. For these populations that have witnessed these mass level traumas (e.g., war, genocide, colonialism), several generations later these populations tend to have higher rates of disease.\n\nFirst used by social worker and mental health expert Maria Yellow Horse Brave Heart in the 1980s, scholarship surrounding historical trauma has expanded to fields outside of the Lakota communities Yellow Horse Brave Heart studied. Yellow Horse Brave Heart's scholarship focused on the ways in which the psychological and emotional traumas of colonization, relocation, assimilation, and American Indian boarding schools have manifested within generations of the Lakota population. Yellow Horse Brave Heart's article \"Wakiksuyapi: Carrying the Historical Trauma of the Lakota,\" published in 2000, compares the effects and manifestations of historical trauma on Holocaust survivors and Native American peoples. Her scholarship concluded that the manifestations of trauma, although produced by different events and actions, are exhibited in similar ways within each afflicted community.\n\nOther significant original research on the mechanisms and transmission of intergenerational trauma has been done by scholars such as Daniel Schechter, whose work builds on the pioneers in this field such as: Judith Kestenberg, Dori Laub, Selma Fraiberg, Alicia Lieberman, Susan Coates, Charles Zeanah, Karlen Lyons-Ruth, Yael Danieli, Rachel Yehuda and others. Although each scholar focuses on a different population – such as Native Americans, African Americans, or Holocaust Survivors – all have concluded that the mechanism and transmission of intergenerational trauma is abundant within communities that experience traumatic events. Daniel Schechter's work has included the study of experimental interventions that may lead to changes in trauma-associated mental representation and may help in the stopping of intergenerational cycles of violence.\n\nJoy DeGruy's book, \"Post Traumatic Slave Syndrome\", analyzes the manifestation of historical trauma in African-American populations, and its correlation to the lingering effects of slavery. In 2018, Dodging Bullets, the first documentary film to chronicle historical trauma in Indian Country, was released. It included interviews with scientist Rachel Yehuda, sociologist Melissa Walls, and Anton Treuer along with first hand testimonies of Dakota, Lakota, Ojibwe and Blackfeet tribal members.\n\nHistorical Trauma (HT), or Historical Trauma Response (HTR), can manifest itself in a variety of psychological ways. However, it is most commonly seen through high rates of substance abuse, alcoholism, depression, anxiety, suicide, domestic violence, and abuse within afflicted communities. The effects and manifestations of trauma are extremely important in understanding the present-day conditions of afflicted populations.\n\nWithin Native American communities, high rates of alcoholism and suicide have direct correlation to the violence, mistreatment, and abuses experienced at boarding schools, and the loss of cultural heritage and identity these institutions facilitated. Although many present-day children never experienced these schools first-hand, the \"injuries inflicted at Indian boarding schools are continuous and ongoing,\" affecting generations of Native peoples and communities.\n\nColonial oppressors like Australia and Canada have issued formal apologies for their involvement in the creation and implementation of boarding schools that facilitated and perpetuated historical trauma. Australia's Bringing Them Home report and Canada's Truth and Reconciliation Commission (Canada) both detailed the \"experiences, impacts, and consequences\" of government-sponsored boarding schools on Indigenous communities and children. Both reports also detail the problems facing Indigenous populations today, such as economic and health disparities, and their connection to the historical trauma of colonization, removal, and forced assimilation.\n\nTreatment of HT must repair the afflicted person or communities' connection with their culture, values, beliefs, and self-image. It takes the forms of individual counseling or therapy, spiritual help, and group or entire community gatherings, which are all important aspects in the foundations of the healing process. Treatment should be aimed at a renewal of destroyed culture, spiritual beliefs, customs, and family connections, and a focus on reaffirming one's self-image and place within a community. Without proper treatment and understanding, historical trauma will continue to plague generations of afflicted communities.\n\nParticular attention should be given to the needs and empowerment of peoples who are vulnerable, oppressed, and living in poverty. Social workers and activists should promote social justice and social change with and on behalf of clients, individuals, families, groups, and communities. In order for advocacy to be accurate and helpful to the afflicted populations, social workers should understand the cultural diversity, history, culture, and contemporary realities of clients.\n\n\nCases:\n\n"}

Since 1994 it has become a biennial event. Until 1953 each congress was organised by radiological society of the host country, but in that year, a formal organisation, the International Society for Radiology was set up to provide continuity between the congresses.\n\nAt the second congress, held in 1928 in Stockholm, three international commissions were set up - the International Commission on Radiological Protection (ICRP), the International Commission on Radiation Units and Measurements (ICRU) and the International Commission on Radiological Education (ICRE). The latter two have become fully functional organisations in their own right while the latter has remained a sub-committee of the ICR.\n\nWithin years of Röntgen discovering X-Rays in 1895, they were being used for imaging fractured bones. Various societies sprung up in different countries where ideas were exchanged between like-minded people and national standards for the measurement of X-Ray intensity developed. These societies also tried to address the problems associated with the dangers of X-Rays, particularly cancer.\nBy the end of the First World War a number of proposals on how to measure the intensity of X-Rays had been made, but there was little agreement between the various parties concerned. In 1925 the British Institute of Radiology, under the leadership of Charles Thurstan Holland invited delegates from a number of countries to attend the First International Congress on Radiation in London. This congress set up a framework for future meetings - future congresses would meet every three years in a different country, would be organised by the host country. The host country would nominate the chairman of the congress. It was also established that three commissions should be set up which would meet at the congresses:\nUntil the outbreak of the Second World War, congresses were held every three years. The 1940 congress was due to meet in Berlin in 1940, but was suspended due to the war. Apart from some copies of records kept by the 1973 Congress secretary-general, Benjamin Orndoff, the records of the congress, which had been handed to the German organisers in preparation for the next congress in Germany, were lost during the Second World War.\n\nThe second congress was held in Stockholm under the chairmanship of Manne Siegbahn where the three commissions proposed in London met for the first time. Subsequent meetings were held in Paris (1931), Zurich (1934) and Chicago (1937).\n\nAfter the war, the British Institute of Radiology organised the sixth Congress which was held in London, exactly 25 years after the first congress and in the same hall as the first congress. A total of 3364 people from 54 countries including 1,742 radiologists registered for the congress. The incumbent chairman of the ICR, Arthur C. Christie, who had been nominated thirteen years before was unable to attend the London conference, so Orndoff, the secretary-general of that congress deputised handing the presidency to Ralston Paterson. The congress also saw a resumption of the work of the three international commissions.\n\nAt the seventh congress, held in Copenhagen in 1953, the organisational details of the conference were overhauled and an executive committee under the chairmanship of Lauriston S. Taylor was set up to oversee the organisation of future congresses and to provide continuity between congresses.\n\nBefore the Second World War, the location of the congresses was dictated largely by the places of residence of the delegates who had to travel by rail or sea - a delegate from the western seaboard of the United States would have to commit a month to attend a week-long ICR congress in Europe. The advent of air travel removed this restriction and subsequent congresses have since been held in many parts of the world. The following congresses have been held to date (or are scheduled):\n\n\nThe International Society of Radiology was set up in 1953 to oversee the organisation of the International Congresses of Radiology and to provide continuity between congresses.\n\nThe 1950 congress provided an occasion for workers in the radiology industry to meet for the first time in over a decade and to discuss the direction future congresses should take. At the 1953 congress, under the guidance of Flemming Norgaard in Copenhagen the International Society of Radiology was set up to oversee the organisation of the International Congresses of Radiology rather than the ad hoc arrangement whereby the organisation of the next congress was left entirely in the hands of the host country. A permanent committee would also provide continuity between congresses. Norgard became the first secretary-general of the Society, while the radiologist from the sponsoring society who had been president of a congress was, by that token, president of the ISR until the next meeting.\n\n\n"}

After serving abroad in this capacity for seven years, he was appointed surgeon to \"'HMS\" Scout on the west coast of Africa.\n\nMcWilliam returned to England in November 1839, and attended the London medical schools and hospitals. He became M.D. of Edinburgh in 1840, and in September of the same year was appointed senior surgeon on board the steamer \"Albert\", which joined the expedition sent to the River Niger for geographical and commercial purposes, and against the continuing Atlantic slave trade. The \"Albert\" and two other vessels left England on 12 May 1841, and entered the Niger on 18 August. On 4 September a malignant fever broke out in the Albert, and almost simultaneously in the other two vessels. The latter were sent back to sea filled with the sick and dying, leaving the \"Albert\" to continue the voyage alone.\n\nBy 4 October the \"Albert\" had also turned back, and was managed for some days by McWilliam and William Stanger, the other officers and crew being unable to take part in the work. In ten days they reached the open sea. A few days later McWilliam himself was taken ill. Out of 145 Europeans who took part in the expedition 130 went down with fever and 40 died; but among 158 Africans there were only 11 cases of fever and 1 death. McWilliam reached England on 19 November 1841.\n\nAfter again serving two years afloat, McWilliam was sent on a special mission to the Cape de Verde Islands to inquire into the yellow fever which attacked the inhabitants of Boa Vista soon after the arrival of the \"HMS\" Eclair. In 1847 he was appointed medical officer to the custom house, a post he retained till his death.\n\nIn 1848 McWilliam was elected Fellow of the Royal Society, in 1858 he became Companion of the Order of the Bath, and in 1859 Fellow of the Royal College of Physicians of London.

Donald Martin and his mother was the daughter of Norman Macdonald and sister of Lieut-Gn. Sir John Macdonald. Martin was educated at St. George's and Windmill Street School. He became a C.C.S. in 1811 and entered the Bengal Medical Service on 5 September 1817. He obtained commission of assistant-surgeon through the interest of his uncle, Sir John MacDonald.\n\nHe reached India at the port of Calcutta in June 1817 by ship, the \"Lord Hungerford\", and reported for duty with the Bengal service on 2 December 1817.\n\nIn 1818 he served in his Majesty's 17th and 59th Regiments forming the garrison of Fort William. Here he came to see the effect of Cholera. He was then sent to Orissa where a malignant fever had prevailed and destroyed more than half the inhabitants of Ganjam. He saw action in a number of military engagements during the 1820s. The most notable of these was the First Burmese War from 1823–26. His war experiences, especially the fact that diseases affected the natives and the Europeans differently, led him to believe that mapping of the medical features of the empire in much the same way as topography was critical for military and economic development. His notes on the medical topography of Calcutta pioneered a genre of works that explored linkages between climate, public health and development. He was made the President of the East India Company's medical board in 1843. In 1856, he substantially re-wrote and extended the then well-known treatise on diseases in the tropics, \"Influence of Tropical Climates\" originally authored by James Johnson. He was also appointed as a member of the Sanitary Commission and contributed to the report of the Commission published in 1863.\n\nSmallpox vaccinations had been started in India around 1803, well before his arrival but Martin was the first major advocate of preventive medicine. He proposed in 1835 that Company medical officers should collect statistics of places so that they could be collated for study. His pioneering report on the need for public health measures and the universal provision of clean water in Calcutta in 1836 called for a whole series of medico-topographical reports on India by the medical service. During the Burma War, a number of his colleagues in the Medical Department of the Bengal Army wrote topographies of Rakhine State, and in the following years other Company surgeons began to follow suit, producing detailed medical surveys of their town or district. The Medical and Physical Society of Calcutta, of which Martin was a prominent member, and its counterparts in other presidencies, encouraged the publication of such reports in their transactions. Many of these reports spoke about the rapid rates of deforestation since the early 1820s. Such reports were instrumental in institutionalization of forest conservation activities in British India through the establishment of Forest Departments and the Indian Forest Service.\n\n\n"}

In its original form, it imposed duties on individual households regarding order and cleanliness inside the common property within the building, like staircases or entrances, as well as outside the house, especially on public pathways and places adjacent to the house. It was a weekly duty, taken in turns, on Saturday.\n\nStuttgart's municipal law from 1492 states, \"To ensure that the city stays clean, everyone should remove their muck, (...) from your own street corner every 14 days, although only at night. Those who do not have a privy, must bring the waste to the stream.\" In the 18th century, a new law, the \"clean alley ordnung\" came about, that added detail. In 1988 the kehrwoche was abolished as a communal law. It doesn't apply to public order in any part of Baden-Wurtemberg, but it can be part of house rules and rental contracts. The communal order obliges every owner of a house to hold parts of his property, like entrance areas and access paths as well as the public pavements free of dirt, snow and ice. There is no determined time or interval, making it a permanent obligation, contrary to the weekly duty on Saturdays as in the tradition of the kehrwoche.\n\nIn Württemberg, as generally in Germany and other countries, it is typical to include the kehrwoche into the rental agreement, describing which parties on which days clean the sidewalk, shovel snow and clean the staircases. Also a sign displaying the bolded letters \"Kehrwoche\" is often hung on the door of the party responsible for the Kehrwoche activities of the week. The rental owner as well as the other tenants can see who is responsible for such tasks.\n\nAgreements distinguish between \"small\" and \"large\" kehrwoche. Small kehrwoche includes hallways and staircases. Large kehrwoche includes the outdoor sidewalk in front of the house. Outside of Württemberg the cleaning of multi-tenant property is organized very similarly, using \"large and small house rule\" with identical meaning, as long as the delegation of cleaning responsibilities is not given to costly outside vendors or building superintendent.\n\nThe Kehrwoche is often cited as something highly characteristic of Swabians or of Wurttemberg, often seen as proving their petifogging obsession with order. In actual fact it proves to be more of a myth, or a projection of a German characteristic on one particular of its ethnic subgroups.\n\n\n"}

The study estimated that the global rate was 7.6 intentional homicides per 100,000 inhabitants for 2004.

{"id": "21115942", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=21115942", "title": "Multidrug tolerance", "text": "Multidrug tolerance\n\nMultidrug tolerance or antibiotic tolerance is the ability of a disease-causing microorganism to resist being killed by antibiotics or other antimicrobials. It is mechanistically distinct from multidrug resistance: It is not caused by mutant microbes, but rather by microbial cells that exist in a transient, dormant, non-dividing state. Microorganisms that display multidrug tolerance can be bacteria, fungi or parasites.\n\nRecognition of antibiotic tolerance dates back to 1944 when Joseph Bigger, an Irish physician working in England, was experimenting with the recently discovered penicillin. Bigger used penicillin to lyse a suspension of bacteria and then inoculated culture medium with the penicillin-treated liquid. Colonies of bacteria were able to grow after antibiotic killing. The important observation that Bigger made was that this new population could be again be killed by penicillin except for a small residual population. Hence the residual organisms were not antibiotic resistant mutants but rather a subpopulation of what he called ‘persisters’. The formation of persisters is now known to be a common phenomenon that can occur by the formation of persister cells prior to the antibiotic treatment or in response to a variety of antibiotics.\n\nMultidrug tolerance is caused by a small subpopulation of microbial cells termed persisters. Persisters are not mutants, but rather are dormant cells that can survive the antimicrobial treatments that kill the majority of their genetically identical siblings. Persister cells have entered a non- or extremely slow-growing physiological state which makes them insensitive (refractory or tolerant) to the action of antimicrobial drugs. When such persisting microbial cells cannot be eliminated by the immune system, they become a reservoir from which recurrence of infection will develop. Such non-growing bacteria have been observed to persist within mammalian cells. Indeed, it appears that persister cells are the main cause for relapsing and chronic infections. Chronic infections can affect people of any age, health, or immune status.\n\nBacterial multidrug or antibiotic tolerance poses medically important challenges. It is largely responsible for the inability to eradicate bacterial infections with antibiotic treatment. Persister cells are highly enriched in biofilms, and it has been suggested that this is the reason that makes biofilm-related diseases so hard to treat. Examples are chronic infections of implanted medical devices such as catheters and artificial joints, urinary tract infections, middle ear infections and fatal lung disease .\n\nUnlike resistance, multidrug tolerance is a transient, non-heritable phenotype. Multidrug tolerant persister cells are not antibiotic resistant mutants. Resistance is caused by newly acquired genetic traits (by mutation or horizontal gene transfer) that are heritable and confer the ability to grow at elevated concentrations of antimicrobial drugs. In contrast, tolerant bacteria have the same MIC (Minimum Inhibitory Concentration) as susceptible bacteria and differ in the duration of the treatment that they can survive. Multidrug tolerance can be caused by a reversible physiological state in a small subpopulation of genetically identical cells, similar to a differentiated cell type. It enables this small subpopulation of microbes to survive the antibiotic killing of their surrounding siblings. Persisting cells resume growth when the antimicrobial agent is removed, and their progeny is sensitive to antimicrobial agents.\n\nThe molecular mechanisms that underlie persister cell formation and multidrug tolerance are largely unknown. Persister cells are thought to arise spontaneously in a growing microbial population by a stochastic genetic switch, although inducible mechanisms of persister cell formation have been described. Owing to their transient nature and relatively low abundance, it is hard to isolate persister cells in sufficient numbers for experimental characterization, and only a few relevant genes have been identified to date. The best-understood persistence factor is the \"E. coli\" high persistence gene, commonly abbreviated as \"hipA\".\n\nAlthough tolerance is widely considered a passive state, there is evidence indicating it can be an energy-dependent process. Persister cells in \"E. coli\" can transport intracellular accumulations antibiotic using an energy requiring efflux pump called TolC.\n\nA persister subpopulation has also been demonstrated in budding yeast \"Saccharomyces cerevisiae\". Yeast persisters are triggered in a small subset of unperturbed exponentially growing cells by spontaneously occurring DNA damage, which leads to the activation of a general stress response and protection against a range of harsh drug and stress environments. As a result of the DNA damage, yeast persisters are also enriched for random genetic mutations that occurred prior to the stress, and are unrelated to the stress survival \n\nIn May 2011, it was reported by Nature.com that the addition of certain metabolites can help suppress multidrug tolerance in numerous species of bacteria, including \"E. coli\" and \"S. aureus\", by \"the generation of a proton-motive force which facilitates aminoglycoside uptake\". Phage therapy, where applicable, entirely circumvents antibiotic resistance.\n\n"}

It established and provided funds for a National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH). \n\nThe act made the mental health of the people a federal priority. It was inspired by alarm at the poor mental health of some draftees and veterans, and was demanded by veterans and their families. When veterans who were under stress during the war were later studied they displayed a high incidence of earlier mental health illness, completely aside from the problems that might have arisen from combat and wartime situations of high pressure.\n\nThrough the National Mental Health Act and the NIMH, a new form of diagnosis and treatment was created to better help those facing mental health problems. It was discovered during this time that mental health patients benefited more from evaluation and treatment rather than being institutionalized. The act redirected financing from the state level to a national level, and placed the NIMH as a leader for further research and analysis on the brain and psychiatric disorders.\n\nIn other words, wartime pressures had stirred up repressed mental illness in the soldiers, who were a representative statistical sample of the general population, gender aside. The government realized it had a very serious problem on its hands—a population with a high incidence of mental health illness and therefore should take care of it immediately via government intervention, aiming to cut off future social pathologies.\n\nThe Menninger brothers set about training analysts, to fill the vacuum that existed at that time.\n\nThe act was first introduced by Congress in March, 1945, as the National Neuropsychiatric Institute Act. The name ultimately made its way to \"Mental Health\" to capture the importance of World War II and the problems associated with veterans returning from war.\n\nRobert Felix, a psychiatrist appointed as director of the Public Health Service's (PHS) Division of Mental Hygiene in 1944, did much work to try to pass the bill. William Menninger, Lawrence Kubie, and others helped Felix by testifying about how the lack of trained professionals in the field of mental health sometimes thwarted military morale and how intervening earlier rather than later actually helped the military in the long run by conserving personnel. They believed that if veterans received federal help and support through preventive services, professional training, and research they would transition back into postwar life quicker and easier. In addition, organizations like Mental Health America that advocated for changes in the psychiatric field helped push legislation towards action.\n\nBefore the act was passed, during World War II, there was a severe shortage of professionals in the mental health field, and advanced treatment and understanding of psychiatric disorders lagged behind the increasing numbers of problems in veterans returning from the war. This provided the foundation for the act and the reasoning behind it.\n\nAfter the act was passed, many discoveries and breakthroughs regarding mental health diagnosis and treatment were made. These new drugs and treatments improved the lives of those previously suffering from psychosis and delusion, and were a result of the new funding and federal support that came from the National Mental Health Act of 1946.\n\n"}

{"id": "674776", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=674776", "title": "Pelvic floor", "text": "Pelvic floor\n\nThe pelvic floor or pelvic diaphragm is composed of muscle fibers of the levator ani, the coccygeus muscle, and associated connective tissue which span the area underneath the pelvis. The pelvic diaphragm is a muscular partition formed by the levatores ani and coccygei, with which may be included the parietal pelvic fascia on their upper and lower aspects. The pelvic floor separates the pelvic cavity above from the perineal region (including perineum) below.\n\nThe right and left levator ani lie almost horizontally in the floor of the pelvis, separated by a narrow gap that transmits the urethra, vagina, and anal canal. The levator ani is usually considered in three parts: pubococcygeus, puborectalis, and iliococcygeus. The pubococcygeus, the main part of the levator, runs backward from the body of the pubis toward the coccyx and may be damaged during birth. Some fibers are inserted into the prostate, urethra, and vagina. The right and left puborectalis unite behind the anorectal junction to form a muscular sling. Some regard them as a part of the external anal sphincter. The iliococcygeus, the most posterior part of the levator ani, is often poorly developed.\n\nThe coccygeus, situated behind the levator ani and frequently tendinous as much as muscular, extends from the ischial spine to the lateral margin of the sacrum and coccyx.\n\nThe pelvic cavity of the true pelvis has the pelvic floor as its inferior border (and the pelvic brim as its superior border). The perineum has the pelvic floor as its superior border.\n\nSome sources do not consider \"pelvic floor\" and \"pelvic diaphragm\" to be identical, with the \"diaphragm\" consisting of only the levator ani and coccygeus, while the \"floor\" also includes the perineal membrane and deep perineal pouch. However, other sources include the fascia as part of the diaphragm. In practice, the two terms are often used interchangeably.\n\nPosteriorly, the pelvic floor extends into the anal triangle.\n\nThe pelvic floor has two hiatuses (gaps): Anteriorly urogenital hiatus through which urethra and vagina pass through and posteriorly rectal hiatus through which anal canal passes.\n\nIt is important in providing support for pelvic viscera (organs), e.g. the bladder, intestines, the uterus (in females), and in maintenance of continence as part of the urinary and anal sphincters. It facilitates birth by resisting the descent of the presenting part, causing the fetus to rotate forwards to navigate through the pelvic girdle. It helps maintain optimal intra-abdominal pressure.\n\nThe pelvic floor is subject to clinically relevant changes that can result in:\n\nPelvic floor dysfunction can result after treatment for gynegological cancers.\n\nDamage to the pelvic floor not only contributes to urinary incontinence but can lead to pelvic organ prolapse. Pelvic organ prolapse occurs in women when pelvic organs (e.g. the vagina, bladder, rectum, or uterus) protrude into or outside of the vagina. The causes of pelvic organ prolapse are not unlike those that also contribute to urinary incontinence. These include inappropriate (asymmetrical, excessive, insufficient) muscle tone and asymmetries caused by trauma to the pelvis. Age, pregnancy, family history, and hormonal status all contribute to the development of pelvic organ prolapse. The vagina is suspended by attachments to the perineum, pelvic side wall and sacrum via attachments that include collagen, elastin, and smooth muscle. Surgery can be performed to repair pelvic floor muscles. The pelvic floor muscles can be strengthened with Kegel exercises.\n\nDisorders of the posterior pelvic floor include rectal prolapse, rectocele, perineal hernia, and a number of functional disorders including anismus. Constipation due to any of these disorders is called \"functional constipation\" and is identifiable by clinical diagnostic criteria.\n\nPelvic floor exercise (PFE), also known as Kegel exercises, may improve the tone and function of the pelvic floor muscles, which is of particular benefit for women (and less commonly men) who experience stress urinary incontinence. However, compliance with PFE programs often is poor, PFE generally is ineffective for urinary incontinence unless performed with biofeedback and trained supervision, and in severe cases it may have no benefit. Pelvic floor muscle tone may be estimated using a perineometer, which measures the pressure within the vagina. Medication may also be used to improve continence. In severe cases, surgery may be used to repair or even to reconstruct the pelvic floor.\n\nPerineology or pelviperineology is a speciality dealing with the functional troubles of the three axes (urological, gynaecological and coloproctological) of the pelvic floor.\n\n\n"}

The society is not recognized by the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) because it does not meet all the conditions set out in the Statues of the Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement, and it is not a member of the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies. From its founding in 1904, to 1949, when the Kuomintang retreated to Taiwan, the society shared its history with the Red Cross Society of China. Both societies associate their origins with the founder, Shen Dunhe, a tea merchant.\n\nOn 3 March 1904, during the Russo-Japanese War, Shen Dunhe created the \"Manchuria Red Cross Benevolent Society\" and on 10 March 1904, the society was renamed the \"Shanghai International Red Cross Committee\". Its founders were Chinese business and political leaders and expatriates from the West. Shen chose the aegis of the Red Cross because its neutrality allowed aid to reach those Chinese civilians caught between Japanese and Russian forces in Manchuria.\n\nAfter the Russo-Japanese War, the society expanded and its mission to aid those affected by war and disaster continued. The society opened Red Cross hospitals in Shanghai and other cities. Local Red Cross chapters were popular because the association represented international connections, modernity and its activities were seen as patriotic. For example, the society sent workers to San Francisco after the 1906 earthquake and workers, medicines and funds were sent to Japan after the 1923 Great Kantō earthquake. In 1920, there were over 300 Red Cross chapters in China.\n\nIn 1912, the ICRC recognised the national society of the then Republic of China. In 1919, the society joined the International Federation as one of its first members. In the 1920s, 30s and 40s, the society held ties with American and British Red Cross, the Kuomintang government and the Shanghai business community. In 1933, during the Second Sino-Japanese War, the Act of Administrative Rules and Procedures of the Red Cross Society of the Republic of China () was passed. The society was renamed the \"Red Cross Society of the Republic of China\".\nThe society's activities during the war time period (1937 - 1945) were limited to Kuomintang held areas in southwest China and to some areas under Japanese control. Supplies were received through Burma and India from the United States and the United Kingdom. Expatriate Chinese also raised funds.\n\nAfter 1950, when the major hostilities of the Chinese civil war had ended, the society moved its headquarters to Taiwan. In 1955, the government of the Republic of China declared the Red Cross Society of the Republic of China the sole national humanitarian organization of the country and wrote this in legislation. The act clarified the role of the society in the case of invasion by the forces of the Communist Party of China and in caring for wounded Taiwanese soldiers and prisoners of war. Fiscal exemptions for society volunteers were approved. The organization was tasked with provision of basic sanitation and hygiene to the most impoverished; and, with teaching first aid to adults and children.\n\nThe society meets most of the conditions laid out in Article 4 of the Statutes of the International Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement of 1995, except that Taiwan is not a signatory to the Geneva Conventions. Its mission may be made more difficult because of a lack of clarity surrounding the society's independence from the Red Cross Society of China.\n\nOn 11–12 September 1990, the society held talks with its mainland counterpart in Kinmen, resulting in the Kinmen Agreement signed on 12 September. The talks were about issues such as repatriation of criminals, smugglers or fugitives in the spirit of humanity and practicality.\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "3642748", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=3642748", "title": "Truth (anti-tobacco campaign)", "text": "Truth (anti-tobacco campaign)\n\nTruth (stylized as truth) is a national campaign aimed at eliminating teen smoking in the United States. \"truth\" produces television and digital content to encourage teens to reject tobacco and to unite against the tobacco industry. When \"truth\" launched its campaign in 1998, the teen smoking rate was 23%. In 2017, that number was down to 2.1% of middle schoolers and 7.6% of high schoolers, partly due to the \"truth\" campaign. In August 2014, \"truth\" launched \"Finish It\", a redesigned campaign encouraging youth to be the generation that ends smoking.\n\nThe \"truth\" campaign was modeled after a campaign developed by the Florida Tobacco Pilot Program, which ran from 1998 to 2003.\n\nThrough their marketing campaign, the program set out to drive a wedge between the tobacco industry's advertising and a youth audience. The program not only assembled a team of advertising and public relations firms, but also collaborated with Floridian youth to develop a campaign that would effectively speak to their generation. Youth articulated their frustrations with the manipulative marketing tactics used by the tobacco industry, and described their ideal campaign as one that would give them facts and the truth about tobacco. From this emerged the concept of uniting youth in a movement against tobacco companies promoted through grassroots advocacy and a youth-driven advertising campaign.\n\nIn March 1998, student delegates at a meeting sponsored by Florida's Office of Tobacco Control voted to change the theme of the campaign to \"truth, a generation united against tobacco.\" In April 1998, Florida launched a $25 million advertising campaign that included 33 television commercials, seven billboards, eight print ads and four posters. With a target audience of youth aged 12–17, the Florida \"truth\" campaign modeled their approach after commercial marketing to teens, and used messages that \"attacked the [tobacco] industry and portrayed its executives as predatory, profit hungry, and manipulative.\" The ads re-framed tobacco as an addictive drug promoted by the adult-establishment, and tobacco control as a hip, rebellious, youth-led movement. The grassroots effort of the campaign involved real teenagers taking on the tobacco industry as part of the 13-day \"Truth Train\" tour across the state. Despite positive results, reduced funding for the program, among other factors, ultimately led to the demise of Florida’s \"truth\" campaign.\n\nAs Florida’s campaign diminished, Truth Initiative (originally the American Legacy Foundation), adopted Florida's successful strategy and converted \"truth\" into a national campaign. Generally consistent with Florida's campaign, Truth Initiative's version of \"truth\" featured hard-hitting messages highlighting the deceptive practices of tobacco companies, and stark facts about the deadly effects of tobacco.\n\n\"truth\" strives to be a brand youth can identify with. In stark contrast to the heavy \"life or death\" tone adopted by many anti-tobacco campaigns, the strategy behind \"truth\" is to emphasize the facts about tobacco products and industry marketing practices, without preaching or talking down to its target audience. The resonating theme underlying \"truth\" is one of tobacco industry manipulation. With hard-hitting advertisements featuring youths confronting the tobacco industry, \"truth\" built a brand focused on empowering youth to construct positive, tobacco-free identities. Above all, the campaign avoids making directive statements telling youth not to smoke, and instead encourages them to make up their own minds about smoking and the tobacco industry. \"truth\" channels youths’ rebellious nature and need to assert their independence towards tobacco control efforts.\n\nIn addition to exposing industry marketing practices, many of the advertisements produced for \"truth\" focus on facts about the ingredients in cigarettes and the consequences of smoking, including addiction, disease, and death. A large portion of the facts and information exposed in \"truth\" advertisements were pulled from real tobacco industry documents that were made publicly accessible following the Master Settlement Agreement. The Truth Tobacco Documents Library, created in 2002 and managed by the University of California San Francisco, houses millions of formerly secret tobacco industry internal corporate documents.\n\nThe \"truth campaign's initial objective was to \"change social norms and reduce youth smoking.\" In building a strategy to accomplish this goal, \"truth\" campaign designers looked to marketing and social science research, evidence from other successful campaigns, and engaged in conversations with teen audiences. This research revealed that although youth were aware of the deadly nature of cigarettes, they were attracted to smoking as a tool for rebellion and empowerment. The \"truth\" campaign designers wanted to counter the appeal of cigarettes by encouraging teens to rebel against the duplicity and manipulation exhibited by tobacco companies.\n\nSince the launch of \"truth\" in 2000, the campaign asserts it has \"utilized many different forms of media and evolved its tactics to ensure it reached the teen audience most effectively.\"\n\nArguably the most recognized media produced for \"truth\" are its television advertisements. For example, the iconic \"truth\" advertisement \"1200\" portrays a mass of youth walking up to a major tobacco company building, then suddenly collapsing as if dead while a single youth remains standing with a sign that reads, \"Tobacco kills 1,200 people a day. Ever think about taking a day off?\" In the \"Body Bags\" commercial, youths pile body bags on the sidewalk outside of a tobacco company's headquarters. One youth steps forward with a megaphone to shout up at the workers in the building, \"do you know how many people tobacco kills every day? This is what 1200 people actually looks like.\" Another \"truth\" advertisement, \"Singing Cowboy\", portrays a cowboy who has a breathing stoma (opening) in his neck singing, \"you don’t always die from tobacco, sometimes you just lose a lung\", and other similar lyrics. A third commercial, \"1 out of 3\", uses \"fantasized scenes such as an exploding soda can\" to convey the message that tobacco is the only product that prematurely kills one out of three users. Perhaps one of truth's best-known campaigns, \"Shards O' Glass,\" aired during Super Bowl XXXVII. The commercial showed an executive for a popsicle company, \"Shards O' Glass,\" that provided disclaimers for their product - a popsicle with shards of glass in it, clearly unsafe and deadly - and posed the question, \"What if all companies advertised like big tobacco?\"\n\nThrough social media feedback and focus group testing, \"truth\" designers learned teens respond best to \"up-front and powerful messages that display courage and honesty in a forceful way.\" With that in mind, other edgy \"truth\" advertisements with various themes were produced between 2000 and 2014, including \"Connect truth\", \"The Sunny Side of truth\", \"Unsweetened truth\", and \"Ugly truth.\"\n\nPrior to the launch of the Food and Drug Administration’s \"Real Cost\" campaign in February 2014, \"truth\" was the only national youth tobacco prevention campaign not sponsored by the tobacco industry.\n\nIn August 2014, \"truth\" launched the \"Finish It\" campaign targeting the next generation of U.S. youth aged 15 to 21. Along with a revamped campaign design, web presence, and series of ads, Finish It embraces a powerful new campaign theme: be the generation that ends smoking for good. In research with its target audience, campaign designers discovered today’s teenagers are less interested in protesting against tobacco industry manipulation, and more interested in driving positive collective action. \"Finish IT\" was developed to suit this generation’s desire to be agents of social change. The campaign aims to empower the 94 percent of teenage nonsmokers, and the 6 percent of teen smokers, to take an active role in ending the tobacco epidemic.\n\nThe first campaign ad released, \"Finishers\", was shot in the style of a video manifesto and tells youth, \"We have the power. We have the creativity. We will be the generation that ends smoking. Finish it.\" The spot encouraged youth to get involved in the \"Finish IT\" movement by superimposing the campaign logo, an \"X\" in an orange square, onto their Facebook profile picture. This online activism tactic is similar to that used by the Human Rights Campaign when they asked individuals to change their profile pictures in support of marriage equality.\n\nIn another series of \"Finish IT\" ads, \"Unpaid Tobacco Spokesperson\" and \"Unpaid Tobacco Spokesperson Response\", the campaign tries to shed light on the way smokers, especially celebrity smokers, give tobacco companies free marketing as \"unpaid spokespeople\" when their photos are posted. As a response, Finish It asked youth to \"think before you post a smoking selfie.\" The campaign also encouraged youth to \"erase and replace\" cigarettes from photos on social media with various props from the \"truth\" website.\n\nIn 2015, \"Left Swipe Dat,\" a full-length song and music video created as part of the \"Finish IT\" campaign, debuted at the 57th Annual Grammy Awards and connected smoking to dating. The video featured Becky G, Fifth Harmony, King Bach and other influencers. The lyrics revealed that you get half the matches on dating apps if you're smoking in your profile picture. \"Left Swipe Dat\" encouraged teens to lose the cigarettes so they could avoid being \"left swiped,\" aka, passed over on a dating app.\n\nIn another effort to connect smoking to a teen passion point, \"CATmageddon\" showed teens that smoking is bad for pets and set up the scenario that if there were no cats (due to smoking-related illness and disease) there would be no cat videos and therefore there would be a \"CATmageddon,\" a \"world devoid of furry kittens and the adorable, hilarious videos that come with them.\" The ad launched at the 58th Annual Grammy Awards and featured partnerships with Petco, Adult Swim, and BuzzFeed.\n\nIn 2017, the \"truth\" campaign showed how the tobacco industry has targeted African-Americans, low-income communities, LGBTQ individuals, members of the military as well as those with mental health conditions. The campaign encouraged young people to take note of the industry's advertising tactics while educating teens on the tobacco-related health disparities across these demographics. Initial documentary style videos created for this campaign featured comedian and actress Amanda Seales and premiered at the 59th Annual Grammy Awards. Later videos, premiered at the 2017 MTV Video Music Awards and featured journalists Kaj Larsen and Ryan Duffy, as well as rapper Logic.\n\nIn 2018, \"truth\" launched anti-vaping campaign ads showing the dangers of vaping for the first time.\n\nIn addition to its television advertisements, \"truth\" maintains an online presence and employs guerrilla \"on-the-street\" marketing. Grassroots marketing is done via a team of \"truth tour riders\" who are sent to popular music and sporting events across the country every summer, including Warped Tour, Mayhem Festival and High School Nation.\n\n\"truth\" also produces a line of custom merchandise every summer that is distributed at events. Each piece of merchandise features a design that corresponds with a fact about smoking. Items are often created in partnership with artists, such as a pair of custom sneakers made in collaboration with Kevin Lyons and Vans shoes. That partnership also spawned a contest called \"Custom Culture\" where students competed in design challenges relevant to the campaign's merchandise and subject matter.\n\nRigorous evaluation studies of \"truth\" have been published in the peer-reviewed literature since the launch of the campaign in 2000. To evaluate the effectiveness of \"truth\", Truth Initiative employs an internal Research and Evaluation team. Its efforts include evaluation of televised truth ads as well as digital, gaming and grassroots campaign components. Between 1999 and 2004, Truth Initiative (known at the time as the American Legacy Foundation) conducted a nationally-representative Media Tracking Survey of youth aged 12–17 to inform its \"truth\" campaign evaluation. The Legacy Media Tracking Survey (LMTS) measured tobacco-related attitudes, beliefs, and behaviors, exposure to smoking influences including \"truth\", sensation seeking, and openness to smoking.\n\nCross-sectional studies on the effectiveness of the \"truth\" campaign provided convincing evidence that the campaign \"had a significant impact on tobacco industry-related attitudes, beliefs, and other behavioral precursors, as well as a significant impact on youth smoking prevalence in the United States.\" Exposure to \"truth\" was also associated with a statistically significant reduction in nonsmokers’ intentions to smoke in the future. Another study of \"truth\" from 2000 to 2004 examined whether campaign awareness and receptivity differed for youth across socioeconomic backgrounds. In 2005, a study published in the American Journal of Public Health conducted by RTI International, Columbia University, and Truth Initiative used a pre/post quasi-experimental design to relate changes in national youth smoking prevalence to exposure to the \"truth\" campaign over time. The study’s statistical analyses showed that smoking rates among youth in the U.S. declined at a faster rate after the launch of the \"truth\" campaign. A similar study published in the American Journal of Preventive Medicine in 2009 found a direct association between youth exposure to \"truth\" messaging and a decreased risk of taking up smoking.\n\nA 2009 study examined whether the $324 million investment in the \"truth\" campaign could be justified by its effect on public health outcomes. Researchers found that the campaign was economically efficient because it saved between $1.9 and $5.4 billion in medical care costs to society between 2000-2002. In this way, the authors argue \"truth\" is a cost-effective public health intervention.\n\nA study evaluating the \"Finish IT\" campaign indicated lower intentions to smoke in the next year as well as anti-tobacco attitudes with higher ad awareness. Ad recall remained high, even when the campaign aired lower levels of television targeted rating points as compared with earlier \"truth\" advertising campaigns.\n\nThe \"truth\" campaign has been praised by a number of leading federal and state public health officials, as well as the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services. The campaign has also been recognized for its achievements in marketing with numerous awards in advertising efficacy, such as Emmy, Clio Healthcare, and Effie awards. \"truth\" has also been featured in a variety of academic marketing and communications textbooks to educate the next generation of public health and social marketing leaders.\n\nIn 2014, Advertising Age named truth one of the top 10 ad campaigns on the 21st century.\n\nIn 2016, the Monitoring the Future study, which surveys national samples of over 45,000 youth in grades 8, 10 and 12, reported historically low levels of current cigarette use amongst youth - only 6 percent of teens still smoke.\n\nA \"truth\" campaign radio ad called \"Dog Walker\" prompted Lorillard Tobacco Company to pursue litigation against Truth Initiative (then the American Legacy Foundation). The dispute ran from July 2001 until its resolution in July 2006. In the ad, an actor who identified himself as a dog walker placed a phone call to Lorillard, offering to sell Lorillard the urine from his dogs. The \"truth\" advertisement states urine and tobacco both contain urea.\n\nInitially, Lorillard accused the ad agency of violating the laws regarding the taping of telephone conversations and threatened to refer them to the criminal authorities. In October 2001, Lorillard filed a Motion for a Declaratory Ruling with the Federal Communications Commission (FCC), asking the FCC to rule that the radio stations’ broadcast of the ad violated an FCC regulation regarding broadcasting of telephone conversations. In November 2001, Lorillard notified Truth Initiative of their intent to litigate against the organization and its ad agency for defamation. Lorillard stated that it would not sue if the foundation agreed to a series of demands. Accordingly, Truth Initiative entered into discussions with Lorillard to attempt an out-of-court resolution. However, on January 18, 2002, Lorillard abandoned discussions and advanced a new claim that portions of the \"truth\" campaign violated the Master Settlement Agreement's prohibition against \"vilification\" or \"personal attacks.\"\n\nCases were filed in both Delaware and North Carolina. The matter was resolved by the Delaware Supreme Court on July 17, 2006. They ruled unanimously that the \"truth\" campaign did not violate the Master Settlement Agreement.\n\n\n"}

This idea was first portrayed in the 1981 film \"Looker\", wherein models had their bodies scanned digitally to create 3D computer generated images of the models, and then animating said images for use in TV commercials. Two 1992 books used this concept: \"Fools\" by Pat Cadigan, and \"Et Tu, Babe\" by Mark Leyner.\n\nIn general, virtual humans employed in movies are known as synthespians, virtual actors, vactors, cyberstars, or \"silicentric\" actors. There are several legal ramifications for the digital cloning of human actors, relating to copyright and personality rights. People who have already been digitally cloned as simulations include Bill Clinton, Marilyn Monroe, Fred Astaire, Ed Sullivan, Elvis Presley, Bruce Lee, Audrey Hepburn, Anna Marie Goddard, and George Burns. Ironically, data sets of Arnold Schwarzenegger for the creation of a virtual Arnold (head, at least) have already been made.\n\nThe name \"Schwarzeneggerization\" comes from the 1992 book \"Et Tu, Babe\" by Mark Leyner. In one scene, on pages 50–51, a character asks the shop assistant at a video store to have Arnold Schwarzenegger digitally substituted for existing actors into various works, including (amongst others) \"Rain Man\" (to replace both Tom Cruise and Dustin Hoffman), \"My Fair Lady\" (to replace Rex Harrison), \"Amadeus\" (to replace F. Murray Abraham), \"The Diary of Anne Frank\" (as Anne Frank), \"Gandhi\" (to replace Ben Kingsley), and \"It's a Wonderful Life\" (to replace James Stewart). Schwarzeneggerization is the name that Leyner gives to this process. Only 10 years later, Schwarzeneggerization was close to being reality.\n\nBy 2002, Schwarzenegger, Jim Carrey, Kate Mulgrew, Michelle Pfeiffer, Denzel Washington, Gillian Anderson, and David Duchovny had all had their heads laser scanned to create digital computer models thereof.\n\nEarly computer-generated animated faces include the 1985 film \"Tony de Peltrie\" and the music video for Mick Jagger's song \"Hard Woman\" (from \"She's the Boss\"). The first actual human beings to be digitally duplicated were Marilyn Monroe and Humphrey Bogart in a March 1987 film \"Rendez-vous in Montreal\" created by Nadia Magnenat Thalmann and Daniel Thalmann for the 100th anniversary of the Engineering Institute of Canada. The film was created by six people over a year, and had Monroe and Bogart meeting in a café in Montreal, Quebec, Canada. The characters were rendered in three dimensions, and were capable of speaking, showing emotion, and shaking hands.\n\nIn 1987, the Kleiser-Walczak Construction Company (now Synthespian Studios), founded by Jeff Kleiser and Diana Walczak coined the term \"synthespian\" and began its Synthespian (\"synthetic thespian\") Project, with the aim of creating \"life-like figures based on the digital animation of clay models\".\n\nIn 1988, \"Tin Toy\" was the first entirely computer-generated movie to win an Academy Award (Best Animated Short Film). In the same year, Mike the Talking Head, an animated head whose facial expression and head posture were controlled in real time by a puppeteer using a custom-built controller, was developed by Silicon Graphics, and performed live at SIGGRAPH. In 1989, \"The Abyss\", directed by James Cameron included a computer-generated face placed onto a watery pseudopod.\n\nIn 1991, \"\", also directed by Cameron, confident in the abilities of computer-generated effects from his experience with \"The Abyss\", included a mixture of synthetic actors with live animation, including computer models of Robert Patrick's face. \"The Abyss\" contained just one scene with photo-realistic computer graphics. \"Terminator 2: Judgment Day\" contained over forty shots throughout the film.\n\nIn 1997, Industrial Light and Magic worked on creating a virtual actor that was a composite of the bodily parts of several real actors.\n\nBy the 21st century, virtual actors had become a reality. The face of Brandon Lee, who had died partway through the shooting of \"The Crow\" in 1994, had been digitally superimposed over the top of a body-double in order to complete those parts of the movie that had yet to be filmed. By 2001, three-dimensional computer-generated realistic humans had been used in \"\", and by 2004, a synthetic Laurence Olivier co-starred in \"Sky Captain and the World of Tomorrow\".\n\nThe \"Star Wars\" Anthology film, \"Rogue One: a Star Wars story\" (2016) whose plot ends minutes before that of \"\" (1977), digitally recreated the appearances of Peter Cushing in the role Grand Moff Tarkin (played and voiced by Guy Henry), and Carrie Fisher as Princess Leia (played by Ingvild Deila. Fisher's only line was added using archival voice footage of Carrie Fisher saying the word \"Hope\".). The virtual versions replicated the characters' appearances as seen in the aforementioned \"Star Wars Episode IV: A New Hope\". Cushing had died in 1994, while Fisher died a few days after the film's release. Industrial Light and Magic created the special effects, and noted that the technique would not be used often, noting also that the \"young Han Solo film\" would not use Harrison Ford's likeness.\n\nCritics such as Stuart Klawans in the \"New York Times\" expressed worry about the loss of \"the very thing that art was supposedly preserving: our point of contact with the irreplaceable, finite person\". And even more problematic are the issues of copyright and personality rights. Actors have little legal control over a digital clone of themselves. In the United States, for instance, they must resort to database protection laws in order to exercise what control they have (The proposed Database and Collections of Information Misappropriation Act would strengthen such laws). An actor does not own the copyright on his digital clones, unless they were created by him. Robert Patrick, for example, would not have any legal control over the liquid metal digital clone of himself that was created for \"Terminator 2: Judgment Day\".\n\nThe use of digital clones in movie industry, to replicate the acting performances of a cloned person, represents a controversial aspect of these implications, as it may cause real actors to land in fewer roles, and put them in disadvantage at contract negotiations, since a clone could always be used by the producers at potentially lower costs. It is also a career difficulty, since a clone could be used in roles that a real actor would never accept for various reasons. Bad identifications of an actor's image with a certain type of roles could harm his career, and real actors, conscious of this, pick and choose what roles they play (Bela Lugosi and Margaret Hamilton became typecast with their roles as Count Dracula and the Wicked Witch of the West, whereas Anthony Hopkins and Dustin Hoffman have played a diverse range of parts). A digital clone could be used to play the parts of (for examples) an axe murderer or a prostitute, which would affect the actor's public image, and in turn affect what future casting opportunities were given to that actor. Both Tom Waits and Bette Midler have won actions for damages against people who employed their images in advertisements that they had refused to take part in themselves.\n\nIn the USA, the use of a digital clone in advertisements is required to be accurate and truthful (section 43(a) of the Lanham Act and which makes deliberate confusion unlawful). The use of a celebrity's image would be an implied endorsement. The United States District Court for the Southern District of New York held that an advertisement employing a Woody Allen impersonator would violate the Act unless it contained a disclaimer stating that Allen did not endorse the product.\n\nOther concerns include posthumous use of digital clones. Barbara Creed states that \"Arnold's famous threat, 'I'll be back', may take on a new meaning\". Even before Brandon Lee was digitally reanimated, the California Senate drew up the Astaire Bill, in response to lobbying from Fred Astaire's widow and the Screen Actors Guild, who were seeking to restrict the use of digital clones of Astaire. Movie studios opposed the legislation, and as of 2002 it had yet to be finalized and enacted. Several companies, including Virtual Celebrity Productions, have purchased the rights to create and use digital clones of various dead celebrities, such as Marlene Dietrich and Vincent Price.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "35772281", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=35772281", "title": "Wandering womb", "text": "Wandering womb\n\nWandering womb was the belief that a displaced uterus was the cause of many medical pathologies in women. The belief originates in the medical texts of ancient Greece, although it persisted in European academic medicine and popular thought for centuries.\n\nThe belief in the \"wandering womb\" was found in ancient Greece. Some scholars have argued that it originated in Egypt, but this has now been disproved. One description of the theory of a \"wandering womb\" comes from Aretaeus, a physician from Cappadocia, who was a contemporary of Galen in the 2nd century AD. He wrote that the uterus could move out of place, and float within the body. In the translation of Francis Adams (1856) this reads: \n\nThe Greek translated here as \"like an animal within an animal\" would be better translated as \"like a living thing inside another living thing\". The belief that the uterus could move freely, which this imagery evokes, was linked to the use of scent therapy to entice it up or down within the body. This may have been part of ancient cultural beliefs in Greece, but the earliest known written accounts of it are in the fifth- and fourth-century BC texts associated with the name of Hippocrates. The movement of the uterus was believed to cause symptoms throughout the body, depending on the destination to which the uterus moved in search of fluid.\n\nSoranus of Ephesus, another second century AD physician, opposed the theory of the \"wandering womb\". In a description of what he labelled \"hysterical suffocation\" - suffocation arising in the uterus - Soranus wrote, \"the uterus does not issue forth like a wild animal from the lair, delighted by fragrant odors and fleeing bad odors, rather it is drawn together because of stricture caused by inflammation\". Where Aretaeus used the more neutral \"living thing\", Soranus used the term for \"wild beast\", \"therion\". Galen also insisted that the uterus was stationary and that symptoms were due to substances being retained inside it. This suggests that Aretaeus was unusual among physicians of his period in believing in a mobile and animate womb. Despite the fact that Soranus was an influential writer on gynecology, and that Galen was the Greco-Roman medical writer with the greatest overall influence on Medieval and Renaissance medicine in Europe, the belief in the \"wandering womb\" continued for centuries, for example in Edward Jorden's influential 1603 treatise on the supposed bewitching of 14 year-old Mary Glover.\n\nThe idea of a condition called hysteria caused by \"wandering womb\" developed from the \"hysterical suffocation\" of ancient Greek writers. Medical researchers developed a better understanding of anatomy after the invention of microscopes in the 17th century and cellular research in the 19th century. Sigmund Freud's theory of the free-floating unconscious, the \"mind within the mind\", was similar to the ancient belief in the \"animal within the animal\". Both \"wandering womb\" and \"hysteria\" are unused in medical theories of today.\n\n"}
{"id": "31530072", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=31530072", "title": "Water supply and sanitation in Namibia", "text": "Water supply and sanitation in Namibia\n\nNamibia is an arid country that is regularly afflicted by droughts. Large rivers flow only along its Northern and Southern border, but they are far from the population centers. They are also far from the country's mines, which are large water users. In order to confront this challenge the country has built dams to capture the flow from ephemeral rivers, constructed pipelines to transport water over large distances, pioneered potable water reuse in its capital Windhoek located in the central part of Namibia, and built Sub-Saharan Africa's first large seawater desalination plant to supply a uranium mine and the city of Swakopmund with water. A large scheme to bring water from the Okavango River in the North to Windhoek, the Eastern National Water Carrier, was only partially completed during the 1980s.\n\nMost urban residents have access to drinking water supply, but access lags behind in rural areas. Access to sanitation also considerably lags behind access to drinking water supply. The bulk water supply infrastructure is owned by NamWater, a public entity operating under commercial principles. It sells water to the mining companies, as well as to the municipalities which in turn sell it to urban residents and businesses.\n\nNamibia’s climate is hot and dry with erratic rainfall during two rainy seasons in summer. Within Africa its climate is second in aridity only to the Sahara. Namibia shares several large rivers, such as the Orange River in the South, shared with South Africa, as well as the Zambezi and Okavango Rivers in the North, shared with Angola, Zambia and Botswana. But these rivers are far away from the population centers and the cost of tapping them for drinking water supply is prohibitive. Only the Cunene River, which is shared with Angola, provides drinking water for four Northern regions of Namibia. The total average \"safe yield\" of Namibia’s water resources is estimated at 660 million m/year, distributed as follows: groundwater 300 million m/year, ephemeral rivers 200 million m/year, perennial rivers 150 million m/year and unconventional sources such as treated wastewater 10 million m/year.\n\nGroundwater is distributed unevenly over the territory of Namibia, thus making the construction of pipelines necessary to tap their potential. In particular, the coastal area is nearly devoid of groundwater. Recharge in these areas is low and unreliable, groundwater lies at great depths and sometimes is of poor quality. Other areas are favorable, sitting on high-yielding, very productive aquifers that contain more water than farmers and communities presently need. Numerous small springs throughout the country sustain wildlife, man and livestock. Over the past century, more than 100 000 boreholes have been drilled in Namibia. Half of these are still in operation. In 2012 German hydro-geologists discovered a huge aquifer in Northern Namibia that could supply the area, where 40% of the population of the country lives, for 400 years. The aquifer, called Ohangwena II, contains about 5 billion cubic meters of water which is up to 10,000 years old. The aquifer is about 300 meters deep and is under pressure, so that its water could be pumped up at a relatively low cost. However, a saline aquifer sits on top of the freshwater aquifer, so that drilling must be done carefully in order to avoid saline intrusion. The aquifer receives some recharge from Angola in the North. Experts recommend that, during normal climatic conditions, water abstraction should be limited to the inflow from the North in order to manage the aquifer on a sustainable basis. However, during extended droughts induced by climate change, the aquifer can be drawn down and serve as an important buffer against drought.\n\nIn some areas, groundwater is slightly saline (brackish). In the Omusati Region in Northern Namibia, four small brackish water desalination plants were installed in 2010 as part of the German-Namibian research project CuveWaters. The plants are powered by solar energy and provide between 0.5 and 3.3 m of safe drinking water per day, enough to satisfy the basic needs of between 10 and 66 people. At 15 Euro/m the cost of desalinating brackish water in these small plants is very high.\n\nMany of the ephemeral (=seasonally flowing) rivers of the Namibian interior are dammed and, according to the FAO, provide a 95%-assured yield of 96 million m/year, based on historical rainfall data. These dams have low safe yields in comparison to their total volume, because of uneven flows over time and high evaporation losses. Thus only about half the water from ephemeral rivers is usable. There is surplus water in some dams, e.g. in the Oanob Dam, the Hardap Dam, the Naute Dam and the Friedenau Dam. This surplus water cannot be used because of the remote location of these dams and the comparatively limited local demand.\n\nNamibia suffers from regular droughts, the most recent one hitting the country in 2015/16.\n\nThe water from perennial (=permanently flowing) rivers used in Namibia corresponds to the small share of Namibia in its border rivers. The actual abstractions as of 1999 (latest available data) were 23 million m from the Cunene River at Ruacana, 49 million m from the Orange River at Noordoewer, 22 million m from the Okavango River (that flows through Namibia in the Caprivi Strip) at Rundu, and 7 million m from the Zambezi River. Namibia has agreements in place with Angola and South Africa about the sharing of the Cunene and Orange Rivers respectively. The water allocation from the Cunene River is 180 million m and thus far larger than the amount withdrawn.\n\nIn Northern Namibia rain is relatively abundant, but it falls only during the dry season, creating temporary natural ponds called Oshanas. At the height of the rainy season the water in these ponds is clear and of good quality. In a pilot project as part of the CuveWaters research program, in the remote village Lipopo in the Southern Oshana region water from an Oshana has been pumped to a storage tank to be used for the irrigation of vegetables during the dry season using a drip irrigation system. In addition, rainwater is being collected from the rooftop of a greenhouse and from the roofs covering the storage ponds. In another village, Epyeshona near Oshakati, only rainwater is collected, both on an individual basis from the rooftops of houses, and on a communal basis from a concrete area on the ground constructed especially for rainwater harvesting. In both cases the water is used for the irrigation of vegetables during the dry season, either in an open filed or in a communal greenhouse.\n\nThe first large desalination plant in Sub-Saharan Africa was inaugurated by Areva on the 16 April 2010. The Erongo plant is located near Wlotzkasbaken, 30 km north of Swakopmund. Its maximum capacity is 20 million m per year but it will initially supply 13 million m. Its primary purpose was to supply the uranium mine at Trekkopje, located inland. The Trekkopje mine however never opened due to persistent low uranium prices, hence the plant has a contract to sell water to state-owned service provider Namwater and provides some of the water requirements for the town of Swakopmund. During the 2016 drought Areva offered to sell its plant to the Namibian government for $200 million USD.\n\nReuse of treated wastewater is practiced in Namibia in many urban areas such as Swakopmund, Walvis Bay, Tsumeb, Otjiwarongo, Okahandja, Mariental, Oranjemund and Windhoek. In most localities, water is reused for irrigation. In Windhoek, reclaimed water is also used for potable uses.\n\nA representative example of direct potable reuse is the case of Windhoek (Namibia, New Goreangab Water Reclamation Plant (NGWRP)), where treated wastewater has been blended with drinking water for more than 45 years. It is based on the multiple treatment barriers concept (i.e. pre-ozonation, enhanced coagulation/dissolved air flotation/rapid sand filtration, and subsequent ozone, biological activated carbon/granular activated carbon, ultrafiltration (UF), chlorination) to reduce associated risks and improve the water quality. Since the year 1968 the capital of Namibia, Windhoek, has used reclaimed wastewater as one of their drinking water sources, which nowadays represent about 14% of the city’s drinking water production. In 2001, the New Goreangab Reclamation Plant (NGWRP) was built by the City of Windhoek and it started to deliver drinking water in 2002 (about 21,000 m of water per day).\n\nThere is also a pilot project for small-scale reuse of treated wastewater in rural areas in Outapi in Northern Namibia as part of the CuveWaters research project. The wastewater of 1,500 people is collected in vacuum sewers and treated in such a way that pathogens are removed, but nutrients remain to a large extent in the water. The technology is relatively sophisticated for a rural area in a developing country, using upflow anaerobic sludge blanket digestion followed by aerobic treatment using a rotating biological contactor, a microsieve and ultraviolet disinfection. The water is then used to irrigate vegetables for the local market. Community members have been trained in how to operate the facilities and a tariff and billing system has been introduced to recover the operating costs of the plant from users.\n\nTotal water use in Namibia was estimated at 300 million m in 2000. The municipal sector including tourism and industry used 73 million m (24 percent), while the bulk of water use is for agriculture and livestock. Only 13 million m (4 percent) was used in mining at the time, although this amount has increased due to the development of mining – in particular uranium mining – after 2000. Mining in Namibia makes extensive use of water, which is used for a broad range of activities including in particular mineral processing, but also dust control, slurry transport and the water use of employees. Uranium mining uses large quantities of water for processing using alkali heap leaching. For example, the Trekkopje mine in the Namib desert uses 14 million m/year of high-quality water that must be free of any salt. Saline water extracted through local wells is used for dust suppression, thus reducing the need for freshwater. Furthermore, some of the wastewater is treated and reused, thus further reducing water demand. Freshwater demand is met from the Erongo desalination plant that also supplies neighboring communities. Since the lifetime of the plant (30 years) is longer than the expected lifetime of the mine (12 years), already when the plant was planned it was expected that it would be taken over by NamWater at the closure of the mine.\n\nThe UN evaluated in 2011 that Namibia has improved its water access network significantly since independence in 1990. Furthermore, in rural areas access is sometimes limited by the long distance between residences and water points. As a result, many Namibians prefer the traditional wells over the available water points far away.\n\nWindhoek is provided with water from three different sources. As of 2006 17 Mio m of the water demand was covered by dams around Windhoek, such as the von Bach Dam, 5.4 Mio m from the Goreangab Reclamation Plant and only between 1 and 2 Mio m still come from boreholes. The city estimates per capita water consumption at 200 liter per capita per day including industries, businesses and tourism, which is slightly higher than in Europe. An analysis of residential water consumption alone estimated it at 163 liter per capita per day in 2010, with significant differences between neighborhoods. For example, it was 306 liter in high-income neighborhoods in the South-East, while it was only 27 liter in informal settlements in the North. During the severe drought of 2015/16, water users in central Namibia were required to cut usage by up to 30 percent. In April 2016, the city of Windhoek launched a Zero Tolerance to Water Wastage policy, under which it would disconnect or fine on anyone using potable supply to water gardens or wash cars. The Swakoppoort Dam, Von Bach Dam and Omatako Dam, which supply the region, were only filled at 11 percent of their capacity. In May, the Coca-Cola Namibia Bottling Company stopped production due to the severe water shortages.\n\nThe Ministry of Agriculture, Water and Forestry is in charge of water resources management, drinking water supply and sanitation in Namibia. Within the Ministry the Department for Water Resources Management and the Department for Rural Water and Sanitation Coordination are in charge of water supply and sanitation.\nNamWater is a state-owned bulk water supplier that operates dams, pipelines and water treatment plants throughout the country. Created in 1997, it provides and sells water to mines, as well as to municipalities which in turn distribute and sell the water to households, businesses and offices in their respective service areas. In rural areas, the Directorate of Rural Water Supply of the Ministry of Agriculture, Water and Forestry is in charge of water supply and sanitation.\n\nNamWater operates 16 dams, 14 water transmission lines (called \"water supply networks\") and 16 water treatment plants. The transmission lines are as follows:\n\nIn Windhoek, groundwater was almost the only source of water for until 1958 when a small surface reservoir, the Goreangab Dam, was built downstream from Windhoek. A conventional water treatment plant was also constructed to treat the surface water from this reservoir. In 1960 the Gammams Wastewater Treatment Plant was commissioned near Goreangab Dam, discharging treated wastewater downstream of the reservoir. Subsequently, industrial and domestic effluents at the wastewater treatment plant were separated. The plant treating the domestic wastewater was upgraded so that its effluent could be further treated in the existing water treatment plant.\n\nThe water treatment plant was also upgraded, so that it could further treat the treated wastewater in one train, alongside the existing train for the raw water from Goreangab Dam. Thus, the Goreangab Reclamation Plant was born in 1968. Its output was blended with water from the city's well field and was delivered as drinking water to the city's residents. When the city grew further, the municipality started to receive water from the Von Bach Dam 170 km north of Windhoek commissioned in 1970. The 1974 Water Master Plan envisaged The Eastern National Water Carrier to supply water to Namibia's central area from the Okavango River, some 750 kilometers to the north on the Angolan border. Construction of the carrier began in the late 1970s in several phases from South to North, first connecting the von Bach Dam to the newly built Omatako Dam further North over a distance of 94 km, and then connecting the Omataku Dam to Grootfontein over a distance of another 300 km. However, the next and last phase of the scheme connecting Grootfontein to the Okavango River near Rundu was never built. The Omatako Dam, completed in 1981, now only receives flood water and is empty most of the time.\n\nIn the 1990s, the city introduced progressive water pricing and educational programs that reduced consumption substantially. The daily per capita residential consumption decreased from 201 liters in 1990/91 to 117 liters in 1996/97, partly due to the introduction of a very high drought tariff. When the normal water tariff was put in place again in 1997/98, the consumption increased to 130 liters/person/day. Total per capita consumption including commerce and industry shows a reduction from 322 liters/capita/day in 1990/91 to 201 liters/capita/day in 1997/98. According to a study by the International Union for the Conservation of Nature (IUCN), water consumption was lowered in all sectors, which is a major achievement because the reduction in water consumption in public buildings is not easily achieved. In schools, government buildings and municipal gardens, army bases and prisons the water consumption was lowered by as much as 50%. These savings postponed new supply infrastructure by about 10 years. But despite all these savings more water was needed. Thus the plant's capacity was almost tripled in 2002, allowing it to provide more than a third of the city's water demand and to relieve overused groundwater resources.\n\nTo retain public confidence, water quality at the Goreangab Treatment Plant is monitored on an ongoing basis after every process step. In the event of any quality problems, the plant goes into recycle mode and water is not delivered. According to Pisani \"The citizens of Windhoek have over time become used to the idea that potable reuse is included in their water provision process. In fact, they have grown to harbor a fair amount of pride in the fact that their city in many respects leads the world in direct reclamation.\" The upgrading of the plant was partly funded by the European Investment Bank (EIB) and Germany through KfW development bank. In its ex-post evaluation of the project, KfW noted that the plant faced considerable technical difficulties and temporary shutdowns over a period of seven years until it started to work properly. KfW noted that in the spirit of integrated water resources management more should have been done to reduce the per capita water consumption in Windhoek and to protect the Goreangab Dam from pollution, for example by establishing a protection zone with restricted activities around the reservoir. It also noted that the plant did achieve its objective to relieve pressure on overexploited groundwater resources.\n\nNamibia spends about 3% of its Gross Domestic Product on the operation expenditures of it water utilities. This is by far the highest percentage of all Sub-Saharan countries. Per capita, Namibia spends about 80US$ annually on water supply and sanitation, other countries in the region spend between 1 and 10 US$. Providing access to utility water in Namibia costs 4,000 US$ per capita on average.\n\nA large share of these expenses is borne by NamWater. NamWater passes its costs fully on to its customers. Since its inception some customers failed to pay their water bills, resulting in poor financial performance. However, beginning in 2003 the company was turned around financially, including also by cutting costs. Today NamWater refinances itself to a large extent through notes issues in the Namibian stock market. As of 2015, interest paid on five-year notes issued in the same year was 9.05 percent and the company had a BBB rating from the rating agency Fitch.\n\nWater tariffs in Namibia are among the highest in Africa. The first block of the residential water tariff in Windhoek costs N$13.86 (USD 0.92) per cubic metre in 2016. The water tariff includes a fixed monthly charge of N$74.43 (5 USD) which is independent of consumption. The first consumption block includes a basic consumption of 200 liter per household and day, an amount that is high for small households but can be low for large households. Higher consumption is charged at a higher tariff that was N$20.93 per cubic metre (USD 1.40) in 2015. The municipality bills water together with electricity, solid waste collection and the property tax. Residents of informal settlements receive water through public standpipes equipped with prepaid water meters. Prepaid customers pay about USD 1.9 per kiloliter (cubic metre), or about USD 0.038 per 20‐liter container.\n\nWater tariffs in other municipalities vary. Those municipalities that receive bulk water from NamWater, which includes all large municipalities, have to recover the costs of bulk water supply plus the cost of water distribution to the customers through their own networks. A few smaller municipalities that have their own water sources are not subject to this constraint. For example, the municipality of Oranjemund provides water for free and thus has by far the highest water use in the country with an astonishing 2,667 liters/capita/day. Bulk water tariff charged by NamWater vary slightly across the country depending on the cost of supplying a specific location, but these differences are not fully passed on to municipalities. Thus NamWater effectively cross-subsidizes localities with high supply costs with surpluses from localities with lower supply costs.\n\nCompared to the efforts made to improve access to safe water, Namibia is lagging behind in the provision of adequate sanitation. This includes 298 schools that have no toilet facilities. Over 50% of child deaths are related to lack of water, sanitation, or hygiene; 23% are due to diarrhea alone. The UN has identified a \"sanitation crisis\" in the country.\n\nApart from residences for upper and middle class households, sanitation is insufficient in most residential areas. Private flush toilets are too expensive for virtually all residents in townships due to their water consumption and installation cost. As a result, access to improved sanitation has not increased much since independence: In Namibia's rural areas as of 2008 13% of the population had more than basic sanitation, up from 8% in 1990. Many of Namibia's inhabitants have to resort to \"flying toilets\", plastic bags to defecate which after use are flung into the bush. The use of open areas close to residential land to urinate and defecate is very common and has been identified as a major health hazard.\n\nA National Sanitation Strategy 2010-15 estimated that it would cost N$1.64 billion over five years to reach the strategy's goal through 186 individual initiatives. The strategy also noted that it was unlikely that the government would be able to afford these costs.\n\n\n"}
