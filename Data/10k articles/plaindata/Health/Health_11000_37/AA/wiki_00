Recognized by the Government of Kenya as a Non-governmental organization (NGO), in 2011 obtained the same accreditation at the Italian Ministry of Foreign Affairs. Established in 2001, the association has its head offices in Rome and has volunteer-based regional offices in Piedmont, Liguria, Lombardy, Friuli-Venezia Giulia, Veneto, Emilia-Romagna, Lazio, Sicily. The association’s African office is based in Nairobi.\n\nThe aim of World Friends is to contribute to the achievement of the principles established in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights in all parts of the world, giving priority to fundamental rights for health, housing and education. World Friends’ actions at present are focused on the African continent and their final goal is to improve health, social and educational conditions in the most disadvantaged populations. Every action taken responds to actual needs and to a specific request from the local communities, and is undertaken with their full collaboration.\n\nFor this reason, the World Friends’ operative centre has taken the decision to live and work in the city of Nairobi in Kenya so as to assimilate better into the social structure of the area and be able to act as spokesman for the local communities.\n\nWorld Friends began from an initiative of Gianfranco Morino, a medical doctor with more than 35 years’ experience in Africa. After having collaborated for a number of years on projects with the Italian Cooperation for Development, in 1991 he took on responsibility with the Programme for Health Prevention and Education in the nomadic area of Sololo, North Kenya, collaborating with the UN High Commissioner for Refugees. Following work with the European Union in Somalia, in 1994 he began to work in health prevention and education in the shanty towns of Korogocho and Mathare in Nairobi. In 2002 he then took over the direction of the Department of Surgery at Mbagathi Hospital, still in the Kenyan capital, being the only European to work in a state-run hospital.\n\nIn 2001, together with a group of friends and collaborators, all convinced of the need for an association to be created in Africa itself, Morino established \"World Friends - Amici del mondo\". The central idea was that of an organization that could properly integrate with the reality of the local population, not being thousands of miles away, and able to carry out projects deriving from the concrete needs of these populations. To respond to that need, World Friends has over the years prioritized the use of local personnel, relying minimally on the services of expatriate personnel.\n\nThe objective of all World Friends projects is to promote health, education and social development of the most disadvantaged populations in the south of the world. World Friends is active in Kenya, Tanzania and Ethiopia, meeting the needs of the local populations and with their full involvement. The ultimate goal remains to encourage self-sufficiency in the communities where the Association works, and it is for this reason that World Friends makes use above all of local personnel for its activities in Africa, contributing to their professional training.\n\nAn example of World Friends approach is the construction of the Ruaraka Uhai Neema Hospital, a multi-functioning health centre opened by World Friends in November 2008 Inauguration of R.U. Neema Hospital. Situated near to the shanty towns of Nairobi the hospital treats more than 10,000 patients per month, thanks to a staff composed of 99% local personnel. The Ruaraka Uhai Neema Hospital dedicated not only to the treatment of the poorest sector of the population but also to the training of local medical personnel. This action will go on further to consolidate the work carried out by World Friends at the Mbagathi Hospital and at the surgeries located in the Nairobi shanty towns. In addition to health assistance, World Friends workers carry out action in the field of health prevention and education, above all to combat the spread of the HIV virus.\nServices offered by the hospital: General clinic and Maternal-Infant Clinic with vaccination services, gynecology and pediatrics; Maternity Department with operating theatre; Diagnostics Centre offering laboratory tests, radiography and echography. Accident & Emergency, minor surgery and day hospital; HIV tests and treatments; Physiotherapy and Occupational Therapy; Pharmacy; Ambulance service; Centre for Professional Training; Pediatrics Department.\n\nSince its inception in 2001, the association has focused its plan of action on achieving the eight Millennium Development Goals, approved by the 193 member States of the United Nations for world development, to be achieved within 2015. Today, the new challenge are the Sustainable Development Goals to which all countries are called upon to contribute to bringing the world to a global, economic and social sustainability path without distinction Between South and North.\nOur new goal is therefore the 2030: World Friends will not only continue to work against poverty in the South of the planet, expanding its collaboration with other communities in Africa and Latin America, but will also bring programs and experience in the suburbs of the North of the World, where injustice, inequality and the lack of rights are increasingly accentuated.\n\nWorld Friends works mainly in the sub-saharian countries of Africa, such as Kenya, Tanzania and Ethiopia.\nThe projects of World Friends are mainly focused on populations in the shantytowns in the north - east area of Nairobi (Korogocho, Kariobangi, Babadogo, Mathare Valley - Eastleigh, Huruma, Kahawa, Soweto).around 700,000 people, half of whom are under 15 years of age.\n\nThe beneficiaries of World Friends’ projects come from backgrounds marked by poverty, violence, criminality, prostitution, the precariousness of housing and work, pollution, diseases. The health problems found by the health workers of World Friends are innumerable: gastroenteritis and severe respiratory diseases, especially in children; a permanent status of malnutrition and the presence of typhoid fever and malaria. Tuberculosis is in evident recrudescence; the number of children with physical handicaps is high. The diagnosis of ailments requiring surgery and the incidence of cancer – the latter showing a clear increase – is often delayed due to the intrinsic inefficiencies of the health systems in African countries. The lack of specialist services for diagnosis and treatment accessible to the poor worsens the outcomes of traumas and burns, very frequent among children, often causing permanent disabilities in a context where physical integrity is linked to the survival of the individual. The transmission of sexual diseases is very widespread, AIDS in particular being a very real scourge.\n\nRegarding trends for the rest of the city and for the country, access to reproductive health services in the Nairobi slums is minimal: only 15% of the health structures present provide basic obstetrical assistance and only 35% of the births are assisted by qualified personnel. Maternal mortality in the shanty towns (590 mothers per 100,000 births in 1998) is higher than in any other region in Kenya. The infant mortality rate under 5 years of age (1,565 deaths for every 1000 babies, equal to 15.6%) is higher than that of any other urban settlement in Kenya. Lastly, because the incidence off AIDS is decreasing at the National level, in the Nairobi slums adolescents and women are still strongly vulnerable, with 37% of women between 20 and 24 years of age resulting positive to the infection.\n\nWorld Friends works in collaboration with many other bodies in Italian and international cooperation: CONCORD Italia Platform, Italian Observatory for Global Action against AIDS, Global Health Center of the Tuscany Region, \nSince 2016 World Friends is a member of LINK 2007, one of the three main networks representing NGOs nationwide.\nWorld Friends is part of regional networks that unite profit and non-profit realities, public bodies, universities and experts, thanks to the activities of local offices and volunteers. These realities work to systemize and strengthen local activities of international cooperation, the development of territorial cooperation and awareness raising in Italy. The most active are the Tuscan Forum for International Activities, the Coordination of Piedmont NGOs, the Janua Forum, the Ligurian Network for the Promotion of International Activities.\nNairobi's headquarters and association projects are constantly a place to visit by delegations from various organizations and by volunteers, interns and practitioners. World Friends is a member of several networks including: Hennet - Health NGOs Network, a NGO consortium and Kenyan and international institutions operating in Kenya in the field of healthcare; Action for Children with Disabilities (ACD), Nairobi Child Protection Network (NCPT), Elimu Yetu, Kasarani Genver-Based Violence Forum.\n\nIn addition to the realities involved in the projects at local level in Italy and in Africa, World Friends’ main partners are the following:\n\n"}

{"id": "30807917", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=30807917", "title": "Avram Steuerman-Rodion", "text": "Avram Steuerman-Rodion\n\nAvram Steuerman-Rodion, born Adolf Steuerman or Steuermann and often referred to as just Rodion (November 30, 1872 – September 19, 1918), was a Romanian poet, anthologist, physician and socialist journalist. A member of Romania's Jewish community, he was a lifelong militant for Jewish emancipation and assimilation, noted for poems which attack the prevailing antisemitism of his day. For a while, he was active as a propagandist of \"Hovevei Zion\" ideas among local Jews.\n\nDuring the early stages World War I, Rodion was a columnist at \"Seara\" daily, with articles which criticized Romania's prospects of joining the Entente Powers. Steuerman is himself described as a Germanophile, but, upon Romania's entry into the war in 1916, earned distinction on the local front. He committed suicide upon demobilization, following episodes of clinical depression.\n\nMarried into the family of Jewish intellectuals Moses and Elias Schwartzfeld, Steuerman-Rodion was thus related to poet-philosopher Benjamin Fondane, who was his literary pupil. Steuerman himself is often described as an obscure contributor to Romanian literature, but survives in cultural memory for having given a poetic voice to the ideals of Jewish integration.\n\nA native of Iași city, the historical capital of Moldavia region, Steuerman was a graduate of the National High School. He published his first poem in \"Drapelul\", a Moldavian weekly, and debuted as a polemicist in the satirical journal \"Perdaful\". A passionate writer and, according to his friend Blumenfeld-Scrutator, \"the prototype of journalistic refinement\", he moved on to establish his own newspaper. Addressed to the Moldavian Jews, it was called \"Răsăritul\" (\"The East\"), and stood for Zionism. Steuerman also contributed to the Iași gazette \"Jurnalul\", an organ of a left-wing political movement spearheaded by George Panu. Known under the pen name \"As.\", he was a noted proponent of socialist literature and didacticism in art, following the theories of socialist thinker Constantin Dobrogeanu-Gherea.\n\nAs a result, Steuerman had his works published in the Moldavian socialist review, \"Contemporanul\". He fought to defend Dobrogeanu-Gherea against dissident socialists, in particular against a pseudonymous critic, \"I. Saint Pierre\". In November 1894, he and Anton Bacalbașa of \"Adevărul\" daily were each proposing ways to uncover Saint Pierre's real identity, and debating each other on the actual nature of Pierre's critique. By then, Steuerman's own articles were being taken up by \"Adevărul\". As a correspondent, he was using a regional pen name: \"De la Iași\", later \"A. de la Iași\".\n\nBy 1893, Steuerman had enlisted at the University of Iași Faculty of Medicine, but was still preoccupied with literary studies. The Jewish printing house of Lazăr Șaraga hosted Steuerman's selection of Romanian literature, \"Autori români\" (\"Romanian Authors\"). Published in or around 1893, it was divided into two volumes: the Anthology-proper and the Chrestomathy. Steuerman and Șaraga published a second edition in 1896. Between these, Steuerman and his editor worked on translations from the work of philosopher Vasile Conta, putting out the \"Theory of Universal Undulation\" in 1894, and the \"Basic Metaphysics\" in 1896. The same collaboration brought the posthumous edition of poems by the socialist Traian Demetrescu, published by Șaraga and prefaced by Steuerman, and tales by Carmen Sylva, the Queen-consort of Romania.\n\nIn Moldavia, Steuerman made his name writing for the moderate left-wing paper \"Evenimentul\". Additionally, he worked with the \"Evenimenul\" men Al. Stroja-Flișki and Ioan Dafin on the literary magazine \"Cărticica Săptămânei\". Writing years later, Dafin called Rodion \"one of [Romania's] most talented journalists\". According to Dafin, he wrote with \"amazing ease\", and was involved on all aspects of creative work.\n\nIn parallel, Steuerman was studying to become a Doctor of Medicine: beginning in autumn 1896, he furthered his medical studies in France. Normally, this departure would have brought a hiatus in his journalistic activity. Steuerman compensated by mailing daily contributions to \"Evenimentul\", and, as Dafin notes, \"his absence from Iași was not at all felt by his readers.\" Upon his return, he set up a medical practice in the city. His thesis, on the treatment of skin cancer, was eventually printed in 1898.\n\nHis writing career was consecrated by several volumes of lyrical poetry—\"Sărăcie\" (\"Poverty\"), \"Lirice\" (\"Lyricals\"), \"Spini\" (\"Thorns\")—, a volume of short stories—\"O toamnă la Paris\" (\"An Autumn in Paris\")—, a libretto for an opera about Moldavian Prince Petru Rareș, and several translations. The latter work includes versions of plays or poems by Tristan Bernard, Heinrich Heine, Victor Hugo, Ada Negri, Leo Tolstoy etc.\n\nIn 1897, Steuerman was a contributor to \"Noutatea\" (\"The Novelty\"), an independent daily published in Iași by the Jewish poet Berman Goldner-Giordano. This short-lived gazette had a relatively obscure history, and one of its contributors, the maverick socialist Garabet Ibrăileanu reportedly forgot to mention it in all his later accounts of the period. Its regular contributors were young supporters of left-wing ideologies: alongside Steuerman and Giordano, they include poet Mihail Codreanu and future jurist Eugen Heroveanu. With Codreanu, Steuerman (who usually disguised his name under the signatures \"Rodion\", \"Aster\", \"Leander\" and \"Tristis\") took charge of the literary column and the poetry section. They were sporadically joined by other writers, among them Laura Vampa, Alexandru Toma, I. A. Bassarabescu, George Ranetti etc.\n\nSteuerman focused on his work in the journalistic genre. In 1901, Goldner's edited a selection of his friend's contributions, as \"Ele\" (\"Them\"). Four years later, Dacia publishers issued Rodion's critical essay about the classical Jewish humorist Cilibi Moise. At that stage, the Jewish writer was encountering resistance from the antisemitic literary movement in Moldavia. One such incident occurred when, as \"A. Trestianu\", he published his poems in the magazine \"Arhiva, Organul Societății Științifice și Literare\". That collaboration ended abruptly, when Gheorghe Ghibănescu, the editor in chief, discovered that Trestianu was a Jew, and ordered his staff to destroy the physical evidence of Rodion's correspondence.\n\nIn 1903, Steuerman married Angela, daughter of Iași-based Jewish folklorist Moses Schwartzfeld, and was integrated into the Schwartzfeld family. Rodion also became a literary chronicler at \"Ordinea\" (\"The Order\"), published by the Conservative-Democratic Party, and held a similar position at Alexandru Bădărău's \"Opinia\" (\"The Opinion\"). The latter employed him as its main editor for several years on end: Steuerman wrote three simultaneous columns in \"Opinia\", and (Dafin argues) was \"the paper's true soul.\" He was perpetually interested in new social and cultural developments, and enthusiastic about the birth of cinema, writing in \"Opinia\" about the coming demise of demise, and probably authoring the advertorials about \"moving-picture soirées\" in Iași.\n\nDuring those years, Rodion began a cordial correspondence with Ion Luca Caragiale, the self-exiled Romanian playwright. Himself a noted proponent of Jewish emancipation and Jewish Romanian literature, Caragiale viewed Steuerman as one of his best Jewish friends, a group which also includes Dobrogeanu-Gherea, dramatist Ronetti Roman, journalists Barbu Brănișteanu and Emil Fagure, as well as Steuerman's own publisher Șaraga. Around 1907, Caragiale publicly stated his admiration for Steuerman and Ronetti Roman. His words of praise irritated nationalist historian Nicolae Iorga, who published the antisemitic review \"Neamul Românesc\": in one of his articles for that magazine, Iorga reported that Caragiale was a sellout to Jewish interests. Caragiale indirectly reacted to this accusation in 1908, when he satirized Iorga's scholarly ambitions with a mordant epigram that was first published in \"Convorbiri Literare\".\n\nMeanwhile, Rodion was becoming a Romanian expert on the poetry of Heinrich Heine. In 1910, he published a comparative study of Heine and Édouard Grenier; a year later, the volume \"Complicele lui Heine\" (\"Heine's Accomplice\"). His work established Rodion's reputation outside Moldavia: in Transylvania, critic Ilarie Chendi noted that, with Dumitru Karnabatt and some others, the \"fecund\" Steuerman was still maintaining alive the tradition of cultural journalism. Diversifying his contributions, he published in \"Opinia\" and \"Ordinea\" his introductions to the work of Oscar Wilde. Obtaining Caragiale's blessing, he regularly put out quatrains with humorous commentary of political affairs. Rodion also rallied with \"Viața Socială\", a left-wing paper put out in Bucharest by the republican agitator N. D. Cocea. At Iași, he and Goldner-Giordano were invited to write for a regional newspaper of record, \"Gazeta Moldovei\". In 1912, Steuerman's review of French-language studies of Romanian literature, from Theodor Cornel to Léo Claretie, saw print in the newspaper \"Românul\" of Arad. The same year, again signing \"A. Trestianu\", he returned to \"Arhiva\" with a translation from Carmen Sylva.\n\nDespite literary recognition, and probably because he was perceived as a foreigner, Steuerman was not invited to join the newly created Romanian Writers' Society (SSR). He ridiculed the SSR's xenophobia in a series of articles for \"Ordinea\" and \"Opinia\". His comments enlisted negative reactions in Chendi's \"Cumpăna\" magazine, where it was implied that Rodion risked awakening latent antisemitism, but were defended by his more liberal colleagues at \"Noua Revistă Română\". At around the same time, Rodion had become a sympathizer of Josef B. Brociner and his \"Society of Romanian Israelites\"—a local branch of \"Hovevei Zion\" and one of Romania's first Jewish political associations.\n\nSteuerman befriended the much younger Benjamin Fondane (born \"Benjamin Wechsler\" in 1898), to whom he was known as \"bădi\" (\"uncle\") Adolf or Adolphe. Their camaraderie and kinship (Fondane was Moses Schwartzfeld's nephew) doubled as literary training: around 1912, when Fondane was aged 13, Steuerman reviewed his debut verse and encouraged him to continue. Reportedly, Rodion also helped introduce his relative to the socialist circles of Iași.\n\nDuring the first stage of World War I, when the Kingdom of Romania maintained its neutrality, Rodion grew close to the political circles comprising Germanophiles, neutralist socialists or pacifists. Like his colleagues there, Rodion was not a keen supporter of making Romania part of the Entente camp; he looked with more sympathy toward the German Empire and the Central Powers. He was allied with Panait Zosin and Sebastian Moruzzi, two left-wing dissidents from the Conservative-Democratic Party. Rodion contributed to Zosin's press organ, \"Îndrumarea\", which advanced election reform and complete Jewish emancipation.\n\nIn June 1915, Avram Steuerman was assigned a regular column in \"Seara\", a Bucharest newspaper founded by Germanophile agitator Alexandru Bogdan-Pitești and purchased from him by a German cartel. The \"Seara\" pieces, which he signed as Rodion and collectively titled \"Scrisori din Iași\" (\"Letters from Iași\"), sought to depict the Moldavian state of affairs in lively colors, with noted stress on the spread of Germanophile sentiment. They notably covered the conflicts between the academics of Bucharest and Iași, in particular the largely unsuccessful attempt of University of Bucharest envoys to attract Iași University staff into a national pro-Entente organization. The project was opposed by the Germanophile group of former socialist Constantin Stere and rendered ineffectual when Stere's own rival, Rector Matei Cantacuzino, also advised against it.\n\nDrafted into the Romanian Land Forces as a military physician, Rodion saw action throughout the Romanian Campaign, retreating with the army into Moldavia after Bucharest fell to the Germans. His activity in the besieged province is said to have been exemplary throughout the period; in 1917, Rodion had reached the rank of Major. Although he had discarded socialism, he was denounced as suspect following the leftist demonstration in Iași that was led by Max Wexler. Reportedly, he was assigned to a secluded army unit on the Tazlău River, while his case was processed. He feared that a death squad would dispose of him, and became an insomniac. He was later stationed in the village of Căiuți, where he read in \"Opinia\" that Fondane's father Isac Wechsler had died. In a letter of condolence he addressed to the Wechslers, Rodion stated: \"here [...] death stalks us with every step and makes us love life.\"\n\nAfter Romania signed a separate peace with the Central Powers, and following the demobilization of summer 1918, Steuerman returned to Iași. Back into civilian life, Rodion was, like George Topîrceanu, one of the combatants whom the war years had rendered even more critical of the Ententist option; from Moldavia, he sent his texts to be published in Stere's explicitly Germanophile review, \"Lumina\", and, at the same time, began contributing to \"Scena\", the daily owned by conscientious objector A. de Herz. \"Lumina\" hosted a second series of his \"Scrisori\", beginning in June 1918. During the same month, Rodion was also a correspondent of the short-lived leftist tribune \"Umanitatea\", launched in Iași by the Bessarabian Germanophile Alexis Nour, and noted for its advocacy of total Jewish emancipation. On July 27, \"Opinia\" published Steuerman's eulogistic commentary on the political essays of Stere's follower Dimitrie D. Pătrășcanu; Pătrășcanu's text, grouped under the headline \"Vinovații\" (\"The Guilty Ones\"), constituted an indictment of both the Entente and the National Liberal Party, Romania's main Ententist group.\n\nAvram Steuerman-Rodion was haunted by memories of the war, and, according to historian Lucian Boia, suffered episodes of clinical depression which he both concealed and left untreated. He was also addicted to hypnotics. His condition steadily deteriorating, Rodion became suicidal. On September 19, 1918, he died after intentionally overdosing on morphine. He left several manuscripts, such as \"Frontul vesel\" (\"The Merry Front\", a collection of sonnets) and \"Însemnări din război\" (\"Notes from the War\").\n\nThe news of Steuerman's suicide shocked his colleagues and friends in the political-literary community. Homages and obituary pieces were printed in various Romanian press venues, including \"Lumina\", \"Scena\" and \"Opinia\"—the latter also featured a special commemorative piece by future novelist Cezar Petrescu, \"La mormântul unui confrate\" (\"At the Tomb of a Brother in Arms\", September 26, 1918). A year later, in his columns for \"Scena\" daily and the Zionist paper \"Mântuirea\", Fondane paid homage to his deceased uncle. These texts linked Rodion's suicide to desperation over the surge of antisemitism, to chronic insomnia, and to gerontophobia.\n\nAccording to literary historian Zigu Ornea, Rodion, a \"minor poet\", was one of the young writers and activists instrumental in supporting the Romanian socialist patriarch Constantin Dobrogeanu-Gherea, who was at the time caught in an ideological dispute with the dominant conservative group \"Junimea\". The other figures listed by Ornea in this context are Stere, Ibrăileanu, Dimitrie Anghel, Anton Bacalbașa, Traian Demetrescu, Emil Fagure, Raicu Ionescu-Rion, Sofia Nădejde and Henric Sanielevici. In his earlier \"Istoria literaturii române\" synthesis, the influential literary critic George Călinescu chose to discuss Rodion and Berman Goldner-Giordano together, as two minor representatives of Dobrogeanu-Gherea's \"tendentious art\". In his 1894 articles, Steuerman defined himself as an advocate of socialist-themed literature, admonishing his colleague Bacalbașa for having strayed away from this path.\n\nSteuerman-Rodion left literary works which bridged socialist tendentiousness with his own cultural priority, Jewish assimilation. One of his poems reflected his dual identity, rendered dichotomous by the spread of antisemitism:\nAccording to Fondane: \"Rodion wanted to live. That is a habit people tend to have, and Rodion wanted life, the same as a leaf of grass or the bird of flight. The son of a people with sideburns and robes, that survives by assimilation with earthworms, with stones, with mankind, with plots of land, his force has bumped [...], like a fly, upon the wall of the world...\" Fondane noted that Rodion, with his \"painfully Romanian style of writing\" at a time when Zionism was still \"vague\", could only opt in favor of erasing his own Jewish identity. Steuerman's Romanian patriotism, frustrated by the antisemitic establishment, led him to write what are arguably his most-quoted lyrics:\nRodion's verses were described as particularly eloquent in depicting the misfortune of Jewish intellectuals who sought integration into Romanian society but were still rejected—the piece is called \"agonizing\" by Zigu Ornea, and \"immortal\" by poet-essayist Radu Cosașu. However, Romanian and Israeli academic Michael Shafir noted that, with similar texts by Ronetti Roman, Steuerman-Rodion's poem mostly reflected the disbelief with which Jewish intellectuals were reacting to the late-19th-century antisemitic barrage. According to Shafir, this reaction was an undignified \"lament\": \"Steuerman-Rodion [...] sounds more like a lover rejected by his woman than a counter-combatant of the socialist persuasion\".\n\nSteuerman won more admiration for his prose. Writing in 2010, Lucian Boia noted that Rodion's \"Scrisori din Iași\" were \"a veritable chronicle\", \"minutely researched and written with talent\". Boia found the overall Germanophile bias of \"Scrisori\" to be palatable: \"the impression they leave is that Iași was sharing in only too little measure the 'Ententist' pathos of Bucharest; an exaggeration of sorts, but also a fair amount of truth.\" An old adversary, Nicolae Iorga, was particularly impressed by Rodion's memoirs from the battlefield. These, Iorga wrote in 1934, are \"deeply sincere and truly emotional\" notes.\n\nAccording to the overall verdict of George Călinescu, Rodion and Giordano were \"insignificant\" contributors to Romanian literature, exclusively preoccupied with \"the Semitic drama\". In the same generation, Șerban Cioculescu reviewed most such socialist poets as \"second-rate\" and \"faint\". Such assessments were later issued by Michael Shafir, according to whom Rodion is \"(justly) forgotten\", and Cosașu, who calls him \"obscure\".\n\nOne to be influenced by Rodion was his own nephew Fondane: according to Ornea, it was Rodion and poet Iacob Ashel Groper who first got Fondane interested in Judaism as a distinct literary subject. Fondane is also believed to have chosen the title of his column in the Zionist journal \"Lumea Evree\", \"Idei și oameni\" (\"Ideas and People\"), as a quote from and homage to Steuerman. In 1919, the same magazine hosted a philosemitic essay by Romanian cultural promoter Gala Galaction, which deplored the marginalization or persecution of Jewish writers, from Barbu Nemțeanu to Rodion. Excluding reprints in the various Romanian magazines, three posthumous selections of Rodion's work were published, as books, after the war: \"Frontul Roșu\" (\"The Red Front\", sonnets, 1920); \"Cartea Băiatului meu\" (\"My Boy's Book\", memoirs, 1924); \"Îndepărtări\" (\"Detachments\", essays, 1936).\n\nRodion's political case resurfaced during polemics launched by the Romanian antisemites and the antisemitic fascists, down to the end of World War II. Poet and Premier Octavian Goga outlined his self-declared hatred for the Jews and call for discriminatory policies in his political tracts, but, unusually in this context, stated that he held no such grudge against either Rodion or Ronetti Roman. According to Radu Cosașu, Rodion's failure to integrate announced the similar drama of 1930s Jewish writer Mihail Sebastian, who wanted to be perceived as Romanian but was in return vilified by the far right. In 1941, the authoritarian regime of Ion Antonescu published a directory of Jewish Romanian authors, living or deceased, whose work was officially banned: Steuerman was included, under the erroneous spelling \"Steverman\".\n\nAlthough negative in substance, the brief profile published in George Călinescu's \"Istoria...\" (first edition 1941), alongside other portraits of Jewish literary men and women, is sometimes referred to as an act of defiance to Antonescu's cultural pronouncements. The goal of recovering Steuerman's contribution was consciously taken up by Jewish scholar and anarchist Eugen Relgis, who wrote about him in one of his own literary essays.\n\n"}

{"id": "40039993", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=40039993", "title": "Cedillo v. Secretary of Health and Human Services", "text": "Cedillo v. Secretary of Health and Human Services\n\nMichelle Cedillo v. Secretary of Health and Human Services, also known as Cedillo, was a court case involving the family of Michelle Cedillo, an autistic girl whose parents sued the United States government because they believed that her autism was caused by her receipt of both the measles-mumps-and-rubella vaccine (also known as the MMR vaccine) and thimerosal-containing vaccines. The case was a part of the Omnibus Autism Proceeding, where petitioners were required to present three test cases for each proposed mechanism by which vaccines had, according to them, caused their children's autism; \"Cedillo\" was the first such case for the MMR-and-thimerosal hypothesis.\n\nThe family sought compensation from the National Vaccine Injury Compensation Program (NVICP), but in order to qualify they were required to prove that it was more likely than not that their children's autism was caused by their vaccines. The scientific community had concluded that vaccines did not cause autism years before the first cases were heard, and concern was therefore expressed that the relatively lax evidentiary standards of the NVICP could lead to compensation being awarded in spite of the compelling scientific evidence to the contrary. This, some vaccine supporters argued, might have serious adverse public health effects by discouraging vaccine manufacturers from producing more childhood vaccines. Though the NVICP had existed since 1988, it was not designed to handle the thousands of cases it received from 1999 to 2007, which led to the establishment of the Omnibus Autism Proceeding in 2002.\n\nThe trial opened on June 11, 2007 in Washington, D. C.. The Cedillos' six expert witnesses argued that thimerosal-containing vaccines degraded Michelle's immune system, which in turn made it possible for the weakened measles virus in the MMR vaccine to cause a persistent infection leading to autism. In support of this hypothesis, the Cedillos' witnesses relied on the reported detection of measles virus in Michelle's gastrointestinal tract by John O'Leary's Unigenetics laboratory in Dublin. However, the government's expert witnesses conclusively demonstrated that O'Leary's positive results were caused by contamination in the Unigenetics lab rather than an actual infection.\n\nOn February 12, 2009, the special masters ruled that the Cedillos were not entitled to compensation as they had failed to demonstrate that thimerosal-containing vaccines in combination with the MMR vaccine could cause autism. The special masters concluded, among other things, that the government's experts were considerably more qualified than those testifying on behalf of the families, with special master George Hastings stating that \"the Cedillos have been misled by physicians who are guilty, in my view, of gross medical misjudgment.\"\n\nThe National Vaccine Injury Compensation Program was established in 1988 in the United States by the passing of the National Childhood Vaccine Injury Act, and is funded by a 75-cent tax on each vaccine dose. The program's aims were to maintain a steady supply of vaccines while, at the same time, allowing victims of vaccine injury to be compensated more efficiently than was previously possible. The program operates according to a no-fault principle. The family of Michelle Cedillo sought compensation from this program. Cedillo, a then 12-year-old female wheelchair user from Yuma, Arizona, was involved in the first of three test cases chosen by the government to represent the approximately 4,900 other vaccine-autism cases that had been brought before the court. Michelle Cedillo was born on August 30, 1994, and received thimerosal-containing vaccines during the first fifteen months of her life. On December 20, 1995, she received an MMR vaccine. Theresa and Michael Cedillo filed a vaccine injury claim on behalf of their daughter on December 9, 1998 for encephalopathy, but on January 14, 2002, changed their petition to a causation-in-fact claim, meaning they were arguing that Michelle developed autism as a result of the combined effects of thimerosal and the MMR vaccine. They did this as a result of a meeting that had taken place the previous year, between Theresa Cedillo and Andrew Wakefield, at a Defeat Autism Now! conference.\n\nIn 2001, many other families also filed suit in the NVICP, also because they believed their children's autism had been caused by vaccines and they were therefore entitled to compensation. The following year, the Office of Special Masters of the United States Court of Federal Claims held a series of meetings to decide how to deal with these claims, and that July, issued an order establishing the Omnibus Autism Proceeding. According to the Cedillos, Michelle was developmentally normal until she received her MMR vaccine at the age of 15 months, at which point she developed a 105-degree fever, began vomiting and developed diarrhea. Michelle was diagnosed with autism 18 months after receiving her MMR vaccine. According to the \"Washington Post\", the legal standard to which the cases were subjected in this trial meant that \"the outcome will hinge not on scientific standards of evidence but on a legal standard of plausibility—what one lawyer for the families called '50 percent and a feather'.\" It was in 2002 that, given the large number of litigants seeking compensation from the NVICP, the Omnibus Autism Proceeding was established. Its aim was to resolve pending vaccine-autism claims \"aggressively but fairly.\"\n\nPrior to the Cedillo case beginning, the scientific community had conducted considerable research into the hypothesized link between either the MMR vaccine and autism or thimerosal-containing vaccines and autism. This research had consistently come to the conclusion that no such link existed. However, some vaccine supporters, such as Paul Offit, argued that the standards for proving a vaccine had \"caused\" an adverse effect in the NVICP were far too low, and that the court might therefore find in favor of the Cedillos anyway. They also argued that if this happened, the vaccine manufacturers might be discouraged from manufacturing childhood vaccines, which might lead to more frequent vaccine shortages.\n\nIn the Cedillo case, her family claimed that Michelle was normal until receiving her vaccines, as evidenced by a number of videos of her between the age of 6 and 8 months. They also argued that thimerosal-containing vaccines degraded her immune system, which made it possible for the measles virus to infect her and cause autism and the other health problems from which she suffers, which include inflammatory bowel disease, glaucoma and epilepsy. The evidence presented for this consisted primarily of the detection of measles virus in Michelle Cedillo's GI tract. According to the testimony of Marcel Kinsbourne, a pediatric neurologist and professor of psychology at the New School, the vaccine strain of measles virus caused autism by \"... infect[ing] the gut and enter[ing] the brain, causing dysfunction of astrocytes and other brain cells, which in turn provokes high levels of the neurotransmitter glutamate, causing a state of overstimulation which manifests itself in the symptoms of autism.\"\n\nThe witnesses testifying on behalf of the state whose testimony attracted the most attention were Éric Fombonne, a psychiatrist at McGill University, Jeffrey Brent, a medical toxicologist at the University of Colorado Health Sciences Center, and Stephen Bustin of Queen Mary University of London. Other experts who testified on behalf of the state included Edwin Cook, a psychiatrist, Diane Griffin, a virologist at Johns Hopkins University, Stephen Hanauer, a gastroenterologist, Christine McCusker, a pediatric immunologist, Brian Ward, a virologist who, along with Fombonne, published some research which failed to replicate the Unigenetics lab's results, and Max Wiznitzer, a pediatric neurologist.\n\nThose who testified on behalf of the plaintiffs were H. Vasken Aposhian, a toxicologist at the University of Arizona, Arthur Krigsman, a gastroenterologist at the Johnson Center for Child Health and Development, Karin Hepner, a molecular biologist at Wake Forest University, Vera Byers, a retired immunologist, Ronald C. Kennedy, a virus immunologist at Texas Tech University and Marcel Kinsbourne, a retired pediatric neurologist.\n\nOn June 11, 2007, the plaintiffs presented their first argument, in which they contended that Michelle Cedillo, as well as other children with autism, suffered from a \"mercury efflux disorder\" which was described by Aposhian, their first expert witness, as \"a problem with getting a metal, in this case mercury, out of a cell.\" As evidence that such disorders have been documented before, he pointed to Wilson's disease. Aposhian based this claim, in part, on three peer-reviewed papers. The first such study was co-authored by Boyd Haley, and concluded that hair of children with autism contained less mercury than that of children without autism. Aposhian stated that \"we know that the hair is an excretory organ and that the hair is reflective of the mercury or the metal in the blood, and the blood is a reflection of the mercury in the tissues, and so the fact that the children with autism had less mercury in their hair was a hint or indication that perhaps there was mercury efflux disorder.\" The second of these studies was conducted by James B. Adams, and found that baby teeth of children with autism had more than twice as much mercury as those of children without autism. Aposhian cited this study as evidence that \"autistic children have a greater body burden of mercury.\" Another study which Aposhian used to back up this statement was one conducted by Jeff Bradstreet and Mark Geier, which gave dimercaptosuccinic acid, a chelating agent, to children and concluded that children with autism excreted much more mercury thereafter than children without autism. Aposhian also cited a number of in vitro studies as evidence that thimerosal could cause immune system dysregulation.\n\nThe following day, the plaintiffs presented their second argument, namely that the measles vaccine had caused intestinal damage. Their witness that day was gastroenterologist Arthur Krigsman, who testified that his opinion in the case depended on whether measles virus had really been detected in the intestinal tissue of Michelle Cedillo and other children with autism by the Unigenetics lab, using a study conducted by him, Dr. Hepner, Steve Walker, and Jeff Segal as evidence that the Unigenetics lab's results were reliable. This study, however, was still in its preliminary stages at the time of the trial, and had only been presented as a poster at the International Meeting for Autism Research the year before, and Walker himself warned that \"We haven't done anything to demonstrate that the measles virus is causing autism or even causing bowel disease.\"\n\nOn the trial's third day, the plaintiffs presented their next argument, which was that the Uhlmann paper, which had reported the presence of vaccine-strain measles virus in the GI tract of children with autism, used reliable PCR techniques to detect said virus. Their witness for that day was molecular biologist Karin Hepner, who testified that \"... the positive and negative controls used by the Uhlmann authors [led by Dr. John J. O'Leary, who runs the Unigenetics lab in Dublin] were appropriate, that the operating procedure employed in the testing was appropriate to minimize the possibility of \"contamination,\" and that the \"assays\" utilized were appropriately selected and implemented.\" She also contended that the two studies that had failed to replicate the Uhlmann paper's results were flawed for two reasons: because they looked at cells of children with autism rather than in their GI tract, and because they did not test children with autism with gastrointestinal dysfunction.\n\nImmunologist Vera Byers testified that Michelle Cedillo had a dysregulated immune system, which allowed the measles virus to persist in her system, and that her malfunctioning immune system was in part a result of the virus itself. She also stated that this dysregulation was caused by \"a combination of genetics and the measles virus vaccination and the thimerosal-containing vaccines that she had received.\"\n\nViral immunologist Ronald C. Kennedy testified that Michelle Cedillo had a \"selective immune dysfunction\". He also, like Dr. Hepner, testified that the Unigenetics lab was reliable and followed appropriate measures to prevent contamination, stating \"that the laboratory of Dr. John O'Leary, Dr. Orla Sheils, and their colleagues has a good reputation.\" Kennedy also testified that he attended a meeting during which Dr. Cotter orally reported that his testing reached results similar to those reported by Uhlmann. However, he also acknowledged that this lab never published sequencing data, which is in line with the fact that the Uhlmann paper does not mention the sequencing process.\n\nRetired pediatric neurologist Marcel Kinsbourne testified that Michelle was developing normally until December 20, 1995, when she was vaccinated with the MMR vaccine, and that the fever and rash she experienced shortly thereafter was caused by this vaccine. He also testified that Michelle had regressive autism, and that \"since Michelle has experienced both chronic gastrointestinal problems and the chronic neurologic disorder known as autism, the most reasonable conclusion is that a single causative agent--i.e., the vaccine-strain measles virus--is the cause of both chronic conditions.\"\n\nOne of the key lines of evidence presented by the Cedillo family was that Michelle was developmentally normal before she received the MMR vaccine. This, they claimed, was evident from videos taken of her when she was 6 to 8 months old. However, Eric Fombonne testified that Michelle \"... displayed early signs of autism clearly visibly on family video taken prior to her receiving the MMR vaccine.\"\nJeffrey Brent, the past president of the American Academy of Clinical Toxicology, was invited to testify about the potential role of thimerosal-containing vaccines in triggering Michelle's autism. He stated that \"there was not a single study indicating that any form of mercury could cause serious neurological symptoms in the dosages that were used in vaccines\" and criticized Aposhian's use of in vitro studies and his equating them to what happens in the actual animal, arguing that \"the exposure to a cell in a petri dish was far more likely to cause damage than an equivalent dosage in a living system.\" With regard to specific in vitro studies, Brent argued that the Goth study was flawed because it tested thimerosal on mouse cells, not human cells; because these cells were exposed not to ethylmercury, as the human body would be after receiving a thimerosal-containing vaccine since thimerosal is quickly metabolized to ethylmercury, but to thimerosal itself, and because the cells were exposed to far higher concentrations of thimerosal than could ever occur as a result of the administration of thimerosal-containing vaccines. Brent highlighted similar problems with the Agrawal study, noting that the cells in that study, like those in the Goth study, were exposed to thimerosal, not ethylmercury, and to much higher doses than found in vaccines. He also examined the Bradstreet and Geier study and the Holmes study, noting that \"much better studies from other investigators could not replicate the results of either the Holmes study or the Bradstreet/Geier study,\" citing two other peer-reviewed papers which had concluded that hair mercury levels were not significantly different between study participants with autism and controls, as well as a study which had concluded that children with autism had \"no\" chelatable heavy-metal body burden whatsoever. Brent also pointed out that, like another of Bradstreet's studies, the Bradstreet-Geier study had been published in a non-indexed journal, the \"Journal of American Physicians and Surgeons\", which he described as \"very much of a fringe journal with lots of alternative agendas, and it's not even indexed by the National Library of Medicine.\" Brent concluded by testifying that thimerosal could not have degraded Michelle's immune system to the extent that when she was vaccinated with MMR nine months later, it caused brain damage, saying \"That couldn't possibly be the case.\" In the second set of the proceedings, which pertained to thimerosal alone (as opposed to thimerosal working in conjunction with MMR), Brent testified, with regard to Jordan King and one other child with autism who also served as a test case in this trial, that there was \"absolutely no reason to chelate them for any mercury-related reason.\"\n\nMany of the plaintiff's experts also relied on the reported detection of measles virus RNA in Michelle's intestinal tissue. This claim was based on results from O'Leary's Unigenetics lab, and was examined by Stephen Bustin, a world-renowned expert on polymerase chain reaction who has authored a number of scientific papers on the subject, as well as a book entitled A-Z of Quantitative PCR. He pointed out that this is based on results from the O'Leary lab, and concluded, based on a 2002 paper by Uhlmann that described their PCR methodology, that this lab contained a lot of contaminating DNA, and that the assays were actually detecting this DNA rather than the RNA which makes up the measles virus. Bustin pointed out that, among other things, O'Leary's Unigenetics lab which published this study neglected to use controls, and also did not discuss contamination. For this reason, Bustin concluded that it was a \"scientific certainty\" that none of the children's samples analyzed by the Unigenetics lab actually contained the measles virus. In addition, Bustin and Bertus Rima both testified that Cotter was unable to replicate the Unigenetics lab's results, in contrast to Kennedy's claim that they were able to replicate these results.\nByers' testimony was countered by that of Christine McCusker, who testified that \"Dr. Byers had compared the results from several of the tests on Michelle to a set of \"normal\" values for such tests. The normal values utilized by Dr. Byers, however, were for adults, not children\" and that \"when she herself instead compared Michelle's results to an age-adjusted set of normal values, Michelle's results fell within the normal ranges,\" with McCusker noting in her expert report that the only marker of Th2 cell activity that was assessed in Michelle's case, namely serum Immunoglobulin E level, was entirely normal. Additionally, Ward's expert report stated that Byers' expert report contained \"many statements that appear to be entirely unsubstantiated.\"\n\nKinsbourne's testimony was countered by that of Ward, who noted that if Kinsbourne were correct and persisting measles virus were causing autism, then it ought to be detectable in the blood, since Kinsbourne himself had stated that MV would travel throughout the body via the bloodstream; he also criticized Kinsbourne's expert report for citing Bradstreet et al.'s case series which had been published in the \"Journal of American Physicians and Surgeons\". With regard to this study, Ward said that \"the cerebrospinal antibody data from the three ASD children included in this manuscript actually argue powerfully AGAINST a persistent measles infection in the brains of these children.\" Ward also noted that Krigsman had cited research conducted by Vijendra K. Singh of Utah State University which had concluded that more than 80% of children with autism had elevated measles antibodies. However, Ward stated in his expert report that \"Unless virtually all cases of autism are caused by measles virus (a position expressly excluded by the MRC, IOM and Cochrane reports), then Singh's work must be in error or there must be an alternate explanation for this finding. We have recently tested anti-measles antibodies in children with ASD and found no differences with control children.\" Another point of contention was a paper by Paul Ashwood, which had been cited by Kinsbourne in his expert report; however, as Ward noted, Kinsbourne had neglected to mention that Ashwood's paper concluded that \"the overwhelming majority of epidemiological, population studies indicate there is no established correlation between vaccinations and autism.\" Additionally, Ward noted that this paper made no mention of the potential link between MMR and autism.\n\nOn February 12, 2009, the three special masters each ruled against the petitioners' causation claims. In his decision, George Hastings noted that, unlike Aposhian, Jeffrey Brent, who testified that there was no evidence that children with autism were uniquely susceptible to mercury exposure, was a medical doctor. Hastings also described Dr. Brent's testimony as \"persuasive.\" In addition, with regard to the theory that some children are genetically hypersusceptible to mercury toxicity, Hastings concluded that the \"petitioners have failed to demonstrate that this theory has any validity.\" According to Hastings' decision, Byers' testimony \"was far outweighed by the testimony of Dr. Brent and respondent's other witnesses ...\"; he also concluded that \"her insistence that it was acceptable to use adult norms to measure the immune function of infants and young children was, frankly, incredible.\" Hastings also wrote that Kennedy made the same mistake that Byers made—namely, comparing the measurements of Michelle's immune system to the parameters for adults, and that while Kennedy testified that Cotter's results were evidence of the Unigenetics lab's testing, that \"no conclusions can reasonably be drawn\" regarding these results, noting that they had not yet been published. After examining Kinsbourne's testimony, Hastings concluded that it contained \"... contradictions and inconsistencies ... concerning the appropriate time period between MMR vaccination and onset of autism symptoms,\" and also noted that Kinsbourne had not included measles virus as a cause of autism in a chart he wrote for a textbook, but had done so in the proceedings.\n\nHastings, in his decision, noted that \"all of the petitioners' causation theories depend upon the validity of certain testing that purported to find evidence of persisting measles virus in the biological materials of Michelle and a number of other children with autism.\" However, Hastings concluded that this testing was \"not reliable.\" In his decision, he noted that the authors of the D'Souza paper first performed PCR on PBMCs from children with autism, which resulted in a large proportion of apparently positive results. However, \"the D'Souza group ... subjected those apparently positive samples to additional testing techniques in order to determine whether the PCR testing using the Uhlmann primers was truly identifying measles virus and only measles virus. ... The application of those two techniques revealed that all but nine of the samples that had initially tested positive by the PCR test using the Uhlmann primers were, in fact, not measles virus.\" With regard to the 9 remaining samples, the D'Souza paper performed sequencing on 7 of those samples. This step \"demonstrated that the material, which in the PCR testing had appeared to be measles virus material, was in fact not measles virus material, but human genetic material.\"\n\nWith regard to the Michelle Cedillo case in general, Hastings concluded that \"The evidence was overwhelmingly contrary to the petitioners' contentions.\" He also said that the Cedillo family had been \"misled by physicians who are guilty, in my view, of gross medical misjudgment.\" The Cedillos appealed this case in March 2009, but the court upheld its dismissal thereof in August 2010.\n\nIn response to the second rulings in 2010, SafeMinds stated, \"The denial of reasonable compensation to families was based on inadequate vaccine safety science and poorly designed and highly controversial epidemiology.\" Similarly, Rebecca Estepp of the Coalition for Vaccine Safety said in a statement, \"The deck is stacked against families in vaccine court. Government attorneys defend a government program, using government-funded science, before government judges,\" and Generation Rescue's J.B. Handley argued that \"the courts won't concede something that will bring down the vaccination program.\"\n\nOn the other hand, vaccine scientists praised the ruling, with Paul Offit stating \"the autism theory had 'already had its day in science court and failed to hold up. Additionally, Autism Speaks said that \"the proven benefits of vaccinating a child to protect them against serious diseases far outweigh the hypothesized risk that vaccinations might cause autism. Thus, we strongly encourage parents to vaccinate their children to protect them from serious childhood diseases.\" The Department of Health and Human Services released a statement saying that \"Hopefully, the determination by the special masters will help reassure parents that vaccines do not cause autism.\" Similarly, the chairman of the American Medical Association stated that the \"recent rulings by the Special Masters of the U.S. Court of Federal Claims provide even more overwhelming evidence that there is no association between vaccines and autism or related disorders.\"\n\nAfter the ruling, Keelan and Wilson wrote that, in contrast to those who argued that the proceedings gave unnecessary publicity to the scientifically unsupported vaccine-autism hypothesis, \"the NVICP was successful in its management of these proceedings and met the intent of the original legislation to protect the integrity of the vaccine supply, maintain public confidence in immunization, and provide those injured with a fair hearing.\"\n\n\n"}

{"id": "938031", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=938031", "title": "Cock rock", "text": "Cock rock\n\nCock rock is a genre of rock music that emphasises a form of male sexuality. The style, developed in the later 1960s, came to prominence in the 1970s and 1980s, and it continues into the 21st century.\n\nCock rock is a musical genre. Philip Auslander uses Simon Frith's description of cock rock characteristics:\n\"cock-rock performance means an explicit, crude, 'masterful' expression of sexuality ... Cock-rock performers are aggressive, boastful, constantly drawing audience attention to their prowess and control. Their bodies are on display ... mikes and guitars are phallic symbols (or else caressed like female bodies), the music is loud, rhythmically insistent, built around techniques of arousal and release. Lyrics are assertive and arrogant, but the exact words are less significant than the vocal styles involved, the shrill shouting and screaming.\"\n\nThe meaning of the term \"cock rock\" has changed over time. It was first mentioned by an anonymous author in the New York-based underground feminist publication \"Rat\" in 1970, to describe the male dominated music industry and became a synonym for hard rock, emphasising the aggressive expression of male sexuality, often misogynist lyrics and use of phallic imagery. The term was used by sociologists Simon Frith and Angela McRobbie in 1978 to point to the contrast between male dominated sub-culture of cock rock which was \"aggressive, dominating and boastful\" and the more feminised teenybop stars of pop music. Led Zeppelin have been described as \"the quintessential purveyors of 'cock rock'\". Other formative acts include the Rolling Stones, The Who and Jim Morrison of The Doors.\n\nIn 1981, Frith described the characteristics of cock rock in a way that could apply to female performers, not just male ones. In 2004, Auslander used this description of cock-rock characteristics to show that Suzi Quatro (the first female bass player to become a major rock star) is a female cock-rocker.\n\nSince the 1980s, the term has been sometimes interchangeable with hair metal or glam metal. Examples of this genre include: Mötley Crüe, Ratt, Warrant, Extreme, Cinderella, Pretty Boy Floyd, Jackyl, L.A. Guns, and Poison. Despite the name, many of these bands had or have large numbers of female fans. The spoof documentary \"This Is Spinal Tap\" is an acclaimed parody of the genre. In the 21st century, there was a revival of the genre with the sleaze metal movement in Sweden, with acts including Vains of Jenna.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "23494736", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=23494736", "title": "Common factors theory", "text": "Common factors theory\n\nCommon factors theory, a theory guiding some research in clinical psychology and counseling psychology, proposes that different approaches and evidence-based practices in psychotherapy and counseling share \"common factors\" that account for much of the effectiveness of a psychological treatment. This is in contrast to the view that the effectiveness of psychotherapy and counseling is best explained by specific or unique factors (notably, particular methods or procedures) that are suited to treatment of particular problems. According to one review, \"it is widely recognized that the debate between common and unique factors in psychotherapy represents a false dichotomy, and these factors must be integrated to maximize effectiveness\". In other words, \"therapists must engage in specific forms of therapy for common factors to have a medium through which to operate\". Common factors is one route by which psychotherapy researchers have attempted to integrate psychotherapies.\n\nSaul Rosenzweig started the conversation on common factors in an article published in 1936 that discussed some psychotherapies of his time. John Dollard and Neal E. Miller's 1950 book \"Personality and Psychotherapy\" emphasized that the psychological principles and social conditions of learning are the most important common factors. Sol Garfield (who would later go on to edit many editions of the \"Handbook of Psychotherapy and Behavior Change\" with Allen Bergin) included a 10-page discussion of common factors in his 1957 textbook \"Introductory Clinical Psychology\". In the same year, Carl Rogers published a paper outlining what he considered to be common factors (which he called \"sufficient conditions\") of successful therapeutic personality change, emphasizing the therapeutic relationship factors which would become central to the theory of person-centered therapy.\n\nIn 1961, Jerome Frank published \"Persuasion and Healing\", a book entirely devoted to examining the common factors among psychotherapies and related healing approaches. Frank emphasized the importance of (1) the expectation of help (a component of the placebo effect), (2) the therapeutic relationship, (3) a rationale or conceptual scheme that explains the given symptoms and prescribes a given ritual or procedure for resolving them, and (4) the active participation of both patient and therapist in carrying out that ritual or procedure.\n\nAfter Lester Luborsky and colleagues published a literature review of empirical studies of psychotherapy outcomes in 1975, the idea that all psychotherapies are effective became known as the Dodo bird verdict, referring to a scene from \"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland\" quoted by Rosenzweig in his 1936 article; in that scene, after the characters race and everyone wins, the Dodo bird says, \"everybody has won, and all must have prizes.\" Luborsky's research was an attempt (and not the first attempt, nor the last one) to disprove Hans Eysenck's 1952 study on the efficacy of psychotherapy; Eysenck found that psychotherapy generally did not seem to lead to improved patient outcomes. A number of studies after 1975 presented more evidence in support of the general efficacy of psychotherapy, but the question of how common and specific factors could enhance or thwart therapy effectiveness in particular cases continued to fuel theoretical and empirical research over the following decades.\n\nThe landmark 1982 book \"Converging Themes in Psychotherapy\" gathered a number of chapters by different authors promoting common factors, including an introduction by Marvin R. Goldfried and Wendy Padawer, a reprint of Rosenzweig's 1936 article, and further chapters (some of them reprints) by John Dollard and Neal E. Miller, Franz Alexander, Jerome Frank, Arnold Lazarus, Hans Herrman Strupp, Sol Garfield, John Paul Brady, Judd Marmor, Paul L. Wachtel, Abraham Maslow, Arnold P. Goldstein, Anthony Ryle, and others. The chapter by Goldfried and Padawer distinguished between three levels of intervention in therapy:\n\nGoldfried and Padawer argued that while therapists may talk about their \"theories\" using very different jargon, there is more commonality among skilled therapists at the (intermediate) level of \"principles\" or strategies. Goldfried and Padawer's emphasis on principles or strategies of change was an important contribution to common factors theory because they clearly showed how principles or strategies can be considered common factors (they are shared by therapists who may espouse different theories of change) and specific factors (they are manifested in particular ways within different approaches) at the same time. Around the same time, James O. Prochaska and colleagues, who were developing the transtheoretical model of change, proposed ten \"processes of change\" that categorized \"multiple techniques, methods, and interventions traditionally associated with disparate theoretical orientations,\" and they stated that their processes of change corresponded to Goldfried and Padawer's level of common principles of change.\n\nIn 1986, David Orlinsky and Kenneth Howard presented their \"generic model of psychotherapy\", which proposed that five process variables are active in any psychotherapy: the therapeutic contract, therapeutic interventions, the therapeutic bond between therapist and patient, the patient's and therapist's states of self-relatedness, and therapeutic realization.\n\nIn 1990, Lisa Grencavage and John C. Norcross reviewed accounts of common factors in 50 publications, with 89 common factors in all, from which Grencavage and Norcross selected the 35 most common factors and grouped them into five areas: client characteristics, therapist qualities, change processes, treatment structure, and therapeutic relationship. In the same year, Larry E. Beutler and colleagues published their \"systematic treatment selection model\", which attempted to integrate common and specific factors into a single model that therapists could use to guide treatment, considering variables of patient dimensions, environments, settings, therapist dimensions, and treatment types. Beutler and colleagues would later describe their approach as \"identifying common and differential principles of change\".\n\nIn 1992, Michael J. Lambert summarized psychotherapy outcome research and grouped the factors of successful therapy into four areas, ordered by hypothesized percent of change in clients as a function of therapeutic factors: first, \"extratherapeutic change\" (40%), those factors that are qualities of the client or qualities of his or her environment and that aid in recovery regardless of his or her participation in therapy; second, \"common factors\" (30%) that are found in a variety of therapy approaches, such as empathy and the therapeutic relationship; third, \"expectancy\" (15%), the portion of improvement that results from the client's expectation of help or belief in the rationale or effectiveness of therapy; fourth, \"techniques\" (15%), those factors unique to specific therapies and tailored to treatment of specific problems. Lambert's research later inspired a book on common factors theory in the practice of therapy titled \"The Heart and Soul of Change\".\n\nIn the mid-1990s, as managed care in mental health services became more widespread in the United States, more researchers began to investigate the efficacy of psychotherapy in terms of \"empirically supported treatments\" (ESTs) for particular problems, emphasizing randomized controlled trials as the gold standard of empirical support for a treatment. In 1995, the American Psychological Association's Division 12 (clinical psychology) formed a task force that developed lists of empirically supported treatments for particular problems such as agoraphobia, blood-injection-injury type phobia, generalized anxiety disorder, obsessive–compulsive disorder, panic disorder, etc. In 2001, Bruce Wampold published \"The Great Psychotherapy Debate\", a book that criticized what he considered to be an overemphasis on ESTs for particular problems, and he called for continued research in common factors theory.\n\nIn the 2000s, more research began to be published on common factors in couples therapy and family therapy.\n\nIn 2014, a series of ten articles on common factors theory was published in the APA journal \"Psychotherapy\". The articles emphasized the compatibility between ESTs and common factors theory, highlighted the importance of multiple variables in psychotherapy effectiveness, called for more empirical research on common factors (especially client and therapist variables), and argued that individual therapists can do much to improve the quality of therapy by rigorously using feedback measures (during treatment) and outcome measures (after termination of treatment). The article by Stefan G. Hofmann and David H. Barlow, two prominent researchers in cognitive behavioral therapy, pointed out how their recent shift in emphasis from distinct procedures for different diagnoses to a transdiagnostic approach was increasingly similar to common factors theory.\n\nThere are many models of common factors in successful psychotherapy process and outcome. Already in 1990, Grencavage and Norcross identified 89 common factors in a literature review, which showed the diversity of models of common factors. To be useful for purposes of psychotherapy practice and training, most models reduce the number of common factors to a handful, typically around five. Frank listed six common factors in 1971 and explained their interaction. Goldfried and Padawer listed five common strategies or principles in 1982: corrective experiences and new behaviors, feedback from the therapist to the client promoting new understanding in the client, expectation that psychotherapy will be helpful, establishment of the desired therapeutic relationship, and ongoing reality testing by the client. Grencavage and Norcross grouped common factors into five areas in 1990. Lambert formulated four groups of therapeutic factors in 1992. Joel Weinberger and Cristina Rasco listed five common factors in 2007 and reviewed the empirical support for each factor: the therapeutic relationship, expectations of treatment effectiveness, confronting or facing the problem (exposure), mastery or control experiences, and patients' attributions of successful outcome to internal or external causes.\n\nTerence Tracy and colleagues modified the common factors of Grencavage and Norcross, and used them to develop a questionnaire which they provided to 16 board certified psychologists and 5 experienced psychotherapy researchers; then they analyzed the responses and published the results in 2003. Their multidimensional scaling analysis represented the results on a two-dimensional graph, with one dimension representing hot processing versus cool processing (roughly, closeness and emotional experience versus technical information and persuasion) and the other dimension representing therapeutic activity. Their cluster analysis represented the results as three clusters: the first related to bond (roughly, therapeutic alliance), the second related to information (roughly, the meanings communicated between therapist and client), and the third related to role (roughly, a logical structure so that clients can make sense of the therapy process).\n\nIn addition to these models that incorporate multiple common factors, a number of theorists have proposed and investigated single common factors, common principles, and common mechanisms of change, such as learning. In one example, at least three independent groups have converged on the conclusion that a wide variety of different psychotherapies can be integrated via their common ability to trigger the neurobiological mechanism of memory reconsolidation. For further examples, see , below.\n\nWhile many models of common factors have been proposed, they have not all received the same amount of empirical research. There is general consensus on the importance of a good therapeutic relationship in all forms of psychotherapy and counseling.\n\nA review of common factors research in 2008 suggested that 30% to 70% of the variance in therapy outcome was due to common factors. A summary of research in 2014 suggested that 11.5% of variance in therapy outcome was due to the common factor of goal consensus/collaboration, 9% was due to empathy, 7.5% was due to therapeutic alliance, 6.3% was due to positive regard/affirmation, 5.7% was due to congruence/genuineness, and 5% was due to therapist factors; in contrast, treatment method accounted for roughly 1% of outcome variance.\n\nAlan E. Kazdin has argued that psychotherapy researchers must not only find statistical evidence that certain factors contribute to successful outcomes; they must also be able to fomulate evidence-based explanations for how and why those factors contribute to successful outcomes, that is, the mechanisms through which successful psychotherapy leads to change. Common factors theory has been dominated by research on psychotherapy process and outcome variables, and there is a need for further work explaining the mechanisms of psychotherapy common factors in terms of emerging theoretical and empirical research in the neurosciences and social sciences, just as earlier works such as Dollard and Miller's \"Personality and Psychotherapy\" or Frank's \"Persuasion and Healing\" explained psychotherapy common factors in terms of the sciences of their time.\n\nOne frontier for future research on common factors is automated computational analysis of clinical big data.\n\nThere are several criticisms of common factors theory: for example, that common factors theory dismisses the need for specific therapeutic techniques or procedures, that common factors are nothing more than a good therapeutic relationship, and that common factors theory is not scientific. Some common factors theorists have argued that these criticisms are based on a limited knowledge of the common factors literature; a thorough review of the literature shows that a coherent treatment procedure is a crucial medium for the common factors to operate, that most models of common factors define interactions between multiple variables (including but not limited to therapeutic relationship variables), and that some models of common factors provide evidence-based explanations for the mechanisms of the proposed common factors.\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "10013", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=10013", "title": "Evidence-based medicine", "text": "Evidence-based medicine\n\nEvidence-based medicine (EBM) is an approach to medical practice intended to optimize decision-making by emphasizing the use of evidence from well-designed and well-conducted research. Although all medicine based on science has some degree of empirical support, EBM goes further, classifying evidence by its epistemologic strength and requiring that only the strongest types (coming from meta-analyses, systematic reviews, and randomized controlled trials) can yield strong recommendations; weaker types (such as from case-control studies) can yield only weak recommendations. The term was originally used to describe an approach to teaching the practice of medicine and improving decisions by individual physicians about individual patients. Use of the term rapidly expanded to include a previously described approach that emphasized the use of evidence in the design of guidelines and policies that apply to groups of patients and populations (\"evidence-based practice policies\"). It has subsequently spread to describe an approach to decision-making that is used at virtually every level of health care as well as other fields (evidence-based practice).\n\nWhether applied to medical education, decisions about individuals, guidelines and policies applied to populations, or administration of health services in general, evidence-based medicine advocates that to the greatest extent possible, decisions and policies should be based on evidence, not just the beliefs of practitioners, experts, or administrators. It thus tries to assure that a clinician's opinion, which may be limited by knowledge gaps or biases, is supplemented with all available knowledge from the scientific literature so that best practice can be determined and applied. It promotes the use of formal, explicit methods to analyze evidence and makes it available to decision makers. It promotes programs to teach the methods to medical students, practitioners, and policy makers.\n\nIn its broadest form, evidence-based medicine is the application of the scientific method into healthcare decision-making. Medicine has a long tradition of both basic and clinical research that dates back at least to Avicenna and more recently to protestant reformation exegesis of the 17th and 18th centuries. An early critique of statistical methods in medicine was published in 1835.\n\nHowever, until recently, the process by which research results were incorporated in medical decisions was highly subjective. Called \"clinical judgment\" and \"the art of medicine\", the traditional approach to making decisions about individual patients depended on having each individual physician determine what research evidence, if any, to consider, and how to merge that evidence with personal beliefs and other factors. In the case of decisions which applied to groups of patients or populations, the guidelines and policies would usually be developed by committees of experts, but there was no formal process for determining the extent to which research evidence should be considered or how it should be merged with the beliefs of the committee members. There was an implicit assumption that decision makers and policy makers would incorporate evidence in their thinking appropriately, based on their education, experience, and ongoing study of the applicable literature.\n\nBeginning in the late 1960s, several flaws became apparent in the traditional approach to medical decision-making. Alvan Feinstein's publication of \"Clinical Judgment\" in 1967 focused attention on the role of clinical reasoning and identified biases that can affect it. In 1972, Archie Cochrane published \"Effectiveness and Efficiency\", which described the lack of controlled trials supporting many practices that had previously been assumed to be effective. In 1973, John Wennberg began to document wide variations in how physicians practiced. Through the 1980s, David M. Eddy described errors in clinical reasoning and gaps in evidence. In the mid 1980s, Alvin Feinstein, David Sackett and others published textbooks on clinical epidemiology, which translated epidemiological methods to physician decision making. Toward the end of the 1980s, a group at RAND showed that large proportions of procedures performed by physicians were considered inappropriate even by the standards of their own experts. These areas of research increased awareness of the weaknesses in medical decision making at the level of both individual patients and populations, and paved the way for the introduction of evidence-based methods.\n\nThe term \"evidence-based medicine\", as it is currently used, has two main tributaries. Chronologically, the first is the insistence on explicit evaluation of evidence of effectiveness when issuing clinical practice guidelines and other population-level policies. The second is the introduction of epidemiological methods into medical education and individual patient-level decision-making.\n\nThe term \"evidence-based\" was first used by David M. Eddy in the course of his work on population-level policies such as clinical practice guidelines and insurance coverage of new technologies. He first began to use the term \"evidence-based\" in 1987 in workshops and a manual commissioned by the Council of Medical Specialty Societies to teach formal methods for designing clinical practice guidelines. The manual was widely available in unpublished form in the late 1980s and eventually published by the American College of Medicine. Eddy first published the term \"evidence-based\" in March, 1990 in an article in the \"Journal of the American Medical Association\" that laid out the principles of evidence-based guidelines and population-level policies, which Eddy described as \"explicitly describing the available evidence that pertains to a policy and tying the policy to evidence. Consciously anchoring a policy, not to current practices or the beliefs of experts, but to experimental evidence. The policy must be consistent with and supported by evidence. The pertinent evidence must be identified, described, and analyzed. The policymakers must determine whether the policy is justified by the evidence. A rationale must be written.\" He discussed \"evidence-based\" policies in several other papers published in \"JAMA\" in the spring of 1990. Those papers were part of a series of 28 published in \"JAMA\" between 1990 and 1997 on formal methods for designing population-level guidelines and policies.\n\nThe term \"evidence-based medicine\" was introduced slightly later, in the context of medical education. This branch of evidence-based medicine has its roots in clinical epidemiology. In the autumn of 1990, Gordon Guyatt used it in an unpublished description of a program at McMaster University for prospective or new medical students. Guyatt and others first published the term two years later (1992) to describe a new approach to teaching the practice of medicine.\n\nIn 1996, David Sackett and colleagues clarified the definition of this tributary of evidence-based medicine as \"the conscientious, explicit and judicious use of current best evidence in making decisions about the care of individual patients. ... [It] means integrating individual clinical expertise with the best available external clinical evidence from systematic research.\" This branch of evidence-based medicine aims to make individual decision making more structured and objective by better reflecting the evidence from research. Population-based data are applied to the care of an individual patient, while respecting the fact that practitioners have clinical expertise reflected in effective and efficient diagnosis and thoughtful identification and compassionate use of individual patients' predicaments, rights, and preferences.\n\nThis tributary of evidence-based medicine had its foundations in clinical epidemiology, a discipline that teaches health care workers how to apply clinical and epidemiological research studies to their practices. Between 1993 and 2000, the Evidence-based Medicine Working Group at McMaster University published the methods to a broad physician audience in a series of 25 \"Users’ Guides to the Medical Literature\" in \"JAMA\". In 1995 Rosenberg and Donald defined individual level evidence-based medicine as \"the process of finding, appraising, and using contemporaneous research findings as the basis for medical decisions.\" In 2010, Greenhalgh used a definition that emphasized quantitative methods: \"the use of mathematical estimates of the risk of benefit and harm, derived from high-quality research on population samples, to inform clinical decision-making in the diagnosis, investigation or management of individual patients.\" Many other definitions have been offered for individual level evidence-based medicine, but the one by Sackett and colleagues is the most commonly cited.\n\nThe two original definitions highlight important differences in how evidence-based medicine is applied to populations versus individuals. When designing guidelines applied to large groups of people in settings where there is relatively little opportunity for modification by individual physicians, evidence-based policymaking stresses that there should be good evidence to document a test´s or treatment´s effectiveness. In the setting of individual decision-making, practitioners can be given greater latitude in how they interpret research and combine it with their clinical judgment. In 2005, Eddy offered an umbrella definition for the two branches of EBM: \"Evidence-based medicine is a set of principles and methods intended to ensure that to the greatest extent possible, medical decisions, guidelines, and other types of policies are based on and consistent with good evidence of effectiveness and benefit.\"\n\nBoth branches of evidence-based medicine spread rapidly. On the evidence-based guidelines and policies side, explicit insistence on evidence of effectiveness was introduced by the American Cancer Society in 1980. The U.S. Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) began issuing guidelines for preventive interventions based on evidence-based principles in 1984. In 1985, the Blue Cross Blue Shield Association applied strict evidence-based criteria for covering new technologies. Beginning in 1987, specialty societies such as the American College of Physicians, and voluntary health organizations such as the American Heart Association, wrote many evidence-based guidelines. In 1991, Kaiser Permanente, a managed care organization in the US, began an evidence-based guidelines program. In 1991, Richard Smith wrote an editorial in the \"British Medical Journal\" and introduced the ideas of evidence-based policies in the UK. In 1993, the Cochrane Collaboration created a network of 13 countries to produce of systematic reviews and guidelines. In 1997, the US Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (then known as the Agency for Health Care Policy and Research, or AHCPR) established Evidence-based Practice Centers (EPCs) to produce evidence reports and technology assessments to support the development of guidelines. In the same year, a National Guideline Clearinghouse that followed the principles of evidence-based policies was created by AHRQ, the AMA, and the American Association of Health Plans (now America's Health Insurance Plans). In 1999, the National Institute for Clinical Excellence (NICE) was created in the UK. A central idea of this branch of evidence-based medicine is that evidence should be classified according to the rigor of its experimental design, and the strength of a recommendation should depend on the strength of the evidence.\n\nOn the medical education side, programs to teach evidence-based medicine have been created in medical schools in Canada, the US, the UK, Australia, and other countries. A 2009 study of UK programs found the more than half of UK medical schools offered some training in evidence-based medicine, although there was considerable variation in the methods and content, and EBM teaching was restricted by lack of curriculum time, trained tutors and teaching materials. Many programs have been developed to help individual physicians gain better access to evidence. For example, UpToDate was created in the early 1990s. The Cochrane Collaboration began publishing evidence reviews in 1993. BMJ Publishing Group launched a 6-monthly periodical in 1995 called Clinical Evidence that provided brief summaries of the current state of evidence about important clinical questions for clinicians. Since then many other programs have been developed to make evidence more accessible to practitioners.\n\nThe term evidence-based medicine is now applied to both the programs that are designing evidence-based guidelines and the programs that teach evidence-based medicine to practitioners. By 2000, \"evidence-based medicine\" had become an umbrella term for the emphasis on evidence in both population-level and individual-level decisions. In subsequent years, use of the term \"evidence-based\" had extended to other levels of the health care system. An example is \"evidence-based health services\", which seek to increase the competence of health service decision makers and the practice of evidence-based medicine at the organizational or institutional level. The concept has also spread outside of healthcare; for example, in his 1996 inaugural speech as President of the Royal Statistical Society, Adrian Smith proposed that \"evidence-based policy\" should be established for education, prisons and policing policy and all areas of government work.\n\nThe multiple tributaries of evidence-based medicine share an emphasis on the importance of incorporating evidence from formal research in medical policies and decisions. However they differ on the extent to which they require good evidence of effectiveness before promulgating a guideline or payment policy, and they differ on the extent to which it is feasible to incorporate individual-level information in decisions. Thus, evidence-based guidelines and policies may not readily 'hybridise' with experience-based practices orientated towards ethical clinical judgement, and can lead to contradictions, contest, and unintended crises. The most effective 'knowledge leaders' (managers and clinical leaders) use a broad range of management knowledge in their decision making, rather than just formal evidence. Evidence-based guidelines may provide the basis for governmentality in health care and consequently play a central role in the distant governance of contemporary health care systems.\n\nThe steps for designing explicit, evidence-based guidelines were described in the late 1980s: Formulate the question (population, intervention, comparison intervention, outcomes, time horizon, setting); search the literature to identify studies that inform the question; interpret each study to determine precisely what it says about the question; if several studies address the question, synthesize their results (meta-analysis); summarize the evidence in \"evidence tables\"; compare the benefits, harms and costs in a \"balance sheet\"; draw a conclusion about the preferred practice; write the guideline; write the rationale for the guideline; have others review each of the previous steps; implement the guideline.\n\nFor the purposes of medical education and individual-level decision making, five steps of EBM in practice were described in 1992 and the experience of delegates attending the 2003 Conference of Evidence-Based Health Care Teachers and Developers was summarized into five steps and published in 2005. This five step process can broadly be categorized as:\n\n\nSystematic reviews of published research studies is a major part of the evaluation of particular treatments. The Cochrane Collaboration is one of the best-known programs that conducts systematic reviews. Like other collections of systematic reviews, it requires authors to provide a detailed and repeatable plan of their literature search and evaluations of the evidence. Once all the best evidence is assessed, treatment is categorized as (1) likely to be beneficial, (2) likely to be harmful, or (3) evidence did not support either benefit or harm.\n\nA 2007 analysis of 1,016 systematic reviews from all 50 Cochrane Collaboration Review Groups found that 44% of the reviews concluded that the intervention was likely to be beneficial, 7% concluded that the intervention was likely to be harmful, and 49% concluded that evidence did not support either benefit or harm. 96% recommended further research. A 2001 review of 160 Cochrane systematic reviews (excluding complementary treatments) in the 1998 database revealed that, according to two readers, 41% concluded positive or possibly positive effect, 20% concluded evidence of no effect, 8% concluded net harmful effects, and 21% of the reviews concluded insufficient evidence. A review of 145 alternative medicine Cochrane reviews using the 2004 database revealed that 38.4% concluded positive effect or possibly positive (12.4%) effect, 4.8% concluded no effect, 0.7% concluded harmful effect, and 56.6% concluded insufficient evidence. In 2017, a study assessed the role of systematic reviews produced by Cochrane Collaboration to inform US private payers' policies making; it showed that though medical policy documents of major US private were informed by Cochrane systematic review; there was still scope to encourage the further usage.\n\nEvidence quality can be assessed based on the source type (from meta-analyses and systematic reviews of triple-blind randomized clinical trials with concealment of allocation and no attrition at the top end, down to conventional wisdom at the bottom), as well as other factors including statistical validity, clinical relevance, currency, and peer-review acceptance. Evidence-based medicine categorizes different types of clinical evidence and rates or grades them according to the strength of their freedom from the various biases that beset medical research. For example, the strongest evidence for therapeutic interventions is provided by systematic review of randomized, triple-blind, placebo-controlled trials with allocation concealment and complete follow-up involving a homogeneous patient population and medical condition. In contrast, patient testimonials, case reports, and even expert opinion (however, some critics have argued that expert opinion \"does not belong in the rankings of the quality of empirical evidence because it does not represent a form of empirical evidence\" and continue that \"expert opinion would seem to be a separate, complex type of knowledge that would not fit into hierarchies otherwise limited to empirical evidence alone\"). have little value as proof because of the placebo effect, the biases inherent in observation and reporting of cases, difficulties in ascertaining who is an expert and more.\n\nSeveral organizations have developed grading systems for assessing the quality of evidence. For example, in 1989 the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) put forth the following:\n\n\nAnother example is the Oxford (UK) CEBM Levels of Evidence. First released in September 2000, the Oxford CEBM Levels of Evidence provides 'levels' of evidence for claims about prognosis, diagnosis, treatment benefits, treatment harms, and screening, which most grading schemes do not address. The original CEBM Levels was Evidence-Based On Call to make the process of finding evidence feasible and its results explicit. In 2011, an international team redesigned the Oxford CEBM Levels to make it more understandable and to take into account recent developments in evidence ranking schemes. The Oxford CEBM Levels of Evidence have been used by patients, clinicians and also to develop clinical guidelines including recommendations for the optimal use of phototherapy and topical therapy in psoriasis and guidelines for the use of the BCLC staging system for diagnosing and monitoring hepatocellular carcinoma in Canada.\n\nIn 2000, a system was developed by the GRADE (short for Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation) working group and takes into account more dimensions than just the quality of medical research. It requires users of GRADE who are performing an assessment of the quality of evidence, usually as part of a systematic review, to consider the impact of different factors on their confidence in the results. Authors of GRADE tables grade the quality of evidence into four levels, on the basis of their confidence in the observed effect (a numerical value) being close to what the true effect is. The confidence value is based on judgements assigned in five different domains in a structured manner. The GRADE working group defines 'quality of evidence' and 'strength of recommendations' based on the quality as two different concepts which are commonly confused with each other.\n\nSystematic reviews may include randomized controlled trials that have low risk of bias, or, observational studies that have high risk of bias. In the case of randomized controlled trials, the quality of evidence is high, but can be downgraded in five different domains.\n\n\nIn the case of observational studies per GRADE, the quality of evidence starts of lower and may be upgraded in three domains in addition to being subject to downgrading.\n\n\nMeaning of the levels of quality of evidence as per GRADE:\n\nIn guidelines and other publications, recommendation for a clinical service is classified by the balance of risk versus benefit and the level of evidence on which this information is based. The U.S. Preventive Services Task Force uses:\n\n\nGRADE guideline panelists may make strong or weak recommendations on the basis of further criteria. Some of the important criteria are the balance between desirable and undesirable effects (not considering cost), the quality of the evidence, values and preferences and costs (resource utilization).\n\nDespite the differences between systems, the purposes are the same: to guide users of clinical research information on which studies are likely to be most valid. However, the individual studies still require careful critical appraisal.\n\nEvidence-based medicine attempts to express clinical benefits of tests and treatments using mathematical methods. Tools used by practitioners of evidence-based medicine include:\n\n\nEvidence-based medicine attempts to objectively evaluate the quality of clinical research by critically assessing techniques reported by researchers in their publications.\n\n\nAlthough evidence-based medicine is regarded as the gold standard of clinical practice, there are a number of limitations and criticisms of its use. Two widely cited categorization schemes for the various published critiques of EBM include the three-fold division of Straus and McAlister (\"limitations universal to the practice of medicine, limitations unique to evidence-based medicine and misperceptions of evidence-based-medicine\") and the five-point categorization of Cohen, Stavri and Hersh (EBM is a poor philosophic basis for medicine, defines evidence too narrowly, is not evidence-based, is limited in usefulness when applied to individual patients, or reduces the autonomy of the doctor/patient relationship).\n\nIn no particular order, some published objections include:\n\n\nOne of the ongoing challenges with evidence-based medicine is that some healthcare providers do not follow the evidence. This happens partly because the current balance of evidence for and against treatments shifts constantly, and it is impossible to learn about every change. Even when the evidence is unequivocally against a treatment, it usually takes ten years for other treatments to be adopted. In other cases, significant change can require a generation of physicians to retire or die, and be replaced by physicians who were trained with more recent evidence.\n\nAnother major cause of physicians and other healthcare providers treating patients in ways unsupported by the evidence is that these healthcare providers are subject to the same cognitive biases as all other humans. They may reject the evidence because they have a vivid memory of a rare but shocking outcome (the availability heuristic), such as a patient dying after refusing treatment. They may overtreat to \"do something\" or to address a patient's emotional needs. They may worry about malpractice charges based on a discrepancy between what the patient expects and what the evidence recommends. They may also overtreat or provide ineffective treatments because the treatment feels biologically plausible.\n\nThe Berlin questionnaire and the Fresno Test are validated instruments for assessing the effectiveness of education in evidence-based medicine. These questionnaires have been used in diverse settings.\n\nA Campbell systematic review that included 24 trials examined the effectiveness of e-learning in improving evidence-based health care knowledge and practice. It was found that e-learning, compared to no learning, improves evidence-based health care knowledge and skills but not attitudes and behaviour. There is no difference in outcomes when comparing e-learning to face-to-face learning. Combining e-learning with face-to-face learning (blended learning) has a positive impact on evidence-based knowledge, skills, attitude and behaviour. Related to e-learning, medical school students have engaged with editing Wikipedia to increase their EBM skills.\n\n"}

In many cases it is a highly polluting material and requires special care in its disposal. \n\nIn many fire fighting situations, large quantities of water remain after the fire has been extinguished. The water contains materials present in the building and also contains dissolved and particulate materials from combustion processes and materials generated through quenching. Fire water can be particularly polluting when the building or site being extinguished itself contains potentially polluting materials such as pesticides, organic and inorganic chemical reagents, fertilizers, etc. Certain types of premises including farms and the chemical industry pose special risks because of the types of materials present. Premises containing quantities of plastics can also cause severe problems because of the taste and odor imparted to the fire water. Releasing contaminated fire water into a river or other water source subsequently used to supply drinking water may render the untreated water supply unsuitable for drinking or food preparation.\n\nManaging fire water frequently requires that the water be contained on site and then removed from site for specialised treatment. One of the recognised techniques is to contain the fire water in the drainage system using pneumatic bladders or lockable non-return valves which can be activated either automatically or manually.\n\nFire water containment is one of the many environmental factors that is considered alongside spill and pollution containment as an essential part of any company's environmental policy for ISO14001 accreditation.\n"}

There were several schemes in the early part of the 1800s, with the Glasgow Company which was established in 1806 pumping filtered water from the River Clyde into the city. The Gorbals Gravitation Water Company was established in 1846, and brought water from reservoirs to the south-west of the city. However, an outbreak of cholera in 1848/1849, in which 4,000 people died, concentrated the minds of Glasgow Council, and in 1855 a scheme to use water from Loch Katrine, to the north, was authorised. The work required at Loch Katrine was quite modest, and the major construction work was the building of an aqueduct to carry the water to the city by gravity.\n\nThe civil engineer John Frederick Bateman managed the contract, but the engineer for final section into the city was James Morris Gale, who became the Engineer in Chief for the Glasgow Water Commissioners when the project was completed in 1859. He oversaw the development of the system, with levels in Loch Katrine being raised and a second aqueduct being constructed, until he retired in 1902. Extra water was obtained from Loch Arklet in 1914, when a dam and tunnel into Loch Katrine were completed, but a similar scheme to impound water in Glen Finglas and feed it through a tunnel to Loch Katrine was delayed by the First World War, and was not implemented until 1965. A new treatment works at Milngavie costing £120 million was completed in 2008 and opened Queen Elizabeth.\n\nGlasgow also invested in sewerage, with sewage treatment works opening at Dalmarnock in 1894, Dalmuir in 1904 and Shieldhall in 1910. They carried out research into better ways to treat sewage, and until 1935 sold sludge cakes as \"Globe Fertiliser\". Surplus sludge was carried away by a fleet of sludge ships, to be dumped at sea, and the ships also took passengers along for the voyage, initially to help recuperating soldiers, but later for the general public. A major upgrade to the sewerage infrastructure took place in 2017, when a tunnel was completed, to provide storm water storage, a project which reduces flood risk, and should ensure that the River Clyde is not polluted by sewage overflows in storm conditions.\n\nThe earliest known records of activity concerning a public water supply in Glasgow date from 1805, when the civil engineer Thomas Telford produced a report on schemes for supplying Glasgow and its suburbs with water. In 1806 he produced a second report and an Act of Parliament was obtained to create the Glasgow Company. They took advice from the Scottish inventor and mechanical engineer James Watt, and plans for a water treatment works on the north bank of the River Clyde were drawn up by Telford. The company constructed filtering beds and ponds, and bought two Boulton and Watt steam engines, but the system did not work well, and a new works was constructed on the south bank. In order to filter water from the river, they constructed a tunnel below river level, with open joints between the bricks, which allowed water to seep through the river bank, which was formed of sand, and to be drawn off from the tunnel. Although the filtering was not particularly efficient, the system lasted for 30 years, and provided per day on average, with the amount available depending on the river level.\n\nA second company was established by Act of Parliament in 1812. The civil engineer and statistician James Cleland produced a report in 1813, on a scheme for raising and distributing water, and building public baths, and there was a flurry of activity in the 1830s. James Jardine, who was engineer for much of the early work for the Edinburgh Water Company, was consulted in 1834, Thomas Grainger published a report on the Glasgow water supply in 1835, and Robert Thom, the designer of the self-cleaning sand filter used in water purification, produced another report in 1837. The Glasgow Company took over the other company in 1838, but the quality of the water they supplied was poor, and there was general dissatisfaction with their performance. This resulted in a number of alternative schemes being considered.\n\nThe first was a scheme to exploit the waters of Loch Lubnaig, in the River Callender catchment, some to the north of Glasgow. This was abandoned when it was discovered that more compensation water would be required than the loch could hold. The neighbouring Loch Katrine was also considered, but was not pursued at that time. The engineer Nathaniel Beardmore moved to London in 1843, where he collaborated with James Meadows Rendel on a project for the Glasgow Gravitation Water Company. The scheme was for a reservoir at Gilmerston, in the valley of the River Avon, and a aqueduct to transport the water to Glasgow. Some work was carried out in 1844, but the project was abandoned in early 1845.\n\nOne successful scheme was the Gorbals Gravitation Water Company, which obtained an Act of Parliament in 1846, allowing them to supply water to the population living to the south of the Clyde, obtained from a catchment of to the south-west of Glasgow. The engineer for the scheme was William Gale, who supervised the construction of the works and two earth dams to impound the water, at Waulkmill Glen and Ryat Linn. The initial phase was completed in 1848, and a second phase, which included the construction of a third reservoir at Balgray, was finished in 1854. The reservoir outlets were arranged so that water could be drawn off at several different levels, and the scheme produced about per day, of which were required for compensation water, to maintain flows in the river system, and the rest was available to the people of Glasgow. Some 75,000 benefitted from a constant supply of good quality filtered water, as Gale strongly advocated that water should be available all the time.\n\nResidents in other parts of the city were not so fortunate, as the insanitary conditions led to an outbreak of cholera in 1848/1849, in which around 4,000 people died. In 1852 there was an attempt to revive the Loch Lubnaig scheme, but this was opposed in Parliament by Glasgow Council, and in this they were assisted by the civil engineer John Frederick Bateman. Having defeated the bill, they asked Bateman for advice on a suitable water supply, and he favoured the Loch Katrine scheme. The council then sought advice from other engineers on that and other schemes, but both Stephenson and Brunel supported Bateman's proposal. The council therefore sought authorisation for it, and an Act of Parliament was obtained on 12 July 1855.\n\nCompared to the massive earth dams that were being built to supply Edinburgh with water at a similar time, the reservoir works for the Loch Katrine scheme were rather modest. Water was stored in the loch by allowing the water levels to vary between above the normal level and below it. The Act allowed per day to be taken into the water supply, but in order to maintain flows on the river system below it, the outlet of Loch Venachar was also modified, so that it could be controlled to supply of compensation water per day. The water level of Loch Katrine is above sea level, and water for Glasgow is conveyed by gravity along an aqueduct to a reservoir at Mugdock, some from the city centre. The aqueduct is long, of which is tunnel, consists of an open channel or bridges, and the rest is made from pipelines. The tunnelled sections and cuts were designed to carry the maximum allowed by the Act, but the pipelines were only sized to allow half of that volume initially. The service reservoir at Mugdock held , and from there it was conveyed into the city through twin pipes. The scheme was completed in 1859 and was formally opened by Queen Victoria, having cost £918,000.\n\nThe aqueduct includes 70 tunnels, with one just south of Loch Katrine being long and below the land surface at its deepest point. Twelve access shafts were constructed to allow work to proceed at multiple faces. 25 bridges were needed to carry the aqueduct pipes over depressions. That across the Duchray valley is long, and its masonry piers are up to high. It originally carried a single pipe, but a second was added above the first in the 1860s. A third pipe was added in 1881, carried by a steel trussed girder bridge on sandstone piers. The longest bridge is at Corrie, and is long. Castle Burn is crossed by a bridge long, and there are three bridges at Couligarten, with lengths of , and . The masonry was built of dry stone, but mortar was added in the 1860s.\n\nWhile Bateman had managed the main pipeline, James Morris Gale became the resident engineer for the city section of the project. After it all opened in 1859, he became Engineer in Chief for the Glasgow Water Commissioners, a post he held for over 40 years until he retired in 1902. By 1882, the supply from Loch Katrine was no longer sufficient, and he suggested a scheme to double the pipeline, raise the levels in Loch Katrine a little more, and to obtain further sources from other lochs in the vicinity of Loch Katrine. Acts of Parliament were obtained in 1883 and 1885, which allowed the level of Loch Katrine to be raised by . This required the construction of a new dam, which was located just downstream of the first dam, and had nine sluices to control compensation water, rather than the four of the original dam. This work was carried out using direct labour between 1886 and 1896, and an official opening took place on 21 June 1901. Gale chose a more direct route for the new aqueduct, which involved more tunnelling, but by this time pneumatic drills and better explosives were available, and he felt that the long bridges such as that at Duchray were the least satisfactory element of the original design. Friction in the tunnels of the first route had reduced the throughput below what had been expected, and the new tunnels were lines with concrete to improve flows. The revised route for the second aqueduct was shorter, and the possible throughput with both aqueducts in use increased to per day.\n\nAt Milngavie, Mugdock Reservoir was built as a holding reservoir for water arriving from Loch Katrine. A number of buildings with rubble walls and slate roofs dating from this first phase survive. In the 1890s when the pipeline was doubled, Craigmaddie reservoir was built to act as a second holding reservoir. Work started on 1 May 1896 and it was completed on 11 June 1896, but there were problems with leakage, and a deep trench was cut to resolve the issue, so it was not operational until 1 January 1897. A causeway and dam, which is faced with rubble, separates the two reservoirs. Both reservoirs have a draw-off tower and straining well, to remove debris from the water supply. The straining wells were decommissioned in 2007 as part of the construction of a new treatment works.\n\nA further Act was obtained in 1902, which authorised the construction of a dam at the western end of Loch Arklet to impound the water, and a tunnel through a ridge of hills at the eastern end, allowing the water to flow into Loch Katrine. Work on this scheme began in 1909, and was completed in 1914. Construction of a dam across the River Turk to impound water in Glen Finglas and excavation of a connecting tunnel to Loch Katrine was authorised by an Act of 1903, but little work was done due to the start of the First World War. By the time hostilities ceased, construction costs had risen significantly, and the project was deferred, with the tunnel finally being completed in 1958 and the dam in 1965. As the Glen Finglas scheme did not proceed at that time, the level of Loch Katrine was raised by another between 1919 and 1929, by raising the height of the dam. The extra height meant that the dam also had to be lengthened, and it was extended to . When the work was completed, it allowed the top of the loch to be used for water supply, representing a reserve of nine months.\n\nRestructuring of the water industry has followed a different path in Scotland to that of England and Wales. The Water (Scotland) Act 1967 was an attempt to consolidate the large number of water supply authorities, and created 13 regional water boards. Responsibility for Glasgow's water supply passed to the Lower Clyde Water Board, along with eleven other suppliers. Under the Local Government (Scotland) Act 1973, the functions of the water boards were taken over by regional councils, who were also given responsibility for sewerage and sewage treatment. Control of these functions works passed to Strathclyde Regional Council. It subsequently passed to the West of Scotland Water Authority in 1996, and in 2002 was transferred to the newly-formed Scottish Water.\n\nAs regulations for water quality have become more stringent, there has been a need for more water treatment before water enters the domestic supply system. For the Loch Katrine water supply, this is handled by a works at Balmore and a new treatment works at Milngavie, which is partly underground, cost £120 million and was completed in 2008. The need for a new works was highlighted in August 2002, when following the 2002 Glasgow floods, the waterborne parasite cryptosporidium was found in the Mugdock reservoir, and 140,000 people had to boil their water before drinking it, until the problem could be eradicated. The construction project for the works was managed by Black & Veatch, and the impact on the landscape was reduced by constructing part of the works below ground, and using lamella clarifiers, which take up less room than sludge cone settlement tanks. The works was formally opened by Queen Elizabeth and won the 2007 Utility Industry Achievement Award, having been completed ahead of its time schedule and for £10 million below its budgeted cost.\n\nSince the publication of Edwin Chadwick's \"Report on the Sanitary Condition of the Labouring Population of Great Britain\" in 1842, there had been a growing understanding that the health of people in cities depended both on a clean water supply and an efficient method of disposal and treatment of sewage, to prevent the occurrence of waterborne diseases such as cholera. Despite such knowledge, little was done to provide sewers until there was a general outcry about the state of the River Clyde and other watercourses. When the Caledonian Railway wanted to construct tunnels below Glasgow's streets, a condition of their authorisation was that they had to reconstruct the sewers, such as they were, and on this they spent £200,000. The sewers became part of Glasgow Corporation's main drainage scheme, which served an area of . Glasgow was effectively divided into three, with each sector having its own sewage treatment works. Dalmarnock Works was the first to open in 1894, to be followed by Dalmuir in 1904 and Shieldhall in 1910.\n\nDalmarnock Sewage Treatment Works was the first large-scale installation of its type in Scotland. Gustav Valentine Alsing, who was Danish and an acknowledged expert on chemical precipitation, designed the works. Construction began in 1893 and it was completed the following year. Sewage flowed into the works through three channels, were floating material was screened off and incinerated. Grit, sand and other heavy solids settled out in catch pits, and was transported away from the site by railway, as the Caledonian Railway had a siding into the works. The liquor passed into 24 settling tanks, each able to hold , was aerated, and then entered 60 coke filters, which covered an area of . Sand filters provided the final stage of treatment, before the liquid was discharged into the Clyde. The coke filters were not particularly successful, and were abandoned in favour of precipitation. Sludge from this process was mixed with lime and the water content removed in filter presses, to form sludge cakes, which were also removed from the site by rail. A Cunmor drying plant was then installed, and the sludge cakes were marketed as \"Globe Fertiliser\", with sales reaching 32,000 tons per year by 1911. However, the works produced a greater volume than this, and the surplus was taken by boat to be dumped at sea near Garrock Head on the Isle of Bute. Production of \"Globe Fertiliser\" lasted until 1935.\n\nThe works experimented with bacterial treatment in 1900, and eight bacterial beds were constructed. Filter beds covering followed in 1913, as a test bed for biological filtration. In 1914, a pumping main was constructed to carry untreated sludge from the works to the Shieldhall works, from where sludge boats took it to be dumped at sea. The pipeline was long and in diameter. Ardern and Lockett had discovered the Activated Sludge Process while carrying out research at the Davyhulme Sewage Works in Manchester in 1914, and when the works was in need of improvement in the 1930s, a Simplex Activated Sludge Plant was built to try out the new process. A full activated sludge plant was built between 1962 and 1968 by the consulting engineers Babtie, Shaw & Morton, at a cost of £4 million.\n\nThe sewerage infrastructure was improved significantly in 2017, with the completion of a tunnel long, which provides of storm water storage. It will reduce the risk of flooding and the likelihood that sewage will overflow into the Clyde during storms. The tunnel runs between Craigton and Queen's Park in south Glasgow, is in diameter, and was constructed by a consortium of Costain and Vinci Construction Grand Projets.\n\nOnce sewage had been processed, much of the sludge was taken by ship to be dumped at sea. Glasgow Corporation owned six ships at various times, and borrowed a seventh briefly. \"Dalmuir\" was ordered for the opening of Dalmuir Works, and \"Shieldhall\" was ordered for the opening of Shieldhall Works. \"Dalmuir\" was replaced by \"Dalmarnock\", and the two ships shared the sludge workings. \"Shieldhall\" was loaned to Manchester Corporation between 1941 and 1947, as their vessel which carried sludge from Davyhulme Sewage Works had been destroyed by a mine. \"Dalmarnock\" was able to maintain the service from Glasgow, as the sludge was dumped near Loch Long, rather than near the Isle of Bute, due to the presence of a defence boom across the Firth of Clyde near Dunoon. Dumping of sludge at sea was discontinued in 1998, following the implementation of the EU Urban Waste Water Treatment Directive.\n\nMost of the ships also carried passengers on the sludge runs, a tradition the probably began during the First World War, as a way to help convalescing soldiers, although there are suggestions that some poor and elderly passengers may have been carried before that war. Subsequently, the ships carried organised groups of passengers during the summer months. After it had spent a few years working out of Southampton for the Southern Water Authority, the second \"Shieldhall\" was bought by the Solent Steam Packet Co in 1988 for preservation, and offers trips from Southampton.\n\n"}

The intended information transmission technology might use a messaging, document exchange, or services approach.\n\nSAIF is the framework that is required to rationalize interoperability of standards. SAIF is an \"architecture\" for achieving interoperability, but it is not a whole-solution design for enterprise architecture management.\n\nThe informative document may be found at Public SAIF CD. Since the release of this document, the SAIF-CD has been balloted as a Draft Standard for Trial Use. The document will be made available by the end of May, 2012.\n\nA Short introduction to SAIF was made to provide insight to users of the SAIF-CD.\n\nThe SAIF-CD consists of the following sections:\nThe SAIF Introduction and Overview describes the general constructs that frame the SAIF. SAIF represents a synthesis of best practices and concepts from multiple architectural frameworks. This introduction to SAIF goes into a lot of technical depth and assumes you are already familiar with architectural standards and the HL7 organization.\n\nThe Governance Framework (GF) describes the motivation for, the structure, content and utilization of the GF. The ECCF and BF are discussed in detail in separate documents, and are mentioned in the course of this document only when necessary to either contextualize or logically link GF content to the larger context of the Services Aware Interoperability Framework.\n\nThe Behavioral Framework (BF) provides a set of constructs for defining the behavioral semantics of specifications, which enable working interoperability. As a result, the focus of the BF is accountability – a description of “who does what when.” Accountability describes the perspective of the various technology components that are involved in a particular instance or scenario designed to achieve Working Interoperability. The BF is technology-neutral and, therefore, can be used within model-driven specification stacks.\n\nThe Information Framework (IF) is a SAIF-compliant recasting of existing HL7 expertise regarding the specification of static semantics.\nThe Information Framework will draw on the information available from the following sources:\n\nThe major goal of the Enterprise Consistency and Conformity Framework (ECCF) is enabling working interoperability between different users, organizations, and systems. The ECCF is manifest in a structure called the ECCF specification stack (SS). This structure identifies, defines, organizes, and relates a set of artifacts that collectively specify the relevant semantics of a software component specification or other system-of- interest. In summary, the ECCF SS provides an organizational framework in which inter-related artifacts are sorted by content – for example a Unified Modeling Language (UML) activity diagram in the Business viewpoint that contains static data constructs (for example, documents or data structures) which passes between the various structures would all have the relevant static constructs detailed in artifacts, specifically, business rules, information constructors, behavioral contracts, and level-of-abstraction. \n\nThe Interoperability Specification Matrix (ISM) defines a 5-column-by-3-row matrix (“table”) which distributes the multiple aspects of a given component’s specification across the various cells of the matrix. The structure of the ISM is based on proven cognitive models for describing complex systems which revolve around the notion of partitioning complexity based on a number of Dimensions while simultaneously viewing each of these dimensions from multiple Perspectives.\n\nThis section defines the creation of a compliant implementation guide.\n"}

{"id": "714259", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=714259", "title": "Intraocular lens", "text": "Intraocular lens\n\nIntraocular lens (IOL) is a lens implanted in the eye as part of a treatment for cataracts or myopia. The most common type of IOL is the pseudophakic IOL. These are implanted during cataract surgery, after the cloudy eye's natural lens (colloquially called a cataract) has been removed. The pseudophakic IOL provides the same light focusing function as the natural crystalline lens. The second type of IOL, more commonly known as a phakic intraocular lens (PIOL), is a lens which is placed over the existing natural lens and is used in refractive surgery to change the eye's optical power as a treatment for myopia (nearsightedness).\n\nIOLs usually consist of a small plastic lens with plastic side struts, called haptics, to hold the lens in place in the capsular bag inside the eye. IOLs were conventionally made of an inflexible material (PMMA), although this has largely been superseded by the use of flexible materials. Most IOLs fitted today are fixed monofocal lenses matched to distance vision. However, other types are available, such as multifocal IOLs that provide the patient with multiple-focused vision at far and reading distance, and adaptive IOLs that provide the patient with limited visual accommodation.\n\nSurgeons annually implant more than 6 million lenses. The procedure can be done under local anesthesia with the patient awake throughout the operation. The use of a flexible IOL enables the lens to be rolled for insertion into the capsule through a very small incision, thus avoiding the need for stitches. This procedure usually takes less than 30 minutes in the hands of an experienced ophthalmologist. The recovery period is about 2–3 weeks. After surgery, patients should avoid strenuous exercise or anything else that significantly increases blood pressure. They should visit their ophthalmologists regularly for several months to monitor the implants.\n\nIOL implantation carries several risks associated with eye surgeries, such as infection, loosening of the lens, lens rotation, inflammation and nighttime halos, but a systematic review of studies has determined that the procedure is safer than conventional laser eye treatment. Though IOLs enable many patients to have reduced dependence on glasses, most patients still rely on glasses for certain activities, such as reading.\n\nIntraocular lenses have been used since 1999 for correcting larger errors in near-sighted, far-sighted, and astigmatic eyes. This type of IOL is also called phakic intraocular lens (PIOL), and the crystalline lens is not removed.\n\nPhakic IOL appear to be less dangerous than excimer laser surgery in those with significant nearsightedness.\n\nMore commonly, aphakic IOLs (that is, not PIOLs) are implanted via clear lens extraction and replacement (CLEAR) surgery. During CLEAR, the crystalline lens is extracted and an IOL replaces it in a process that is very similar to cataract surgery: both involve lens replacement, local anesthesia, last approximately 30 minutes, and require making a small incision in the eye for lens insertion. People recover from CLEAR surgery 1–7 days after the operation. During this time, they should avoid strenuous exercise or anything else that significantly raises blood pressure. They should visit their ophthalmologists regularly for several months to monitor the IOL implants.\n\nCLEAR has a 90% success rate (risks include wound leakage, infection, inflammation, and astigmatism). CLEAR can be performed only on patients ages 40 and older. This is to ensure that eye growth, which disrupts IOL lenses, will not occur post-surgery.\n\nOnce implanted, IOL lenses have three major benefits. First, they are an alternative to LASIK, a form of eye surgery that does not work for people with serious vision problems. Effective IOL implants also entirely eliminate the need for glasses or contact lenses post-surgery for most patients. The cataract will not return, as the lens has been removed. The disadvantage is that the eye's ability to change focus (accommodate) has generally been reduced or eliminated, depending on the kind of lens implanted.\n\nSome of the risks that FDA have been found so far during a three-year study of the Artisan are:\n\nOther risks include:\n\nOne of the causes of the risks above is that the lens can rotate inside the eye if the PIOL is too short, if the eye was incorrectly measured, or because the sulcus has a slightly oval shape (the height is slightly smaller than the width). Toric IOLs must be powered and aligned inside the eye on a meridian that corrects the patient's preexisting astigmatism. Again, these lenses can rotate inside the eye postoperatively or be placed incorrectly by the operating surgeon. Either way, the patient's preexisting astigmatism may not be corrected completely or may even increase.\n\nWhen IOLs are implanted in the aphakic patient—either after clear lensectomy for the correction of refractive error or after cataract extraction to restore eyesight—astigmatism in these patients is mainly attributable to the cornea. The surgeon can ascertain the astigmatic, or steepest, meridian in a number of ways, including manifest refraction or corneal topography. Manifest refraction is the familiar test where the eye doctor rotates lenses in front of the eye, asking the patient, \"Which is better (or clearer), this one or this one?\" Corneal topography is considered a more quantitative test, and for purposes of aligning a toric IOL, most surgeons use a measurement called simulated keratometry (SimK), which is calculated by the internal programming of the corneal topography machine, to determine the astigmatic meridian on the surface of the cornea. The astigmatic meridian can also be identified using corneal wavefront technology or paraxial curvature matching.\n\nOne of the major disadvantages of conventional IOLs is that they are primarily focused for distance vision. Though patients who undergo a standard IOL implantation no longer experience clouding from cataracts, they are unable to accommodate, or change focus from near to far, far to near, and to distances in between. Accommodating IOLs interact with ciliary muscles and zonules, using hinges at both ends to “latch on” and move forward and backward inside the eye using the same mechanism as normal accommodation. These IOLs have a 4.5-mm square-edged optic and a long hinged plate design with polyimide loops at the end of the haptics. The hinges are made of an advanced silicone called BioSil that was thoroughly tested to make sure it was capable of unlimited flexing in the eye.\n\nThe materials that have been used to manufacture intraocular lens implants include polymethylmethacrylate (PMMA), silicone, hydrophobic acrylate, hydrophilic acrylate and collamer. Polymethylmethacrylate (PMMA) was the first material to be used successfully in intraocular lenses. British ophthalmologist Sir Harold Ridley observed that Royal Air Force pilots who sustained eye injuries during World War II involving PMMA windshield material did not show any rejection or foreign body reaction. Deducing that the transparent material was inert and useful for implantation in the eye, Ridley designed and implanted the first intraocular lens in a human eye.\n\nAdvances in technology have brought about the use of silicone and acrylic, both of which are soft foldable inert materials. This allows the lens to be folded and inserted into the eye through a smaller incision. Specifically, acrylic lenses are a better choice in people who have a history of uveitis or are likely to have to undergo retinal surgery requiring vitrectomy with replacement by silicone oil, such as persons with proliferative diabetic retinopathy or who are at high risk of retinal detachment, such as persons with high myopia. A study found that in participants with a history of uveitis, eyes treated with hydrophobic acrylic IOLs were over 2 times more likely to have a best corrected visual acuity of 20/40 or more, compared to eyes treated with silicone IOLs.\n\nThe trademarked \"Natural Yellow\" material is available in three hydrophilic IOLs. Dr. Patrick H. Benz of Benz Research and Development created the first IOL material to incorporate the same UV-A blocking and violet light filtering chromophore that's present in the human crystalline lens. This breakthrough material provides the exact chromophore the human retina naturally has for light protection.\n\nOther IOLs include:\n\n\nThe root of these words comes from the Greek word \"phakos\" 'lens'.\n\nPhakic IOLs are implanted without removal of the patient's original crystalline lens, and this is performed solely to correct refractive error in the presence of a clear crystalline lens.\n\nAphakic IOLs generally refer to lenses implanted secondarily in an eye already aphakic from previous surgery or trauma some time ago.\n\nPseudophakic IOLs refer to lenses implanted during cataract surgery, as a sequential step after removal of the cataractous lens of the person.\n\nMany aphakic and pseudophakic IOLs such as anterior chamber IOLs or 3 piece posterior chamber IOLs can be used interchangeably. The exception are one piece IOLs, which must be placed within the capsular bag at the time of cataract surgery and hence cannot be used as secondary implants.\n\nAs with IOLs inserted after cataract extraction, phakic IOLs (PIOLs) can be spheric or toric. The difference is that they are placed in an eye that retains the natural human crystalline lens. As with aphakic eyes, toric PIOLs have to be aligned with the meridian of astigmatism; toric IOL misalignment or rotation can lead to residual or even greater astigmatism postoperatively.\n\nDepending on their placement site in the eye, PIOLs can be divided into:\n\nA toric IOL is a type of toric lens used to correct preexisting corneal astigmatism at the time of cataract surgery. This astigmatism can also be treated with limbal relaxing incisions or an excimer laser procedure. About 40% of Americans have significant astigmatism and thus may be candidates for a toric IOL.\nCataract surgery with implantation of a toric IOL is essentially the same as cataract surgery with a conventional IOL. Like toric contact lenses, toric IOLs have different powers in different meridians of the lens, and they must be positioned on the correct meridian to reverse the preexisting astigmatism. If the toric IOL is not on the correct meridian, it may need to be repositioned in a second procedure.\n\nIn the United States, a new category of intraocular lenses was opened with the approval by the Food and Drug Administration in 2003 of multifocal and accommodating lenses. These come at an additional cost to the recipient beyond what Medicare will pay and each has advantages and disadvantages.\n\nMultifocal IOLs provide for simultaneous viewing of distance vision and near vision. Trifocal IOLs can provide intermediate vision. The most common adverse visual effects from multifocal IOLs include glare, halos, and a loss of contrast sensitivity, in low light conditions.\n\nMonofocal lenses are standard lenses used in cataract surgery. People who have a multifocal intraocular lens after their cataract is removed may be less likely to need additional glasses compared with people who have standard monofocal lenses. However, people receiving multifocal lenses may experience more visual problems, such as glare or haloes (rings around lights), than with monofocal lenses.\n\nPeople receiving accommodative intraocular lenses had improvements in near vision but these improvements were small and reduced over time. People who received accommodative intraocular lenses may have a higher risk of thickening and clouding of the tissue behind the intraocular lenses (posterior capsule opacification) but there is some uncertainty around this finding.\n\nSir Harold Ridley was the first to successfully implant an intraocular lens on 29 November 1949, at St Thomas' Hospital at London. That lens was manufactured by the Rayner company of Brighton, East Sussex, England from Perspex CQ polymethylmethacrylate (PMMA) made by ICI (Imperial Chemical Industries). It is said the idea of implanting an intraocular lens came to him after an intern asked him why he was not replacing the lens he had removed during cataract surgery. The acrylic plastic material was chosen because Ridley noticed it was inert after seeing RAF (Royal Air Force) pilots of World War II with pieces of shattered canopies in their eyes (this acrylic resin is known by several trade names including Lucite and Plexiglas).\n\nThe intraocular lens did not find widespread acceptance in cataract surgery until the 1970s, when further developments in lens design and surgical techniques had come about.\n\nAs of the early 2000s, more than a million IOLs were implanted annually in the United States. That number was estimated by the World Health Organization to have increased to 20 million annually worldwide by 2010 (for cataract surgery), and has projected increased IOL surgeries to reach 32 million worldwide by 2020.\n\n"}

They process these donated materials and make them available to under-served hospitals and clinics in two ways: direct shipments to international applicant institutions and supplying medical mission teams with commonly needed medical items.\n\nMedShare is one of the leading medical supply recovery organizations in the United States with two distribution centers. Its national headquarters and Southeastern distribution center is in Decatur, Georgia, and its Western Region distribution center is in San Leandro, California. In 14 years of service, they have shipped over 750 forty-foot shipping containers of medical supplies and equipment valued at more than $100 million to needy health facilities in 88 countries around the world.\n\nMedShare was founded in 1998 by A.B. Short, a nonprofit entrepreneur, and Bob Freeman, a retired businessman, after learning of the environmental threat imposed by hospitals and medical companies discarding thousands of tons of medical supplies and equipment, while underserved hospitals in developing countries were desperate for the most basic medical items.\n\nShort and Freeman spent some time meeting with hospitals and medical professionals to find out if there was indeed a need for medical surplus supplies to be diverted from landfills. During these meetings, not one hospital turned their medical surplus collection program down. While performing their due diligence, they also learned of the importance of shipping medical supplies that the recipient needs, not simply shipping what they had, which led MedShare to employ a technology-based inventory system, where the qualified health recipient can custom-order the medical items for their shipment.\n\n\nMedShare uses a variety of services to get recovered surplus medical supplies and equipment from U.S. hospitals and medical companies and to qualified health recipients abroad.\n\n1) Medical Product Donations – MedShare collects hundreds of thousands of pounds of surplus medical supplies from both hospitals and medical companies. They collect a weekly average of over 20,000 pounds of surplus medical supplies and equipment from both hospitals and medical companies. MedShare only accepts unused medical supplies that have an expiration date of at least 12–18 months or more. Biomedical equipment donations must be in working condition with the all the necessary accessories and operational manual included. MedShare's biomedical engineers evaluate biomedical equipment donations to ensure they are in operable condition before they are sent to a health recipient abroad.\n\n\n2. Volunteers – MedShare offers hands-on volunteer opportunities for people to help in getting vital medical supplies to needy health recipients abroad. Each month, more than 1,500 volunteers serve at both the Southeastern and Western Distribution Centers to help sort and pack recovered surplus medical supplies. There are different sorting levels where volunteers start with assorted donated medical supplies, and eventually sort them into boxes of individual medical items, such as a box of sutures and a box of surgical gloves and a box of surgical drapes.\n\n3. Medical Product Shipments The main way MedShare distributes donated surplus medical supplies and equipment around the world is through customized 40-foot shipping containers. They work with foreign governments, corporations, nonprofit organizations and individuals who wish to sponsor shipments of medical aid to specified recipient hospitals and clinics abroad. Each sponsor must fill out an application detailing the needs of the recipient hospital and provide the necessary funding for the shipment.\n\n4. MedShare Online Inventory MedShare prides itself on its innovative use of technology to best use its resources and serve health recipients abroad. Approved health recipients are able to custom-order the supplies needed for their facilities using an online inventory. Once recovered surplus supplies have been sorted and packed by volunteers, they are entered into an online inventory database by MedShare staff. The online inventory is refreshed every hour to reflect the most up-to-date items available for recipients to order. Once a recipient's application is approved and funding in place, he/she is provided a personalized login to order the medical supplies for their 40-foot shipping container. Because of limited availability of biomedical equipment, only medical supplies are listed on the online inventory. The health recipient must submit a written request to MedShare of any biomedical equipment needs.\n\n5. Medical Mission Teams MedShare also provides medical supplies to medical professionals traveling abroad on short term trips to provide medical treatment for those in need. Medical teams must fill out an application detailing the nature of their medical trip and supply needs. Once their application is approved, they can either set up an appointment to collect supplies at the MedTeam Store at either of our distribution centers in Decatur, GA or San Leandro, California. MedShare asks for a $75 donation to collect up to 50 pounds of medical supplies from our MedTeam Store. Teams needing more than 100 pounds of medical supplies can order from MedShare's online inventory. If a medical mission team is unable to pick up the supplies at one of the distribution centers, the team can pay for MedShare to ship them the supplies they need.\n\nMedShare is 100% reliant on philanthropic support from more than 4,000 corporations, foundations, and individuals to fund its operations and receives no government funding. \n\nMedShare is governed by a board of 19 diverse and distinguished corporate, community and healthcare industry leaders. 100% of board members participate in annual and capital fund-raising campaigns at a personally sacrificial level. Throughout its 14-year history, MedShare has been spending on average less than four percent of total revenues on administration and fund-raising expenses.\n\nMedShare is a U.S. nonprofit organization with an international mission that is overseen by a Board of Trustees that serves as MedShare's governing body, responsible for the fiduciary, strategic and generative oversight and direction of the organization. Board members support 100% of the organization's annual and capital fundraising campaigns. Members serve without compensation, and meet once a quarter. The current Chairman of the Board of Trustees is James E. Arnett.\n\nMedShare's national staff consists of 37 people, with 5 executive officers.\nMedShare is a four-star ranked charity by Charity Navigator. They have also been ranked by Charity Navigator's periodic Top Ten lists as #2 out of 53 international charities providing humanitarian aid, #2 on the list of \"Slam Dunk Charities\" for fiscal responsibility, and listed on Charity Navigator's list of recommended nonprofits providing disaster relief to Haiti. MedShare is ranked as one of the \"Best in America\" charities by Independent Charities of America. In 2008, they received the Technology Innovation Award from TechBridge for the best use of technology for mission delivery by a nonprofit for our inventory system that enables beneficiaries to select exactly what they need. They were also awarded the 2008 Revolutions Award from the Georgia Center for Nonprofits recognizing the Nonprofit of the Year. In 2010, the \"Atlanta Business Chronicle\" named them the Green Giving Champion at the Environmental Business Awards. In 2010, MedShare's Western Region earned their Green Business Certification from Bay Area Green Business Program and was the Bay Area Excellence in Volunteer Management Award Winner. They've also been named a 2010 and 2011 Waste Reduction Awards, Program (WRAP) winner by the State of California's Department of Resources Recycling and Recovery CalRecycle. The Southeastern Region recently received Grants to Green funding to support our ongoing energy conservation efforts.\n\n"}

It must be removed to be cured.Definitions: A rare, biphasic, neuroblastic, and pigmented epithelial neoplasm of craniofacial sites, usually involving the oral cavity or gums.\n\nMost patients present with a very rapidly growing mass that often gives a bluish appearance in the mouth. This is because the pigmentation in the cells appears blue through the overlying epithelium (mucosa). By imaging studies, there is usually a large expansive radiolucent (clear) mass without well defined borders. Calcifications within the mass may be seen. More than 70% involve the maxilla (usually maxillary anterior alveolar ridge), while the mandible and skull are affected less often. There is often an elevated vanilmandelic acid level.\n\nIt is considered to be a developmental anomaly, and thus is congenital in presentation. It is thought to be derived from neural crest, which is one of the embryologic tissue types. The reason for this postulation is based on the expression of melanotransferrin (melanoma-specific peptide that may play role in iron metabolism).\n\nUsually there is a smooth, firm mass, with mottled white-gray to blue-black cut surfaces. The overall size ranges from 1–10 cm with a mean size 3.5 cm.\n\nThe tumor is usually very well circumscribed but not encapsulated. There are two cell types present (biphasic), arranged in alveolar or tubular configurations. There are centrally located, small, darkly staining cells comprising the majority of cells. These cells have a fibrillary cytoplasm surrounding round nuclei with coarse and heavy nuclear chromatin. These cells are surrounded by much larger polygonal cells that have open nuclear chromatin and abundant opaque cytoplasm that has granular melanin pigment. There is usually no hemorrhage, necrosis or increased mitoses.\n\nThe lesional cells will show cross reactivity with several different families of immunohistochemistry markers (polyphenotype), including neural, melanocytic, and epithelial.\n\nIt is important in this age group to exclude other tumors that can have a similar appearance, such as rhabdomyosarcoma, lymphoma, Ewing sarcoma (primitive neuroectodermal tumor), or even a melanoma (although they are very very rare in infants).\n\nEven though there is often a very dramatic and rapidly enlarging, destructive tumor, there is usually a benign clinical course after complete local excision (usually by partial maxillectomy) with clear or free surgical margins. In rare cases, chemotherapy may be used for recurrent or residual tumors. Overall, the outcome is good, although it is quite unpredictable, with about 30% of patients have a recurrence. In about 10% of cases, metastasis may be seen (lymph nodes, liver, bone and soft tissue).\nThis tumor is exception, with fewer than 500 cases reported world wide. More than 95% of patients are less than 1 year of age at presentation, with about 80% less than 6 months. Females are affected more often than males (2:1).\n"}

While most cases of mycetoma occur in Sudan, Venezuela, Mexico, and India, its true prevalence and indicence are not well-known. It appears most frequently in people living in rural areas, particularly farmers and shepherds. It is listed by the World Health Organization (WHO) as a neglected tropical disease.\nFrequent exposure to penetrating wounds by thorns or splinters is a risk factor. This risk can be reduced by disinfecting wounds and wearing shoes.\n\nMycetoma is caused by common saprotrophs found in the soil and on thorny shrubs in semi-desert climates. The most common causative agents are:\n\n\nInfection is caused as a result of localized skin trauma, such as stepping on a needle or wood splinter, or through a pre-existing wound.\n\nThe first visible symptom of mycetoma is a typically painless swelling beneath the skin; over several years, this will grow to a nodule (lump). Affected people will experience massive swelling and hardening of the area, in addition to skin rupture and the formation of sinus tracts that discharge pus and grains filled with organisms. In many instances, the underlying bone is affected. Some people with mycetoma will not experience pain or discomfort, while others will report itching and/or pain.\n\nThere are currently no rapid diagnostic tools for mycetoma. Mycetoma is diagnosed through microscopic examination of the grains in the nodule and by analysis of cultures. Since the bacterial form and the fungal form of mycetoma share similar features, diagnosis can be a challenge.\n\nWhile treatment will vary depending on the cause of the condition, it may include antibiotics or antifungal medication. Actinomycetoma, the bacterial form, can be cured with antibiotics. Eumycetoma, the fungal form, is treated with antifungals and surgery. For both forms, extended treatment is necessary.\n\nIn cats, mycetoma can be treated with complete surgical removal. Antifungal drugs are rarely effective.\n\nFor a list of trials that are related to mycetoma, go to this ClinicalTrials.gov link: https://www.clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/results?cond=%22Mycetoma%22\n\n"}

It is manufactured by the South African company Roundabout Outdoor. It operates in a similar way to a windmill-driven water pump.\n\nThe PlayPump received heavy publicity and funding when first introduced, but has since been criticized for being too expensive, too complex to maintain or repair in low-resource settings, too reliant on child labor, and overall less effective than traditional handpumps. WaterAid, one of the biggest water charities in the world, opposes the PlayPump for these reasons.\n\nThe PlayPump water system is a playground merry-go-round attached to a water pump. The spinning motion pumps underground water into a 2,500-liter tank raised seven meters above ground. The water in the tank is easily dispensed by a tap valve. According to the manufacturer the pump can raise up to 1400 liters of water per hour from a depth of 40 meters. Excess water is diverted below ground again.\n\nThe storage tank has a four-sided advertising panel. Two sides are used to advertise products, thereby providing money for maintenance of the pump, and the other two sides are devoted to public health messages about topics like HIV/AIDS prevention.\n\nThe PlayPump was invented in South Africa by Ronnie Stuiver, a borehole driller and engineer, who exhibited it at an agricultural fair in 1989. Trevor Field, an agricultural executive, saw the device at the fair and licensed it from Stuiver. Field installed the first two systems in KwaZulu-Natal province in South Africa in 1994, and began receiving media attention in 1999, when Nelson Mandela attended the opening of a school which had a PlayPump. In 2000, PlayPump received the World Bank Development Marketplace Award, and it became internationally prominent following a 2005 PBS \"Frontline\" report in 2005. At a 2006 Clinton Global Initiative ceremony, donors pledged $16.4 million to install more PlayPumps.\n\nBy 2008, 1,000 PlayPumps had been installed, and Field set a goal of installing 4,000 by 2010. However, in 2009 PlayPumps International turned its inventory of uninstalled PlayPumps over to Water For People, and stopped installing new PlayPumps in order to focus on maintenance of existing ones.\n\n\"The Guardian\" calculated in 2009 that children would have to \"play\" for 27 hours every day to meet PlayPumps' stated targets of providing 2,500 people per pump with their daily water needs.\n\nIn June 2010, PBS's \"Frontline/World\" aired an update about the failure of PlayPumps, particularly in Mozambique. Many older women, who were not consulted prior to the installation of the PlayPumps, found operating them to be difficult, especially when there were few children around. PlayPumps were also breaking down, with no way for villagers to make the expensive necessary repairs. A comprehensive report about these failures was released by UNICEF in 2007.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "6297778", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=6297778", "title": "Russell Howarth", "text": "Russell Howarth\n\nRussell Michael Howarth (born 27 March 1982) is an English former professional footballer who played as a goalkeeper.\n\nHowarth started his career in the youth system of hometown club York City in 1996 while a schoolboy, before becoming a trainee in 1998. He made his first-team debut aged 17, playing in the first six matches of the 1999–2000 season. During this run in the team, he signed a professional contract with the club. However, he was unable to play regularly for York because of the form of Bobby Mimms and Alan Fettis. After having trials with Premier League and First Division clubs, Howarth left York in November 2002 to sign for Tranmere Rovers for a five-figure fee. Here, he again played sporadically, only having runs in the team when first-choice goalkeeper John Achterberg was unavailable. After being released by Tranmere in 2005, Howarth signed for Bradford City. However, he was unable to dislodge Donovan Ricketts in goal and was released in 2007. He retired from football and started working as a paramedic.\n\nWhile at York, Howarth played for England at a number of youth levels. He was capped twice at under-16 level in 1999, while still a trainee at York. He competed with Chelsea's Rhys Evans for a starting place in the under-18 team, playing for them in 2001 UEFA European Under-18 Championship qualifying. After making four under-18 appearances from 2000 to 2001, he progressed to the under-20 team, competing with Evans, Stephen Bywater and Boaz Myhill for a place in the team. He was capped four times for the team from 2001 to 2002 before being given a late call-up to the under-21 squad for the 2002 UEFA European Under-21 Championship. He was still included in under-21 squads after moving to Tranmere, but failed to be capped at that level.\n\nHowarth was born in York, North Yorkshire to Michael and Lyn Howarth (née Hammond). He was baptised in Riccall, North Yorkshire and attended Barlby High School. As a youth, he played as a goalkeeper for Olympia Station FC, before representing York and District Schools aged 12. In one season, however, he played as a left winger and scored 29 goals. He soon returned to playing in goal and impressed Huntington School teacher Alan Whitehead, a former York City player, who ran the York and District team.\n\nHowarth started his career with hometown club York City in their youth system, joining in 1996 on schoolboy terms. In the summer of 1998, he signed a three-year academy scholarship at York and became a first-year trainee. During May 1999, he played for York in the Candia-66 International Under-20s Tournament, a youth tournament hosted in Europe. York won the tournament after defeating Trenkvin Slowakigie in the final, in which Howarth saved two penalty kicks in the 4–2 penalty shoot-out victory. Aged 17, he made his first-team debut for Third Division York in a 1–0 victory at home to Swansea City in the opening match of the 1999–2000 season on 7 August 1999. He started the season as York's first-choice goalkeeper ahead of the experienced Bobby Mimms, keeping clean sheets in the first three matches. On 26 August 1999, two days after making his fifth successive appearance, Howarth signed a three-year professional contract with York. However, after conceding 11 goals in three matches, and having played in York's first six matches of the season, manager Neil Thompson dropped him for the more experienced Mimms. York's management team insisted Howarth's exclusion was to safeguard him, and was not based on merit. His next appearance came as a 72nd-minute substitute in York's 2–0 defeat away to Plymouth Argyle on 19 February 2000, following an injury to Mimms. Howarth was favoured over Mimms for the following match, a 0–0 draw at home to Exeter City on 26 February 2000. However, following the signing of Northern Ireland international Alan Fettis, Howarth was once again restricted to the substitutes' bench. His first season in senior football finished with eight appearances.\n\nIn May 2000, Howarth played for Premier League club Leeds United in a seven-a-side tournament in Singapore, because their own goalkeepers were unavailable. He also represented York in the Candia-66 International Under-20s Tournament for a second successive summer, although he only played one match as he was being rested after playing for Leeds. His first appearance of 2000–01 came 22 August 2000, in York's 5–1 defeat at home to Stoke City in the League Cup first round first leg. During the match, he fumbled a Graham Fenton cross, and Stoke opened the scoring from the error. He garnered praise from York's part-time goalkeeping coach and former Everton player Neville Southall, who Howarth held as a boyhood hero, saying: \"Russ can be as good as he wants to be. He works hard and has a great attitude when a lot of youngsters today at big clubs don't have such a good attitude. He will succeed. Even if it is in three, five or even ten years, he will succeed.\" With Fettis rested, Howarth made his second appearance of the season on 9 January 2001, starting in a 4–0 defeat at home to Darlington in the Football League Trophy Northern Section first round. Despite conceding four goals, he was the only player to escape criticism from manager Terry Dolan, who said: \"He was let down by everyone else around him. He had no protection whatsoever. His kicking was excellent and he did everything else he had to do without a problem.\" Due to the good form of Fettis, Howarth finished the season with only two appearances.\n\nHowarth made his first appearance of 2001–02 in the 2–0 defeat away to Notts County on 16 October 2001 in the Football League Trophy Northern Section first round. Having made a number of fine saves, he was named man of the match, and Dolan remarked that: \"he is playing as well as I have seen him and he is putting real pressure on Alan Fettis.\" Despite not featuring regularly for York, he spent four days on trial with Premier League club Sunderland, training with the team for three days and playing 45 minutes of a practice match against Huddersfield Town. Howarth then spent a brief period on trial with Wolverhampton Wanderers (Wolves) of the First Division in January 2002. He played for the reserve team against Huddersfield and reportedly impressed manager Dave Jones. Howarth made his first league appearance for York in over two years as a 65th-minute substitute for an injured Fettis a 3–0 home win over Bristol Rovers on 17 April 2002. Two days later, he was offered a new contract by York. With Fettis still injured for the following match, Howarth started for the first time since February 2000 in a 1–0 defeat away to Scunthorpe United on 20 April 2002, York's final match of the season. He finished the season with three appearances.\n\nLarger clubs became interested in buying him during the summer of 2002 and he decided to consider his options before deciding on his future. He trialled with Everton in May 2002, and played in a friendly against Falkirk in the Alex Scott Memorial Trophy, keeping a clean sheet. He revealed he was interested in a move to Everton, and due to Fettis' good form for York, he decided to pursue a move. After his contract expired on 30 June 2002, Howarth joined Wolves for a second trial in July for a two-week period. After playing in Wolves' opening pre-season friendly against Morecambe, he was invited to join them for their pre-season tour of Portugal. Despite being out of contract at York, the club was entitled a fee as he was under 24 years of age, but a bid of £60,000 from Wolves was rejected. He was recalled by York to take part in a pre-season friendly against Sunderland, although he refused to participate. Howarth told Dolan he did not want to play for the club, as any potential injury could have ended his proposed transfer. His proposed move to Wolves continued until August 2002, and late that month he trained with Premier League club Tottenham Hotspur. He played in a practice match for Tottenham, but after they failed to follow up their interest in him Wolves made a bid to sign him on loan, which York rejected. After Marlon Beresford left York, and Howarth's proposed moves elsewhere fell through, he re-signed for the club in September 2002 on a week-to-week contract. Despite this, he spent two days on trial with Premier League club Newcastle United in late September 2002. Howarth's first appearance of 2002–03 came in a 4–3 away defeat to Lincoln City on 22 October 2002 in the Football League Trophy Northern Section first round, after Fettis was rested due to injury.\n\nHowarth left York on 5 November 2002, signing for Second Division club Tranmere Rovers for an undisclosed five-figure fee. York chairman John Batchelor later revealed the transfer fee was an initial figure of £25,000. After signing, Howarth said: \"I felt I had gone a little bit stale at York and the time was right to move on\". He made his debut three weeks later in a 2–1 defeat away to Cardiff City in an FA Cup first-round replay, entering as a 72nd-minute substitute after John Achterberg was sent off. Tranmere did not concede during Howarth's 18 minutes on the pitch, and his performance was positive. However, with Achterberg established in the Tranmere goal, Howarth had to wait until 4 February 2003 to make his league debut away to Cheltenham Town, coming on as a substitute in the 57th minute after Achterberg sustained an injury. He conceded twice as Tranmere lost 3–1. Howarth returned to the substitutes' bench for the following match against Swindon Town on 8 February 2003, as Achterberg had recovered from injury. His first start for Tranmere came over two months later in a 0–0 draw away to Luton Town on 5 April 2003, after Achterberg picked up an injury in training the previous day. He kept his starting place for the following match, a 1–0 victory at home to Wycombe Wanderers on 12 April 2003. Despite keeping clean sheets in both matches, he was dropped for the next match against Notts County on 19 April 2002. He finished 2002–03 with four appearances for Tranmere.\n\nHowarth continued to be kept out of the team in 2003–04, only making his first appearance after Achterberg was injured during the warm-up away to Swindon on 3 March 2004. Tranmere lost 2–0, although his performance was positive, making a number of good saves. However, Achterberg was declared fit for the following match against Millwall on 7 March 2004, and Howarth returned to the substitutes' bench. He did not play another match for Tranmere that season. Howarth's first appearance of 2004–05 came as a 20th-minute substitute after Achterberg was injured away to Hull City on 18 December 2004. After conceding a goal scored by Ian Ashbee in the 34th minute, Howarth was injured in a challenge with Stuart Elliott, and was substituted at half-time. He was available for Tranmere's next match against Barnsley on 26 December 2004, and with Achterberg ruled out for the Christmas period with a knee injury, he started in a 1–1 home draw. This meant Howarth had a run of nine consecutive matches in goal for Tranmere, with an appearance against Oldham Athletic in the Football League Trophy Northern semi-final on 25 January 2005 being his last before Achterberg returned against Luton on 29 January. He failed to play again that season, and was released by Tranmere on 24 May 2005.\n\nOn 8 June 2005, Howarth signed a two-year contract with League One club Bradford City. He was signed to provide competition for Donovan Ricketts, manager Colin Todd saying: \"It was a position we needed filling badly. I am delighted to have got a keeper of Russell's calibre\". Despite having the chance to affirm himself in pre-season with Ricketts away on international duty, it was Ricketts who started 2005–06 as first-choice goalkeeper. Howarth made his debut away to Rotherham United on 20 August 2005, coming on as a 27th-minute substitute after Ricketts was injured. The match finished a 1–1 draw. He made his first start in the subsequent 5–0 away victory over League Two club Rochdale in the League Cup first round on 23 August 2005. These were the first two appearances of a 12-match run in the team, before being dropped after nearly two months when Ricketts returned from injury against Port Vale on 15 October 2005. His last two appearances for Bradford that season, which came when Ricketts was suspended, were a 5–3 defeat at home to Barnsley in an FA Cup second-round replay on 13 December 2005 and a 2–1 defeat at home to Rotherham four days later. Howarth finished his first season at Bradford with a career-record 15 appearances.\n\nAfter starting 2006–07 as second-choice to Ricketts, Howarth sought a loan away from Bradford for first-team football, saying: \"It is approaching make or break in terms of my career. I need to start playing regularly again as soon as possible\". Former club York, by this time playing in the Conference National, made a failed bid to sign him on loan in September 2006. Howarth's first and only appearance of the season, a 2–1 defeat at home to Scunthorpe in the Football League Trophy Northern Section first round on 17 October 2006, proved to be the last of his career. He was released by Bradford on 9 May 2007 and subsequently retired from professional football aged 25.\n\nHowarth received his first international call-up when he was included in the England national under-16 team to play Turkey on 12 January 1999. He was the only player with a club from below the top two divisions to have been selected. He made his debut in the match as a 70th-minute substitute for Chelsea's Rhys Evans, with England winning 2–0. His second cap and first start came two months later in a 1–0 victory at home to Turkey on 30 March 1999. Following the match, Sky Sports commentator Brian Marwood described his performance as \"outstanding\".\n\nHowarth's next international call-up came over a year later when being selected for the under-18s for a match against Luxembourg on 27 April 2000, this time being one of two players with clubs below the top two divisions. He debuted after coming on as a 60th-minute substitute for Evans, in a 2–0 victory for England. Howarth was then called up for a friendly with Israel on 1 September, although he did not feature as Evans was chosen to start. In September 2000, he was named in the team that would participate in a 2001 UEFA European Under-18 Championship qualifying mini-tournament hosted in Ancona, Italy. He failed to appear in the first match against Andorra on 7 October 2000, but made his first start in the next match, a 5–0 victory over the Faroe Islands on 9 October. Howarth was excluded from the line-up for the final match against Italy, which England won to progress to the intermediate qualifying round.\n\nHowarth was called up for a friendly at home to Belgium on 16 November 2000, which he started as England won 3–2, despite Evans having seemingly established himself as the first-choice goalkeeper for the under-18s. He was included in the squad for another friendly against the Netherlands on 1 March 2001, although Evans was chosen to play ahead of Howarth. He was called into the squads to play Poland in the intermediate qualifying round, although he failed to play a part in either leg of the tie, as Evans started in both the 1–0 home loss on 22 March 2001 and the 0–0 away draw on 26 April. With Evans omitted from the squad to play away against Switzerland in a friendly on 30 May 2001, Howarth started in a 1–0 defeat. The match, in which he was substituted for Boaz Myhill of Aston Villa, proved to be his final appearance for the under-18s.\n\nHowarth was ineligible to play for the under-19 team due to an alteration to the England set-up, and was subsequently called up for the under-20 match against Portugal at home on 21 November 2001. The match was England's first at under-20 level since the 1999 FIFA World Youth Championship. He started the match and was substituted for Myhill at half-time, with the team winning 1–0. Howarth came on for England as a half-time substitute for Evans in a 3–0 home victory over Finland on 13 March 2002, in their penultimate friendly ahead of the 2002 Toulon Tournament. A call-up came for the final friendly away to Portugal on 10 April 2002, and he entered as a half-time substitute, this time for Myhill.\n\nAfter originally being left out the squad, he was given a last-minute call-up to play at the Toulon Tournament in May 2002, after Stephen Bywater was called up for the under-21 team. Howarth did not play in the first group match against Poland on 10 May 2002 as Bywater started, but in the second match against Portugal he was chosen ahead of Evans in a 1–0 victory over Portugal on 12 May. However, he was dropped for the final group match against Brazil on 14 May 2002 to make way for Evans, who also played in England's final match in the tournament against Japan on 17 May.\n\nShortly after the under-20s' elimination from the Toulon Tournament, Howarth was called up for the under-21 team playing in the 2002 UEFA European Under-21 Championship after Bywater and Evans picked up injuries. He was an unused substitute for England's final two group matches against Italy and Portugal, and after losing both of these matches the team was eliminated. He was recalled by the under-21s for a match against Yugoslavia on 6 September 2002, although Liverpool's Chris Kirkland started. He was included in the squad for the under-21s' next match against Slovakia on 11 October 2002 in qualification Group 7 of the 2004 UEFA European Under-21 Championship and, despite Kirkland being injured, failed to play as Wolves' Matt Murray was selected. For the following qualifier against Macedonia on 15 October 2002, Howarth failed to make the substitutes' bench. Following his move to Tranmere his international call-ups continued, and he was selected for a get-together of the under-21s in November 2002, ahead of their 2004 UEFA European Under-21 Championship qualifiers against Portugal and Turkey in March and April 2003. However, he did not play in either match, with Bywater and Murray starting. He was given a late call-up to the squad for qualifiers against Macedonia and Portugal in September, but did not eventually meet up with the team as an agreement was reached that he would only be on standby.\n\nFollowing his retirement from football, Howarth became a paramedic. He became a coach for City Football Development in August 2009, which was set up to offer coaching to youngsters in York.\n\nHowarth has been an Everton supporter since the early 1990s. His girlfriend Victoria worked as a deputy head teacher and while Howarth was a Tranmere player the couple lived on the Wirral. Their daughter, Georgia May, was born in late 2004. After signing for Bradford in 2005, Howarth briefly lived with his parents in Riccall before purchasing a second home in Halifax, West Yorkshire to live in with his partner.\n"}
{"id": "33855267", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=33855267", "title": "Smoking in the United Kingdom", "text": "Smoking in the United Kingdom\n\nTobacco smoking in the United Kingdom is prevalent among a sizeable, but continuously reducing minority of the population. Smoking is legally permitted, with certain conditions upon location arising from the bans enacted separately in England, Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland. It has been argued that smoking puts considerable strain upon the NHS due to the health problems which can be directly linked with smoking. Successive UK Governments have endeavoured to reduce the prevalence of smoking. As part of this commitment, the NHS currently offers free help to smokers who want to quit.\n\nAs recently as 1974, 45% of the British population smoked. This was down to 30% by the early-1990s, 21% by 2010, and 19.3% by 2013; the lowest level recorded for eighty years. An annual No Smoking Day has occurred in March since 1984.\n\nIn 2015, it was reported smoking rates in England had fallen to just 16.9%; a record low.\n\nIt has been estimated by Cancer Research UK that smoking is the single greatest cause of preventable illness and early death, with around 107,000 people dying in 2007 from smoking-related diseases including cancers in the UK. Around 86% of lung cancer deaths in the UK are caused by tobacco smoking and overall tobacco smoking is estimated to be responsible for more than a quarter of cancer deaths in the UK, around 43,000 deaths in 2007.\n\nThe British Medical Journal states that due to the drive to help smokers quit smoking, Britain has the world's largest reduction in the number of deaths from lung cancer. Previously in 1950, the UK had one of the highest rates in the world. The annual number of deaths from lung cancer in 2000 was half of what it was in 1965.\n\nReducing the prevalence of smoking to 5% could avoid nearly 100,000 new cases of smoking-related disease including 35,900 cancers over twenty years and save £67,000,000 a year in health and social care costs according to research commissioned by Cancer Research UK.\n\nUntil 1 October 2007, the minimum age to purchase and consume tobacco products in public was 16 years of age. From 1 October 2007 the Children and Young Persons (Sale of Tobacco etc.) Order 2007 became effective, raising the minimum purchase age to 18 years of age. There is no stated age under which it is illegal to consume tobacco, although an officer has the right to confiscate tobacco if the individual concerned is in a public place and under sixteen years of age.\n\nUntil 30 September 2007, the minimum age to purchase and consume tobacco products in public was 16 years of age. From 30 September 2007 the Tobacco and Primary Medical Services (Scotland) Act 2010 became effective, raising the minimum purchase, consumption and possession age to 18 years of age.\n\nUntil 31 August 2008, the minimum age to purchase and consume tobacco products in public was 16 years of age. From 1 September 2008 the Children and Young Persons (Sale of Tobacco etc.) Regulations (Northern Ireland) 2008 became effective, raising the minimum purchase, consumption and possession age to 18 years of age.\n\nSmoking in workplaces and enclosed public spaces has been illegal since 26 March 2006 in Scotland, 2 April 2007 in Wales, 30 April 2007 in Northern Ireland and 1 July 2007 in England, \n\nOn 6 April 2012, the display of tobacco products was banned in retailers larger than 280 square metres in England. With the ban coming into effect in small retailers three years later on 6 April 2015.\n\nIn March 2011, the Conservative-Lib Dem coalition government committed itself to holding a public consultation on the introduction of plain tobacco packaging. Influenced by the introduction of plain packaging in Australia, the House of Commons voted 367–113 in March 2015 to pass the Children and Families Act 2014 which would give the government the power to require plain packaging for tobacco products. This came into force on 20 May 2016, but tobacco companies were given one year to sell off remaining stock; in which afterwards, all tobacco products sold in the UK must follow plain packaging laws.\nOn October 1, 2015 a law was passed which banned smoking in vehicles with anyone under eighteen years of age present. The law does not apply to e-cigarettes, if the driver is seventeen years of age and alone in the vehicle or in a convertible with the roof completely down.\n\nDespite the name, 'e-cigarette,' these devices contain no tobacco and produce no smoke, and therefore any reference to them, should be under e-cigarettes and not smoking. Exceptions to this might be their role as an alternative to smoking, or as devices where it increasingly looks like they are helping young people avoid smoking.\n\nOn 2 April 2014 the Welsh Government published a public health white paper in which it proposed a ban on the use of e-cigarettes in public spaces. The Bill was subsequently defeated.\n\nThe annual Smokefree GB survey, published in May 2017, concluded that 52% of the 2.9 million British e-cigarette users are now ex-smokers. 26% of respondents thought e-cigarettes were as harmful as real cigarettes.

It was the first-ever recall of a genetically modified food. The anti-GMO activist coalition Genetically Engineered Food Alert, which detected and first reported the contamination, was critical of the FDA for not doing its job. The recall of Taco Bell-branded taco shells, manufactured by Kraft Foods and sold in supermarkets, was the most publicized of the recalls. One settlement resulted in $60 million going to Taco Bell franchisees for lost sales due to the damage to the Taco Bell brand.\n\nStarLink is a genetically modified maize, containing two modifications: a gene for resistance to glufosinate, and a variant of the bacillus thuringiensis (Bt) protein called Cry9C. Cry9C had not been used in a GM crop prior to StarLink, causing heightened regulatory scrutiny. StarLink's creator, Plant Genetic Systems, which later became Aventis CropScience during the time of the incident, had applied to the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to market StarLink for use in animal feed and in the human food supply. However, because the Cry9C protein lingers in the digestive system before breaking down, the EPA had concerns about its allergenicity, and PGS did not provide sufficient data to prove that Cry9C was not allergenic. As a result, PGS split its application into separate permits for use in food and use in animal feed only. StarLink was approved by the EPA for use in animal feed only in May 1998. After the incident the company at first tried to get the application for human consumption approved, and then withdrew the product entirely from the market.\n\nThe Garst Seed Company (part of the Advanta group) was licensed by Aventis to produce and sell StarLink seed in the US.\n\nIn 2000, Genetically Engineered Food Alert was launched by seven organizations (Center for Food Safety, Friends of the Earth, Institute for Agriculture and Trade Policy, National Environmental Trust, Organic Consumers Association, Pesticide Action Network North America, and The State PIRGs) to lobby the FDA, Congress and companies to ban or stop using GMOs. One of their activities was testing food for the presence of GMOs via a lab called Genetic ID, the vice president of which was Jeffrey M. Smith.\n\nOn September 18, 2000, Genetically Engineered Food Alert released a statement that Genetic ID had conducted tests on \"Taco Bell Home Originals\" brand taco shells, made by Kraft Foods that had been purchased in a grocery store near Washington, DC, and had detected StarLink; the story was reported on by The Washington Post. Kraft distributed the Taco Bell-branded taco shells under a 1996 license agreement with Taco Bell.\n\nKraft had bought the shells from a Sabritas plant in Mexicali which used flour supplied from an Azteca mill plant in Plainview, Texas. The Texas mill used flour from six states supplied by elevators that did not segregate their genetically modified and conventionally-grown corn at the time. Kraft also suspended production of the recalled products. “All of us — government, industry and the scientific community — need to work on ways to prevent this kind of situation from ever happening again,” said Betsy Holden, Kraft’s chief executive in September 2000. She also stated that food safety and legal compliance were Kraft's main priority.\n\nSafeway later announced it would recall its store brand taco shells at the recommendation of a consumer group on October 12, 2000. This was done as a precaution, and no StarLink was confirmed to be found in any of the products On October 13 and 14, Mission Foods voluntary recalled about 300 products. On October 22, 2000 it was reported that Kellogg's had shut down a plant as a precaution because they couldn't guarantee that StarLink corn flour had not been supplied to the plant.\n\nOn October 26, 2000 StarLink corn was reported to be found in Japan and South Korea. The market and distribution network for corn in the US was thrown into disarray through 2001, as there were no existing means to segregate the grain; the disarray eventually eased due to the Aventis' testing and buyback program discussed below.\n\nIn January 2001 under a written agreement with 17 US states, Aventis initiated a program called the StarLink Enhanced Stewardship (SES) program, under which StarLink corn, buffer corn, and any corn stored in grain elevators that had become mixed with StarLink, would be bought by Aventis and directed to animal feed and non-food industrial use (e.g. ethanol production); the program included free kits to test for StarLink, and covered costs of cleaning equipment, transport, and storage facilities, as well as increased transportation costs. Aventis estimated the cost would be between $100 million to $1 billion.\n\nIt was estimated that due to grain mixing StarLink corn could have existed in more than 50% of the US corn supply and that overall, the StarLink incident depressed the price of US corn about 7% for about a year.\n\nFollowing the recalls, 51 people reported adverse effects to the FDA; these reports were reviewed by the US Centers for Disease Control (CDC), which determined that 28 of them were possibly related to StarLink. The CDC studied the blood of these 28 individuals and concluded there was no evidence the reactions these people experienced were associated with hypersensitivity to the StarLink Bt protein.\n\nThe EPA was criticized by Joseph Mendelson III of the Center for Food Safety, who said \"Clearly they didn't do anything here until they became embarrassed.\" The EPA and Aventis were also criticized for statements at the time of the recall that indicated they had no idea such a thing would happen. \"If there has been a violation of our licensing process, then we would have a very great concern,\" was attributed to Stephen Johnson of the EPA. Margaret Gadsby of Aventis was quoted with her earlier statement \"We have difficulty imagining how our corn could end up in the human food supply.\"\n\nThe registration for the StarLink varieties was voluntarily withdrawn by Aventis in October 2000. In February 2001, it was announced that the president, general counsel, and vice president of market development for Aventis CropScience (US), had been fired in response to the recall.\n\nIn June 2001 Tricon Global Restaurants, 20% owners of Taco Bell at the time, announced a $60 million settlement with some of the suppliers of the supermarket taco shells; under the terms of the settlement they could not disclose the identity of suppliers. Tricon stated that the settlement would go to Taco Bell franchisees and Tricon would not receive any of it. Tricon also announced that it, along with the suppliers and franchisees, would initiate litigation against the parties responsible for StarLink entering the food chain.\n\nIn September 2001, a group of about 5,000 Taco Bell franchisees and a handful of taco shell suppliers brought a class-action lawsuit against Aventis, Garst Seed Co.; Gruma Corp., (\"the largest producer and distributor of corn flour and tortillas in the United States) and Azteca Milling seeking damages. This suit was voluntarily dismissed in December 2001.\n\nIn 2002, Aventis, Garst, Kraft Foods, Azteca Foods, Azteca Milling, and Mission Foods settled a lawsuit brought by two people, and the grandmother of a third, who claimed to have had allergic reactions to StarLink, for $9 million.\n\nIn 2002, nongovernmental organizations claimed that aid sent by the UN and the US to Central American nations also contained some StarLink corn. The nations involved, Nicaragua, Honduras, El Salvador and Guatemala refused to accept the aid.\n\nIn 2003, farmers who did not plant StarLink who had suffered economic losses due to depressed corn prices following the StarLink recalls settled a class-action lawsuit against Aventis and Advanta for $100 million.\n\nGeneWatch UK and Greenpeace International set up the GM Contamination Register in 2005 citing these recalls as one of the \"highlights\" of the register.\n\nThe US corn supply was monitored by the Federal Grain Inspection Service for the presence of the StarLink Bt proteins from 2001 until 2010.\n\nIn August 2013, StarLink corn was reported to be found again contaminating some foods in Saudi Arabia.\n\n"}

From late September through October of each year, farmers mainly from Punjab and Haryana burn an estimated 35 million tons of crop waste from their wheat fields after harvesting, as a low-cost straw-disposal practice to reduce the turnaround time between harvesting and sowing for the second (winter) crop. Smoke from this burning produces a cloud of particulates visible in images from space, and has produced a \"toxic cloud\" in New Delhi, resulting in declarations of an air-pollution emergency. For this, NGT (National Green Tribunal) slapped a fine of Rs. 2 lakh on the Delhi Government for not filing an action plan providing incentives and infrastructural assistance to farmers to stop them from burning crop residue to prevent air pollution.\n\nAlthough harvesters are available such as the Indian-manufactured \"Happy Seeder\" that shred the crop residues into small pieces and uniformly spread them across the field, as an alternative to burning the crops, farmers complain that the cost of these machines is prohibitive compared to burning the fields.\n\n"}

A subclinically infected person is thus an asymptomatic carrier of a microbe, intestinal parasite, or virus that usually is a pathogen causing illness, at least in some individuals. Many pathogens spread by being silently carried in this way by some of their host population. Such infections occur both in humans and nonhuman animals. An example of an asymptomatic infection is a mild common cold that is not noticed by the infected individual. Since subclinical infections often occur without eventual overt sign, their existence is only identified by microbiological culture or DNA techniques such as polymerase chain reaction.\n\nAn individual may only develop signs of an infection after a period of subclinical infection, a duration that is called the incubation period. This is the case, for example, for subclinical sexually transmitted diseases such as AIDS and genital warts. Individuals with such subclinical infections, and those that never develop overt illness, creates a reserve of individuals that can transmit an infectious agent to infect other individuals. Because such cases of infections do not come to clinical attention, health statistics can often fail to measure the true prevalence of an infection in a population, and this prevents the accurate modeling of its infectious transmission.\n\nThe following pathogens (together with their symptomatic illnesses) are known to be carried asymptomatically, often in a large percentage of the potential host population: \n\nFever and sickness behavior and other signs of infection are often taken to be due to them. However, they are evolved physiological and behavioral responses of the host to clear itself of the infection. Instead of incurring the costs of deploying these evolved responses to infections, the body opts to tolerate an infection as an alternative to seeking to control or remove the infecting pathogen.\n\nSubclinical infections are important since they allow infections to spread from a reserve of carriers. They also can cause clinical problems unrelated to the direct issue of infection. For example, in the case of urinary tract infections in women, this infection may cause preterm delivery if the person becomes pregnant without proper treatment.\n"}

The bulb was then secured by twine or a rubber band. The baby's saliva would slowly dissolve the sugar in the bulb. \n\nIn use the exposed outfolded fabric could give the appearance of a flower in the baby's mouth. David Ransel quotes a Russian study by Dr. N. E.

{"id": "5460467", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=5460467", "title": "Xenoma", "text": "Xenoma\n\nA xenoma (also known as a 'xenoparasitic complex') is a growth caused by various protists and fungi, most notably microsporidia. It can occur on numerous organisms; however is predominantly found on fish.\nIn most cases the host cell and nuclei suffers from hypertrophy resulting in a change in organisation of the cell and its structure and can result in polyploid nuclei. This outcome is due to the microsporidian parasite proliferating inside the host cell. This results in a 'symbiotic co-existence' between the parasite and the host cell. This forms the xenoparasitic complex. They tend to contain numerous cellular components as well as microsporidia at different developmental stages and spores.\n\nNot all microsporidia infections result in the formation of xenomas; only a few microsporidia actually cause xenoma formation.\n\nXenoparasitic complex was the term initially devised in the early twentieth century to describe specific type 'tumours' found on various organisms, specific as the infections were caused by multiple subclasses of microsporidia. A paper published in 1922 by Weissenberg came up with the term 'xenon' for the xenoparasitic complexes he observed on sticklebacks caused by \"Glugea anomala\", before eventually changing it to xenoma (xenon was already the name of a newly discovered chemical element).\n\nHypertrophy of cells caused by protists and fungi has been observed since the late nineteenth century. Scientists observed them in several organisms, of which the infection would have varied host cell specificity, ultimately leading to different cellular consequences. For example, the dinoflagellate protist \"Sphaeripara catenata\" induces hypertrophy, polyploid nuclei formation whilst forming a thick-walled hyposome where rhizoids extend into the cytoplasm for nutrient absorption in the appendicularian \"Fritillaria pellucida\". This can be contrasted to the \"Microsporidium cotti\" infection of the testes of \"Taurulus bubalis\" where a dense microvillus layer is present for improved nutrient absorption.\n\nXenomas are provoked in various types of organisms, depending on the species of the parasite. Microsporidia are known to produce xenomas in oligochaetes, insects, crustaceans and fish. In addition to organism specificity, different species of parasite will have distinct host cell specificity, even if targeting the same organism. For example, \"Microsporidium chaetogastris\" infects solely connective and muscle tissue cells of the annelid \"Chaetogaster diaphanus\", whereas other species of microsporidia will target other tissue types. Another example is microsporidial gill disease in different species of fish caused by \"Loma salmonae\". It was found that certain species had a higher prevalence of xenoma formation following infection with the same parasite i.e. xenomas per gill filament in chinook salmon was 8 to 33 times greater than in rainbow trout, showing differences in host cell susceptibility.\nOnce a host cell is infected with the microsporidian (or protist) parasite, a complete restructuring of the host cell ensues. This occurs as the parasite seeks to take control of the metabolism of the cell, in order to survive and exploit the host cell's resources and reproduction. It provides the parasite with optimal growth conditions and protection from the host's immune response. The parasite proliferates within the host cell where its mass replaces most of the host cell's cytoplasm, with the rest being taken up by microvillus structures and rhizoids. Other structures may be present inside the infected host cell including vesicles, fat globules and bundles of fibril. The nucleus may be in varying locations including the centre of the cell and may also vary in structure i.e. lobed, branched or divided into multiple fragments, but it will always be hypertrophic. The host also commonly envelops the proliferating parasite and the host cell itself in layers of membranes and cells.\n\nIn microsporidian xenomas the whole life cycle is restricted to the xenoma; this however differs between different protists. The life cycle predominantly follows a simple life cycle consisting of merogony followed by sporogony. Occasionally the endoplasmic reticulum associates with meronts, which are formed during merogony, and is lost once sporogony ensues. The time it takes for a xenoma to develop varies entirely on the host organism and cell as well as the infecting parasite. It can vary, however it usually starts to form after a few weeks following infection, depending on the life cycle of the parasite. The size of xenomas also varies with the type of parasite and host organism, and can range from a few micrometres to several millimetres.\n\nWhile it is generally accepted that the xenoma prevents spread of the parasite throughout the host organism, it is not entirely accurate. As the species that cause xenomas are spore-forming, it is possible that their spores may release their sporoplasms which penetrate the xenoma wall, infiltrating and infecting surrounding cells. In microsporidia this is mediated by a unique and highly specialised protein: the polar tube. This specialised protein is found inside the spore and is in contact with the sporoplasm. Specific environmental stimulation causes the spore to discharge the polar tube which penetrates the xenoma membrane and provides an exit route for the sporoplasm. This is thought to be a form of autoinfection. Rupture of the xenoma may also result in dispersal of the infectious spores. This can lead to the formation of other and more persistent forms of xenomas.\n\nTransmission of such pathogens occurs predominantly via oral administration when in contact or in the vicinity of diseased organisms via the release of infectious spores. However, there are reports of obtaining infection in some organisms through the skin. Experimentally inducing infection and xenoma formation can be performed intramuscularly, intravascularly and intraperitoneally. It is widely thought that the first site of entry for many of these parasites is in the gastrointestinal tract where enzymes such as pepsin or even an alkaline pH shift (caused by the mucous layer prominent in this area) induces polar tube discharge. Following this their migration from their initial release to their final destination in the host cell varies considerably, depending on the pathogen, the host organism and the host cell location. It was discovered through \"in situ\" hybridization that the microsporidia \"Loma salmonae\" enters the mucosal epithelium in the intestine and migrates to the lamina propria before arriving at the gills, where it eventually resides, via infecting blood cells. Other transport vehicles are thought to include T cells, lymphocytes, and other migratory cells including monocytes where they succumb to infection by means of either phagocytosis of the parasite in the lamina propria or by infiltration by sporoplasms using their polar tube. It is also very possible that these transport cells might themselves develop into a xenoma.\n\nMicrosporidia is a common cause of disease in fish and so xenomas tend to be seen more frequently in fish than in other organisms. A paper published in 2002 listed 15 genera and 157 microsporidian species that cause disease in fish, however only ten of these genera induce xenoma formation. Microsporidia genera that cause xenomas can therefore be quite diverse and so are characterised more comprehensively into several groups depending on their morphology:\n\n\nRecently fish-infecting microsporidia have been grouped into five classes depending on their molecular traits, a higher level of classification using SSU (small subunit) rDNA analysis. However molecular data is still lacking for several genera of microsporidia.\n\nWhilst xenomas are more highly characteristic of fish, they can be quite extensive in other organisms including crustaceans, insects, oligochaetes and other vertebrates. Microsporidian xenomas that develop in fish can also occur in crustaceans. Roughly 43 microsporidian genera have been found to infect crustaceans, with at least 23 microsporidian species found in shrimp, most of them infecting muscular tissue. Other species also infect the digestive tract, reproductive organs and their hepatopancreas. Xenoma-like formations have also been found in species of shrew caused by \"Soricimyxum fegati\", a type of myxosporea, showing they can also occur in mammals.\n\nThe host can eventually destroy the xenoma. Proliferative inflammation occurs in mature xenomas and transforms them into granulomas. Granuloma involution then ensues where phagocytosis kills the spores.\n\nStudies have shown it is possible to vaccinate against xenomas. One study showed that developing a vaccine using a 10 to 10 dose of killed spores from a low-virulence strain of \"Loma salmonae\" resulted in rainbow trout producing 85% less xenomas in their gills after experimental infection (compared to the control). This ultimately offers much improved protection to microsporidial gill disease which is common amongst rainbow trout. Therapeutic drugs have proved ineffective at treating this disease and harvesting whole-spores is a relatively easy technique.\n\n"}
