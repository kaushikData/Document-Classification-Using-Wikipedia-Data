Anatomical diagrams generated by Anatomography, and 3D polygon data used on the website (called BodyParts3D), are freely available under the Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike license.\n\nAnatomography was launched on Feb. 9, 2009 by founder and chief director Kousaku Okubo (), professor of the DNA Data Bank of Japan at the National Institute of Genetics.\n\nHuman body polygon data used in the site are called \"BodyParts3D\". BodyParts3D polygon data are extracted from full-body MRI images. The MRI image set that BodyParts3D is based on is called \"TARO\". Taro is a common given name for males in Japanese, as John is in English. TARO is a 2mm * 2mm * 2mm voxel dataset of the human male created by the National Institute of Information and Communications Technology. TARO was published freely on November, 2004.\n\nThe construction process of BodyParts3D is as follows.\n\nBodyParts3D polygon data are distributed in the OBJ file format. The entire data file's size is 127 MB (polygon reduced) and 521 MB (high quality) as of version 3.0. The number of body parts (organs) registered in BodyParts3D is 1,523 as of version 3.0.\n\nImages generated by Anatomography and the polygon data included in BodyParts3D are licensed under the Creative Commons license, in hope of widening usage and democratizing medical knowledge.\n\nThe BodyParts3D/Anatomography project was funded by MEXT (Japanese Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology) from FY2007 to FY2010. As of FY2011, the project has been funded by the JST (Japan Science and Technology Agency).\n\nDiagrams from Anatomography are used, for example, in Canadian science TV show , Internet encyclopedia Wikipedia, as lecture material in universities, and elsewhere to share knowledge. About usage of Anatomography on websites like Wikipedia and Wikimedia Commons, developers say \"spreading of usages by anonymous users on like Wikipedia and Wikimedia Commons is what we had expected.\"\n\nBodyParts3D/Anatomography project uses the Foundational Model of Anatomy (FMA). The FMA is an open-source anatomical ontology developed and maintained by the Structural Informatics Group at the University of Washington. In BodyParts3D, each body-part is managed by an FMA identifier (FMAID) defined by the FMA. For example, the vertebral column is registered as \"FMA13478\", the temporal lobe is registered as \"FMA61825\", and so on.\n\n\n\nA few tutorial videos on using Anatomography are available on YouTube, see external links.\n\n\n"}

ANMs are regarded as the grass-roots workers in the health organisation pyramid. Their services are considered important to provide safe and effective care to village communities. The role may help communities achieve the targets of national health programmes.\n\nThe Mukherjee Committee in 1966 prescribed a system of targets and incentives and identified ANMs and other village-level workers as agents for the popularization of the health programmes. In the 1950s and 1960s, training of ANMs mainly focused on midwifery and mother and child health. \n\nIn 1973, the Kartar Singh Committee of the Government of India combined the functions of the health services and changed the role of ANMs. The committee recommended that there should be 1 ANM available per 10,000-12,000 people.\n\nIn 1975, the Srivastava Committee recommended expansion in the role of ANM. Recommended expansion included the role of an ANM as a multipurpose health worker. Along with maternity care, the committee recommended that the ANM's work include child health (immunization) and primary curative care of villagers. The Indian Nursing Council (INC) accepted the recommendations of the committee and included them in the syllabus in 1977. This decision also reduced the training period of the ANM from 24 months to 18 months.\n\nIn 1986, the National Education Policy gave the ANM programme a status of Vocational Education. Following this decision, the INC again reviewed its policy and recommended that the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare make the ANM course vocational at +2 level (after 10th class/higher secondary level). However, only a few states of India have made the ANM course a vocational course at the higher secondary level of schooling. According to the latest guidelines by INC, the minimum age for admission to an ANM course should be 17 years while the maximum age limit is 35 years.\n\nIn 2005, the National Rural Health Mission (NRHM) was launched, which focused on improvising primary health care in villages and further increased the importance of the ANM as a link between health services and the community.\n\nANMs works at health sub-centres. The sub-centre is a small village-level institution that provides primary health care to the community. The sub-centre works under the Primary Health Centre (PHC). Each PHC usually has around six such sub-centres. Before the launch of the NRHM in 2005, there was provision of one ANM per sub-centre. Later it was found that one ANM was not adequate to fulfill the health care requirements of a village. In 2005 NRHM made provision of two ANMs (one permanent and one contractual) for each sub-centre. The ANM is usually selected from the local village to increase accountability. \n\nAs per the Rural Health Statistics Bulletin of 2010, there were 147,069 sub-centres functioning in India, which were increased to 152,326 in March 2014. As per recent norms, there should be one sub-centre for population of 5,000 while in tribal and hilly area population allotted for each sub-centre is 3,000.\n\nUnder NRHM, each sub-centre gets an untied fund of Rs 10,000 for expenditure. The ANM has a joint bank account with the Sarpanch (head) of the village to get such funds. ANMs use untied fund for buying items needed for sub-centre, such as blood pressure equipment, weighing machine, scales and for cleaning. The rate of deliveries at the sub-centre level has been increased since the grant of untied funds via NRHM.\n\nANMs are expected to be multi-purpose health workers. ANM-related work includes maternal and child health along with family planning services, health and nutrition education, efforts for maintaining environmental sanitation, immunisation for the control of communicable diseases, treatment of minor injuries, and first aid in emergencies and disasters.\n\nIn remote areas, such as hilly and tribal areas where transport facility is likely to be poor, ANMs are required to conduct home deliveries for women.\n\nThe Accredited Social Health Activist (ASHA) is a community health worker. Depending on the area covered by the sub-centre, each ANM is supported by four or five ASHAs. ANMs are supposed to take weekly or fortnightly meeting with ASHAs to review work done the last week or fortnight. ANMs guides ASHAs on aspects of health care. \n\nWith the Anganwadi Worker (AWW), the ANM acts as a resource person for the training of ASHAs. The ANM motivates ASHAs to bring beneficiaries to the institution. The ASHA brings pregnant women to the ANM for check-ups. She also brings married couples to the ANM for counseling on the family planning. The ASHA brings children to immunisation sessions held by the ANM. The ASHA act as bridge between the ANM and the village.\n"}

This scoring allows for the estimation of age in the range of 26 weeks-44 weeks. The New Ballard Score is an extension of the above to include extremely pre-term babies i.e. up to 20 weeks.\n\nThe scoring relies on the intra-uterine changes that the fetus undergoes during its maturation. Whereas the neurological criteria depend mainly upon muscle tone, the physical ones rely on anatomical changes. The neonate (less than 37 weeks of age) is in a state of physiological hypotonia. This tone increases throughout the fetal growth period, meaning a more premature baby would have lesser muscle tone.\n\nIt was developed in 1979.\n\nThese are:\n\nThese are:\n\nEach of the above criteria are scored from 0 through 5, in the original Ballard Score.

Hygieia was the Greek goddess of Health hygiene, and the associate, wife, or daughter of Asclepius. Asclepius' symbol is his rod, with a snake twined around it; correspondingly, Hygieia's symbol is a cup or chalice with a snake twined around its stem and poised above it.\n\nThe bowl of Hygieia has been used as a symbol of the pharmacy profession at least as far back as 1796, when it was used on a coin minted for the Parisian Society of Pharmacy. It has since been adopted by many more pharmaceutical associations worldwide, such as the American Pharmacists Association, the Canadian Pharmacists Association, the Pharmaceutical Society of Australia, and the Doctor of pharmacy Association, \"Conseil de l'Ordre des Pharmaciens\" in France (where is written in law with another symbol, the green Greek cross).\n\nThe bowl of Hygieia is a common symbol on signs outside of pharmacies in Europe. A mortar and pestle is a more common symbol in the United States. \n\nThe Bowl of Hygeia Award is an award given by state, provincial, and national pharmacist associations in the United States and Canada to recognize living pharmacists who \"possess outstanding records of civic leadership in their communities,\" while \"[encouraging] pharmacists to take active roles in their communities.\"\n\nThe award was established in 1958 by E. Claiborne Robins Sr, president of A.H. Robins of Richmond, Virginia, and first presented by the Iowa Pharmaceutical Association at its annual convention.\n\nIn 1961, Robins's Bowl of Hygeia Award program expanded to Canada, and by 1967 it was being given by the pharmacists' associations in all 50 U.S. states as well as the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, and all 10 Canadian provinces.\n\nIn 1989, American Home Products acquired A. H. Robins, and the company's Wyeth-Ayerst Laboratories division took over sponsorship of the award. (In 2002 AHP changed its name to Wyeth.)\n\nWyeth was acquired by Pfizer in 2009, and in 2010 the company transferred \"all rights and responsibilities of the award\" to the pharmacy profession as a whole. Today it is managed by the American Pharmacists Association (APhA), the National Alliance of State Pharmacy Associations (NASPA), and the APhA Foundation. \n\nState, provincial, and national pharmacists' associations now each select and sponsor their annual Bowl of Hygeia winners.\n\nThe University of California, San Francisco School of Pharmacy, which is one of the nation's top-ranked pharmacy schools according to US News, bestows a Bowl Of Hygeia Award each year to a single graduating student from the School of Pharmacy. The student is selected by his or her classmates along with the faculty members and is selected based on which individual most exemplifies the desirable qualities of a pharmacist\n\nIn September 2015, a controversy erupted when an APhA Foundation-sponsored \"Bowl of Hygeia\" award was given to Louisiana pharmacist Lloyd Duplantis, who not only was a prominent figure in a movement of pharmacists who refused to dispense the birth control pill, but had self-published a book considered full of pseudo-scientific theories, the most notorious being a contention that high-dose estrogen birth control pills lead to an increase in \"effeminate men\" and homosexuality. The book also theorized that since these type of pills were tested in Haiti during the 1950s, by the 1970s a higher percentage of the population would be homosexual, and that a \"unique population transfer\" occurred during that time between Haiti and Zaire, where the AIDS virus had been created as a result of \"errant vaccine experiments\", so that the Haitians then contracted the virus and brought it to the Western Hemisphere. Despite calls for APhA to rescind this award, the organization has stood by its decision.\n"}

Ultrasound contrast agents rely on the different ways in which sound waves are reflected from interfaces between substances. This may be the surface of a small air bubble or a more complex structure. Commercially available contrast media are gas-filled microbubbles that are administered intravenously to the systemic circulation. Microbubbles have a high degree of echogenicity (the ability of an object to reflect ultrasound waves). There is a great difference in echogenicity between the gas in the microbubbles and the soft tissue surroundings of the body. Thus, ultrasonic imaging using microbubble contrast agents enhances the ultrasound backscatter, (reflection) of the ultrasound waves, to produce a sonogram with increased contrast due to the high echogenicity difference. Contrast-enhanced ultrasound can be used to image blood perfusion in organs, measure blood flow rate in the heart and other organs, and for other applications.\n\nTargeting ligands that bind to receptors characteristic of intravascular diseases can be conjugated to microbubbles, enabling the microbubble complex to accumulate selectively in areas of interest, such as diseased or abnormal tissues. This form of molecular imaging, known as targeted contrast-enhanced ultrasound, will only generate a strong ultrasound signal if targeted microbubbles bind in the area of interest. Targeted contrast-enhanced ultrasound may have many applications in both medical diagnostics and medical therapeutics. However, the targeted technique has not yet been approved by the FDA for clinical use in the United States.\n\nContrast-enhanced ultrasound is regarded as safe in adults, comparable to the safety of MRI contrast agents, and better than radiocontrast agents used in contrast CT scans. The more limited safety data in children suggests that such use is as safe as in the adult population.\n\nAn echocardiogram is a study of the heart using ultrasound. A bubble echocardiogram is an extension of this that uses simple air bubbles as a contrast medium during this study and often has to be requested specifically.\n\nAlthough colour Doppler can be used to detect abnormal flows between the chambers of the heart (e.g., persistent (patent) foramen ovale), it has a limited sensitivity. When specifically looking for a defect such as this, small air bubbles can be used as a contrast medium and injected intravenously, where they travel to the right side of the heart. The test would be positive for an abnormal communication if the bubbles are seen passing into the left side of the heart. (Normally, they would exit the heart through the pulmonary artery and be stopped by the lungs.) This form of bubble contrast medium is generated on an \"ad hoc\" basis by the testing clinician by agitating normal saline (e.g., by rapidly and repeatedly transferring the saline between two connected syringes) immediately prior to injection.\n\nThere are a variety of microbubble contrast agents. Microbubbles differ in their shell makeup, gas core makeup, and whether or not they are targeted.\n\n\nRegardless of the shell or gas core composition, microbubble size is fairly uniform. They lie within a range of 1–4 micrometres in diameter. That makes them smaller than red blood cells, which allows them to flow easily through the circulation as well as the microcirculation.\n\n\nTargeted microbubbles are under preclinical development. They retain the same general features as untargeted microbubbles, but they are outfitted with ligands that bind specific receptors expressed by cell types of interest, such as inflamed cells or cancer cells. Current microbubbles in development are composed of a lipid monolayer shell with a perflurocarbon gas core. The lipid shell is also covered with a polyethylene glycol (PEG) layer. PEG prevents microbubble aggregation and makes the microbubble more non-reactive. It temporarily “hides” the microbubble from the immune system uptake, increasing the amount of circulation time, and hence, imaging time. In addition to the PEG layer, the shell is modified with molecules that allow for the attachment of ligands that bind certain receptors. These ligands are attached to the microbubbles using carbodiimide, maleimide, or biotin-streptavidin coupling. Biotin-streptavidin is the most popular coupling strategy because biotin’s affinity for streptavidin is very strong and it is easy to label the ligands with biotin. Currently, these ligands are monoclonal antibodies produced from animal cell cultures that bind specifically to receptors and molecules expressed by the target cell type. Since the antibodies are not humanized, they will elicit an immune response when used in human therapy. Humanizing antibodies is an expensive and time-intensive process, so it would be ideal to find an alternative source of ligands, such as synthetically manufactured targeting peptides that perform the same function, but without the immune issues.\n\nThere are two forms of contrast-enhanced ultrasound, untargeted (used in the clinic today) and targeted (under preclinical development). The two methods slightly differ from each other.\n\nUntargeted microbubbles, such as the aforementioned SonoVue, Optison, or Levovist, are injected intravenously into the systemic circulation in a small bolus. The microbubbles will remain in the systemic circulation for a certain period of time. During that time, ultrasound waves are directed on the area of interest. When microbubbles in the blood flow past the imaging window, the microbubbles’ compressible gas cores oscillate in response to the high frequency sonic energy field, as described in the ultrasound article. The microbubbles reflect a unique echo that stands in stark contrast to the surrounding tissue due to the orders of magnitude mismatch between microbubble and tissue echogenicity. The ultrasound system converts the strong echogenicity into a contrast-enhanced image of the area of interest. In this way, the bloodstream’s echo is enhanced, thus allowing the clinician to distinguish blood from surrounding tissues.\n\nTargeted contrast-enhanced ultrasound works in a similar fashion, with a few alterations. Microbubbles targeted with ligands that bind certain molecular markers that are expressed by the area of imaging interest are still injected systemically in a small bolus. Microbubbles theoretically travel through the circulatory system, eventually finding their respective targets and binding specifically. Ultrasound waves can then be directed on the area of interest. If a sufficient number of microbubbles have bound in the area, their compressible gas cores oscillate in response to the high frequency sonic energy field, as described in the ultrasound article. The targeted microbubbles also reflect a unique echo that stands in stark contrast to the surrounding tissue due to the orders of magnitude mismatch between microbubble and tissue echogenicity. The ultrasound system converts the strong echogenicity into a contrast-enhanced image of the area of interest, revealing the location of the bound microbubbles. Detection of bound microbubbles may then show that the area of interest is expressing that particular molecular marker, which can be indicative of a certain disease state, or identify particular cells in the area of interest.\n\nUntargeted contrast-enhanced ultrasound is currently applied in echocardiography and radiology. Targeted contrast-enhanced ultrasound is being developed for a variety of medical applications.\n\nUntargeted microbubbles like Optison and Levovist are currently used in echocardiography. In addition, SonoVue ultrasound contrast agent is used in radiology for lesion characterization. \n\n\nOn top of the strengths mentioned in the medical sonography entry, contrast-enhanced ultrasound adds these additional advantages:\n\nIn addition to the weaknesses mentioned in the medical sonography entry, contrast-enhanced ultrasound suffers from the following disadvantages:\n\n"}

Cricut is among several electronic die cutters used by paper crafters, card makers and scrapbookers.\n\nThe original cricut machine had cutting mats of 6 × 12 inches, the larger \"Cricut Expression\" only allows mats of 12 × 12 and 12 × 24. The largest machine will produce letters from a half inch to 23 inches high. Both the \"Cricut\" and \"Cricut Expression\" require mats and blades which can be adjusted to cut through various types of paper, vinyl and other sheet products. The \"Cricut personal paper cutter\" operates as a paper cutter based upon cutting parameters programmed into the machine, and resembles a desktop printer. \"Cricut Cake\" produces stylized edible fondants cut into various shapes from fondant sheets, and is used by chefs in the preparation and ornamentation of cakes.\n\nThe original cricut comes with a 6\" x 12\" cutting mat and images can be cut in a range from 1\" to 5 1/2\" tall. The original cricut is compatible with all original cricut cartridges. The original cricut does not have the ability to cut as many different types of materials that the newer cricut machines can. However Cricut does make a Deep Cut Blade & Housing that can allow original cricut owners to cut material up to 1.55mm thick, such as magnet, chipboard, and stamp materials. The original cricut is also compatible with the Cricut Design Craft Room.\n\nThe Cricut Expression® offers several advantages over the previous model. First, it allows users to cut shapes and fonts in a range from ¼\" to 23½\", and comes with a 12\" x 12\" cutting matting with adjustable slides so that users no longer need to trim their media down to 6\" x 12\". It cuts a wider range of materials, including vellum, fabric, chipboard, vinyl, and thin foils. It also features an LCD Screen to preview the work, and has features such Quantity and Auto-Fill. A \"Paper Saver\" mode and choice of Portrait or Landscape Orientation have also been added. The basic model has two cartridges included in the purchase, Plantin SchoolBook and Accent Essentials.\n\nThe cricut expression 2 has an updated exterior from the cricut expression. It comes with a 12\" x 12\" cutting mat. This machine does not have the keyboard that the original cricut and the cricut expression have. Instead it features a new full-color LCD touch screen. The LCD touch screen displays the keyboard on the screen and allows you to see where your images will be on the mat prior to cutting. It also has the new feature of independent image sizing and image rotation directly on the LCD screen.\n\nThe cricut mini is a small personal electronic cutting machine. Unlike the other cricut machines it only works with a computer, it can not cut images standing alone. You have to use Cricut Craft Room design software. The cricut mini comes with over 500 images that are automatically unlocked when you connect your cricut with the Cricut Craft Room design software or the Cricut Gypsy device. The machine does have a cartridge port that is compatible with all cricut cartridges except the cricut imagine cartridges. The cricut mini also features a unique mat size of 8.5\" x 12\". The cricut mini can cut images in a range of 1/4\" to 11 1/2\".\nThe Cricut Mini relied exclusively on using Cricut Craft Room, a computer program which no longer functions. Of all the Legacy Cricut machines, the Mini is the only one that is now obsolete and not usable in any way. As no recourse was provided to the customers who had purchased cartridges for that machine, Provo-Craft is now the focus of many complaints for customers who were left with no recourse for this unexpected forced 'sun-setting' of the machine.\n\nThe Explore Air is a wireless die cutting machine that can cut a variety of materials from paper to fabric and more.\n\nThe Explore Air 2 is minor refresh of the Explore Air line which added three colors (Mint Blue, Rose Anna, Giffin Lilac) as well as a Fast Mode to cut vinyl, iron-on, and cardstock at \"up to 2x speeds.\"\n\nThe Cricut Maker is a new line released on August 20, 2017, designed to cut thicker materials such as Balsawood, Basswood, non-bonded fabric, leather, and felt.\n\nThe Maker is the only Cricut machine that supports the use of a Rotary Blade for cutting fabric directly, and a scoring wheel with variable pressure to score thicker papers than the original scoring stylus.\n\nDesigns are made from components stored on cartridges. Each cartridge comes with a keyboard overlay and instruction booklet. The plastic keyboard overlay indicates key selections for that cartridge only. However recently Provo Craft has released a \"Universal Overlay\" that is compatible with all cartridges released after August 1, 2013. The purpose of the universal overlay is to simplify the process of cutting by only having to learn one keyboard overlay instead of having to learn the overlay for each individual cartridge. Designs can be cut out on a PC with the Cricut Design Studio software, on a USB connected Gypsy machine, or can be directly inputed on the Cricut machine using the keyboard overlay. There are two types of cartridges shape and font. Each cartridge has a variety of creative features which can allow for hundreds of different cuts from just one cartridge. There are currently over 275 cartridges that are available (separately from the machine), containing fonts and shapes, with new ones added monthly. While some cartridges are generic in content, Cricut has licensing agreements with Disney, Pixar, Nickelodeon, Sesame Street, DC Comics and Hello Kitty. The Cricut line has a range of prices, but the cartridges are interchangeable, although not all options on a cartridge may be available with the smaller machines. All cartridges work only with Cricut software, must be registered to a single user for use and cannot be sold or given away. A cartridge purchased for a discontinued machine is likely to become useless at the point the machine is discontinued. Cricut reserves the right to discontinue support for some versions of their software at any time, which can make some cartridges immediately obsolete.\n\nThe Cricut Craft Room software enables users to combine images from different cartridges, merge images, and stretch/rotate images; it does not allow for the creation of arbitrary designs. It also enables the user to view the images displayed on-screen before beginning the cutting process, so the end result can be seen in advance.\n\nCiting Adobe's abandonment of Flash, Cricut announced it would be closing Cricut Craft Room on 15 July 2018. Users of \"legacy\" machines were offered a discount to update to models compatible with Cricut Design Space. As of 16 July 2018, Design Space is the only software available to compose projects. Design Space is not compatible with cartridges formerly purchased for the Cricut Mini, which was force-sunset in October 2018.\n\nProvo Craft has been actively hostile to the use of third-party software programs that could enable Cricut owners to cut out designs and to use the machine without depending on its proprietary cartridges. In a comparative review of die-cutting machines, review site \"TopTenReviews\" identified being \"limited to cutting designs from a collection of cartridges\" as a major drawback of the Cricut range, though the review noted that it could be a preference for some.\n\nTwo programs which could formerly be used to make and then get Cricut machines to cut out arbitrary designs (using, for example, arbitrary TrueType fonts or SVG format graphics) were Make-the-Cut (MTC) and Craft Edge's Sure Cuts A Lot (SCAL). In April 2010 Provo Craft opened legal action against the publishers of Make-the-Cut, and in January 2011 it sued Craft Edge to stop the distribution of the SCAL program. In both cases the publishers settled with Provo Craft, and removed support for Cricut from their products. The programs continue to be usable with other home cutters.\n\nAccording to the text of its legal complaint against Craft Edge, \"Provo Craft uses various techniques to encrypt and obscure the USB communications between Cricut DesignStudio [a design program supplied with the hardware] and the Cricut e-cutter, in order to protect Provo Craft's proprietary software and firmware, and to prevent attempts to intercept the cutting commands\". Provo Craft contended that in order to understand and replicate this obscured protocol, Craft Edge had disassembled the DesignStudio program, contrary to the terms of its End User License Agreement, thereby (the company asserted) breaching copyright law. Provo Craft also asserted that Craft Edge were violating its trademark in the word \"Cricut\" by saying that its software could work with Cricut machines. Provo Craft asserted that this was likely \"to cause confusion, mistake or deception as to the source or origin of Defendant's goods or services, and [was] likely to falsely suggest a sponsorship, connection, license, or association of Defendant's goods and services with Provo Craft\".\n\nThe result of this is that customers with older versions of cricut machines that were 'force sunset' by discontinuation of software support have no alternative software to use with their now obsolete machines.\n\n"}

Digital medicines are designed to communicate to mobile and/or web-based applications that a patient has taken a specific dose of medication at a certain time. Because of the ingestible sensor component and association with prescription pharmaceuticals, products in this category require regulatory oversight and clinical validation.\n\nDigital medicine(s) aim to improve pharmaceutical therapy by improving patient adherence.\n\nDigital medicine is sometimes confused with similar disciplines, including the broader category of digital health, as well as digital therapeutics, another digital health subset. Digital health offerings use digital technologies to enhance human health in some capacity. Within this broader category, programs that include a prescription medication with an ingestible sensor component are considered digital medicines. By contrast, digital therapeutics are associated mainly with web-based health management tools and stand-alone health apps, generally without a prescription medication element.\n\nThe ingestible sensor component associated with digital medicines was originally approved in 2012 by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) through the Center for Devices and Radiological Health via a de novo pathway for novel, low-risk medical devices. This approval has been accompanied by FDA 510(k) clearances. The ingestible sensor is CE marked in Europe. A New Drug Application for the first fully integrated pharmaceutical with ingestible sensor component, Otsuka Pharmaceutical's ABILIFY MYCITE® (aripiprazole with Proteus ingestible sensor), was approved by the FDA in November 2017.\n\nWith its approval of the digital pill, the FDA confirmed that the review of digital medicines includes assessment of the ingestible device component, and that no additional safety and efficacy data is required for the original pharmaceutical.\n\nDigital medicines are being used for a variety of conditions in commercial and clinical settings. Medications with ingestible sensors are being prescribed in the treatment areas of hypertension, diabetes, hypercholesterolemia, heart failure, Hepatitis C, mental health, HIV, TB and organ transplantation.\n\nIn January 2016, Barton Health became the first institution to commercially offer digital medicines to patients with chronic medical conditions. In 2016, Children's Health in Dallas, Texas became the first to commercially use digital medicines with pediatric patients.\n\nBioethicists have expressed concerns around technologies that log and share information about patients’ medication-taking behavior. These concerns exist from the perspective of both individual and collective patient rights. However, proponents note that participation in digital medicine programs are voluntary, comply with all applicable laws and standards, and protect patient data in accordance with applicable state and federal privacy regulations, as with other data generated and stored in electronic medical records. Experts add that digital medicine programs show promise as a solution to medication adherence, and help physicians more accurately titrate dosages and determine how well the medication worked.\n"}

In humans, there are 23 chromosomes, but there are two sets of them, one from mother and one from father, totaling in 46, that are arranged according to their size, function and genes they carry. Each cell is supposed to have two of each, but sometimes due to mutations or malfunctions during cell division, mistakes are made that cause serious health problems. One such error is the cause of Distal trisomy 10q disorder. \n\nEach chromosome has two arms, labeled p (for petite, or short) and q (for long). If both arms are equal in length, the chromosome is said to be metacentric. If arms' lengths are unequal, chromosome is said to be submetacentric, and if p arm is so short that is hard to observe, but still present, then the chromosome is acrocentric. In Distal Trisomy 10q disorder, end or distal portion of the q (long) arm of the chromosome number 10 appears to be present three times, rather than two times as it is supposed to be. This extra arm results in chromosome 10 trisomy, meaning that three arms are present. Depending on the length of the aberrant arm, the severity can vary from case to case. Often the source of this chromosomal error is a translocation in one of the parents. Sometimes it occurs spontaneously, in which case it is termed \"de novo\".\n\nThis syndrome has a large range of outcomes depending on how much chromosomal material is involved. Outcomes include: very slow postnatal growth, hypotonia, lack of coordination skills and mild to severe cases of intellectual disability, digestive issues, and heart and kidney problems. Individuals with this disorder can also be distinguished by their facial features. Number of support groups do exist in the United States, where affected families can meet and discuss problems they encounter, possible treatments and can find emotional support.\n"}

The number of extant species is estimated at between six and ten million, found in nearly all environments, although only a small number of species occur in the oceans. This large extant means that the dietary habits of taxa include a large variety of behaviors.\n\nThe insect mouthparts consist of the maxilla, labium, and in some species the mandibles. The labrum is a simple fused sclerite, often called the upper lip, and moves longitudinally, which is hinged to the clypeus. The mandibles (jaws) are a highly sclerotized pair of structures that move at right angles to the body; used for biting, chewing and severing food. The maxillae are paired structures that can also move at right angles to the body and possess segmented palps. The labium (lower lip) is the fused structure that moves longitudinally and possesses a pair of segmented palps.\n\nThe mouthparts, along with the rest of the head, can be articulated in at least three different positions: prognathous, opisthognathous and hypognathous. In species with prognathous articulation, the head is positioned vertically aligned with the body, such as species of Formicidae; while in a hypognathous type, the head is aligned horizontally adjacent to the body. In an opisthognathous head, it was positioned diagonally, such as species of Blattodea and some Coleopterans. The mouthparts very greatly among insects of different orders but there are two main functional groups: mandibulate and haustellate. Haustellate mouthparts are those used for sucking liquids and can be further classified, by the presence of stylets, which include: piercing-sucking, sponging, and siphoning. The stylets are needle-like projections used to penetrate plant and animal tissue. The stylets and the feeding tube form the modified mandibles, maxilla, and hypopharynx.\n\n\nMouthparts that are mandibular are found in species of Odonata, Blattodea, adult Neuroptera, Coleoptera, Hymenoptera, Orthoptera, and Lepidoptera. However most adult Lepidoptera have siphoning mouthparts, while the larvae (commonly called caterpillars) are the ones with the mandibles.\n\n\"Drosophila melanogaster\" has a long history of use as a model organism for genetic studies. However, the quantitative analysis of feeding behavior remains \"challenging\" and it is \"often ignored or poorly characterized\". Among many methods, the most commonly applied are capillary feeder (CAFE), radioactive tracer labeling in food, dye tracer labeling in food and counting of proboscis extension (PE) events.\n\n"}

These older bureaus were established to assume enforcement responsibilities assigned to the Harrison Narcotics Tax Act, 1914 and the Narcotic Drugs Import and Export Act, 1922. (aka Jones-Miller Act)\n\nHarry J. Anslinger was appointed its first commissioner by Secretary of the Treasury Andrew Mellon under President Herbert Hoover. Under Anslinger, the bureau lobbied for harsh penalties for drug usage. The FBN is credited for criminalizing drugs such as cannabis with the Marijuana Tax Act of 1937, as well as strengthening the Harrison Narcotics Tax Act of 1914. Even so, the main focus of the FBN was fighting opium and heroin smuggling. One instance against opium was The Opium Poppy Control Act of 1942. To that end the FBN over time established several offices overseas in France, Italy, Turkey, Beirut, Thailand and other hotspots of international narcotics smuggling. These agents (never totaling more than 17) cooperated with local drug enforcement agencies in gathering intelligence on smugglers and also made undercover busts locally. The work against heroin and opium was however hamstrung by US foreign policy considerations: during the Vietnam War for instance great importance was placed on investigating minor Vietnamese smugglers that could be connected to the resistance while investigations of large scale smugglers from the US ally Thailand were left unfinished.\n\nAnslinger retired in 1962 and was succeeded by Henry Giordano, who was the commissioner of the FBN until it was merged in 1968 with the Bureau of Drug Abuse Control, an agency of the Food and Drug Administration, to form the Bureau of Narcotics and Dangerous Drugs, an agency of the United States Department of Justice. The BNDD was a predecessor agency of the current Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA).\n\n"}

In 1992, he became the first religious leader in Africa to publicly announce that he was HIV positive. In 2009, Byamugisha received the 26th annual Niwano Peace Prize \"in recognition of his work to uphold the dignity and human rights of people living with HIV/AIDS\".\n\nByamugisha co-founded the African Network of Religious Leaders Living with and Personally Affected HIV and Aids (ANERELA+) in February 2002, and in 2006 started a shelter for orphans of AIDS victims. He lives with his wife and three HIV negative children.\n\nByamugisha is from Kigezi, near the Ugandan border with Rwanda, the eldest of fourteen children. He was a history and geography teacher, as well as a deputy headmaster, before beginning his theology studies in his twenties. He was most interested in the philosophy of religion.\n\nIn 1990, Byamugisha's his first wife Kellen gave birth to his daughter, Patience, and both parents had been accepted to study at graduate programs in Britain. These plans changed when Kellen developed chest pains in April 1991, dying a week later. Six months later, Byamugisha learned that his wife had died of AIDS.\n\nByamugisha does not know where he contracted the virus. He and his wife were not tested before their marriage, and in 1988 he had been in a serious bicycling accident which required injections and a blood transfusion at a time when medical supplies and blood were not routinely screened for HIV.\n\nAlthough there was a possibility that he would lose his job because of the stigma associated with AIDS, Byamugisha decided to tell the principal of the college he worked at and other staff members about his condition. Although they were supportive of him, they asked him not to tell others. He began telling his students, and then other members of his church. He considers this to have been a risky choice, as community members often worried that this would harm the image of the church.\n\nByamugisha claims that he never felt guilty about his status. \"The only regret I have is that I lacked information. I have all this education—two degrees, one first class—but I failed a HIV test.\" However, in 1996 he fell ill and lost 40 pounds because he had no access to antiretroviral drugs (ARVs). Told that he would only live 6 months without ARVs, the bishop of Kampala used the church network to find two donors (an American and a Singaporean) who began sending him the drugs in 1997.\n\nAs he started to travel and speak about his condition, Byamugisha began encountering other religious leaders who were HIV infected, or personally affected by the death and illness of family members, but were not ready to publicly discuss their conditions. At the time, there was much misinformation about AIDS and HIV in Africa, and because of the promises and edicts from Christian, Muslim and Hindu groups on the continent, to have a religious leader infected or even affected personally was unthinkable.\n\nIn 1998, Byamugisha began to feel the need to organise the religious community with personal ties to HIV/AIDS. In 2002, he secured funds to host a meeting of the religious leaders who had come to him privately in the past, and 42 leaders met with him in the Collins Hotel, in Nyanga Hills, some 300 km outside Harare. Eight of the participants were HIV+, and this group later became the African Network of Religious Leaders Living with and Personally Affected HIV and Aids (ANERELA+), and grew to more than 2000 members in 39 countries by the end of 2006.\n\nByamugisha has become prominent in the international HIV/AIDS community. He has worked as an advisor to World Vision and has travelled internationally to speak about HIV/AIDS, including to a conference at the US White House in December 2002. Byamugisha advocates the view that HIV related issues reveal problems in other areas of society, such as poverty, literacy rates, social inequality, gender relations, trade, and government policy. Fixing these issues, he claims, will have a significant effect on the AIDS epidemic in Africa.\n\nMajor issues Byamugisha sees in charity organisations include their insistence on policies that match the domestic agendas of donor agencies rather than accept the realities of society in Africa. While the Catholic Church and other religious communities had softened their stance on condom usage and AIDS education in Africa, organisations such as the President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR), the biggest donor in Uganda, continued to insist on education about abstinence or delay of sexual debut for young people, and on fidelity or partner reduction for most adults, two interventions Byamugisha has been critical of as \"stigmatizing\" to those who cannot or will not abstain or be faithful to one partner. He also criticised PEPFAR's use of non-generic HIV drugs. In the first year of operation, PEPFAR insisted that only brand-name HIV drugs be used, though they are five times more expensive than the generic brands, and, Byamugisha pointed out, can only be used to treat five times fewer people. Byamugisha blamed the private agendas of the US pharmaceutical industry and the US evangelical Christian lobby for such policies which do not resonate with the realities of Africa.\n\nByamugisha also collaborated in 2003 with photographer Gideon Mendel on the book \"A Broken Landscape: HIV & AIDS in Africa\".\n\nByamugisha lives with his HIV positive wife Pamela (who runs a hardware store), with one HIV negative daughter from his previous marriage, Patience, and two HIV negative daughters, Love and Gift, whom he had with Pamela. The couple decided to have Love and Gift after drugs to prevent transmission of the virus from mother to child became available in 2000.\n\n\n"}

A health blog can grow in user size and operate as an online community.\n\nHealth blogs can be broadly categorized as either a personal journal type or an information site type of blog. There are a wide range of health blog sub-niches that include both journalistic and informative styles.\n\nThe most common sub-niches include:\nAll these categories can have sub-categories dedicated to specific concerns within their niche. Some health blogs do not fall under any of these categories; others could be classified under more than one.\n\nBlogs that only occasionally mention health are not categorised as health blogs, although they may be labeled by the author(s)/owner(s) as such.\n\nHealth blog users can be broadly categorized into authors and readers.\n\nStarted for different reasons, health blogs characterise owners' interest and objectives.\nUsually, the owner is the author who updates its content. The author determines the tone, language, frequency of posting, style of writing and other factors that determine the overall feel and look of the blog. More common authors of health blogs include medical professionals, patients and health enthusiasts.\n\nReaders broadly include all those who take time to read content posted on blogs, whether as a member or by chance. They include other professionals, patients and interested individuals. Readers make the audience of the blog and its authors. They directly or indirectly contribute to the health blog through commenting, emailing and such feedback techniques. Readers have been responsible of further disseminating health information by sharing it with their social circles.\n\nThe health care industry consists of health providers in diverse fields that include medicine, dentistry, nursing, allied health, assistive personnel and varied health practitioners. There is probably a health blog accounting information on each of these fields. Health blogs have offered a platform to stakeholders to channel developments, research and/or opinion. With each individual in these groups differently receiving, analysing and disseminating information, health promotion has been diversified and enhanced through personal blogs and websites.\n\nHealth blogs have transformed how health information is provided, analysed, presented and used. Blogging has improved the communication process, how the general public receives understands and reacts to health information.\nBlogs offer targeted users the possibility of easily accessing information real-time and capturing readers reactions through comments, emails and such. They influence, criticise, advice, sell and promote health literacy and related health concerns.\n\nIt is likely that health blogs will have a considerable long-term influence on the industry as the number of health blogs continue to increase.\n\nHealth blogs offer readers a platform to source answers, knowledge, opinion, support and/or guidance while managing their experience. They have brought together users of similar interest closer to finding whatever health information they seek. With a health blog being objective, specialising on a category of interest such as nutrition or weight control, it attracts readers of similar concerns, such as those who seek guidance, answers and such, to participate in the fulfilling their individual objectives and those of the blog.\n\nUnlike health-focused magazines and television shows, health blogs are able to be updated more frequently, keeping up to date with the new and up-and-coming health related concerns.\nThe content they publish is also far more personable and easier to access. Health blogs provide first hand information, as well as information based on real-life occurrences such as cancer or weight loss management, contributed by other users who have faced such predicaments.\nWhen this content is deemed trustworthy, it attracts and engages more readers in health matters.\n\nDepending on which niche a health blog specializes in, it serves as a health education platform, promoting health literacy to its users. Readers gain knowledge, insight, guidance and recommendations from health blogs. As people can share content with other members of community, health blogs promote community health. People refer others to blogs they deem helpful in accord to the going concern.\n\nThey are allowing ordinary people to partake in the larger health industry. Readers share their perspective, their experiences or just their passive thoughts on what the blog publishes. Usually blogs are created by individuals voicing their experiences, opinion and/or other personal interests. Readers offer their reaction to information posted on health blogs, directly or indirectly influencing the future of the health industry.\n\nBlogs are created for several objectives, often stipulated by its authors who usually double-up as its owners. An author could be an individual or an organisation and is expected to regularly update the blog. Content published on the blog can be to influence, criticise, inform, persuade or any other intent of communication. Unlike mainstream magazines and newspapers, which are constricted to what they write, blogs easily facilitate writing about anything that interests their authors, allowing for a more broad spectrum of focused health concerns.\n\nHealth blogs allow authors to publish content that is of general information contribution. Authors add their research, opinion and such to the larger wealth of health information.\n\nIt could be based on real-life experiences, where the author wants a platform to communicate with others of similar concerns. They give authors, especially of personal health blogs, a platform to voice personal experiences, share and help others with a chronology of health experiences.\nOther health blogs such as those associated with organisations or governments, pass information to the world about products and services, policies, discoveries and such. The blog acts as a contact point with the general public, communicating the intentions, such as marketing drugs, and/or opinion of the author. Authors have benefited from the viral spreading of content published within their target users. Health blogs have made it easier for contributory stakeholders to expend intent and/or necessary information to their target audience.\n\nHealth blogs have enabled health care stakeholders to create wealth. An author, individual or under organisation, can operate a health blog as an online business. An author, depending on granted administrative roles, can advertise and/or promote products and services for financial gains. Adverts, whether related to content published or not, can be a source of income for the author/administrator.\nWhere the health blog is owned or operated by a business organisation, it acts as the front-end user interface directing users to main or back-end sales pages.\nHealth businesses have been known to start blogs to enhance their product and/or service promotion.\nAn individual author can also do so, promoting self-created products and services or those of affiliates. Some health blogs can be classified as shopping blogs since they directly sell health content, products and services.\n\n"}

This means not only focusing on curative care but also on prevention of disease. The approach was developed by United Nations Children's Fund and the World Health Organization in 1995.\n\nAlthough the annual number of deaths among children less than 5 years old has decreased by almost a third since the 1970s, this reduction has not been evenly distributed throughout the world. According to the 1999 World Health Report, children in low- to middle-income countries are 10 times more likely to die before reaching age 5 than children living in the industrialized world. In 1998, more than 50 countries still had childhood mortality rates of over 100 per 1,000 live births.\n\nEvery year more than 10 million children in these countries die before they reach their fifth birthday. Seven in 10 of these deaths are due to acute respiratory infections (mostly pneumonia), diarrhea, measles, malaria, or malnutrition — and often to a combination of these conditions\n\nMany well-known prevention and treatment strategies have already proven effective for saving young lives. Childhood vaccinations have successfully reduced deaths due to measles. Oral rehydration therapy has contributed to a major reduction in diarrhea deaths. Effective antibiotics have saved millions of children with pneumonia. Prompt treatment of malaria has allowed more children to recover and lead healthy lives. Even modest improvements in breastfeeding practices have reduced childhood deaths. Many of these interventions have been summed up into 16 key family practices.\n\nWhile each of these interventions has shown great success, accumulating evidence suggests that a more integrated approach to managing sick children is needed to achieve better outcomes. Child health programmes need to move beyond single diseases to addressing the overall health and well-being of the child. Because many children present with overlapping signs and symptoms of diseases, a single diagnosis can be difficult, and may not be feasible or appropriate. This is especially true for first-level health facilities where examinations involve few instruments, little or no laboratory tests, and no X-ray.\n\nDuring the mid-1990s, the World Health Organization (WHO), in collaboration with UNICEF and many other agencies, institutions and individuals, responded to this challenge by developing a strategy known as the Integrated Management of Childhood Illness (IMCI). Although the major reason for developing the IMCI strategy stemmed from the needs of curative care, the strategy also addresses aspects of nutrition, immunization, and other important elements of disease prevention and health promotion. The objectives of the strategy are to reduce death and the frequency and severity of illness and disability, and to contribute to improved growth and development.\n\nThe IMCI clinical guidelines target children less than 5 years old — the age group that bears the highest burden of deaths from common childhood diseases.\n\nThe World Health Organization (WHO) also published the \" Integrated Management of Pregnancy and Childbirth (IMPAC)\" which included newborn and neonatal care guidelines as a continuum of care for both the mother and child in postnatal period.\n\n\n"}

James Esdaile, D.D. (1775–1854), a minister of the Church of Scotland, and Margaret Blair (1781–1843), he was born in Montrose, Angus, Scotland on 6 February 1808. He died in Sydenham, Kent on 10 January 1859.\n\nHe had three brothers, David Esdaile, D.D. (1811-1880) — an ordained cleric, who, along with James Esdaile (his brother), founded Edinburgh’s Ministers’ Daughters’ College (later known as Esdaile School), dedicated to the education of the daughters of Ministers of the Church of Scotland, and of Professors in the Universities of Scotland — John Esdaile (1813-1877) and Robert Esdaile (1816-1882), both of whom migrated to Canada, and one sister, Janet (1818-1819).\n\nHe married three times.\n\nHe studied medicine at the University of Edinburgh, graduating M.D. in 1829.\n\nIn 1830, he was appointed as \"Civil Assistant Surgeon\" to the East India Company, and arrived in Calcutta, Bengal (which was, then, the capital of British India), in 1831.\n\nHaving suffered from chronic bronchitis and asthma since his adolescence, Esdaile thought that India's different climate would be of benefit. Five years later, he suffered a total breakdown while working at Azamgarh, in Uttar Pradesh, and, later, was given an extended furlough from 1836 to 1838. During this time he travelled extensively; and his 1839 work, \"Letters from the Red Sea, Egypt, and the Continent\", was written as a result of these travels.\n\nHe returned from his furlough to Calcutta, and was soon appointed as \"Civil Surgeon\" to the small Hooghli Imambara Hospital; and, through this appointment, he was also responsible for the hospital at Hooghly Jail.\n\nFrom November 1839 to December 1841 Esdaile also served as the Principal of the prestigious Hooghly College, located in the palladian mansion in Chinsurah that had been originally designed and built for \"General Perron\". The College had been founded in August 1836 by the Bengali philanthropist Haji Muhammad Mohsin, and Esdaile replaced the College's original principal — another surgeon, Thomas Alexander Wise, M.D. (1802-1889) — who had been promoted to the position of Principal at the Dacca College.\n\nHe was serving as the \"Registrar of Deeds\" for Hooghly in 1843, and as Secretary of the Hooghly Branch of the Agricultural and Horticultural Society of India in 1843.\n\nHe was promoted to \"Presidency Surgeon\" in January 1848, and was further promoted to \"Marine Surgeon\" (serving the Indian Navy) on 29 May 1849.\n\nOn 4 April 1845, Esdaile performed his first mesmeric procedure:\n\nBy his own admission, Esdaile had never seen a mesmeric act; but, given the level of pain of this specific patient, and the understanding that he had gained from what he had read, it occurred to him that mesmerism might be of great value:\n\nEsdaile did succeed.\n\nAs performed by Esdaile, the mesmeric act was an exhausting procedure:\nAs a consequence, Esdaile, whose own health was far from good, soon began to delegate this exhausting work which, when necessary, would involve \"[having] a patient magnetized for hours each day for ten or twelve days [to his] native assistants, saving his own strength for the performance of surgery\".\n\nIn a short time, Esdaile had gained a wide reputation amongst the European and indigenous communities for painless surgery, especially in cases of the scrotal \"tumours\" that were endemic in Bengal at that time due to filariasis (similar to elephantiasis) that was transmitted by mosquitoes. Esdaile's mesmeric anaesthesia was extremely safe:\n\nHowever, despite the successes with anaesthesia and his impressive surgical outcomes (exclusively with \"native\" patients), Esdaile was at a loss to explain these events in the light of his earlier (pre-mesmeric) six years' experience:\n\nIn 1846, Esdaile's work with mesmerism-assisted painless surgery at Hoogly had come to the attention of the Deputy Governor of Bengal, Sir Herbert Maddocks. Maddocks appointed a committee of seven reputable (medical and non-medical) officials to investigate Esdaile's claims. They submitted a positive report (on 9 October 1846), and a small hospital in Calcutta was put at his disposal in November 1846.\n\nBy 1848, a mesmeric hospital supported entirely by public subscription was opened in Calcutta especially for Esdaile's work. It was closed 18 months later by the Deputy Governor of Bengal, Sir John Littler: according to Cotton (1931, p.170), although the Mott's Lane Mesmeric Hospital, opened in 1846, was permanently closed in 1848, Elliotson \"continued to practise mesmerism at the Sukeas' Street Dispensary until he left India in 1851\". \n\nIn 1848, Lord Dalhousie, the Governor-General of India, appointed Esdaile to the position of Presidency Surgeon; and, in 1849, whilst not supporting the continuation of the mesmeric hospital in Calcutta, Dalhousie had so much respect for Esdaile and his work, that he appointed him to the position of Marine Surgeon.\n\nEsdaile retired from the British East India Company in 1853, upon the expiration of his 20 years' contract. He became a Vic-President of the London Mesmeric Infirmary, and a Vice-President of the Scottish Curative Mesmeric Association (). After briefly returning to Perth in Scotland he settled in Sydenham where he died on 10 January 1859. He is buried at West Norwood Cemetery.\n\nEsdaile is thought by many to have been a pioneer in the use of hypnosis for surgical anaesthesia in the era immediately prior to James Young Simpson's discovery of chloroform. However, Esdaile had studied neither hypnotism nor Mesmerism himself.\n\nAlthough some would trace the practice of hypnotherapy back to Faria, Gassner, and Hell, it is conventional to trace what we now know as hypnotism back to the Scottish surgeon James Braid's reaction to a public exhibition of mesmeric techniques given by Charles Lafontaine in Manchester on 13 November 1841\n\nThere are some similarities between both the theory and practice of Victorian Mesmerism and hypnotism. Braid viewed the Bengal Government's report (i.e., Atkinson & O’Shaughnessy (1846)), on Esdaile's use of Mesmerism in an Indian hospital favourably, although only 30% of Esdaile's clients were entirely pain-free during their operations. Yet, Braid also expressed reservations about Esdaile's claims of supernatural powers possessed by certain subjects, and noted that Esdaile's operations were yet to be demonstrated in British hospitals on British patients.\n\nIn \"theory\" I entirely differ from Dr. Esdaile. He is a Mesmerist – that is, he believes in the transmission of some peculiar occult influence from the operator to the patient, as the cause of the subsequent phenomena. \n\nIn fact, as this report shows, Esdaile did not generally \"Mesmerise\" the patients himself but employed native Indian boys to spend 2–8 hours per day with each patient in a darkened room, employing a technique that involved breathing on the patient's body. The resemblance to the conventional techniques of Mesmerism is therefore minimal.\n\nEsdaile was a keen salmon fisherman, and it was \"at [his] instigation that the proprietors of salmon-fishings on the Tay constructed the artificial breeding beds at Stormontfield\" (Esdaile, 1857), when a letter, written by Esdaile, on the artificial propagation of salmon, \"A Plan for Replenishing the River Tay with Salmon\", was submitted to a meeting of the proprietors on the Tay on 19 July 1852.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "1657368", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1657368", "title": "Ketorolac", "text": "Ketorolac\n\nKetorolac, sold under the brand name Toradol among others, is a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) in the family of heterocyclic acetic acid derivatives, used as an analgesic. It is considered a first-generation NSAID.\nKetorolac acts by inhibiting the bodily synthesis of prostaglandins. Ketorolac in its oral (tablet or capsule) and intramuscular (injected) preparations is a racemic mixture of both (\"S\")-(−)-ketorolac, the active isomer, and (\"R\")-(+)-ketorolac.\nKetorolac was developed in 1989 by Syntex Corp. (now part of Roche). It was approved for medical use in the United States in 1989. The eye-drop formulation was approved by the FDA in 1992. An intranasal formulation was approved by the FDA in 2010 for short-term management of moderate to moderately severe pain requiring analgesia at the opioid level. As of 2015, the cost for a typical course of medication in the United States is less than US$25.\n\nKetorolac is used for short-term management of moderate to severe pain. It is usually not prescribed for longer than five days. Ketorolac is effective when administered with paracetamol to control pain in neonates because it does not depress respiration as do opioids. Ketorolac is also an adjuvant to opioid medications and improves pain relief. It is also used to treat dysmenorrhea. Ketorolac is used to treat idiopathic pericarditis, where it reduces inflammation.\n\nKetorolac is used for short-term pain control not lasting longer than five days, and can be administered orally, by intramuscular injection, intravenously, and by nasal spray. Ketorolac is initially administered by intramuscular injection or intravenously. Oral therapy is only used as a continuation from the intramuscular or intravenous starting point.\n\nKetorolac is used during eye surgery to maintain mydriasis, or the 'relaxing' of the iris muscles that will allow surgeons to perform cataract surgery. Ketorolac is effective in treating ocular itching. The ketorolac ophthalmic formulation is associated with a decreased development of macular edema after cataract surgery and is more effective alone rather than as an opioid/ketorolac combination treatment. Ketorolac has also been used to manage pain from corneal abrasions.\n\nDuring treatment with ketorolac, clinicians monitor for the manifestation of adverse effects and side effects. Lab tests, such as liver function tests, bleeding time, BUN, serum creatinine and electrolyte levels are often used and help to identify potential complications.\n\nKetorolac is contraindicated in those with hypersensitivity, allergies to the medication, cross-sensitivity to other NSAIDs, prior to surgery, history of peptic ulcer disease, gastrointestinal bleeding, alcohol intolerance, renal impairment, cerebrovascular bleeding, nasal polyps, angioedema, and asthma. Recommendations exist for cautious use of ketorolac in those who have experienced cardiovascular disease, myocardial infarction, stroke, heart failure, coagulation disorders, renal impairment, and hepatic impairment.\n\nThough uncommon, potentially fatal adverse effects are stroke, myocardial infarction, GI bleeding, Stevens-Johnson Syndrome, toxic epidermal necrolysis and anaphylaxis. A less serious and more common (>10%) side effect is drowsiness. Infrequent (<1%) side effects are paresthesia, prolonged bleeding time, injection site pain, purpura, sweating, abnormal thinking, increased production of tears, edema, pallor, dry mouth, abnormal taste, urinary frequency, increased liver enzymes, itching and others. Ketorolac can cause premature constriction of the ductus arteriosis in an infant during the third trimester of pregnancy. Platelet function is decreased related to the use of ketorolac.\n\nThe practice of restricting treatment with ketorolac is due to its potential to cause kidney damage.\n\nKetorolac can interact with other medications. Probenecid can increase the probability of having an adverse reaction or experiencing a side effect when taken with ketorolac. Pentoxifylline can increase the risk of bleeding. When aspirin is taken at the same time as ketorolac, the effectiveness is decreased. Problematic GI effects are additive and become more likely if potassium supplements, aspirin, other NSAIDS, corticosteroids, or alcohol is taken at the same time. The effectiveness of antihypertensives and diuretics can be lowered. The use of ketorolac can increase serum lithium levels to the point of toxicity. Toxicity to methotrexate is more likely if ketorolac is taken at the same time. The risk of bleeding increases with the concurrent medications clopidogrel, cefoperazone, valproic acid, cefotetan, eptifibatide, tirofiban, and copidine. Anticoagulants and thrombolytic medications also increase the likelihood of bleeding. Medications used to treat cancer can interact with ketorolac along with radiation therapy. The risk of toxicity to the kidneys increases when ketorolac is taken with cyclosporine.\n\nInteractions with ketorolac exist with some herbal supplements. \"Panax ginseng\", clove, ginger, arnica, feverfew, dong quai, chamomile, and \"Ginkgo biloba\", increases the risk of bleeding.\n\nThe primary mechanism of action responsible for ketorolac's anti-inflammatory, antipyretic and analgesic effects is the inhibition of prostaglandin synthesis by competitive blocking of the enzyme cyclooxygenase (COX). Ketorolac is a non-selective COX inhibitor. Ketorolac has been assessed to be a relatively higher risk NSAID when compared to aceclofenac, celecoxib, and ibuprofen.\n\nIn the US, ketorolac was the only widely available intravenous NSAID for many years; an IV form of paracetemol, which is not an NSAID, became available in Europe in 2009 and then in the US.\n\nThe Syntex company, of Palo Alto, California developed the ophthalmic solution Acular around 2006.\n\nIn 2007, there were concerns about the high incidence of reported side effects. This led to restriction in its dosage and maximum duration of use. In the UK, treatment was initiated only in a hospital, although this was not designed to exclude its use in prehospital care and mountain rescue settings. Dosing guidelines were published at that time.\n\nConcerns over the high incidence of reported side effects with ketorolac trometamol led to its withdrawal (apart from the ophthalmic formulation) in several countries, while in others its permitted dosage and maximum duration of treatment have been reduced. From 1990 to 1993, 97 reactions with a fatal outcome were reported worldwide.\n\n\n"}

He was the first to perform a non-direct blood transfusion using sodium citrate as an anticoagulant. The procedure took place in Rawson hospital in the city of Buenos Aires on November 9, 1914. Agote was the first to perform this procedure in the Americas. Agote worked independently and separately from the Belgian surgeon Albert Hustin, who discovered that sodium citrate in tolerable quantities could anticoagulate blood for transfusion on March 27, 1914.\n\nHe studied first in the Colegio Nacional de Buenos Aires, and then at the University of Buenos Aires, where he was also a teacher. He graduated as a doctor in 1893 with a thesis about suppurative hepatitis. He became Secretary of the National Department of Hygiene in 1894 and became head of the leper hospital in 1895 on the island of Martin Garcia. He was elected Congressman in 1910 and Senator in 1916 of the legislature in Argentina.\n\nThe first recorded blood transfusion was made between dogs by the English doctor Richard Lower around 1666. In 1667, French scientist Juan Bautista Denys transfused a human with animal blood. In 1900, Karl Landsteiner identified some of the blood substances responsible for the agglutination of red blood cells, identifying blood groups for the first time and some of their incompatibilities.\n\nDirect transfusions were still not practiced at the beginning of the 20th century because it was impossible to keep unaltered blood outside the body for later use. After 6–12 minutes, coagulation begins manifested initially by a gradual increase of viscosity that terminates with almost complete solidification. Coagulation is the defense of an organism to staunch wounds and minimize hemorrhages. Now we know that clotting is almost totally formed by platelets fastened by a network of filaments of fibrin.\n\nFibrin does not normally exist in blood and is created from protein plasma by the action of the thrombin enzyme. Similarly, thrombin is not naturally present in blood and is created by the precursor substance prothombrin, in a process that involves platelets, some exiting from calcium and substances produced by lesioned materials. Since clots are not created if there is a lack of some of these elements, the addition of sodium citrate (which eliminates calcium ions from blood) prevents its formation.\n\n"}
{"id": "13028883", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=13028883", "title": "Micromort", "text": "Micromort\n\nA micromort (from micro- and ) is a unit of risk defined as one-in-a-million chance of death. Micromorts can be used to measure riskiness of various day-to-day activities. A microprobability is a one-in-a million chance of some event; thus a micromort is the microprobability of death. The micromort concept was introduced by Ronald A. Howard who pioneered the modern practice of decision analysis.\n\nMicromorts for future activities can only be rough assessments as specific circumstances will always have an impact. However past historical rates of events can be used to provide a ball-park, average figure.\n\nActivities that increase the death risk by roughly one micromort, and their associated cause of death:\n\n\nIncrease in death risk for other activities on a per event basis:\n\nAn application of micromorts is measuring the value that humans place on risk: for example, one can consider the amount of money one would have to pay a person to get him or her to accept a one-in-a-million chance of death (or conversely the amount that someone might be willing to pay to avoid a one-in-a-million chance of death). When put thus, people claim a high number but when inferred from their day-to-day actions (e.g., how much they are willing to pay for safety features on cars) a typical value is around $50 (in 2009). However utility functions are often not linear, i.e. the more a person has already spent on their safety the less they are willing to spend to further increase their safety. Therefore, the $50 valuation should not be taken to mean that a human life (1 million micromorts) is valued at $50,000,000. Furthermore, the local linearity of any utility curve means that the micromort is useful for small incremental risks and rewards, not necessarily for large risks.\n\nGovernment agencies use a nominal Value of a Statistical Life (VSL) – or Value for Preventing a Fatality (VPF) – to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of expenditure on safeguards. For example, in the UK the VSL stands at £1.6 million for road improvements. Since road improvements have the effect of lowering the risk of large numbers of people by a small amount, the UK Department of Transport essentially prices a reduction of 1 Micromort at £1.60 (US$2.70). The US Department of Transportation uses a VSL of US$6.2 million, pricing a Micromort at US$6.20.\n\nMicromorts are best used to measure the size of \"acute\" risks, i.e. immediate deaths. Risks from lifestyle, exposure to air pollution and so on are \"chronic\" risks, in that they do not kill straight away, but reduce life expectancy. Ron Howard included such risks in his original 1979 work, for example an additional one micromort from …\n\nSuch risks are better expressed using the related concept of a microlife.\n\n\n"}

The results from this study helped reduce infant mortality and were instrumental in improving maternity services in the UK.\n\nThe origins of the NCDS can be found in the Perinatal Mortality Survey (PMS) which was then sponsored by the National Birthday Trust Fund and set up to collect information about the social and obstetric factors associated with stillbirth and death in early infancy.\n\nThe NCDS was first led by the paediatrician Neville Butler assisted by the National Birthday Trust Fund. The survey was initially planned as a one-off study to investigate the reasons for the relatively high rate of stillbirths (38.5 stillbirths per 1,000 births) in the UK compared to other developed countries. 98% of women (17,205) who gave birth in England, Scotland and Wales to 17,415 babies during the week of 3–9 March 1958 completed the survey. Records of birth deaths to 7,618 women and about 5,000 autopsy reports were also collected over the period of March-May 1958.\n\nIn 1963 the Plowden Committee which was investigating the education of primary children in the UK and the transition to secondary school, commissioned a follow-up report on the children from the NCDS. This follow-up survey was led by Mia Kellmer Pringle and attempts were made to trace all members of this birth generational cohort. The survey took place in 1965 and results were included in the Plowden report \"Children and their Primary Schools\" in 1967.\n\nBy 2016 the NCDS has been conducted in nine different sweeps to get information concerning the physical, educational and social development of the people from the initial survey: in 1965, 1969, 1974, 1981, 1991, 1999–2000, 2004, 2008 and 2014. The following sweep was planned for 2018. Examples of topics which have been included are medical care, health, home environment, educational progress, parental involvement, family relationships, economic activity, income, training and housing. During the period 2002–2004, genetic information on participants was also obtained to examine the genetic effects on common traits and diseases.\n\nFollowing the initial birth survey, the four subsequent sweeps were carried out by the National Children's Bureau. In 1985, the NCDS was moved to the Social Statistics Research Unit (SSRU), which in 2016 was known as the Centre for Longitudinal Studies (CLS).\n\nIn the 2013–2014 sweep data collection involved a sequential mixed mode approach whereby cohort members were invited to complete a web survey and those not responding were invited to participate via telephone. More than 9,100 cohort members took part in total, with 60% doing so on-line.\n\n, the results of the NCDS have been used in over 2,500 publications, some of which can be found here.

It campaigns for renationalisation of the privatised parts of the English National Health Service, reductions in outsourcing, and improvements to NHS funding, service provision and staffing. Despite focusing on health, the party has a range of policies in areas such as the economy, housing and education. These include opposition to austerity and a call for political reform.\n\nHaving stood candidates in local and European parliamentary elections in 2014, the party contested 12 seats in the 2015 general election. Surgical registrar Dr Alex Ashman was elected as the party's leader in December 2016 following the resignation of co-founder Clive Peedell earlier that year.\n\nThe passage of the Health and Social Care Act in March 2012 prompted the party's co-founder Clive Peedell, a cancer specialist doctor, to co-write an open letter to \"The Independent\" alongside esteemed medical signatories. The letter was highly critical of the Liberal Democrats for their role in the passage of the Act and stated that the signatories would \"form a coalition of healthcare professionals to take on coalition MPs at the next General Election, on the non-party, independent ticket of defending the NHS and acting in the wider public interest\". Two months later, on 14 May 2012, Peedell co-founded the NHA Party with retired doctor Richard Taylor, who had twice been elected as MP for Wyre Forest on an 'independent health' component to his local hospital party name. The party was launched in Westminster in November 2012.\n\nThe party first stood in the 2013 Eastleigh by-election, with candidate Dr Iain Maclennan taking 392 votes. The party went on to stand in the 2014 European Parliament elections and the 2015 General Election, taking over 20,000 votes in each. This placed the party seventh in the popular vote in England in the latter. The party's best result to date was the 7,211 votes taken by Dr Richard Taylor in Wyre Forest in 2015 (he had been the MP from 2001 to 2010 under the label Independent Kidderminster Hospital and Health Concern).\n\nParty co-founder Dr Clive Peedell resigned the leadership in July 2016, and Dr Paul Hobday was appointed as interim leader. Surgical registrar Dr Alex Ashman was elected as the new permanent party leader in December 2016 and promised to continue the work begun by Drs Peedell and Taylor.\n\nAs of December 2017 the party had 77,999 followers on Twitter and 27,675 on Facebook.\n\nBest-selling authors Mark Haddon and Philip Pullman, satirist Armando Iannucci, science writer Marcus Chown and comedian Rufus Hound. Hound stood as an NHA Party candidate in the London constituency for the 2014 European elections.\n\nThe party has a range of policies on healthcare, political reform, the economy, immigration, housing, education and environmental sustainability.\n\n\n\n\nThe party stood 12 candidates in the 2015 general election. Targeted seats included those of leading proponents of the Health and Social Care Bill such as David Cameron and Jeremy Hunt. The candidates were:\n\nAmong the twelve candidates, the party won no seats and only saved two deposits (\"i.e.\" won more than 5%). Their best result came in Wyre Forest, where Dr Taylor (who had previously won the seat twice for the Independent Kidderminster Hospital and Health Concern party) came 4th with 14.6% of the vote. Dr Irvine came 4th with 8.5% in South West Surrey.\n\nThe party stood five candidates at the 2017 general election. Food blogger and activist Jack Monroe was announced as the NHA Party candidate for Southend West, but withdrew due to ill health. The candidates standing were:\n\n\n"}

{"id": "147484", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=147484", "title": "Plant pathology", "text": "Plant pathology\n\nPlant pathology (also phytopathology) is the scientific study of diseases in plants caused by pathogens (infectious organisms) and environmental conditions (physiological factors). Organisms that cause infectious disease include fungi, oomycetes, bacteria, viruses, viroids, virus-like organisms, phytoplasmas, protozoa, nematodes and parasitic plants. Not included are ectoparasites like insects, mites, vertebrate, or other pests that affect plant health by consumption of plant tissues. Plant pathology also involves the study of pathogen identification, disease etiology, disease cycles, economic impact, plant disease epidemiology, plant disease resistance, how plant diseases affect humans and animals, pathosystem genetics, and management of plant diseases.\n\nControl of plant diseases is crucial to the reliable production of food, and it provides significant reductions in agricultural use of land, water, fuel and other inputs. Plants in both natural and cultivated populations carry inherent disease resistance, but there are numerous examples of devastating plant disease impacts such as Irish potato famine and chestnut blight, as well as recurrent severe plant diseases like rice blast, soybean cyst nematode, and citrus canker. However, disease control is reasonably successful for most crops. Disease control is achieved by use of plants that have been bred for good resistance to many diseases, and by plant cultivation approaches such as crop rotation, use of pathogen-free seed, appropriate planting date and plant density, control of field moisture, and pesticide use. Across large regions and many crop species, it is estimated that diseases typically reduce plant yields by 10% every year in more developed settings, but yield loss to diseases often exceeds 20% in less developed settings. Continuing advances in the science of plant pathology are needed to improve disease control, and to keep up with changes in disease pressure caused by the ongoing evolution and movement of plant pathogens and by changes in agricultural practices. Plant diseases cause major economic losses for farmers worldwide. The Food and Agriculture Organization estimates indeed that pests and diseases are responsible for about 25% of crop loss. To solve this issue, new methods are needed to detect diseases and pests early, such as novel sensors that detect plant odours and spectroscopy and biophotonics that are able to diagnose plant health and metabolism.\n\nMost phytopathogenic fungi belong to the Ascomycetes and the Basidiomycetes.\nThe fungi reproduce both sexually and asexually via the production of spores and other structures. Spores may be spread long distances by air or water, or they may be soilborne. Many soil inhabiting fungi are capable of living saprotrophically, carrying out the part of their life cycle in the soil. These are facultative saprotrophs.\nFungal diseases may be controlled through the use of fungicides and other agriculture practices. However, new races of fungi often evolve that are resistant to various fungicides.\nBiotrophic fungal pathogens colonize living plant tissue and obtain nutrients from living host cells. Necrotrophic fungal pathogens infect and kill host tissue and extract nutrients from the dead host cells. Significant fungal plant pathogens include:\n\n\n\nThe oomycetes are fungus-like organisms. They include some of the most destructive plant pathogens including the genus \"Phytophthora\", which includes the causal agents of potato late blight and sudden oak death. Particular species of oomycetes are responsible for root rot.\n\nDespite not being closely related to the fungi, the oomycetes have developed similar infection strategies. Oomycetes are capable of using effector proteins to turn off a plant's defenses in its infection process. Plant pathologists commonly group them with fungal pathogens.\n\nSignificant oomycete plant pathogens include:\n\nSome slime molds in Phytomyxea cause important diseases, including club root in cabbage and its relatives and powdery scab in potatoes. These are caused by species of \"Plasmodiophora\" and \"Spongospora\", respectively.\n\nMost bacteria that are associated with plants are actually saprotrophic and do no harm to the plant itself. However, a small number, around 100 known species, are able to cause disease. Bacterial diseases are much more prevalent in subtropical and tropical regions of the world.\n\nMost plant pathogenic bacteria are rod-shaped (bacilli). In order to be able to colonize the plant they have specific pathogenicity factors. Five main types of bacterial pathogenicity factors are known: uses of cell wall–degrading enzymes, toxins, effector proteins, phytohormones and exopolysaccharides.\n\nPathogens such as \"Erwinia\" species use cell wall–degrading enzymes to cause soft rot. \"Agrobacterium\" species change the level of auxins to cause tumours with phytohormones. Exopolysaccharides are produced by bacteria and block xylem vessels, often leading to the death of the plant.\n\nBacteria control the production of pathogenicity factors via quorum sensing.\nSignificant bacterial plant pathogens:\n\n\"Phytoplasma\" and \"Spiroplasma\" are genera of bacteria that lack cell walls and are related to the mycoplasmas, which are human pathogens. Together they are referred to as the mollicutes. They also tend to have smaller genomes than most other bacteria. They are normally transmitted by sap-sucking insects, being transferred into the plant's phloem where it reproduces.\n\nThere are many types of plant virus, and some are even asymptomatic. Under normal circumstances, plant viruses cause only a loss of crop yield. Therefore, it is not economically viable to try to control them, the exception being when they infect perennial species, such as fruit trees.\n\nMost plant viruses have small, single-stranded RNA genomes. However some plant viruses also have double stranded RNA or single or double stranded DNA genomes. These genomes may encode only three or four proteins: a replicase, a coat protein, a movement protein, in order to allow cell to cell movement through plasmodesmata, and sometimes a protein that allows transmission by a vector. Plant viruses can have several more proteins and employ many different molecular translation methods.\n\nPlant viruses are generally transmitted from plant to plant by a vector, but mechanical and seed transmission also occur. Vector transmission is often by an insect (for example, aphids), but some fungi, nematodes, and protozoa have been shown to be viral vectors. In many cases, the insect and virus are specific for virus transmission such as the beet leafhopper that transmits the curly top virus causing disease in several crop plants.\n\nNematodes are small, multicellular wormlike animals. Many live freely in the soil, but there are some species that parasitize plant roots. They are a problem in tropical and subtropical regions of the world, where they may infect crops. Potato cyst nematodes (\"Globodera pallida\" and \"G. rostochiensis\") are widely distributed in Europe and North and South America and cause worth of damage in Europe every year. Root knot nematodes have quite a large host range, they parasitize plant root systems and thus directly affect the uptake of water and nutrients needed for normal plant growth and reproduction, whereas cyst nematodes tend to be able to infect only a few species. Nematodes are able to cause radical changes in root cells in order to facilitate their lifestyle.\n\nThere are a few examples of plant diseases caused by protozoa (e.g., \"Phytomonas\", a kinetoplastid). They are transmitted as durable zoospores that may be able to survive in a resting state in the soil for many years. Further, they can transmit plant viruses. When the motile zoospores come into contact with a root hair they produce a plasmodium which invades the roots.\n\nSome colourless parasitic algae (e.g., \"Cephaleuros\") also cause plant diseases.\n\nParasitic plants such as mistletoe and dodder are included in the study of phytopathology. Dodder, for example, is used as a conduit either for the transmission of viruses or virus-like agents from a host plant to a plant that is not typically a host or for an agent that is not graft-transmissible.\n\n\nAbiotic disorders can be caused by natural processes such as drought, frost, snow and hail; flooding and poor drainage; nutrient deficiency; deposition of mineral salts such as sodium chloride and gypsum; windburn and breakage by storms; and wildfires. Similar disorders (usually classed as abiotic) can be caused by human intervention, resulting in soil compaction, pollution of air and soil, salinisation caused by irrigation and road salting, over-application of herbicides, clumsy handling (e.g. lawnmower damage to trees), and vandalism.\n\n\nPlant pathology has developed from antiquity, starting with Theophrastus, but scientific study began in the Early Modern period with the invention of the microscope, and developed in the 19th century.\n\n"}

{"id": "7743530", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=7743530", "title": "Prostitution in France", "text": "Prostitution in France\n\nProstitution in France (the exchange of sexual acts for money) was legal until April 2016, but several surrounding activities were illegal, like operating a brothel, living off the avails (pimping), and paying for sex with someone under the age of 18 (the age of consent for sex is 15).\n\nOn 6 April 2016, the French National Assembly voted to punish customers of prostitutes by a fine of €1500.\n\nIn the Napoleonic era, France became the model for the regulatory approach to prostitution. In the 20th century, however, a policy shift became apparent. Brothels became illegal in 1946, and France signed the Convention for the Suppression of the Traffic in Persons and of the Exploitation of the Prostitution of Others in 1960. France thus became a major supporter of the international abolitionist movement for the eradication of prostitution (see Abolitionism in France).\n\nThe history of prostitution in France is similar to that in other European countries, with alternating periods of tolerance and repression (\"Tolérance générale, répression occasionnelle\"), but is marked by the length of time during which the \"maisons\" (brothels) were tolerated. Prostitutes were not marginalized, but integrated into society where they had a role to play. In stories (which were often ribald), prostitutes would be complicit with other women in avenging men. The great Cathedral of Chartres had a window endowed by prostitutes (The Prodigal Son) in the same way as other windows were endowed by various other trade guilds (The Trade Windows).\n\nAfter the period of Roman rule, the Visigoth monarch Alaric II (485-507 AD) seems to be the first French ruler to prosecute prostitution.\n\nDuring the Middle Ages, the various authorities, civil or noble, oversaw prostitution as an institution. Regulation was largely at the municipal level, restricting activity on certain streets, travel, liaisons, required distinctive dress (gold belts, or \"ceinture dorée\")\nand opening hours of the \"maisons\" (10-6, or 10-8 in Paris).\n\nCharlemagne (768-814 AD) was amongst those rulers who attempted to suppress prostitution, declaring flogging (300 lashes) as a punishment in his capitularies. This was primarily aimed at the common man, since harems and concubines were common amongst the ruling classes. Some idea of the seriousness with which the state regarded the offense is provided by the fact that 300 lashes was the severest sentence prescribed by the Code Alaric. Offenders also had their hair cut off, and in the case of recidivism, could be sold as slaves. There is no evidence that any of this was effective.\nUnder Philip II (1180-1223) an irregular militia, the \"\" were created in 1189 to police prostitution and gambling, headed by a \"Roi des Ribauds\", but abolished by Philip IV (1285-1314) due to their licentiousness.\n\nIn the interim, Louis IX (1226-1270) attempted to ban prostitution in December 1254, with disastrous social consequences and widespread protests. The decree ordered the expulsion of all \"women of evil life\" from the kingdom and confiscation of their belongings, but simply drove the trade underground. Eventually he was forced to revoke this by 1256. Although still railing against women who were \"free with their bodies and other common harlots\", he acknowledged the pragmatic desirability of housing them away from respectable streets and religious establishments, and so obliged them to reside outside of the borders of the city walls. His resolve to do away with prostitution was affirmed in a letter of 1269 to the regents, as he set out on the Eighth Crusade, in which he refers to the need to extirpate the evil, root and branch. The punishment for infraction was an 8 sous fine and risking imprisonment in the Châtelet (see below). He designated nine streets in which prostitution would be allowed in Paris, three of them being in the sarcastically named Beaubourg quartier (Beautiful Neighbourhood) (Rue de la Huchette, Rue Froimon, Rue du Renard-Saint-Merri, Rue Taille pain, Rue Brisemiches, Rue Champ-Fleury, Rue Trace-putain, \nRue Gratte-cul, and the Rue Tire-Putain) (see below)\n\nToday, this area corresponds to the 1st-4th arrondissements clustered on the Rive Droite (right bank) of the Seine (see map). These streets, associated with prostitution, had very evocative if indelicate names including the \"Rue du Poil-au-con\" (or hair of the \"con\", from the Latin \"cunnus\" meaning female genitalia, hence Street of the Pubic Hair, or Poil du pubis), later altered to the Rue du Pélican, in the 1st arrondissement, near the first Porte Saint-Honoré, and the \"Rue Tire-Vit\" (Pull-Cock, i.e. penis, later the \"Rue Tire-Boudin\", Pull-Sausage) now Rue Marie-Stuart, in the 2nd arrondissement, near the first Porte Saint-Denis. It is said that \"Tire-Boudin\" was a euphemism invented for Mary Queen of Scots when she asked after its name, and the street is now named after her. The nearby \"Rue Gratte-Cul\" (Scratch-bottom) is now the Rue Dussoubs, and the \"Rue Pute-y-Musse\" (Whore [who] hides there) the Rue du Petit-Musc by corruption. The \"rue Trousse-Nonnain\" (fuck nun), later became Trace-Putain, Tasse-Nonnain, and Transnonain; then in 1851 it was amalgamated into the Rue Beaubourg. The \"Rue Baille-Hoë\" (Give Joy) is now Rue Taillepain in the 4th arondissement near the Porte Saint-Merri.\n\nIn 1358, the Grand Conseil of John II (1350-1364) echoing the \"necessary evil\" doctrine of Saints Augustine (354-430 AD) and Thomas Aquinas (1225-1274) declared that \"les pécheresses sont absolument nécessaires à la Terre\" (Sinners are an absolute necessity for the country). Prostitution remained confined to designated areas, as indicated in this decree in the reign of Charles V (1364-1380), by Hugh Aubriot, Provost of Paris in 1367, outlining the areas outside of which prostitutes would be punished 'according to the ordinance of Saint Louis';\n\"Que toutes les femmes prostituées, tenant bordel en la ville de Paris, allassent demeurer et tenir leurs bordels en places et lieux publics à ce ordonnés et accoutumés, selon l'ordonnance de Saint Louis. C'est à savoir : à L'Abreuvoir de Mascon (à l'angle du pont Saint-Michel et de la rue de la Huchette), en La Boucherie (voisine de la rue de la Huchette), rue Froidmentel, près du clos Brunel (à l'est du Collège de France aboutissant au carrefour du Puits-Certain), en Glatigny (rue nommée Val d'Amour dans la Cité), en la Court-Robert de Pris (rue du Renard-Saint-Merri), en Baille-Hoë (près de l'église Saint-Merri et communiquant avec la rue Taille-Pain et à la rue Brise-Miche), en Tyron (rue entre la rue Saint-Antoine et du roi de Sicile), en la rue Chapon (aboutissant rue du Temple) et en Champ-Flory (rue Champ-Fleury, près du Louvre). Si les femmes publiques, d'écris ensuite cette ordonnance, se permettent d'habiter des rues ou quartiers autres que ceux ci-dessus désignés, elles seront emprisonnées au Châtelet puis bannies de Paris. Et les sergents, pour salaire, prendront sur leurs biens huit sous parisis…\" \n\nContemporary accounts suggest that this decree was rarely enforced.\n\nThe appearance of syphilis at the end of the 15th century had stigmatized these houses by the end of the 16th century, but their continued existence was confirmed by King Henry IV (1589-1610).\n\nIn 1804 Napoleon ordered the registration and bi-weekly health inspection of all prostitutes. State controlled legal brothels (then known as \"\"maisons de tolérance\" or \"maisons closes\"\") started to appear in Paris and in other cities and became highly popular throughout the century. By 1810, Paris alone had 180 officially approved brothels.\n\nBy law, they had to be run by a woman (typically a former prostitute) and their external appearance had to be discreet. Prostitutes working in the \"maisons\", or any woman arrested twice for soliciting had to be registered as such. Registration involved having their name on a national register, and agreeing to abide by the regulations and twice weekly medical examinations.\nThis pattern of regulation rapidly spread throughout Europe, partly aided by the Napoleonic occupations.\n\nAmong the most expensive and best known \"maisons de tolérance\" in Paris were:\n\nMore sordid brothels, the \"maisons d'abattage\", offering quick and dirty \"services\", were popular amongst the lower-class.\n\nThe 19th century was also the time of several fabulously rich courtesans in Paris, with La Païva being the most famous one.\n\nDuring World War I, in Paris alone, US Army officials estimated that there were 40 major brothels, 5,000 professionally licensed streetwalkers, and another 70,000 unlicensed prostitutes. By 1917, there were at least 137 such establishments across 35 towns on or close to the Western front.\n\nThe British Army adopted local codes of ethics when fighting in another country, and so allowed troops on rest periods and days off to visit what became termed \"maisons tolérées\". Such activity was not just tolerated but encouraged for both the young, as well as the married men who were missing their wives. As the war advanced, so did the need and rank of the prostitutes entertained. While British troops paid just six pence per day were often found in the lowest priced institutes, dominion soldiers from Australia, New Zealand, and Canada received six shillings and could afford higher-class \"services\". British officers preferred to \"always indulge with armour (condoms)\" and took to patronizing German Army officers' former prostitutes when the lines of conflict were advancing towards the end of the war, with the advantage that they sometimes gained tactical and strategic information as well.\n\nIt is unknown how many or what percentage of men visited the institutions, but the French army recorded over a million cases of gonorrhea and syphilis during the war. In 1915, in Le Havre, a survey undertaken by the Royal Army Medical Corps counted 171,000 uniformed British Army visitors to the brothels in just one street. As a result, rates of venereal disease began to climb, with 23,000 British Army men at any time on average during the second half of the campaign hospitalized for treatment, with over 150,000 British soldiers having been infected by the end of the war. The disease at the time had a high social stigma, but a particularly bad infection could get a soldier medically discharged from frontline duty, even on a temporary basis. Syphilis was treated with injections of mercury, administered at a hospital over a 30-day period, thereby guaranteeing escape from the frontline. The result was that some prostitutes with particularly bad VD infections could charge more. Every British army unit had a sexually transmitted disease clinic, where soldiers could gain an ointment consisting of mercury and chlorine to prevent VD infection, or receive a urethral irrigation with potassium permanganate after STI exposure.\n\nThe US Army attitude was different, driven by a reformist attitude at home. In October 1917, Secretary of War Newton D. Baker said:\n\nAided by the American Social Hygiene Organization, he closed so called segregated zones close to Army training camps, which included closing the notorious Storyville district in New Orleans. When the two million soldiers of the American Expeditionary Force had been deployed to France, they were guided by a bulletin from AEF commander Gen. John Pershing to just say no:\n\nThis was backed up by additional posters and pamphlets that read \"You wouldn't use another fellow's tooth-brush, so why use his whore?\" and \"A Soldier Who Gets a Dose Is a Traitor!\" The US Army had clear instructions on those who did not follow the no indulgence rule. US Army regulations required soldiers who admitted to having sex while on leave to submit to chemical prophylaxis, that included irrigating the penis. Soldiers who did not report for prophylaxis and later contracted VD were subject to court-martial and possibly a hard-labor sentence, while those who contracted disease after treatment only lost pay during treatment. Implemented from the first day of training, the initiative was so successful that US Army doctors reported that 96% of the cases they treated had been contracted while the soldier was still a civilian.\n\nHowever, on debarkation at the designated port of St. Nazaire, a dispute with French authorities broke out, after the AEF placed the \"Maisons Tolérée\" off limits. With the dispute escalating, President Georges Clemenceau sent a memo to Gen. Pershing offering a compromise: American medical authorities would control designated brothels operated solely for American soldiers. Pershing passed the proposal to Raymond Fosdick, who on giving it to Secretary Baker responded: \"For God's sake, Raymond, don't show this to the president or he'll stop the war.\" The French later proposed a deal that targeted the Black American troops, most of whom were assigned to unloading freight in segregated stevedore battalions, again flatly turned down by US authorities. But this merely highlighted US differential racial policy, as all black troops were required by US Army regulations to undertake prophylaxis when returning from leave, whether or not they acknowledged sexual contact.\n\nThe policy adopted by the US Army worked, with far lower rates of VD across their troops compared to French or British and Dominion combatants. However, after the signing of the Armistice, when the US Army could no longer plead military necessity as grounds for curtailing leave, VD rates among US Army troops shot up.\n\nDuring World War II, Dr Edith Sumerskill raised the issue of \"Maisons Tolérées\" in Parliament to Secretary of State for War Anthony Eden after the intervention of the British Expeditionary Force. Further questions were raised in Parliament after the D-Day invasion, to ensure such local practises and medical precautions were continued.\n\nDuring the German occupation of France, twenty top Paris \"maisons\", including le Chabanais, le Sphinx and le One-Two-Two, were reserved by the Wehrmacht for German officers and collaborating Frenchmen.\nThe brothels flourished during this time, and Hermann Göring visited \"Le Chabanais\", as is related in the 2009 two-volume book \"1940-1945 Années Erotiques\" by Patrick Buisson.\n\nAfter the war, Marthe Richard, a town councillor in Paris and former street prostitute, successfully campaigned for the closure of all \"maisons\". On 13 April 1946, the \"loi de Marthe Richard\" was passed with votes of the Christian-Democratic Party (MRP) and the Communist Party (PCF). The latter considered brothels to be \"bourgeois\". As a result, the legal brothels were closed. (This serves as a plot point in the first James Bond novel, \"Casino Royale\".) However, prostitution remained a legal activity, with only its organization and \"exploitation\" (pimping) forbidden.\n\nThis ended a system in existence since 1804, which effectively made prostitutes less visible without suppressing the trade, and thus preservied \"public morality\". Prostitute registries were supposed to be destroyed, but police kept files till 1960. Roughly 20,000 women were affected by this law, and approximately 1,400 houses were closed. Many former brothel owners soon opened \"hôtels de passe\" instead, where prostitutes could keep on working, but the visibility of their activities was reduced.\n\nCritics of French prostitution policy, such as Mouvement du Nid, question how effective this was, its implementation, and whether it really closed the \"maisons\". For instance, they point to the presence of military brothels in Algeria till 1960.\n\nIn 1958, the \"Office central pour la répression de la traite des êtres humains\" (OCRTEH) was created as a branch of the police, to combat pimping and cooperate with Interpol. It is under the direction of the Minister of the Interior.\n\nFrance became officially \"abolitionist\" in 1960 when it ratified the 1949 UN Convention on the Suppression of Trafficking and the Exploitation of Prostitution.\n\nIn the debates over prostitution in France, \"abolition\" was used to refer to both the abolition of laws and regulations that make any distinction between someone involved in prostitution and the general population, and the abolition of prostitution itself. At that time, police files on prostitutes were finally destroyed.\nHowever, implementation varied considerably locally, although prostitution was rarely on the political agenda over the next 30 years. Exceptions were the demonstrations of prostitutes rights movements against police harassment in 1975, and periodic calls by individual politicians for re-opening the \"maisons\" (see \"Maisons closes\" below).\nThese included that of (RPR), a former Minister of health (1986-1988) in 1990, as a public health measure, given the concerns about HIV/AIDS.\n\nState policy has been built on two principles - criminalization, and support. Criminalization of the exploitation (brothels, procuring, pimping) of prostitution, and support and re-integration for those exiting. However, the latter attracted few funds, and was largely left to charitable NGOs. Only a single position within the Department of Social Services had responsibility for this part of policy and funding.\nThe original intention was that the Departments would set up their own Prevention and Rehabilitation Services, but of 100, only 12 were created following the 1960 ordinance, and by 1999, there were only 5, run by NGOs.\nOther state responsibilities have fallen to the women's rights administration,\nand also to health, finance, interior, foreign, and education ministries from time to time.\n\nIn the new Penal Code, pimping became a serious offence if associated with organized crime or barbarity, and overall was defined at three levels of severity with increasing fines, and prison sentences from five years up to life imprisonment. Clients were only criminalized if purchasing from minors under 15 years of age.\n\nIn 1998, sex tourism was added if offences against minors were committed by French residents outside France.\n\nIn the 1990s, France became increasingly assertive internationally as a champion of abolitionism, opposing moves towards liberalization and regulation by the Netherlands and the International Labour Organization.\nFrance also opposed the distinction between 'free' and 'forced' prostitution in international discussions. Hubert Védrine the foreign minister asserted France's position at various international venues, such as the protocol to the Convention on the Rights of the Child on the sale and prostitution of children and child pornography (2000) and the Convention on organized crime with the protocol on trafficking (Palermo 2000). French policy emphasised, along with the International Convention, that the real evil was prostitution, not trafficking, defined as an \"accompanying evil\". At the same time, Nicole Péry, minister for women's rights (\"Secrétaire d'État aux droits des femmes\"; 1998-2002), included prostitution in her department's campaign on violence against women, calling it a form of violence at Beijing+5, (New York 2000).\n\nActive solicitation was also outlawed in the late 1940s. Passive solicitation (being present with revealing clothes at locations known for prostitution) was outlawed in 2003 as part of a package of law-and-order measures by then-interior minister, Nicolas Sarkozy, in his \"Domestic Security Bill\" (loi pour la sécurité intérieure 2003, or LSI also known as Loi Sarkozy II), and had the effect of reducing the visibility of prostitution on the streets.\nProstitutes' organizations decried the measure, which came into force in March 2003, calling it punitive and fated to increase the power of pimps. Many prostitutes started to work out of vans, a strategy authorities attempted to combat by using parking regulation enforcement.\n\nLaw number 2016-444 \"visant à renforcer la lutte contre le système prostitutionnel et à accompagner les personnes prostituées\" (\"Eng.: \"to strengthen the fight against the prostitution system and to support prostituted persons\"\") was enacted on 6 April 2016, with effect from 13 April 2016.\n\nThe most publicised provision of this law is that the buying of sexual acts was made illegal and punishable with a fine of up to €3,750. However, the bulk of this law is concerned with supporting prostitutes exiting the industry and supporting victims of sex trafficking.\n\nIn the first six months after the law was enacted, 249 men were prosecuted for purchasing sexual acts.\n\nIt is legal for a man or woman to be a prostitute and sell sexual acts. The buying of sexual acts was outlawed in April 2016.\n\"Racolage\" (soliciting), including \"racolage passif\" (passive soliciting) is prohibited. This is defined as standing in a public place known for prostitution, dressed in revealing attire, and is punishable by up to six months in prison and a fine of €3750.\nOwning or operating a brothel is illegal.\n\nAll forms of \"proxénétisme\" (procuring) are illegal. \n\"Proxénétisme\" is defined as:\n\nFrance is an \"abolitionist\" country - its public policy is the prohibition and eradication of prostitution; however, at the same time, it considers that making it illegal to offer sexual acts in return for goods or services in the context of one's private life is a violation of individual liberty.\n\nThe issue has been prominent on the French political agenda since the late 1990s, responding to international pressures on child prostitution and pornography and trafficking, international distinctions between forced and voluntary entry into prostitution (rejected by the dominant \"abolitionist\" discourse) and increasing migration. This has been accompanied by increasing discourse on \"la sécurité\" internally, which has gradually become dominant, affecting the framework in which prostitution is debated. This was heightened in 2002 when Jean-Pierre Raffarin's right-wing government (2002-2005) succeeded the \"Gauche Plurielle\" (plural left) coalition of Lionel Jospin (1997-2002). The Jospin construction was that prostitutes were victims and needed to be saved and re-integrated. This was a view shared by state feminists, ministers, delegates, and the powerful abolitionist lobby, and is reflected in the Derycke report as well as the National Commission on Violence Against Women, \nas well as the debates on modern slavery (\"esclavage moderne\").\nThese consultations in turn enabled agents of the civil society access to the policy process. Very few of these constructed prostitution as a legitimate form of work.\n\nAt the municipal level, there was evidence of prostitutes being constructed as public nuisances that needed to be confined, and many mayors of both political groups responded to citizen groups to introduce by-laws restricting prostitutes' activities in early 2002. This was fuelled by an apparent increased visibility. For instance, Françoise de Panafieu (UMP delegate 17th arondissement) campaigned against street prostitution in the summer of 2002. The commitment to abolitionism prevented specific laws aimed at prostitution (which would have been seen as regulation) initially, so they often used traffic and parking by-laws to drive out workers, which ultimately mean that they were moved from well-lit busy areas to much more unsafe areas. As the discourse shifted from abolitionism to security, so did more explicit laws and regulations. This disquiet enabled Nicolas Sarkozy to later mobilize public anxiety about security evident in the elections that year in his Domestic Security bill.\n\nThe cultural context is the concept of gender equality as stated in the preamble to the 1946 and 1958 constitution and which had seen an increasing momentum of political gains for women, including the establishment of a women's policy agency in 1974 and a ministry of women's rights in 1981. However, a significant gap still exists in terms of economic and employment opportunities. Meanwhile, immigration policies have become increasingly restrictive, and soliciting can result in the removal of a migrant's work permit.\n\nThe 2007 Socialist Party Manifesto calls for holding clients \"responsible\". The vague language is due to the fact that such measures remain controversial in the Socialist Party.\nThe Manifesto also calls for repealing the ban on \"passive solicitation\".\n\nIn 2010, Chantal Brunel, an MP in Sarkozy's ruling right-wing UMP party, and newly appointed head of the equality office, \ncalled for legalizing and regulating \"maisons closes\" (brothels), (see Maisons closes, below) akin to the situation in several surrounding countries, claiming that this would make the sex trade safer and transparent. She outlined the strategy in her 2010 book \"Pour en finir avec les violences faites aux femmes\" (\"An end to violence against women\"). This caused considerable discussion. French prostitutes are opposed to this plan to legalize and regulate \"maisons\", arguing that it would limit their options to make their own decisions—dozens of French prostitutes have marched to protest the proposal to legalize brothels. Instead, they demand the repeal of the 2003 law outlawing solication,\na demand that Chantal Brunel also supports.\n\nIn June 2012, the socialist women's minister Najat Vallaud-Belkacem announced that she wanted to abolish prostitution in France and in Europe.\n\nState feminists dominated the discourse in the left-wing Jospin years, pursuing an anti-male-violence campaign. As Women's Minister, Nicole Péry, confirmed in her New York speech (see above), prostitution, as a form of male violence, was very much part of that State strategy.\n\nThis influence has waned under the security agenda of the succeeding right-wing governments, but is still evident in the new political thinking, as stated in Marie-Jo Zimmermann's (UMP) 2002 report to the Delegation on Women's Rights on prostitution\nin which she echoes the left wing sentiment that the purchase of sex constitutes violence. The pervasiveness of this thinking is even found in the budget.\n\nAs in many other countries, debates on the nature and regulation of transactional sex are highly polarized. These positions are the familiar ones that define sex work as violence against women on the one hand, and those who see the problem as stigmatisation and poor working conditions on the other. These result in proposals for either the eradication of prostitution, or social reforms. The dominant abolitionist faction consists of Catholics, family values advocates and sections within feminism and the left. As elsewhere, the term \"abolitionism\" has seen a shift from the abolition of Réglementation to include abolition of sexual slavery.\n\nFrom the abolition of \"Réglementation\" and the \"maisons closes\" (1946) to the late 1990s, there was a broad abolitionist consensus. This resulted from a close fit between the government position and the dominant socio-political discourse, making it acceptable to a broad coalition that included abolitionists, secular and religious NGOs, politicians from both ends of the political spectrum, and most French feminists. This was so dominant under the Jospin years as to appear normative and non-ideological\nand above any philosophical debate.\nThis provides abolitionists access to both the policy process and to resources, such as the 2000 UNESCO conference (see below), which had high-profile support, including important left-wing figures such as Jean-Pierre Chevènement and Sylviane Agacinski, who was also married to Lionel Jospin.\n\nIn the 1990s, a number of changes shifted the focus of debates. These included an increasing globalization of movements on both parts of the debate, Sweden and the Netherlands were moving to change their legislation in two distinct and different directions, there was political instability in Eastern Europe and there was also increasing concern about AIDS, while state feminists were also playing an increasing part in policy debates. There were however occasional dissenting voices such as the debate in Le Nouvel Observateur in 1999, sparked by the Dutch legislation.\n\nA manifestation of abolitionism was the declaration of May 18, 2000, published in the centre-left \"Le Nouvel Observateur\", called \"Le corps n'est pas une marchandise\" (\"The body is not a commodity\"). This was signed by 35 prominent citizens, and demanded that France and Europe affirm their commitment to the abolition of prostitution, resulting in a debate covering many aspects of the subject, such as choice, autonomy, voice, and agency. Signatories included Francois Hollande, Robert Hue, Dominique Voynet, Isabelle Alonso, Boris Cyrulnik, Françoise Héritier, and Antoinette Fouque.\nThat same week, the Minister of Labour, Martine Aubry, proclaimed in the Assemblée nationale that France would continue to defend its abolitionist position against prostitution, because the commodification of human bodies was not acceptable and a violation of human rights.\n\nUNESCO held a conference in Paris on May 16 of that year (\"Peuple de l'Abîme. La Prostitution aujourd'hui\")\norganized by (Fondation Scelles),\nan abolitionist NGO, which also published \"Le livre noir de la prostitution\", a strongly worded attack on the subject of prostitution.\n\nIn 1999, 189 cases of pimping were tried, and 137 sentenced to prison. Generally the judiciary were satisfied with the existing legislation,\nalthough 2000 also saw the creation of a new unit of the Judicial Police using information technology to combat pimping and trafficking. Transnational operators proved a problem to the police.\n\nState feminism culminated in the Senate's new \"Délégation Aux Droits Des Femmes\" (Delegation for Women's Rights)\ninitiating an inquiry in 1999. The 2001 report of the Delegation (named after its author, Senator Dinah Derycke (1997-2001))\nwas critical of what it saw as the lack of commitment in the fight against prostitution, mainly the difference between France's official abolitionist position and what was occurring in practice. Although the report received a favourable reception in parliament initially, its political impact was limited. Senator Derycke retired due to ill health and died soon after, while other pressures diverted the debate into other related measures, such as organized crime and trafficking and 'modern slavery'. Outside parliament, there was a new activism and demand for action, led by \"Bus des femmes\".\nBut the focus of the outcry was trafficking, with an emphasis on Eastern Europe. However, the new right-wing government elected in 2002 (Jean-Pierre Raffarin) was to completely change the way prostitution was perceived (see below).\n\nCriticism of the dominant discourse came from prostitute' rights advocates, health associations, such as Cabiria (Lyons),\nAIDS groups, and some activists who complained that sex workers were being treated paternalistically and denied voice and moral agency. They demanded eradication of stigma and restoration of rights, access to health and social services, and better \"working conditions\". Organizations such as Cabiria, ,\n, and AIDES-Paris Isle-de-France condemned the UNESCO conference (above) as stigmatizing.\n\nAll parties claimed they spoke on behalf of and for sex workers, and shared a concern for their welfare, while denying their opponents did.\nTherefore, both sides held a position that workers should not be penalized, positioned as either victims or legitimate workers.\n\nNew issues arising in 2002 were local residents' complaints and the ascendacy of a law and order discourse on both left and right, leading to a heated debate, notably the suggestion by Françoise de Panafieu (UMP) that the (see Maisons closes below) be re-opened.\nThe issue of \"security\" became a major issue in the presidential and parliamentary elections of 2002. The catch-cry of \"to save the Republic\" worked in the favour of the right and President Jacques Chirac and Jean-Pierre Raffarin who came to power as Prime Minister that year.\nNicolas Sarkozy became minister of the interior in the incoming right-wing Rafferin government (2002-2005), almost immediately announcing a \"Domestic Security Bill\" (),\nand the focus of the debates around prostitution shifted to legislation. (see Public opinion 2002, below)\n\nIn justifying these measures, Sarkozy claimed large segments of the population were exposed to \"anxiety and legitimate exasperation\". Article 42 addressed the protection of women in prostitution, considered victims of exploitation, and these were amplified by the Minister for Equality in the Workplace, Nicole Ameline (2002-2004). \nSarkozy stated that by criminalizing passive soliciting, he was protecting prostitutes and helping them escape organized crime.\nThe Government position was that action against certain activities would improve the quality of life and sense of security of the poor, who are likely to be victims of crime. Sarkozy stated that the poor supported a tough crime agenda and that the general population wanted a stronger stand on law and order. In particular, he cited an Ipsos poll suggesting that 80% of people on minimum wage approved of his proposals and that the lower the socio-economic class the more support.\nIn February 2002, a poll suggested security was the most important issue on people's minds in an election year, and in October, 70% of the population considered the proposed measures necessary.\n\nThe Sarkozy bill both redefined prostitution and transformed policy, making solicitation, previously a minor offence, a serious offence (un délit) (up to six months imprisonment initially, but amended to two), with stiffer fines, and brought back \"passive\" solicitation as a crime (Article 50). Passive solicitation had been previously decriminalized by another right-wing government, that of Balladur in 1994.\n\nProposed Article 225-10-1 removed the necessity of the police having evidence of soliciting, allowing 'dress or posture' to be sufficient. He explained that it was inconvenient for the police to have to obtain evidence of active soliciting. In the Senate, a Government amendment subsequently deleted reference to dress after a popular outcry.\nArticle 50 also criminalized purchase of sex from those considered 'particularly vulnerable', such as 'illness, disability, physical or mental deficiency or pregnancy'.\n\nFurthermore, the new legislation allowed for foreigners to have their permits revoked for disturbing public order, allowing deportation to become a penalty for solicitation (active or passive), even if they were legal immigrants. It addressed trafficking, by defining it and attached penalties. In the case of alleged victims of trafficking, collaboration allowed them to stay and work till their case was heard. If an exploiters were convicted (Article 76), they could then receive permanent residence. Finally, article 52 allowed for annual reports to be published on prostitution in France, from 2004 onwards.\n\nReactions included demonstrations and petitions.\nCriticism came from the left, trade unions, women's\nand human rights and poverty groups who saw this bill, which simultaneously addressed begging, squatting and assembling in public areas of buildings,\nas an attack on the poor, stating that no one chooses to be a beggar or a prostitute.\nSarkozy was accused of exploiting people's insecurities. In the Senate, the measures were seen to be street cleaning, rather than addressing the causes of social problems and social exclusion, and that reconstructing prostitution as a law and order issue would merely drive it underground, depriving sex workers from access to services, and damaging AIDS campaigns. it was stated that no-one chooses to be a beggar or a prostitute, to live in neighbourhoods with no facilities and no public services\". It was noted that there was no action to deal with organized crime or those who might be exploiting sex workers.\n\nThe issue of passive solicitation caused particular concern since it could mean that any woman could be arrested for the way she dressed, and it was particularly hard to define. The judiciary were equally unhappy with evidence that solely consisted of police testimony and were reluctant to convict.\nIt was suggested that concern for victims for trafficking was hardly consistent with punishing them, and that prostitution had become conflated with trafficking. The trafficking policy seemed more aimed at the porousness of borders than at actual criminals, while migrant sex workers appeared to be particularly discriminated against, since they were simultaneously 'rescued' and deported without in any way addressing their vulnerability. Calls for aiming trafficking policy at traffickers rather than sex workers came from the Senate Law Commission, the Delegations for Women's Rights in the Senate and National Assembly, as well as from the opposition.\n\nIn the Senate hearings into prostitution that year, Claude Boucher of \"Bus des Femmes\", a sex worker support group, described how sex workers sell sex to survive, unable to make ends meet on social security or the minimum wage. To treat them as criminals, she argued, would just make them more vulnerable. \"Cette loi n'est même pas une loi d'ordre moral, c'est une loi contre les exclus, contre les plus vulnérables\" (This law is not even a public morals law, it is a law against those who are excluded, against the most vulnerable)\n\nSarkozy did not attempt to produce a comprehensive policy on prostitution, but rather a quick fix, addressing immediate concerns of voters in terms of visibility.\nIn this, he succeeded, at least in the short term. The police reported a 40% decrease in prevalence, but also that it had moved to more discreet areas and hours.\nHowever, the more profound effect was that Sarkozy had changed the framing of sex workers from victims to criminals, and tied it to immigration debates, focusing narrowly on street transactions. This avoided inconveniencing the middle-class clients, who might have created more opposition. The governmental policy tended to portray all immigrant women in prostitution, the most vulnerable, as victims of trafficking and exploitation, and their pimps as \"foreigners\".\n\nFollowing the law coming into effect, 5,619 charges of passive solicitation were laid between March 2003 and July 2004, 90% of these were women, and most from Bulgaria and Albania (40%), Nigeria, Sierra Leone, and Cameroon (35%). 15% were French nationals, another 10% from other areas in Africa and 2% from Asia. \nThere was a notable increase in foreign workers detained and deported. In 2004, the police dismantled many trafficking networks, mainly involving Eastern Europe and Africa.\n\nWhile the law referred to protection, shelter, and re-integration, there was no provision made for this, according to Cimade, an NGO.\nThe results of the law were considered disastrous for the women who were supposed to be protected. The effects were largely those of displacement, pushing their activities into isolated areas, and the 3-7am timeslot, isolated them from service agencies, exposed them to violence and destroyed the historical working relationship with the police.\nA study by Anne Hidalgo and Christophe Caresche, Deputy mayors in the office of the Mayor of Paris (Bertrand Delanoë),\nwas especially critical:\n\n«\"En amalgamant prostitution libre et prostitution forcée, qui relèvent de processus totalement différents, en victimisant les personnes qui se prostituent, sans distinction, cette loi légitime et renforce les violences symboliques, physiques, policières, institutionnelles. Elle renforce aussi leur insécurité, les obligeant à investir des lieux éloignés des regards, d'autant plus qu'elle les contraint à travailler davantage puisque toutes ont vu leur clientèle se raréfier, et par conséquent leur revenu diminuer de 50 % en moyenne\"»\n\nSarkozy had made a sharp distinction between the \"classic prostitution\" of the traditional French Fille de Joie, who he depicted as unproblematic, even a cultural icon (see Culture), and the presence of \"ces malheureuses filles étrangères\" (these poor foreign girls) on the streets of France, who he depicted as the security threat. By \"rescuing\" these victims of trafficking and returning them home, he proposed to solve the situation. He argued that the only way to achieve this was to arrest them and then send them back to their families (\"Si le racolage est reconnu comme un délit, les forces de l'ordre pourront, parce qu'elles auront commis un délit, ramener ces filles chez elles\"), which he stated to be a humanitarian duty \"c'est un devoir, dirai-je, humanitaire que de raccompagner cette personne chez elle\" (I will say it is a humanitarian duty to return such a person to their home).\n\n\"Far be it for me to suggest punishing these poor girls: The offense that we are creating must come to their aid ... I hope that these women will have a better future than facing degrading encounters night after night\"\n\nIn drawing this distinction, Sarkozy made frequent reference to the inability to speak French, constructing the issue as a defense of French. He suggested that this made them vulnerable to exploitation, and that the Police would take them home. This last point became a target of those who believed they were being sent back to the conditions that made them leave in the first place.\n\nChanges to trafficking policy in 2003 were more influenced by European and international influence than domestic concerns, but trafficking was finally defined as well as giving victims residence permits in exchange for testimony. Critics doubted the practicality or whether the benefits were equally distributed between the women and the authorities, an expression of the tension between human rights and public security.\n\nIn April 2006, Senator Nicole Borvo (PCF) attempted to introduce a private bill to repeal the Sarkozy law, arguing that it had been ineffective, and turned victims into criminals. The framework was very similar to the 2001 Deryck report, depicting prostitution as violence rather than law and order, and seeking punishment of exploiters, but also measures for prevention and support.\nIn April 2011, a parliamentary commission report (\"En finir avec le mythe du plus vieux métier du monde\") recommended the adoption of the Swedish approach of criminalizing the purchase of sex.\nThe social affairs minister, Roselyne Bachelot, supported the proposal, stating, \"There is no such thing as freely chosen and consenting prostitution. The sale of sexual acts means women's bodies are made available for men, independently of the wishes of those women.\" Other support came from .\nThe French sex worker movement has condemned the proposals.\nIn October and November 2013, French lawmakers began debating a proposal to punish customers of prostitution. On December 4, the National Assembly passed a bill fining customers of prostitutes by 268 votes to 138, with 79 abstaining, which would impose fines of at least €1500 on clients caught paying for sexual relations. Within the National Assembly, most of those who supported the bill were MPs from the Socialist Party, which dominates the house. The law was passed in the National Assembly on December 4, 2013. The bill caused considerable controversy in France among politicians and intellectuals, some for legalizing prostitution, and others wanting it banned. The bill was opposed by many sex workers, and was rejected by the French Senate in July 2014.\n\nFinally, on 6 April 2016, the French National Assembly voted to fine customers of prostitutes €1500.\n\nCritics say most of the frames (nuisance, victim, deviant, security threat) in which sex work is discussed in France are constructed without the input of sex workers who are depicted as voiceless and agencyless. There are exceptions such as the French lesbian feminist Claudie Lesselier.\n\nCSA,\na polling organization, has carried out several surveys on prostitution in France. A 2002 telephone survey analyzed French attitudes about prostitution. 64% of respondents said that prostitution was \"a degrading practice for the image and the dignity of the woman (or the man)\". 66% of those questioned favored the re-opening of the \"maisons closes\" (brothels - see Maisons closes, below), 37% wanted the clients to be criminalized, 22% wanted the prostitutes to be criminalized and 33% wanted all forms of prostitution to be illegal. When analyzed and broken down by age and gender, the survey showed that some people gave contradictory answers: For example, some people appeared to favor both the re-opening of the \"maisons\" (brothels) and the interdiction of all forms of prostitution (probably believing that both solutions would work, as the survey showed that most people were dissatisfied with the existing legal situation). Older people and men were more accepting of the idea of having legalized brothels.\nIn the 2006 poll, only 14% thought prostitution should be illegal.\nPoll results reported in 2010 gave 59% in favor of re-opening of the brothels, and 10% opposed.\nLiberalization is opposed by abolitionist groups such as \"Mouvement du Nid\".\n\nIn May 2011, the seventh anniversary of the introduction of the LSI, Médecins du Monde released a very critical report on the effect of the law, and called for its repeal.\n\nStudies from 2003 estimated that about 15,000 - 20,000 women work as prostitutes in France.\nIn 2010, the number of full-time male and female prostitutes was estimated at 20,000 - 30,000, with 80% being foreigners. In 2018 it was estimated there were 30,000 prostitutes in the country and 90% were foreign.\n\nSex work in France, like other countries takes many forms. These include street prostitution, escort services, bars, and apartment prostitution. Street prostitution is partly controlled by pimps, while other workers are autonomous prostitutes. In some areas, such as Lyon or the Bois de Boulogne in Paris, sex workers use vans (see illustration). The most famous prostitution street in Paris, the \"la Rue Saint-Denis\", has been somewhat gentrified in recent years and the prostitutes have been moved further north. Escort services where one hires a woman or man for \"entertainment\" or companionship, but usually including sex, are less common in France, compared to North America. In bars, women try to induce men to buy expensive drinks along with sexual acts. Prices are set by the bar owner, and the money is shared between the owner and the prostitute. Pigalle peepshows are well known for practicing such scams. Prostitution in apartments is advertised in adult newspapers and magazines. Swingers' clubs are places where partner-swapping occurs and sometimes paid prostitutes are in attendance, as well as \"amateur\" women and couples who get in without paying the flat-rate charge of about 80 to 120 euros that men pay, including food, drink and unlimited sex sessions, with the added twist that these are performed in the open in full view of all the guests.\n\nBrothels () remain illegal, but operate discreetly and clandestinely. Since their official closure in 1946, there have been periodic calls for their re-opening. In 1990, (RPR), a former Minister of Health (1986-1988), suggested re-opening them in 1990 as a public health measure. A row erupted in 2002 with the proposal by Françoise de Panafieu (UMP), which divided French feminists, with Gisèle Halimi denouncing it, but Élisabeth Badinter seeing it as an issue of \"the right to dispose freely of one's body\".\n\nA 2010 proposal by Chantal Brunel for a return to regulated brothels was opposed by French sex workers (see Politics, above).\n\nMeanwhile, Spain has exploited the difference between the two countries by opening brothels along the French-Spanish border.\n\nIn 2004, the average earnings of a French prostitute were estimated at €500 a day. For Sub-Saharian prostitutes living in France, it was less, around €200-300. Some barely made €50-150 a week.\n\nNicolas Sarkozy recognized that the traditional sex worker was part of France's national cultural heritage. \nPaintings and drawings of \"maisons closes\" (brothels), and prostitution appear frequently in art over the centuries, some of which are shown here. Some of the best known are scenes in brothels produced by Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec, Edgar Degas and Pablo Picasso, among others. \nBrassaï published photographs of brothels in his 1935 book \"Voluptés de Paris\". A voluminous illustrated work on the phenomenon is \"Maisons closes. L'histoire, l'art, la littérature, les moeurs\" by Romi (Robert Miquet), first published in 1952.\n\nAmongst writers depicting the life of women in prostitution in France are Honoré de Balzac and Victor Hugo (see bibliography).\n\nThe Musée de l'Erotisme in Paris devotes one floor to the \"maisons closes\". It exhibits \"Polissons et galipettes\", a collection of short erotic silent movies that were used to entertain brothel visitors, and copies of \"Le Guide Rose\", a contemporary brothel guide that also carried advertising. The 2003 BBC Four documentary \"Storyville - Paris Brothel\" describes the \"maisons closes\".\n\nAn exhibition about historical Paris brothels took place from November 2009 to January 2010 in an art gallery across the street from the former \"Le Chabanais\".\n\nFrance is a destination, transit, and a limited source country for women and children subjected to sex trafficking. Foreign victims from Eastern Europe, West and North Africa, Asia, and the Caribbean are subjected to sex trafficking. Sex trafficking networks controlled by Nigerians, Bulgarians, Romanians, Chinese, and French citizens force women into prostitution through debt bondage, physical force, and psychological coercion, including the invocation of voodoo and drug addiction. The number of children exploited in commercial sex has increased in recent years. Children, primarily from Romania, West and North Africa, and the Middle East, are victims of sex trafficking in France. The government estimates the majority of the 30,000 people in prostitution in France, about 90 percent of whom are foreign, are likely trafficking victims. Trafficking of male victims for sex trafficking has increased. Nigerian trafficking networks use migrant and drug trafficking routes through Libya and Italy to transport girls to France.\n\nThe United States Department of State Office to Monitor and Combat Trafficking in Persons ranks France as a 'Tier 1' country.\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

It is a critical factor in restorative implant dentistry because it is effectively the \"vertical distance [available subgingivaly] to make a transition from the smaller diameter prosthetic platform of an implant to the larger cross-sectional cervical shape of the tooth being restored.\" The term was coined by Jonathan Zamzok, a Manhattan prosthodontist, in the late 1990s.\n\nAdequate running room is necessary to allow the implant-supported crown to exhibit a tooth-shaped contour despite the smaller diameter and circular nature of implant platforms. For example, the mean mesial-distal dimension of a maxillary central incisor at the points at which it contacts the adjacent teeth is 8.6 mm, and the mean mesial-distal dimension of the same tooth at the cementoenamel junction (CEJ) is 6.4 mm. However, the implant diameter chosen for the maxillary central incisor is usually around 4-5 mm, but the supragingival tooth contours need to mimic those of the natural tooth is esthetic success is intended.\n\nAs the anatomical crown and root tapers towards the apex, the mesial-distal dimension decreases, and so the mean mesial-distal dimension at the marginal crest of bone, which lies approximately 2 mm apical to the CEJ, is smaller. The tooth has the apico-coronal distance from the marginal crest of bone to the contact point in order to increase from the much narrower mesial-distal dimension to the greater mesial-distal dimension, and this distance is partially subgingival (below the gum line) and partially supragingival (above the gun line). \"Running room\" refers to this subgingival apico-coronal distance.\n\nIn general, it is recommended that implants be given approximately 3mm of running room in compliance with the rule of thumb that implants should be placed as deep as necessary and as shallow as possible.\n\nWhen implants are placed too palatally or lingually due to aberrant anatomical landmarks, bone resorption or surgical error, it is wise to place the implant more apically to increase the available running room in order to allow for a more convex emergence profile and avoid a buccal ridge-lap of the prosthetic crown in fixed partial denture cases.\n"}

The organization consists of ten different chapters, each with up to eight branches, that all operate a medical clinic in Baja California. Volunteer students, doctors, nurses, pilots, and other health professionals travel with their Flying Samaritans branch to their respective clinic locations and run anywhere from one-day to weekend long clinics on a monthly basis. Now with more than 1500 members the Flying Samaritans mission has spread broadly across California, Arizona, and Baja California.\n\nThe Flying Samaritans' organization has four main principles: to provide primary care, specialty care, education, and emergency care. Each branch operates slightly differently, however, all strive to attain the same goal in improving healthcare outcomes for the underserved populations of Baja California. To enliven the first tenant of their mission each branch provides quality primary care to those populations that would otherwise have none. Most of the Flying Samaritans clinics are located in areas in which medical services are sparse, and therefore primary care through their clinic is essential. Those branches that do provide specialty care, such as surgery, operate in areas in which follow up is provided to ensure quality services are implemented. In order to attain educational outcomes the Flying Samaritans' branches work both to educate their volunteers, who in many instances are pre-health professionals, but also to educate their populations in order to provide more preventative and sustainable care. Some branches work specifically with pasantes who are first-year Mexican medical students that must fulfill a one-year government requirement in order to graduate medical school. Finally, emergency care is provided through disaster relief and other critical medical needs at various clinic locations.\n\nOn November 16, 1961, a group of six passengers, and a pilot by the name of Aileen Saunders, took off from La Paz, Baja California, Mexico. Headed for San Diego, the crew was forced to stop short when they unexpectedly encountered adverse weather along their course. After a stop in Bahia de Los Angeles, Aileen hit dust storms preventing her from landing in Tijuana or San Diego. She decided to land in Ensenada for the time being, but within three minutes of landing she suddenly could not see the ground as well as the 5,000 to 7,000 foot peaks in the area. Forced to circle the area avoiding the peaks, they eventually flew over the storm, and decided to land on a strip outside of the El Rosario community. In El Rosario the general store's proprietor, Anita Espinosa, acted as a translator for the group while giving them accommodations and hot chocolate. Anita told the travelers about the village's recent devastation from flooding, and the somber spirits in the community. She told them that the people would be grateful for clothing donations, and also mentioned the poor health of many community members.\n\nReturning to San Diego, Aileen and the two other pilot passengers, Leah Hanlon and Polly Ross, began collecting donations. They returned to El Rosario the Saturday prior to that year's Christmas carrying with them a surplus of clothing, food, and toys. On the excursion was also a doctor who brought with him his medical bag. Upon arriving in the community the doctor was mobbed by sick villagers, and so was born the Flying Samaritans, originally named by the people of El Rosario the Flying Angels. This same doctor not long after returned with nurses and other medical professionals, making trips every other week to provide the community with much needed medical care. They first operated out of the virtually abandoned local hospital, Hospital Civil de El Rosario, and worked to turn it into a facility they could use to treat patients.\n\nExpanding to over 20 clinic locations in more than 50 years, now the Flying Samaritans has grown to serve many populations like El Rosario across Baja California, Mexico. With the many additional chapters and branches in California, Arizona, and Baja California the organization now consists of a much larger population that provides the same quality healthcare by motor vehicle. Each branch is made up of a unique group of leaders and volunteers that travel to their respective clinics operating under the same mission founded by the original Flying Angels.\n\nThe Central Valley Chapter operates an ENT, optometry, and ophthalmology clinic, in San Felipe, Baja California Mexico. They perform ENT surgeries and eye surgeries including cataract removals.\n\nThe Gold Coast Chapter operates largely out of San Luis Obispo, and travels to San Quintin, Baja California to perform specialty surgeries at Hospital EL Buen Pastor usually on the third Saturday of each month. They travel with volunteer medical professionals, pilots, and students spending Friday morning through Sunday in San Quintin.\n\nThe Flying Samaritans Mother Lode chapter was founded in 1977 and is composed largely of volunteers from the Central and Northern parts of California. They operate their monthly clinic, Alma Luminosa, on the second Saturday of each month in San Quintin, Rancho Los Pinos, roughly 200 miles south of the border.\n\nThe Palomar chapter of the Flying Samaritans is divided into eight branches: Chapultepec, El Hongo, El Testerazo, Eréndira, Tecate Eye Clinic, Valle Redondo, Ejidos Matemoros, and Colonia Margarita Moran. Made up largely of Southern Californian volunteers as well as many student-run groups, this chapter consists of a mostly driving population of Flying Sams.\n\nThe Flying Samaritans at UCLA was founded in 2012 by Rebecca Barber and Lyolya Hovhannisyan, two undergraduate pre-health students. This Flying Samaritans clinic operates in Colonia Margarita Moran, Mexico every third Saturday of the month. It is roughly a three-hour drive from Los Angeles just east of the Otay Mesa border crossing. Also an organization at UCLA with over 200 members, the UCLA Flying Samaritans branch has grown rapidly since its formation. The Flying Samaritans at UCLA strives to provide its community with more than just immediate health care. They have devoted additional resources towards improving the overall quality of life for the community, and have conducted community needs assessments in order to better understand how to help the people of Colonia Margarita Moran. With the $10,000 scholarship Lyolya and Rebecca received in 2012 from the Donald A. Strauss Foundation they have been able to implement even more comprehensive health education projects at their clinic. Each month Flying Sams at UCLA travels to their clinic in the community and provides roughly 30 patients with free medical care, as well as, provides educational seminars for adults and children about health topics such as diabetes, cholesterol, hygiene, and exercise. The Flying Samaritans at UCLA has a goal to improve the lives of the people in Colonia Margarita Moran by working directly with community leaders and members to address more than just their health needs.\n\nIn 1999 the Flying Samaritans at UCSD was founded, but it was not until 2001 after much negotiation with the Mexican government that their clinic in Chapultepec, Ensenada, Baja California, Mexico officially opened. They operate their clinic in a Centro de Desarollo owned by the Mexican Family Health Department (DIF). Raj Chudassama, Lori Lamb, and Ritesh Bhayani founded the UCSD Flying Samaritans clinic. In 2012 President Anelah McGuiness won the Donald A. Strauss Scholarship giving her $10,000 to create a dental clinic for their Flying Samaritans branch. In 2013 they also formed a collaboration with the Rancho El Faro Orphanage in El Porvenir, an orphanage operated by the non-profit organization Corazon De Vida. They have worked on public health projections, given many check-ups, hosted donation drives, and are working to construct a chicken coop at the orphanage.\n\nThe El Hongo branch of the Flying Samaritans was founded through a collaboration between UC Riverside and Cal State Fullerton students in 2005. El Hongo is roughly 30 minutes east of Tecate where they travel to their clinic every third Saturday of the month.\n\nThe Eréndira branch of the Flying Samaritans is operated largely by students from Palomar College, UC San Diego, San Diego State University, and Cal State San Marcos. They travel roughly 3 hours past the United States border to reach their clinic in Eréndira where both dental and medical services are provided to the community.\n\nThe Tecate Eye clinic provides free optometry and ophthalmology services to patients in the Tecate area, as well as, referral patients from other local Flying Samaritans branches. Operating on the third Saturday of each month, volunteer ophthalmologists, optometrists, and medical assistants travel to their clinic, owned by the Mexican Family Health Department (DIF), in Tecate to provide free surgeries and eye care to as many patients as possible.\n\nThe Flying Samaritans at SDSU was founded in 2010 by Matthew Schrader, an undergraduate pre-health student at SDSU. Operating their clinic in Ejido Matamoros, roughly 15 minutes over the Otay Mesa border crossing, they travel on the second Saturday of each month to run their free medical clinic. Now also providing dental services, as well as, in the past women's clinics run by OB/GYNs, Public Health and physical therapy sessions to assist with daily life activity pains and strengthening.\n\nThe Flying Samaritans in Arizona has two chapters, Phoenix and Tucson, which in total operate three clinics in Baja California.\n\nThe Phoenix chapter of the Arizona Flying Samaritans, based out of the Phoenix Metropolitan area, was founded in 1991. This chapter provides medical and dental care to Puerto Adolfo López Mateos and Laguna San Ignacio.\n\nThe Tucson chapter operates a clinic in El Rosario, which is 25 miles south of San Qunitin. In 2008 this chapter began a collaboration with the University of Arizona to create a clinic in Agua Prieta just over the border in Agua Prieta, Sonora.\n\nThe Rosarito Beach Flying Samaritans clinic was founded in 1994 by Nancy Callison, R.N., and B.J. Carpenter. At first operating out of Luis Menjare's family home then moving through various clinics donated by local doctors, the branch is now in the process of building its own facilities. Providing primary care to 300 patients a month as well as hearing and eye care to roughly 50 patients a month, this branch has grown rapidly to best serve the roughly 1.5 million residents of Rosarito Beach.\n\nThe Southern California Chapter of the Flying Samaritans, previously known as the Foothill Chapter, was founded in 1977 by Gordon Gray a retired US Marine pilot. Bill and Boz French founded the first clinic in El Arco, a remote mining village 25 miles east of Guerro Negro. After ten years of servicing the community the mines closed down and most residents left the village and therefore the Flying Samaritans closed their clinic.\n\nJesus Maria clinic was founded in 1987 as the second clinic within the Southern California Chapter, after the El Arco clinic closed down. They travel on the second Saturday of each month to provide dental and medical services and occasionally optometry and gynecology services. Other branches in the Southern California chapter include Bahia De Los Angeles, Hacienda Sinaloa, Santa Ynez, El Niño, and El Testerazo.\n\nThe El Niño branch of the Flying Samaritans is run by UC Irvine medical students in the community of El Niño about 30 minutes south of the US border. Medical students have the chance to practice their clinical skills while helping the community and gaining an understanding of the culture of El Niño.\n\nThe UC Irvine undergraduate branch of the Flying Samaritans operates in El Testerazo, Baja California, Mexico about 30 miles southeast of Tecate. They also now run a dental clinic, as well as, provide public health education and projects to their community. Traveling the third Saturday of each month students from UCI along with health professional volunteers make their way to the clinic to see as many patients as they can. This is the oldest clinic in the Palomar chapter and it has existed for over 40 years\n"}

Cultural factors play a large part in what age is deemed appropriate, with the expectation for being potty trained ranging from 12 months for some tribes in Africa to 36 months in the modern United States. Most children can control their bowel before their bladder, boys typically start and finish later than girls, and it usually takes boys longer to learn to stay dry throughout the night, however it depends on the maturity and consistency of the particular child.\n\nMost people advise that toilet training is a mutual task, requiring cooperation, agreement and understanding between the child and the caregiver, and the best potty training techniques emphasize consistency and positive reinforcement over punishment – making it enjoyable for the child. The vast majority of studies concentrate on children 18 months old and older. In this age range, research suggests that children over 24 months train faster and girls train slightly faster than boys.\n\nToilet training \"accidents\" are when a child urinates or defecates in an inappropriate place, such is in their underwear or training pants, or on the floor. Accidents are a normal part of toilet training.\n\nUntil the mid-1900s, the vast majority of babies finished toilet training by 2 years, and achieved nighttime dryness by 3 years. Since then, the age for toilet training has increased dramatically. The convenience of disposable diapers, pull-up diapers (such as Huggies Pull-Ups introduced in 1989) and more efficient laundry facilities may contribute to this trend.\n\nIn 1957, the average age of starting toilet training was still under the age of one year, 11 months, and 90% of children were dry during the day by 2 years.\n\nIn 2002, the average age that parents recognized their child \"showing an interest in using the potty\" was 24–25 months, and daytime dryness was achieved on average at almost 3 years of age. Now nighttime accidents are considered normal until 5 or 6 years of age.\n\n"}

At the time, South Korea was the third-largest purchaser of U.S. beef exports, with an estimated market value of $815 million. After a number of failed attempts at reopening the Korean market, imports finally resumed in July 2008 leading to the massive 2008 US beef protest in South Korea. In 2010, South Korea again became the world's third largest U.S. beef importer.\n\nThe Government of South Korea banned imports of U.S. beef in 2003 when a case of bovine spongiform encephalopathy, or mad cow disease was discovered in a cow in Washington. By 2006, the United States Department of Agriculture would confirm a total of three cases of BSE-infected cattle, two raised domestically, and one imported from Canada. At the time, South Korea was the third-largest purchaser of US beef exports, with an estimated market value of $815 million. An early attempt to reopen the Korean market in the fall of 2006 failed when the Korean government discovered bone chips in the shipment. Sporadic attempts made in the following year also failed for similar reasons.\n\nThroughout the ban, domestic beef farmers and local activists opposed re-opening of the market to U.S. claiming that American beef would cause mad cow disease. When the Lotte Department Store attempted to sell US beef in July 2007 during the Roh Moo-hyun administration, local activists stormed the meat counters and hurled cow dung at department store workers, abruptly terminating the resumption of sales. When President Lee Myung-bak assumed office in February 2008, it was widely expected that he would relax the ban on US beef as part of the process of ratification for the South Korea – United States Free Trade Agreement concluded by his predecessor, Roh Moo-hyun. Lee Myung-bak's attempt to reopen the Korean market to US beef along with protests against the Free Trade Agreement led to the country's largest anti-government protests in 20 years.\n\nDespite the protests, US beef imports resumed on 1 July 2008. On 2 July 2008, Han Seung-soo, Prime Minister of South Korea bought 260,000 won worth of U.S. steak to eat with his family at his official residence to alleviate public worries about US beef.\nImports of U.S. beef grew throughout 2008. During that year, Australian beef accounted for 60% (12,753 tons) of a total 21,184 tons of imported beef, but U.S. beef became the second largest supplier of foreign beef with 20% (4,439 tons).\nWith continued import growth since the lifting of the ban, in 2010, South Korea surpassed US beef imports in Japan for the first time to become the largest market for U.S. beef in Asia.\n\nIn 2012 South Korea ramped up inspections of U.S. beef imports following the U.S. government's confirmation of a fourth case of BSE but did not halt imports. South Korea ended the special inspections two months later.\n\n"}

He was born in 1904 in Farmington, New York, near Rochester, New York. As an undergraduate student at Hobart College (now Hobart and William Smith Colleges) in Geneva, New York, Allen had studied organic chemistry. This would come in handy for his medical school research that would reserve a special place for him in the annals of medical history. He graduated from Hobart in 1926, and was awarded an honorary D.Sc. degree in 1940 for his medical discoveries at the University of Rochester.\n\nAllen studied medicine at the University of Rochester and supported himself by working as an assistant in his anatomy professor, George W. Corner’s embryology laboratory. Corner and Allen are credited with the discovery of \"progestin\", the original name for progesterone and not to be confused with progestin, a synthetic progestogen, in 1930 and the first isolation of progesterone in 1933 (described below and in W.M. Allen \"My Life with Progesterone\", 2005 below). He graduated with honors in 1932. After several years of teaching at Rochester, Allen was appointed professor and chairman of the Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology at Washington University's School of Medicine in St. Louis. He contributed original papers on the histology and physiology of the female reproductive organs, bringing him many national and international awards. He was the first graduate of the Medical School in Rochester to be elected to that university's board of trustees.\n\nWhen Allen joined Washington University in 1940, he was the youngest chairman of a clinical department.
