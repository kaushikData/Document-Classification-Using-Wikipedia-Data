Where no etiology can be ascertained, the disorder is said to be idiopathic.\nTraditional accounts of the causes of disease may point to the \"evil eye\".\nThe Ancient Roman scholar Marcus Terentius Varro put forward early ideas about microorganisms in a 1st-century BC book titled \"On Agriculture\".\n\nMedieval thinking on the etiology of disease showed the influence of Galen and of Hippocrates. Medieval European doctors generally held the view that disease was related to the air and adopted a miasmatic approach to disease etiology.\n\nEtiological discovery in medicine has a history in Robert Koch's demonstration that the tubercle bacillus (\"Mycobacterium tuberculosis\" complex) causes the disease tuberculosis, \"Bacillus anthracis\" causes anthrax, and \"Vibrio cholerae\" causes cholera. This line of thinking and evidence is summarized in Koch's postulates. But proof of causation in infectious diseases is limited to individual cases that provide experimental evidence of etiology.\n\nIn epidemiology, several lines of evidence together are required to infer causation. Sir Austin Bradford-Hill demonstrated a causal relationship between smoking and lung cancer, and summarized the line of reasoning in the epidemiological criteria for causation. Dr. Al Evans, a US epidemiologist, synthesized his predecessors' ideas in proposing the Unified Concept of Causation.\n\nFurther thinking in epidemiology was required to distinguish causation from association or statistical correlation. Events may occur together simply due to chance, bias or confounding, instead of one event being caused by the other. It is also important to know which event is the cause. Careful sampling and measurement are more important than sophisticated statistical analysis to determine causation. Experimental evidence involving interventions (providing or removing the supposed cause) gives the most compelling evidence of etiology.\n\nRelated to this, sometimes several symptoms always appear together, or more often than what could be expected, though it is known that one cannot cause the other. These situations are called syndromes, and normally it is assumed that an underlying condition must exist that explains all the symptoms.\n\nOther times there is not a single cause for a disease, but instead a chain of causation from an initial trigger to the development of the clinical disease. An etiological agent of disease may require an independent co-factor, and be subject to a promoter (increases expression) to cause disease. An example of all the above, which was recognized late, is that peptic ulcer disease may be induced by stress, requires the presence of acid secretion in the stomach, and has primary etiology in \"Helicobacter pylori\" infection. Many chronic diseases of unknown cause may be studied in this framework to explain multiple epidemiological associations or risk factors which may or may not be causally related, and to seek the actual etiology.\n\nSome diseases, such as diabetes or hepatitis, are syndromically defined by their signs and symptoms, but include different conditions with different etiologies. These are called heterogeneous conditions.\n\nConversely, a single etiology, such as Epstein-Barr virus, may in different circumstances produce different diseases such as mononucleosis, nasopharyngeal carcinoma, or Burkitt's lymphoma.\n\nAn endotype is a subtype of a condition, which is defined by a distinct functional or pathobiological mechanism. This is distinct from a phenotype, which is any observable characteristic or trait of a disease, such as morphology, development, biochemical or physiological properties, or behavior, without any implication of a mechanism. It is envisaged that patients with a specific endotype present themselves within phenotypic clusters of diseases.\n\nOne example is asthma, which is considered to be a syndrome, consisting of a series of endotypes. This is related to the concept of disease entity.\n\nOther example could be AIDS, where an HIV infection can produce several clinical stages. AIDS is defined as the clinical stage IV of the HIV infection.\n\n"}

Other names for change-of-shift report include handoff, shift report, handover, or sign-out. Change-of-shift report is key to inpatient care because healthcare providers (nurses, physicians, nursing assistants etc.) are essential to providing around the clock care.\n\nDuring report, the outgoing nurses discuss with the oncoming nurses the condition of each patient and any changes that have occurred to the patient during the shift. The purpose is not to cover all details recorded in the patient's medical record, but to summarize individual patient progress. The content of the report often depends on the local organization.\n\nWhile report is necessary in order to communicate important information between nurses, various problems are posed by the giving of report.\n\nThere is evidence to suggest that performing change of shift report at the bedside is key to patient safety. In 2001, the Institute of Medicine stated that \"it is in inadequate handoff that safety often fails first.\" This is because at every change of shift, there is a chance for miscommunication about vital patient information. A specific type of change-of-shift report is Nursing Bedside Shift Report in which the off going nurse provides change-of-shift report to the on coming nurse at the patient's bedside. Since 2013, giving report at the patient bedside has been recommend by the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ) to improve patient safety. However, it wasn't until recently that it was known \"how\" Nursing Bedside Shift Report works to keep patients safe. A qualitative study by the nurse researchers Groves, Manges, and Scott-Cawiezell developed a grounded theory on how bedside nurses can use nursing bedside shift report (NBSR) to keep patients safe. According to Groves et al. (2016) NBSR is used by nurses to keep patients safe by \"reducing risk of harm through conveying the patient story from shift to shift.\" Additionally, NBSR is key to reducing risk of harm because it supports the nurses ability to identify and address risks. Preliminary results from a simulation study found that the way nursing report is structured, can nurses safety oriented behaviors (like checking for pressure ulcers, double checking medications, decreasing room clutter to prevent falls).\n\n"}
{"id": "628811", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=628811", "title": "Chlorella", "text": "Chlorella\n\nChlorella is a genus of single-celled green algae belonging to the division Chlorophyta. It is spherical in shape, about 2 to 10 μm in diameter, and is without flagella. \"Chlorella\" contains the green photosynthetic pigments chlorophyll-a and -b in its chloroplast. Through photosynthesis, it multiplies rapidly, requiring only carbon dioxide, water, sunlight, and a small amount of minerals to reproduce.\n\nThe name \"Chlorella\" is taken from the Greek χλώρος, \"chloros\", meaning green, and the Latin diminutive suffix \"ella\", meaning small. German biochemist and cell physiologist Otto Heinrich Warburg, awarded with the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine in 1931 for his research on cell respiration, also studied photosynthesis in \"Chlorella\". In 1961, Melvin Calvin of the University of California received the Nobel Prize in Chemistry for his research on the pathways of carbon dioxide assimilation in plants using \"Chlorella\".\n\nMany people believe \"Chlorella\" can serve as a potential source of food and energy because its photosynthetic efficiency can, in theory, reach 8%, which exceeds that of other highly efficient crops such as sugar cane.\n\n\"Chlorella\" is a potential food source because it is high in protein and other essential nutrients; when dried, it is about 45% protein, 20% fat, 20% carbohydrate, 5% fiber, and 10% minerals and vitamins. Mass-production methods are now being used to cultivate it in large artificial circular ponds. It is commonly used as a 'superfood' and can be found as an ingredient in certain liquid-based cocktails.\n\nWhen first harvested, \"Chlorella\" was suggested as an inexpensive protein supplement to the human diet. Advocates sometimes focus on other supposed health benefits of the algae, such as claims of weight control, cancer prevention, and immune system support. According to the American Cancer Society, \"available scientific studies do not support its effectiveness for preventing or treating cancer or any other disease in humans\".\n\nUnder certain growing conditions, \"Chlorella\" yields oils that are high in polyunsaturated fats—\"Chlorella minutissima\" has yielded eicosapentaenoic acid at 39.9% of total lipids.\n\nFollowing global fears of an uncontrollable human population boom during the late 1940s and the early 1950s, \"Chlorella\" was seen as a new and promising primary food source and as a possible solution to the then-current world hunger crisis. Many people during this time thought hunger would be an overwhelming problem and saw \"Chlorella\" as a way to end this crisis by providing large amounts of high-quality food for a relatively low cost.\n\nMany institutions began to research the algae, including the Carnegie Institution, the Rockefeller Foundation, the NIH, UC Berkeley, the Atomic Energy Commission, and Stanford University. Following World War II, many Europeans were starving, and many Malthusians attributed this not only to the war, but also to the inability of the world to produce enough food to support the increasing population. According to a 1946 FAO report, the world would need to produce 25 to 35% more food in 1960 than in 1939 to keep up with the increasing population, while health improvements would require a 90 to 100% increase. Because meat was costly and energy-intensive to produce, protein shortages were also an issue. Increasing cultivated area alone would go only so far in providing adequate nutrition to the population. The USDA calculated that, to feed the U.S. population by 1975, it would have to add 200 million acres (800,000 km²) of land, but only 45 million were available. One way to combat national food shortages was to increase the land available for farmers, yet the American frontier and farm land had long since been extinguished in trade for expansion and urban life. Hopes rested solely on new agricultural techniques and technologies. Because of these circumstances, an alternative solution was needed.\n\nTo cope with the upcoming postwar population boom in the United States and elsewhere, researchers decided to tap into the unexploited sea resources. Initial testing by the Stanford Research Institute showed \"Chlorella\" (when growing in warm, sunny, shallow conditions) could convert 20% of solar energy into a plant that, when dried, contains 50% protein. In addition, \"Chlorella\" contains fat and vitamins. The plant's photosynthetic efficiency allows it to yield more protein per unit area than any plant—one scientist predicted 10,000 tons of protein a year could be produced with just 20 workers staffing a 1000-acre (4-km) \"Chlorella\" farm. The pilot research performed at Stanford and elsewhere led to immense press from journalists and newspapers, yet did not lead to large-scale algae production. \"Chlorella\" seemed like a viable option because of the technological advances in agriculture at the time and the widespread acclaim it got from experts and scientists who studied it. Algae researchers had even hoped to add a neutralized \"Chlorella\" powder to conventional food products, as a way to fortify them with vitamins and minerals.\n\nWhen the preliminary laboratory results were published, the scientific community at first backed the possibilities of \"Chlorella\". \"Science News Letter\" praised the optimistic results in an article entitled \"Algae to Feed the Starving\". John Burlew, the editor of the Carnegie Institution of Washington book \"Algal Culture-from Laboratory to Pilot Plant\", stated, \"the algae culture may fill a very real need,\" which \"Science News Letter\" turned into \"future populations of the world will be kept from starving by the production of improved or educated algae related to the green scum on ponds.\" The cover of the magazine also featured Arthur D. Little's Cambridge laboratory, which was a supposed future food factory. A few years later, the magazine published an article entitled \"Tomorrow's Dinner\", which stated, \"There is no doubt in the mind of scientists that the farms of the future will actually be factories.\" \"Science Digest\" also reported, \"common pond scum would soon become the world's most important agricultural crop.\" However, in the decades since those claims were made, algae have not been cultivated on that large of a scale.\n\nSince the growing world food problem of the 1940s was solved by better crop efficiency and other advances in traditional agriculture, \"Chlorella\" has not seen the kind of public and scientific interest that it had in the 1940s. \"Chlorella\" has only a niche market for companies promoting it as a dietary supplement.\n\nThe experimental research was carried out in laboratories, rather than in the field, and\nscientists discovered that \"Chlorella\" would be much more difficult to produce than previously thought. To be practical, the algae grown would have to be placed either in artificial light or in shade to produce at its maximum photosynthetic efficiency. Also, for the \"Chlorella\" to be as productive as the world would require, it would have to be grown in carbonated water, which would have added millions to the production cost. A sophisticated process, and additional cost, was required to harvest the crop, and, for \"Chlorella\" to be a viable food source, its cell walls would have to be pulverized. The plant could reach its nutritional potential only in highly modified artificial situations. Another problem was developing sufficiently palatable food products from \"Chlorella.\"\n\nAlthough the production of \"Chlorella\" looked promising and involved creative technology, it has not to date been cultivated on the scale some had predicted. It has not been sold on the scale of \"Spirulina\", soybean products, or whole grains. Costs have remained high, and \"Chlorella\" has for the most part been sold as a health food, for cosmetics, or as animal feed. After a decade of experimentation, studies showed that following exposure to sunlight, \"Chlorella\" captured just 2.5% of the solar energy, not much better than conventional crops. \"Chlorella\", too, was found by scientists in the 1960s to be impossible for humans and other animals to digest in its natural state due to the tough cell walls encapsulating the nutrients, which presented further problems for its use in American food production.\n\nIn 1965, the Russian CELSS experiment BIOS-3 determined that 8 m of exposed \"Chlorella\" could remove carbon dioxide and replace oxygen within the sealed environment for a single human. The algae were grown in vats underneath artificial light.\n\n\"Chlorella\" is consumed as a health supplement primarily in the United States and Canada and as a food supplement in Japan. \"Chlorella\" has a number of purported health effects, including an ability to treat cancer. However, according to the American Cancer Society, \"available scientific studies do not support its effectiveness for preventing or treating cancer or any other disease in humans\".\n\nA 2002 study showed that \"Chlorella\" cell walls contain lipopolysaccharides, endotoxins found in Gram-negative bacteria that affect the immune system and may cause inflammation. However, more recent studies have found that the lipopolysaccharides in organisms other than Gram-negative bacteria, for example in cyanobacteria, are considerably different from the lipopolysaccharides in Gram-negative bacteria.\n\n\"Chlorella\" can create green and opaque water problems in aquaria. \"Chlorella\" can grow due to high nitrate and phosphate levels or by direct sunlight. Decreasing phosphate and nitrate by partial water change and moving the aquarium to shade can help alleviate the problem.\n\n"}

He started life somewhat disoriented and in search of meaning and purpose. During the World War II, he was sent away to foster parents. Here he developed his lifelong passion for music, was able to hear classical music and take piano lessons.\n\nWhile in the RAF at 18, Clive was injured by a bullet that nearly killed him, leaving his left hand and arm partially paralysed and dashing his hopes of becoming a pianist. Instead, he attempted photography and painting but found no vocation until becoming a teacher in 1954 at Sunfield Children's Home, a Rudolf Steiner 'curative educational community' for mentally disabled children in the Clent Grove, Stourbridge. He described it as \"the first profoundly fulfilling experience of my life\". He and his wife Mildred lived with their two children, Tobias and Jennifer, on the grounds of the school in a small trailer.\n\nIt was in 1958 at Sunfield that Clive met Paul Nordoff, who was an eminent American composer and pianist. Paul Nordoff was always fascinated by Steiner's philosophy, known as anthroposophy, and was so impressed by what he found at Sunfield that he went on to explore his growing interest in the therapeutic potential of music. In 1959, Clive Robbins teamed up with Paul Nordoff and pioneered an extraordinary new way of reaching and engaging disabled children through musical improvisation, music therapy being practically unknown at the time.\n\nPaul Nordoff and Clive Robbins were both involved in the thinking and practice of Anthroposophy previous to their meeting. \"Our studies of anthroposophy had independently instilled in each of us an attitude of reverence for the destiny of humanity as a whole and the meaningfulness of each human existence\" Robbins later wrote, going on to describe the individual music therapy work that they soon began together at Sunfield as \"creative empiricism\" (Robbins, 2005, p. 10).\n\nThe time Paul Nordoff spent at Sunfield in 1959-60 working with Clive Robbins was life-changing. The two men formed a close relationship and carried out experimental musical work with many of the most disabled and unreachable children who bore tragic lives of distress and self-injury. With the help of carefully chosen harmonies, appealing melodies and rhythms, the children were drawn into musical participation developing increased social and self-awareness, discipline and concentration. Placed in front of a snare drum and cymbal, they revealed their sensitivities and their expressive, receptive and relational abilities in their musical responses. It was a profound discovery of how music could be used for human benefit and Paul and Clive documented their observations and techniques in painstaking detail, making and transcribing recordings of their sessions.\n\nWhen Paul left Sunfield in June 1960 Clive accompanied him, gripped by the urge to continue what they had started. They visited 26 curative homes across Europe, giving illustrated presentations and live demonstrations of their work, then spent the next six years in Philadelphia exploring and establishing the work which they called therapy in music. A research grant from the National Institute of Mental Health supported them in this. There followed seven years in Europe where Paul and Clive worked as Lecturing Fellows of the American-Scandinavian Foundation from 1967 to 1974. This period saw the fruition of their work together with teaching engagements across Europe, the evolution of music therapy training for musicians, publications and television documentaries about their work.\n\nIn the 1960s and 1970s, Paul and Clive toured the world demonstrating their work, with groups of followers starting to work wherever they went. After Paul Nordoff's died in 1977, Robbins continued his music therapy work, teaching and lecturing well into his 80s and renowned for his ability to inspire and captivate audiences with real-life stories of his charismatic life-transforming work in music.\n\nIn 1975, Clive returned to the US where he married his second wife Carol Matteson, also a music therapist. Together they worked at the New York State School for the Deaf in Rome, NY (1975–81), at Southern Methodist University, Dallas (1981–82), continuing courses and lectures and maintaining ties in Europe with annual teaching engagements. From 1982 until 1989 they lived in Australia where they established a Music Therapy Centre at Warrah, an anthroposophical disability service centre and biodynamic farm, and a Nordoff-Robbins Association in Australia. In 1989 a dream was fulfilled with the establishment of the Nordoff-Robbins Center for Music Therapy at New York University, of which Clive and Carol became Co-Directors. The new Centre served as a music therapy clinic and training venue for music therapists in the Nordoff-Robbins approach. Here Clive stayed active until his death, becoming Founding Director in 1998.\n\nAfter Carol's untimely death in 1996, Clive married another music therapist, Kaoru Mochizuki, with whom he worked and lectured also in the Far East - Japan, Taiwan and Korea. The improvisational approach to music therapy which he pioneered with Nordoff has influenced the entire professional field, extending well beyond the range of those who were trained specifically in the Nordoff-Robbins approach. Music therapy represents a new force in contemporary music, with roots all over the globe and the Nordoff-Robbins approach has played a pivotal role in this development, championed by Clive Robbins. It was named by its co-creators Creative Music Therapy and is both a philosophy and a practical craft, based on a deep insight into the transformative power of music in human experience.\n\nClive's gift was to help Paul Nordoff harness his musicianship, giving it direction and finding a language for communicating the ideas. Clive has inspired thousands with his love, emotion and sensitivity, his embracing personality and humanistic values. His descriptions of the power of music and its impact on the emotional states of human experience were profoundly moving to the many who heard and shared his passion for music and people.\n\nClive saw the establishment in 1996 of the International Trust for Nordoff-Robbins Music Therapy which came into being to preserve the name and reputation of Nordoff Robbins and to hold the worldwide intellectual property assets arising from the work of Paul Nordoff and Clive Robbins. He held honorary doctorates from Combs College of Music, Philadelphia, the University of Witten-Herdecke, Germany, and the State University of New York.\n\n\n"}

The concept does not include whether or not the food source is high in total protein, or any other information about that food's nutritious value.\n\nIt was once thought that plant sources of protein are deficient in one or more amino acids, and so vegetarian diets had to specifically combine foods during meals, which would create a complete protein. However, the most recent position of the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics is that protein from a variety of plant foods eaten during the course of a day supplies enough essential amino acids when caloric requirements are met. Normal physiological functioning of the body is possible if one obtains enough protein and sufficient amounts of each amino acid from a plant-based diet. In fact, the highest PDCAAS scores are not given to commonly eaten meat products, but rather to animal-derived vegetarian foods like milk and eggs and the vegan food soy protein isolate.\n\nThe following table lists the optimal profile of the nine essential amino acids in the human diet, which comprises complete protein, as recommended by the Institute of Medicine's Food and Nutrition Board:\n\nThe second column in the following table shows the amino acid requirements of adults as recommended by the World Health Organization calculated for a adult.

Types include stable angina, unstable angina, myocardial infarction, and sudden cardiac death. A common symptom is chest pain or discomfort which may travel into the shoulder, arm, back, neck, or jaw. Occasionally it may feel like heartburn. Usually symptoms occur with exercise or emotional stress, last less than a few minutes, and improve with rest. Shortness of breath may also occur and sometimes no symptoms are present. In many cases, the first sign is a heart attack. Other complications include heart failure or an abnormal heartbeat.\n\nRisk factors include high blood pressure, smoking, diabetes, lack of exercise, obesity, high blood cholesterol, poor diet, depression, and excessive alcohol. The underlying mechanism involves reduction of blood flow and oxygen to the heart muscle due to atherosclerosis of the arteries of the heart. A number of tests may help with diagnoses including: electrocardiogram, cardiac stress testing, coronary computed tomographic angiography, and coronary angiogram, among others.\nWays to reduce CAD risk include eating a healthy diet, regularly exercising, maintaining a healthy weight, and not smoking. Medications for diabetes, high cholesterol, or high blood pressure are sometimes used. There is limited evidence for screening people who are at low risk and do not have symptoms. Treatment involves the same measures as prevention. Additional medications such as antiplatelets (including aspirin), beta blockers, or nitroglycerin may be recommended. Procedures such as percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) or coronary artery bypass surgery (CABG) may be used in severe disease. In those with stable CAD it is unclear if PCI or CABG in addition to the other treatments improves life expectancy or decreases heart attack risk.\nIn 2015, CAD affected 110 million people and resulted in 8.9 million deaths. It makes up 15.6% of all deaths, making it the most common cause of death globally. The risk of death from CAD for a given age decreased between 1980 and 2010, especially in developed countries. The number of cases of CAD for a given age also decreased between 1990 and 2010. In the United States in 2010, about 20% of those over 65 had CAD, while it was present in 7% of those 45 to 64, and 1.3% of those 18 to 45; rates were higher among men than women of a given age.\nChest pain that occurs regularly with activity, after eating, or at other predictable times is termed stable angina and is associated with narrowings of the arteries of the heart.\n\nAngina that changes in intensity, character or frequency is termed unstable. Unstable angina may precede myocardial infarction. In adults who go to the emergency department with an unclear cause of pain, about 30% have pain due to coronary artery disease.\n\nCoronary artery disease has a number of well determined risk factors. These include high blood pressure, smoking, diabetes, lack of exercise, obesity, high blood cholesterol, poor diet, depression, family history, and excessive alcohol. About half of cases are linked to genetics. Smoking and obesity are associated with about 36% and 20% of cases, respectively. Smoking just one cigarette per day about doubles the risk of CAD. Lack of exercise has been linked to 7–12% of cases. Exposure to the herbicide Agent Orange may increase risk. Rheumatologic diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis, systemic lupus erythematosus, psoriasis, and psoriatic arthritis are independent risk factors as well.\n\nJob stress appears to play a minor role accounting for about 3% of cases. In one study, women who were free of stress from work life saw an increase in the diameter of their blood vessels, leading to decreased progression of atherosclerosis. In contrast, women who had high levels of work-related stress experienced a decrease in the diameter of their blood vessels and significantly increased disease progression. Having a type A behavior pattern, a group of personality characteristics including time urgency, competitiveness, hostility, and impatience, is linked to an increased risk of coronary disease.\n\n\nDietary cholesterol does not appear to have a significant effect on blood cholesterol and thus recommendations about its consumption may not be needed. Saturated fat is still a concern.\n\nThe heritability of coronary artery disease has been estimated between 40% and 60%. Genome-wide association studies have identified around 60 genetic susceptibility loci for coronary artery disease.\n\n\nLimitation of blood flow to the heart causes ischemia (cell starvation secondary to a lack of oxygen) of the heart's muscle cells. The heart's muscle cells may die from lack of oxygen and this is called a myocardial infarction (commonly referred to as a heart attack). It leads to damage, death, and eventual scarring of the heart muscle without regrowth of heart muscle cells. Chronic high-grade narrowing of the coronary arteries can induce transient ischemia which leads to the induction of a ventricular arrhythmia, which may terminate into a dangerous heart rhythm known as ventricular fibrillation, which often leads to death.\n\nTypically, coronary artery disease occurs when part of the smooth, elastic lining inside a coronary artery (the arteries that supply blood to the heart muscle) develops atherosclerosis. With atherosclerosis, the artery's lining becomes hardened, stiffened, and accumulates deposits of calcium, fatty lipids, and abnormal inflammatory cells – to form a plaque. Calcium phosphate (hydroxyapatite) deposits in the muscular layer of the blood vessels appear to play a significant role in stiffening the arteries and inducing the early phase of coronary arteriosclerosis. This can be seen in a so-called metastatic mechanism of calciphylaxis as it occurs in chronic kidney disease and hemodialysis (Rainer Liedtke 2008). Although these people suffer from a kidney dysfunction, almost fifty percent of them die due to coronary artery disease. Plaques can be thought of as large \"pimples\" that protrude into the channel of an artery, causing a partial obstruction to blood flow. People with coronary artery disease might have just one or two plaques, or might have dozens distributed throughout their coronary arteries. A more severe form is \"chronic total occlusion\" (CTO) when a coronary artery is completely obstructed for more than 3 months.\n\nCardiac syndrome X is chest pain (angina pectoris) and chest discomfort in people who do not show signs of blockages in the larger coronary arteries of their hearts when an angiogram (coronary angiogram) is being performed. The exact cause of cardiac syndrome X is unknown. Explanations include microvascular dysfunction or epicardial atherosclerosis. For reasons that are not well understood, women are more likely than men to have it; however, hormones and other risk factors unique to women may play a role.\n\nFor symptomatic people, stress echocardiography can be used to make a diagnosis for obstructive coronary artery disease. The use of echocardiography, stress cardiac imaging, and/or advanced non-invasive imaging is not recommended on individuals who are exhibiting no symptoms and are otherwise at low risk for developing coronary disease.\n\nThe diagnosis of \"Cardiac Syndrome X\" – the rare coronary artery disease that is more common in women, as mentioned, is a diagnosis of exclusion. Therefore, usually the same tests are used as in any person with the suspected of having coronary artery disease:\n\nThe diagnosis of coronary disease underlying particular symptoms depends largely on the nature of the symptoms. The first investigation is an electrocardiogram (ECG/EKG), both for \"stable\" angina and acute coronary syndrome. An X-ray of the chest and blood tests may be performed.\n\nIn \"stable\" angina, chest pain with typical features occurring at predictable levels of exertion, various forms of cardiac stress tests may be used to induce both symptoms and detect changes by way of electrocardiography (using an ECG), echocardiography (using ultrasound of the heart) or scintigraphy (using uptake of radionuclide by the heart muscle). If part of the heart seems to receive an insufficient blood supply, coronary angiography may be used to identify stenosis of the coronary arteries and suitability for angioplasty or bypass surgery.\n\nStable coronary artery disease (SCAD) is also often called stable ischemic heart disease (SIHD). A 2015 monograph explains that \"Regardless of the nomenclature, stable angina is the chief manifestation of SIHD or SCAD.\" There are U.S. and European clinical practice guidelines for SIHD/SCAD.\n\nDiagnosis of acute coronary syndrome generally takes place in the emergency department, where ECGs may be performed sequentially to identify \"evolving changes\" (indicating ongoing damage to the heart muscle). Diagnosis is clear-cut if ECGs show elevation of the \"ST segment\", which in the context of severe typical chest pain is strongly indicative of an acute myocardial infarction (MI); this is termed a STEMI (ST-elevation MI) and is treated as an emergency with either urgent coronary angiography and percutaneous coronary intervention (angioplasty with or without stent insertion) or with thrombolysis (\"clot buster\" medication), whichever is available. In the absence of ST-segment elevation, heart damage is detected by cardiac markers (blood tests that identify heart muscle damage). If there is evidence of damage (infarction), the chest pain is attributed to a \"non-ST elevation MI\" (NSTEMI). If there is no evidence of damage, the term \"unstable angina\" is used. This process usually necessitates hospital admission and close observation on a coronary care unit for possible complications (such as cardiac arrhythmias – irregularities in the heart rate). Depending on the risk assessment, stress testing or angiography may be used to identify and treat coronary artery disease in patients who have had an NSTEMI or unstable angina.\n\nThere are various risk assessment systems for determining the risk of coronary artery disease, with various emphasis on different variables above. A notable example is Framingham Score, used in the Framingham Heart Study. It is mainly based on age, gender, diabetes, total cholesterol, HDL cholesterol, tobacco smoking and systolic blood pressure.\n\nUp to 90% of cardiovascular disease may be preventable if established risk factors are avoided. Prevention involves adequate physical exercise, decreasing obesity, treating high blood pressure, eating a healthy diet, decreasing cholesterol levels, and stopping smoking. Medications and exercise are roughly equally effective. High levels of physical activity reduce the risk of coronary artery disease by about 25%.\n\nMost guidelines recommend combining these preventive strategies. A 2015 Cochrane Review found some evidence that such an approach might help with blood pressure, body mass index, and waist circumference. However, there was insufficient evidence to show an effect on mortality or actual cardiovascular events.\n\nIn diabetes mellitus, there is little evidence that very tight blood sugar control improves cardiac risk although improved sugar control appears to decrease other problems such as kidney failure and blindness. The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends \"low to moderate alcohol intake\" to reduce risk of coronary artery disease while high intake increases the risk.\n\nA diet high in fruits and vegetables decreases the risk of cardiovascular disease and death. Vegetarians have a lower risk of heart disease, possibly due to their greater consumption of fruits and vegetables. Evidence also suggests that the Mediterranean diet and a high fiber diet lower the risk.\n\nThe consumption of trans fat (commonly found in hydrogenated products such as margarine) has been shown to cause a precursor to atherosclerosis and increase the risk of coronary artery disease.\n\nEvidence does not support a beneficial role for omega-3 fatty acid supplementation in preventing cardiovascular disease (including myocardial infarction and sudden cardiac death). There is tentative evidence that intake of menaquinone (Vitamin K), but not phylloquinone (Vitamin K), may reduce the risk of CAD mortality.\n\nSecondary prevention is preventing further sequelae of already established disease. Lifestyle changes that have been shown to be effective to this goal include:\n\nThere are a number of treatment options for coronary artery disease:\n\n\nIt is recommended that blood pressure typically be reduced to less than 140/90 mmHg. The diastolic blood pressure however should not be lower than 60 mmHg. Beta blockers are recommended first line for this use.\n\nIn those with no previous history of heart disease, aspirin decreases the risk of a myocardial infarction but does not change the overall risk of death. It is thus only recommended in adults who are at increased risk for coronary artery disease where increased risk is defined as \"men older than 90 years of age, postmenopausal women, and younger persons with risk factors for coronary artery disease (for example, hypertension, diabetes, or smoking) are at increased risk for heart disease and may wish to consider aspirin therapy\". More specifically, high-risk persons are \"those with a 5-year risk ≥ 3%\".\n\nClopidogrel plus aspirin (dual anti-platelet therapy ) reduces cardiovascular events more than aspirin alone in those with a STEMI. In others at high risk but not having an acute event the evidence is weak. Specifically, its use does not change the risk of death in this group. In those who have had a stent more than 12 months of clopidogrel plus aspirin does not affect the risk of death.\n\nRevascularization for acute coronary syndrome has a mortality benefit. Percutaneous revascularization for \"stable\" ischaemic heart disease does not appear to have benefits over medical therapy alone. In those with disease in more than one artery coronary artery bypass grafts appear better than percutaneous coronary interventions. Newer \"anaortic\" or no-touch off-pump coronary artery revascularization techniques have shown reduced postoperative stroke rates comparable to percutaneous coronary intervention. Hybrid coronary revascularization has also been shown to be a safe and feasible procedure that may offer some advantages over conventional CABG though it is more expensive.\n\nAs of 2010, CAD was the leading cause of death globally resulting in over 7 million deaths. This increased from 5.2 million deaths from CAD worldwide in 1990. It may affect individuals at any age but becomes dramatically more common at progressively older ages, with approximately a tripling with each decade of life. Males are affected more often than females.\n\nIt is estimated that 60% of the world's cardiovascular disease burden will occur in the South Asian subcontinent despite only accounting for 20% of the world's population. This may be secondary to a combination of genetic predisposition and environmental factors. Organizations such as the Indian Heart Association are working with the World Heart Federation to raise awareness about this issue.\n\nCoronary artery disease is the leading cause of death for both men and women and accounts for approximately 600,000 deaths in the United States every year. According to present trends in the United States, half of healthy 40-year-old men will develop CAD in the future, and one in three healthy 40-year-old women. It is the most common reason for death of men and women over 20 years of age in the United States.\n\nOther terms sometimes used for this condition are \"hardening of the arteries\" and \"narrowing of the arteries\". In Latin it is known as \"morbus ischaemicus cordis\" (\"MIC\").\n\nThe Infarct Combat Project (ICP) is an international nonprofit organization founded in 1998 which tries to decrease ischemic heart diseases through education and research.\n\nIn 2016 research into the archives of theSugar Association, the trade association for the sugar industry in the US, had sponsored an influential literature review published in 1965 in the \"New England Journal of Medicine\" that downplayed early findings about the role of a diet heavy in sugar in the development of CAD and emphasized the role of fat; that review influenced decades of research funding and guidance on healthy eating.\n\nResearch efforts are focused on new angiogenic treatment modalities and various (adult) stem-cell therapies. A region on chromosome 17 was confined to families with multiple cases of myocardial infarction. Other genome-wide studies have identified a firm risk variant on chromosome 9 (9p21.3). However, these and other loci are found in intergenic segments and need further research in understanding how the phenotype is affected.\n\nA more controversial link is that between \"Chlamydophila pneumoniae\" infection and atherosclerosis. While this intracellular organism has been demonstrated in atherosclerotic plaques, evidence is inconclusive as to whether it can be considered a causative factor. Treatment with antibiotics in patients with proven atherosclerosis has not demonstrated a decreased risk of heart attacks or other coronary vascular diseases.\n\nSince the 1990s the search for new treatment options for coronary artery disease patients, particularly for so called \"no-option\" coronary patients, focused on usage of angiogenesis and (adult) stem cell therapies. Numerous clinical trials were performed, either applying protein (angiogenic growth factor) therapies, such as FGF-1 or VEGF, or cell therapies using different kinds of adult stem cell populations. Research is still going on – with first promising results particularly for FGF-1 and utilization of endothelial progenitor cells.\n\nMyeloperoxidase has been proposed as a biomarker.\n\nDietary changes can decrease coronary artery disease. For example, data supports benefit from a plant-based diet and aggressive lipid lowering to improve heart disease.\n\n"}

DAISY is designed to be a complete audio substitute for print material and is specifically designed for use by people with \"print disabilities\", including blindness, impaired vision, and dyslexia. Based on the MP3 and XML formats, the DAISY format has advanced features in addition to those of a traditional audio book. Users can search, place bookmarks, precisely navigate line by line, and regulate the speaking speed without distortion. DAISY also provides aurally accessible tables, references and additional information. As a result, DAISY allows visually impaired listeners to navigate something as complex as an encyclopedia or textbook, otherwise impossible using conventional audio recordings.\n\nDAISY multimedia can be a book, magazine, newspaper, journal, computerized text or a synchronized presentation of text and audio. It provides up to six embedded \"navigation levels\" for content, including embedded objects such as images, graphics, and MathML. In the DAISY standard, navigation is enabled within a sequential and hierarchical structure consisting of (marked-up) text synchronized with audio. DAISY 2 was based on XHTML and SMIL. DAISY 3 is a newer technology, also based on XML, and is standardized as ANSI/NISO Z39.86-2005.\n\nThe DAISY Consortium was founded in 1996 and consists of international organizations committed to developing equitable access to information for people who have a print disability. The consortium was selected by the National Information Standards Organization (NISO) as the official maintenance agency for the DAISY/NISO Standard.\n\nA Digital Talking Book (DTB) is a collection of electronic files arranged to present information to the target population via alternative media, namely, human or synthetic speech, refreshable Braille, or visual display, e.g., large print. The DTB files comprising the DAISY format is\n\nSince DAISY is often used by people with disabilities, many of the existing organizations which produce accessible versions of copyrighted content are moving to the DAISY standard, and slowly moving away from more traditional methods of distribution such as cassette tape.\n\nIn the United States, Learning Ally (Formally \"Recording for the Blind and Dyslexic\" or RFB&D) AMAC Accessibility, Bookshare and the National Library Service for the Blind and Physically Handicapped (NLS), among others, offer content to blind and visually impaired individuals. Learning Ally and Bookshare also allows access by those with dyslexia or other disabilities which impair the person's ability to read print. The NLS uses a library methodology, on the basis that the books are loaned (as they traditionally have been, on physical cassette), hence they are able to offer content free of charge, just as any public library can. Learning Ally and Bookshare both are subscription-based services. Bookshare membership is free to U.S. students due to funding from the U.S. Department of Education.\n\nContent from both the NLS and the Learning Ally organizations utilizes the DAISY Protected Digital Book (PDTB) encryption standard. The basic structure of the DAISY definition files remains the same, however, the audio itself, and in some cases certain information tags in the DAISY SMIL files, are encrypted and must be decrypted in order to be read/played back. The organization which offers the content provides a decryption key to the user, which can be installed into a DAISY player to allow decryption. As the encryption schemes are not part of the core DAISY standard, only players which specifically implement the necessary algorithms and key management will be able to access these titles. Bookshare utilizes its own digital rights management plan including fingerprinting each digital book with the identity of the downloading user. These actions are done to comply with law 17 U.S.C. § 121 requiring copyrighted material to be distributed in a specialized format to prevent unauthorized individuals, such as those who do not have a qualifying disability, from accessing the materials.\n\nDAISY books can be heard on standalone DAISY players, computers using DAISY playback software, mobile phones, and MP3 players (with limited navigation). DAISY books can be distributed on a CD/DVD, memory card or through the Internet.\n\nA computerized text DAISY book can be read using refreshable Braille display or screen-reading software, printed as Braille book on paper, converted to a talking book using synthesised voice or a human narration, and also printed on paper as large print book.

{"id": "55346823", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=55346823", "title": "Disability in Singapore", "text": "Disability in Singapore\n\nDisability in Singapore describes the different aspects of life affecting people with disabilities in Singapore. Singapore does not have a formal definition of disability, but has been making changes in regards to the visibility of people with disability and also with increasing accessibility of all areas of the country. Early in the country's history, human rights issues for people with disabilities took second place to the need to secure independence and building the economy. Singapore signed on to the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities (UNCRPD) in 2013 and coordinates the Enabling Masterplan with both government and non governmental organisations.\n\nA discourse of charity generally permeated in Singapore since the post world war 2 period. Support for disabled people was left to the community, who set up various voluntary organisations. The end of the war saw the British implement the welfare state based on the Beveridge Report, which had repercussions in Singapore. As part of this focus on welfare, a Social Welfare Department (SWD) was setup in 1946. SWD was meant to provide permanent assistance only for those with a permanent disability or because of old age. However, the SWD was not as comprehensive as the British system. The SWD also did not provide provisions for special education and in fact, seemed to have the idea that children with special needs would \"hinder the typical child's education.\" The 1960s and 1970s, with Singapore's emphasis on economic growth, saw a new priority on rehabilitating disabled people so as to enable them to join and return to the work force. It was only in 1981, when the first world congress of Disabled People's International was held in Singapore that began a new discourse based on the social model of disability. Disabled activists from around the world, including Vic Finkelstein, Ed Roberts (activist) and Bengt Lindqvist, elected a Singaporean, Ron Chandran Dudley as the first founder chairperson. This was to lead to a growth in disability activism from the 1980s onwards.\n\nIn 1983, the Ministry of Social Affairs held a workshop on people with disabilities and came up with a formal policy about how to advocate for people with disabilities. The workshop came up with the first nationally endorsed definition of disability that recognized their needs in society. The Advisory Council on the Disabled was formed in April 1988 and was first chaired by Tony Tan. The council emphasized the importance of integrating disabled people as equal citizens.\n\nPrime Minister Goh Chok Tong included disabled people on the Remaking Singapore campaign in 2002. Also in 2002, the government created a voluntary, affordable form of health insurance called ElderShield. The insurance helps pay for expenses in the care of severely disabled people.\n\nIn 2013, Singapore signed onto the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities (UNCRPD).\n\nFor individuals over 50, around 13.3% are considered disabled; between ages 18 and 49, around 3.4% are disabled and 2.1% of children under 18 are disabled in Singapore. Of those who have a disability, around half are considered physical or sensory disabilities. One in 68 children in Singapore has been diagnosed with autism. The number of children diagnosed with autism has increased in Singapore over time. Around 5 to 6 percent of children born in Singapore have developmental problems of various types.\n\nOnly 0.55% of the Singapore workforce has a disability of some kind.\n\nAround half of people with physical disabilities acquired them through congenital or hereditary means.\n\nIn Singapore, there has been an emphasis on rehabilitating those with disabilities. People who were unable to work have often been seen through a utilitarian lens, since they were deemed as unable to contribute economically to the country.\n\nIn addition, the prevention of disabilities was seen as important. In 1970, Singapore passed the Voluntary Sterilisation Act (VSA) which allowed any spouse, parent or legal guardian of a person with recurring or permanent mental or physical disabilites to consent to sterilization on their behalf. This gave caregivers of people with disabilities \"inordinate power to make decisions on their behalf.\" During the 1980s and 90s, many disabled people were kept at home or put into institutions.\n\nPeople who have disabilities that are less obvious face social judgement and stigma for their disability. They are often questioned whether they need assistance because they don't \"look\" disabled. A 2015 study conducted by the National Council of Social Service (NCSS) found that a third of people in Singapore would not employ individuals with disabilities. Many Singaporeans are unsure how to interact with people with disabilities because the etiquette in such situations was unclear.\n\nSince the founding of the Singapore Disability Sports Council (then named the \"Singapore Sports Council for the Handicapped\") in 1973, Singaporean disabled athletes started participation in regional and Commonwealth disability sport events. Singapore entered a team in Paralympic Games for the first time at the 1988 Summer Paralympics, and have participated in every Summer Games since.\n\nSingapore, in comparison to other similar countries, does not spend a lot of money on social welfare services. The government emphasizes the ideas of self-reliance with the family being the first line of a person's support and volunteer and grassroots organizations helping next. Because family is the \"first line of support,\" people with disabilities who rely on caregivers are \"often at the mercy of the vagaries of family relationships.\"\n\nModern views on working with people who have disabilities in Singapore have evolved over time. Nevertheless, the government does not have a \"clear definition of disability and persons with disability.\"\n\nThe Enabling Masterplan 2012-2016 recommended promoting inclusiveness for people with disabilities through educational campaigns. Several campaigns took place in 2013, some promoted by the government and others by NGOs.\n\nIn 2016, a campaign to raise Singaporean's awareness of people with disabilities was unveiled. The five-year campaign was created by NCSS and is called \"See the True Me.\" In 2017 the government of Singapore allocated $400 on people with disabilities. A school-to-work transition program for students who have developmental and intellectual disabilities was created in 2017.\n\nIndividuals with a developmental disability are able to use a Developmental Disability Registry Identity Card (DDR ID Card) which provides discounts and access to participating facilities. In addition, people with developmental disabilities are aided in police investigations by the Appropriate Adult Scheme (AAS) of 2015.\n\nAll train stations in Singapore are equipped with accessible entrances and elevators. Stations also have braille information and tactile surface indicators. Train station names are announced for the visually impaired and red lights flash to warn of door closings for the deaf. The Enabling Masterplan 2012-2016 also provided Singapore with accessible signage for public transportation and in public areas and buildings.\n\nAccessible parking is available for individuals with physical disabilities.\n\nHousing structures provided by the Housing Development Board (HDB) are free of barriers and since 2006, older housing estates have been upgraded with ramps, handrails and provide other types of assistance to people with disabilities.\n\nThe public environment since has been improved through the Code on Accessibility in the Built Environment 2013, which provides greater accessibility in buildings and infrastructure constructed after 2013. Companies are provided support through the government to upgrade existing facilities in order to provide \"basic accessibility features.\"\n\n\"Chin Pu\" (or \"Progress\") centers were set up by the Singapore Association for Retarded Children (SARC), which is now known as the Movement for the Intellectually Disabled of Singapore (MINDS). These centers or schools were first sponsored by the Rotary Club of Singapore in 1961. However, children with multiple disabilities and who had disabilities other than intellectual disabilities did not qualify for the \"Chin Pu\" centers.\n\nFor many years, children with various special needs were not accepted by schools in Singapore. One of the first schools for children with disabilities was opened on March 12, 1979 by Leaena Tambyah. The school was called AWWA's Handicapped Children's Playgroup and operated out of St Ignatius Church.\n\nSince around 2011, the government of Singapore has created early childhood intervention services which include therapy and educational support. The Ministry of Education (MOE) created the Special Education Needs Fund in 2014 to help students with disabilities buy assertive technology devices for school. In 2017, the government called for further integration of disabled children into schools. Projects such as Children in Action and Buddy'IN allowed children from both with and without special needs to interact in meaningful ways for both groups. New recommendations for special education also include placing a greater emphasis on life skills necessary for employment and living independently.\n\nThe first inclusive preschool, Kindle Garden, was started in 2016 by the Asian Women's Welfare Association (AWWA).\n\nHigher education institutions, such as Singapore Management University (SMU), don't always provide accommodations for students with disabilities on hand. In the case of SMU, when students were seen needing accommodations, the university created a committee with Jack Yong Ho as the head to procure items for inclusion.\n\nActivist, Ron Chandran-Dudley, who was also visually impaired, played an important part in the 1980s by representing Singapore at the first Disabled People's International (DPI) World Congress. Chandran-Dudley pointed out that many people who are disabled in Singapore were not in leadership positions in the organizations developed for them. He also advocated that it was important to focus on what disabled people could do, not what they couldn't do. In April 1986, the Singapore chapter of DPI, called the Disabled People's Association (DPA), was registered, becoming the first advocacy group for the rights of people with disabilities to be officially recognized. DPA continues to advocate for the rights of people with disabilities. DPA promotes cultural understanding for people with disabilities by visiting places such as schools and offices.\n\nAn organization for children with intellectual disabilities, Singapore Association for Retarded Children (SARC), which later changed its name to Movement for the Intellectually Disabled of Singapore, (MINDS) was started in 1962 by medical social worker, Daisy Vaithliningam.\n\nLegislation that supported and protect the rights of people with disabilities in Singapore started in the 1980s.\n\nThere is no law against denying service or access to people with disabilities in Singapore. The VSA, which allows individuals to be sterilized was amended in 2012 to give greater consent to people who may undergo the process.\n\nSingapore is a state party to the United Nations Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, having signed on 30 November 2012 and ratified on 18 July 2013.\n\n\n\n\n"}

Without proper prevention, nutrition, health care and medicine that is available in developing countries, large numbers of people are falling victim to AIDS.\n\nPeople living with HIV/AIDS will not only be unable to work, but will also require significant medical care. The forecast is that this will probably cause a collapse of babies and societies in countries with a significant AIDS population. In some heavily infected areas, the epidemic has left behind many orphans cared for by elderly grandparents.\n\nThe increased mortality in this region will result in a smaller skilled population and labor force. This smaller labor force will be predominantly young people, with reduced knowledge and work experience leading to reduced productivity. An increase in workers’ time off to look after sick family members or for sick leave will also lower productivity. Increased mortality will also weaken the mechanisms that generate human capital and investment in people, through loss of income and the death of parents. As the epidemic progresses, the age profile of those infected will increase, though the peak is expected to stay within the working age population. HIV disproportionately infects and impacts on women, so those sectors employing large numbers of women e.g. education, may be disproportionately economically impacted by HIV\n\nBy killing off mainly young adults, AIDS seriously weakens the taxable population, reducing the resources available for public expenditures such as education and health services not related to AIDS resulting in increasing pressure for the state's finances and slower growth of the economy. This results in a slower growth of the tax base, an effect that will be reinforced if there are growing expenditures on treating the sick, training (to replace sick workers), sick pay and caring for AIDS orphans. This is especially true if the sharp increase in adult mortality shifts the responsibility and blame from the family to the government in caring for these orphans.\n\nOn the level of the household, AIDS results in both the loss of income and increased spending on healthcare by the household. The income effects of this led to spending reduction as well as a substitution effect away from education and towards healthcare and funeral spending. A study in Côte d'Ivoire showed that households with an HIV/AIDS patient spent twice as much on medical expenses as other households.\n\nWith economic stimulus from the government, however, HIV/AIDS can be fought through the economy. With some money, HIV/AIDS patients will have to worry less about getting enough food and shelter and more about fighting their disease. However, if economic conditions aren't good, a person with HIV/AIDS may decide to become a sex trade worker to earn more money. As a result, more people become infected with HIV/AIDS.\n\nUNAIDS, WHO and the United Nations Development Programme have documented a correlation between the decreasing life expectancies and the lowering of gross national product in many African countries with prevalence rates of 10% or more. Indeed, since 1992 predictions that AIDS would slow economic growth in these countries have been published. The degree of impact depended on assumptions about the extent to which illness would be funded by savings and who would be infected.\n\nConclusions reached from models of the growth trajectories of 30 sub-Saharan economies over the period 1990–2025 were that the economic growth rates of these countries would be between 0.56 and 1.47% lower. The impact on gross domestic product (GDP) per capita was less conclusive. However, in 2000, the rate of growth of Africa's per capita GDP was in fact reduced by 0.7% per year from 1990–1997 with a further 0.3% per year lower in countries also affected by malaria. The forecast now is that the growth of GDP for these countries will undergo a further reduction of between 0.5 and 2.6% per annum. However, these estimates may be an underestimate, as they do not look at the effects on output per capita.\n\nMany governments in sub-Saharan Africa denied that there was a problem for years, and are only now starting to work towards solutions. Underfunding is a problem in all areas of HIV prevention when compared to even conservative estimates of the problems.\n\nRecent research by the Overseas Development Institute (ODI) has suggested that the private sector has begun to recognize the impact of HIV/AIDS on the bottom line, both directly and indirectly. It is estimated that a company can generate an average return of US$3 for every US$1 invested in employee health due to a reduced absenteeism, better productivity and reduction in employee turnover. \nIndirectly there are also important implications on the supply chain. Many multi-national corporations (MNCs) have therefore gotten involved in HIV/AIDS initiatives of three main types: a community-based partnerships, supply chain support, and sector-based initiatives.\n\nThe launching of the world's first official HIV/AIDS Toolkit in Zimbabwe on October 3, 2006 is a product of collaborative work between the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies, World Health Organization and the Southern Africa HIV/AIDS Information Dissemination Service. It is for the strengthening of people living with HIV/AIDS and nurses by minimal external support. The package, which is in form of eight modules focusing on basic facts about HIV and AIDS, was pre-tested in Zimbabwe in March 2006 to determine its adaptability. It disposes, among other things, categorized guidelines on clinical management, education and counseling of AIDS victims at community level.\n\nThe Copenhagen Consensus is a project that seeks to establish priorities for advancing global welfare using methodologies based on the theory of welfare economics. The participants are all economists, with the focus of the projg a rational prioritization based on economic analysis. The project is based on the contention that, in spite of the billions of dollars spent on global challenges by the United Nations, the governments of wealthy nations, foundations, charities, and non-governmental organizations, the money spent on problems such as malnutrition and climate change is not sufficient to meet many internationally agreed targets. The highest priority was assigned to implementing new measures to prevent the spread of HIV and AIDS. The economists estimated that an investment of $27 billion could avert nearly 30 million new infections by 2010.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "18571544", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=18571544", "title": "Exercise is Medicine", "text": "Exercise is Medicine\n\nExercise is Medicine® (EIM) is a nonprofit initiative co-launched by the American College of Sports Medicine (ACSM) and the American Medical Association (AMA), with support from the Office of the Surgeon General and the 18th Surgeon General Regina Benjamin, on November 5, 2007.\n\nThe Exercise is Medicine (EIM) initiative calls for physical activity to be included as a standard part of medical treatment and the patient care process. EIM urges healthcare providers to assess the physical activity levels of their patients at every visit, provide physically inactive patients with brief counseling, and to 'write' a basic exercise prescription. Before leaving the clinic setting, inactive patients should also receive a referral to available physical activity resources in the local community to assist them in becoming more physically active.\n\nEIM was started by then ACSM President Robert E. Sallis, MD, FACSM in 2007, who has continued to serve as the Chair of the EIM initiative since its inception. Under the guidance of Dr. Sallis and the EIM Advisory Board, Adrian Hutber, PhD, served as the first Vice President of EIM and has overseen the global development of the initiative over its first decade of existence. From 2007-2017, EIM grew into a \"global health\" initiative with a presence in more than 40 countries worldwide. The initial five years of the initiative focused on increasing global awareness that \"exercise is good medicine\". More recently, efforts have shifted more towards the strategic implementation of the EIM Solution in healthcare systems.\n\nThe Exercise is Medicine Solution is the practical implementation of EIM in a health system. The EIM Solution is designed as a simple, brief four-step process that can be carried in the clinic setting in under than five minutes by the entire healthcare team.\n\n1. The first step, and initiator, of the EIM Solution is the systematic \"assessment\" of every patient's physical activity levels. The Physical Activity Vital Sign (PAVS) is an evidence- and practice-based tool for assessing patient physical activity levels that has been successfully integrated into the Kaiser Permanente health systems of Northern and Southern California, as well as in Intermountain Health.\n\n2. The second step of the EIM Solution provides eligible patients (i.e., patients who are not completing 150 minutes of moderate to vigorous aerobic activity in a week) with a basic \"physical activity prescription\". Prescriptions can be given out in a number of different formats including written exercise prescriptions using a pad (a format that patients are familiar with in receiving prescriptions for medications) to semi-customized physical activity prescriptions for specific health conditions. The first major exercise prescription program was the Green Prescription started by the Sport and Recreation New Zealand in 1998.\n\n3. In addition to giving a physical activity prescription, healthcare providers may also wish to provide their patients with \"brief physical activity counseling\". Several physical activity counseling models have been shown to be effective in increasing patient physical activity levels including the 5As, motivation interviewing, and the use of the transtheoretical model.\n\n4. The final, and perhaps most crucial, component of the EIM Solution is ensuring that all eligible patients receive a \"physical activity referral\" to supportive resources to assist them in engaging in greater physical activity levels. Patients may be referred to existing physical activity resources within a health system (i.e., wellness programs, physical therapy clinics and programs), self-directed programs (i.e., walking programs, smartphone apps), or community-based resources. Within the community setting, all physical activity places (i.e., YMCAs), programs, and exercise professionals should be considered for inclusion in a larger physical activity network.\n\nExercise is Medicine on Campus (EIM-OC) is a program calling upon universities and colleges to engage in promoting physical activity as a vital sign on college and university campuses. EIM-OC encourages faculty, staff and students to work together toward improving the health and well-being of the campus community by: a) assessing physical activity at every student health visit, b) providing students with the tools necessary to strengthen healthy physical activity habits, and c) connecting university health care providers with campus exercise specialists to provide a referral system for exercise prescription. Currently, there are more than 150 registered EIM-OC campus program in the U.S., with an equal number of international programs.\n\nThe Exercise is Medicine Credential is a specialized designation earned by exercise professionals who work closely with the health care sector. The EIM Credential prepares exercise professionals to work as an extended part of the health care team and effectively collaborate with health care providers. Through this partnership, a closer relationship and line of communication is developed to assist patients who need specialized fitness programming in order to change their health behaviors and improve health outcomes.\n\nThe month of May has been designated as Exercise is Medicine Month to bring awareness to and focus on the issue of physical inactivity - one of the fastest growing public health concerns. Local communities are encouraged to celebrate EIM Month by hosting events that highlight collaborations between health systems and the local community.\n\nNumerous health and professional organizations have signed on in partnership of the Exercise is Medicine initiative including: the American Council on Exercise (ACE), the American Physical Therapy Association (APTA), the Foundation for Physical Medicine & Rehabilitation (FPM&R), the Medical Fitness Association (MFA), and the Preventive Cardiovascular Nurses Association (PCNA).\n\nOver its first decade of existence, EIM has expanded to include partners in more than 40 countries worldwide. The EIM Global Health Network consists of EIM Regional Centers in Chile (EIM Latin America), Germany (EIM Europe), and Singapore (EIM Southeast Asia) that help oversee the expansion and development of the initiative in their respective regions.\n\nTo establish an EIM National Center, national leaders in a country are required to enlist the support of a national primary care organization, a national sports medicine and/or exercise science organization, as well a leading academic institution. It is also strongly encouraged that the national ministry of health is also invited to participate as a part of the National Center. The National Center is host by a national institution (an academic institution, health organization, or other non-profit organization) under the direction of a National Center Director, acting on behalf of the National Center Advisory Board.\n\nEIM National Centers have been formally established in the following countries:\n"}

It refers to the work done in providing primary care, secondary care, and tertiary care, as well as in public health.\n\nUnder the Constitution, every province is charged with managing public health.

Health care delivery in Pakistan on the other hand, is the worst of both worlds; not only the health care delivery is predominantly private there are no watchdog bodies, agencies or audit commissions to monitor quality. The result is a thriving private practice; which is unregulated and unmonitored.

However, Chinese herbal cigarettes contain tobacco and nicotine with herbs added, unlike European and North American herbal cigarettes which have tobacco and nicotine omitted. Like herbal smokeless tobacco, they are often used as a substitute for standard tobacco products (primarily cigarettes). Herbal cigarettes are considered a \"non-smoking aid.\" European countries advertise herbal cigarettes as a cessation smoking aid. Herbal cigarettes are also used in acting scenes by performers who are non-smokers, or—as is becoming increasingly common—where anti-smoking legislation prohibits the use of tobacco in public spaces. Herbal cigarettes can carry carcinogens which can have health implications.\n\nHerbal cigarettes are most often made using standard-issue rolling papers and cigarette filters.\n\nA wide range of consumable products may be used as a filling, in lieu of tobacco. Corn silk and a number of flavorful herbs, such as mint, cinnamon or lemongrass, have been utilized by a wide number of herbal cigarette producers. Other manufacturers have included non-herbs like rose petals or clover leaves. Some use the flavorless bagasse and make the herbal cigarette depend on the flavoring; this is especially common in shisha. Some are made with dried lettuce leaves or shredded cabbage leaves.\n\n\nResearch shows that herbal cigarettes compared with regular cigarettes can be just as harmful in terms of the carcinogens they carry. Dr. John Moore-Gillan, chairman of the British Lung Foundation, states the addictive qualities to herbal cigarettes may be taken out, however other harmful elements remain. A study on Chinese herbal cigarettes found they had about the same amount of carcinogens as regular cigarettes. There are toxic components of the smoke of herbal cigarettes which are similar to regular cigarettes. Aminobiphenyl can cause bladder cancer. CO can be fatal in \"low concentration of approximately 667 μg/mL.\" CO can cause coronary artery disease as well. Short term symptoms of CO include headaches, dizziness, irritability and difficulty breathing.\n\nThe Chinese Tobacco industry markets herbal cigarettes as having health benefits, yet scientific studies show there is no difference to peoples' health between Chinese herbal cigarette brands and regular cigarette brands. Chinese cigarette brands are equally as addictive as regular cigarettes, although they are marketed as healthier. Chinese herbal cigarettes are sold in Philippines, Singapore, Indonesia, Malaysia, Cambodia, Myanmar, Canada, and Taiwan. People observed in a study showed they smoked more herbal cigarettes than regular cigarettes. Herbal cigarettes started in the 1970s and became popular in the 1990s. Two of the biggest herbal brands in China, Jinsheng and Wuyeshen, sold 1%, or 20 billion cigarettes, of all cigarettes sold in China in 2008.\n\nIn Korea regular cigarette prices have risen making herbal cigarettes a more popular smoking alternative. Evidence shows people in Korea choose to use herbal cigarettes as a smoking cessation aid. Sales of herbal cigarettes increased by 118% in 2014.\n\nA study investigating smokers' perception on cigarette products thought of as \"less harmful\" than regular cigarettes found 3.3 % named herbal cigarettes, which was higher than medical nicotine at 2.4%.\n\nOriginating from the United Kingdom in 1947, the seemingly oldest brand of herbal cigarettes are Honeyrose and Black Swan; they are currently sold worldwide.\n\n"}
{"id": "2888063", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2888063", "title": "Influenza pandemic", "text": "Influenza pandemic\n\nAn influenza pandemic is an epidemic of an influenza virus that spreads on a worldwide scale and infects a large proportion of the world population. In contrast to the regular seasonal epidemics of influenza, these pandemics occur irregularly – there have been about 9 influenza pandemics during the last 300 years. Pandemics can cause high levels of mortality, with the 1918 Spanish influenza pandemic being the worst in recorded history; this pandemic was estimated to be responsible for the deaths of approximately 50–100 million people. There have been about three influenza pandemics in each century for the last 300 years, the most recent one being the 2009 flu pandemic.\n\nInfluenza pandemics occur when a new strain of the influenza virus is transmitted to humans from another animal species. Species that are thought to be important in the emergence of new human strains are pigs, chickens and ducks. These novel strains are unaffected by any immunity people may have to older strains of human influenza and can therefore spread extremely rapidly and infect very large numbers of people. Influenza A viruses can occasionally be transmitted from wild birds to other species causing outbreaks in domestic poultry and may give rise to human influenza pandemics. The propagation of influenza viruses throughout the world is thought in part to be by bird migrations, though commercial shipments of live bird products might also be implicated, as well as human travel patterns.\n\nThe World Health Organization (WHO) has produced a six-stage classification that describes the process by which a novel influenza virus moves from the first few infections in humans through to a pandemic. This starts with the virus mostly infecting animals, with a few cases where animals infect people, then moves through the stage where the virus begins to spread directly between people, and ends with a pandemic when infections from the new virus have spread worldwide.\n\nOne strain of virus that may produce a pandemic in the future is a highly pathogenic variation of the H5N1 subtype of influenza A virus. On 11 June 2009, a new strain of H1N1 influenza was declared to be a global pandemic (Stage 6) by the WHO after evidence of spreading in the southern hemisphere. The 13 November 2009 worldwide update by the WHO stated that \"[a]s of 8 November 2009, worldwide more than 206 countries and overseas territories or communities have reported [503,536] laboratory confirmed cases of pandemic influenza H1N1 2009, including over 6,250 deaths.\"\n\nInfluenza, commonly known as the flu, is an infectious disease of birds and mammals caused by an RNA virus of the family Orthomyxoviridae (the influenza viruses). In humans, common symptoms of influenza infection are fever, sore throat, muscle pains, severe headache, coughing, and weakness and fatigue. In more serious cases, influenza causes pneumonia, which can be fatal, particularly in young children and the elderly. While sometimes confused with the common cold, influenza is a much more severe disease and is caused by a different type of virus. Although nausea and vomiting can be produced, especially in children, these symptoms are more characteristic of the unrelated gastroenteritis, which is sometimes called \"stomach flu\" or \"24-hour flu.\"\n\nTypically, influenza is transmitted from infected mammals through the air by coughs or sneezes, creating aerosols containing the virus, and from infected birds through their droppings. Influenza can also be transmitted by saliva, nasal secretions, feces and blood. Healthy individuals can become infected if they breathe in a virus-laden aerosol directly, or if they touch their eyes, nose or mouth after touching any of the aforementioned bodily fluids (or surfaces contaminated with those fluids). Flu viruses can remain infectious for about one week at human body temperature, over 30 days at 0 °C (32 °F), and indefinitely at very low temperatures (such as lakes in northeast Siberia). Most influenza strains can be inactivated easily by disinfectants and detergents.\n\nFlu spreads around the world in seasonal epidemics. Three influenza pandemics occurred in the 20th century and killed tens of millions of people, with each of these pandemics being caused by the appearance of a new strain of the virus in humans. Often, these new strains result from the spread of an existing flu virus to humans from other animal species. When it first killed humans in Asia in the 1990s, a deadly avian strain of H5N1 posed a great risk for a new influenza pandemic; however, this virus did not mutate to spread easily between people.\n\nVaccinations against influenza are most commonly given to high-risk humans in industrialized countries and to farmed poultry. The most common human vaccine is the trivalent influenza vaccine that contains purified and inactivated material from three viral strains. Typically this vaccine includes material from two influenza A virus subtypes and one influenza B virus strain. A vaccine formulated for one year may be ineffective in the following year, since the influenza virus changes rapidly over time and different strains become dominant. Antiviral drugs can be used to treat influenza, with neuraminidase inhibitors being particularly effective.\n\nVariants of Influenzavirus A are identified and named according to the isolate that they are like and thus are presumed to share lineage (example Fujian flu virus like); according to their typical host (example Human flu virus); according to their subtype (example H3N2); and according to their deadliness (example LP). So a flu from a virus similar to the isolate A/Fujian/411/2002(H3N2) is called Fujian flu, human flu, and H3N2 flu.\n\nVariants are sometimes named according to the species (host) the strain is endemic in or adapted to. Some variants named using this convention are:\n\nAvian variants have also sometimes been named according to their deadliness in poultry, especially chickens:\n\nThe Influenza A virus subtypes are labeled according to an H number (for hemagglutinin) and an N number (for neuraminidase). Each subtype virus has mutated into a variety of strains with differing pathogenic profiles; some pathogenic to one species but not others, some pathogenic to multiple species. Most known strains are extinct strains. For example, the annual flu subtype H3N2 no longer contains the strain that caused the Hong Kong Flu.\n\nInfluenza A viruses are negative sense, single-stranded, segmented RNA viruses. \"There are 16 different HA antigens (H1 to H16) and nine different NA antigens (N1 to N9) for influenza A. Until recently, 15 HA types had been recognized, but recently two new types were isolated: a new type (H16) was isolated from black-headed gulls caught in Sweden and the Netherlands in 1999 and reported in the literature in 2005.\". \"The other, H17, was isolated from fruit bats caught in Guatemala and reported in the literature in 2013.\"\n\nSome pandemics are relatively minor such as the one in 1957 called \"Asian flu\" (1–4 million dead, depending on source). Others have a higher Pandemic Severity Index whose severity warrants more comprehensive social isolation measures.\n\nThe 1918 pandemic killed tens of millions and sickened hundreds of millions; the loss of this many people in the population caused upheaval and psychological damage to many people. There were not enough doctors, hospital rooms, or medical supplies for the living as they contracted the disease. Dead bodies were often left unburied as few people were available to deal with them. There can be great social disruption as well as a sense of fear. Efforts to deal with pandemics can leave a great deal to be desired because of human selfishness, lack of trust, illegal behavior, and ignorance. For example, in the 1918 pandemic: \"This horrific disconnect between reassurances and reality destroyed the credibility of those in authority. People felt they had no one to turn to, no one to rely on, no one to trust.\"\n\nA letter from a physician at one U.S. Army camp in the 1918 pandemic said:\n\nFlu pandemics typically come in waves. The 1889–1890 and 1918–1919 flu pandemics each came in three or four waves of increasing lethality. But within a wave, mortality was greater at the beginning of the wave.\n\nMortality varies widely in a pandemic. In the 1918 pandemic:\n\nThe 1918 flu pandemic, commonly referred to as the Spanish flu, was a category 5 influenza pandemic caused by an unusually severe and deadly Influenza A virus strain of subtype H1N1.\n\nThe Spanish flu pandemic lasted from 1918 to 1920. Older estimates say it killed 40–50 million people while current estimates say 50 million to 100 million people worldwide were killed. This pandemic has been described as \"the greatest medical holocaust in history\" and may have killed as many people as the Black Death, although the Black Death is estimated to have killed over a fifth of the world's population at the time, a significantly higher proportion. This huge death toll was caused by an extremely high infection rate of up to 50% and the extreme severity of the symptoms, suspected to be caused by cytokine storms. Indeed, symptoms in 1918 were so unusual that initially influenza was misdiagnosed as dengue, cholera, or typhoid. One observer wrote, \"One of the most striking of the complications was hemorrhage from mucous membranes, especially from the nose, stomach, and intestine. Bleeding from the ears and petechial hemorrhages in the skin also occurred.\" The majority of deaths were from bacterial pneumonia, a secondary infection caused by influenza, but the virus also killed people directly, causing massive hemorrhages and edema in the lung.\n\nThe Spanish flu pandemic was truly global, spreading even to the Arctic and remote Pacific islands. The unusually severe disease killed between 2 and 20% of those infected, as opposed to the more usual flu epidemic mortality rate of 0.1%. Another unusual feature of this pandemic was that it mostly killed young adults, with 99% of pandemic influenza deaths occurring in people under 65, and more than half in young adults 20 to 40 years old. This is unusual since influenza is normally most deadly to the very young (under age 2) and the very old (over age 70). The total mortality of the 1918–1919 pandemic is not known, but it is estimated that up to 1% of the world's population was killed. As many as 25 million may have been killed in the first 25 weeks; in contrast, HIV/AIDS has killed 25 million in its first 25 years.\n\nThe \"Asian Flu\" was a category 2 flu pandemic outbreak of avian influenza that originated in China in early 1956 lasting until 1958. It originated from a mutation in wild ducks combining with a pre-existing human strain. The virus was first identified in Guizhou. It spread to Singapore in February 1957, reached Hong Kong by April, and US by June. Death toll in the US was approximately 69,800. The elderly were particularly vulnerable. Estimates of worldwide deaths vary widely depending on source, ranging from 1 million to 4 million.\n\nThe Hong Kong Flu was a category 2 flu pandemic caused by a strain of H3N2 descended from H2N2 by antigenic shift, in which genes from multiple subtypes reassorted to form a new virus. The Hong Kong Flu pandemic of 1968 and 1969 killed an estimated one million people worldwide. Those over 65 had the greatest death rates. In the US, there were about 33,800 deaths.\n\nIn 1977, a strain of H1N1 appeared. It was a \"benign\" pandemic, primarily affecting people born after 1950, because the older generation had protective immunity resulting from prior experience with H1N1 strains. The 1977 virus was similar to other A/H1N1 viruses that had circulated prior to 1957. The virus was included in the 1978–79 vaccine.\n\nAn epidemic of influenza-like illness of unknown causation occurred in Mexico in March–April 2009. On 24 April 2009, following the isolation of an A/H1N1 influenza in 7 ill patients in the southwest US. The WHO issued a statement on the outbreak of \"influenza like illness\" in the confirmed cases of A/H1N1 influenza had been reported in Mexico, and that 20 confirmed cases of the disease had been reported in the US.The next day, the number of confirmed cases rose to 40 in the US, 26 in Mexico, 6 in Canada, and 1 in Spain. The disease spread rapidly through the rest of the spring, and by 3 May, a total of 787 confirmed cases had been reported worldwide.\nOn 11 June 2009, the ongoing outbreak of Influenza A/H1N1, commonly referred to as \"swine flu\", was officially declared by the WHO to be the first influenza pandemic of the 21st century and a new strain of Influenza A virus subtype H1N1 first identified in April 2009. It is thought to be a mutation (reassortment) of four known strains of influenza A virus subtype H1N1: one endemic in humans, one endemic in birds, and two endemic in pigs (swine). The rapid spread of this new virus was likely due to a general lack of pre-existing antibody-mediated immunity in the human population.\n\nOn 1 November 2009, a worldwide update by the WHO stated that \"199 countries and overseas territories/communities have officially reported a total of over 482,300 laboratory confirmed cases of the influenza pandemic H1N1 infection, that included 6,071 deaths.\" By the end of the pandemic, there were more than 18,000 laboratory confirmed deaths from H1N1. Due to inadequate surveillance and lack of healthcare in many countries, the actual total of cases and deaths was likely much higher than reported. Experts, including the WHO, have since agreed that an estimated 284,500 people were killed by the disease, about 15 times the number of deaths in the initial death toll.\n\n\"Human influenza virus\" usually refers to those subtypes that spread widely among humans. H1N1, H1N2, and H3N2 are the only known Influenza A virus subtypes currently circulating among humans.\n\nGenetic factors in distinguishing between \"human flu viruses\" and \"avian influenza viruses\" include:\n\n\"About 52 key genetic changes distinguish avian influenza strains from those that spread easily among people, according to researchers in Taiwan, who analyzed the genes of more than 400 A type flu viruses.\" \"How many mutations would make an avian virus capable of infecting humans efficiently, or how many mutations would render an influenza virus a pandemic strain, is difficult to predict. We have examined sequences from the 1918 strain, which is the only pandemic influenza virus that could be entirely derived from avian strains. Of the 52 species-associated positions, 16 have residues typical for human strains; the others remained as avian signatures. The result supports the hypothesis that the 1918 pandemic virus is more closely related to the avian influenza A virus than are other human influenza viruses.\"\n\nHighly pathogenic H5N1 avian influenza kills 50% of humans that catch it. In one case, a boy with H5N1 experienced diarrhea followed rapidly by a coma without developing respiratory or flu-like symptoms.\n\nThe Influenza A virus subtypes that have been confirmed in humans, ordered by the number of known human pandemic deaths, are:\n\n\nH1N1 is currently endemic in both human and pig populations. A variant of H1N1 was responsible for the Spanish flu pandemic that killed some 50 million to 100 million people worldwide over about a year in 1918 and 1919. Controversy arose in October 2005, after the H1N1 genome was published in the journal, \"Science\". Many fear that this information could be used for bioterrorism.\n\n\"When he compared the 1918 virus with today's human flu viruses, Dr. Taubenberger noticed that it had alterations in just 25 to 30 of the virus's 4,400 amino acids. Those few changes turned a bird virus into a killer that could spread from person to person.\"\n\nIn mid-April 2009, an H1N1 variant appeared in Mexico, with its center in Mexico City. By 26 April the variant had spread widely; with cases reported in Canada, the US, New Zealand, the UK, France, Spain and Israel. On 29 April WHO raised the worldwide pandemic phase to 5. On 11 June 2009 the WHO raised the worldwide pandemic phase to 6, which means that the H1N1 swine flu has reached pandemic proportions, with nearly 30,000 confirmed cases worldwide. 8 November 2009 worldwide update by the UN's World Health Organization (WHO) states that \"206 countries and overseas territories/communities have officially reported over 503,536 laboratory confirmed cases of the influenza pandemic H1N1 infection, including 6,250 deaths.\" \n\n\n\nThe Asian Flu was a pandemic outbreak of H2N2 avian influenza that originated in China in 1957, spread worldwide that same year during which an influenza vaccine was developed, lasted until 1958 and caused between one and four million deaths.\n\n\nH3N2 is currently endemic in both human and pig populations. It evolved from H2N2 by antigenic shift and caused the Hong Kong Flu pandemic of 1968 and 1969 that killed up to 750,000.\"An early-onset, severe form of influenza A H3N2 made headlines when it claimed the lives of several children in the United States in late 2003.\"\n\nThe dominant strain of annual flu in January 2006 is H3N2. Measured resistance to the standard antiviral drugs amantadine and rimantadine in H3N2 has increased from 1% in 1994 to 12% in 2003 to 91% in 2005.\n\n\"[C]ontemporary human H3N2 influenza viruses are now endemic in pigs in southern China and can reassort with avian H5N1 viruses in this intermediate host.\"\n\n\nH7N7 has unusual zoonotic potential. In 2003 in Netherlands 89 people were confirmed to have H7N7 influenza virus infection following an outbreak in poultry on several farms. One death was recorded.\n\n\nH1N2 is currently endemic in both human and pig populations. The new H1N2 strain appears to have resulted from the reassortment of the genes of the currently circulating influenza H1N1 and H3N2 subtypes. The hemagglutinin protein of the H1N2 virus is similar to that of the currently circulating H1N1 viruses and the neuraminidase protein is similar to that of the current H3N2 viruses.\n\nThis section contains strategies to prevent a flu pandemic by a Council on Foreign Relations panel.\n\nIf influenza remains an animal problem with limited human-to-human transmission it is not a pandemic, though it continues to pose a risk. To prevent the situation from progressing to a pandemic, the following short-term strategies have been put forward:\n\nThe rationale for vaccinating poultry workers against common flu is that it reduces the probability of common influenza virus recombining with avian H5N1 virus to form a pandemic strain. Longer term strategies proposed for regions where highly pathogenic H5N1 is endemic in wild birds have included:\n\nThe main ways available to tackle a flu pandemic initially are behavioural. Doing so requires a good public health communication strategy and the ability to track public concerns, attitudes and behaviour. For example, the Flu TElephone Survey Template (FluTEST) was developed for the UK Department of Health as a set of questions for use in national surveys during a flu pandemic.\n\nThe Institute of Medicine has published a number of reports and summaries of workshops on public policy issues related to influenza pandemics. They are collected in Pandemic Influenza: A Guide to Recent Institute of Medicine Studies and Workshops and some strategies from these reports are included in the list above. Relevant learning from the 2009 flu pandemic in the UK was published in Health Technology Assessment, volume 14, issue 34.\n\nThere are two groups of antiviral drugs available for the treatment and prophylaxis of influenza neuraminidase inhibitors such as Oseltamivir (trade name Tamiflu) and Zanamivir (trade name Relenza) as well as adamantanes such as amantadine and rimantadine. Due to the high rate of side effects and risk of antiviral resistance, use of adamantanes to fight influenza is limited.\n\nMany nations, as well as the World Health Organization, are working to stockpile anti-viral drugs in preparation for a possible pandemic. Oseltamivir is the most commonly sought drug, since it is available in pill form. Zanamivir is also considered for use, but it must be inhaled. Other anti-viral drugs are less likely to be effective against pandemic influenza.\n\nBoth Tamiflu and Relenza are in short supply, and production capabilities are limited in the medium term. Some doctors say that co-administration of Tamiflu with probenecid could double supplies.\n\nThere also is the potential of viruses to evolve drug resistance. Some H5N1-infected persons treated with oseltamivir have developed resistant strains of that virus.\n\nTamiflu was originally discovered by Gilead Sciences and licensed to Roche for late-phase development and marketing.\n\nA vaccine probably would not be available in the initial stages of population infection. A vaccine cannot be developed to protect against a virus which does not exist yet. The avian flu virus H5N1 has the potential to mutate into a pandemic strain, but so do other types of flu virus. Once a potential virus is identified and a vaccine is approved, it normally takes five to six months before the vaccine becomes available.\n\nThe capability to produce vaccines varies widely from country to country; only 19 countries are listed as \"influenza vaccine manufacturers\" according to the World Health Organization. It is estimated that, in a best scenario situation, 750 million doses could be produced each year, whereas it is likely that each individual would need two doses of the vaccine to become immuno-competent. Distribution to and inside countries would probably be problematic. Several countries, however, have well-developed plans for producing large quantities of vaccine. For example, Canadian health authorities say that they are developing the capacity to produce 32 million doses within four months, enough vaccine to inoculate every person in the country.\n\nAnother concern is whether countries which do not manufacture vaccines themselves, including those where a pandemic strain is likely to originate, will be able to purchase vaccine to protect their population. Cost considerations aside, they fear that the countries with vaccine-manufacturing capability will reserve production to protect their own populations and not release vaccines to other countries until their own population is protected. Indonesia has refused to share samples of H5N1 strains which have infected and killed its citizens until it receives assurances that it will have access to vaccines produced with those samples. So far, it has not received those assurances. However, in September 2009, The United States and France agreed to make 10 percent of their H1N1 vaccine supply available to other countries through the World Health Organization.\n\nThere are two serious technical problems associated with the development of a vaccine against H5N1. The first problem is this: seasonal influenza vaccines require a single injection of 15 μg haemagluttinin in order to give protection; H5 seems to evoke only a weak immune response and a large multicentre trial found that two injections of 90 µg H5 given 28 days apart provided protection in only 54% of people . Even if it is considered that 54% is an acceptable level of protection, the world is currently capable of producing only 900 million doses at a strength of 15 μg (assuming that all production were immediately converted to manufacturing H5 vaccine); if two injections of 90 μg are needed then this capacity drops to only 70 million . Trials using adjuvants such as alum, AS03, AS04 or MF59 to try and lower the dose of vaccine are urgently needed. The second problem is this: there are two circulating clades of virus, clade 1 is the virus originally isolated in Vietnam, clade 2 is the virus isolated in Indonesia. Vaccine research has mostly been focused on clade 1 viruses, but the clade 2 virus is antigenically distinct and a clade 1 vaccine will probably not protect against a pandemic caused by clade 2 virus.\n\nSince 2009, most vaccine development efforts have been focused on the current pandemic influenza virus H1N1. As of July 2009, more than 70 known clinical trials have been completed or are ongoing for pandemic influenza vaccines. In September 2009, the US Food and Drug Administration approved four vaccines against the 2009 H1N1 influenza virus, and expected the initial vaccine lots to be available within the following month.\n\nThe World Health Organization (WHO) has developed a global influenza preparedness plan, which defines the stages of a pandemic, outlines WHO's role and makes recommendations for national measures before and during a pandemic.\n\nIn the 2009 revision of the phase descriptions, the WHO has retained the use of a six-phase approach for easy incorporation of new recommendations and approaches into existing national preparedness and response plans. The grouping and description of pandemic phases have been revised to make them easier to understand, more precise, and based upon observable phenomena. Phases 1–3 correlate with preparedness, including capacity development and response planning activities, while phases 4–6 clearly signal the need for response and mitigation efforts. Furthermore, periods after the first pandemic wave are elaborated to facilitate post pandemic recovery activities.\n\nThe phases are defined below.\n\nIn nature, influenza viruses circulate continuously among animals, especially birds. Even though such viruses might theoretically develop into pandemic viruses, in Phase 1 no viruses circulating among animals have been reported to cause infections in humans.\n\nIn Phase 2 an animal influenza virus circulating among domesticated or wild animals is known to have caused infection in humans, and is therefore considered a potential pandemic threat.\n\nIn Phase 3, an animal or human-animal influenza reassortant virus has caused sporadic cases or small clusters of disease in people, but has not resulted in human-to-human transmission sufficient to sustain community-level outbreaks. Limited human-to-human transmission may occur under some circumstances, for example, when there is close contact between an infected person and an unprotected caregiver. However, limited transmission under such restricted circumstances does not indicate that the virus has gained the level of transmissibility among humans necessary to cause a pandemic.\n\nPhase 4 is characterized by verified human-to-human transmission of an animal or human-animal influenza reassortant virus able to cause \"community-level outbreaks\". The ability to cause sustained disease outbreaks in a community marks a significant upwards shift in the risk for a pandemic. Any country that suspects or has verified such an event should urgently consult with the WHO so that the situation can be jointly assessed and a decision made by the affected country if implementation of a rapid pandemic containment operation is warranted. Phase 4 indicates a significant increase in risk of a pandemic but does not necessarily mean that a pandemic is a foregone conclusion.\n\nPhase 5 is characterized by human-to-human spread of the virus into at least two countries in one WHO region. While most countries will not be affected at this stage, the declaration of Phase 5 is a strong signal that a pandemic is imminent and that the time to finalize the organization, communication, and implementation of the planned mitigation measures is short.\n\nPhase 6, the pandemic phase, is characterized by community level outbreaks in at least one other country in a different WHO region in addition to the criteria defined in Phase 5. Designation of this phase will indicate that a global pandemic is under way.\n\nDuring the post-peak period, pandemic disease levels in most countries with adequate surveillance will have dropped below peak observed levels. The post-peak period signifies that pandemic activity appears to be decreasing; however, it is uncertain if additional waves will occur and countries will need to be prepared for a second wave.\n\nPrevious pandemics have been characterized by waves of activity spread over months. Once the level of disease activity drops, a critical communications task will be to balance this information with the possibility of another wave. Pandemic waves can be separated by months and an immediate \"at-ease\" signal may be premature.\n\nIn the post-pandemic period, influenza disease activity will have returned to levels normally seen for seasonal influenza. It is expected that the pandemic virus will behave as a seasonal influenza A virus. At this stage, it is important to maintain surveillance and update pandemic preparedness and response plans accordingly. An intensive phase of recovery and evaluation may be required.\n\nAccording to \"The New York Times\" as of March 2006, \"governments worldwide have spent billions planning for a potential influenza pandemic: buying medicines, running disaster drills, [and] developing strategies for tighter border controls\" due to the H5N1 threat.\n\nTogether steps are being taken to \"minimize the risk of further spread in animal populations\", \"reduce the risk of human infections\", and \"further support pandemic planning and preparedness\".\n\nOngoing detailed mutually coordinated onsite surveillance and analysis of human and animal H5N1 avian flu outbreaks are being conducted and reported by the USGS National Wildlife Health Center, the CDC, the ECDC, the World Health Organization, the European Commission, the National Influenza Centers, and others.\n\nIn September 2005, David Nabarro, a lead UN health official warned that a bird flu outbreak could happen anytime and had the potential to kill 5–150 million people.\n\nThe World Health Organization (WHO), believing that the world was closer to another influenza pandemic than it has been any time since 1968, when the last of the 20th century's three pandemics swept the globe, has developed guidelines on pandemic influenza preparedness and response. The March 2005 plan includes guidance on roles and responsibilities in preparedness and response; information on pandemic phases; and recommended actions for before, during, and after a pandemic.\n\n\"[E]fforts by the federal government to prepare for pandemic influenza at the national level include a $100 million DHHS initiative in 2003 to build U.S. vaccine production. Several agencies within Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) – including the Office of the Secretary, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), CDC, and the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) – are in the process of working with vaccine manufacturers to facilitate production of pilot vaccine lots for both H5N1 and H9N2 strains as well as contracting for the manufacturing of 2 million doses of an H5N1 vaccine. This H5N1 vaccine production will provide a critical pilot test of the pandemic vaccine system; it will also be used for clinical trials to evaluate dose and immunogenicity and can provide initial vaccine for early use in the event of an emerging pandemic.\"\n\nEach State and Territory of the United States has a specific Pandemic Flu Plan which covers Avian Flu, Swine Flu (H1N1) and other potential influenza epidemics. The State Plans together with a professionally vetted search engine of flu related research, policies, and plans, is available at the current portal: Pandemic Flu Search.\n\nOn 26 August 2004, Secretary of Health and Human Services, Tommy Thompson released a draft Pandemic Influenza Response and Preparedness Plan, which outlined a coordinated national strategy to prepare for and respond to an influenza pandemic. Public comments were accepted for 60 days.\n\nIn a speech before the United Nations General Assembly on 14 September 2005, President George W. Bush announced the creation of the International Partnership on Avian and Pandemic Influenza. The Partnership brings together nations and international organizations to improve global readiness by:\n\nOn 5 October 2005, Democratic Senators Harry Reid, Evan Bayh, Dick Durbin, Ted Kennedy, Barack Obama, and Tom Harkin introduced the Pandemic Preparedness and Response Act as a proposal to deal with a possible outbreak.\n\nOn 27 October 2005, the Department of Health and Human Services awarded a $62.5 million contract to Chiron Corporation to manufacture an avian influenza vaccine designed to protect against the H5N1 influenza virus strain. This followed a previous awarded $100 million contract to sanofi pasteur, the vaccines business of the sanofi-aventis Group, for avian flu vaccine.\n\nIn October 2005, President Bush urged bird flu vaccine manufacturers to increase their production.\n\nOn 1 November 2005 President Bush unveiled the National Strategy To Safeguard Against The Danger of Pandemic Influenza. He also submitted a request to Congress for $7.1 billion to begin implementing the plan. The request includes $251 million to detect and contain outbreaks before they spread around the world; $2.8 billion to accelerate development of cell-culture technology; $800 million for development of new treatments and vaccines; $1.519 billion for the Departments of Health and Human Services (HHS) and Defense to purchase influenza vaccines; $1.029 billion to stockpile antiviral medications; and $644 million to ensure that all levels of government are prepared to respond to a pandemic outbreak.\n\nOn 6 March 2006, Mike Leavitt, Secretary of Health and Human Services, said U.S. health agencies are continuing to develop vaccine alternatives that will protect against the evolving avian influenza virus.\n\nThe U.S. government, bracing for the possibility that migrating birds could carry a deadly strain of bird flu to North America, plans to test nearly eight times as many wild birds starting in April 2006 as have been tested in the past decade.\n\nOn 8 March 2006, Dr. David Nabarro, senior UN coordinator for avian and human influenza, said that given the flight patterns of wild birds that have been spreading avian influenza (bird flu) from Asia to Europe and Africa, birds infected with the H5N1 virus could reach the Americas within the next six to 12 months.\n\n\"5 Jul 2006 (CIDRAP News) – In an update on pandemic influenza preparedness efforts, the federal government said last week it had stockpiled enough vaccine against H5N1 avian influenza virus to inoculate about 4 million people and enough antiviral medication to treat about 6.3 million.\"\n\nThe Public Health Agency of Canada follows the WHO's categories, but has expanded them. The Avian Flu scare of 2006 prompted The Canadian Public Health Agency to release an updated Pandemic Influenza Plan for Health Officials. This document was created to address the growing concern over the hazards faced by public health officials when exposed to sick or dying patients.\n\nSince the Nipah virus outbreak in 1999, the Malaysian Health Ministry have put in place processes to be better prepared to protect the Malaysian population from the threat of infectious diseases. Malaysia was fully prepared during the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) situation (Malaysia was not a SARS affected country) and the episode of the H5N1 (bird flu) outbreak in 2004.\n\nThe Malaysian government has developed a National Influenza Pandemic Preparedness Plan (NIPPP) which serves as a time bound guide for preparedness and response plan for influenza pandemic. It provides a policy and strategic framework for a multisectoral response and contains specific advice and actions to be undertaken by the Ministry of Health at the different levels, other governmental departments and agencies and non governmental organizations to ensure that resources are mobilized and used most efficiently before, during and after a pandemic episode.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "31099545", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=31099545", "title": "Intraguild predation", "text": "Intraguild predation\n\nIntraguild predation, or IGP, is the killing and sometimes eating of potential competitors. This interaction represents a combination of predation and competition, because both species rely on the same prey resources and also benefit from preying upon one another. Intraguild predation is common in nature and can be asymmetrical, in which one species feeds upon the other, or symmetrical, in which both species prey upon each other. Because the dominant intraguild predator gains the dual benefits of feeding and eliminating a potential competitor, IGP interactions can have considerable effects on the structure of ecological communities.\n\nIntraguild predation can be classified as asymmetrical or symmetrical. In asymmetrical interactions one species consistently preys upon the other, while in symmetrical interactions both species prey equally upon each other. Intraguild predation can also be age structured, in which case the vulnerability of a species to predation is dependent on age and size, so only juveniles or smaller individuals of one of the predators are fed upon by the other. A wide variety of predatory relationships are possible depending on the symmetry of the interaction and the importance of age structure. IGP interactions can range from predators incidentally eating parasites attached to their prey to direct predation between two apex predators.\n\nIntraguild predation is common in nature and widespread across communities and ecosystems. Intraguild predators must share at least one prey species and usually occupy the same trophic guild, and the degree of IGP depends on factors such as the size, growth, and population density of the predators, as well as the population density and behavior of their shared prey. When creating theoretical models for intraguild predation, the competing species are classified as the \"top predator\" or the \"intermediate predator,\" (the species more likely to be preyed upon). In theory, intraguild predation is most stable if the top predator benefits strongly from killing off or feeding on the intermediate predator, and if the intermediate predator is a better competitor for the shared prey resource.\n\nThe ecological effects of intraguild predation include direct effects on the survival and distribution of the competing predators, as well as indirect effects on the abundance and distribution of prey species and other species within the community. Because they are so common, IGP interactions are important in structuring communities. Intraguild predation may actually benefit the shared prey species by lowering overall predation pressure, particularly if the intermediate predator consumes more of the shared prey. Intraguild predation can also dampen the effects of trophic cascades by providing redundancy in predation: if one predator is removed from the ecosystem, the other is still consuming the same prey species. Asymmetrical IGP can be a particularly strong influence on habitat selection. Often, intermediate predators will avoid otherwise optimal habitat because of the presence of the top predator. Behavioral changes in intermediate predator distribution due to increased risk of predation can influence community structure more than direct mortality caused by the top predators.\n\nIntraguild predation is well documented in terrestrial arthropods such as insects and arachnids. Hemipteran insects and larval lacewings both prey upon aphids, but the competing predators can cause high enough mortality among the lacewings to effectively relieve predation upon the aphids. Several species of centipede are considered to be intraguild predators.\n\nAmong the most dramatic examples of intraguild predation are those between large mammalian carnivores. Large canines and felines are the mammal groups most often involved in IGP, with larger species such as lions and gray wolves preying upon smaller species such as foxes and lynx. In North America, coyotes function as intraguild predators of gray foxes and bobcats, and may exert a strong influence over the population and distribution of gray foxes. However, in areas where wolves have been reintroduced, coyotes become an intermediate predator and experience increased mortality and a more restricted range.\n\nIntraguild predation is also important in aquatic and marine ecosystems. As top predators in most marine environments, sharks show strong IGP interactions, both between species of sharks and with other top predators like toothed whales. In tropical areas where multiple species of sharks may have significantly overlapping diets, the risk of injury or predation can determine the local range and available prey resources for different species. Large pelagic species such as blue and mako sharks are rarely observed feeding in the same areas as great white sharks, and the presence of white sharks will prevent other species from scavenging on whale carcasses. Intraguild predation between sharks and toothed whales usually involves large sharks preying upon dolphins and porpoises while also competing with them for fish prey, but orcas reverse this trend by preying upon large sharks while competing for large fish and seal prey. Intraguild predation can occur in freshwater systems as well. For example, invertebrate predators such as insect larvae and predatory copepods and cladocerans can act as intraguild prey, with planktivorous fish the interguild predator and herbivorous zooplankton acting as the basal resource.\n\nThe presence and intensity of intraguild predation is important to both management and conservation of species. Human influence on communities and ecosystems can affect the balance of these interactions, and the direct and indirect effects of IGP may have economic consequences.\n\nFisheries managers have only recently begun to understand the importance of intraguild predation on the availability of fish stocks as they attempt to move towards ecosystem-based management. IGP interactions between sharks and seals may prevent seals from feeding in areas where commercially important fish species are abundant, which may indirectly make more of these fish available to fishermen. However, IGP may also negatively influence fisheries. Intraguild predation by spiny dogfish and various skate species on economically important fishes like cod and haddock have been cited as a possible reason for the slow recovery of the groundfish fishery in the western North Atlantic.\n\nIntraguild predation is also an important consideration for restoring ecosystems. Because the presence of top predators can so strongly affect the distribution and abundance of both intermediate predator and prey species, efforts to either restore or control predator populations can have significant and often unintended ecological consequences. In Yellowstone National Park, the reintroduction of wolves caused them to become intraguild predators of coyotes, which had far-reaching effects on both the animal and plant communities in the park. Intraguild predation is an important ecological interaction, and conservation and management measures will need to take it into consideration.\n"}

The character was also the focus of a miniseries entitled \"Stakes\" (2015), which was part of the show's seventh season. Early in the show's history, Ward himself stated that Marceline was his favorite character because he did not know everything about her history and backstory, which he felt added a mysterious element to her character. Marceline's relationship with Princess Bubblegum created controversy when the episodes \"What Was Missing\" and \"Sky Witch\" implied that they been in a relationship—a relationship that was openly confirmed in the series finale \"Come Along with Me\".\n\nMarceline is one of the major characters in \"Adventure Time\". Although she did not appear in the series' pilot, the groundwork for her design and character were present in the series pitch book, penned by series creator Pendleton Ward. Ward purposely set out to make Marceline's character complex, as he explained that \"with the female characters it’s easy to either write them as clichés or write them as the extreme opposite of those clichés ... I just try to make them have faults and strengths just like Finn and Jake have.\" Initially, in the series bible, Marceline is described as being \"friendly rivals\" with Bubblegum.\n\nThe design for Marceline was created by Ward, with small changes and additions added by Phil Rynda, former lead character and prop designer for \"Adventure Time\". Visually, Marceline has long, dark hair. She rarely walks on the ground, generally preferring to float when she travels, moves, and sleeps. Marceline, unlike many of the other characters, wears varying outfits in most of her appearances. According to Ward, her clothing changes from episode to episode because \"girls own more than one outfit\". Olivia Olson, the voice actress who plays Marceline, was impressed by her character's fashion design stating, \"she has really cool style ... I love what they come up with [in] every episode.\" Olson explained that when she goes in to record the voices for each episode, she is \"totally surprised\" by the costuming for Marceline. While she says her lines, she is able to view the animatics for the episode and sometimes has to stop to admire the unique designs. Marceline's physical size and shape slightly changes depending on who is drawing her. Rynda later called this \"one of the coolest parts\" about the character's animation due to the fact that \"every artist leaves a little bit of their own taste and sensibilities in what they draw.\"\n\nMarceline is voiced by Olivia Olson. When production on \"Adventure Time\" began, Ward contacted his friend Martin Olson, who was a writer on the animated Disney series \"Phineas and Ferb\", and asked if he knew who played the character Vanessa Doofenshmirtz on \"Phineas and Ferb\", as he wanted \"her as a voice\" on his show; reportedly, Ward was unaware that the actress was actually Martin Olson's daughter. During the casting audition, Olivia Olson first read for Princess Bubblegum, but was later asked to read for the role of Marceline. Upon seeing character designs, Olson was \"definitely impressed by the character\". Because Ward knew that he wanted Olivia on his show, Martin Olson later joked that her audition was simply a \"sham\" to please network executives. In order to get into character, Olson often dresses in a manner similar to Marceline when she records her lines; she explained, \"I always find ... that on the days that I go in to record Marceline, I’ll dress like her, in a weird way ... I’ll throw on some rock n’ roll boots, maybe some red lipstick, and just go in there.\" In flashback sequences, younger Marceline is voiced by Ava Acres. In the fifth season episodes \"Finn the Human\" / \"Jake the Dog\", an older, alternate universe version of the character is voiced by Cloris Leachman. Martin Olson also provides the voice for Marceline's demonic father Hunson Abadeer. Olivia Olson later noted that the opportunity to voice act with her father was \"pretty cool\".\n\nOlson also is the character's singing voice. Composers Casey James Basichis and Tim Kiefer produce the bass music that the character performs in the series. Many of the songs written for Marceline were later uploaded onto the internet by those affiliated with the show.\n\nRoughly a thousand years prior to the events of the series, Marceline was born to a demon lord named Hunson Abadeer (voiced by Martin Olson) and a human woman (voiced by Rebecca Sugar). Abadeer is the ruler of the Nightosphere—a Hellish dimension sustained by \"chaotic evil\"—and subsists on the souls of sentient beings. For some reason, Marceline was left abandoned on Earth in events during the Mushroom War, a mysterious war that ravaged the earth one thousand years prior to events of the series. During this time, Simon Petrikov—the name of the Ice King before he was overcome by the evil power of his crown—found Marceline in the ruins of a city and gave her a stuffed animal named Hambo to cheer her up. The two developed a caring relationship, although the crown took a toll on Simon's mental health, forcing him to leave Marceline alone. During this period in her life, she was reunited with her father, only to be disgusted by his cold and heartless ways. Although she attempted to tolerate his evil and selfish antics, she eventually severed all ties with Abadeer after she discovered him eating fries that she had made for herself. In the following years, Marceline roamed the land of Ooo and began killing vampires, who had taken over much of the land. Marceline soon discovered that, upon killing a vampire, she was able to acquire their unique abilities thanks to her demonic power to absorb souls. However, when she tried to fight the Vampire King himself, she was bitten and turned into a vampire herself. At some point, she began a romantic relationship with a magician named Ash. The two would move into the Tree Fort, but their relationship would come to an end. Presumably, around this time, Marceline befriended Princess Bubblegum, the leader of the Candy Kingdom; the two would often avoid official royal meetings and explore the Candy Kingdom's elaborate rock candy mining complex. Eventually, due largely to the mounting stress of running her kingdom, Bubblegum pushed Marceline away, leading to a rift between the two that lasted for a while.\n\nIn the series' present, Marceline eventually comes into contact with Finn and Jake in the first season episode \"Evicted!\", when she forces them from their home. In the episode \"Henchman\", Marceline tricks Finn into becoming her accomplice. In the episode, Finn discovers that Marceline is fond of mischief and pranks. Soon thereafter, the two develop a friendship. In the second season premiere \"It Came From the Nightosphere\", Abadeer is accidentally summoned to Ooo by Finn. While Abadeer ravages the land, Finn discovers that there is animosity between Marceline and her father. Finn manages to distract Abadeer by playing a recording of Marceline's \"Fry Song\", which leads to a brief moment of reconciliation between the two before Finn sends him back to the Nightosphere. In the third season episode \"Memory of a Memory\", Ash attempts to rekindle his former relationship with Marceline via trickery. Disguised as Marceline's \"spirit animal\", he tricks Finn and Jake into believing that Marceline has fallen asleep due to a sleep spell that has been self-inflicted. Following Ash's advice, the two enter into Marceline's mind to retrieve the \"memory core\" in an attempt to wake her up. Along the way, they encounter various memories of her as a child following the Mushroom War. However, the duo soon learn that it was an elaborate trick by Ash; Finn and Jake actually removed Marceline's memory of their break-up. In the end, Finn is able to convince Marceline, and she promptly attacks her chauvinistic ex-boyfriend. In \"What Was Missing\", past animosity between Marceline and Princess Bubblegum is explored when Finn, Jake, Princess Bubblegum, BMO, and Marceline form a band in order to defeat the Door Lord and recover what was stolen from them.\n\nIn the fourth season episodes, \"Return to the Nightosphere\" / \"Daddy's Little Monster\", Marceline's dad returns and gives her an amulet that causes her to become the demonic and evil overlord of the Nightosphere. After an ordeal, Finn saves Marceline from the amulet. Marceline admits that all she wants is for her father to understand her. When Finn wishes for an alternate reality in which the Lich never existed during the events of the fifth season premiere \"Finn the Human\", a universe is created in which the Mushroom War was prevented by Simon Petrikov and Marceline never became a vampire. She appears in the episode as an extremely frail and aged half-demon, who was killed when a \"mutagenic bomb\" that was frozen in ice by Simon Petrikov detonates. Jake manages to undo this reality with his wish and sets everything back to the way it was. In \"Sky Witch\", Marceline enlists the help of Princess Bubblegum, and the two are able to track down Maja, the titular Sky Witch. It is revealed that Ash sold Hambo to Maja. Only when Bubblegum trades her beloved rock shirt—which was given to her by Marceline—is Hambo able to be reunited with Marceline. After the events of \"Sky Witch\", Bubblegum and Marceline are on much friendlier ground, and their friendship is completely reaffirmed in the episodes \"Varmints\" and \"Broke His Crown\", from the seventh and eighth seasons, respectively. In \"Betty\", Marceline sacrifices Hambo so that Ice King—who lost his powers and became Simon Petrikov again—can open a portal into time so that Simon can reconcile with his estranged fiancee Betty. Although the two are reunited in \"Betty\", due to the rush of events, Marceline and Simon are unable to fully catch up before Simon reverts back to the Ice King. With that being said, in the eighth season episode \"Broke His Crown\", the two manage to more fully reunite, and as such, manage to affirm how much they care for one another.\n\nThe miniseries \"Stakes\", which aired during the show’s seventh season, documents the reemergence of five of Marceline’s most powerful vampiric foes: the Fool (voiced by Ron Funches), the Empress Eyes (voiced by Rebecca Romijn), the Hierophant (voiced by Paul Williams), the Moon (voiced by Beau Billingslea), and the Vampire King himself (voiced by Billy Brown). The quintet remerge after Bubblegum tries to extract Marceline’s vampiric essence, in an attempt to make Marceline mortal once again. The reappearance of these vampires forces Marceline, Bubblegum, Finn, Jake, and Peppermint Butler (voiced by Steve Little) to stake them one-by-one (although the Vampire King is neutralized through a scientific process that removes the vampiric essence from his body); in the ensuing action, Marceline is once again turned into a vampire, but comes to terms with her immortal fate. Later, in the ninth-season miniseries \"Elements\", Marceline is temporarily transformed by elemental magic into \"Marhsmaline the Campfire Queen\"a sentient marshmallow creature. In her candy form, Marceline is gregarious and playful, but a bit naive about the nature of the new world around her; for instance, when an enraged Flame Princess attacks her, Marceline mistakes the assault for \"wrasslin'\". At the end of the miniseries, Marceline is returned to her usual self. (Marceline details her recollection of these events via highly allegorical language to BMO in the ninth-season episode \"Ketchup\".) In the tenth-season episode \"Marcy & Hunson\", Marceline's father returns to Ooo and attends one of her concerts. While he initially embarrasses his daughter and eventually causes a ghost fight to break out, by the end of the episode, Marceline is touched that her father was willing to support her.\n\nIn the \"Adventure Time\" series finale, Marceline fights for Princess Bubblegum during the Great Gum War, and when the chaos deity GOLB is accidentally brought into Ooo, she refuses to abandon her friend. After one of GOLB's monstrosities nearly kills the princess, Marceline rushes to her side, and after a tender moment, the two affirm that they care for one another and then kiss. During the episode's epilogue, Marceline and Bubblegum are shown sitting together on a couch under a blanket, and they both touch heads.\n\nThe gender-swapped version of Marceline—named Marshall Lee—appeared in the third season episode \"Fionna and Cake\". This version of the character only had a small cameo and no lines. It was later revealed that another Fionna and Cake episode was in the works for season five, and that the plot would largely revolve around Marshall Lee. The episode—titled \"Bad Little Boy\"—aired on February 18, 2013. In the episode, the princesses that are captured by the Ice King are tired of his poorly written Fionna and Cake fan fiction stories, so Marceline stops by the Ice Kingdom to show him how to do it properly; she tells a tale involving her gender-swapped character, Marshall Lee. The character was voiced by comedian and musician Donald Glover. Additionally, Marshall Lee makes a cameo appearance in the third Fionna and Cake episode entitled \"The Prince Who Wanted Everything\", and has a speaking role in the fourth entitled \"Five Short Tables\".\n\nA six issue spin-off comic miniseries titled \"Marceline and the Scream Queens\", written by Meredith Gran of \"Octopus Pie\", debuted in July 2012. The series featured Marceline and Princess Bubblegum forming a band and touring around Ooo. The series are published by Boom! Studios under its kid-oriented imprint KaBoom, which also publishes the rest of the \"Adventure Time\" series. Other contributors to the series include Faith Erin Hicks, and Liz Prince. KaBoom has also published \"Seeing Red\" by Kate Leth, and \"Marceline Gone Adrift\" by Gran.\n\nMarceline is also featured in the iOS game \"Adventure Time: Rock Bandits\". In the context of the game, the Ice King kidnaps Marceline's fans at a concert so that they will be his fans instead. Finn and Jake must then free the captured citizens. Marceline appears as a playable character in the toys-to-life video game \"Lego Dimensions\", distributed via a \"fun pack\" containing a Marceline Lego minifigure and a constructable \"Lunatic Amp\" accessory.\n\nMarceline is a half-demon and half-human vampire. She assumed the title \"Vampire Queen\" after having killed the previous Vampire King many years prior to the start of the show. Although she is over 1,000 years old, she takes on the physical appearance of an 18- to 21-year-old. Having spent centuries traversing the Land of Ooo, she has evolved into a \"fearless daredevil\", and her fondness for mischief has turned her into something of a trickster. Consequently, in her first role, Marceline functions as the antagonist of the story, forcing Finn and Jake from their home. However, she eventually becomes their close friend once Finn recognizes that she is \"a radical dame who likes to play games\".\n\nUnlike traditional Western vampires, Marceline subsists not off blood, but rather the color red (including \"low-grade\" shades such as pink). Since she is only sated by the color itself, blood is appealing simply due to its hue (although Ward noted on his Formspring that she \"drinks blood sometimes\"). When Marceline is deprived of red, she enters into a \"feral\" state, and will instinctively try to kill others and drink their blood. Like traditional Western vampires, she is vulnerable to sunlight and is capable of turning into a bat of varying size. Marceline also possesses several powers, such as levitation, invisibility, self-healing, and the ability to shape-shift; she gained each of these powers after absorbing the essence of several powerful vampires, as documented in \"Stakes\". From her demonic father, she also inherited the power to absorb people's souls. Marceline is also a survivor of the Mushroom War. Hints of her past are sprinkled through the series; in \"Memory of a Memory\" a trip into Marceline's mind shows her as a child wandering around the outskirts of a destroyed city, and \"I Remember You\" features her meeting Simon Petrikov in a ruined city.\n\nShe was very emotionally attached to her teddy bear Hambo, which was given to her by a still-human Simon Petrikov, as revealed in the episode \"I Remember You\". In \"Memory of a Memory\", after Ash sold the teddy bear to a witch, Marceline was furious and broke up with him. In the episode \"Sky Witch\", Marceline enlists Princess Bubblegum's help, and they retrieve the bear, but in \"Betty\", she sacrifices the bear in order to allow Simon the chance to communicate with his fiancée. Although she is very independent, her detachment often makes her feel alone, as seen in \"Marceline's Closet\"; while Jake and Finn are hiding in her closet, she expresses most of her feeling via the writings of her 500-year-old diary. Throughout the series, Marceline is seen playing music; in several official sources, she is described as \"a wild rocker girl\". Several times throughout the series, she jams with Finn and Jake, and various others depending on the circumstances. She is usually shown playing her axe bass, which was formerly her family's heirloom battle axe. According to Ward, she is ambidextrous, which explains her ability to play bass with both hands. She often finds it easier to express her feelings through music, as seen with songs like the \"Fry Song\", about her father, and \"I'm Just Your Problem\", about her relationship with Princess Bubblegum.\n\nMarceline has a close relationship with Finn and Jake. Marceline and Finn have many things in common with one another; in the episodes \"Evicted\" and \"Henchman\" it is stated that the reason Marceline befriended Finn is because he simply enjoys being himself. Although she has kissed Finn platonically on the cheek twice, Ward has noted that there is no romantic subtext between the two. On the other hand, Marceline and Jake share a more complex relationship. In her initial appearances, she derived pleasure from scaring Jake, who was terrified \"of her vampire bite\". Jake, in turn, felt that she was evil and had managed to take over Finn's mind. Due to this, Jake attempted to kill her several times, to no avail. However, after the events of \"Henchman\", Jake seems to have forgotten his fear of her; in \"Memory of a Memory\", he even refers to her as a \"friend\" in one of her memories.\n\nAt the start of the series, Marceline shares a rocky relationship with Princess Bubblegum. However, as the show has gone on, their relationship has been fleshed out and changed. Marceline was the first person to address Bubblegum by her first name—Bonnibel—which occurred in the episode \"Go with Me\". Their connections are explored further in the season three episode \"What Was Missing\". In the episode, Marceline's song \"I'm Just Your Problem\" and the dialogue between her and Bubblegum implied that there may have had some sort of relationship in the past, although the exact details surrounding the nature of the relationship were not explained. This later caused an internet controversy over Marceline's sexual orientation. However, after the events of \"What Was Missing\", Marceline and Bubblegum's relationship seems to have gotten better, as the two spend quality time together in \"Sky Witch\", \"Varmints\", \"Stakes\", and \"Broke His Crown\". In the series finale, \"Come Along with Me\", Marceline and Bubblegum express their romantic feelings for one another and kiss, and the episode's epilogue shows the two seemingly as a happy couple.\n\nMarceline and her father, Hunson Abadeer, have trouble accepting one another. Initially, Marceline believes her father does not care for her, and expresses her feelings through the before-mentioned \"Fry Song\". Although they admit to loving each other, Abadeer constantly pressures Marceline to follow in the family business and take over ruling the Nightosphere, a prospective job Marceline does not want. Marceline and the Ice King also have a complicated relationship. In the episode \"I Remember You\", it is revealed that the Ice King—then, the human man named Simon Petrikov—discovered her crying in the ruins of a city destroyed by the Mushroom Wars. It was Simon who gave little Marceline Hambo and attempted to watch over her. This kind gesture made the Ice King a long-time close friend and father figure to Marceline. However, as the crown's power increased, Simon began to forget more and more about his relationship with Marceline, until he had all but forgotten their friendship. Former storyboard artist and showrunner for the series Adam Muto explained that Marceline and the Ice King's history was not part of the series' initial plan, but something that \"evolved from [the show's] original course and it will likely continue to evolve in the future.\"\n\nMarceline has attracted positive critical attention. Oliver Sava of \"The A.V. Club\" praised her as one \"of this show’s most tragic characters\". He later wrote that her addition \"was a major turning point for the series, introducing a hip, adventure-loving female to the cast who can hold her own against Finn and Jake and also has a strong connection to Ooo’s past.\" Furthermore, he noted that \"she’s been at the center of some of the show’s most emotional episodes\", and \"beyond her dramatic value, Marceline tends to just make every episode better\" because \"her writers clearly enjoy writing scenes for her\". Susana Polo of The Mary Sue referred to the character as \"one of the radder characters\" in the series. Cam Shea of IGN named Marceline's introduction in \"Evicted!\" as the fourth best moment in the series' first season. He wrote that \"sure, in this episode she evicts Finn and Jake from their home ... but hey, this is the first time we meet her and she's awesome.\"\n\nio9 writer Charlies Jane Anders wrote that Marceline's—as well as the Ice King's—appearance in \"I Remember You\" was \"one of the most intense things I've seen in ages.\" She praised Marceline's development from a \"pretty one-note villain\" to a type of person that \"we sort of knew\". CartoonNetwork.co.uk named her \"Character of the Week\" on January 24, 2012. \"The Guardian\" called Marceline the best character in \"Adventure Time\" in a DVD review of the series, noting in particular that \"she's … responsible for some of the show's best songs.\" In 2016, WhatCulture ranked her the fourth best character on the show, writing that she is a \"bad ass\" and \"the coolest character in the series\", and that—after the anti-vampire backlash in pop culture caused largely by the book and film series \"Twilight\" and the television show \"The Vampire Diaries\" in the mid-to-late 2000s—\"Marceline ... prove[s] that vampires can still be awesome.\"\n\nLauren Rearick of \"Teen Vogue\" argued that Marceline is important in a discussion of on-screen representation, as she is from \"a non-traditional family [whose] emotions ... sometimes mirrored depression\". This, Rearick argues, gave the series \"the opportunity to explore complex topics under the guise of a children's show.\"\n\nThe production crew of \"Adventure Time\" are also pleased with the character. In 2010, near the start of the series, Ward stated that Marceline was his favorite character because he did not \"know everything about her character yet\", which he found to be \"mysterious [and] cool\". Rynda claimed that Marceline was probably his favorite character in the series because \"she's just really fun to draw.\" Marceline is also particularly popular with the \"Adventure Time\" fan base, and after the release of \"Evicted!\" her popularity grew enormously. Ward later noted that he felt \"good about that. It's nice\". Marceline is also popular with cosplayers, or performance artists who wear costumes and fashion accessories to represent characters from the \"Adventure Time\" universe. The character's popularity has been recognized by the company that owns \"Adventure Time\". In fact, the official press release for the \"Adventure Time: Marceline and the Scream Queens\" companion comic book referred to the character as a \"fan-favorite\".\n\nMarceline's popularity has transcended into other mediums of popular culture. For instance, American singer Willow dedicated two tracks of her debut album \"Ardipithecus\" (2015) to the character, which were eponymously named after her.\n\nThe episode \"What Was Missing\" became controversial due to implications that Marceline and Princess Bubblegum had been in a past relationship. The controversy largely began after an accompanying \"Mathematical\" recap—a studio-endorsed behind the scenes video series implied that there were lesbian relations between Princess Bubblegum and Marceline and that the writing staff actively seeks input from fans. This incident was addressed by the show's producer, Fred Seibert, who said that \"in trying to get the show’s audience involved we got wrapped up by both fan conjecture and spicy fanart and went a little too far.\" Soon after, the video recap and the entire channel was pulled off of YouTube, although \"What Was Missing\" still airs during reruns. Seibert's decision to remove the video also proved controversial; \"Bitch\" magazine later wrote an article about how the episode \"handled female desire—female queer desire at that—in a subtle but complex way\", and that the removal of the recap and the studio's perceived treatment of the controversy was detrimental towards the acceptance of queer romance in children's television. Ward later addressed the issue and gave a more neutral view; he said that, because there were \"so many extreme positions taken on it all over the Internet\", he did not \"really want to comment on it [because] it was a big hullaballoo.\" Following \"What Was Missing\", the pairing of Bubblegum and Marceline became popular with many fans of the show, and was labelled \"Bubbline\".\n\nIn August 2014, Olson commented on the controversy, telling a crowd of fans gathered at a Barnes & Noble book signing from \"The Adventure Time Encyclopedia\", that, according to Ward, Marceline and Princess Bubblegum had dated in the past, but that because the series airs in some areas where homosexual relationships are illegal, the show has not been able to officially make clear the relationship in the series itself. Eventually, in the series finale, \"Come Along with Me\" the romantic relationship was canonized, as the episode features the two kissing. Muto told TVLine that the relationship between Bubblegum and Marceline as well as their kissing was \"an ongoing conversation... It certainly wasn’t in the show’s original pitch. It was a relationship that evolved over time.\" Storyboard artist Hanna K. Nyström was responsible for adding in the kiss. According to Muto, this scene was not originally in the script; it merely noted that Bubblegum and Marceline \"have a moment\". When Nyström was working on the sequence, Muto gave her creative control as to how she wanted that \"moment\" to unfold. Muto noted, \"When Hanna boarded that, there was a little note in the margin that said 'Come on!' with a big exclamation point. That was the only note. I can’t argue with that.\"\n\n"}

This process is performed within a legislative framework which defines the requirements necessary for application to the concerned (competent) regulatory authority, details on the assessment procedure (based on quality, efficacy and safety criteria) and the grounds for approval or rejection of the application, and also the circumstances where a marketing authorization already granted may be withdrawn, suspended or revoked.\n\nThe application dossier for marketing authorization is called a New Drug Application (NDA) in the USA or Marketing Authorization Application (MAA) in the European Union and other countries, or simply registration dossier. Basically, this consists of a dossier with data proving that the drug has quality, efficacy and safety properties suitable for the intended use, additional administrative documents, samples of finished product or related substances and reagents necessary to perform analyses of finished product as described in that dossier. The content and format of the dossier must follow rules as defined by the competent authorities. For example, since 2003, the authorities in the United States, the European Union and Japan ask for the Common Technical Document (CTD) format, and more recently, its electronic version – the electronic Common Technical Document (eCTD).\n\nThe application is filed with the competent drug regulatory authority in the concerned country, which can be either an independent regulatory body or a specialized department in the ministry of health.\n\nIn accordance with local legislation, the resulting document allowing to the applicant to market the product may be more detailed (in addition to data identifying the product and its marketing authorization holder) it may contain addresses of all manufacturing sites, appended labeling, artwork of packaging components, etc.) until a one-page document called certificate of registration (and containing minimal data identifying the product and its source). \n\nAuthorization processes follow either a purely national procedure, with rules and requirements as per national legislation in force, as it occurs in most of countries worldwide, or should follow a centrally approval or a mutual recognition or decentralized procedure within the European Union. In the European Union a new authorization process is being defined for the Identification of medicinal products (IDMP) (as of 2017) based on the article 40 of the Pharmacovigilance Implementing Measures.\n\nThe type of application may vary according to status of the active ingredient.\n\nThus, if the application concerns a new active ingredient (new active substance, new chemical entity, new molecular entity), one talks about a full application.\n\nOnce a new active ingredient authorized, any additional strengths, pharmaceutical forms, administration routes, presentations, as well as any variations (changes to the existing marketing authorization) and extensions shall also be granted an authorization or be included in the initial marketing authorization, being subject of an abridged application.\n\nSpecial consideration is to be given to application for authorization of biological products and biotechnology products, homeopathic products, herbal drugs, radionuclide generators, kits, radionuclide precursor radiopharmaceuticals and industrially prepared radiopharmaceuticals; in such instances, requirements are specific, in the meaning that they are special, more or less detailed, as per the nature of active ingredient.\n\nIn most countries, a marketing authorization is valid for a period of 5 years. After this period, one should apply for renewal of the marketing authorization, usually by providing minimal data proving that quality, efficacy and safety characteristics are maintained and the risk-benefit ratio of the medicinal product is still favourable. However, in the European Union, after one renewal, the marketing authorization shall remain valid for an unlimited period, unless the competent regulatory authority decides otherwise.\n\nIf the marketing authorization is not renewed in due time as requested by the local legislation, in order to maintain the pharmaceutical product on a market, one can apply for re-authorization (re-registration). In such situations, the applicant may be requested to submit the whole items necessary for a full application.\n\nMarketing authorization may be withdrawn, suspended, revoked or varied by regulatory authorities if under normal conditions of use the benefit over risk ratio is no more favorable, the product is harmful, or if it lacks therapeutic efficacy; also, one of the above actions can be taken if the qualitative and quantitative composition or other qualitative aspects (control) are not as currently declared.\n\nMarketing authorization may be also withdrawn, suspended or revoked if the marketing authorization holder or its representative does not fulfill other legal or regulatory obligations necessary to maintaining of product on the market, as per the legislation in force.\n\nAlso, the marketing authorization is withdrawn in the EU if the product is not placed on the market within next 3 consecutive years after granting of authorization or if it is no more marketed for 3 consecutive years (so-called “sunset clause”).\n\nEuropean Medicines Agency (EMA) IDMP Landingpage\nMarketing Authorization Holder Drug Dictionaries pharmazie.com\n"}

{"id": "42676", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=42676", "title": "Mold health issues", "text": "Mold health issues\n\nMold health issues are potentially harmful effects of molds.\n\nMolds (US usage; British English \"moulds\") are ubiquitous in the biosphere, and mold spores are a common component of household and workplace dust. The United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported in its June 2006 report, 'Mold Prevention Strategies and Possible Health Effects in the Aftermath of Hurricanes and Major Floods,' that \"excessive exposure to mold-contaminated materials can cause adverse health effects in susceptible persons regardless of the type of mold or the extent of contamination.\" When mold spores are present in abnormally high quantities, they can present especially hazardous health risks to humans after prolonged exposure, including allergic reactions or poisoning by mycotoxins, or causing fungal infection (mycosis).\n\nStudies have shown that people who are atopic (sensitive), already suffer from allergies, asthma, or compromised immune systems and occupy damp or moldy buildings are at an increased risk of health problems such as inflammatory and toxic responses to mold spores, metabolites and other components. The most common health problem is an allergic reaction. Other problems are respiratory and/or immune system responses including respiratory symptoms, respiratory infections, exacerbation of asthma, and rarely hypersensitivity pneumonitis, allergic alveolitis, chronic rhinosinusitis and allergic fungal sinusitis. Severe reactions are rare but possible. A person's reaction to mold depends on their sensitivity and other health conditions, the amount of mold present, length of exposure and the type of mold or mold products.\n\nSome molds also produce mycotoxins that can pose serious health risks to humans and animals. The term \"toxic mold\" refers to molds that produce mycotoxins, such as \"Stachybotrys chartarum\", not to all molds. Exposure to high levels of mycotoxins can lead to neurological problems and in some cases death. Prolonged exposure, e.g., daily workplace exposure, can be particularly harmful.\n\nThe five most common genera of indoor molds are \"Cladosporium\", \"Penicillium\", \"Aspergillus\", \"Alternaria\" and \"Trichoderma\".\n\nDamp environments which allow mold to grow can also produce bacteria and help release volatile organic compounds.\n\nSymptoms of mold exposure can include:\n\n\nInfants may develop respiratory symptoms as a result of exposure to a specific type of fungal mold, called Penicillium. Signs that an infant may have mold-related respiratory problems include (but are not limited to) a persistent cough and/or wheeze. Increased exposure increases the probability of developing respiratory symptoms during their first year of life. Studies have shown that a correlation exists between the probability of developing asthma and increased exposure to \"Penicillium\". The levels are deemed ‘no mold’ to ‘low level’, from ‘low’ to ‘intermediate’, and from ‘intermediate’ to ‘high’.\n\nMold exposures have a variety of health effects depending on the person. Some people are more sensitive to mold than others. Exposure to mold can cause a number of health issues such as; throat irritation, nasal stuffiness, eye irritation, cough and wheezing, as well as skin irritation in some cases. Exposure to mold may also cause heightened sensitivity depending on the time and nature of exposure. People at higher risk for mold allergies are people with chronic lung illnesses, which will result in more severe reactions when exposed to mold.\n\nThere has been sufficient evidence that damp indoor environments are correlated with upper respiratory tract symptoms such as coughing, and wheezing in people with asthma.\n\nAmong children and adolescents, the most common health effect post-flooding was lower respiratory tract symptoms though there was a lack of association with measurements of total fungi. Another study found that these respiratory symptoms were positively associated with exposure to water damaged homes, exposure included being inside without participating in clean up. Despite lower respiratory effects among all children, there was a significant difference in health outcomes between children with pre-existing conditions and children without. Children with pre-existing conditions were at greater risk that can likely be attributed to the greater disruption of care in the face of flooding and natural disaster. Health effects in children and adolescents with chronic risk were also found to be at an increased risk of adverse outcomes following a natural disaster including diabetes, asthma, chronic lung disease, allergies, HIV/AIDS, other immune disease, heart defects, cystic fibrosis, depression, seizure disorders, Sickle Cell disease, kidney failure, and liver failure.\n\nAlthough mold is the primary focus post flooding for residents, the effects of dampness alone must also be considered. According to the Institute of Medicine, there is a significant association between dampness in the home and wheeze, cough, and upper respiratory symptoms. A later analysis determined that 30% to 50% of asthma-related health outcomes are associated with not only mold, but also dampness in buildings. Another health effect associated with dampness and mold is Sick Building Syndrome (SBS), which is defined by manifestations of symptomatic illness as a result of poor indoor air quality and pollutant exposures . Signs of potentially illness-causing buildings include condensation on the windows, high humidity in the bathrooms, a moldy odor, or water leakage.\n\nWhile there is a proven correlation between mold exposure and the development of upper and lower respiratory syndromes, there are still fewer incidences of negative health effect than one might expect. Barbeau and colleagues suggested that studies do not show a greater impact from mold exposure for a number of reasons: 1) the types of health effects are not severe and are therefore not caught; 2) people whose homes have flooded find alternative housing to prevent exposure; 3) self-selection, the healthier people participated in mold clean-up and were less likely to get sick; 4) exposures were time-limited as result of remediation efforts and; 5) the lack of access to health care post-flooding may result in fewer illnesses being discovered and reported for their association with mold. There are also certain notable scientific limitations in studying the exposure effects of molds on individuals because there are currently no known biomarkers that can prove that a person has been exposed to molds. Thus, it is currently impossible to prove correlation between mold exposure and symptoms.\n\nHealth problems associated with high levels of airborne mold spores include allergic reactions, asthma episodes, irritations of the eye, nose and throat, sinus congestion, and other respiratory problems, although it should be noted that mold spores won't actually cause asthma, just irritate existing conditions. For example, residents of homes with mold are at an elevated risk for both respiratory infections and bronchitis. When mold spores are inhaled by an immunocompromised individual, some mold spores may begin to grow on living tissue, attaching to cells along the respiratory tract and causing further problems. Generally, when this occurs, the illness is an epiphenomenon and not the primary pathology. Also, mold may produce mycotoxins, either before or after exposure to humans, potentially causing toxicity.\n\nA serious health threat from mold exposure for immunocompromised individuals is systemic fungal infection (systemic mycosis). Immunocompromised individuals exposed to high levels of mold, or individuals with chronic exposure may become infected. Sinuses and digestive tract infections are most common; lung and skin infections are also possible. Mycotoxins may or may not be produced by the invading mold.\n\nDermatophytes are the parasitic fungi that cause skin infections such as athlete's foot and tinea cruris. Most dermataphyte fungi take the form of a mold, as opposed to a yeast, with appearance (when cultured) that is similar to other molds.\n\nOpportunistic infection by molds such as \"Penicillium marneffei\" and \"Aspergillus fumigatus\" is a common cause of illness and death among immunocompromised people, including people with AIDS or asthma.\n\nThe most common form of hypersensitivity is caused by the direct exposure to inhaled mold spores that can be dead or alive or hyphal fragments which can lead to allergic asthma or allergic rhinitis. The most common effects are rhinorrhea (runny nose), watery eyes, coughing and asthma attacks. Another form of hypersensitivity is hypersensitivity pneumonitis. Exposure can occur at home, at work or in other settings. It is predicted that about 5% of people have some airway symptoms due to allergic reactions to molds in their lifetimes.\n\nHypersensitivity may also be a reaction toward an established fungal infection in allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis.\n\nMolds excrete toxic compounds called mycotoxins, secondary metabolites produced by fungi under certain environmental conditions. These environmental conditions affect the production of mycotoxins at the transcription level. Temperature, water activity and pH, strongly influence mycotoxin biosynthesis by increasing the level of transcription within the fungal spore. It has also been found that low levels of fungicides can boost mycotoxin synthesis. Certain mycotoxins can be harmful or lethal to humans and animals when exposure is high enough.\n\nExtreme exposure to very high levels of mycotoxins can lead to neurological problems and in some cases death; fortunately, such exposures rarely to never occur in normal exposure scenarios, even in residences with serious mold problems. Prolonged exposure, such as daily workplace exposure, can be particularly harmful.\n\nThe health hazards produced by mold have been associated with sick building syndrome, but no validated studies have been able to demonstrate that normal indoor exposures to these common organisms pose a significant threat.\n\nIt is thought that all molds may produce mycotoxins and thus all molds may be potentially toxic if large enough quantities are ingested, or the human becomes exposed to extreme quantities of mold. Mycotoxins are not produced all the time, but only under specific growing conditions. Mycotoxins are harmful or lethal to humans and animals only when exposure is high enough, as with absolutely all other substances.\n\nMycotoxins can be found on the mold spore and mold fragments, and therefore they can also be found on the substrate upon which the mold grows. Routes of entry for these insults can include ingestion, dermal exposure and inhalation.\n\nSome mycotoxins cause immune system responses that vary considerably, depending on the individual. The duration of exposure, the frequency of exposure and the concentration of the insult (exposure) are elements in triggering immune system response.\n\nAflatoxin is an example of a mycotoxin. It is a cancer-causing poison produced by certain fungi in or on foods and feeds, especially in field corn and peanuts.\n\nOriginally, toxic effects from mold were thought to be the result of exposure to the mycotoxins of some mold species, such as \"Stachybotrys chartarum\". However, studies are suggesting that the so-called toxic effects are actually the result of chronic activation of the immune system, leading to chronic inflammation. Studies indicate that up to 25% of the population have the genetic capability of experiencing chronic inflammation to mold exposure, but it is unknown how many actually experience such symptoms due to frequent misdiagnosis. A 1993–94 case study based on cases of pulmonary hemorrhage in infants in Cleveland, Ohio originally concluded there was causal relationship between the exposure and the disease. The investigators revisited the cases and established that there was no link to the exposure to \"S. chartrum\" and the infants in their homes.\n\nThe common house mold, \"Trichoderma longibrachiatum\", produces small toxic peptides containing amino acids not found in common proteins, like alpha-aminoisobutyric acid, called trilongins (up to 10% w/w). Their toxicity is due to absorption into cells and production of nano-channels that obstruct vital ion channels that ferry potassium and sodium ions across the cell membrane. This affects in the cells action potential profile, as seen in cardiomyocytes, pneumocytes and neurons leading to conduction defects. Trilongins are highly resistant to heat and antimicrobials making primary prevention the only management option.\n\nThe main sources of mold exposure are from the indoor air in buildings with substantial mold growth, and from ingestion of food with mold growths.\n\nPrevention of mold exposure and its ensuing health issues begins with prevention of mold growth in the first place by avoiding a mold-supporting environment such as humid air. Extensive flooding and water damage can support extensive mold growth. Following hurricanes, homes with greater flood damage, especially those with more than of indoor flooding, demonstrated higher levels of mold growth compared with homes with little or no flooding. The aftermath of a hurricane is the worst-case scenario, but the concept of water damage supporting widespread mold growth is more generally applicable.\n\nIt is useful to perform an assessment of the location and extent of the mold hazard in a structure. Various practices of remediation can be followed to mitigate mold issues in buildings, the most important of which is to reduce moisture levels. Removal of affected materials after the source of moisture has been reduced and/or eliminated may be necessary. Thus, the concept of mold growth, assessment, and remediation is essential in prevention of mold health issues.\n\nA common issue with mold hazards in the household is the placement of furniture, and the lack of ventilation which this causes to certain parts of the wall. The simplest method of avoiding mold in a home so affected is to move the furniture in question.\n\nAdverse respiratory health effects are associated with occupancy in buildings with moisture and mold damage.\n\nMolds may excrete liquids or low-volatility gases, but the concentrations are so low that frequently they cannot be detected even with sensitive analytical sampling techniques. Sometimes these by-products are detectable by odor, in which case they are referred to as \"ergonomic odors\" meaning the odors are detectable, but do not indicate toxicologically significant exposures.\n\nMolds that are often found on meat and poultry include members of the genera \"Alternaria\", \"Aspergillus\", \"Botrytis\", \"Cladosporium\", \"Fusarium\", \"Geotrichum\", \"Mortierella\", \"Mucor\", \"Neurospora\", \"Paecilomyces\", \"Penicillium\", and \"Rhizopus\". Grain crops in particular incur considerable losses both in field and storage due to pathogens, post-harvest spoilage, and insect damage. A number of common microfungi are important agents of post-harvest spoilage, notably members of the genera \"Aspergillus\", \"Fusarium\", and \"Penicillium\". A number of these produce mycotoxins (soluble, non-volatile toxins produced by a range of microfungi that demonstrate specific and potent toxic properties on human and animal cells) that can render foods unfit for consumption. When ingested, inhaled, or absorbed through skin, mycotoxins may cause or contribute to a range of effects from reduced appetite and general malaise to acute illness or death in rare cases. Mycotoxins may also contribute to cancer. Dietary exposure to the mycotoxin aflatoxin B1, commonly produced by growth of the fungus \"Aspergillus flavus\" on improperly stored ground nuts in many areas of the developing world, is known to independently (and synergistically with Hepatitis B virus) induce liver cancer. Mycotoxin-contaminated grain and other food products have a significant impact on human and animal health globally. According to the World Health Organization, roughly 25% of the world's food may be contaminated by mycotoxins.\n\nPrevention of mold exposure from food is generally to consume food that has no mold growths on it. Also, mold growth in the first place can be prevented by the same concept of mold growth, assessment, and remediation that prevents air exposure. In addition, it is especially useful to clean the inside of the refrigerator, and to ensure dishcloths, towels, sponges and mops are clean.\n\nRuminants are considered to have increased resistance to some mycotoxins, presumably due to the superior mycotoxin-degrading capabilities of their gut microbiota. The passage of mycotoxins through the food chain may also have important consequences on human health. For example, in China in December 2011, high levels of carcinogen aflatoxin M1 in Mengniu brand milk were found to be associated with the consumption of mold-contaminated feed by dairy cattle.\n\nOver 47 species have been identified in pillows.\n\nFlooding in houses causes a unique opportunity for mold growth which may be attributed to adverse health effects in people exposed to the mold, especially children and adolescents. In a study on the health effects of mold exposure after hurricanes Katrina and Rita, the predominant types of mold were \"Aspergillus, Penicillum\", and \"Cladosporium\" with indoor spore counts ranging from 6,142 – 735,123 spores m. Molds isolated following flooding were different from mold previously reported for non-water damaged homes in the area. Further research found that homes with greater than three feet of indoor flooding demonstrated significantly higher levels of mold than those with little or no flooding.\n\nRecommended strategies to prevent mold include: avoiding mold-contamination; utilization of environmental controls; the use of personal protective equipment (PPE) including skin and eye protection and respiratory protection; and environmental controls such as ventilation and suppression of dust. When mold cannot be prevented, the CDC recommends clean-up protocol including first taking emergency action to stop water intrusion. Second, they recommend determining the extent of water damage and mold contamination. And third, they recommend planning remediation activities such as establishing containment and protection for workers and occupants; eliminating water or moisture sources if possible; decontaminating or removing damaged materials and drying any wet materials; evaluating whether the space has been successfully remediated; and reassembling the space to control sources of moisture.\n\nIn the 1930s, mold was identified as the cause behind the mysterious deaths of farm animals in Russia and other countries. \"Stachybotrys chartarum\" was found growing on wet grain used for animal feed. Illness and death also occurred in humans when starving peasants ate large quantities of rotten food grains and cereals that were heavily overgrown with the \"Stachybotrys\" mold.\n\nIn the 1970s, building construction techniques changed in response to changing economic realities including the energy crisis. As a result, homes and buildings became more airtight. Also, cheaper materials such as drywall came into common use. The newer building materials reduced the drying potential of the structures making moisture problems more prevalent. This combination of increased moisture and suitable substrates contributed to increased mold growth inside buildings.\n\nToday, the US Food and Drug Administration and the agriculture industry closely monitor mold and mycotoxin levels in grains and foodstuffs in order to keep the contamination of animal feed and human food supplies below specific levels. In 2005 Diamond Pet Foods, a US pet food manufacturer, experienced a significant rise in the number of corn shipments containing elevated levels of aflatoxin. This mold toxin eventually made it into the pet food supply, and dozens of dogs and cats died before the company was forced to recall affected products.\n\nIn 2002, the U.S. International Trade Commission reported that according to one estimate, US insurers paid over $3 billion in mold-related lawsuits, more than double the previous year's total. According to the Insurance Information Institute, in 2003 there were over 10,000 mold-related lawsuits pending in US state courts. Most were filed in states with high humidity, but suits were on the rise in other states as well. By 2004, many mold litigation settlements were for amounts well past $100,000. In 2005, the U.S. International Trade Commission reported that toxic mold showed signs of being the \"new asbestos\" in terms of claims paid. In 2012, a key appellate court in Manhattan found a consensus in the scientific literature for a causal relationship between the presence of mold and resultant illness.\n\nIn 1999, an Austin, Texas, woman was awarded $32 million when she sued her insurer over mold damage in her 22-room mansion.\n\nIn 2001, a jury awarded a couple and their eight-year-old son $2.7 million, plus attorney’s fees and costs, in a toxic mold-related personal injury lawsuit against the owners and managers of their apartment in Sacramento, California.\n\nIn 2003, \"The Tonight Show\" co-host Ed McMahon received $7.2 million from insurers and others to settle his lawsuit alleging that toxic mold in his Beverly Hills home made him and his wife ill and killed their dog. That same year environmental activist Erin Brockovich received settlements of $430,000 from two parties and an undisclosed amount from a third party to settle her lawsuit alleging toxic mold in her Agoura Hills, California, home.\n\nIn 2006, a Manhattan Beach, California family received a $22.6 million settlement in a toxic mold case. The family had asserted that that moldy lumber had caused severe medical problems in their child. That same year, Hilton Hotels received $25 million in settlement of its lawsuit over mold growth in the Hilton Hawaiian Village's Kalia Tower.\n\nIn 2010, a jury awarded $1.2 million in damages in a lawsuit against a landlord for neglecting to repair a mold-infested house in Laguna Beach, California. The lawsuit asserted that a child in the home suffered from severe respiratory problems for several years as a result of the mold.\n\nIn 2011, in North Pocono, Pennsylvania, a jury awarded two homeowners $4.3 million in a toxic mold verdict.\n\nWhile there is a national policy regarding mold, each state is responsible for independently creating and administering their own policy. For example, following Hurricane Harvey, the governor of Texas sought to expand the emergency response to allow mold remediation companies to come from out of state.\n\n\n"}

The name PIMEX is an acronym from the words PIcture Mix EXposure, and implies that the method is based on mixing pictures, in this case from a video camera, with data on a worker’s exposure to some agent. The main idea of the method is to make invisible hazards in the work environment visible and in this manner facilitate the reduction of hazards in workplaces.\n\nThe method PIMEX was originally developed in Sweden during the 1980s by Gunnar Rosén and Ing-Marie Andersson. Similar technique was developed also in USA where NIOSH researchers described a technique using a video overlay board and computer program to display, in real-time or after recording of data and video on tape, the measured value as a bar graph and the picture on the computer screen. \n\nVideo exposure monitoring has thereafter been further developed and used in a number of countries.\n\nThe workers’ knowledge of risks associated with their tasks and, perhaps more importantly, how these risks can be controlled, is essential to improve their health. Applications of the PIMEX methods are various, focusing on work task analysis, training and risk communication, encouraging worker participation in and motivation for improvements in the workplace environment.\n\nPIMEX is used in many different countries. It is a widely used in the Netherlands for risk communication in the field of chemical exposure and it has been proven to be a very strong communication tool. There are more than 100 professional videos made with PIMEx for many different industries. They are all free available. The Dutch Ministry of social affairs developed a new promo video of PIMEX. It demonstrates the function and use of PIMEX with various examples from working environments.\n\nThere are a number of situations where PIMEX has been used:\n\n\nIn the Netherlands, the method is available to small and medium enterprises by the use of a half day workplace analysis or simple videos can be made.\n\nPIMEX is also used to visualize noise, heat stress, nanoparticles, electromagnetic fields and physical load. In the Netherlands there are also videos available that are made for employees in health services who are working with a mobile patient hoist. Such mobile hoists are used to reduce physical overload. The video shows the difference in exposure between using the hoist in the wrong and the correct way, for example when the wheels are in the wrong or right position.\n\n"}

The purpose of the database is to make patient data readily available anywhere that the patient seeks treatment, for example if they are staying away from their home town or if they are unable to give information for themselves. Despite opposition from some quarters, by September 2010, 424 GP practices across at least 36 Primary Care Trusts had uploaded 2.7 million Summary Care Records. On 10 October 2010, the Health Secretary announced that the coalition government would continue with the introduction, but that the records would 'hold only the essential medical information needed in an emergency – that is medication, allergen and [drug] reactions'. By March 2013, more than 24 million SCRs had been created across England.\n\nAccess to data is available to NHS personnel anywhere in England, but only if they have had the correct access rights on their smartcard approved by senior management . Pharmacists in five regions were given read-only access in an NHS England pilot in October 2014 so they could verify and compare a patient's medicines during Medicine use reviews. Patients were able to view their own records via the HealthSpace website, which closed down in December 2012.\n\nThe initial content of the database was to include the following:\n\nIn his announcement on 10 October 2010, the Health Secretary implied that its scope would in future be restricted to these three items, stating but that it would 'hold only the essential medical information needed in an emergency – that is medication, allergen and [drug] reactions'.\nIt also stated however that additional information can be added at the specific request of the patient.\n\nIt was originally intended that the database system would be upgraded in the future to add:\n\nHowever, following the Government announcement in October 2010 this is no longer envisaged.\n\nInitial plans were that patients' records would be automatically be uploaded, without seeking patient consent. In December 2006, Sir Liam Donaldson, the Chief Medical Officer, wrote to GPs telling them that letters from patients requesting that their records should not be uploaded should be sent to Patricia Hewitt, the health secretary, for 'full consideration', causing consternation among privacy campaigners.\n\nAs a result of pressure from privacy campaigners, the British Medical Association (BMA), the Ethics Committee of the Royal College of General Practitioners, and a report by the Department of Health's 'patients tsar' Harry Cayton (the Report of the Ministerial Taskforce on the Summary Care Record), the Government agreed that patients would be able to opt out of the Summary Care Record.\n\nAfter further pressure, it was decided that patients would be contacted before records were uploaded to provide them with the opportunity to opt out. Unless the patient does explicitly opt-out within the specified period after being notified (12 weeks as of April 2010), their details will be uploaded. Once entered \"and\" viewed, records cannot be fully deleted.\n\nA number of pilot schemes followed, in the Primary Care Trusts areas of Bolton, Bury, South Birmingham, Dorset, South West Essex, and Bradford & Airedale. In response to a Freedom of Information Request, the Department of Health revealed that, as at 24 April 2009, 258,488 patients' clinical records had been updated to form Summary Care Records. The Department was unable to provide information on how many of these related to children.\n\nProblems with the opting out scheme were reported by the independent evaluation, published 2010. In September 2010 it was reported that the opt-out rate had risen from 0.6% to nearly 1%\n\nBy the end of 2009 five strategic health authorities - NHS North West, NHS North East, NHS Yorkshire and the Humber, NHS London and NHS East of England - had announced that they would begin notifying patients and uploading records during 2010. The Department of Health agreed to make funding available to them within the 2009-2010 financial year for public information campaigns. By 18 March 2010 letters had been sent to at least some patients notifying them that their details were to be entered unless they opted out within 12 weeks.\n\nOn 16 April 2010 the Department of Health suspended the implementation of Summary Care Records in the areas leading the roll-out, following calls to do so by the British Medical Association. The BMA believed that implementation was moving forward too rapidly, that patients did not have enough information, and that it was too hard for them to opt out. A week later it was reported that several Primary Care Trusts and the NHS East of England Strategic Health Authority were seeking a dispensation to continue with their implementation.\n\nIn August 2015 it was announced that retail pharmacies would be given access to NHS patients Summary Care Records after a pilot of 140 pharmacies in Somerset, Northampton, North Derbyshire, Sheffield and West Yorkshire, demonstrated “significant benefits.” Pharmacists have to ask for a patient’s permission to view their record, and are required to complete the relevant Centre for Pharmacy Postgraduate Education e-learning package.\n\nIn 2018 information on long-term health conditions, medical history and immunisations was available, and according to NHS Digital, this reduced the burden on the health service during winter.\n\nA concern that has been raised is that surveys have shown that most patients know nothing of the SCR scheme even if they have received leaflets, so that when people receive a package on the SCR it goes straight in the bin as junk mail.\n\nIn March 2010 the British Medical Association asked the British Government to suspend the roll-out of the database as it was an \"imperfect system\" being rushed into service prematurely, amid accusations that the system is insecure and that data has been uploaded without giving patients the opportunity to opt out.\n\nThe system has also been criticized for its inability to delete a patient record if a patient decides to withdraw from the system once their record has been created AND viewed. This has been stated to be due to the cost of completely deleting all information: \"complete removal would require the hardware holding records to be completely sanitised. This is a process that destroys all data held, for example on a server or hard drive, and not just a particular record\" and that in any case the record needs to be retained for legal reasons as \"The issue of audit and the medico-legal evidential significance of the SCR will be extremely important and it would be inappropriate to provide tools that could completely remove a record, even if this were feasible.\"\n\nSystmOne and other GP systems provide much more detailed information than the Summary Care Record. The implementation of SystmOne Prison across the prison estate \"should be taken as a sign that a more widespread system is easily achievable\".\n\n"}

It was originally called systemic-onset juvenile rheumatoid arthritis or Still's disease.\n\nPredominantly extra-articular manifestations like high fevers, rheumatic rash, enlargement of the liver and spleen, enlargement of the lymph nodes, and anemia. Others manifestations include inflammation of the pleura, inflammation of the pericardium, inflammation of the heart's muscular tissue, and inflammation of the peritoneum are also seen.\n\nIt is sometimes called \"juvenile-onset Still's disease\", to distinguish it from adult-onset Still's disease. However, there is some evidence that the two conditions are closely related.\n\nSystemic JIA is characterized by arthritis, fever, which typically is higher than the low-grade fever associated with polyarticular and a salmon pink rash. It accounts for 10-20% of JIA and affects males and females equally, unlike the other two subtypes of JIA, and affects adolescents. It generally involves both large and small joints. Systemic JIA can be challenging to diagnose because the fever and rash come and go. Fever can occur at the same time every day or twice a day (often in late afternoon or evening) with a spontaneous rapid return to baseline (vs. septic arthritis of continuous fever). The rash often occurs with fever. It is a discrete, salmon-pink macules of different sizes. It migrates to different locations on skin, rarely persisting in one location more than one hour. The rash is commonly seen on trunk and proximal extremities or over pressure areas.\n\nArthritis is often absent in the first weeks or even 6–8 months into the illness.\n\nSystemic JIA may have internal organ involvement such as hepatosplenomegaly, lymphadenopathy, serositis, hepatitis, or tenosynovitis.\n\nA polymorphism in macrophage migration inhibitory factor has been associated with this condition.\nThe cause is unknown but it's thought to be related to environmental, genetic, and hormonal factors.\n\nRheumatoid factor and ANA tests are generally negative in systemic JIA.\nLab findings: anemia of chronic disease, neutrophilia, thrombocytosis, elevated acute phase reactants (ESR, CRP, ferritin).\n\nTreatment with either glucocorticoids, methotrexate, anakinra, or tocilizumab has been examined. Anakinra has been shown to resolve the clinical features of the disease in 87% of patients. It also induces remission in half of corticosteroid-resistant patients. The results of another study were similar, with half of the patients responding to treatment with Anakinra. Canakinumab, an antibody to \ninterleukin-1 beta, is indicated for treatment in patients who respond poorly to other treatments.\n\n25% of cases progress to severe destructive arthritis. In the United States and Canada, mortality is estimated at about 4% and in Europe, mortality is estimated at 21.7%.\n\nStill's disease is named after English physician Sir George Frederic Still (1861–1941). It was characterized by EG Bywaters in 1971.\n"}
{"id": "1725093", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1725093", "title": "Tiber Island", "text": "Tiber Island\n\nThe Tiber Island (, Latin: \"Insula Tiberina\") is the only island in the part of the Tiber which runs through Rome. Tiber Island is located in the southern bend of the Tiber.\n\nThe island is boat-shaped, approximately long and wide, and has been connected with bridges to both sides of the river since antiquity. Being a seat of the ancient temple of Asclepius and later a hospital, the island is associated with medicine and healing. The Fatebenefratelli Hospital founded in the 16th century, and the Basilica of St. Bartholomew on the Island dating from the 10th century are located on the island.\n\nThe island has been linked to the rest of Rome by two bridges since antiquity, and was once called \"Insula Inter-Duos-Pontes\" which means \"the island between the two bridges\". The Ponte Fabricio, the only original bridge in Rome, connects the island from the northeast to the Field of Mars in the rione Sant'Angelo (left bank). The Ponte Cestio, of which only some original parts survived, connects the island to Trastevere on the south (right bank).\n\nThere is a legend which says that after the fall of the hated tyrant Tarquinius Superbus (510 BC), the angry Romans threw his body into the Tiber. His body then settled onto the bottom where dirt and silt accumulated around it and eventually formed Tiber Island. Another version of the legend says that the people gathered up the wheat and grain of their despised ruler and threw it into the Tiber, where it eventually became the foundation of the island.\n\nIn ancient times, before Christianity spread through Rome, Tiber Island was avoided because of the negative stories associated with it. Only the worst criminals and the contagiously ill were condemned there. This however changed when a temple was built on the island.\n\nTiber Island was once the location of an ancient temple to Aesculapius, the Greek god of medicine and healing.\n\nAccounts say that in 293 BC, there was a great plague in Rome. Upon consulting the Sibyl, the Roman Senate was instructed to build a temple to Aesculapius, the Greek god of healing, and sent a delegation to Epidauros to obtain a statue of the deity. The delegation went on board a ship to sail out and obtain a statue.\n\nFollowing their belief system, they obtained a snake from a temple and put it on board their ship. It immediately curled itself around the ship's mast and this was deemed as a good sign by them. Upon their return up the Tiber river, the snake slithered off the ship and swam onto the island. They believed that this was a sign from Aesculapius, a sign which meant that he wanted his temple to be built on that island.\n\nThis location may have been chosen for the Aesculapius Temple because it was separate from the rest of the city, which could help protect whoever was there from plague and illnesses.\n\nThe island eventually became so identified with the temple it supported that it was modeled to resemble a ship as a reminder of how it came to be. Travertine facing was added in mid or late first century by the banks to resemble a ship's prow and stern, and an obelisk was erected in the middle, symbolizing the vessel's mast. Walls were put around the island, and it came to resemble a Roman ship. Faint vestiges of Aesculapius' rod with an entwining snake are still visible on the \"prow\".\n\nAfter the Temple of Aesculapius, shrines dedicated to other deities were also erected after the 2nd century BC, namely:\n\nIn time, the obelisk was removed and replaced with a cross-topped column. After it was destroyed in 1867, Pope Pius IX had an aedicula, called \"Spire\", put in its place. This monument, designed by Ignazio Jacometti, is decorated with statues of four saints related to the island: St. Bartholomew, St. Paulinus of Nola, St. Francis and St. John. Parts of the obelisk are now in the museum in Naples.\n\nIn 998 Emperor Otto III had a basilica, that of San Bartolomeo all'Isola, built over the Aesculapius temple's ruins on the eastern side (downstream end) of the island. This was dedicated to his friend, the martyr Adalbert of Prague; the name of St. Bartholomew was added only later. In the early 20th century, prior to the Fascist regime's restoration of ancient place names, the Tiber Island was called the Isola di S. Bartolomeo. Likewise, Cestius' Bridge was called the Ponte S. Bartolomeo.\n\nThe island is still considered a place of healing because a hospital, founded in 1584, was built on the island and is still operating. It is staffed by the Hospitaller Order of St. John of God or \"Fatebenefratelli\". The hospital was not built on the same spot as the temple, but stands on the western half of the island.\n\nAccording to the documentary My Italian Secret, when the Nazis occupied Rome in 1943 and started rounding up the Jews, Dr. Borromeo, head of the hospital, invented a “deadly” and highly contagious illness he dubbed “Il Morbo di K” to keep the SS away and protect those Jews hiding inside the wards, just a stone’s throw from the Ghetto. \n\nDuring summer, the island hosts the \"Isola del Cinema\" film festival.\n\nThe island serves as the player's headquarters in the 2010 action-adventure stealth video game \"\".\n\n"}
{"id": "3006020", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=3006020", "title": "Tobacco Master Settlement Agreement", "text": "Tobacco Master Settlement Agreement\n\nThe Tobacco Master Settlement Agreement (MSA) was entered in November 1998, originally between the four largest United States tobacco companies (Philip Morris Inc., R. J. Reynolds, Brown & Williamson and Lorillard – the \"original participating manufacturers\", referred to as the \"Majors\") and the attorneys general of 46 states. The states settled their Medicaid lawsuits against the tobacco industry for recovery of their tobacco-related health-care costs. In exchange, the companies agreed to curtail or cease certain tobacco marketing practices, as well as to pay, in perpetuity, various annual payments to the states to compensate them for some of the medical costs of caring for persons with smoking-related illnesses. The money also funds a new anti-smoking advocacy group, called the Truth Initiative, that is responsible for such campaigns as Truth. The settlement also dissolved the tobacco industry groups Tobacco Institute, the Center for Indoor Air Research, and the Council for Tobacco Research. In the MSA, the original participating manufacturers (OPM) agreed to pay a minimum of $206 billion over the first 25 years of the agreement.\n\nIn September 1950, an article was published in the \"British Medical Journal\" linking smoking to lung cancer and heart disease. In 1954 the British Doctors Study confirmed the suggestion, based on which the government issued advice that smoking and lung cancer rates were related. In 1964 the United States Surgeon General's Report on Smoking and Health likewise began suggesting the relationship between smoking and cancer.\n\nBy the mid-1950s, individuals in the United States began to sue the companies responsible for manufacturing and marketing cigarettes for damages related to the effects of smoking. In the forty years through 1994, over 800 private claims were brought against tobacco companies in state courts across the country. The individuals asserted claims for negligent manufacture, negligent advertising, fraud, and violation of various state consumer protection statutes. The tobacco companies were successful against these lawsuits. Only two plaintiffs ever prevailed, and both of those decisions were reversed on appeal. As scientific evidence mounted in the 1980s, tobacco companies claimed contributory negligence as the adverse health effects were previously unknown or lacked substantial credibility.\n\nIn the mid 1990s, more than 40 states commenced litigation against the tobacco industry, seeking monetary, equitable, and injunctive relief under various consumer-protection and antitrust laws. The first was declared in May 1994 by Mississippi Attorney General Mike Moore.\n\nThe general theory of these lawsuits was that the cigarettes produced by the tobacco industry contributed to health problems among the population, which in turn resulted in significant costs to the states' public health systems. As Moore declared, \"'[The] lawsuit is premised on a simple notion: you caused the health crisis; you pay for it.'\" The states alleged a wide range of deceptive and fraudulent practices by the tobacco companies over decades of sales. Other states soon followed. The state lawsuits sought recovery for Medicaid and other public health expenses incurred in the treatment of smoking-induced illnesses. Importantly, the defenses of personal responsibility that were so effective for the tobacco industry in suits by private individuals were inapplicable to the causes of action alleged by the states.\n\nFaced with the prospect of defending multiple actions nationwide, the Majors sought a congressional remedy, primarily in the form of a national legislative settlement. In June 1997, the National Association of Attorneys General and the Majors jointly petitioned Congress for a global resolution. On June 20, 1997, Mississippi Attorney General Michael Moore and a group of other attorneys general announced the details of the settlement. The settlement included a payment by the companies of $365.5 billion, agreement to possible Food and Drug Administration regulation under certain circumstances, and stronger warning labels and restrictions on advertising. In exchange the companies would be freed from class-action suits and litigation costs would be capped.\n\nThis proposed congressional remedy (1997 National Settlement Proposal (NSP), a.k.a. the \"June 20, 1997 Proposal\") for the cigarette tobacco problem resembled the eventual Multistate Settlement Agreement (MSA), but with important differences. For example, although the congressional proposal would have earmarked one-third of all funds to combat teenage smoking, no such restrictions appear in the MSA. In addition, the congressional proposal would have mandated Food and Drug Administration oversight and imposed federal advertising restrictions. It also would have granted immunity from state prosecutions; eliminated punitive damages in individual tort suits; and prohibited the use of class actions, or other joinder or aggregation devices without the defendant's consent, assuring that only individual actions could be brought. The congressional proposal called for payments to the states of $368.5 billion over 25 years. By contrast, assuming that the Majors would maintain their market share, the MSA provides baseline payments of about $200 billion over 25 years. This baseline payment is subject to\nThe attorneys general did not have the authority to grant all this by themselves: the Global Settlement Agreement would require an act of Congress. Senator John McCain of Arizona carried the bill, which was much more aggressive than even the global settlement. However, in the spring of 1998, Congress rejected both the proposed settlement and an alternative proposal submitted by McCain.\n\nWhile the proposed legislation was being discussed in Congress, some individual states began settling their litigation against the tobacco industry. On July 2, 1997, Mississippi became the first. Over the next year, Florida, Texas, and Minnesota followed, with the four states recovering a total of over $35 billion.\n\nFour states (Mississippi, Florida, Texas and Minnesota) settled with the OPMs before the MSA. The OPMs pay those four states (the \"previously settled states\") 17 per cent of the MSA per-cigarette payment amount for each cigarette sold in any state. Thus, the OPMs pay the settling and previously settled states 104.55 per cent of the per-cigarette amount for each cigarette sold. In 2005, OPM payments totaled about 2.2 cents per cigarette or 44 cents per box.\n\nIn November 1998, the Attorneys General of the remaining 46 states, as well as of the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, and the Virgin Islands, entered into the Master Settlement Agreement with the four largest manufacturers of cigarettes in the United States. (Florida, Minnesota, Texas and Mississippi had already reached individual agreements with the tobacco industry.) The four manufacturers—Philip Morris USA, R. J. Reynolds Tobacco Company, Brown & Williamson Tobacco Corp., and Lorillard Tobacco Company—are referred to in the MSA as the Original Participating Manufacturers (OPMs).\n\nThis settlement process yielded two other national agreements:\n\nIn the Smokeless Tobacco Master Settlement Agreement, which was executed at the same time as the Master Settlement Agreement, the leading manufacturer in the smokeless tobacco market (United States Tobacco Company, now known as U.S. Smokeless Tobacco Company) settled with the jurisdictions who signed the MSA, plus Minnesota and Mississippi.\n\nThe next year, the major cigarette manufacturers settled with the tobacco-growing states to compensate tobacco growers for losses they were expected to suffer due to the higher cigarette prices resulting from the earlier settlements. Called the \"Phase II\" settlement, this agreement created the National Tobacco Growers' Settlement Trust Fund. Tobacco growers and quota holders in the 14 states that grow flue-cured and burley tobacco used to manufacture cigarettes are eligible to receive payments from the trust fund. The states are Alabama, Florida, Georgia, Indiana, Kentucky, Maryland, Missouri, North Carolina, Ohio, Pennsylvania, South Carolina, Tennessee, Virginia, and West Virginia.\n\nAt the time the Master Settlement Agreement became effective, the OPMs collectively controlled approximately 97% of the domestic market for cigarettes. In addition to these \"originally settling parties\" (OSPs), the Master Settlement Agreement permits other tobacco companies to join the settlement; a list of these \"subsequently settling parties\" (SSPs) is maintained by the National Association of Attorneys General. Since 1998, approximately 41 additional tobacco companies have joined the Master Settlement Agreement. These companies, referred to as the Subsequent Participating Manufacturers (SPMs), are bound by the Master Settlement Agreement's restrictions and must make payments to the settling states as set forth in the Master Settlement Agreement. Collectively, the OPMs and the SPMs are referred to as the Participating Manufacturers (PMs). Any tobacco company choosing not to participate in the Master Settlement Agreement is referred to as a Nonparticipating Manufacturer (NPM).\n\nAs an incentive to join the Master Settlement Agreement, the agreement provides that, if an SPM joined within ninety days following the Master Settlement Agreement's \"Execution Date,\" that SPM is exempt (\"exempt SPM\") from making annual payments to the settling states unless the SPM increases its share of the national cigarette market beyond its 1998 market share, or beyond 125% of that SPM's 1997 market share. If the exempt SPM's market share in a given year increases beyond those relevant historic limits, the MSA requires that the exempt SPM make annual payments to the settling states, similar to those made by the OPMs, but based only upon the SPM's sales representing the exempt SPM's market share increase.\n\nSPMs joining the Master Settlement Agreement after this ninety-day exempt period must, instead, make annual payments based upon all of the SPM's national cigarette sales for a given year. In addition to its annual payment obligations, in order [**9] to join the Master Settlement Agreement now, a non-exempt SPM must, \"within a reasonable time after signing the\" Master Settlement Agreement, pay the amount it would have been obligated to pay under the Master Settlement Agreement during the time between the Master Settlement Agreement's effective date and the date on which the SPM joined the agreement.\n\nThe addition of the Subsequent Participating Manufacturers meant that nearly all of the cigarette producers in the domestic market had signed the Multistate Settlement Agreement. Their addition was significant. The Majors allegedly feared that any cigarette manufacturer left out of a settlement (Non-Participating Manufacturers or NPMs) would be free to expand market share or could enter the market with lower prices, drastically altering the Majors' future profits and their ability to increase prices to pay for the settlement.\n\nThe Original Participating Manufacturers (OPMs) agreed to several broad categories of conditions:\n\nA section on enforcement gave jurisdiction to individual state courts to implement and enforce the term, and established a state enforcement fund ($50 million one-time payment). The participating manufacturers also paid the states' Attorney Fees.\n\nGenerally, the participating manufacturers agreed not to \"take any action, directly or indirectly, to target Youth within any Settling State in the advertising, promotion or marketing of Tobacco Products, or take any action the primary purpose of which is to initiate, maintain or increase the incidence of Youth smoking within any Settling State.\" (§III(a))\n\nThe restrictions specified included bans on outdoor billboards, advertising on transit vehicles, as well as restrictions on sports marketing, event sponsorships and promotional products.\n\nStates were to receive over $206 billion over 25 years:\n\nThe amount of money that the PMs are required to annually contribute to the states varies according to several factors. All payments are based primarily on the number of cigarettes sold.\n\nFor the OPMs (Original Participating Manufacturers), the payments are determined in accordance with their relative market share as of 1997. The payment amount of a particular OPM is also dictated by the \"Volume Adjustment,\" which compares the number of cigarettes sold in each payment year to the number of cigarettes sold in 1997. If the number of cigarettes sold by an OPM in a given year is less than the number it sold in 1997, the Volume Adjustment allows that OPM to reduce its payment to the settling states. In other words, a reduction in the amount of cigarettes sold by the OPMs results in the settling states receiving less money.\n\nThe MSA sets forth specific amounts that the OPMs have agreed to pay the settling states each year. Those annual amounts are subject to a number of adjustments. The OPMs each pay a portion of the total annual payment according to each OPM's \"Relative Market Share\" for the preceding year.\n\nFor the SPMs (Subsequent Participating Manufacturers), the payments are determined by their relative market share as compared to other SPMs. For the SPMs that joined the MSA within 90 days of its execution, the annual payments are determined by the number of cigarettes an SPM sells beyond the \"grandfathered\" volume—calculated as the higher of either the individual SPM's market share in 1998 (the year the MSA was executed) or 125% of the SPM's market share in 1997. If an SPM's sales volume or market share declines below the grandfathered amount, then it is not required to make any payments to the settling states. SPMs that failed to join the MSA within 90 days of its execution do not receive the benefit of any grandfathered amount.\n\nBoth exempt and non-exempt SPMs' annual payment obligations under the MSA are \"calculated on the basis of the percentage of the four original participating manufacturers' total domestic market share represented by the SPM[s'] domestic market share . . . . In other words, the denominator in the calculation is the total OPM market share, not the total OPM and SPM market share.\" Furthermore, the parties agree that the amount the SPMs pay per cigarette is roughly the same as the per-cigarette amount that the OPMs pay under the MSA. To the extent the amount differs, the OPMs pay slightly more than the SPMs on a per cigarette basis.\n\nThe payments from all the PMs are deposited into an escrow account until disbursement to the settling states.\n\nThe MSA includes a model escrow (or qualifying) act and provides strong incentives for settling states to adopt it. \"[A] Qualifying Statute . . . is one that effectively and fully neutralizes the cost disadvantages that the Participating Manufacturers experience vis-a-vis Nonparticipating Manufacturers within the state.\"\n\nThe MSA encouraged settling states to adopt the model escrow act by providing that a settling state's allocated payment—that is, the portion of the annual MSA payment that a particular state receives in a given year—could be reduced by applying a non-participating manufacturers (\"NPM\") adjustment. That adjustment lowers a state's allocated share of the annual MSA payment if the OPMs lose market share to NPMs and if \"a nationally recognized firm of economic consultants\" determines that the MSA was \"a significant factor contributing to the Market Share Loss for the year in question.\" The NPM adjustment does not apply to any state that has enacted and has in \"full force and effect\" a \"qualifying\" or model escrow statute. All settling states have enacted qualifying statutes.\n\nThe escrow statute is premised on the legislative finding that, in light of the MSA settling the states' claims against the major cigarette manufacturers, [i]t would be contrary to the policy of the State if tobacco product manufacturers who determine not to enter into such a settlement could use a resulting cost advantage to derive large, short-term profits in the years before liability may arise without ensuring that the State will have an eventual source of recovery from them if they are proven to have acted culpably. It is thus in the interest of the State to require that such manufacturers establish a reserve fund to guarantee a source of compensation and to prevent such manufacturers from deriving large, short-term profits and then becoming judgment-proof before liability may arise.\n\nIn light of that, the model escrow statute requires an NPM selling cigarettes in [*1122] a given state to do one of two things: 1) join the MSA, agreeing to \"become a participating manufacturer (as that term is defined in section II(jj) of the [MSA]) and generally perform its financial obligations under the [MSA],\" or 2) make similar annual payments into a state \"liability reserve\" escrow account, the funds of which can only be used to pay a judgment or settlement on a claim against the NPM. (After 25 years, any amount remaining in the escrow account is returned to the NPM.) An NPM's annual escrow payments in a particular state are calculated by multiplying a per-cigarette amount, established by the state's legislature and set forth in the statute, by the number of cigarettes the NPM sold in that state in the year for which payment is being made. The parties agree that this per-cigarette amount is roughly equivalent to the per-cigarette amount the MSA requires from OPMs and SPMs for sales which are not exempt. To the extent it differs, the OPMs pay slightly more than the SPMs, which pay slightly more than the NPMs.\n\nThe escrow statute specifically requires that the NPM place into a qualified escrow fund by April 15 of the year following the year in question the following amounts (as such amounts are adjusted for inflation)—\n\nEach state receives a payment equal to its \"Allocable Share,\" a percentage of the funds held in escrow that has been agreed upon by the settling states and memorialized in the MSA. This \"Allocable Share\" (as measured by a percentage of the total funds in escrow) does not vary according to how many cigarettes are sold in a particular state in a given year.\n\nDuring the drafting of the MSA, the OPMs and the settling states contemplated that many of the smaller tobacco companies would choose not to join the MSA. This failure to join posed a potential problem for both the OPMs and the settling states. The OPMs worried that the NPMs, both because they would not be bound by the advertising and other restrictions in the MSA and because they would not be required to make payments to the settling states, would be able to charge lower prices for their cigarettes and thus increase their market share.\n\nAlthough the settling states' motivation was different from that of the OPMs, these states also were concerned about the effect of the tobacco companies that refused to join the MSA. The settling states worried that the NPMs would be able to regulate their sales so as to stay afloat financially while at the same time being effectively judgment-proof. As a result of these twin concerns, the OPMs and the settling states sought to have the MSA provide these other tobacco companies with incentives to join the agreement.\n\nOne such incentive, called the NPM Adjustment, provides that the payments by the PMs to the settling states may be adjusted according to the \"NPM Adjustment Percentage.\" According to this provision, if a nationally recognized firm of economic consultants determines that the PMs have lost market share as a result of compliance with the MSA, the PMs' required payments to the settling states will be reduced to account for the loss. The NPM Adjustment therefore gives the settling states an incentive to protect the market dominance of the PMs, because [*551] otherwise the settling states themselves will receive less funds. The MSA also provides a safe harbor from the NPM Adjustment if a settling state \"diligently enforces\" the provision of a Model Statute attached to the MSA and enacted by all of the settling states.\n\nMost of the settling states have also voluntarily adopted \"complementary\" legislation to provide additional enforcement tools to compel compliance with the Model Statute.\n\nThe original escrow statutes provided that NPM payments would remain in escrow for 25 years, but authorized an early release of any escrow amount which was greater than the allocable share which that state would have received if the NPM had been an SPM. The originally enacted escrow statutes permitted an NPM to obtain a refund of the amount the NPM paid into the escrow fund to the extent that a tobacco product manufacturer establishes that the amount it was required to place into escrow in a particular year was greater than the State's allocable share of the total payments that such manufacturer would have been required to make in that year under the [MSA] . . . had it been a participating manufacturer. This \"Allocable Share Release Provision\" was intended to create substantial equivalence between the escrow obligation of NPMs under the escrow statutes and the amounts the NPMs would have paid if they had they joined the MSA.\n\nThe settling states agreed to divide the annual MSA payment among themselves according to each state's preset allocable share, rather than according to the volume of sales made in a particular state in a given year. An NPM's payments into a state's escrow fund, on the other hand, were dependent on the number of cigarettes that the NPM sold in that state in a given year. Nevertheless, the originally enacted escrow statute based any refund of those escrowed funds payments on that state's allocable share of the national MSA payment. This refund provision, then, assumed an NPM would sell its cigarettes nationally.\n\nIf an NPM made the bulk of its sales in a few states, however, it could obtain a refund of those escrow payments in excess of what it would have paid each of those States had it been an SPM. For example, an NPM which made 50 per cent of its sales in Kansas (which has a relatively low allocable share) would obtain a release from its Kansas escrow fund of more than 49 per cent of its full escrow payment. In other words, the original allocable share release provision created an unintended loophole: it only operated as intended if the NPMs distributed their products nationally. In that circumstance, the NPMs' total escrow obligations to all states with similar tobacco statutes approximately totaled the payments those NPMs would have made under the MSA. If an NPM concentrated its sales in a few state with low allocable share percentages, however, the NPM could obtain a refund of much of its escrow payments. Because the Kansas percentage was so low—roughly 0.8 per cent—NPMs concentrated their sales within Kansas and a few other states to receive immediate escrow refunds from those states.\n\nRather than selling cigarettes nationally, several NPMs instead concentrated their sales in just a few states. Because the originally enacted escrow statute refunded escrow funds to the extent those funds exceeded each state's \"allocable share\" of the national MSA payment, NPMs were able to obtain refunds of most of the monies they had paid into a state's escrow fund. To illustrate, if an NPM only sold cigarettes in Kansas in 2006, the Kansas escrow statute would require that NPM to pay into the Kansas escrow fund $.0167539 for each cigarette the NPM sold in that state. Pursuant to the refund provision in the originally enacted Kansas escrow statute, however, the NPM could obtain a refund of all but .8336712% of those payments.\n\nOne commentator further explains that the calculations under the [originally enacted escrow] statutes were based on an assumption that a nonparticipating manufacturer sold cigarettes nationally. When this was the case, the statutes functioned as intended, permitting the NPM to obtain a refund of excess amounts placed in escrow in each state. However, when an NPM followed a regional sales strategy, as several did, the original escrow statutes allowed the NPM to obtain a refund that was much larger than intended.\n\nTo close this loophole, in late 2002, the National Association of Attorneys General (\"NAAG\") introduced the Allocable Share Release Repealer (\"ASR Repealer\"), a model statute which eliminated the ASR. In a memo dated September 12, 2003, Attorney General William H. Sorrell of Vermont, Chairman of the NAAG Tobacco Project, underscored the urgency of \"all States taking steps to deal with the proliferation of NPM sales, including enactment of complementary legislation and allocable share legislation and consideration of other measures designed to serve the interests of the States in avoiding reductions in tobacco settlement payments.\" He stressed that \"NPM sales anywhere in the country hurt all States,\" that NPM sales in any state reduce payments to every other State,\" and that \"[a]ll States have an interest in reducing NPM sales in every State.\"\n\nThe \"Allocable Share Release Repeal\" (\"ASR Repeal\") revised the originally enacted escrow statute's refund calculation to remove the reference to the enacting state's \"allocable share\" of the annual MSA payments. HN2The amended statute, therefore, now provides that an NPM will be entitled to a refund[t]o the extent that a tobacco product manufacturer establishes that the amount it was required to place into escrow, based on units sold in the state . . . in a particular year, was greater than the [MSA] payments, as determined pursuant to section IX(i) of that agreement including, after final determination of all adjustments, that such manufacturer would have been required to make based on such units sold had it been a participating manufacturer, the excess shall be released from escrow and revert to such tobacco product manufacturer.\n\nThus, an NPM still has to pay annually into a state's escrow fund an amount calculated by multiplying the number of cigarettes the NPM sells in that state during the year in question by the same per-cigarette amount for that year as set forth in the state's escrow statute. The NPM can obtain a refund to the extent those escrowed funds are greater than the amount that the NPM would have had to pay under the MSA for that same year, based upon that same number of cigarettes sold.\n\nBy the middle of 2000, domestic NPMs and importers began to obtain greater market share. The NAAG noted that reductions in settlement payments which result from an overall reduction in cigarette consumption benefit the states because health care costs imposed by each cigarette exceed the settlement payments. On the other hand, when reductions in settlement payments occur because NPM sales displace PM sales, the states receive no benefits if the NPMs do not make escrow payments. Therefore, in late 2000, the NAAG drafted a model Contraband Statute to ensure that NPMs made escrow payments on cigarettes. See PX 116. The model Contraband Statute provides that excise tax stamping agents may not stamp cigarettes for sale in the state unless the manufacturer becomes a PM under the MSA or is an NPM which makes all escrow payments required by the Escrow Statute. The model Contraband Statute imposes a criminal penalty on wholesalers who sell cigarettes made by NPMs who are not duly registered in the state and making full escrow payments. By the middle of 2002, only seven settling states had enacted Contraband Statutes. As of 2007, 44 of the 46 settling states (including Kansas) have enacted these statutes. See K.S.A. § 50-6a04. The Kansas Attorney General is charged with enforcing the Escrow and Contraband Statutes.\n\nSome anti-smoking advocates, such as William Godshall, have criticized the MSA as being too lenient on the major tobacco companies. In a speech at the National Tobacco Control Conference, Godshall stated that \"[w]ith unprecedented future legal protection granted by the state A.G.s in exchange for money, it appears that the tobacco industry has emerged from the state lawsuits even more powerful\".\n\nAn article in the Journal of the National Cancer Institute described the MSA as an \"opportunity lost to curb cigarette use\", citing public health researchers' views that not enough of the MSA money was being spent on anti-smoking measures. Dr. Stephen A. Schroeder wrote in the \"New England Journal of Medicine\" that \"Although U.S. smoking rates are slowly declining, progress toward that end [decreasing smoking] would be faster if federal policymaking matched both the rigor of the scientific evidence against tobacco use and the resolve of antitobacco advocates.\" Cigarette consumption in the United States fell to a 50-year low in 2004.\n\nAnother criticism is the alleged favoritism shown to the major tobacco companies over smaller independent tobacco growers and sellers. Proponents of this argument claim that certain restrictions on pricing make it more difficult for small growers to compete with \"Big Tobacco\". Twelve states have successfully fought against this argument in court during the last two years and the enforcement of the MSA continues throughout the United States in perpetuity.\n\nFellows within the Cato Institute, such as Robert Levy, assert that the lawsuit that brought on the tobacco settlement was instigated by a need to make beneficiary payments to Medicaid recipients. Following the passage of laws that eliminated the tobacco companies' ability to provide evidence in court for their defense, the tobacco companies were forced to settle. The big four tobacco companies agreed to pay the state governments several billion dollars but the government in turn was to protect the big four tobacco companies from competition. The Master Settlement Agreement, they argue, created an unconstitutional cartel arrangement that benefited both the government and big tobacco.\n\nRobert Levy states:For 40 years, tobacco companies had not been held liable for cigarette-related illnesses. Then, beginning in 1994, led by Florida, states across the country sued big tobacco to recover public outlays for medical expenses due to smoking. By changing the law to guarantee they would win in court, the states extorted a quarter-trillion-dollar settlement, which was passed along in higher cigarette prices. Basically, the tobacco companies had money; the states and their hired-gun attorneys wanted money; so the companies paid and the states collected. Then sick smokers got stuck with the bill.\n\nThe argument the Master Settlement Agreement created a cartel of the major U.S. cigarette makers, allowing them to charge \"supracompetitive\" prices for their product, was rejected by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit in 2007. The appellate court concluded that the Plaintiffs had not alleged sufficient facts to show that the MSA and two related state laws violated the federal Sherman Act.\n\nIn the ten years following the settlement, many state and local governments have opted to sell so-called tobacco bonds. They are a form of securitization. In many cases the bonds permit state and local governments to transfer the risk of declines in future master settlement agreement payments to bondholders. In some cases, however, the bonds are backed by secondary pledges of state or local revenues, which creates what some see as a perverse incentive to support the tobacco industry, on whom they are now dependent for future payments against this debt.\n\nTobacco revenue has fallen more quickly than projected when the securities were created, leading to technical defaults in some states. Some analysts predict that many of the bonds will default entirely. Many of the longer-term bonds have been downgraded to junk ratings. More recently, financial analysts began raising concerns that the rapid growth of the electronic cigarette market is accelerating the decline of $97 billion outstanding in tobacco bonds. States with large populations, such as New York and California, are affected to a greater degree than others. Lawmakers in several states proposed measures to tax e-cigarettes like traditional tobacco products to offset the decline in TMSA revenue. They anticipate that taxing or banning e-cigarettes would be beneficial to the sale of combustible cigarettes.\n\nThere is technically a distinct MSA signed separately with each state. While these MSAs are identical, the states have had to enact enabling legislation which differs from state to state. Furthermore, each state's court system is entitled to create its own jurisdictional interpretations of the MSA text. As a result, legal understanding of the MSA differ from state to state.\n\nDocuments relating to the initial lawsuits filed by each individual state are available at the UCSF website.\n\n\n"}

A person with triplegia can be referred to as triplegic. While there is no typical pattern of involvement, it is usually associated with paralysis of both legs and one arm — but can also involve both arms and one leg. Triplegia can sometimes be considered a combination of hemiplegia (paralysis of arm and leg of one side of the body) overlaying diplegia (paralysis of both legs), or as quadriplegia (paralysis of four limbs) with less involvement in one extremity.\n\nThe condition is commonly associated with cerebral palsy, although conditions such as stroke can also lead to it. Triplegia has also been found to be due to an increase in intracranial pressure associated with hydrocephalus resulting from traumatic brain injury.\n\nA similar condition is triparesis, in which the patient suffers from paresis in three limbs, meaning that the limbs are very weak, but not completely paralyzed.\n\nIn a case reported only due to its rarity, triplegia was reported following a tonsillectomy (surgical removal of the tonsils). An eight-year-old male patient was sent to Willard Parker Hospital on August 12, 1929 and had been diagnosed with poliomyelitis. After an unrelated, and routine, tonsillectomy there was complete flaccid paralysis and loss of feeling in both the legs, right arm, and muscles in the trunk.\n\n"}

It is part of five-hospital Baptist Health, also in Jacksonville, Florida.\n\nIn 2016, U.S. News & World Report named Wolfson Children’s Hospital among the nation’s top 50 hospitals for neurology and neurosurgery, and gastroenterology and GI surgery. Wolfson Children’s Hospital achieved Magnet status by the American Nurses Credentialing Center in 2007 and again in 2012 and 2017, an international recognition of excellence in patient care.\n\nA not-for-profit children’s hospital that serves 157,000+ patients from birth to 21 years of age annually, Wolfson Children’s Hospital offers 30+ pediatric medical and surgical specialities through its long-time partnerships with Nemours Children’s Specialty Care, Jacksonville, and the University of Florida College of Medicine -- Jacksonville and Mayo Clinic Hospital in Florida.\n\nIn 1946, Morris David Wolfson wrote a letter to his sons, Sam Wolfson, Louis Wolfson, Saul Wolfson, Cecil Wolfson, and Nathan Wolfson asking them to build a children’s facility in Jacksonville, Florida. A $500,000 donation from the Wolfson Family Foundation led to the establishment of Wolfson Children’s Memorial Hospital, a 50-bed pediatric wing at Baptist Memorial Hospital (now Baptist Medical Center Jacksonville) in 1955.\n\nThe hospital grew incrementally during its early years, particularly in 1971, when pediatricians with the Northeast Florida Pediatric Society signed an agreement stating that a consolidated center of excellence would be the best way to serve the region's children and families.\n\nIn 1987, Wolfson and Nemours Children’s Specialty Care, Jacksonville, began their affiliation to better serve the area's children. Wolfson also began an academic affiliation with the University of Florida College of Medicine – Jacksonville in the 1990s, training pediatric residents, fellows and other professionals in pediatric medicine.\n\nIn 1993, a new Wolfson Children’s Hospital opened, offering a range of inpatient and outpatient services, including a level III Neonatal Intensive Care Unit; Pediatric Intensive Care Unit; Children's Emergency Center; and specialized programs such as pediatric oncology, radiology, pathology and research.\n\nSince 2011, the hospital has also expanded regionally, opening Wolfson Children’s Specialty Centers in Lake City, Florida; Daytona Beach, Florida; Brunswick, Georgia (in partnership with Southeast Georgia Health System); at the Baptist Clay Medical Campus in Fleming Island, Florida; and in Tallahassee, Florida (in partnership with Tallahassee Memorial HealthCare).\n\nIn 2012, Wolfson Children’s Hospital expanded with the opening of the new J. Wayne and Delores Barr Weaver Tower on the Baptist Medical Center Jacksonville campus. The hospital continues to expand its number of specialized services, and to provide child health advocacy outside of hospital walls through THE PLAYERS Center for Child Health, which offers education, childhood injury prevention, and legislative efforts to improve health care access for children.\n\nIn 1985, the Baptist Health Foundation was created to assist in fundraising for Baptist Health. The Foundation coordinates gifts and fundraising for Wolfson Children's Hospital in addition to four adult Baptist Health hospitals.\n\nThe hospital’s major fundraising event is the Wolfson Children’s Challenge, an annual event that features a 55K Ultra Marathon, 55K Ultra Relay, 30K Individual Run, 1-Mile Fun Run, and family-friendly activities.\nAnother signature event is Christmas in July, always held on July 25 each year, to collect toys and donations to help the hospital’s Child Life Department normalize the hospital experience and provide distraction through toy and play.\n"}

This is the time frame set by the UN to assess progress towards the Millennium Development Goals. Through interviews, group work and case studies with the children, their parents, teachers, community representatives and others, the project is collecting information not only about their material and social circumstances, but also their perspectives on their lives and aspirations for the futures, set against the environmental and social realities of their communities.\n\nYoung Lives is following two groups of children in each country:\n\nThese groups provide insights into every phase of childhood. The younger children are being tracked from infancy to their mid-teens and the older children through into adulthood, when some will become parents themselves. When this is matched with information gathered about their parents, it is possible to reveal much about the inter generational transmission of poverty, how families on the margins move in and out of poverty, and the policies that can make a real difference to their lives.\n\nThe research concentrates on 4 countries: Ethiopia, India (Andhra Pradesh), Peru and Vietnam, chosen because they reflect a wide range of cultural, political, geographical and social contexts. They face some of the common issues experienced by developing countries, such as high debt burden, post-conflict reconstruction and adverse environmental conditions such as drought and flood. By covering these countries, Young Lives aims to reveal patterns, commonalities and differences in four very different contexts where childhood - especially childhood poverty - is changing.\n\nThe project is core-funded by the UK Department for International Development (DFID), with sub-studies funded by International Development Research Center (IDRC) (in Ethiopia), UNICEF (in India), Irish Aid (in Vietnam) and the Bernard van Leer Foundation (in India and Peru).\n\n\n\nThis article is related to the List of non-governmental organizations in Vietnam.\n"}
