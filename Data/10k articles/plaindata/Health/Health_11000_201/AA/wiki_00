It is a medical non-profit organization with headquarters in Buenos Aires.\n\nThe group was founded on September 5, 1891, as the \"Sociedad Mèdica Argentina\" by a conference of doctors in Buenos Aires led by Dr. Pedro F. Roberts, an ophthalmologist, and Doctors José Penna and Alfredo Lagarde. Though the society was preceded by the Buenos Aires National Academy of Medicine (founded in 1822), the former was founded with a focus on advocacy on behalf of the nation's medical professionals, and was a response to hardships imposed by the Panic of 1890. Although the founding conference debated the possibility of establishing the society as a guild or trade union, these options were discarded in favor of creating a professional association and learned society.\n\nThe society was initially composed of 106 members, and was housed within the Illuminated Block, a historic, Jesuit center of learning; among its founding members was Dr. Juan B. Justo, later a leader of the Socialist Party of Argentina. It relocated to offices of its own in 1892, and as it grew, it became legally necessary to have the society succeed to the Argentine Medical Association, a name adopted by an assembly held on August 13, 1913. The Buenos Aires city government granted it a valuable Santa Fe Avenue lot for the construction of new offices in 1917, and the following year, new headquarters were inaugurated.\n\nThe new facilities allowed the association to grow, and by 1923, over 1,000 physicians had become members. Six societies comprised the association in 1919: internal medicine, surgery, biology, microbiology, radiology, and ophthalmology. Societies of urology and otolaryngology were added in 1922, and later, toxicology (1926), and pharmacology (1928). Dr. Carlos Mainini's tenure (1936–42) was marked by a notable expansion of the group's academic activities, including the establishment of the societies of orthopedic surgery, endocrinology, nutrition science, and mental health, as well as the Argentine Society of Medical History. The Argentine Society of Plastic, Reconstructive and Aesthetic Surgery was inducted in 1952.\n\nThe institution grew to include 43 societies, 7 associations, and 25 committees; over 37,000 physicians (over a fourth of the nation's total) were members. The association issues accreditation to health facilities nationwide, and since 1950, operates the school of Continuing Medical Education, which offers 60 courses to over 2,000 students yearly (including around 300 from overseas). Its periodical, the \"Revista de la Sociedad Médica Argentina\" has been published since October 1891, and its library, opened in 1917, houses over 25,000 volumes.\n\nThis scientific society was created in 1891 to promote medical science and improve health.\n\nIt carried scientific sessions to disseminated information, advances and various aspects of medicine.\n\nIt is composed of sections and / or subsidiaries representing different medical specialties and subspecialties. Their number is increasing, in view of the complexity that medical science takes every day.\n\nIs a center for teaching in different medical specialties. Basically, it performs continuing medical education and postgraduate education.\n\nThe AMA members require being doctors and having a behavior, honesty and morality of the profession itself.\n\nThey stand out in AMA statute the following:\n\n1. Contribute to the progress of medicine and encourage scientific research.\n\n2. Celebrating scientific activities by facilitating the exchange among its members in medical specialties.\n\n3. Contribute to teaching medical in the country.\n\n4. Publish the works of scientific interest to disseminate knowledge and encourage medical research.\n\n5. To promote scientific relations with other similar foreign societies.\n\nIt consists of a general assembly, a steering committee and a board of AMA.\n\nThe administration of the AMA is in charge of a steering committee headed by a chairman. It is elected by the majority of the members present at the Ordinary General Assembly.\n\nThe council of the AMA is constituted by the committee and the chairmen of the sections and subsidiaries.\n\nThe current president of the AMA is Prof. Dr. Elias Hurtado Hoyo.\n\nTo organize scientific efforts in each specialty or discipline sections are created.\n\nThese sections are increasingly important and popular because of the unceasing progress and development of health sciences.\n\nIn them, they develop conferences, round tables and complex clinical cases also for discussed by the attendees and encouraging colleague’s diagnosis and medical treatment. They also developed seminars, courses and other educational activities.\n\nThe EGAMA began in 1977. Brings together and coordinates all formal educational activities carried out at AMA. Some of them are specialists in different disciplines. Its current Director is Prof. Dr. Armando Arata.\n\nIt is the official publication of AMA.

The project aims to promote the early and accurate detection of breast and cervical cancer, and to provide relatively low-cost primary health care services to women in Armenia.\n\nArmenia's transition to a democratic, market-based society began with its independence from the Soviet Union in September 1991. The collapse of the Soviet economy, combined with the impact of the severe 1988 earthquake, left post-Soviet Armenia in economic shambles. Preventative medicine had been non-existent in Soviet Armenia, and the already limited government-supported healthcare system was totally crippled by the collapse of the USSR. In 1996 Armenia's Minister of Health identified breast cancer as the nation’s leading cause of cancer deaths among women, but Armenia was incapable of addressing its breast cancer crisis.\n\nIn 1997, AACA decided to explore the issue and organized its first Medical Mission to Armenia. The team included medical professionals from the Washington Hospital Center in Washington, D.C., and Akron City Hospital in Akron, Ohio who selected and trained Armenian medical professionals and helped install mammography units and other equipment to establish the first breast cancer screening facility in the Caucasus Region.\n\nOn April 28, 1997, AACA opened the Armenian American Mammography University Center (later renamed the Armenian American Wellness Center) on the campus of Yerevan State Medical University in Yerevan, Armenia. This was made possible through the financial support of the Armenian Diaspora in America, equipment and supplies donated by US-based corporations, and political support from both the Embassy of the United States, Yerevan and the Government of Armenia. \n\nThe second leading cause of cancer deaths among women in Armenia is cervical cancer, according to the Ministry of Health. To address this need, AACA created a partnership between the Wellness Center and Dr. Emma Zargarian, an OB/GYN at the Greater Baltimore Medical Center (affiliated with Johns Hopkins University). Today, the Center provides basic gynecological services, including annual Pap tests, diagnosis and treatment of pre-cancerous lesions, detection of sexually transmitted infections (STIs), infertility treatment, as well as menopausal counseling and assistance.\n\nA pathology laboratory was also established in June 2001, to facilitate the work of the Breast Health and Gynecology Departments. This was accomplished through a partnership with Professor Julia Albright, an immunologist from the George Washington University Hospital, and International Relief & Development (IRD), a Washington, D.C.-based NGO which provided equipment and supplies. Under the guidance of Dr. Camilla Cobb and Katherine Berberian of the University of Southern California’s Department of Cytopathology, Cytopathology and Needle aspiration biopsy (NAB), also known as fine needle aspiration cytology (FNAC), procedures for breast biopsies were also introduced at the Wellness Center.\n\nIn addition to its main facility in Yerevan, the Wellness Center operates two smaller satellite clinics that provide health care services to Armenians for whom travel to downtown Yerevan can prove difficult or prohibitively expensive.\n\nThe smaller of the two clinics is located on the outskirts of Yerevan, while the larger of the two is a ten-room medical facility owned by the Wellness Center that opened in July 2003. It is located by Lake Sevan, sixty miles northeast of Yerevan. It was created for patients in the city of Gavar, which has the highest per-capita rate of breast abnormalities in Armenia. Originally an old village house, the Clinic’s building was renovated extensively. Family-centered Primary Care services are also provided to families, including men and children.\n\nTo provide screening services to rural Armenians, the Wellness Center began monthly Medical Outreach Missions in 1997. Using a van donated by the US State Department’s Humanitarian Assistance Program, the Center transports doctors and a portable ultrasound machine to remote villages, providing free screenings. Patients with abnormalities are referred to the Center in Yerevan for mammograms and further diagnosis. In 2005, the Wellness Center also began to provide basic gynecological and primary health care services during these Missions.\n\nAwareness campaigns stress healthy lifestyle choices and the importance of annual mammograms, monthly breast self-examinations, and annual Pap smears. Since 1997, the Wellness Center has observed October as Breast Cancer Awareness Month. Breast screening services are provided at fifty percent of the normal subsidized fee, or at no cost to the destitute. Cultural, scientific and social events are also held. These social and cultural activities culminate in a \"health walk\", which attracts over 3,000 participants each year.\n\nIn 2002, in recognition of the impact that the Wellness Center had already made on women’s health care in the country, a Soviet-era five-story building was donated by a Presidential decree from the Armenian Government to the Wellness Center.\n\n"}

It is a mixture of human biowaste and liquid disinfectant that freezes at high altitude. The name comes from the blue color of the disinfectant. Airlines are not allowed to dump their waste tanks in mid-flight, and pilots have no mechanism by which to do so; however, leaks sometimes do occur.\n\nThere were at least 27 documented incidents of blue ice impacts in the United States between 1979 and 2003. These incidents typically happen under airport landing paths as the mass warms sufficiently to detach from the plane during its descent. A rare incident of falling blue ice causing damage to the roof of a home was reported on October 20, 2006 in Chino, California. A similar incident was reported in Leicester, UK, in 2007.\n\nIn 1971, a chunk of ice from an aircraft tore a large hole in the roof of the Essex Street Chapel in Kensington, London, and was one trigger for the demolition of the building.\n\nIn November 2011 a chunk of ice, the size of an orange, broke through the roof of a private house in Ratingen-Hösel, Germany.\n\nIn February 2013 a \"football sized\" ball of blue ice smashed through a conservatory roof in Clanfield, Hampshire causing around £10,000 worth of damage.\n\nIn October 2016 a chunk of ice tore a hole in a private house in Amstelveen, The Netherlands.\n\nIn May 2018, there were two incidents where chunks of blue ice fell onto residents in Kelowna, British Columbia. \n\nIn November 2018, there was an incident where a chunk of ice fell from the sky and crashed through the roof of a home in Bristol, England. \n\nBlue ice can also be dangerous to the aircraft itself; the National Transportation Safety Board has recorded three very similar incidents where waste from lavatories caused damage to the leaking aircraft. All involved Boeing 727s, and in all cases waste from a leaking lavatory hit one of the engines, mounted at the rear of the aircraft, causing a power loss. The flights made safe emergency landings with the two remaining engines. Nobody was injured.\nOnly one report specifically mentions ice, while another mentions \"soft body FOD\" (foreign object damage), indicating that the damage was caused by a relative soft object like ice or a bird and not a metallic object or a stone.\n\nBlue ice became known to many people from the last 2003 episode of the HBO series \"Six Feet Under\", in which a foot-sized chunk drops on a bystander. A similar incident occurs in the 1996 television series \"Early Edition\" episode “Frostbite” when the main character saves a man from being crushed by a chunk of blue ice. It was also mentioned in \"The Big Bang Theory\". This also happened in an episode of \"\". The title of the 1992 film \"Blue Ice\" is a reference to the phenomenon. The 2001 film \"Joe Dirt\" finds the title character (played by David Spade) proudly displaying a large chunk of \"blue ice\" which he has mistaken for a meteorite, and the topic has also been covered on the TV show \"MANswers\". Blue ice was also featured in an episode of the television series \"MythBusters\". Blue ice is a cause of death in season 4 of \"1000 Ways to Die\".\n\n"}

According to the Russian \"Brockhaus and Efron Encyclopedic Dictionary\", about 140 thousand tons of hemp were produced annually in the European part of the Russian Empire at the end of the 19th century, which accounted for about 40% of the production of hemp in Europe.\n\nDuring dekulakization, large farms engaged in cannabis cultivation were fragmented into small (0.1-0.15 ha) plots, handled and capable of satisfying only domestic needs. By the beginning of the 1930s, the \"cannabis industry of agriculture in the Middle Volga region, as well as in other cannabis regions of the USSR, is in a state of decline\", which is expressed in \"shrinking of acreage, low yields, reduction in the commodity share of gross collections.\" \n\nThe Great Soviet Encyclopedia of 1937 reports that:\nThe socialist reconstruction of agriculture has dramatically changed the face of backward cannabis cultivation in the USSR. The unfolding Stakhanov movement in agriculture, in particular among the cannabis growers, provided higher yields of cannabis. 14.03. In 1936 a special meeting of the leaders of the party and government was held with the leaders in flax and hemp. A number of Stakhanovites-carpet-weavers were awarded orders of the Union. After 1934 the cannabis crops began to recover, and if in 1934 the cannabis sown area was 598,000 hectares, then its crops in 1936 occupied 680,000 hectares, amounting to 4/5 of the world's total area under cannabis. Decree of the Council of People 's Commissars of the USSR and the Central Committee of the CPSU (b.) (March 1934) granted special privileges and advantages for hemp crops on homesteads, backyards and floodplains. Preparation of hemp fiber from cannabis in the USSR in 1933-34. reached 39.4 thousand tons and in 1934-35. - 44,9 thousand tons; production of hemp oil (from seeds) in the USSR in 1933 amounted to 5.0 thousand tons, and in 1934 - 6.3 thousand tons.\n\nEntering the 20th century, use of cannabis (largely as hashish) was confined to Russia's colonial acquisitions in Central Asia. In 1909, I. S. Levitov produced a pamphlet based on his studies in that region, noting that locals had used cannabis for six centuries or more, and that Russian colonists and cossacks had acquired the habit from the locals.\n\nIn 1926 and 1928, the Soviet Union produced some of its earliest regulations to prevent \"narcomania\", focused on cocaine and morphine, but it was in 1934 that they banned the unauthorized cultivation of cannabis and of opium poppy. A direct ban on the illegal sowing or cultivation of Indian hemp was introduced by Article 225 of the RSFSR Criminal Code of 1960, while hemp continued to occupy a significant place in the total volume of agricultural production. While cannabis had been long used in Central Asia, it was not until the 1960s that the issue received much attention from the Soviet government due to increased press coverage of drug use.\n\nIn modern Russia, per the Ministry of Internal Affairs, 93% of the nation's marijuana comes from Kazakhstan.\n\nA 1914 USDA report noted:\nIn 2006, Russia reduced the limits for criminal possession of many drugs, with the criminal threshold for cannabis being reduced from 20 to 6 grams for cannabis, and 5 to 2 grams for hashish.\n"}

Edward Harkness possessed a \"passionate commitment to social reform\" and was \"determined to improve health and health services for Americans.\" Through additional gifts and bequests between 1918 and 1959, the Harkness family's total contribution to the fund's endowment amounted to more than $53 million. Today, the Commonwealth Fund’s endowment stands at almost $700 million.\n\nAccording to the Rockefeller Archive Center, the Commonwealth Fund’s “early grants supported a variety of programs while generally promoting welfare, especially child welfare.” Over the years, it has given support to medical schools and to the building of hospitals and clinics. In New York City, the Commonwealth Fund was a major contributor to the building of Columbia-Presbyterian Medical Center of the College of Physicians and Surgeons and Presbyterian Hospital at Columbia University in 1922. By the mid-1920s the chief interest of the foundation had become public health, including mental hygiene, community health, rural hospitals, medical research, and medical education. Other grant areas included war relief, educational and legal research, and international medical fellowships.\n\nIn 1925, the Commonwealth Fund launched its international program of fellowships called the Commonwealth Fund Fellowships (now the Harkness Fellowships). Until the 1990s, the fellowship was open to scholars of all academic disciplines, and included many who went on to excel in science, the arts and business.\n\nFrom the late 1920s through the 1940s, the Commonwealth Fund supported the construction of rural hospitals, paving the way for the Hill-Burton Act in 1946. Following World War II, the foundation supported the development of new medical schools in the United States in an effort to address doctor shortages and meet the needs of communities lacking health care services. Other achievements include the Rochester Regional Hospital Council and the development of the Nurse Practitioner and Physician Assistant professions.\n\nIn the 1940s, the fund supported research by Dr. Georgios Papanikolaou that pioneered the Pap test as the basic technique for detecting cervical cancer. Refinement of cardiac catheterization into routine treatment resulted in a 1956 Nobel Prize for the Fund-supported researchers.\n\nIn the 1960s and early 1970s, the organization focused on developing urban health care systems, and in the late 1970s, worked to improve medical school curricula. In the 1980s, the Commonwealth Fund played a prominent role in the development of the patient-centered care movement and helped draw attention to the needs of older Americans.\n\nWhile the Commonwealth Fund does not typically accept donations, several gifts to the foundation have increased the endowment and expanded the scope of the Commonwealth Fund’s projects and programs:\n\nToday, the Commonwealth Fund works in the following areas:\n\nThe goal of the Health Care Delivery System Reform program is to improve outcomes and lower costs for high-cost, complex and vulnerable patient populations. Work supported by the program is governed by five strategies:\n\n\nAs the Affordable Care Act's central coverage reforms go into effect, the Commonwealth Fund’s Health Care Coverage and Access program aims to furnish policymakers and key stakeholders with timely analysis to inform successful implementation. Activities include the following:\n\n\nThis works builds on a history of tracking insurance coverage in the United States. The program's Biennial Health Insurance Survey has enabled researchers to examine the effects of the recent severe economic recession on insurance coverage, and to assess changes in coverage, access to care, and medical bill problems over a decade. It also helped identify the problem of the underinsured, which are people with health insurance but high medical expenses relative to income. The survey found that between 2003 and 2010, the number of underinsured rose from 16 million to 29 million. The program also conducts surveys of young adults, which, prior to the Affordable Care Act, have found they delay care because of lack of coverage.\n\nThe Commonwealth Fund’s International Program in Health Policy and Innovation promotes cross-national learning. Its annual international health care policy symposium in Washington, D.C., organized in collaboration with the U.S. health policy journal, \"Health Affairs\", brings together health ministers and other policymakers from nations including Australia, Canada, France, Germany, New Zealand, the Netherlands, Norway, Sweden, Switzerland, the United Kingdom, and the United States. The international health policy survey, which is released annually in November, provides valuable cross-country information about health care access, costs, and quality. The program also sponsors the Harkness Fellowship, which recruits researchers and practitioners from Australia, Germany, the Netherlands, New Zealand, and the United Kingdom, among other countries, to conduct health policy research in the United States.\n\nThe new Breakthrough Health Care Opportunities program will explore emerging technologies, care delivery processes, organizational models, incentives, and policies that could have a game-changing effect on health system performance. By bringing together innovators, users, entrepreneurs, venture capitalists and regulators, the program will facilitate the translation of these innovative ideas into practice.\nIn its first year, the program will focus on three areas: Engaging consumers in their health care through information technology; next-generation provider incentives that are grounded in behavioral change theory; and \"frugal innovations\" from the developing world that may be transferable to the United States.\n\nThe Commonwealth Fund's president is David Blumenthal, M.D. Blumenthal used to be the Samuel O. Thier Professor of Medicine at Harvard Medical School and Chief Health Information and Innovation Officer at Partners Healthcare System in Boston. From 2009 to 2011, Blumenthal served as the U.S. National Coordinator for Health Information Technology, with the charge to build an interoperable, private, and secure nationwide health information system and to support the widespread, meaningful use of health IT. Previously, he was a practicing primary care physician, director of the Institute for Health Policy, and professor of medicine and health policy at Massachusetts General Hospital/Partners Healthcare System and Harvard Medical School. He is a member of the Institute of Medicine and a former board member and national correspondent for the \"New England Journal of Medicine\".\n\nKathleen Regan is the executive vice president and chief operating officer of the Commonwealth Fund. Ms. Regan reports to the president and serves as a member of the executive management team. She is responsible for advising the president on all major policy, management, financial, board, and regulatory issues. Ms. Regan also serves as the foundation’s chief operating officer, chief financial officer, and corporate treasurer and secretary, and have oversight responsibility for the fund’s investments. Ms. Regan has been advising and investing in health care companies for the past 25 years. She became a venture partner at Radius Ventures, a venture capital fund focused on the life sciences and health care industry in 2010. She served as a senior advisor to the U.S. Department of State Global Health Initiative, and led the development of a $200 million public‒private partnership, Saving Mothers, Giving Life, to address maternal mortality in Sub-Saharan Africa in 2012.\n\nThe Commonwealth Fund’s Board of Directors comprises 11 members which make up four committees: the Executive & Finance Committee, the Audit & Compliance Committee, the Investment Committee, and the Governance & Nominating Committee. The members’ backgrounds are diverse and include hospital administration, journalism, university administration, consulting, financial management, and teaching.\n\n\n\nEstablished in 2005, the commission was composed of distinguished experts and leaders representing every sector of health care, as well as the state and federal policy arenas, the business sector, and academia. After publishing a number of influential reports on health reform leading up to and following the passage of the Affordable Care Act, the commission concluded its activities in March 2013.\n\n"}
{"id": "958031", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=958031", "title": "Compartmental models in epidemiology", "text": "Compartmental models in epidemiology\n\nCompartmental models are a technique used to simplify the mathematical modelling of infectious disease. The population is divided into compartments, with the assumption that every individual in the same compartment has the same characteristics. Its origin is in the early 20th century, with an important early work being that of Kermack and McKendrick in 1927.\n\nThe models are usually investigated through ordinary differential equations (which are deterministic), but can also be viewed in a stochastic framework, which is more realistic but also more complicated to analyse.\n\nCompartmental models may be used to predict properties of how a disease spreads, for example the prevalence (total number of infected) or the duration of an epidemic. Also, the model allows for understanding how different situations may affect the outcome of the epidemic, e.g., what the most efficient technique is for issuing a limited number of vaccines in a given population.\n\nThe SIR model is one of the simplest compartmental models, and many models are derivations of this basic form. The model consists of three compartments– S for the number susceptible, I for the number of infectious, and R for the number recovered (or immune). This model is reasonably predictive for infectious diseases which are transmitted from human to human, and where recovery confers lasting resistance, such as measles, mumps and rubella.\nThese variables (S, I, and R) represent the number of people in each compartment at a particular time. To represent that the number of susceptible, infected and recovered individuals may vary over time (even if the total population size remains constant), we make the precise numbers a function of \"t\" (time): S(\"t\"), I(\"t\") and R(\"t\"). For a specific disease in a specific population, these functions may be worked out in order to predict possible outbreaks and bring them under control.\n\nAs implied by the variable function of \"t\", the model is dynamic in that the numbers in each compartment may fluctuate over time. The importance of this dynamic aspect is most obvious in an endemic disease with a short infectious period, such as measles in the UK prior to the introduction of a vaccine in 1968. Such diseases tend to occur in cycles of outbreaks due to the variation in number of susceptibles (S(\"t\")) over time. During an epidemic, the number of susceptible individuals falls rapidly as more of them are infected and thus enter the infectious and recovered compartments. The disease cannot break out again until the number of susceptibles has built back up as a result of offspring being born into the susceptible compartment.\n\nEach member of the population typically progresses from susceptible to infectious to recovered. This can be shown as a flow diagram in which the boxes represent the different compartments and the arrows the transition between compartments, i.e.\n\nFor the full specification of the model, the arrows should be labeled with the transition rates between compartments. Between S and I, the transition rate is βI, where β is the contact rate, which takes into account the probability of getting the disease in a contact between a susceptible and an infectious subject.\n\nBetween I and R, the transition rate is γ (simply the rate of recovery or death). If the duration of the infection is denoted \"D\", then γ = 1/\"D\", since an individual experiences one recovery in \"D\" units of time.\n\nIt's assumed that the permanence of each single subject in the epidemic states is a random variable with exponential distribution. More complex and realistic distributions (such as Erlang distribution) can be equally used with few modifications.\n\nThe dynamics of an epidemic, for example the flu, are often much faster than the dynamics of birth and death, therefore, birth and death are often omitted in simple compartmental models. The SIR system without so-called vital dynamics (birth and death, sometimes called demography) described above can be expressed by the following set of ordinary differential equations:\n\nThis model was for the first time proposed by O. Kermack and Anderson Gray McKendrick as a special case of what we now call Kermack-McKendrick theory, and followed work McKendrick had done with Ronald Ross.\n\nThis system is non-linear, and does not admit a generic analytic solution. Nevertheless, significant results can be derived analytically, and with Monte Carlo methods, such as the Gillespie algorithm.\n\nFirstly note that from:\n\nit follows that:\n\nexpressing in mathematical terms the constancy of population formula_6. Note that the above relationship implies that one need only study the equation for two of the three variables.\n\nSecondly, we note that the dynamics of the infectious class depends on the following ratio:\nthe so-called basic reproduction number (also called basic reproduction ratio). This ratio is derived as the expected number of new infections (these new infections are sometimes called secondary infections) from a single infection in a population where all subjects are susceptible. This idea can probably be more readily seen if we say that the typical time between contacts is formula_8, and the typical time until recovery is formula_9. From here it follows that, on average, the number of contacts by an infected individual with others \"before\" the infected has recovered is: formula_10\n\nBy dividing the first differential equation by the third, separating the variables and integrating we get\n(where formula_12 and formula_13 are the initial numbers of, respectively, susceptible and removed subjects). Thus, in the limit formula_14, the proportion of recovered individuals obeys the following transcendental equation\nThis equation shows that at the end of an epidemic, unless formula_16, not all individuals of the population have recovered, so some must remain susceptible. This means that the end of an epidemic is caused by the decline in the number of infected individuals rather than an absolute lack of susceptible subjects.\nThe role of the basic reproduction number is extremely important. In fact, upon rewriting the equation for infectious individuals as follows:\nit yields that if:\nthen:\ni.e., there will be a proper epidemic outbreak with an increase of the number of the infectious (which can reach a considerable fraction of the population). On the contrary, if\nthen\ni.e., independently from the initial size of the susceptible population the disease can never cause a proper epidemic outbreak. As a consequence, it is clear that the basic reproduction number is extremely important.\n\nNote that in the above model the function:\n\nmodels the transition rate from the compartment of susceptible individuals to the compartment of infectious individuals, so that it is called the force of infection. However, for large classes of communicable diseases it is more realistic to consider a force of infection that does not depend on the absolute number of infectious subjects, but on their fraction (with respect to the total constant population formula_23):\n\nCapasso and, afterwards, other authors have proposed nonlinear forces of infection to model more realistically the contagion process.\n\nIn 2014, Harko T. et al. derived an exact analytical solution to the SIR model. In the without vital dynamics setup, for formula_25, etc., it corresponds to the following time parametrization\n\nfor formula_29, formula_30, with initial conditions formula_31 formula_32 satisfies formula_33. By the transcendental equation for formula_34 above, it follows that formula_35, if formula_36 and formula_37.\n\nAn equivalent analytical solution was found by Miller yields\n\nHere formula_42 can be interpreted as the expected number of transmissions an individual has received by time formula_43. The two solutions are related by formula_44.\n\nEffectively the same result can be found in the original work by Kermack and McKendrick .\nConsidering a population characterized by a death rate formula_45 and birth rate formula_46, and where a communicable disease is spreading. The model with mass-action transmission is:\n\nfor which the disease-free equilibrium (DFE) is:\n\nIn this case, we can derive a basic reproduction number :\nwhich has threshold properties. In fact, independently from biologically meaningful initial values, one can show that:\n\nThe point EE is called the Endemic Equilibrium. With heuristic arguments, one may show that formula_54 may be read as the average number of infections caused by a single infectious subject in a wholly susceptible population, the above relationship biologically means that if this number is less or equal than one the disease goes extinct, whereas if this number is greater than one the disease will remain permanently endemic in the population.\n\nSome infections, for example those from the common cold and influenza, do not confer any long lasting immunity. Such infections do not give immunization upon recovery from infection, and individuals become susceptible again.\n\nWe have the model:\n\nNote that denoting with N the total population it holds that:\nformula_57\nit follows that:\ni.e. the dynamics of infectious is ruled by a logistic equation, so that formula_59:\n\nFortunately, it is possible to find an analytical solution to this model (by making a transformation of variables: formula_62 and substituting this into the mean-field equations), such that the basic reproduction rate is greater than unity. The solution is given as\nwhere formula_64 is the endemic infected population, formula_65, and formula_66. As the system is assumed to be closed, the susceptible population is then formula_67.\n\nFor many infections, including measles, babies are not born into the susceptible compartment but are immune to the disease for the first few months of life due to protection from maternal antibodies (passed across the placenta and additionally through colostrum). This is called passive immunity. This added detail can be shown by including an M class (for maternally derived immunity) at the beginning of the model\n\nTo indicate this mathematically, an additional compartment is added, M(t), which results in the following differential equations:\n\nSome people who have had an infectious disease such as tuberculosis never completely recover and continue to carry the infection, whilst not suffering the disease themselves. They may then move back into the infectious compartment and suffer symptoms (as in tuberculosis) or they may continue to infect others in their carrier state, while not suffering symptoms. The most famous example of this is probably Mary Mallon, who infected 22 people with typhoid fever. The carrier compartment is labelled C.\n\nFor many important infections there is a significant incubation period during which the individual has been infected but is not yet infectious themselves. During this period the individual is in compartment E (for exposed).\n\nAssuming that the incubation period is a random variable with exponential distribution with\nparameter a (i.e. the average incubation period is formula_72), and also assuming the presence of vital dynamics with birth rate equal to death rate, we have the model:\n\nWe have formula_77, but this is only constant because of the (degenerate) assumption that birth and death rates are equal; in general formula_23 is a variable.\n\nFor this model, the basic reproduction number is:\n\nformula_79\n\nSimilarly to the SIR model, also in this case we have a Disease-Free-Equilibrium (N,0,0,0) and an Endemic Equilibrium EE, and one can show that, independently form biologically meaningful initial conditions\n\nit holds that:\n\nIn case of periodically varying contact rate formula_83 the condition for the global attractiveness of DFE is that the following linear system with periodic coefficients:\n\nis stable (i.e. it has its Floquet's eigenvalues inside the unit circle in the complex plane).\n\nThe SEIS model takes into consideration the exposed or latent period of the disease, giving an additional compartment, E(t).\nIn this model an infection does not leave any immunity thus individuals that have recovered return to being susceptible again, moving back into the \"S\"(\"t\") compartment. The following differential equations describe this model:\n\nFor the case of a disease, with the factors of passive immunity, and a latency period there is the MSEIR model.\n\nAn MSEIRS model is similar to the MSEIR, but the immunity in the R class would be temporary, so that individuals would regain their susceptibility when the temporary immunity ended.\n\nIt is well known that the probability of getting a disease is not constant in the time. Some diseases are seasonal, such as the common cold viruses, which are more prevalent during winter. With childhood diseases, such as measles, mumps, and rubella, there is a strong correlation with the school calendar, so that during the school holidays the probability of getting such a disease dramatically decreases.\n\nAs a consequence, for many classes of diseases one should consider a force of infection with periodically ('seasonal') varying contact rate\nwith period T equal to one year.\n\nThus, our model becomes\n\n(the dynamics of recovered easily follows from formula_100), i.e. a nonlinear set of differential equations with periodically varying parameters. It is well known that this class of dynamical systems may undergo very interesting and complex phenomena of nonlinear parametric resonance. It is easy to see that if:\n\nwhereas if the integral is greater than one the disease will not die out and there may be such resonances. For example, considering the periodically varying contact rate as the 'input' of the system one has that the output is a periodic function whose period is a multiple of the period of the input.\nThis allowed to give a contribution to explain the poly-annual (typically biennial) epidemic outbreaks of some infectious diseases as interplay between the period of the contact rate oscillations and the pseudo-period of the damped oscillations near the endemic equilibrium.\nRemarkably, in some cases the behavior may also be quasi-periodic or even chaotic.\n\nThe SIR model can be modified to model vaccination. Typically these introduce an additional compartment to the SIR model, formula_102, for vaccinated individuals. Below are some examples.\n\nIn presence of a communicable diseases, one of main tasks is that of eradicating it via prevention measures and, if possible, via the establishment of a mass vaccination program. Let us consider a disease for which the newborn are vaccinated (with a vaccine giving lifelong immunity) at a rate formula_103:\n\nwhere formula_102 is the class of vaccinated subjects. It is immediate to show that:\n\nthus we shall deal with the long term behavior of formula_109 and formula_110, for which it holds that:\n\nIn other words, if\nthe vaccination program is not successful in eradicating the disease, on the contrary it will remain endemic, although at lower levels than the case of absence of vaccinations. This means that the mathematical model suggests that for a disease whose basic reproduction number may be as high as 18 one should have to vaccinate 94.4% of newborns in order to eradicate the disease.\n\nModern societies are facing the challenge of \"rational\" exemption, i.e. the family's decision to not vaccinate children as a consequence of a \"rational\" comparison between the perceived risk from infection and that from getting damages from the vaccine. In order to assess whether this behavior is really rational, i.e. if it can equally lead to the eradication of the disease, one may simply assume that the vaccination rate is an increasing function of the number of infectious subjects:\nIn such a case the eradication condition becomes:\ni.e. the baseline vaccination rate should be greater than the \"mandatory vaccination\" threshold, which, in case of exemption, cannot hold. Thus, \"rational\" exemption might be myopic since it is based only on the current low incidence due to high vaccine coverage, instead taking into account future resurgence of infection due to coverage decline.\n\nIn case there also are vaccinations of non newborn at a rate ρ the equation for the susceptible and vaccinated subject has to be modified as follows:\n\nleading to the following eradication condition:\n\nThis strategy repeatedly vaccinates a defined age-cohort (such as young children or the elderly) in a susceptible population over time. Using this strategy, the block of susceptible individuals is then immediately removed, making it possible to eliminate an infectious disease, (such as measles), from the entire population. Every T time units a constant fraction p of susceptible subjects is vaccinated in a relatively short (with respect to the dynamics of the disease) time. This leads to the following impulsive differential equations for the susceptible and vaccinated subjects:\n\nIt is easy to see that by setting one obtains that the dynamics of the susceptible subjects is given by:\n\nand that the eradication condition is:\n\nAge has a deep influence on the disease spread rate in a population, especially the contact rate. This rate summarizes the effectiveness of contacts between susceptible and infectious subjects. Taking into account the ages of the epidemic classes formula_123 (to limit ourselves to the susceptible-infectious-removed scheme) such that:\n\n(where formula_127 is the maximum admissible age)and their dynamics is not described, as one might think, by \"simple\" partial differential equations, but by integro-differential equations:\n\nwhere:\n\nis the force of infection, which, of course, will depend, though the contact kernel formula_132 on the interactions between the ages.\n\nComplexity is added by the initial conditions for newborns (i.e. for a=0), that are straightforward for infectious and removed:\n\nbut that are nonlocal for the density of susceptible newborns:\n\nwhere formula_135 are the fertilities of the adults.\n\nMoreover, defining now the density of the total population formula_136 one obtains:\n\nIn the simplest case of equal fertilities in the three epidemic classes, we have that in oder to have demographic equilibrium the following necessary and sufficient condition linking the fertility formula_138 with the mortality formula_139 must hold:\n\nand the demographic equilibrium is\n\nautomatically ensuring the existence of the disease-free solution:\n\nA basic reproduction number can be calculated as the spectral radius of an appropriate functional operator.\n\nIn the case of some diseases such as AIDS and Hepatitis B, it is possible for the offspring of infected parents to be born infected. This transmission of the disease down from the mother is called Vertical Transmission. The influx of additional members into the infected category can be considered within the model by including a fraction of the newborn members in the infected compartment.\n\nDiseases transmitted from human to human indirectly, i.e. malaria spread by way of mosquitoes, are transmitted through a vector. In these cases, the infection transfers from human to insect and an epidemic model must include both species, generally requiring many more compartments than a model for direct transmission. For more information on this type of model see the reference \"Population Dynamics of Infectious Diseases: Theory and Applications\", by R. M. Anderson.\n\nOther occurrences which may need to be considered when modeling an epidemic include things such as the following:\n\nIt is important to stress that the deterministic models presented here are valid only in case of sufficiently large populations, and as such should be used cautiously.\n\nTo be more precise, these models are only valid in the thermodynamic limit, where the population is effectively infinite. In stochastic models, the long-time endemic equilibrium derived above, does not hold, as there is a finite probability that the number of infected individuals drops below one in a system. In a true system then, the pathogen may not propagate, as no host will be infected. But, in deterministic mean-field models, the number of infecteds can take on real, namely, non-integer values of infected hosts, and the pathogen may still persist in the system with a finite number of infected hosts, less than one but greater than zero.\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "4639751", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=4639751", "title": "Dental impression", "text": "Dental impression\n\nA dental impression is a negative imprint of hard (teeth) and soft tissues in the mouth from which a positive reproduction (cast or model) can be formed. It is made by placing an appropriate material in a stock or custom dental impression tray which is designed to roughly fit over the dental arches. Impression material is of liquid or semi-solid nature when first mixed and placed in the mouth. It then sets to become an elastic solid (usually takes a few minutes depending upon the material), leaving an imprint of person's dentition and surrounding structures of oral cavity.\n\nImpressions, and the study models, are used in several areas of dentistry including:\nThe required type of material for taking an impression and the area that it covers will depend on the clinical indication. Common materials used for dental impressions are:\n\nImpressions can also be described as mucostatic or mucocompressive, being defined both by the impression material used and the type of impression tray used (i.e. spaced or closely adapted). \"Mucostatic\" means that the impression is taken with the mucosa in its normal resting position. These impressions will generally lead to a denture which has a good fit during rest, but during chewing, the denture will tend to pivot around incompressible areas (e.g. torus palatinus) and dig into compressible areas. \"Mucocompressive\" means that the impression is taken when the mucosa is subject to compression. These impressions will generally lead to a denture that is most stable during function but not at rest. Dentures are at rest most of the time, so it could be argued that mucostatic impressions make better dentures, however in reality it is likely that tissue adaption to the presence of either a denture made with a mucostatic or a mucocompressive technique make little difference between the two in the long term.\nAnother type of impression technique is selective pressure technique in which stress bearing areas are compressed and stress relief areas are relieved such that both the advantages of muco static and muco compressive techniques are achieved.\n\n\nWhen taking impression for provision of crown and bridge work, the preparation border needs to be accurately captured by the light bodied impression material. For this reason, the gingival tissues need to be pushed away from the preparation margin in order to make it accessible to the impression material. One way to retract gingival tissues away from the tooth is by insertion of a retraction cord into the gingival crevice.\n\nImpression materials can be considered as follows:\n\nPlaster of Paris is traditionally used as a casting material once the impression has been taken, however its use as an impression material is occasionally useful in edentate patients. The tissues are not displaced during impression taking, hence the material is termed \"mucostatic.\" Mainly composed of β-calcium sulphate hemihydrate, impression plaster has a similar composition and setting reaction to the casting material with an increase in certain components to control the initial expansion that is observed with Plaster of Paris. Additionally, more water is added to the powder than with the casting material to aid in good flow during impression taking. As the impression material is very similar to the casting material to be used, it requires the incorporation of a separating medium (e.g. sodium alginate) to aid in separating the cast from the impression. If a special tray is to be used, impression plaster requires 1–1.5mm spacing for adequate thickness.\n\nAdvantages:\nDisadvantages:\n\nImpression compound has been used for many years as an impression material for removable prostheses. Although its use has recently declined with the advent of better materials. Due to its poor flow characteristics, it is unable to reproduce fine detail and so its use is somewhat limited to the following scenarios:\nImpression compound is a thermoplastic material; it is presented as a sheet of material, which is warmed in hot water (> 55–60 °C) for one minute, and loaded on a tray prior to impression taking. Once in the mouth, the material will harden and record the detail of the soft tissues. The impression can further be hardened by placing it in cold water after use. Impressions with compound should be poured within an hour as the material exhibits poor dimensional stability. There are two main presentations of impression compound: red compound and greenstick. The latter is mainly used for border moulding and recording the post-dam area.\n\nImpression paste is traditionally used to take the working (secondary) impressions for a complete denture. When used with a special tray it requires 1 mm of spacing to allow for enough thickness of the material; this is also termed a \"close fitting\" special tray. It is available as a two-paste system:\nThe two pastes should be used in equal amounts and blended together with a stainless steel spatula (Clarident spatula) on a paper pad. Zinc-oxide Eugenol plaster will produce a mucostatic impression.\n\nAdvantages:\nDisadvantages:\n\nAgar is a material which provides high accuracy. Therefore, it is used in fixed prosthodontics (crowns, bridges) or when a dental model has to be duplicated by a dental technician. Agar is a true hydrophilic material, hence the teeth do not need to be dried before placing it into the mouth. It is a reversible hydrocolloid which means that its physical state can be changed by altering its temperature which allows to reuse the material multiple times. The material comes in form of tubes or cartridges. A special hardware is required in the process of taking agar impressions, namely a water bath and rim lock trays with coiled edges allowing passage of cold water for cooling the material to set while in the mouth. The bath consists of three containers filled with water at different temperatures: the first is set at 100 °C to liquefy the agar, the second is used to lower down the temperature of the material for safe intra-oral use (usually set at 43–46 °C) and the third one is used for storage and is set at 63–66 °C. The storage container can maintain agar tubes and cartridges at temperature 63–66 °C for several days for convenient immediate use. The tray is connected to a hose, material is loaded onto the tray and placed in the mouth over the preparation – an adequate thickness of the material is required, otherwise distortion may occur upon removal from the mouth. The other end of the hose is connected to a cold water source. The hydrocolloid is then cooled down through the tray wall which results in setting of the material. The models should be poured as soon as possible to avoid changes in dimensional stability.\n\nModern dentistry offers other materials (e.g. elastomerics) which provide high accuracy impressions and are easier to use hence agar is used less frequently.\n\nAdvantages:\nDisadvantages:\n\nAlginate, on the other hand, is an irreversible hydrocolloid. It exists in two phases: either as a viscous liquid, or a solid gel, the transition generated by a chemical reaction.\nThe impression material is created through adding water to the powdered alginate which contains a mixture of sodium and potassium salts of alginic acid. The overall setting double composition reaction is as follows:\n\n\"Potassium (sodium) alginate + calcium sulphate dihydrate + water → calcium alginate + potassium (sodium) sulphate\"\n\nSodium phosphate is added as a retarder which preferentially reacts with calcium ions to delay the set of the material.\n\nAlginate has a mixing time of 45–60 secs, a working time of 45 secs (fast set) and 75 secs (regular set). The setting time can be between 1 – 4.5 mins which can be varied by the temperature of water used: the cooler the water, the slower the set and vice versa. You want to ensure that the material is fully set before removal from the mouth.\n\nThe water content that the completed impression is exposed to must be controlled. Improper storage can either result in syneresis (the material contracts upon standing and exudes liquid) or imbibition (water uptake which is uncontrolled in extent and direction). Therefore, the impression must be stored correctly, which involves wrapping the set material in a damp tissue and storing it in a sealed polythene bag until the impression can be cast. Alginate is used in dental circumstances when less accuracy is required. For example, this includes the creation of study casts to plan dental cases and design prosthesis, and also to create the primary and working impressions for denture construction.\n\nSeveral faults can be encountered when using an alginate impression material, but these can generally be avoided through adequate mixing, correct spatulation, correct storage of the set material, and timely pouring of the impression.\n\nDue to the increased accuracy of elastomers, they are recommended for taking secondary impressions over alginate. Patients both preferred the overall experience of having an impression taken with an elastomer than with alginate, and also favoured the resultant dentures produced.\n\nAdvantages:\n\nDisdavantages:\n\nAs stated above, there are times clinically where the accuracy of an alginate impression is not acceptable, particularly for the construction of fixed prosthodontics. Agar may be used but as discussed has a number of technical difficulties in its use. As such elastomers were developed to capture the fine detail and accuracy required.\n\nPolysulphides have become increasingly unpopular due to their unpleasant taste/smell. The material is presented as a paste to paste system mixed by a dental nurse prior to use. The material sets by a condensation polymerisation reaction. Initially the polymer chains increase in length causing a slight increase in temperature, of 3–4 °C. This is then followed by cross linking of the polymer chains and finally the release of water as a by product. This later reaction slightly contracts the material making it stiffer and more resistant to permanent deformation. When poured and cast this slight contraction means the resulting model is slightly larger and as such creates space for the luting cement.\n\nAdvantages:\nDisadvantages:\n\nPolyethers are the most hydrophilic impression material of the hydrophobic elastomers. This property makes it a commonly used material in general practice as it more likely to capture preparation margins when moisture control is not perfect.\n\nPresented as a paste to paste system the material is often used with a monophase impression technique, meaning both the material syringed round the preparation and the bulk within the tray are the same material. Note when mixing polyether the base to accelerator ratio is not 1:1 with most elastomers but 1:4.\n\nAdvantages:\nDisadvantages:\nIndications:\n\nThere are two types of silicone impression material, addition and condensation (reflecting each of their setting reactions). Silicones are inherently hydrophobic and as such require excellent moisture control for optimal use.\n\nAddition silicones have become the most used impression material in advanced restorative dentistry. There are many forms available, based on their differing amounts of filler content. This dictates the flow properties of each type with more filler resulting in a thicker, less flowable material. The most common forms are: extra light-bodied (low filler content), light-bodied, universal or medium-bodied, heavy-bodied and putty (high filler content). However each type follows the same addition polymerisation reaction and is presented as a paste to paste system. The reaction does not produce any by-product making it dimensionally stable and very accurate.\n\nAdvantages:\nDisadvantages:\nIndications:\nContraindications\n\nCondensation silicones are commonly used as a putty, paste or light bodied material. The systems are usually presented as a paste or putty and a liquid/paste catalyst; meaning accurate proportioning is difficult to achieve resulting in varied outcomes. For example, the setting reaction of putty is started by kneading a low viscosity paste accelerator into a bulk of silicone with high filler content.\n\nAs stated the material sets by a condensation reaction forming a three-dimensional silicone matrix whilst releasing ethyl alcohol as a by-product. This in turn results in a minimally exothermic set with marked shrinkage on setting (shrinkage being relative to filler content, where high filler content has reduced shrinkage).\n\nAdvantages:\nDisadvantages:\nIndications:\n\nAn impression tray is a container which holds the impression material as it sets, and supports the set impression until after casting. Impression trays can be separated into two main categories- stock trays and special trays.\n\nStock trays are used to take primary impressions and come in a range of sizes and shapes, and can be plastic or metal. Stock trays can be rounded (designed to fit the mouths of people with no remaining teeth) or squared (designed to fit people with some remaining teeth). They can be full arch, covering all the teeth in either the upper or lower jaw in one impression, or a partial coverage tray, designed to fit over about three teeth (used when making crowns). The stock tray with the closest size and shape to the patient's own arch dimensions is selected for impressions.\n\nStock trays must meet various requirements in order to obtain a satisfactory impression. A good stock tray will:\n\nStock trays can be dentate or edentulous, and perforated (used with alginate) or non-perforated (allows the impression material to run through the holes and increase the bond of the impression material to the tray when set).\n\nPlastic stock trays are generally injection moulded from a high-impact styrene such as polystyrene. The Triple Tray is a type of plastic tray used for taking impressions for a crown using the double arch or dual bite impression technique. It is used for taking impressions of the tooth preparation and the opposing teeth, by the use of a special impression material, usually elastomer. The accuracy of the results is however subject to the ability of the patient to close their teeth when the tray is present in the mouth. It cannot produce results of the complete arch, therefore its usefulness is limited.\n\nMetal stock trays are often preferred over plastic stock trays, due to the lack of rigidity in plastic stock trays. Although expensive to purchase, they have the benefit of being reusable, so can be more cost-efficient in the long-term.\n\nA special tray is an impression tray custom made for an individual patient by a denturist (dental technician), usually made from acrylic, such as polymethyl methacrylate, or shellac. A stock tray is used to make a preliminary impression, from which a model can be cast. This is then used for wax to make the tray to be laid down. The thickness corresponds to specific spacing, and can be classed as spaced, where about 3mm of space is left between the tray and the mucosa for the impression material to occupy, or closely adapted, where less space is left for the impression material. This is determined by the impression material to be used.\n\nSpecific features can be given to the special tray to improve the accuracy of the impression such as a window which can help to record displaceable tissues such as flabby ridges when used with a less viscous impression material. Special trays can be given perforations if required by drilling holes in tray.\n\nCustomised trays have been less frequently used since the advent of putties. This is due to the putty providing good support for light bodied material, and showing very little dimensional change which provides a fine detailed dental impression. There is now a large increase in the variety of stock trays available.\n\nTray adhesives are used to ensure the retention of the impression material in the impression tray, with or without the presence of perforations, and are based on contact adhesive technology. Maximum retention can be achieved with the presence of both a tray adhesive and perforations in the impression tray. The adhesive is applied to the internal surface of the tray, as well as over the margins to ensure the binding of the outer edge of the impression material to the tray. A suitable amount of adhesive (usually two thin coats) should be applied to the tray to prevent pooling of the adhesive which can weaken the bond between the tray and impression material. The adhesive should be completely dried prior to impression-taking. \nTray adhesives usually come in a screw-top bottle with a brush attached to the lid that can be used for applying the adhesive. Overtime, the adhesive can accumulate around the cap, causing the evaporation of the solvent, and consequently the thickening of the adhesive. This can reduce the efficacy of the adhesive to bind to the tray.\n\nVarious tray adhesives are available, corresponding to the impression material used. \n"}

Adkins is best known for her work in psychometrics and education testing, particularly in achievement testing. She was the first female president of the Psychometric Society and served in several roles in the American Psychological Association. \n\nAdkins was born on April 6, 1912 in Atlanta, a town in Pickaway County, Ohio. Adkins father, George Hoadley Adkins, worked as a businessman as well as a farmer and her mother, Peal F. James-Adkins worked as a teacher at a local school. Dorothy was the couple’s third child. She attended public school in Atlanta, until graduation in 1927. Growing up in Atlanta, Ohio, Adkins developed a love of music, which lead her to later study violin at the Cincinnati Conservatory of Music. After only one year at the Conservatory, she quit to pursue a degree in mathematics from Ohio State University. Her interest in mathematics quickly drew her to statistics and psychometrics, and she took up psychology. \nAdkins attended public schools until her graduation in 1927. Adkins attended Ohio State University for both her Bachelors of Science degree (1931) and PhD (1937) in mathematics and psychology. Her PhD was completed under the advisement of Herbert Toops. Toops was a student of Edward Lee Thorndike for psychology and Truman Kelly for statistics. Adkins competed her PhD in 1937 under the title “A Comparative Study of Methods of Selecting Test Items”. \nWhile completing her PhD Adkins began working as a psychometrics assistant examiner under Louis Leon Thurstone at the University of Chicago. Upon completion of her PhD she was eventually promoted to research associate in 1938. During her time at the University of Chicago she was exposed to test development. \n\nAdkins time as a psychometrics assistant examiner at the University of Chicago and research experience made her a desirable job candidate upon her graduation. In 1940 she was offered a position with the United States government, working as an assistant chief of Research and Test Development for the United States Social Security Board in Washington, D.C. She would later be promoted to the chief of this department. Adkins also worked as Chief of Social Sciences and Administrative Testing and the Chief of Test Development for the U.S. Civil Service Commission while in D.C. from 1940 to 1948. During this time, she received special assignments from the government to the Virgin Islands, Puerto Rico, Georgia, and Thailand. It would be almost a decade before Adkins returned to academia. \n\nIn 1948 Adkins accepted a faculty position at the University of North Carolina Chapel Hill. After only two years at the university, she was promoted to chairman of the department of psychology. Adkins held this position until 1961, and for 11 of those years she was the only female department chair at the university. During this time at the University of North Carolina Adkins served as the Merit System Supervisor for the North Carolina Merit System and was a consultant to the NCMS and the North Carolina State Personnel Board from 1956 to 1959. It was also during this time that she wrote one of her most well known books: Test Construction: Development and Interpretation of Achievement Tests (1960). \n\nAdkins was the first female president of the Psychometric Society, serving from 1949-1950. The first president of the Psychometric Society was Adkins research advisor at the University of Chicago, L.L. Thurstone, who served from 1935-1936. Since the Society’s founding in 1935, there have only been five female presidents. Following Adkins, there was a 46-year gap before another woman would be appointed that role (Fumiko Samejima 1996). Adkins also served as the Managing Editor for Psychometrika, the Psychometric Society’s publication, from 1950 to 1956. After these assignments ended, she continued to serve as a member of the Board of Trustees as well as a Representative on the Inner-Association Council on Test Reviewing for the Psychometric Society from 1969-1972. \n\nOn they way back from a trip in 1968, Adkins stopped in Hawaii to visit friends and fell in love with the Islands. When she was given the opportunity to teach and research at the University of Hawaii in Educational Psychology she accepted. While at the University of Hawaii, Adkins was made Director of the Center for Research in Early Childhood Education. She was only able to stay in Hawaii until 1974, at which time complicated and ongoing medical conditions forced her to return home to the mainland U.S. \n\nGumpgookies was a method of assessing child motivation to achieve in school, which Adkins created along with Bonnie Baliff. In this method, a child had to choose which of two imaginary Gumpgookie characters he or she identified with. [3] A child choosing one character over another indicated different levels of motivation. This method was used in the Head Start program evaluation in 1968-1969. \n\nOver the course of her career, Adkins because interested in new (at the time) statistical techniques of factor analysis. She applied factor analytic techniques in order to examine and better understand curriculum, program evaluation, and affect in children. She published several books examining measurement and analysis in education and achievement tests. \n\nEvidence of Adkins influence on the field of achievement testing can be seen in the years surrounding the publication of her 1947 book Construction and Analysis of Achievement Tests. In the first 10 years after publication this book was cited 55 times, with a total of 152 citations, the most recent citation in 2014. Google Ngram can be used to view the number of times the phrase “education testing” was used in books in the 20 years prior to and after the publication of Adkins book. Prior to the publication there was a slight decline in the used of the phrase, however after its publication, there was a steady increase in use of the phrase. Following the same trend (but to a lesser degree) the same post publication trend can be seen with a search of “Dorothy Adkins” name. \n\nA full list of her papers are held by the Archives of the History of American Psychology at the University of Akron.\n\nWhile at the university of North Carolina, Adkins was again colleagues with L.L Thurstone. She became dear friends with Thurstone and his wife, Thelma Thurstone, a friendship that lasted many years. Adkins was highly regarded by her students and colleges. She was known as a precise, dedicated, and excellent teacher, never unprepared for a lecture or meeting. To her friends, Adkins was known as compassionate, though she was always busy. She was known to take time to cook homemade meals/desserts or pick flowers from her garden to bring to friends who were ill. Adkins enjoyed travel, concerts, parties and games. She had two Weimaraner dogs that she loved dearly. In June of 1974 Adkins retired from University of Hawaii to Plain City, Ohio for medical reasons. She eventually wanted to return to teaching at Chapel Hill, but her health never permitted. On December 19th, 1975 Dorothy Adkins passed away in her home near her family. In 1976 Thelma Thurstone wrote a biography/memoir for Adkins, which was published in Psychometrika. \n"}

At the time of its passage, the Act consolidated much legislation on workplace health, safety and welfare in Great Britain. Though some of it remains in force, it has largely been superseded by the Health and Safety at Work etc. Act 1974 and regulations made under it.\n\nHowever, the Act continues to have a legal importance as cases of chronic workplace exposure to hazards such as industrial noise, as in the Nottinghamshire and Derbyshire deafness litigation, or carcinogens often extend back in time beyond the current legislation.\n\nBreach of the residual provisions is still a crime punishable on summary conviction in the Magistrates' Court by a fine of up to £20,000 or, on indictment in the Crown Court, imprisonment for up to two years and an unlimited fine. \n\nIn the event of damage arising from a breach of the Act, there may be civil liability for breach of statutory duty. Though no such liability is stipulated by the Act itself, none is excluded and the facts could be such as to give rise to a cause of action in that tort. A breach not actionable in itself may be evidential towards a claim for common law negligence. In particular, a criminal conviction may be given in evidence.\n\nThe Act was the final consolidation of a line of legislation under Factory Acts that began in 1802. In particular, it consolidated the 1937 and 1959 Acts. The Acts were widely regarded as ineffective in practice. Section 14 of the 1961 Act required the guarding of all dangerous parts of machinery but a sequence of judicial decisions under the earlier Acts had restricted the scope of what was \"dangerous\" only to include hazards that were reasonable foreseeable.\n\nSection 175 of the Act defines \"factory\" as premises in which persons are employed in manual labour in any process for or incidental to:\n\n\nThe Act also defines certain other specific premises as \"factories\" such as laundries and printing works (s. 175(2)).\n\nSections 1 to 7 define general broad requirements for healthy factory working conditions:\n\n\nThese provisions were repealed and superseded, as far as they applied to \"workplaces\", by the Workplace (Health, Safety and Welfare) Regulations 1992 with effect from 1 January 1993 for new workplaces and 1 January 1996 for established workplaces.

{"id": "1526027", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1526027", "title": "Fat Thursday", "text": "Fat Thursday\n\nFat Thursday is a traditional Christian feast marking the last Thursday before Lent and is associated with the celebration of Carnival. Because Lent is a time of fasting, the next opportunity to feast would not be until Laetare Sunday, and after that not until Easter. Traditionally it is a day dedicated to eating, when people meet in their homes or cafés with their friends and relatives and eat large quantities of sweets, cakes and other meals usually not eaten during Lent. Among the most popular all-national dishes served on that day are pączki in Poland or berliner, fist-sized donuts filled with rose marmalade, and angel wings (faworki), French dough fingers served with powdered sugar.\n\n\"Weiberfastnacht\" is an unofficial holiday in the Rhineland. At the majority of workplaces, work ends before noon. Celebrations start at 11:11 am. In comparison with Rosenmontag, there are hardly any parades, but people wear costumes and celebrate in pubs and in the streets. \"Beueler Weiberfastnacht\" (\"women's carnival in Beuel\") is traditionally celebrated In the Bonn district of Beuel. The tradition is said to have started here in 1824, when local women first formed their own \"carnival committee\". The symbolic storming of the Beuel town hall is broadcast live on TV. In many towns across the state of North Rhine Westphalia, a ritual \"takeover\" of the town halls by local women has become tradition. Among other established customs, on that day women cut off the ties of men, which are seen as a symbol of men's status. The men wear the stumps of their ties and get a \"Bützchen\" (little kiss) as compensation.\n\nGreeks celebrate \"Tsiknopempti\", which literally means \"Thursday of the Smoke of Grilled Meat\". It is celebrated 11 days before Clean Monday (which marks the start of the fasting period of Lent); since the week before Lent is considered meat-free (but not dairy-free), and Wednesday and Friday are generally considered days of fasting in the Greek-Orthodox Christian tradition, this makes Tsiknopempti one of the last opportunities for people to eat meat, so this has traditionally led to the day acquiring a special festive character. Greeks celebrate by taking to the streets and consuming large quantities of grilled meat, such as souvlaki. Many local town councils set up grills in central squares with music and festivities.\n\n\"Giovedì grasso\" (Fat Thursday) is celebrated in Italy, but it is not very different from \"martedì grasso\" (Shrove Tuesday). In Venice at the turn into the twentieth century, for example, it was marked by \"masquerades, a battle of flowers on the Plaza, a general illumination and the opening of the lottery\". The English writer Marie Corelli mentioned \"Giovedi Grasso\" in her second novel, \"Vendetta\" (1886), as a day when \"the fooling and the mumming, the dancing, shrieking, and screaming would be at its height.\"\n\nIn Poland, Fat Thursday is called Tłusty Czwartek. People purchase their favorite pastries from their local bakeries. Traditional foods include pączki, which are large deep-fried pieces of especially rich dough, traditionally filled with plum or rose hip jam (though others are commonly used) and topped with powdered sugar, icing, or glaze.\n\nIn Spain this celebration is called \"jueves lardero\", and in Catalan-speaking areas, \"dijous gras\", a children's holiday. In Albacete in central Spain, \"jueves lardero\" is celebrated with a square pastry called a \"bizcocho\" (see also Bizcocho) and a round pastry called a \"mona\". In Aragon a meal is prepared with a special from Graus while in Catalonia the tradition is to eat sweet Bunyols and .\n\nIn Sweden this celebration is called \"Fettisdagen\" (\"The Fat Tuesday\") is the Swedish name for the Tuesday after the Quinquagesima and the day between Shrove Monday and Ash Wednesday. Because it is the last day before the Lenten fast, a tradition has developed of eating buns, called \"fastlagsbullar\", \"fettisdagsbullar\" (Fat Tuesday Buns) or \"semla\". The day is also called \"White Tuesday\" because the buns are made out of white flour.\n\nThe day is called \"Mardi Gras\" in France, \"Carnaval\" or \"Vastenavond\" in the Netherlands, \"laskiainen\"/\"fastlagstisdagen\" in Finland, \"vastlapäev\" in Estonia, and \"Fastelavn\" in Denmark. In the UK it is known as Shrove Tuesday or Pancake Day.\n\nSyrian Catholics have celebrated the day as \"Drunkard's Thursday\" with dolmas as the traditional food.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "27486969", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=27486969", "title": "Food safety-risk analysis", "text": "Food safety-risk analysis\n\nA food safety-risk analysis is essential not only to produce or manufacture high quality goods and products to ensure safety and protect public health, but also to comply with international and national standards and market regulations. With risk analyses food safety systems can be strengthened and food-borne illnesses can be reduced. Food safety risk analyses focus on major safety concerns in manufacturing premises—not every safety issue requires a formal risk analysis. Sometimes, especially for complex or controversial analyses, regular staff is supported by independent consultants. \n\nRisk analysis is defined for the purposes of the Codex Alimentarius Commission as \"A process consisting of three components: risk management, risk assessment, and risk communication.\" \n\nRisk management is defined for the purposes of the Codex Alimentarius Commission as \"The process, distinct from risk assessment, of weighing policy alternatives, in consultation with all interested parties, considering risk assessment and other factors relevant for the health protection of consumers and for the promotion of fair trade practices, and, if needed, selecting appropriate prevention and control options.\" \n\nAs defined by the Codex Alimentarius Commission and adopted by international food safety commissions, food safety risk assessment is \"The scientific evaluation of known or potential adverse health effects resulting from human exposure to foodborne hazards.\" The most important aspect of risk assessment in relation to food safety is that it should be rooted in scientific data. Sources of data should be assembled in a systematic manner and should stem from valid scientific studies and communities across the world. A proper risk assessment can be described as being objective and unbiased, with absolute transparency. When at all possible, the assessment should remain independent of risk management as to preserve the integrity of the science and not have influence from regulatory policy and values. All assumptions made throughout the assessment should be well documented by the risk manager and should strive to be as objective, biologically realistic, and consistent as possible. As with any risk assessment performed, incomplete data or gaps in information create degrees of variability and uncertainty. In accounting for these factors, an extensive description of uncertainties in the risk estimate and their origins should be provided, as well as, descriptions of how assumptions being made can increase or decrease the uncertainty of results in the risk assessment. To increase the validity of a risk assessment, it is recommended that the assessment remain open for peer review and editing by food safety and science communities. A proper risk assessment is a constantly revolving process consisting of the following steps: (i) hazard identification, (ii) hazard characterization, (iii) exposure assessment, and (iv) risk characterization.\n\n\"The identification of biological, chemical, and physical agents capable of causing adverse health effects and which may be present in a particular food or group of foods.\" This is often considered the most important step in a risk assessment as an unidentified hazard in the early stages of the production process can cause devastating effects in later stages.\n\n\"The qualitative and/or quantitative evaluation of the nature of the adverse health effects associated with biological, chemical and physical agents which may be present in food. For chemical agents, a dose-response assessment should be performed. For biological or physical agents, a dose-response assessment should be performed if the data are obtainable.\" In this stage, risk assessors should describe the nature and extent of the adverse health effects known to be associated with the specific hazard.

{"id": "12243", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=12243", "title": "Gadolinium", "text": "Gadolinium\n\nGadolinium is a chemical element with symbol Gd and atomic number 64. Gadolinium is a silvery-white, malleable, and ductile rare earth metal. It is found in nature only in oxidized form, and even when separated, it usually has impurities of the other rare earths. Gadolinium was discovered in 1880 by Jean Charles de Marignac, who detected its oxide by using spectroscopy. It is named after the mineral gadolinite, one of the minerals in which gadolinium is found, itself named for the chemist Johan Gadolin. Pure gadolinium was first isolated by the chemist Paul Emile Lecoq de Boisbaudran around 1886.\n\nGadolinium possesses unusual metallurgical properties, to the extent that as little as 1% of gadolinium can significantly improve the workability and resistance to oxidation at high temperatures of iron, chromium, and related metals. Gadolinium as a metal or a salt absorbs neutrons and is, therefore, used sometimes for shielding in neutron radiography and in nuclear reactors.\n\nLike most of the rare earths, gadolinium forms trivalent ions with fluorescent properties, and salts of gadolinium(III) are used as phosphors in various applications.\n\nThe kinds of gadolinium(III) ions occurring in water-soluble salts are toxic to mammals. However, chelated gadolinium(III) compounds are far less toxic because they carry gadolinium(III) through the kidneys and out of the body before the free ion can be released into the tissues. Because of its paramagnetic properties, solutions of chelated organic gadolinium complexes are used as intravenously administered gadolinium-based MRI contrast agents in medical magnetic resonance imaging.\n\nGadolinium is a silvery-white malleable and ductile rare earth metal. It crystallizes in the hexagonal close-packed α-form at room temperature, but, when heated to temperatures above 1235 °C, it transforms into its β-form, which has a body-centered cubic structure.\n\nThe isotope gadolinium-157 has the highest thermal-neutron capture cross-section among any stable nuclide: about 259,000 barns. Only xenon-135 has a higher capture cross-section, about 2.0 million barns, but this isotope is radioactive.\n\nGadolinium is believed to be ferromagnetic at temperatures below and is strongly paramagnetic above this temperature. There is evidence that gadolinium is a helical antiferromagnetic, rather than a ferromagnetic, below . Gadolinium demonstrates a magnetocaloric effect whereby its temperature increases when it enters a magnetic field and decreases when it leaves the magnetic field. The temperature is lowered to for the gadolinium alloy GdEr, and this effect is considerably stronger for the alloy Gd(SiGe), but at a much lower temperature (<). A significant magnetocaloric effect is observed at higher temperatures, up to about 300 kelvins, in the compounds Gd(SiGe).\n\nIndividual gadolinium atoms can be isolated by encapsulating them into fullerene molecules, where they can be visualized with transmission electron microscope. Individual Gd atoms and small Gd clusters can be incorporated into carbon nanotubes.\n\nGadolinium combines with most elements to form Gd(III) derivatives. It also combines with nitrogen, carbon, sulfur, phosphorus, boron, selenium, silicon, and arsenic at elevated temperatures, forming binary compounds.\n\nUnlike the other rare-earth elements, metallic gadolinium is relatively stable in dry air. However, it tarnishes quickly in moist air, forming a loosely-adhering gadolinium(III) oxide (GdO):\nwhich spalls off, exposing more surface to oxidation.\n\nGadolinium is a strong reducing agent, which reduces oxides of several metals into their elements. Gadolinium is quite electropositive and reacts slowly with cold water and quite quickly with hot water to form gadolinium hydroxide:\n\nGadolinium metal is attacked readily by dilute sulfuric acid to form solutions containing the colorless Gd(III) ions, which exist as [Gd(HO)] complexes:\n\nGadolinium metal reacts with the halogens (X) at temperature about 200 °C:\n\nIn the great majority of its compounds, gadolinium adopts the oxidation state +3. All four trihalides are known. All are white, except for the iodide, which is yellow. Most commonly encountered of the halides is gadolinium(III) chloride (GdCl). The oxide dissolves in acids to give the salts, such as gadolinium(III) nitrate.\n\nGadolinium(III), like most lanthanide ions, forms complexes with high coordination numbers. This tendency is illustrated by the use of the chelating agent DOTA, an octadentate ligand. Salts of [Gd(DOTA)] are useful in magnetic resonance imaging. A variety of related chelate complexes have been developed, including gadodiamide.\n\nReduced gadolinium compounds are known, especially in the solid state. Gadolinium(II) halides are obtained by heating Gd(III) halides in presence of metallic Gd in tantalum containers. Gadolinium also form sesquichloride GdCl, which can be further reduced to GdCl by annealing at 800 °C. This gadolinium(I) chloride forms platelets with layered graphite-like structure.\n\nNaturally occurring gadolinium is composed of six stable isotopes, Gd, Gd, Gd, Gd, Gd and Gd, and one radioisotope, Gd, with the isotope Gd being the most abundant (24.84% natural abundance). The predicted double beta decay of Gd has never been observed (the only lower limit on its half-life of more than 1.3×10 years has been set experimentally).\n\n29 radioisotopes of gadolinium have been observed, with the most stable being Gd (naturally occurring), with a half-life of about 1.08×10 years, and Gd, with a half-life of 1.79×10 years. All of the remaining radioactive isotopes have half-lives of less than 75 years. The majority of these have half-lives of less than 25 seconds. Gadolinium isotopes have four metastable isomers, with the most stable being Gd (\"t\" = 110 seconds), Gd (\"t\" = 85 seconds) and Gd (\"t\" = 24.5 seconds).\n\nThe isotopes with atomic masses lower than the most abundant stable isotope, Gd, primarily decay by electron capture to isotopes of europium. At higher atomic masses, the primary decay mode is beta decay, and the primary products are isotopes of terbium.\n\nGadolinium is named from the mineral gadolinite, in turn named for Finnish chemist and geologist Johan Gadolin.\nIn 1880, the Swiss chemist Jean Charles Galissard de Marignac observed the spectroscopic lines from gadolinium in samples of gadolinite (which actually contains relatively little gadolinium, but enough to show a spectrum) and in the separate mineral cerite. The latter mineral proved to contain far more of the element with the new spectral line. De Marignac eventually separated a mineral oxide from cerite, which he realized was the oxide of this new element. He named the oxide \"gadolinia\". Because he realized that \"gadolinia\" was the oxide of a new element, he is credited with discovery of gadolinium. The French chemist Paul Émile Lecoq de Boisbaudran carried out the separation of gadolinium metal from gadolinia in 1886.\n\nGadolinium is a constituent in many minerals such as monazite and bastnäsite, which are oxides. The metal is too reactive to exist naturally. Paradoxically, as noted above, the mineral gadolinite actually contains only traces of this element. The abundance in the Earth's crust is about 6.2 mg/kg. The main mining areas are in China, the US, Brazil, Sri Lanka, India, and Australia with reserves expected to exceed one million tonnes. World production of pure gadolinium is about 400 tonnes per year. The only known mineral with essential gadolinium, lepersonnite-(Gd), is very rare.\n\nGadolinium is produced both from monazite and bastnäsite.\n\nGadolinium metal is obtained from its oxide or salts by heating it with calcium at 1450 °C in an argon atmosphere. Sponge gadolinium can be produced by reducing molten GdCl with an appropriate metal at temperatures below 1312 °C (the melting point of Gd) at a reduced pressure.\n\nGadolinium has no large-scale applications, but it has a variety of specialized uses.\n\nBecause Gd has a high neutron cross-section, it is used to target tumors in neutron therapy. This element is effective for use with neutron radiography and in shielding of nuclear reactors. It is used as a secondary, emergency shut-down measure in some nuclear reactors, particularly of the CANDU reactor type. Gadolinium is also used in nuclear marine propulsion systems as a burnable poison.\n\nGadolinium possesses unusual metallurgic properties, with as little as 1% of gadolinium improving the workability and resistance of iron, chromium, and related alloys to high temperatures and oxidation.\n\nGadolinium is paramagnetic at room temperature, with a ferromagnetic Curie point of 20 °C. Paramagnetic ions, such as gadolinium, enhance nuclear relaxation rates, making gadolinium useful for magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Solutions of organic gadolinium complexes and gadolinium compounds are used as intravenous MRI contrast agent to enhance images in medical magnetic resonance imaging and magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) procedures. Magnevist is the most widespread example. Nanotubes packed with gadolinium, called \"gadonanotubes\", are 40 times more effective than the usual gadolinium contrast agent. Once injected, gadolinium-based contrast agents accumulate in abnormal tissues of the brain and body, which provides a greater image contrast between normal and abnormal tissues, facilitating location of abnormal cell growths and tumors.\n\nGadolinium as a phosphor is also used in other imaging. In X-ray systems gadolinium is contained in the phosphor layer, suspended in a polymer matrix at the detector. Terbium-doped gadolinium oxysulfide (GdOS:Tb) at the phosphor layer converts the X-rays released from the source into light. This material emits green light at 540 nm due to the presence of Tb, which is very useful for enhancing the imaging quality. The energy conversion of Gd is up to 20%, which means that 1/5 of the X-ray energy striking the phosphor layer can be converted into visible photons. Gadolinium oxyorthosilicate (GdSiO, GSO; usually doped by 0.1–1% of Ce) is a single crystal that is used as a scintillator in medical imaging such as positron emission tomography or for detecting neutrons.\n\nGadolinium compounds are also used for making green phosphors for color TV tubes.\n\nGadolinium-153 is produced in a nuclear reactor from elemental europium or enriched gadolinium targets. It has a half-life of days and emits gamma radiation with strong peaks at 41 keV and 102 keV. It is used in many quality-assurance applications, such as line sources and calibration phantoms, to ensure that nuclear-medicine imaging systems operate correctly and produce useful images of radioisotope distribution inside the patient. It is also used as a gamma-ray source in X-ray absorption measurements or in bone density gauges for osteoporosis screening, as well as in the Lixiscope portable X-ray imaging system.\n\nGadolinium is used for making gadolinium yttrium garnet (Gd:YAlO); it has microwave applications and is used in fabrication of various optical components and as substrate material for magneto-optical films.\n\nGadolinium gallium garnet (GGG, GdGaO) was used for imitation diamonds and for computer bubble memory.\n\nGadolinium can also serve as an electrolyte in solid oxide fuel cells (SOFCs). Using gadolinium as a dopant for materials like cerium oxide (in the form of gadolinium-doped ceria) creates an electrolyte with both high ionic conductivity and low operating temperatures, which are optimal for cost-effective production of fuel cells.\n\nResearch is being conducted on magnetic refrigeration near room temperature, which could provide significant efficiency and environmental advantages over conventional refrigeration methods. Gadolinium-based materials, such as Gd(SiGe), are currently the most promising materials, owing to their high Curie temperature and giant magnetocaloric effect. Pure Gd itself exhibits a large magnetocaloric effect near its Curie temperature of 20 °C, and this has sparked great interest into producing Gd alloys with a larger effect and tunable Curie temperature. In Gd(SiGe), Si and Ge compositions can be varied to adjust the Curie temperature. This technology is still very early in development, and significant material improvements still need to be made before it is commercially viable.\n\nGadolinium has no known native biological role, but its compounds are used as research tools in biomedicine. Gd compounds are components of MRI contrast agents. It is used in various ion channel electrophysiology experiments to block sodium leak channels and stretch activated ion channels. Gadolinium has recently been used to measure the distance between two points in a protein via electron paramagnetic resonance, something that gadolinium is especially amenable to thanks to EPR sensitivity at w-band (95 GHz) frequencies. \n\nAs a free ion, gadolinium is reported often to be highly toxic, but MRI contrast agents are chelated compounds and are considered safe enough to be used in most persons. The toxicity of free gadolinium ions in animals is due to interference with a number of calcium-ion channel dependent processes. The 50% lethal dose is about 100–200 mg/kg. Toxicities have not been reported following low dose exposure to gadolinium ions. Toxicity studies in rodents, however show that chelation of gadolinium (which also improves its solubility) decreases its toxicity with regard to the free ion by at least a factor of 100 (i.e., the lethal dose for the Gd-chelate increases by 100 times). It is believed therefore that clinical toxicity of gadolinium-based contrast agents (GBCAs) in humans will depend on the strength of the chelating agent; however this research is still not complete. About a dozen different Gd-chelated agents have been approved as MRI contrast agents around the world.\n\nGBCAs have proved safer than the iodinated contrast agents used in X-ray radiography or computed tomography. Anaphylactoid reactions are rare, occurring in approximately 0.03–0.1%.\n\nAlthough gadolinium agents are useful for patients with renal impairment, in patients with severe renal failure requiring dialysis, there is a risk of a rare but serious illness called nephrogenic systemic fibrosis (NSF) or nephrogenic fibrosing dermopathy, that is linked to the use of MRI contrast agents containing gadolinium. The disease resembles scleromyxedema and to some extent scleroderma. It may occur months after a contrast agent has been injected. Its association with gadolinium and not the carrier molecule is confirmed by its occurrence with various contrast materials in which gadolinium is carried by very different carrier molecules. Due to this, it is not recommended to use these agents for any individual with end-stage renal failure as they will require emergent dialysis. Similar but not identical symptoms to NSF may occur in subjects with normal or near normal renal function within hours to 2 months following the administration of GBCAs; the name \"gadolinium deposition disease\" (GDD) has been proposed for this condition, which occurs in the absence of pre-existent disease or subsequently developed disease of an alternate known process. A 2016 study reported numerous anecdotal cases of GDD. However, in that study, participants were recruited from online support groups for subjects self-identified as having gadolinium toxicity, and no relevant medical history or data were collected. There have yet to be definitive scientific studies proving the existence of the condition. In addition, gadolinium deposition in neural tissues has solely been demonstrated in patients with inflammatory, infective, or malignant disease, and no healthy volunteer studies have assessed the potential of gadolinium deposition within the brain, skin, or bones.\n\nIncluded in the current guidelines from the Canadian Association of Radiologists are that dialysis patients should only receive gadolinium agents where essential and that they should receive dialysis after the exam. If a contrast-enhanced MRI must be performed on a dialysis patient, it is recommended that certain high-risk contrast agents be avoided but not that a lower dose be considered. The American College of Radiology recommends that contrast-enhanced MRI examinations be performed as closely before dialysis as possible as a precautionary measure, although this has not been proven to reduce the likelihood of developing NSF. The FDA recommends that potential for gadolinium retention be considered when choosing the type of GBCA used in patients requiring multiple lifetime doses, pregnant women, children, and patients with inflammatory conditions.\n\nLong-term environmental impacts of gadolinium contamination due to human usage is a topic of ongoing research.\n\n"}

{"id": "12739077", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=12739077", "title": "Healing of periapical lesions", "text": "Healing of periapical lesions\n\nApical periodontitis is typically the body’s defense response to the threat of microbial invasion from the root canal. Primary among the members of the host defense mechanism is the polymorphonuclear leukocyte, otherwise known as the neutrophil. The task of the neutrophil is to locate and destroy microbes that intrude into the body – anywhere in the body – and they represent the hallmark of acute inflammation.\n\nIn response to tissue injury, neutrophils leave the circulatory system in great numbers and gather at the site of tissue injury. They are drawn to the site by chemotaxis, following a concentration gradient of chemotactic molecules until they reach the site of greatest concentration: the site of injury and microbial presence. Once there, the antimicrobial action of superoxide and hydrogen peroxide, derived from the metabolic processes of the neutrophils, act to combat the microbial invasion. While primarily mobilized to kill the invading microorganisms, the neutrophils actually cause a significant amount of host tissue damage as well. Although the neutrophils themselves rarely remain alive for more than a few days, the excessive accumulation of dead neutrophils and the enzymes they released is a major cause of tissue breakdown in the acute phases of apical periodontitis.\n\nSoon after inflammation has been initiated, macrophages enter the scene and, if not controlled by the initial ambush of neutrophils and their tactics, the microbial invasion is faced with a second strike consisting of these leukocytes, along with lymphocytes. Together, the cells of this second strike compose the bulk of the apical periodontitis lesion and serve an important role in the subsequent chronic phase of inflammation of apical periodontitis, as they can live for many months. Some researchers posit that it must not be macrophages that are involved, as they could not appropriately discriminate between the varied array of opsonized entities as necessary, and that, in reality, the properties ascribed to the macrophage in the initiation phase of the inflammatory response actually belong to the lymphatic dendritic cell. It is unclear, however, if the latter is a distinct population of cells or if it is merely a particularly specialized strain of macrophage.\n\nWhen infections such as these occur elsewhere in the body, the host defense system, able to travel the body via the circulatory system, is, more often than not, capable of appropriately gaining access to the site of infection in order to mount a proper and successful retaliation. Dental pulp, which is a richly vascularized and innervated tissue, is enclosed by tissues, such as dentin, which are incapable of expanding. It has terminal blood flow and possesses only small-gauge circulatory access at the apical foramen. All of these characteristics severely constrain the defensive capacity of the pulp tissue when faced with the different aggressions to which it may be subjected. As a result, necrotic tissue located within the pulp chamber and canals provide nutrients for pathogenic bacteria to grow and form a periapical lesion; the infected tooth serves as a biochemically and physiologically ideal location for bacterial growth and maturation, and, in essence, acts as a refuge from which bacterial reinforcements can mobilize to the periapical lesion. It is this concept that serves as the basis for conventional endodontic therapy; both chemical and mechanical debridement procedures are essential in effectively disrupting and removing the microbial ecosystem that is associated with the disease process. Thus, whenever a pulp is removed and the canal treated and filled in a manner that is compatible with or favorable to a physiologic reaction, we may expect a satisfactory percentage of endodontic success.\n\nIn 1890, W.D. Miller, considered the father of oral microbiology, was the first to associate pulpal disease with the presence of bacteria. This was confirmed by Kakehashi, who, in 1965, proved that bacteria were the cause of pulpal and periradicular disease in studies using animal models; pulpal exposures were initiated in both normal and germ-free rats, and while no pathologic changes were exhibited in the mouths of the germ-free rats, introduction of the normal oral microbial flora produced pulpal necrosis and led to periradicular lesion formation in the normal rats. The germ-free rats healed regardless of the severity of pulpal exposure, demonstrating that the presence or absence of bacteria was the determinant for pulpal and periapical disease.\n\nMoreover, it has since been discovered that endodontic infections are polymicrobial. In fact, the bacteria present within endodontic infections are thoroughly similar to the bacteria that are involved in periodontal disease. It has also been shown that certain enzymes produced by bacteria are detrimental to the host, and can work in concert with the destructive capability of the enzymes released by dying neutrophils. Recent studies have revealed that the gene for collagenases could be detected in stains of \"Porphyromonas gingivalis\", one of the many endodontic infective agents that are also involved in periodontal disease.\n\nAdditionally, it has been proven that a positive correlation exists between the number of bacteria in an infected root canal and the size of the resultant periradicular radiolucency.\n\nIn attempting to resolve a periapical lesion of endodontic origin, it is essential to be conscious of these principles in order to effectively combat the infection. Without proper consideration for the causes, the pulpal and periapical infection cannot be suitably treated, for effective patient management requires the correct diagnosis and removal of the cause of the infection of endodontic origin to correct the associated periapical lesion. Because periapical disease is almost inevitably preceded by pulp disease, proper chemomechanical debridement of the infected root canals, together with incision and drainage of associated periradicular swellings, will usually allow for rapid improvement in patient signs and symptoms. The same end can be accomplished by extracting the involved tooth.\n\nAlthough periapical changes will be in response to pulpal changes the majority of the time, it is still important to determine the disease process sequence. When the disease process is of pulpal origin, the pulpal infection and necrosis may drain not only through the apical foramen, but also through an accessory canal, which may present radiographically as a periradicular or furcation radiolucency. This may further lead to furcal involvement through loss of clinical attachment and alveolar bone. A cursory clinical examination and radiographic analysis can easily lead the clinician off the right course and pulpal involvement might be overlooked when the tooth is asymptomatic. Similarly, a periodontal abscess may very well appear to be pulpal in origin, when in fact it is not. Notwithstanding the tissue of origin, though, when it is determined that there is a pulpal involvement to the periodontal lesion, the endodontic infection should be controlled prior to beginning definitive management of the periodontal lesion, especially when regenerative or bone grafting techniques are planned.\n\nTo achieve healing of the periapical lesion, one must obtain and maintain a decontaminated root canal system. \"System\" is to be emphasized, because the root canal system does not merely consist of tapering cone-shaped canals from orifice to apex, but rather, can and often is an intricate labyrinth of canals that diverge and weave to form an elaborate web of anastomosing passages. It is precisely because of this reality that “it is important to appreciate that files produce shape, but it is essential to understand that irrigants clean [the] root canal system. Copious amounts of sodium hypochlorite are necessary to utterly dissolve all remnants of pulp tissue as well as completely destroy all microorganisms. The tooth stability does not undergo major changes after surgery comparated with the initial value which was determined before establishing any kind of treatment.\n\nMany authoritative clinicians and researchers advise completing endodontic therapy as soon as possible, especially in situations necessitating incision and drainage, in order to remove the cause of infection without delay. Recent studies have shown, however, that intracanal application of certain medicaments prior to the completion of endodontic therapy may produce highly favorable results when followed by conventional therapy, even when the periapical area is very large. The use of chlorhexidine gluconate and calcium hydroxide for infection control was shown to lead to substantial healing of a large periapical lesion.\n\nThe traditional thought that it is necessary to complete endodontic therapy as quickly as possible may be related only to the initial steps of therapy, namely, a thorough instrumentation, thus ensuring a proper biomechanical preparation. While completion of the procedure with immediate obturation might secure the decontaminated root canal system, delaying this step in order to allow for application of medicaments has been shown to be beneficial. Periodic application and renewal of calcium hydroxide over a year’s time (four applications over a 12-month period), has been shown to represent a nonsurgical approach to resolving even extensive inflammatory periapical lesions.\n\nThe use of adjunctive antibiotics is usually uncalled for when proper debridement procedures can be executed in a conventional periapical lesion of endodontic origin; however, they can be centrally important to the treatment of a progressive or persistent infection. It has been proposed, however, that disinfection of the root canal by means of an antibacterial agent, such as propolis or otosporin, can lead to improved healing by reducing and controlling pulpal and periapical inflammatory reactions. This would, in turn, promote the healing process as well as provide for better control, prevention and reduction of post-treatment pain and discomfort.\n\nThere are a number of active biologic mediators that have been implicated in promoting apical resorption. Matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs), which are endogenous zinc-dependent catabolic enzymes, are primarily responsible for the degradation of much of the tissue matrices built on such architecturally important substances as collagen and proteoglycan core proteins. Their biologic activities have been extensively researched and reviewed, and their importance in the pathogenesis of apical periodontitis is obvious. Furthermore, concentrations of IgG antibodies have been found to be nearly five times higher in lesions of apical periodontitis than in uninflamed oral mucosa.\n\nProstaglandins, specifically PGE2 and PGI2, are important in inflammation and have been implicated in promoting apical resorption. This is because neutrophils, which are rich sources of PGE2, are present when the majority of rapid bone loss occurs during the initial stages of apical periodontitis. It has been illustrated clinically that parenteral administration of indomethacin, an inhibitor of cyclooxygenase, can act to suppress resorption of apical hard tissue.\n\nThe predominant mechanism of bone resorption in a periapical lesion, as in the rest of the body, is the performed by osteoclasts. In the periapical lesion, mediators that are normally produced primarily only by osteoblasts are released by many other cells as well, overstimulating proosteoclasts. As a result, these begin to proliferate and several cells fuse to form multinucleated giant cells capable of spreading over the infected, injured site and cause resorption of the periapical alveolar bone.\n\nIt is possible that after conventional endodontic therapy has been completed, little to no resolution of the periapical lesion occurs over a considerable amount of time; there is a great deal of current research that discusses the possible reasons for this outcome and suggests possible treatment options. For example, it has been demonstrated that there is an association between nonresolving apical periodontitis lesions and the presence of cholesterol clefts within the periapical lesion; in fact, an incidence of up to 44% has been reported! It was shown that macrophages joined to form multinucleated giant cells and then produced a well-circumscribed area of tissue reaction, not unlike the granulomatous tissue reactions of a typical foreign body reaction, and persisted for up to 8 months. Similarly, endodontic materials as well as food debris may also be the cause of persistent periapical lesions. It was once shown that contaminated gutta percha resulted in a persistent periapical lesion for more than a decade!\n\nFor retreatment of a non-healing lesion, there is really no magical method that can be employed; the course of action is merely to achieve what was supposed to have been achieved the first time. Keeping in mind the notion that endodontic retreatment is a problem-solving exploit will substantially increase its success.\n\nAfter endodontic therapy has been executed, or re-executed, successfully, and the canals can no longer provide a nutrient-rich habitat for microbes, the issue of bone healing comes into focus. Ostensibly, then, for regeneration to occur, the root canal system must have been decontaminated and further access to microbial invasion must be prohibited. Regeneration of the bone has been demonstrated to occur, on average, at a rate of 3.2 mm² per month, and studies suggest that 71% of lesions have achieved complete resolution one year post-operatively.\n\nSituations in which a surgical form of retreatment had been selected and in which apical resolution has still not occurred may still benefit from additional surgical intervention. A comparison of the outcome of periradicular surgery in teeth that had previously undergone surgical treatment versus teeth that were undergoing a surgical procedure for the first time showed that, after 5 years, 86% of surgically treated teeth healed with complete bone filling of the surgical cavity while only 59% of resurgically treated teeth healed with complete bone filling. It has thus been demonstrated that surgical retreatment of teeth previously treated with surgery is a valid alternative to extraction.\n\nHowever, a combination of three antibiotics (metronidazole, ciprofloxacin, and minocycline) in a paste has been used successfully to treat these lesions non-surgically.\n"}

The healthcare error proliferation model explains the etiology of error and the sequence of events typically leading to adverse outcomes. This model emphasizes the role organizational and external cultures contribute to error identification, prevention, mitigation, and defense construction.\n\nHealthcare systems are \"complex\" in that they are diverse in both structure (e.g. nursing units, pharmacies, emergency departments, operating rooms) and professional mix (e.g. nurses, physicians, pharmacists, administrators, therapists) and made up of multiple interconnected elements with \"adaptive\" tendencies in that they have the capacity to change and learn from experience. The term \"complex adaptive systems\" (CAS) was coined at the interdisciplinary Santa Fe Institute (SFI), by John H. Holland, and Murray Gell-Mann. Subsequently, scholars such as Ruth A. Anderson, Rubin McDaniels, and Paul Cilliers have extended CAS theory and research to the social sciences such as education and healthcare.\n\nThe healthcare error proliferation model (HEPM) adapts the Swiss Cheese Model to the complexity of healthcare delivery systems and integrated organizations. The Swiss Cheese Model, likens the complex adaptive system to multiple hole infested slices of Swiss cheese positioned side-by-side. The cheese slices are dubbed defensive layers to describe their role and function as the system location outfitted with features capable of intercepting and deflecting hazards. The layers represent discrete locations or organizational levels potentially populated with errors permitting error progression. The four layers include: 1) organizational leadership, 2) risky supervision, 3) situations for unsafe practices, and 4) unsafe performance.\n\nThe HEPM portrays hospitals as having multiple operational defensive layers outfitted with essential elements necessary to maintain key defensive barricades (Cook & O'Connor, 2005; Reason, 2000). By examining the defensive layers attributes, prospective locales of failure, the etiology of accidents might be revealed (Leape et al., 1995). Experts have discussed the importance of examining these layers within the context of the complex adaptive healthcare system (Kohn et al., 2000; Wiegmann & Shappell, 2003) and considering the psychological safety of clinicians. Hence, this model expands Reason’s seminal work.\n\nThe model incorporates the complex adaptive healthcare system as a key characteristic. Complex adaptive systems characteristically demonstrate self-organization as diverse agents interact spontaneously in nonlinear relationships where professionals act as information processors (Cilliers, 1998; McDaniel & Driebe, 2001) and co-evolve with the environment (Casti, 1997). Healthcare professionals function in the system as diverse actors within the complex environment utilizing different methods to process information (Coleman, 1999) and solve systemic problems within and across organizational layers (McDaniel & Driebe, 2001).\n\nA complex adaptive healthcare system (CAHS) is a care delivery enterprise with diverse clinical and administrative agents acting spontaneously, interacting in nonlinear networks where agents and patients are information processors, and actively co-evolve with their environment with the purposed to produce safe and reliable patient-centered outcomes.\n\n\nCilliers, P.

In animal studies, when this deletion was introduced to developing birds, their wing buds were noted to take on limb-like structures. \n\nThe condition was first described by Dr. F. Liebenberg in 1973 while he followed multiple generations of a South African family, but it has since been noticed in other family lineages across the world.\n\nPeople who are affected by Liebenberg Syndrome suffer from three main symptoms:\n\nLiebenberg Syndrome follows an autosomal dominant mode of inheritance, whereby heterozygotes with this mutation express the disease phenotype.\n\nIt is caused by a heterozygous mutation to chromosome 5. It involves the inappropriate enhancement of the PITX1 gene due to genetic deletions and chromosome translocations.\n\nPITX1 is a homeobox gene which are genes that regulate proper body structure development. This PT1X gene encodes a transcription factor expressed in hind limbs. When expressed, it causes the formation of hindlimb structures.\n\nLiebenberg Syndrome is a result of one of two different genetic mutations. The first is a deletion upstream of the PITX1 gene on chromosome 5. This deletion includes the H2AFY gene, which is responsible for suppressing an upstream enhancer element known as hs1473. When H2AFY is removed, the enhancer is brought closer to PITX1 and inappropriately enhances it in forelimbs, causing them to adopt hindlimb morphology.\n\nThe second mutation that can cause the phenotype for Liebenberg syndrome is a translocation of chromosome 18 and chromosome 5. Translocation mutations are ones that switch parts of non-homologous chromosomes with each other. This move introduces two enhancers from chromosome 18 to move to a position directly upstream of PITX1 on chromosome 5. The enhancers increase transcription of the PITX1 gene and cause patients to develop the same phenotype described above.\n\nPeople with Liebenberg Syndrome have normal overall body structure. Their morphological differences are in both of their distal humeri, elbows, hands and wrists. The elbows are enlarged with abnormally large olecranons and radial heads. Patients have relatively fixed elbow positions and are therefore unable to pronate or supinate their forearms. Their wrists are also limited in their active movements and have very prominent ulnar sides of the joints. The fingers adopt toe-like structures. Brachydactyly and camptodactyly occur; fingers are short and abnormally bent. These changes in finger shape result in small club shaped appendages. Motion is reduced in all digital joints of the hand.\nSurgery is an option to correct some of the morphological changes made by Liebenberg Syndrome. Cases exist where surgery is performed to correct radial deviations and flexion deformities in the wrist. A surgery called a carpectomy has been performed on a patient whereby a surgeon removes the proximal row of the carpal bones. This procedure removes some of the carpal bones to create a more regular wrist function than is observed in people with this condition.\n"}

She is often the voice of reason in the office and a strong-willed, empathetic woman. In addition, she is an out lesbian. During many surgeries she criticizes the idea of what type of surgery they are doing, and to whom. At one point she is even questioned by detective Kit McGraw about what it is like for her to be a person with such morals in the business she is in.\n\nLiz bonds with one of McNamara/Troy's clients, a pre-op transsexual named Sofia Lopez. Sofia finds herself falling in love with her, but Liz decides not to further their relationship. During a stand-off involving violent criminal Escobar Gallardo, she is shot and sent to Bermuda to recover.\n\nLiz's biological clock starts to tick and she decides that she wants to have a baby before it is too late. After being rejected by potential donors due to her age, Liz is shocked when Christian offers his sperm to her. Despite their love/hate relationship, Liz eventually accepts his offer and becomes pregnant. However, Liz later aborts the baby after she is told that her child will have severe birth defects if born.\n\nDue to a financial crisis at McNamara/Troy, Liz resigns and takes up on Julia's offer to work with her at the female-run business Spa De La Mer, where she becomes their resident General Practitioner. At the end of the season, Liz finds herself a prime suspect in the Carver mystery as she had access to Christian's sperm and could have been the one who planted it at one of the crime scenes. She is interrogated by detective Kit McGraw, but is eventually released.\n\nNow working for McNamara/Troy again, Liz witnesses her new boss Michelle Landau in a compromising position with a mystery woman. After offering Michelle emotional support, Liz finds herself accused of sexual harassment and is almost fired. Her paths again cross with Michelle when she falls victim to an elaborate kidney theft organized by Michelle's old friend James, forcing her to recover in hospital for weeks. She later embarks on a relationship with young anesthesiologist Poppy, a fitness freak who encourages Liz to go under the knife. Liz eventually comes to her senses and ends their relationship. When Escobar Gallardo returns, Liz aims a gun at him and threatens to shoot, but is eventually talked out of it. After Gallardo is shot dead by his wife, Liz helps Sean and Christian dispose of the body.\n\nNow residing in Los Angeles, Liz questions Julia's lesbian relationship with Olivia Lord, believing that she is simply experimenting. She finds herself attracted to Olivia, and kisses her at the office, which angers Julia. When Christian is diagnosed with male breast cancer, Liz begins helping out around the apartment and taking care of him. Sleeping in Christian's bed, the two end up having sex and Liz has her first orgasm with a man. Liz begins to question her sexuality, but realizes that she is only in love with Christian. They start a brief affair, but after Christian undergoes a pectoral reconstruction and returns to sleeping with numerous partners, Liz is destroyed. She quits McNamara/Troy and informs Sean she is moving back to Miami. Christian's cancer returns and he is given six months to one year to live. He returns to Miami to ask Liz to marry him. After accepting she later declines before reconsidering and agreeing to marry Christian and spend the remaining months of his life as his wife. They then get married and Wilber asks Liz if he can call her mom, to which an overjoyed Liz agrees, unaware that Christian has just received news of his remission, Christian does not have cancer.\n\n\nLiz Cruz wants to be made partner in McNamara/Troy because of all the drama and crimes they have dragged her through over the years. However, because she is an anesthesiologist and not a plastic surgeon, she will not be made partner in their practice. Cruz has a date with a medical sales representative. Cruz brings her date to an orgasm but the date is a \"squirter\". This turns Cruz off, but Christian Troy talks her into staying with the woman.

{"id": "3990086", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=3990086", "title": "Michael Corvin", "text": "Michael Corvin\n\nMichael Corvin (in Hungarian: \"Corvin Mihály\") is a fictional character from the \"Underworld\" series. He also appears in the novelizations of these films. He is portrayed by Scott Speedman in the first two films, as well as Trent Garrett through motion capture and prosthetics in \"\" and voiced by Mark Oliver in \"\". He is the first Vampire/Lycan Hybrid from the mythos.\n\nMichael Corvin was created by Kevin Grevioux, Len Wiseman, and Danny McBride.\n\nAccording to the writer and directors commentary on the original theatrical release, Michael Corvin's role as a Vampire/Lycan Hybrid was the first character they created in the franchise when they were first writing out the script.\n\nAccording to director Len Wiseman, \"\"You'd think that the concept of vampires and werewolves mixing it up had been done more than a few times on film. But according to Wiseman, the mix hadn't really been done in decades. \"It's funny because a lot of the talk has been that it's a simple concept and why hasn't this been done before. It's true. When we decided let's do vampires and werewolves, we thought that concept's been done. Of course it's been done. We talked to our agent, we went on the Internet, we looked at everything, and outside of the 50s, it just hasn't been done. It was kind of shocking to us\"\".\n\nLittle is mentioned in the first installment about Michael's immediate family history, past and background, but his ancient family history, the legacy of his ancient ancestor, Alexander Corvinus, plays more of a crucial plot device in the franchise.\n\nDescribed in the novelizations as \"compassionate\" and a \"born healer\", Michael began studying medicine around the age of 20. He was an aspiring young 28-year-old doctor and trauma surgeon by the events of the first film.\n\nA few years before the events of the first film, Michael had been engaged to a woman, named Samantha, before she dies in a tragic car crash, leaving Michael devastated, as he did not possess the type of medical training to treat her for her injuries before help could arrive. In the first installment, he insists that he has no doubt in his mind that if he had known back then what he knew now that he could have saved her.\n\nAfter the tragedy, Michael would focus his efforts into specialising in trauma surgery and, after a few years after the crash, Michael obtained his medical degree, decided to take off and relocate to Budapest, Hungary, remembering the summer he had once spent there with his grandfather. According to the novelization, Michael had only been in Budapest for a matter of months before the events in the first film.\n\nAccording to Scott Speedman, the actor who portrays Michael in the franchise, about how his \"personal lack of gun knowledge worked in his favor\"; \"\"I get to carry a gun once in the movie and I didn't know what I was doing, and that was appropriate. I'm the \"girlfriend\". Every time I've got this shocked look on my face and she throws me to the ground. I'm screaming in terror. When I was watching it I was like, \"Wow, how weird.\" I'm fine with it. I'm glad I didn't have to know what I was doing with guns. That was easy for me\"\".\n\nMichael is a less complicated person than Selene. At the beginning of the events of the first film, Michael seems to be living a very stale and routine life. One of his fellow interns and fellow American at the hospital, Adam, when asked about Michael, says, \"He comes in. He does his job. And then he goes home: Other than that, I really don't know what to tell you. Interns pretty much work round the clock. We don't have much of a life\".\n\nAccording to the novelizations, in his spare time, Michael reads fiction, mainly mystery and thrillers (when she searches his apartment, Selene sees a fiction book amongst his medical texts and an EnglishHungarian dictionary).\n\nBoth of Michael's paternal grandparents originally came from Hungary, before they migrated to America in the 1940s, after the events of World War II. Michael himself was born sometime in 1975. As a kid, his grandfather had once taken him on a summer vacation to Hungary. According to the \"Underworld\" novelization, prior to moving to Hungary, he had lived in Long Island and still had friends there.\n\nIn the novelizations, he is described as a \"born healer\"; he took up medicine at around the age of 20. According to the novelizations, Michael once had a summer job as a lifeguard at Coney Island, as the training saved his and Selene's lives after they'd crashed into the Danube River, after Selene passed out from heavy blood loss. He also seems to have had some prior experience with mechanics, as he was able to get an old SUV working in the second installment.\n\nAt some point, a few years before the events of the first film, he was engaged to a woman called Samantha, who later died after a car accident.\n\nAfter the tragedy, Michael focused his efforts into specializing in a field the Trauma surgery and, after obtaining his Medical degree, a few years after the crash, decided to take off and relocate to Budapest, Hungary, after remembering the summer he had once spent there with his grandfather. After the accident, he \"\"didn't see a reason to stick around\", (alluding that his parents and grandparents are all dead), he decided to relocate to Hungary in an effort to start over, in his own words, \"to move on, to forget\"\".\n\nHe took up residency as an interning trauma surgeon at the Saint Istvan hospital in Budapest. According to the novelization, the hospital Michael's residency was at was the Karolyi Hospital, and he had only been in Budapest for a matter of months before the events in the first film.\n\nIn the events of the first film, Michael is repeatedly caught in the middle of a conflict between vampire Death Dealers and Lycans, as his blood might hold a rare genetic trait needed by the Lycans for a hybrid experiment. Despite the help of Selene, he is bitten by the Lycan leader Lucian. This sets him on the path to become a Lycan, and allows Lucian to gain a blood sample to confirm that Michael has a rare genetic trait for immortality. Selene and Michael work together to evade the Lycans, and understand Michael's significance to the conflict. He is eventually captured by the Lycans, who take him to Lucian.\n\nMichael is finally able to understand what motivates Lucian in the war, in part because Lucian's memories were passed on to Michael when he bit him. Selene and the death dealers interrupt the meeting, and in the commotion Michael is shot with a lethal amount of silver nitrate bullets by Selene's jealous suitor, Kraven. This would normally kill a Lycan, but Selene bites Michael, saving his life by transforming Michael into the first Hybrid. Viktor fights Michael, having been against the creation of a hybrid in addition to wanting to eliminate other descendants of Alexander Corvinus. Selene intervenes and kills Viktor.\n\nIn the second film, Selene and Michael are on the run from both Lycans and Vampires. Michael learns to master his power. The duo confronts the last Vampire Elder, Markus Corvinus, and narrowly manage to escape him, they encounter a warehouse, in which they have sexual intercourse. They encounter the vampire historian Andreas Tanis, and through him, Michael learns more of his familial connections with the Vampire and Lycan races. They investigate a cargo ship where Michael encounters his forefather, Alexander Corvinus. Michael is attacked by Markus who beats him and then impales Michael on a steel pole beneath a nearby dock. Michael originally appears to die, but eventually, his powers and Selene's blood heals him and he joins the fight against Markus and William. Michael manages to kill William by ripping his head apart and Selene kills Markus.\n\nIn \"\", Michael and Selene are captured and held captive for twelve years while Selene gives birth to their daughter Eve. Eventually Selene escapes and rescues Eve. During the rescue, she finds Michael trapped in a cryo-chamber and shoots the glass to weaken it. When Selene and Eve return, Michael has escaped and they are unable to find him.\n\nAfter escaping the Antigen facility, Michael is captured by the Lycan Marius. Michael's blood is drained to temporarily give Marius powers. Selene believes Michael to be dead after witnessing Marius' blood memories of the event.\n\nAs a human, Michael possessed a great deal of medical knowledge due to his training to become a doctor. After being transformed into a hybrid, Michael gained many powerful abilities. In Evolution, Selene tells Michael that there has never been a hybrid before and as such, his power could be \"limitless.\"\n\nActor Scott Speedman notes that his hardest task was enduring the werewolf make-up.\n\nKevin L. Nault describes Michael Corvin as \"Romeo\" in this story, adding \"Michael Corvin is a medical intern. He's not a gunfighter, nor a ninja, and most importantly, when attacked by werewolves and vampires, he does not turn into one.\"\n\n"}

{"id": "18403271", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=18403271", "title": "Nursing", "text": "Nursing\n\nNursing is a profession within the health care sector focused on the care of individuals, families, and communities so they may attain, maintain, or recover optimal health and quality of life. Nurses may be differentiated from other health care providers by their approach to patient care, training, and scope of practice. Nurses practice in many specialties with differing levels of prescription authority. Many nurses provide care within the ordering scope of physicians, and this traditional role has shaped the public image of nurses as care providers. However, nurse practitioners are permitted by most jurisdictions to practice independently in a variety of settings. In the postwar period, nurse education has undergone a process of diversification towards advanced and specialized credentials, and many of the traditional regulations and provider roles are changing.\n\nNurses develop a plan of care, working collaboratively with physicians, therapists, the patient, the patient's family and other team members, that focuses on treating illness to improve quality of life. In the United States and the United Kingdom, advanced practice nurses, such as clinical nurse specialists and nurse practitioners, diagnose health problems and prescribe medications and other therapies, depending on individual state regulations. Nurses may help coordinate the patient care performed by other members of a multidisciplinary health care team such as therapists, medical practitioners and dietitians. Nurses provide care both interdependently, for example, with physicians, and independently as nursing professionals.\nNursing historians face the challenge of determining whether care provided to the sick or injured in antiquity was nursing care. In the fifth century BC, for example, the Hippocratic Collection in places describes skilled care and observation of patients by male \"attendants\", who may have been early nurses. Around 600 BC in India, it is recorded in Sushruta Samhita, Book 3, Chapter V about the role of nurse as \"the different parts or members of the body as mentioned before including the skin, cannot be correctly described by one who is not well versed in anatomy. Hence, any one desirous of acquiring a thorough knowledge of anatomy should prepare a dead body and carefully, observe, by dissecting it, and examine its different parts.\"\n\nBefore the foundation of modern nursing, members of religious orders such as nuns and monks often provided nursing-like care. Examples exist in Christian, Islamic and Buddhist traditions amongst others. Phoebe, mentioned in Romans 16 has been described in many sources as \"the first visiting nurse\". These traditions were influential in the development of the ethos of modern nursing. The religious roots of modern nursing remain in evidence today in many countries. One example in the United Kingdom is the use of the historical title \"sister\" to refer to a senior nurse in the past.\n\nDuring the Reformation of the 16th century, Protestant reformers shut down the monasteries and convents, allowing a few hundred municipal hospices to remain in operation in northern Europe. Those nuns who had been serving as nurses were given pensions or told to get married and stay home. Nursing care went to the inexperienced as traditional caretakers, rooted in the Roman Catholic Church, were removed from their positions. The nursing profession suffered a major setback for approximately 200 years.\n\nFlorence Nightingale laid the foundations of professional nursing after the Crimean War. Her \"Notes on Nursing\" (1859) became popular. The Nightingale model of professional education, having set up the first school of nursing that is connected to a continuously operating hospital and medical school, spread widely in Europe and North America after 1870. Nightingale was also a pioneer of the graphical presentation of statistical data.\n\nOther important nurses in the development of the profession include:\n\nCatholic orders such as Little Sisters of the Poor, Sisters of Mercy, Sisters of St. Mary, St. Francis Health Services, Inc. and Sisters of Charity built hospitals and provided nursing services during this period. In turn, the modern deaconess movement began in Germany in 1836. Within a half century, there were over 5,000 deaconesses in Europe.\n\nFormal use of nurses in the modern military began in the latter half of the nineteenth century. Nurses saw active duty in the First Boer War, the Egyptian Campaign (1882) and the Sudan Campaign (1883).\n\nHospital-based training came to the fore in the early 1900s, with an emphasis on practical experience. The Nightingale-style school began to disappear. Hospitals and physicians saw women in nursing as a source of free or inexpensive labor. Exploitation of nurses was not uncommon by employers, physicians and educational providers.\n\nMany nurses saw active duty in World War I, but the profession was transformed during the second World War. British nurses of the Army Nursing Service were part of every overseas campaign. More nurses volunteered for service in the US Army and Navy than any other occupation. The Nazis had their own Brown Nurses, 40,000 strong. Two dozen German Red Cross nurses were awarded the Iron Cross for heroism under fire.\n\nThe modern era saw the development of undergraduate and post-graduate nursing degrees. Advancement of nursing research and a desire for association and organization led to the formation of a wide variety of professional organizations and academic journals. Growing recognition of nursing as a distinct academic discipline was accompanied by an awareness of the need to define the theoretical basis for practice.\n\nIn the 19th and early 20th century, nursing was considered a women's profession, just as doctoring was a men's profession. With increasing expectations of workplace equality during the late 20th century, nursing became an officially gender-neutral profession, though in practice the percentage of male nurses remains well below that of female physicians in the early 21st century.\n\nAlthough nursing practice varies both through its various specialties and countries, these nursing organizations offer the following definitions:\n\nThe authority for the practice of nursing is based upon a social contract that delineates professional rights and responsibilities as well as mechanisms for public accountability. In almost all countries, nursing practice is defined and governed by law, and entrance to the profession is regulated at the national or state level.\n\nThe aim of the nursing community worldwide is for its professionals to ensure quality care for all, while maintaining their credentials, code of ethics, standards, and competencies, and continuing their education. There are a number of educational paths to becoming a professional nurse, which vary greatly worldwide; all involve extensive study of nursing theory and practice as well as training in clinical skills.\n\nNurses care for individuals of all ages and cultural backgrounds who are healthy and ill in a holistic manner based on the individual's physical, emotional, psychological, intellectual, social, and spiritual needs. The profession combines physical science, social science, nursing theory, and technology in caring for those individuals.\n\nTo work in the nursing profession, all nurses hold one or more credentials depending on their scope of practice and education. In the United States, a licensed practical nurse (LPN) (also referred to as a licensed vocational nurse, registered practical nurse) works independently or with a registered nurse (RN). The most significant differentiation between an LPN and RN is found in the requirements for entry to practice, which determines entitlement for their scope of practice. For example, Canada requires a bachelor's degree for the RN and a two-year diploma for the LPN. A registered nurse provides scientific, psychological, and technological knowledge in the care of patients and families in many health care settings. Registered nurses may earn additional credentials or degrees.\n\nIn the United States, multiple educational paths will qualify a candidate to sit for the licensure examination as a registered nurse. The Associate Degree in Nursing (ADN) is awarded to the nurse who has completed a two-year undergraduate academic degree awarded by community colleges, junior colleges, technical colleges, and bachelor's degree-granting colleges and universities upon completion of a course of study usually lasting two years. It is also referred to as Associate in Nursing (AN), Associate of Applied Science in Nursing (AAS), or Associate of Science in Nursing (ASN). The Bachelor of Science in Nursing (BScN) is awarded to the nurse who has earned an American four-year academic degree in the science and principles of nursing, granted by a tertiary education university or similarly accredited school. After completing either the LPN or either RN education programs in the United States, graduates are eligible to sit for a licensing examination to become a nurse, the passing of which is required for the nursing license. The National Licensure Examination (NCLEX) test is a standardized exam (including multiple choice, select all that apply, fill in the blank and \"hot spot\" questions) that nurses take to become licensed. It costs two-hundred dollars to take the NCLEX. It examines a nurses ability to properly care for a client. Study books and practice tests are available for purchase.\n\nNurses may follow their personal and professional interests by working with any group of people, in any setting, at any time. Some nurses follow the traditional role of working in a hospital setting. Other options include: pediatrics, neonatal, maternity, OBGYN, geriatrics, ambulatory, and nurse anesthetists. There are many other options nurses can explore depending on the type of degree and education acquired. RNs may also pursue different roles as advanced practice registered nurses.\n\nNurses are not truly doctor's assistants. This is possible in certain situations, but nurses more often are independently caring for their patients or assisting other nurses. Registered Nurses treat patients, record their medical history, provide emotional support, and provide follow-up care. Nurses also help doctors perform diagnostic tests. Nurses are almost always working on their own or with other nurses. Nurses will assist doctors in the emergency room or in trauma care when help is needed.\n\nDespite equal opportunity legislation, nursing has continued to be a female-dominated profession. For instance, the male-to-female ratio of nurses is approximately 1:19 in Canada and the United States. This ratio is represented around the world. Notable exceptions include Francophone Africa, which includes the countries of Benin, Burkina Faso, Cameroon, Chad, Congo, Côte d'Ivoire, the Democratic Republic of Congo, Djibouti, Guinea, Gabon, Mali, Mauritania, Niger, Rwanda, Senegal, and Togo, which all have more male than female nurses. In Europe, in countries such as Spain, Portugal, Czech Republic and Italy, over 20% of nurses are male. In the United Kingdom, 11% of nurses and midwives registered with the NMC are male. The number of male-registered nurses in the United States between 1980 and 2000s doubled.\n\nThe nursing industry is dominated by females, but there are male nurses in the profession as well. A study in 2011 shows that 91% of all nurses in the United States were female, and 9% were male. Although females are more common, male nurses receive the same pay. The highest percentage of male nurses are found as nurse anesthetists, rating at 41%.\n\nNursing practice is the actual provision of nursing care. In providing care, nurses implement the nursing care plan using the nursing process. This is based around a specific nursing theory which is selected based on the care setting and population served. In providing nursing care, the nurse uses both nursing theory and best practice derived from nursing research.\n\nIn general terms, the nursing process is the method used to assess and diagnose needs, plan outcomes and interventions, implement interventions, and evaluate the outcomes of the care provided. Like other disciplines, the profession has developed different theories derived from sometimes diverse philosophical beliefs and paradigms or worldviews to help nurses direct their activities to accomplish specific goals.\n\nAssisting in activities of daily living (ADL) are skills required in nursing as well as other professions such as nursing assistants. This includes assisting in patient mobility, such as moving an activity intolerant patient within bed. For hygiene, this often involves bed baths and assisting with urinary and bowel elimination.\n\nNurses do not have the authority to prescribe medications, with some exceptions. All medications administered by nurses must be from a medication prescription from a licensed practitioner. Nurses are legally responsible for the drugs they administer and there may be legal implications when there is an error in a prescription and the nurse could be expected to have noted and reported error. In the United States, nurses have the right to refuse any medication administration that they deem to be harmful to the patient.\nIn the United Kingdom there are some nurses who have taken additional specialist training that allows them to prescribe certain medications.\n\nThe patient's family is often involved in the education. Effective patient education leads to fewer complications and hospital visits.\n\nNursing is the most diverse of all . Nurses practice in a wide range of settings but generally nursing is divided depending on the needs of the person being nursed.\n\nThe major populations are:\n\nThere are also specialist areas such as cardiac nursing, orthopedic nursing, palliative care, perioperative nursing, obstetrical nursing, oncology nursing, nursing informatics, telenursing and emergency nursing.\n\nNurses practice in a wide range of settings, from hospitals to visiting people in their homes and caring for them in schools to research in pharmaceutical companies. Nurses work in occupational health settings (also called industrial health settings), free-standing clinics and physician offices, nurse-led clinics, long-term care facilities and camps. They also work on cruise ships and in military service. Nurses act as advisers and consultants to the health care and insurance industries. Many nurses also work in the health advocacy and patient advocacy fields at companies such as Health Advocate, Inc. helping in a variety of clinical and administrative issues. Some are attorneys and others work with attorneys as legal nurse consultants, reviewing patient records to assure that adequate care was provided and testifying in court. Nurses can work on a temporary basis, which involves doing shifts without a contract in a variety of settings, sometimes known as \"per diem nursing\", \"agency nursing\" or \"travel nursing\". Nurses work as researchers in laboratories, universities, and research institutions. Nurses have also been delving into the world of informatics, acting as consultants to the creation of computerized charting programs and other software.\n\nInternationally, there is a serious shortage of nurses. One reason for this shortage is due to the work environment in which nurses practice. In a recent review of the empirical human factors and ergonomic literature specific to nursing performance, nurses were found to work in generally poor environmental conditions. Some countries and states have passed legislation regarding acceptable nurse-to-patient ratios.\n\nThe fast-paced and unpredictable nature of health care places nurses at risk for injuries and illnesses, including high occupational stress. Nursing is a particularly stressful profession, and nurses consistently identify stress as a major work-related concern and have among the highest levels of occupational stress when compared to other professions. This stress is caused by the environment, psychosocial stressors, and the demands of nursing, including new technology that must be mastered, the emotional labor involved in nursing, physical labor, shift work, and high workload. This stress puts nurses at risk for short-term and long-term health problems, including sleep disorders, depression, mortality, psychiatric disorders, stress-related illnesses, and illness in general. Nurses are at risk of developing compassion fatigue and moral distress, which can worsen mental health. They also have very high rates of occupational burnout (40%) and emotional exhaustion (43.2%). Burnout and exhaustion increase the risk for illness, medical error, and suboptimal care provision.\n\nIn the United States, the Occupational Health Safety Network (OHSN) is an electronic surveillance system developed by the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) to address health and safety risks among health care personnel, including nurses. It focuses on three high risk and preventable events:\nHospitals and other healthcare facilities can upload the occupational injury data they already collect for analysis and benchmarking with other de-identified facilities, in order to identify and implement timely and targeted interventions.\n\nNurses are also at risk for violence and abuse in the workplace. Violence is typically perpetrated by non-staff (e.g. patients or family), whereas abuse is typically perpetrated by other hospital personnel. 57% of American nurses reported in 2011 that they had been threatened at work; 17% were physically assaulted.\n\nThere are a number of interventions that can mitigate the occupational hazards of nursing. They can be individual-focused or organization-focused. Individual-focused interventions include stress management programs, which can be customized to individuals. Stress management programs can reduce anxiety, sleep disorders, and other symptoms of stress. Organizational interventions focus on reducing stressful aspects of the work environment by defining stressful characteristics and developing solutions to them. Using organizational and individual interventions together is most effective at reducing stress on nurses.\n\nCatholic religious institutes were influential in the development of Australian nursing, founding many of Australia's hospitals – the Irish Sisters of Charity were first to arrive in 1838 and established St Vincent's Hospital, Sydney in 1857 as a free hospital for the poor. They and other orders like the Sisters of Mercy, and in aged care the Sisters of the Little Company of Mary and Little Sisters of the Poor founded hospitals, hospices, research institutes and aged care facilities around Australia.\n\nA census in the 1800s found several hundred nurses working in Western Australia during the colonial period of history, this included Aboriginal female servants who cared for the infirm.\n\nThe state nursing licensing bodies amalgamated in Australia in 2011 under the federal body AHPRA (Australian Health Practitioner Registration Authority). Several divisions of nursing license is available and recognized around the country.\n\nAustralia enjoys the luxury of a national curriculum for vocational nurses, trained at TAFE colleges or private RTO. Enrolled and registered nurses are identified by the department of immigration as an occupational area of need, although registered nurses are always in shorter supply, and this increases in proportion with specialization.\n\nIn 1986 there were a number of rolling industrial actions around the country, culminating when five thousand Victorian nurses went on strike for eighteen days. The hospitals were able to function by hiring casual staff from each other's striking members, but the increased cost forced a decision in the nurses' favor \n\nIn the European Union, the profession of nurse is regulated. A profession is said to be regulated when access and exercise is subject to the possession of a specific professional qualification. The regulated professions database contains a list of regulated professions for nurse in the EU member states, EEA countries and Switzerland. This list is covered by the Directive 2005/36/EC.\n\nNursing educational program in Iran is similar to the nursing educational program in other countries from some aspects. Holding secondary school diploma and passing the entrance exam is necessary for the admission in this course. Entrance exam to governmental universities and Azad University is held on separate basis. Duration of associate degree course of operating room and anesthesia is 2 years, bachelor's degree in nursing is 4 years and master's degree in nursing is 2- 2.5 years and PhD degree in nursing is 4–5 years.\n\nIn the beginning, nursing educational program was the part of medical educational program. On the basis of this structure, the nurse follows the instruction of physician without any question. Nowadays, nursing educational program in Iran has been progressed and after the year 1992 considering the community base care, the nursing educational program also has changed. At present nursing education is held in 43 governmental nursing colleges and 63 nursing colleges of Azad University. Governmental universities' students do not have to pay tuition fee, but in Azad University, which is a private university, the students must pay necessary expenses. The PhD degree program is held only in governmental universities under the supervision of Ministry of Health and Ministry of Sciences.\n\nIn bachelor's degree program, nursing students start the clinical work from 2nd term and pass till the completion of 6th term simultaneously with theoretical subjects. 7th and 8th terms are allocated for training program. At present nursing educational program in throughout Iran is the same and is compiled under the supervision of Supreme Council of Ministry of Health, Treatment and Medical Education. Nursing students take the theoretical subjects, training and internship courses in various sections of educational hospitals and hospitals that affiliated to universities. Students' learning, in clinical sections is performed under the direct supervision and guidance of nursing instructors, but in the final year, activities of students mainly performs under the supervision of nursing personnel and alternate supervision of nursing instructors.\n\nStudents, during the years of study have opportunity to create relation with patients in the various sections especially intensive care units and to achieve experiences. Students' progress in clinical environments is from simple issues toward harder issues. At present practical nursing degree and associate degree Nursing Program has been canceled and Iranian nurses must hold bachelor's degree to work in Iran from accredited universities confirmed by the Ministry of Health.\n\nNurse is a person who is holding four years university degree and executes works relating to nursing profession including taking care of patients, perform health and medical services, educational, research and managerial affairs. At present annually 6000 persons are graduated in the bachelor's degree program in nursing.\nA person who is holding secondary school diploma in nursing and have completed 2 years program in nursing and cooperate in activities of nurses in medical sections under the supervision of nurses.\nA person who is holding secondary school diploma and passing short term program for the execution of initial cares of patients under the supervision of nurses.\nThese persons after obtaining secondary school diploma and passing university's entrance exam and completing 2 years program are in charge of performing professional duties in operation room for preparing patients for surgery and necessary cooperation with surgeons at the time of surgery. These persons by passing the exam are eligible to continue uncontinuous bachelor's degree course in nursing.\nThese persons after obtaining secondary school diploma and passing university's entrance exam and completing 2 years program in Anesthesia, are in charge of performing profession duties in the operating room in the field of anesthesia including preparing the patients for anesthesia and necessary cooperation with anesthesiologists at the time of operation. These persons by passing exam are eligible to continue uncontinuous bachelor's degree course in nursing.\nThese persons after obtaining secondary school diploma and passing entrance exam of university and obtaining technician diploma are in change of performing affairs including rendering first aid services to the patients and emergency victims resulting from accidents with motor vehicles, explosion, debris, falling from height, fractures, burns, poisonings, cuts, drowning, industrial accidents (cutting of limbs), patients with heart diseases and baby delivering.\nNurses after obtaining bachelor's degree and passing the entrance exam are eligible to continue their study in geriatric nursing, pediatric nursing, medical surgical nursing, community health nursing, psychiatric nursing and nursing education. These persons after graduation mainly become in charge of nurses' education or management of medical sections. Duration of this program is 2.5 years. At present annually 150 persons are graduated in master's degree program in nursing.\nNurses by holding master's degree after passing entrance exam, are eligible to continue their study in PhD in the field of Nursing. Duration of this program is 4 years and the graduates mainly will work in educational and research sections. At present annually 20 persons are graduated in this program.\n\nAccording to the censes at present approximately 120,000 nurses are working in Iran in various sections. Most of them are working in hospitals and health centers belong to Ministry of Health, Treatment & Medical Education. Also, nurses are working in the hospitals affiliated to social security organization, armed forces, private sector and charity sector.\n\nWithin the last years of independence, nurses' activities are established in offices of consultancy and rendering nursing services at home. Nurses by establishment these centers can render consultant and care services to the client.\n\nAt present to work as a nurse only holding accredited academic degree is sufficient, but there are programs for nurses to take RN examination after graduation.\n\nAlso, upon the approval and execution of continuous educational act, the Iranian nurses should obtain score of 15 every year in various educational courses held by the Ministry of Health of Universities, Scientific Associations and Nursing organization.\n\nTo practice lawfully as a registered nurse in the United Kingdom, the practitioner must hold a current and valid registration with the Nursing and Midwifery Council. The title \"Registered Nurse\" can only be granted to those holding such registration. This protected title is laid down in the Nurses, Midwives and Health Visitors Act, 1997. From April 2016, nurses in the United Kingdom are expected to revalidate every three years which involves providing evidence of further development and active practice.\n\nFirst-level nurses make up the bulk of the registered nurses in the UK. They were previously known by titles such as registered general nurse (RGN), registered sick children's nurse (RSCN), registered mental nurse (RMN) and registered nurse (for the) mentally handicapped (RNMH). The titles used now are similar, including registered nurse adult (RNA), registered nurse child (RNC), registered nurse mental health (RNMH) and registered nurse learning disabilities (RNLD). Second-level nurse training is no longer provided; however, they are still legally able to practice in the United Kingdom as a registered nurse. Many have now either retired or undertaken conversion courses to become first-level nurses. They are entitled to refer to themselves as registered nurses as their registration is on the Nursing & Midwifery Council register of nurses, although most refer to themselves as ENs or SENs.\n\n\nMany nurses who have worked in clinical settings for a long time choose to leave clinical nursing and join the ranks of the NHS management. This used to be seen as a natural career progression for those who had reached ward management positions, however with the advent of specialist nursing roles (see above), this has become a less attractive option.\n\nNonetheless, many nurses fill positions in the senior management structure of NHS organizations, some even as board members. Others choose to stay a little closer to their clinical roots by becoming clinical nurse managers or \"modern matrons\".\n\nTo become a registered nurse, one must complete a program recognised by the Nursing and Midwifery Council (NMC). Currently, this involves completing a degree, available from a range of , in the chosen branch specialty (see below), leading to both an academic award and professional registration as a 1st level registered nurse. Such a course is a 50/50 split of learning in university (i.e. through lectures, assignments and examinations) and in practice (i.e. supervised patient care within a hospital or community setting).\n\nThese courses are three (occasionally four) years' long. The first year is known as the common foundation program (CFP), and teaches the basic knowledge and skills required of all nurses. Skills included in the CFP may include communication, taking observations, administering medication and providing personal care to patients. The remainder of the program consists of training specific to the student's chosen branch of nursing. These are:\n\n\nAs of 2013, the Nursing and Midwifery Council will require all new nurses qualifying in the UK to hold a degree qualification.<ref name=\"http://www.nmc-uk.org/Get-involved/Consultations/Past-consultations/By-year/Pre-registration-nursing-education-Phase-2/Changes-to-pre-registration-nursing-programmes-FAQs-/\"></ref> However, those nurses who hold a diploma, or even a certificate in nursing are still able to legally practice in the UK, although they are able to undertake university modules to obtain enough credits to top up to a degree.\n\nMidwifery training is similar in length and structure, but is sufficiently different that it is not considered a branch of nursing. There are shortened (18 month) programs to allow nurses already qualified in the adult branch to hold dual registration as a nurse and a midwife. Shortened courses lasting 2 years also exist for graduates of other disciplines to train as nurses. This is achieved by more intense study and a shortening of the common foundation program.\n\nBefore Project 2000, nurse education was the responsibility of hospitals and was not based in universities; hence many nurses who qualified prior to these reforms do not hold an academic award.\n\nAfter the point of initial registration, there is an expectation that all qualified nurses will continue to update their skills and knowledge. The Nursing and Midwifery Council insists on a minimum of 35 hours of education every three years, as part of its post registration education and practice (PREP) requirements.<ref name=\"http://www.nmc-uk.org/Nurses-and-midwives/Advice-by-topic/A/Advice/Post-Registration-Education-and-Practice-Prep-requirements-for-midwives/\"></ref>\n\nThere are also opportunities for many nurses to gain additional clinical skills after qualification. Cannulation, venipuncture, intravenous drug therapy and male catheterization are the most common, although there are many others (such as advanced life support), which some nurses undertake.\n\nMany nurses who qualified with a diploma choose to upgrade their qualification to a degree by studying part-time. Many nurses prefer this option to gaining a degree initially, as there is often an opportunity to study in a specialist field as a part of this upgrading. Financially, in England, it was also much more lucrative, as diploma students get the full bursary during their initial training, and employers often pay for the degree course as well as the nurse's salary.\n\nTo become specialist nurses (such as nurse consultants, nurse practitioners etc.) or nurse educators, some nurses undertake further training above bachelor's degree level. Master's degrees exist in various healthcare related topics, and some nurses choose to study for PhDs or other higher academic awards. District nurses and health visitors are also considered specialist nurses, and to become such they must undertake specialist training. This is a one-year full-time degree.\n\nAll newly qualifying district nurses and health visitors are trained to prescribe from the Nurse Prescribers' Formulary, a list of medications and dressings typically useful to those carrying out these roles. Many of these (and other) nurses will also undertake training in independent and supplementary prescribing, which allows them (as of 1 May 2006) to prescribe almost any drug in the British National Formulary. This has been the cause of a great deal of debate in both medical and nursing circles.\n\nCanadian nursing dates back to 1639 in Quebec with the Augustine nuns. These nuns were trying to open a mission that cared for the spiritual and physical needs of patients. The establishment of this mission created the first nursing apprenticeship training in North America. In the nineteenth century, some Catholic orders of nursing were trying to spread their message across Canada. Most nurses were female and only had an occasional consultation with a physician. Towards the end of the nineteenth century, hospital care and medical services had been improved and expanded. Much of this was due to Nightingale's influence. In 1874 the first formal nursing training program was started at the General and Marine Hospital in St. Catharines in Ontario.\n\nAll Canadian nurses and prospective nurses are heavily encouraged by the Canadian Nurses Association to continue their education to receive a baccalaureate degree. They believe that this is the best degree to work towards because it results in better patient outcomes. In addition to helping patients, nurses that have a baccalaureate degree will be less likely to make small errors because they have a higher level of education. A baccalaureate degree also gives a nurse a more critical opinion, which gives him or her more of an edge in the field. This ultimately saves the hospital money because they deal with less problematic incidents. All Canadian provinces and territories except for the Yukon and Quebec require that all nurses must have a baccalaureate degree. The basic length of time that it takes to obtain a baccalaureate degree is four years. However, Canada does have a condensed program that is two years long.\n\nNursing specialty certification is available through the Canadian Nurses Association in nineteen practice areas. Some of those specialties are cardiovascular nursing, community health nursing, critical care nursing, emergency nursing, gerontological nursing, medical-surgical nursing, neuroscience nursing, oncology nursing, orthopedic nursing, psychiatric/mental health nursing, and rehabilitation nursing. Certification requires practice experience and passing a test that is based on competencies for that specialty.\n\nCanadian nurses hold a lot of responsibility in the medical field and are considered vital. According to the Canadian Nurses Association, \"They expect RNs to develop and implement multi-faceted plans for managing chronic disease, treating complex health conditions and assisting them in the transition from the hospital to the community. Canadians also look to RNs for health education and for strategies to improve their health. RNs assess the appropriateness of new research and technology for patients and adjust care plans accordingly\".\n\nNursing was not an established part of Japan's healthcare system until 1899 with the Midwives Ordinance. From there the Registered Nurse Ordinance came into play in 1915. This established a legal substantiation to registered nurses all over Japan. A new law geared towards nurses was created during World War II: the \"Public Health Nurse, Midwife and Nurse Law\", established in 1948. It established educational requirements, standards and licensure. There has been a continued effort to improve nursing in Japan. In 1992 the Nursing Human Resource Law was passed. This law created the development of new university programs for nurses. Those programs were designed to raise the education level of the nurses so that they could be better suited for taking care of the public.\n\nJapan only recognizes four types of nursing and they are Public Health Nursing, Midwifery, Registered Nursing and Assistant Nursing.\n\nThis type of nursing is designed to help the public and is also driven by the public's needs. The goals of public health nurses are to monitor the spread of disease, keep vigilant watch for environmental hazards, educate the community on how to care for and treat themselves, and train for community disasters.\n\nNurses that are involved with midwifery are independent of any organization. A midwife takes care of a pregnant woman during labour and postpartum. They assist with things like breastfeeding and caring for the child.\n\nIndividuals who are assistant nurses follow orders from a registered nurse. They report back to the licensed nurse about a patient's condition. Assistant nurses are always supervised by a licensed registered nurse.\n\nIn 1952 Japan established the first nursing university in the country. An Associate Degree was the only level of certification for years. Soon people began to want nursing degrees at a higher level of education. Soon the Bachelor's degree in Nursing (BSN) was established. Currently Japan offers doctorate level degrees of nursing in a good number of its universities.\n\nThere are three ways that an individual could become a registered nurse in Japan. After obtaining a high school degree the person could go to a nursing university for four years and earn a bachelor's degree, go to a junior nursing college for three years or go to a nursing school for three years. Regardless of where the individual attends school they must take the national exam. Those who attended a nursing university have a bit of an advantage over those who went to a nursing school. They can take the national exam to be a registered nurse, public health nurse or midwife. In the cases of become a midwife or a public health nurse, the student must take a one-year course in their desired field after attending a nursing university and passing the national exam to become a registered nurse. The nursing universities are the best route for someone who wants to become a nurse in Japan. They offer a wider range of general education classes and they also allow for a more rigid teaching style of nursing. These nursing universities train their students to be able to make critical and educated decisions when they are out in the field. Physicians are the ones who are teaching the potential nurses because there are not enough available nurses to teach students. This increases the dominance that physicians have over nurses.\n\nStudents that attend a nursing college or just a nursing school receive the same degree that one would who graduated from a nursing university, but they do not have the same educational background. The classes offered at nursing colleges and nursing schools are focused on more practical aspects of nursing. These institutions do not offer many general education classes, so students who attend these schools will solely be focusing on their nursing educations while they are in school. Students who attend a nursing college or school do have the opportunity to become a midwife or a public health nurse. They have to go through a training institute for their desired field after graduating from the nursing school or college. Japanese nurses never have to renew their licenses. Once they have passed their exam, they have their license for life.\n\nLike the United States, Japan is in need of more nurses. The driving force behind this need this is the fact that country is aging and needs more medical care for its people. The country needs a rapid increase of nurses however things do not seem to be turning around. Some of the reasons that there is a shortage are poor working conditions, an increase in the number of hospital beds, the low social status of nurses, and the cultural idea that married women quit their jobs for family responsibilities. On average, Japanese nurses make around 280,000 yen a month, and it is one of the higher paying jobs. However, physicians make twice as much as nurses. Similar to other cultures, the Japanese people view nurses as subservient to physicians. They are considered lesser and oftentimes negative connotations are associated with nurses. According to the American Nurses Association article on Japan, \"nursing work has been described using negative terminology such as 'hard, dirty, dangerous, low salary, few holidays, minimal chance of marriage and family, and poor image'\".\n\nSome nurses in Japan are trying to be advocates. They are promoting better nursing education as well as promoting the care of the elderly. There are some organizations that unite Japanese nurses like the Japanese Nursing Association (JNA). The JNA is not to be confused with a union, it is simply a professional organization for the nurses. Members of the JNA lobby politicians and produces publications about nursing. According to the American Nurses Association's article on Japan the JNA, \"works toward the improvement in nursing practice through many activities including the development of a policy research group to influence policy development, a code of ethics for nurses, and standards of nursing practice\". The JNA also provides certification for specialists in mental health, oncology and community health. The JNA is not the only nursing organization in Japan. There are other subgroups that are typically categorized by the nurses' specialty, like emergency nursing or disaster nursing. One of the older unions that relates to nursing is the Japanese Federation of Medical Workers Union, which was created in 1957. It is a union that includes physicians as well as nurses. This organization was involved with the Nursing Human Resource Law.\n\n\nIn the US, scope of practice is determined by the state or territory in which a nurse is licensed. Each state has its own laws, rules, and regulations governing nursing care. Usually the making of such rules and regulations is delegated to a state board of nursing, which performs day-to-day administration of these rules, licenses nurses and nursing assistants, and makes decisions on nursing issues. In some states, the terms \"nurse\" or \"nursing\" may only be used in conjunction with the practice of a registered nurse (RN) or licensed practical or vocational nurse (LPN/LVN).\n\nIn the hospital setting, registered nurses often delegate tasks to LPNs and unlicensed assistive personnel.\n\nRNs are not limited to employment as bedside nurses. They are employed by physicians, attorneys, insurance companies, governmental agencies, community/public health agencies, private industry, school districts, ambulatory surgery centers, among others. Some registered nurses are independent consultants who work for themselves, while others work for large manufacturers or chemical companies. Research nurses conduct or assist in the conduct of research or evaluation (outcome and process) in many areas such as biology, psychology, human development, and health care systems.\n\nMany employers offer flexible work schedules, child care, educational benefits, and bonuses. About 21 percent of registered nurses are union members or covered by union contract.\n\nNursing is the nation's largest health care profession, with more than 3.1 million registered nurses nationwide. Of all licensed RNs, 2.6 million or 84.8% are employed in nursing. Nurses comprise the largest single component of hospital staff, are the primary providers of hospital patient care, and deliver most of the nation's long-term care. The primary pathway to professional nursing, as compared to technical-level practice, is the four-year Bachelor of Science in Nursing (BSN) degree. Registered nurses are prepared either through a BSN program; a three-year associate degree in nursing; or a three-year hospital training program, receiving a hospital diploma. All take the same state licensing exam. (The number of diploma programs has declined steadily—to less than 10 percent of all basic RN education programs—as nursing education has shifted from hospital-operated instruction into the college and university system.)\n\nThe oldest method of nursing education is the hospital-based diploma program, which lasts approximately three years. Students take between 30 and 60 credit hours in anatomy, physiology, microbiology, nutrition, chemistry, and other subjects at a college or university, then move on to intensive nursing classes. Until 1996, most RNs in the US were initially educated in nursing by diploma programs. According to the Health Services Resources Administration's 2000 Survey of Nurses only six percent of nurses who graduated from nursing programs in the United States received their education at a Diploma School of Nursing.<ref name=\"ftp://ftp.hrsa.gov/bhpr/rnsurvey2000/rnsurvey00-1.pdf.\">ftp://ftp.hrsa.gov/bhpr/rnsurvey2000/rnsurvey00-1.pdf.</ref>\n\nThe most common initial nursing education is a two-year Associate Degree in Nursing (Associate of Applied Science in Nursing, Associate of Science in Nursing, Associate Degree in Nursing), a two-year college degree referred to as an ADN. Some four-year colleges and universities also offer the ADN. Associate degree nursing programs have prerequisite and corequisite courses (which may include English, Math and Human Anatomy and Physiology) and ultimately stretch out the degree-acquiring process to about three years or greater.\n\nThe third method is to obtain a Bachelor of Science in Nursing (BSN), a four-year degree that also prepares nurses for graduate-level education. For the first two years in a BSN program, students usually obtain general education requirements and spend the remaining time in nursing courses. In some new programs the first two years can be substituted for an active LPN license along with the required general studies. Advocates for the ADN and diploma programs state that such programs have an on the job training approach to educating students, while the BSN is an academic degree that emphasizes research and nursing theory. Some states require a specific amount of clinical experience that is the same for both BSN and ADN students. A BSN degree qualifies its holder for administrative, research, consulting and teaching positions that would not usually be available to those with an ADN, but is not necessary for most patient care functions. Nursing schools may be accredited by either the Accreditation Commission for Education in Nursing (ACEN) or the Commission on Collegiate Nursing Education (CCNE).\n\nAdvanced education in nursing is done at the master's and doctoral levels. It prepares the graduate for specialization as an advanced practice registered nurse (APRN) or for advanced roles in leadership, management, or education. The clinical nurse leader (CNL) is an advanced generalist who focuses on the improvement of quality and safety outcomes for patients or patient populations from an administrative and staff management focus. Doctoral programs in nursing prepare the student for work in nursing education, health care administration, clinical research, public policy, or advanced clinical practice. Most programs confer the PhD in nursing or Doctor of Nursing Practice (DNP).\n\nAdvanced practice registered nurse (APRN)\n\nAreas of advanced nursing practice include that of a nurse practitioner (NP), a certified nurse midwife (CNM), a certified registered nurse anesthetist (CRNA), or a clinical nurse specialist (CNS). Nurse practitioners and CNSs work assessing, diagnosing and treating patients in fields as diverse as family practice, women's health care, emergency nursing, acute/critical care, psychiatry, geriatrics, or pediatrics, additionally, a CNS usually works for a facility to improve patient care, do research, or as a staff educator.\n\nCompletion of any one of these three educational routes allows a graduate nurse to take the NCLEX-RN, the test for licensure as a registered nurse, and is accepted by every state as an adequate indicator of minimum competency for a new graduate. However, controversy exists over the appropriate entry-level preparation of RNs. Some professional organizations believe the BSN should be the sole method of RN preparation and ADN graduates should be licensed as \"technical nurses\" to work under the supervision of BSN graduates. Others feel the on-the-job experiences of diploma and ADN graduates makes up for any deficiency in theoretical preparation.\n\nRNs are the largest group of health care workers in the United States, with about 2.7 million employed in 2011. It has been reported that the number of new graduates and foreign-trained nurses is insufficient to meet the demand for registered nurses; this is often referred to as the nursing shortage and is expected to increase for the foreseeable future. There are data to support the idea that the nursing shortage is a voluntary shortage. In other words, nurses are leaving nursing of their own volition. In 2006 it was estimated that approximately 1.8 million nurses chose not to work as a nurse. The Bureau of Labor Statistics reported that 296,900 healthcare jobs were created in 2011. RNs make up the majority of the healthcare work force, therefore these positions will be filled primarily by nurses. The BLS also states that by 2020, there will be 1.2 million nursing job openings due to an increase in the workforce, and replacements. (Rosseter, 2012).\n\nThe International Council Of Nursing (ICN), the largest international health professional organization in the world, recognizes the shortage of nurses as a growing crisis in the world. This shortage impacts the healthcare of everyone worldwide. One of the many reasons is that nurses who pursue to become nurses do so very late in their lives. This leads to a non-lengthy employment time. A national survey prepared by the Federation of Nurses and Health Professionals in 2001 found that one in five nurses plans to leave the profession within five years because of unsatisfactory working conditions, including low pay, severe under staffing, high stress, physical demands, mandatory overtime, and irregular hours. Approximately 29.8 percent of all nursing jobs are found in hospitals. However, because of administrative cost cutting, increased nurse's workload, and rapid growth of outpatient services, hospital nursing jobs will experience slower than average growth. Employment in home care and nursing homes is expected to grow rapidly. Though more people are living well into their 80s and 90s, many need the kind of long-term care available at a nursing home. Many nurses will also be needed to help staff the growing number of out-patient facilities, such as HMOs, group medical practices, and ambulatory surgery centers. Nursing specialties will be in great demand. There are, in addition, many part-time employment possibilities.\n\nLevsey, Campbell, and Green voiced their concern about the shortage of nurses, citing Fang, Wilsey-Wisniewski, & Bednash, 2006 who state that over 40,000 qualified nursing applicants were turned away in the 2005–2006 academic year from baccalaureate nursing programs due to a lack of masters and doctoral qualified faculty, and that this number was increased over 9,000 from 32,000 qualified but rejected students from just two years earlier. Several strategies have been offered to mitigate this shortage including; Federal and private support for experienced nurses to enhance their education, incorporating more hybrid/blended nursing courses, and using simulation in lieu of clinical (hospital) training experiences.\n\nFurthermore, there is a shortage of academically qualified instructors to teach at schools of nursing worldwide. The serious need for educational capacity is not being met, which is the underlying most important preparation resource for the nurses of tomorrow. The decrease in faculty everywhere is due to many factors including decrease in satisfaction with the workforce, poor salaries, and reduction in full-time equivalent. Throughout the span of 6 years the nursing faculty shortage has been written about an increasing amount. Unfortunately, there is no clear consensus or an organized plan on how to fix the ongoing issue.\n\nWith health care knowledge growing steadily, nurses can stay ahead of the curve through continuing education. Continuing education classes and programs enable nurses to provide the best possible care to patients, advance nursing careers, and keep up with Board of Nursing requirements. The American Nurses Association and the American Nursing Credentialing Center are devoted to ensuring nurses have access to quality continuing education offerings. Continuing education classes are calibrated to provide enhanced learning for all levels of nurses. Many States also regulate Continuing Nursing Education. Nursing licensing boards requiring Continuing Nursing Education (CNE) as a condition for licensure, either initial or renewal, accept courses provided by organizations that are accredited by other state licensing boards, by the American Nursing Credentialing Center (ANCC), or by organizations that have been designated as an approver of continuing nursing education by ANCC. There are some exceptions to this rule including the state of California, Florida and Kentucky. National Healthcare Institute has created a list to assist nurses in determining their CNE credit hours requirements. While this list is not all inclusive, it offers details on how to contact nursing licensing boards directly.<ref name=\"http://www.nursingworld.org/\"></ref><ref name=\"http://www.NHInstitute.org/\"></ref>\n\nProfessional nursing organizations, through their certification boards, have voluntary certification exams to demonstrate clinical competency in their particular specialty. Completion of the prerequisite work experience allows an RN to register for an examination, and passage gives an RN permission to use a professional designation after their name. For example, passage of the American Association of Critical-care Nurses specialty exam allows a nurse to use the initials 'CCRN' after his or her name. Other organizations and societies have similar procedures.\n\nThe American Nurses Credentialing Center, the credentialing arm of the American Nurses Association, is the largest nursing credentialing organization and administers more than 30 specialty examinations.\n\nThe Nursing education is governed in India by the central body Indian Nursing Council and its norms are implemented through respective State Nursing council such as Kerala Nurses and Midwives Council.\n\n"}

A higher score on any or all of these scales indicates a lower quality of life due to the disease.\n\nFirst published in 2009 by Galen Research and funded by Novartis Pharmaceuticals, the PRIMUS was developed in order to provide a more holistic view of the impact of MS on a patient.\n\nThe measure has three scales: quality of life, symptoms and activity limitations, which are designed to be used together or as standalone measures. The QoL and symptom scales are based on simple statements with dichotomous response options. Each scale has a total score which ranges from 0 to 22. The activity scale is based on 15 statements describing tasks. Patients are asked to rate their ability to perform these tasks on a scale from 1 to 3. The total score of the activities section ranges from 0 to 30.\n\nSince the development of the PRIMUS, it has been translated into several languages including Canadian English and French, French, German, Italian, Spanish, Swedish, US English, Australian and New Zealand English and US Spanish. This has allowed researchers to conduct studies for specific populations, such as Spain and Europe.\n\nThe PRIMUS has been utilized in clinical trials which assess the efficacy of a treatment or medication. If a patient’s score on the PRIMUS changes after a trial has taken place, it is inferred that the trial has had an effect on the patient’s quality of life. PRIMUS has been used to assess the efficacy of fingolimod and rivastigmine.\n"}

{"id": "49671872", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=49671872", "title": "Self-disorder", "text": "Self-disorder\n\nA self-disorder, also called ipseity disturbance, is a psychological phenomenon of disruption or diminishing of a person's sense of minimal (or basic) self. The sense of minimal self refers to the very basic sense of having experiences that are one's own; it has no properties, unlike the more extended sense of self, the narrative self, which is characterized by the person's reflections on themselves as a person, things they like, their identity, and other aspects that are the result of reflection on one's self. Disturbances in the sense of minimal self, as measured by the Examination of Anomalous Self-Experience (EASE), aggregate in the schizophrenia spectrum disorders, to include schizotypal personality disorder, and distinguish them from other conditions such as psychotic bipolar disorder and borderline personality disorder.\n\nThe minimal self has been likened to a \"flame that enlightens its surroundings and thereby itself.\" Unlike the extended self, which is composed of properties such as the person's identity, the person's narrative, and other aspects that can be gleaned from reflection, the minimal self has no properties, but refers to the \"mine-ness\" \"given-ness\" of experience, that the experiences are that of the person having them in that person's stream of consciousness. These experiences that are part of the minimal self are normally \"tacit\" and implied, requiring no reflection on the part of the person experiencing to know that the experience is theirs. The minimal self cannot be further elaborated and normally one cannot grasp it upon reflection. The minimal self goes hand-in-hand with immersion in the shared social world, such that \"[t]he world is always pregiven, ie, tacitly grasped as a self-evident background of all experiencing and meaning.\" This is the self-world structure.\n\nDe Warren gives an example of the minimal self combined with immersion in the shared social world: \"When looking at this tree in my backyard, my consciousness is directed toward the tree and not toward my own act of perception. I am, however, aware of myself as perceiving this tree, yet this self-awareness (or self-consciousness) is not itself thematic.\" The focus is normally on the tree itself, not on the person's own act of seeing the tree: to know that one is seeing the tree does not require an act of reflection.\n\nIn the schizophrenia spectrum disorders, the minimal self and the self-world structure are \"constantly \"challenged\", \"unstable\", and \"oscillating\",\" causing anomalous self-experiences known as self-disorders. These involve the person feeling as if they lack an identity, as if they are not really existing, that the sense of their experiences being their own (the \"mine-ness\" of their experiential world) is failing or diminishing, as if their inner experiences are no longer private, and that they don't really understand the world. These experiences lead to the person engaging in \"hyper-reflectivity\", or abnormally prolonged and intense self-reflection, to attempt to gain a grasp on these experiences, but such intense reflection may further exacerbate the self-disorders. Self-disorders tend to be chronic, becoming incorporated into the person's way of being and affecting \"how\" they experience the world and not necessarily \"what\" they experience. This instability of the minimal self may provoke the onset of psychosis.\n\nSimilar phenomena can occur in other conditions, such as bipolar disorder and depersonalization disorder, but Sass's (2014) review of the literature comparing accounts of self-experience in various mental disorders shows that serious self-other confusion and \"severe erosion of minimal self-experience\" only occur in schizophrenia; as an example of the latter, Sass cites the autobiographical account of Elyn Saks, who has schizophrenia, of her experience of \"disorganization\" in which she felt that thoughts, perceptions, sensations, and even the passage of time became incoherent, and that she had no longer \"the solid center from which one experiences reality\", which occurred when she was 7 or 8 years old. This disturbance tends to fluctuate over time based on emotions and motivation, accounting for the phenomenon of \"dialipsis\" in schizophrenia, where neurocognitive performance tends to be inconsistent over time.\n\nThe disturbance of the minimal self may manifest in people in various ways, including as a tendency to inspect one's thoughts in order to know what they are thinking, like a person seeing an image, reading a message, or listening closely to someone talking (\"audible thoughts\"; or in German: \"Gedankenlautwerden\"). In normal thought, the \"signifier\" (the images or inner speech representing the thought) and the \"meaning\" are combined into the \"expression\", so that the person \"inhabits\" their thinking, or that both the signifier and the meaning implicitly come to mind together; the person does not need to reflect on their thoughts to understand what they are thinking. In people with self-disorder, however, it is frequently the case that many thoughts are experienced as more like external objects that are not implicitly comprehended. The person must turn their focus toward the thoughts to understand their thoughts because of that lack of implicit comprehension, a split of the signifier and the meaning from each other, where the signifier emerges automatically in the field of awareness but the meaning does not. This is an example of the failing \"mine-ness\" of the experiential field as the minimal self recedes from its own thoughts, which are consigned to an outer space. This is present chronically, both during and outside of psychosis, and may represent a middle point between normal inner speech and auditory hallucinations, as well as normal experience and first-rank symptoms.\n\nThey may also experience uncontrolled multiple trains of thought with different themes simultaneously coursing through one's head interfering with concentration (\"thought pressure\") or often feel they must attend to things with their full attention in order to get done what most people can do without giving it much thought (\"hyper-reflectivity\"), which can lead to fatigue.\n\nThe EASE is a semi-structured interview that attempts to capture the extent of the mainly non-psychotic self-disorders experienced by the person. It is divided into 5 broad sections: \"Cognition and stream of consciousness\", which covers disturbances in the flow of thoughts and experiences, and includes such self-disorders as \"thought pressure\", an experienced chaos of unrelated thoughts, \"loss of thought ipseity\", a sense as if the person does not own their thoughts (but not to the level of psychosis), and \"spatialization of experience\", which is where the person experiences their thoughts as if they occurred within a space; \"self-awareness and presence\", which deals with dissociative experiences of the self and world as well as a tendency toward intense reflection, in addition to a declining understanding of how to interact with others and the world called \"perplexity\" or \"lack of natural evidence\"; \"bodily experiences\", which deals with alienating experiences of the body as well as with \"mimetic experiences\", the sense of a person that if they move, pseudo-movements of other, unrelated objects are experienced; \"demarcation/transitivism\", which covers specific disturbances in the person's ego boundaries such as the person confusing their own thoughts, ideas, and feelings for that of their interlocutor; and \"existential reorientation\", which refers to changes in the person's experience of the world that reflect the effect of self-disorders on the person's worldview. A large number of these items have affinities with the basic symptoms\n\nThe EASE, and pre-EASE studies attempting to assess basic self-disturbance, has been found in studies to discriminate between people on the schizophrenia spectrum, and those with psychotic bipolar disorder or borderline personality disorder. The EASE has been found to have good reliability, meaning that when 2 clinicians do the assessment, they draw roughly the same conclusions. The items on the EASE were compared against the accounted experiences of depersonalization disorder, finding many affinities, but also differences, reflecting namely the failing sense of \"mine-ness\" of the experiential world and a tendency to confuse the self with the world, others, or both.\n\nThe EAWE is the companion interview to the EASE that focuses on the person's experiences with the world, rather than with the self. There are 6 domains: \"Space and objects\", which deals with the person's experience with space and physical objects, with disorders including hallucinations, distortions of spatial relationships, and experiences of seeing the same object in multiple ways at the same time (called \"contamination\" on the Rorschach test); \"time and events\", which deals with the person's experience with time, with disorders involving time speeding up or slowing down, time breaking up or becoming fragmented, and constant anticipation of something major about to happen; \"other persons\", which deals with the person's experience of other people, with disorders including disruptions of the sense of ego boundaries with other people, referential ideation based on actions or words by other people, and loss or lack of the ability to naturally understand social situations and social cues leading to attempts to compensate through increased focus or concentration; \"language\", which deals with reduced fluency and disruption of prose in one's native language, distortions in the person's expression which causes others to misunderstand the person, problems with concrete and abstract concepts, and distraction by individual words and phrases leading to the person having difficulty following what they are reading or listening to; \"atmosphere\", which deals with the person's overall feeling-state of the world, with disorders including derealization (particularly \"The Truman Show\"-style derealization), objects no longer having normal meaning, hyper-awareness of things that normally stay in the background of awareness, apophanous mood, and a sense of radical changes in the very structure of the universe itself; and \"existential orientation\", which deals with radical changes in a person's worldview, dealing with such things as rejecting society's conventions and rules, being extremely open to believing new ideas, and grandiosity which involves the person considering others to be inferior, like insects compared to them.\n\n\nThe presence of self-disorders may have predictive power for whether those with an at risk mental state will develop psychosis; the risk of suicidal ideation and suicide by people with schizophrenia, though depression would also be an important factor; predicting initial social dysfunction in people with either schizophrenic or bipolar psychosis; and whether a person will move to a schizophrenia spectrum diagnosis later.\n\nThe presence of self-disorders may cause reduced person insight into their illness through the alteration of the basic structures of consciousness.\n\nSelf-disorders are difficult for the people experiencing them to articulate spontaneously; and are not well-known, by either the general public or professionals in the field. Because of this, people will often make vague, cliched complaints that mimic the symptoms of other mental disorders, symptoms such as \"fatigue\" or \"concentration difficulties\". Were a knowledgeable clinician to probe deeper, however, the underlying self-disorders may be assessed and help clarify the nature of the person's illness. In their review, Parnas, et al. (2014) say, \"The psychiatrist’s acquaintance with the phenomenon of 'non-specific specificity' is, in our view, extremely important in the context of early diagnostic assessment, especially of people presenting with a vague, unelaborated picture of maladjustment, underperformance, chronic malaise and dysphoria, negative symptoms, or hypochondriac preoccupations.\" People with schizophrenia often describe their self-disorders as causing more suffering for them than psychosis.\n\nSelf-disorders underlie most of the first-rank symptoms, those often termed passivity phenomena. There is a current proposal to list self-disorder as one of the symptoms of schizophrenia in the upcoming ICD-11.\n\nIn a 2014 review, Postmes, et al., suggested that self-disorders and psychosis may arise from attempts to compensate for perceptual incoherence and proposed a hypothesis for how the interaction among these phenomena and the person's attempts to resolve the incoherence give rise to schizophrenia. The problems with the integration of sensory information create problems for the person in keeping a grip on the world, and since the self-world interaction is fundamentally linked to the basic sense of self, the latter is also disrupted as a result. Sass and Borda have studied the correlates of the dimensions of self-disorders, namely \"disturbed grip\" (perplexity, difficulty \"getting\" stuff most people can get), \"hyperreflexivity\" (where thoughts, feelings, sensations, and objects pop up uncontrollably in the field of awareness, as well dysfunctional reflecting on matters and the self), and \"diminished self-affection\" (where the person has difficulty being \"affected\" by aspects of the self, experiencing those aspects as if they existed in an outer space), and have proposed how both primary and secondary factors may arise from dysfunctions in perceptual organization and multisensory integration.\n\nIn a 2013 review, Mishara, et al., criticized the concept of the minimal self as an explanation for self-disorder, saying that it is unfalsifiable, and that self-disorder arises primarily from difficulty integrating different aspects of the self as well as having difficulty distinguishing self and other, as proposed by Lysaker and Lysaker: \"Ichstörung\" or ego disorder, as they say, in schizophrenia arises from disturbed relationships not from the \"solipsistic\" concept of the self as proposed by Sass, Parnas, and others. In his review, Sass agrees that the focus of research into self-disorder has focused too much on the self, and mentions attempts to look at disturbances in the person's relationship with other people and the world, with work being done to create an Examination of Anomalous World Experience, which will look at the person's anomalous experiences regarding time, space, persons, language, and atmosphere; he suggests there are problems with both the self and the world in people with self-disorder, and that it may be better conceptualized as a \"presence-disturbance\". Parnas acknowledges the Lysaker model, but says that it is not incompatible with the concept of the minimal self, as they deal with different levels of self-hood.\n\nThe concept of a basic self-disturbance in schizophrenia appears in all the foundational texts on the disease. However, the concept was difficult to operationalize and was criticized for being vague and too subjective; little systematic or empirical research was done on the concept in the 20th century. The publication of the DSM-III (1980) had unintended consequences, however, and led, in many instances, to focusing only on the signs and symptoms listed as criteria and generally ignoring the other signs and symptoms that can appear with each disorder; it privileged a behaviorist approach to diagnosis. The concept of this self-disturbance soon disappeared from training programs in the United States.\n\nThe Bonn Scale for the Assessment of Basic Symptoms was created to assess sub-clinical affective, cognitive and perceptual disturbances, as well as basic self-disturbance, in people, and in many studies basic symptoms were found to aggregate in people with schizophrenic and schizotypal disorders. Basic symptoms are subjective and difficult for the person to describe spontaneously, but the person will try to adapt and cope with them: functioning becomes impaired when people reach their adaptive capacity. In the period leading up to the first episode of schizophrenia, uncharacteristic basic symptoms first appear and are followed by the onset of more characteristic basic symptoms and, finally, psychosis.\n\nTo revive the concept of basic self-disturbance and to overcome the previous problems of a lack of a concrete definition of it, a group of researchers developed the EASE, based on phenomenological interviews with first-admission people with schizophrenia spectrum disorders, to enable empirical research of self-disorders.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "3172298", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=3172298", "title": "Siraitia grosvenorii", "text": "Siraitia grosvenorii\n\nSiraitia grosvenorii (luo han guo or monk fruit) is a herbaceous perennial vine of the Cucurbitaceae (gourd) family, native to southern China and northern Thailand. The plant is cultivated for its fruit, whose extract is nearly 300 times sweeter than sugar and has been used in China as a low-calorie sweetener for cooling drinks and in traditional Chinese medicine.\n\nThe plant's fruit is often called in English language publications luo han guo or lo han kuo (from the Chinese \"luóhàn guǒ\", 罗汉果/羅漢果).\n\nThe scientific species name honors Gilbert Hovey Grosvenor, who as president of the National Geographic Society, helped to fund an expedition in the 1930s to find the living plant in China where it was being cultivated.\n\nThe fruit was first mentioned in the records of 13th-century Chinese monks in Guangxi in the region of Guilin. The difficulty of cultivation meant the fruit did not become part of the Chinese herbal tradition which depended on more readily available products.\n\n\"Luóhàn\" (羅漢) is a shortened form of \"āluóhàn\" (), which is an old transliteration of the Indian Sanskrit word \"arhat\" (prakrit: \"arahant\"). In early Buddhist traditions, a monk who becomes enlightened is called an \"arhat\" who attains the \"fruition of arhatship\" (Sanskrit: \"arhattaphala\"). This was rendered in Chinese as \"luóhàn guǒ\" (羅漢果 literally \"arhat fruit\") which later became the Chinese and western commercial designation for this type of sweet fruit.\n\nIt may also be called \"la han qua\" (from Vietnamese \"la hán quả\"), Buddha fruit, or longevity fruit (also used for other fruits).\n\nThe first report in England on the herb was found in an unpublished manuscript written in 1938 by G. Weidman Groff and Hoh Hin Cheung. The report stated the fruits were often used as the main ingredients of \"cooling drinks\" as remedies for hot weather, fever, or other dysfunctions traditionally associated with warmth or heat (i.e. inflammation).\n\nThe fruit was taken to the United States in the early 20th century. Groff mentioned that, during a visit to the American ministry of agriculture in 1917, the botanist Frederick Coville showed him a \"luo han guo\" fruit bought in a Chinese shop in Washington, DC. Seeds of the fruit, which had been bought in a Chinese shop in San Francisco, were entered into the botanic description of the species in 1941.\n\nThe first research into the sweet component of \"luo han guo\" is attributed to C. H. Lee, who wrote an English report on it in 1975, and also to Tsunematsu Takemoto, who worked on it the early 1980s in Japan (later Takemoto decided to concentrate on the similar sweet plant, \"jiaogulan\").\n\nThe development of \"luo han guo\" products in China has continued ever since, focusing in particular on the development of concentrated extracts.\n\nThe vine attains a length of 3 to 5 m, climbing over other plants by means of tendrils which twine around anything they touch. The narrow, heart-shaped leaves are 10–20 cm long. The fruit is round, 5–7 cm in diameter, smooth, yellow-brownish or green-brownish in color, containing striations from the fruit stem end of the furrows with a hard but thin skin covered by fine hairs. The inside of the fruit contains an edible pulp, which, when dried, forms a thin, light brown, brittle shell about 1 mm in thickness. The seeds are elongated and almost spherical.\n\nThe interior fruit is eaten fresh, and the rind is used to make tea.\n\nThe monk fruit is notable for its sweetness, which can be concentrated from its juice. The fruit contains 25 to 38% of various carbohydrates, mainly fructose and glucose. The sweetness of the fruit is increased by the mogrosides, a group of triterpene glycosides (saponins). The five different mogrosides are numbered from I to V; the main component is mogroside V, which is also known as esgoside.\n\nGermination of seeds is slow and may take several months. It is grown primarily in the far southern Chinese province of Guangxi (mostly in the mountains near Guilin), as well as in Guangdong, Guizhou, Hunan, and Jiangxi. These mountains lend the plants shade and often are surrounded by mists which protect the plants from the sun. Nonetheless, the climate in this southern province is warm. The plant is rarely found in the wild, so it has been cultivated for hundreds of years.\n\nRecords as early as 1813 mention the cultivation of this plant in the Guangxi province. Most of the plantations are located in Yongfu County and Lingui County.\n\nLongjiang Town in Yongfu County has acquired the name \"home of the Chinese \"luohanguo\" fruit\"; a number of companies specialised in making \"luohanguo\" extracts and finished products have been set up in the area. The Yongfu Pharmaceutical Factory is the oldest of these.\n\n\"Luohan guo\" is harvested in the form of a round, green fruit, which becomes brown on drying. It is rarely used in its fresh form, as it is hard to store.\n\nThus, the fruits are usually dried before further use and are sold in this fashion in Chinese herbal shops. The fruits are slowly dried in ovens, preserving them and removing most of the unwanted aromas. However, this technique also leads to the formation of several bitter and astringent flavors. This limits the use of the dried fruits and extracts to the preparation of diluted tea, soup, and as a sweetener for products that would usually have sugar or honey added to them.\n\nThe process for the manufacture of a useful sweetener from \"luo han guo\" was patented in 1995 by Procter & Gamble. The patent states that natural \"luo han guo\" has many interfering flavors, which render it useless for general applications, and describes a process to remove them. The offending compounds are sulfur-containing volatile substances such as hydrogen disulfide, methional, methionol, dimethylsulfide, and methylmercaptan, which are formed from amino acids that contain sulfur, such as methionine, S-methylmethionine, cystine, and cysteine.\n\nThe sweet taste of the fruit comes mainly from mogrosides, a group of triterpene glycosides that make up about 1% of the flesh of the fresh fruit. Through solvent extraction, a powder containing 80% mogrosides can be obtained, the main one being mogroside-5 (esgoside). Other similar agents in the fruit are siamenoside and neomogroside.\n\nIn this process, the shell and seeds are removed, and the pulped fruit is made into a fruit concentrate or puree. Additional juice may be extracted from the remaining pulp by hot water. The juice is homogenized, slightly acidified to prevent gelling and improve the flavor, then treated with pectinase or other enzymes to break down the pectin. Most of the off-flavor agents are then removed with ion-exchange resins, such as sulfonated polystyrene-divinylbenzene copolymer or polyacrylic acid. Alternatively, the off-flavors can be adsorbed by agents like charcoal or bentonite, which are removed by filtration; or precipitated with gelatin or other gelling agents. Most of the remaining sulfurous volatiles are then removed by low-pressure evaporation. The juice is then pasteurized to inactivate remaining natural enzymes and kill micro-organisms. The process is claimed to preserve a substantial fraction of the mogrosides present in the fruit.\n\nAt least one generally recognized as safe (GRAS) notice has been received by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration.\n\nIn Europe, it is classified as an unapproved Novel Food (not used in the food system before May 1997) which means that it may be marketed as a food or food ingredient only after a safety assessment and approval by the European Commission; as of 2017, \"Siraitia grosvenorii\" was not listed among approved Novel Foods in the EU.\n\nThe plant is most prized for its sweet fruits, which are used for medicinal purposes and as a sweetener. In traditional Chinese medicine, it is used for cough and sore throat and in southern China it is believed to be a longevity aid. The fruits are generally sold in dried form, and traditionally used in herbal tea or soup.\n\n"}

The toxin is naturally found in some cheeses. \n\nSterigmatocystin is a toxic metabolite structurally closely related to the aflatoxins, and consists of a xanthone nucleus attached to a bifuran structure. Sterigmatocystin is mainly produced by the fungi \"Aspergillus nidulans\" and \"A. versicolor\". It has been reported in mouldy grain, green coffee beans and cheese although information on its occurrence in foods is limited. It appears to occur much less frequently than the aflatoxins, although analytical methods for its determination have not been as sensitive until recently, and so it is possible that small concentrations in food commodities may not always have been detected. Although it is a potent liver carcinogen similar to aflatoxin B1, current knowledge suggests that it is nowhere near as widespread in its occurrence. If this is the true situation it would be justified to consider sterigmatocystin as no more than a risk to consumers in special or unusual circumstances. A number of closely related compounds such as o-methyl sterigmatocystin are known, and some may also occur naturally.\n\nSterigmatocystin forms pale yellow needles and that are readily soluble in methanol, ethanol, acetonitrile, benzene, and chloroform. Sterigmatocystin reacts with a hot solution of potassium hydroxide and ethanol and is easily methylated by methyl iodide. Treatment with ethanol in acid produces dihydroethoxysterigmatocystin.\n\nThe toxic effects of sterigmatocystin are much the same as those of aflatoxin B1. It is thus considered as a potent carcinogen, mutagen, and teratogen. It is less acutely toxic to rodents and monkeys but appears to be slightly more toxic to zebra fish. The LD50 in mice is in excess of 800 mg/kg. The 10-day LD50 in Wistar rats is 166 mg/kg in males, 120 mg/kg in females, and 60-65 mg/kg for ip. administration in males. The ip. 10-day LD50 for vervet monkeys is 32 mg/kg.\n\nChronic symptoms include induction of hepatomas in rats, pulmonary tumours in mice, renal lesions and alterations in the liver and kidneys of African Green monkeys. Rats fed 5-10 mg/kg of sterigmatocystin for two years showed a 90% incidence of liver tumours. It has been suggested that sterigmatocystin is about 1/10 as potent a carcinogen as aflatoxin B1.\n\nToxic effects of sterigmatocystin-fed laboratory animals have included kidney and liver damage and diarrhoea. Skin and hepatic tumours are induced in rats by dermal application. Cattle exhibiting bloody diarrhoea, loss of milk production and in some cases death were found to have ingested feed containing Aspergillus versicolor and high levels of sterigmatocystin of about 8 mg/kg. The acute toxicity, carcinogenicity, and metabolism of sterigmatocystin has been compared with those for aflatoxin and several other hepatotoxic mycotoxins. \n\nThe IARC-classification of sterigmatocystin is group 2B, which means it is carcinogenic in other species and is possibly carcinogenic to humans, but that a definitive link between human exposure and cancer has not been proven.\n\nThe occurrence of sterigmatocystin in raw materials and foods has not been reported often. The instances reported have usually been on mouldy, or poor quality materials such as wheat, maize, animal feed, hard cheese, pecan nuts and green coffee beans. While this lack of information may be due to deficiencies in the analytical methods, where surveys of good quality products have been carried out with reliable methodology, sterigmatocystin has rarely if ever been found. However, further assurance is required before sterigmatocystin can finally be dismissed as a risk because A. versicolor has been isolated frequently from cereals, grain products, fruits and marmalade, dried meat products and grapefruit juice. Relatively high levels of sterigmatocystin have been formed in bread, cured ham and salami after inoculation with A. versicolor. More than in food, sterigmatocystin is frequently found in water-damaged buildings *.\n\nMethods for extraction of sterigmatocystin have been commonly based on a mixture of acetonitrile and 4% aqueous potassium chloride. Methods for detection using TLC are not very sensitive having a limit of detection in the range 20-50 microgrammes/kg. TLC plates must be sprayed with aluminium chloride and heated. Analytical methods for the determination of sterigmatocystin have been reported using HPLC but again these are not very sensitive because of lack of UV absorbance or fluorescence, although a post column reaction with aluminium chloride has been used to increase sensitivity. More recently, methods using HPLC linked with atmospheric pressure ionisation mass spectrometric detection have been developed for foods such as cheese, bread and corn products. \n\nThere appear to be no reports about the stability of sterigmatocystin, other than in solution, where it is similar to the aflatoxins. There is one report that phosphine gas significantly depresses the formation of sterigmatocystin when cereals are inoculated with A. versicolor. \n\nNo country has legislation for sterigmatocystin. Natural occurrence appears to be infrequent although only a limited number of surveys have been carried out. Soon after it was recognised as a highly toxic compound, the California Department of Health Services used TD50 values from the Cancer Potency Database to produce ‘no significant risk’ intake levels for humans. The level resulting was 8 microgrammes/kg body weight/day for a 70 kg adult\n\n\n"}

The Lullaby Trust funds research, supports families whose babies have died suddenly and unexpectedly, disseminates information on infant health, baby care and sudden infant deaths to health professionals and the general public, and works with professionals to improve investigations when a baby dies.\n\nSudden Infant Death is the sudden and unexpected death of a baby or toddler that is initially unexplained. Deaths that remain unexplained after a post mortem examination are often classified as SIDS (Sudden Infant Death Syndrome). It has been known in the past as Cot Death, however this term is misleading as evidence shows that not all cases of SIDS occurred when a baby was in a cot, and so the term has been largely abandoned.\n\nOver a third of a century ago – in 1971 – a meeting was convened in Cambridge as a result of one grandmother's search to find out why her baby grandson had died suddenly and unexpectedly. This gathering led to the founding of the world's first organisation devoted to research, information and support in the field of infant deaths.\n\nSince The Lullaby Trust teamed up with the Department of Health to launch the campaign to reduce the risk of sudden infant death in 1991, the UK sudden infant death rate has fallen by 75%, and has been hailed one of the most successful public health campaigns ever, estimated to have saved more than 20,000 lives.\n\nThe Lullaby Trust has gone on to become one of the world's leading authorities on sudden infant death, the UK's largest funder of medical research into sudden infant death, the main source of support for bereaved families and a major information provider.\n\n\nThe Lullaby Trust operates throughout England, Wales and Northern Ireland. As well as the team in head office there are also eight Regional Development Officers who actively promote The Lullaby Trust's campaigns across the country.\n\nEvents to raise money for The Lullaby Trust range from skydives to marathons, treks and cycles. An example of a fundraising event is the Mile in Memory walk, undertaken to honour the life of someone special to the supporter. In 2012, the event raised £67,000 and took place in over 65 different venues.\n\nIn 2012, British Independent Record label, Audio Antihero, released a benefit compilation album titled \"Some.Alternate.Universe\" to raise money for The Lullaby Trust. The album featured artists like Jeffrey Lewis, Nosferatu D2, Jonah Matranga, Benjamin Shaw, Eddie Argos (Art Brut), Jack Hayter (Hefner), Still Corners, Fighting Kites, Johnny Foreigner, Paul Hawkins & The Awkward Silences.\n\n"}

IN 1978, RISNA decided to relinquish its collective bargaining functions and encouraged its collective bargaining units to join with another union. After interviewing several unions, the roughly 400 former RISNA members chose to affiliate with the Federation of Nurses and Health Professionals (FNHP) of the American Federation of Teachers, and its state affiliate, the Rhode Island Federation of Teachers (RIFT).\n\nBetween 1978 and 1998, the FNHP successfully organized RNs and other health care workers at Memorial Hospital, Woonsocket Hospital (now Landmark Medical Center), Westerly Hospital, RI Hospital, and Fatima Hospital, bringing the RIFT’s total health membership to 3,500. Inspired by the energy of a rapidly growing union, and the urgency of a rapidly changing industry, the FNHP leaders approached the RIFT leadership with a proposal to organize their locals into a semi-autonomous health care division within the RIFT. When the RIFT rejected this option, the members of eight RIFT health care locals voted overwhelmingly to disaffiliate from the RIFT in order to concentrate their efforts and resources as an independent health care union. They called their new union the UNAP.\n\nNot long after the formation of the UNAP, two chapters of an existing RIFT visiting nurse local also voted to leave the RIFT and join the UNAP. They were followed in 1999 by an AFT local at Brattleboro Retreat, a psychiatric facility in Brattleboro, Vermont, and, soon after, by an AFT local of registered nurses at Copley Hospital in Vermont.\n\nThe United Nurses & Allied Professionals (UNAP) is a labor union in the United States which represents UNAP has had continued success in organizing new members. In 1999, UNAP organized a small group of public school nurses in Putnam, Connecticut. In 2004, UNAP organized social service workers in Youth Services, and in 2005 it organized clinicians at Health Care and Rehabilitative Services—both in Brattleboro. In January 2006, the union won an election for employees working in the adult services at the Homestead Group (formerly the Association for Retarded Citizens of Northern Rhode Island). In 2008, the UNAP organized 650 Registered Nurses at Kent Hospital, the second largest hospital in Rhode Island. The UNAP also organized large numbers of members in residual bargaining units at Landmark Medical Center, Rehabilitation Hospital of RI, Westerly Hospital, and Brattleboro Retreat.\n\nUNAP is a federation of affiliated local unions which have their own constitution, officers, and treasury. UNAP is governed by an Executive Council that includes a president, executive vice president, two vice presidents, secretary, treasurer and the president of each affiliated local. UNAP officers are elected at the UNAP bi-annual convention by delegates from each local. Lynn Blais, a nurse at Fatima Hospital, was the organization's first president. In 2001, Blais stepped down and Linda McDonald, an RN at Rhode Island Hospital, was elected president. (Blais was elected one of two vice presidents.)\n\nThe UNAP provides a wide variety of services to its locals and members, including collective bargaining, continuing education, legal, research, political action, communications, and organizing. Nationally, UNAP has at times worked closely with the California Nurses Association, the Massachusetts Nurses Association, and the Service Employees International Union. However, it remains firmly independent.\n\n"}
{"id": "2260123", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2260123", "title": "Van der Woude syndrome", "text": "Van der Woude syndrome\n\nVan der Woude syndrome (VDWS) is a genetic disorder characterized by the combination of lower lip pits, cleft lip with or without cleft palate, and cleft palate alone (CP). The frequency of orofacial clefts ranges from 1:1000 to 1:500 births worldwide, and there are more than 400 syndromes that involve cleft lip with or without cleft palate. VWS is distinct from other clefting syndromes due to the combination of cleft lip and palate (CLP) and CP within the same family. Other features frequently associated with VWS include hypodontia in 10-81% of cases, narrow arched palate, congenital heart disease, heart murmur and cerebral abnormalities, syndactyly of the hands, polythelia, ankyloglossia, and adhesions between the upper and lower gum pads.\n\nThe association between lower lip pits and cleft lip and/or palate was first described by Anne Van der Woude in 1954. The worldwide disease incidence ranges from 1:100,000 to 1:40,000.\n\nVan der Woude syndrome is inherited as an autosomal dominant disease caused by a mutation in a single gene with equal distribution between the sexes. The disease has high penetrance at about 96% but the phenotypic expression varies from lower lip pits with cleft lip and cleft palate to no visible abnormalities. Approximately 88% of VWS patients display lower lip pits, and in about 64% of cases lip pits are the only visible defect. Reported clefting covers a wide range including submucous cleft palate, incomplete unilateral CL, bifid uvula, and complete bilateral CLP. VWS is the most common orofacial clefting syndrome, accounting for 2% of CLP cases.\n\nThe majority of VWS cases are caused by haploinsufficiency due to mutations in the interferon regulatory factor 6 gene (\"IRF6\") on chromosome 1 in the 1q32-q41 region known as VWS locus 1. A second, less common, causative locus is found at 1p34, known as VWS locus 2 (VWS2). More recent work has shown that GRHL3 is the VWS2 gene. \"Grhl3\" is downstream of \"Irf6\" in oral epithlium, suggesting a common molecular pathway leading to VWS. Prior work also suggested \"WDR65\" as a candidate gene. \"IRF6\" contains two non-coding and seven coding exons and is part of a family of nine transcription factors with a highly conserved helix-turn-helix DNA binding domain called the Smad-interferon regulatory factor binding domain (SMIR). Mutations in coding or non-coding \"IRF6\" exons can result in Van der Woude syndrome. Due to the wide range of expressivity, it is also believed that other unidentified loci contribute to disease development.\n\nAn example of the clear phenotypic variability is a monozygotic twin study conducted by Jobling et al. (2010). Two monozygotic female twins had the same \"IRF6\" mutation; however Twin A was born with a bilateral cleft lip, whereas Twin B had bilateral lip pits and no orofacial clefting. Both twins were diagnosed with VWS. The twins' father had lip pits alone and a family history of CLP, CP, CL, and/or lip pits. Both twins were diagnosed with VWS. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplification was done for all exons of \"IRF6\", and a missense mutation was discovered in exon 4. The tyrosine in the normal protein at this position is conserved across mammals, frogs, and chickens, so despite the fact that it was a previously unreported mutation, it was expected to be deleterious. This study is not the first case of different phenotypes occurring between monozygotic twins. Possible causes of phenotypic variability include variations in the intrauterine environment, epigenetic differences, or chance effects.\n\nLip pits were first reported in 1845 by Demarquay who thought they were indentations made by the upper incisors. Today it is known that they occur during embryogenesis due to \"IRF6\" mutations. On day 32 of embryonic development there are four growth centers of the lower lip divided by two lateral grooves and one median. By day 38 of normal development, the grooves have disappeared. However, when growth of the mandibular process is impeded, a lip pit occurs. Lip pits begin to develop on day 36. Cleft lip begins to develop on day 40, and cleft palate emerges on day 50 of development.\n\nThere are three types of lip pits, which are classified according to their location: midline upper, comissural, and lower lip. The most common phenotype is two symmetrical lower lip pits flanking both sides of the midline in the bilateral paramedial sinuses. Lower lip pits may also be bilaterally, unilaterally, or medially asymmetrical. The occurrence of a single lip pit is considered incomplete expression, and it typically occurs on the left side of the lower lip. There are also three different shapes for lip pits, the most common being circular or oval; less common forms include slit-like or transverse. The lip pits extend into the orbicularis oris muscle, ending in blind sacs surrounded by mucous glands. In some cases mucous is excreted when the muscles contract.\n\nClinical diagnosis based on orofacial clefts and lip pits typically occurs shortly after birth. Certain defects may be difficult to diagnose, particularly a submucous cleft palate. This form of CP may not be detected except through finger palpation, as the mucosa covering the palate is intact, but the muscles underneath have lost their proper attachments. Feeding problems, impaired speech, and hearing loss are symptoms of a submucous cleft palate. Furthermore, approximately 15% of VWS cases with orofacial clefts, in the absence of prominent lip pits, cannot be easily distinguished from non-syndromic forms of orofacial clefting. Therefore, it is very important to closely examine these patients as well as their relatives for lip pits, especially when there is a family history of mixed clefting, in order to make the VWS diagnosis. Dentists may also play an important role in diagnosing cases not detected at birth, as they detect hypodontia commonly associated with VWS. The \npatients most commonly lack the upper second premolars followed by the lower second premolars and upper lateral incisors. The absence of these teeth might play a role in the constricting of the dental arches.\n\nThe clinical signs seen in VWS are similar to those of popliteal pterygium syndrome (PPS), which is also an autosomal dominant disease. Approximately 46% of affected individuals have lip pits; other features include genital abnormalities, abnormal skin near nails, syndactyly of fingers and toes, and webbed skin. The disease is also caused by mutations in \"IRF6\"; however, they occur in the DNA-binding domain of \"IRF6\" and result in a dominant negative effect in which the mutated IRF6 transcription factor interferes with the ability of the wild type copy to function, in the case of a heterozygous individual.\nGenetic counseling for VWS involves discussion of disease transmission in the autosomal dominant manner and possibilities for penetrance and expression in offspring. Autosomal dominance means affected parents have a 50% chance of passing on their mutated \"IRF6\" allele to a their child. Furthermore, if a cleft patient has lip pits, he or she has a ten times greater risk of having a child with cleft lip with or without cleft palate than a cleft patient who does not have lip pits. Types of clefting between parents and affected children are significantly associated; however, different types of clefts may occur horizontally and vertically within the same pedigree. In cases where clefting is the only symptom, a complete family history must be taken to ensure the patient does not have non-syndromic clefting.\n\nLip pits may be surgically removed either for aesthetic reasons or discomfort due to inflammation caused by bacterial infections or chronic saliva excretion, though spontaneous shrinkage of the lip pits has occurred in some rare cases. Chronic inflammation has also been reported to cause squamous-cell carcinoma. It is essential to completely remove the entire lip pit canal, as mucoid cysts can develop if mucous glands are not removed. A possible side effect of removing the lip pits is a loose lip muscle. Other conditions associated with VWS, including CL, CP, congenital heart defects, etc. are surgically corrected or otherwise treated as they would be if they were non-syndromic.\n"}
{"id": "269676", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=269676", "title": "Wet nurse", "text": "Wet nurse\n\nA wet nurse is a woman who breast feeds and cares for another's child. Wet nurses are employed if the mother dies, or if she is unable or elects not to nurse the child herself. Wet-nursed children may be known as \"milk-siblings\", and in some cultures the families are linked by a special relationship of milk kinship. Mothers who nurse each other's babies are engaging in a reciprocal act known as cross-nursing or co-nursing. Wetnursing existed in cultures around the world until the invention of reliable formula milk in the 20th century.\n\nA wet nurse can help when a mother is unable or unwilling to feed her baby. Before the development of infant formula in the 20th century, when a mother was unable to breastfeed, a wetnurse was the only way to save the baby's life. \n\nThere are many reasons why a mother is unable to produce sufficient breast milk, or in some cases to lactate at all. Reasons include the serious or chronic illness of the mother and her treatment which creates a temporary difficulty to nursing. Additionally, a mother's taking drugs (prescription or recreational) may necessitate a wet nurse if a drug in any way changes the content of the mother's milk. \n\nThere was also an increased need for wetnurses when the rates of infant abandonment by mothers, and maternal death during childbirth, were high.\n\nSome women choose not to breastfeed for social reasons. Many of these women were found to be of the upper class. For them, breastfeeding was considered unfashionable, in the sense that it not only prevented these women from being able to wear the fashionable clothing of their time but it was also thought to ruin their figures. Mothers also lacked the support of their husbands to breastfeed their children, since hiring a wet nurse was less expensive than having to hire someone else to help run the family business and/or take care of the family household duties in their place. Some women chose to hire wet nurses purely to escape from the confining and time-consuming chore of breastfeeding. Wet nurses have also been used when a mother cannot produce sufficient breast milk, i.e., the mother feels incapable of adequately nursing her child, especially following multiple births.\n\nA woman can only act as a wet-nurse if she is lactating (producing milk). It was once believed that a wet-nurse must have recently undergone childbirth. This is not necessarily the case, as regular breast suckling can elicit lactation via a neural reflex of prolactin production and secretion. Some adoptive mothers have been able to establish lactation using a breast pump so that they could feed an adopted infant.\n\nDr Gabrielle Palmer states: \n\nWet nursing is an ancient practice, common to many cultures. It has been linked to social class, where monarchies, the aristocracy, nobility or upper classes had their children wet-nursed for the benefit of the child's health, and sometimes in the hope of becoming pregnant again quickly. Exclusive breastfeeding inhibits ovulation in some women (Lactational amenorrhea). Poor women, especially those who suffered the stigma of giving birth to an illegitimate child, sometimes had to give their baby up, temporarily to a wet-nurse, or permanently to another family. Dating back to the Roman times and up until the present day, philosophers and thinkers alike have agreed that the important emotional bond between mother and child is threatened by the presence of a wet nurse. \n\nMany cultures feature stories, historical or mythological, involving superhuman, supernatural, human and in some instances animal wet-nurses.\n\nThe Bible refers to Deborah, a nurse to Rebekah wife of Isaac and mother of Jacob (Israel) and Esau, who appears to have lived as a member of the household all her days. (Genesis 35:8.) Midrashic commentaries on the Torah hold that the Egyptian princess Bithiah (Pharaoh's wife Asiya in the Islamic Hadith and Qur'an) attempted to wet-nurse Moses, but he would take only his biological mother's milk. ()\n\nIn Greek mythology, Eurycleia is the wet-nurse of Odysseus. In Roman mythology, Caieta was the wet-nurse of Aeneas. In Burmese mythology, Myaukhpet Shinma is the \"nat\" (spirit) representation of the wet nurse of King Tabinshwehti. In Hawaiian mythology, Nuakea is a beneficent goddess of lactation; her name became the title for a royal wetnurse, according to David Malo.\n\nIn ancient Rome, well-to-do households would have had wet-nurses (Latin \"nutrices\", singular \"nutrix\") among their slaves and freedwomen, but some Roman women were wet-nurses by profession, and the \"Digest\" of Roman law even refers to a wage dispute for wet-nursing services \"(nutricia)\". The landmark known as the Columna Lactaria (\"Milk Column\") may have been a place where wet-nurses could be hired. It was considered admirable for upperclass women to breastfeed their own children, but unusual and old-fashioned in the Imperial era. Even women of the working classes or slaves might have their babies nursed, and the Roman-era Greek gynecologist Soranus offers detailed advice on how to choose a wet-nurse. Inscriptions such as religious dedications and epitaphs indicate that a \"nutrix\" would be proud of her profession. One even records a \"nutritor lactaneus\", a male \"milk nurse\" who presumably used a bottle. Greek nurses were preferred, and the Romans believed that a baby who had a Greek \"nutrix\" could imbibe the language and grow up speaking Greek as fluently as Latin. \n\nThe importance of the wet nurse to ancient Roman culture is indicated by the founding myth of Romulus and Remus, who were abandoned as infants but nursed by the she-wolf, as portrayed in the famous Capitoline Wolf bronze sculpture. The goddess Rumina was invoked among other birth and child development deities to promote the flow of breast milk.\n\nWet nursing was commonplace in the British Isles. \n\nFor years, wet-nursing was a well-paid, respectable and popular job for many lower class women in England. In 17th- and 18th-century Britain, a woman would earn more money as a wet nurse than her husband could as a labourer. Up until the 19th century, most wet-nursed infants were sent far from their families to live with their wet nurse for up to the first three years of their life. As many as 80 percent of wet-nursed babies who lived with their wet nurses died during infancy, which led to a change in living conditions. \n\nWomen took in babies for money in Victorian Britain, and nursed them themselves or fed them with whatever was cheapest. This was known as baby-farming; poor care sometimes resulted in high infant death rates. The wetnurse at this period was most likely a single woman who previously had given birth to an illegitimate child. There were two types of wet nurses in Victorian England. There were those on poor relief, who struggled to provide sufficiently for themselves or their charges, and there were professional wet nurses who were well paid and respected. \n\nIt was common for upper-class women to hire wet nurses to breastfeed their children. English women tended to work within their employers' homes to take care of their charge, as well as working at foundling hospitals for abandoned children. The wet nurse's own child would likely be sent out to nurse, normally brought up by the bottle rather than being breastfed. Valerie Fildes, author of \"Breasts, Bottle and Babies: A History of Infant Feeding\", argues that \"In effect, wealthy parents frequently 'bought' the life of their infant for the life of another.\" \n\nWet nursing in England decreased in popularity during the mid-19th century due to the writings of medical journalists concerning the undocumented dangers of wet nursing. Valerie Fildes argued that \"Britain has been lumped together with the rest of Europe in any discussion of the qualities, terms of employment and conditions of the wet nurse, and particularly the abuses of which she was supposedly guilty.\" According to C.H.F. Routh, a medical journalist writing in the late 1850s in England, argued many evils of wet-nursing, such as wet-nurses were more likely to abandon their own children, there was increased mortality for children under the charge of a wet-nurse, and an increased physical and moral risk to a nursed child. While this argument was not founded in any sort of proof, the emotional arguments of medical researchers, coupled with the protests of critics of the practice slowly increased public knowledge and brought wet-nursing into obscurity, replaced by maternal breastfeeding and bottle-feeding.\n\nWet nursing was reported in France in the time of Louis XIV, the mid 17th century. In 18th century France, approximately 90 percent of infants were wet nursed, mostly sent away to live with their wet nurses. In Paris in 1780, only 1000 of the 21,000 babies born that year were nursed by their own mother. The high demand for wet nurses coincided with the low wages and high rent prices of this era, which forced many women to have to work soon after childbirth. This meant that many mothers had to send their infants away to be breastfed and cared for by wet nurses even poorer than themselves. With the high demand for wet nurses, the price to hire one increased as the standard of care decreased. This led to many infant deaths. In response, rather than nursing their own children, upper class women turned to hiring wet nurses to come live with them instead. In entering into their employers home to care for their charges, these wet nurses had to leave their own infants to be nursed and cared for by women far worse off than themselves, and who likely lived at a relatively far distance away. \n\nThe Bureau of Wet Nurses was created in Paris, 1769, to serve two main purposes; it supplied parents with wet nurses, as well as helped lessen the neglect of charges by controlling monthly salary payments to wet nurses. In order to become a wet nurse, women had to meet a few qualifications including a good physical body with a good moral character, they were often judged on their age, their health, the number of children they had, as well as their breast shape, breast size, breast texture, nipple shape and nipple size, since all these aspects were believed to affect the quality of a woman's milk. In 1874, the French government introduced the Roussel Law, which \"mandated that every infant placed with a paid guardian outside the parents’ home be registered with the state so that the French government is able to monitor how many children are placed with wet nurses and how many wet nursed children have died.\"\n\nWet nurses were often hired to work in hospitals so that they could nurse premature babies, babies who were ill or babies who had been abandoned. During the 18th and 19th centuries, congenital syphilis was a common cause of infant mortality in France. The Vaugirard hospital in Paris began to use mercury as a treatment for syphilis, however it could not be safely administered to infants. In 1780, began the process of giving mercury to wet nurses who could then transmit the treatment to the infants with syphilis through their milk in the act of breastfeeding.\n\nThe practice of wetnursing was still widespread during World War I, according to the American Red Cross. Working class women would leave their babies with wetnurses so they could get jobs in factories.\n\nEnglish colonists brought the practice of wet nursing with them to North America. Since the arrangement of sending infants away to live with wet nurses was the cause of so many infant deaths, by the 19th century, Americans adopted the practice of having wet nurses live with the employers in order to nurse and care for their charges. This practice had the effect of increasing the death rate for wet nurses' own babies. Many employers would have only kept a wet nurse for a few months at a time since it was believed that the quality of a woman's breast milk would lessen over time. \n\nSince there were no official records kept pertaining to wet nurses or wet nursed children in the United States, historians lack the knowledge of precisely how many infants were wet-nursed, for how long they were wet-nursed, whether they lived at home or else where while they wet-nursed, as well as how many wet-nursed babies lived or died. The only evidence which exists, pertaining to wet-nursing in the United States is found in the help wanted ads of newspapers, through complaints about wet nurses in magazines, and through medical journals which acted as employment agencies for wet-nurses. \n\nIn the Southern United States, it was common practice for enslaved Black women to be forced to be wet nurses to their owner’s children. In some instances, the enslaved child and the white child would be raised together in their younger years. (Sometimes both babies would be fathered by the same man, the slave-owner; see Children of the plantation.) Visual representations of wet-nursing practices in enslaved communities are most prevalent in representations of the Mammy archetype caricature. Images such as the one in this section represent both a historically accurate practice of enslaved Black women wet-nursing their owner’s white children as well as sometimes an exaggerated racist caricaturization of a stereotype of enslaved Black women as “Mammy” characters.\n\nSometimes the infant is placed in the home of the wetnurse for several months, as was the case for Jane Austen and her siblings. The Papyrus Oxyrhynchus 91, a receipt from 187 Common Era, attests to the ancient nature of this practice. Sometimes the wetnurse came to live with the infant's family, filling a position between the monthly nurse (for the immediate post-partum period) and the nanny.\n\nIn some cultures the wetnurse is simply hired as any other employee. In others, however, she has a special relationship with the family, which may incur kinship rights. In Vietnamese family structure, for example, the wetnurse is known as \"Nhũ mẫu\", \"mẫu\" meaning \"mother\". Islam has a highly codified system of milk kinship known as \"Rada (fiqh).\"\n\nIn contemporary affluent Western societies such as the United States, the act of nursing a baby other than one's own often provokes cultural discomfort. When a mother is unable to nurse her own infant, an acceptable mediated substitute is expressed milk (or especially colostrum) which is donated to milk banks, analogous to blood banks, and processed there by being screened, pasteurized, and usually frozen. Infant formula is also widely available, which its makers claim can be a reliable source of infant nutrition when prepared properly. Dr Rhonda Shaw notes that Western objections to wet-nurses are cultural:\n\nIn addition, the legacy of wet-nursing for African-American women is inherently linked to slavery, and the physical, emotional, and mental abuse that enslaved African-American women endured. While other populations in the United States may be more open to wet-nursing, the cultural attitude within African-American communities towards wet-nursing remains one deeply affected by the generational trauma of wet-nursing during slavery. \n\nFor some Americans, the subject of wet-nursing is becoming increasingly open for discussion. During a UNICEF goodwill trip to Sierra Leone in 2008, Mexican actress Salma Hayek decided to breast-feed a local infant in front of the accompanying film crew. The sick one-week-old baby had been born the same day but a year later than her daughter, who had not yet been weaned. Hayek later discussed on camera an anecdote of her Mexican great-grandmother spontaneously breast-feeding a hungry baby in a village.\n\nWet nurses are still common in many developing countries, although the practice poses a risk of infections such as HIV. In China, Indonesia, and the Philippines, a wet-nurse may be employed in addition to a nanny as a mark of aristocracy, wealth, and high status. Following the 2008 Chinese milk scandal, in which contaminated infant formula poisoned thousands of babies, the salaries of wet-nurses there increased dramatically. The use of a wet-nurse is seen as a status symbol in some parts of modern China.\n\nAdditionally, a woman who wants to postpone pregnancy may wet-nurse and rear a relative (especially a poorer one's) new-born as a \"mancing\" (Javanese language for \"lure\").\n\nRoyal wetnurses are more likely than most to reach the historical record.\n\nIn Ancient Egypt, Maia was the wetnurse of King Tutankhamun. Sitre In, the nurse of Hatshepsut, was not a member of the royal family, but received the honour of a burial in the royal necropolis in the Valley of the Kings in tomb KV60. Her coffin has the inscription \"sdt nfrw nsw in m3‘t ḥrw\", meaning \"Royal Wet Nurse\". Lady Kasuga was the wet nurse of the third Tokugawa shōgun Iemitsu. Lu Lingxuan was a lady in waiting who served as wetnurse to the emperor Gao Wei; she became exceedingly powerful during his reign, and was often criticized by historians for her corruption and treachery. Chinese emperors honoured the Nurse Empress Dowager. Dai Anga was the wetnurse of the Mughal Emperor, Shah Jahan. Shin Myo Myat was the mother of King Bayinnaung of Toungoo Dynasty of Burma (Myanmar), and the wetnurse of King Tabinshwehti. In England, Hodierna of St Albans was the mother of Alexander Neckam and wet nurse of Richard I of England, and Mrs. Pack was a wet nurse to William, Duke of Gloucester (1689–1700).\n\nSome non-royal wetnurses have been written about. Halimah bint Abi Dhuayb was the foster-mother and wetnurse of the Islamic prophet Muhammad. Petronella Muns was, with her employer, the first Western woman to visit Japan. Naomi Baumslag, author of \"Milk, Money and Madness\", described the legendary capacity of Judith Waterford: \"In 1831, on her 81st birthday, she could still produce breast milk. In her prime she unfailingly produced two quarts (four pints or 1.9 litres) of breast milk a day.\"\n\n"}
