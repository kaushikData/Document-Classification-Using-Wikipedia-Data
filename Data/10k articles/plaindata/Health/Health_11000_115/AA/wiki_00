{"id": "3449524", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=3449524", "title": "Ab anbar", "text": "Ab anbar\n\nAn āb anbār (, literally \"water reservoir\") is a traditional reservoir or cistern of drinking water in Greater Iran in antiquity.\n\nTo withstand the pressure the water exerts on the containers of the storage tank, the storage itself was built below ground level. This also provides resistance to earthquakes. Many cities in Iran lie in a region that has been affected by very large earthquakes. Since almost all ab anbars are subterranean structures capped barely above ground level, they inherently possess stable structures.\n\nThe construction material used for ab anbars were very tough and extensively used a special mortar called \"sarooj\" which was made of sand, clay, egg whites, lime, goat hair, and ash in specific proportions, depending on location and climate of the city. This mixture was thought to be completely water impenetrable. The walls of the storage were often 2 meters thick, and special bricks had to be used. These bricks were especially baked for ab anbars and were called \"Ajor Ab anbari\". Some ab anbars were so big that they would be built underneath caravanserais such as the ab anbar of Haj Agha Ali in Kerman. Sometimes they would also be built under mosques, such as the ab anbar of Vazir near Isfahan.\n\nThe bottom of the storage tanks were often filled with metals for various structural reasons. The 18th century monarch Agha Muhammad Khan, is said to have extracted the metals from the bottom of the Ganjali Khan public baths to make bullets for a battle.\n\nSome ab anbars had storage space tanks that were rectangular in design, such as in Qazvin, as opposed to cylindrical designs in Yazd. There were several designs for the arched roof of the storage spaces of each ab anbar, namely \"ahang\", \"kalanbu\", \"kazhāveh\", or combinations of these depending on the features of the storage space.\n\nIn the particular example of Sardar-e Bozorg ab anbar in Qazvin, the storage space was built so large that it became known as the largest single domed ab anbar of Iran. Doming the square plan was not an easy task, yet dome construction was not something new to these architects as is evident from the numerous domed masterpieces such as Soltaniyeh.\n\nSome sources indicate that the architects would first construct the storage space and then fill it up with hay and straw all the way up to where they could start constructing the dome. After finishing the dome, the straw would be set on fire, hence clearing the space inside. However holes can be seen in the walls of many storage spaces where scaffolding perhaps may have been used.\n\nA storage space with a rectangular plan is much harder to dome than a circular one. It is not known why architects in particular places chose rectangular or circular layouts, considering that cylindrical spaces were easier to cover, and were deemed more hygienic for water storage due to lack of any corners in the space. Cylindrical tanks also had the advantage of experiencing homogenous forces throughout the walls caused by earth pressures, as opposed to the rectangular designs. Rectangular plans however have the advantage of containing larger volumes of water within rectangular property limits. Examples of ab anbars with a square plan include the Sardar-e Bozorg ab anbar in Qazvin by Sardar Hosein Qoli Khan Qajar and his brother Hasan Khan Qajar Some required columns to be built inside the storage space. The Sardar e Kuchak ab anbar in Qazvin for example, uses a massive column in the center that splits the space up into four 8.5 X 8.5 meter contiguous spaces, each separately domed. The Zananeh Bazaar ab anbar of Qazvin e.g. uses 4 columns inside its storage tank. The Seyed Esmail ab anbar in Tehran for example, is said to have had 40 columns.\n\nIn order to access the water, one would go through the entrance (\"sar-dar\") which would always be open, traverse a stairway and reach the bottom where there would be faucets to access the water in the storage. Next to the faucet would be a built-in seat or platform, a water drain for disposing water from the faucet, and ventilation shafts. Depending on where (i.e. what depth) the faucets would be, the water would be colder or warmer. Some storages would have multiple faucets located at intervals along the stairway. Thus nobody had direct access to the body of water itself, hence minimizing possible contamination. The storage compartment is completely isolated from the outside except for ventilation shafts or windcatchers. To further minimize contamination, the storage tank’s interior was scattered with a salty compound that would form a surface on top of the water. The storage tank would then be monitored year round to ensure that the surface had not been disturbed. The water of course would be drawn from the bottom using the pasheer.\nIn some ab anbars, such as in Qazvin, the stairway and storage would be constructed adjacently alongside each other, whereas in Yazd the storage and stairway often had no structural connections to each other and the stairway was positioned independently.\n\nThe number of steps would depend on the capacity of the storage. The Sardar-e Bozorg ab anbar, for example, has 50 steps that would take the user to a depth of 17 m below grade. Nabi mosque ab anbar had 36 steps, Haj Kazem 38 steps, Jame’ mosque 35 steps, and Zabideh Khatun with 20 steps (all these are in Qazvin). To provide a brief relief when traversing the steps, there would be one to three landings built midway into the stairway. All stairways are linear.\n\nThe person responsible for filling the ab anbars (both private and public) was someone called a meerab. In effect, he was responsible for distributing the kariz network at various times. If a house wanted its ab anbar filled, they would ask the meerab to open up the kariz to their ab anbar. An overnight appointment would be enough to fill a typical house ab anbar. The ab anbar would also have to be cleaned once a year from settled sediments.\n\nThe Sardar (سردر) is an arched entrance that descends down into the ab anbar. It contains platforms built-in for pedestrians and a resting area after ascending out of the stairway. It is decorated and has inscriptions with poetry and the date of construction.\n\nAb anbars in Iran are known to have used anywhere from one to six windcatchers. Qazvin’s ab anbars however, do not frequently use windcatchers like in other parts of Iran, perhaps because of climatic conditions; Qazvin has very cold winters and mild summers, unlike Yazd. Most of Qazvin’s ab anbars are only equipped with ventilation shafts or semi-windcatchers. Ab anbars in Yazd, Kashan, Naeen, and other hot climate cities of Iran on the other hand extensively use windcatchers for cooling and ventilation purposes.\n\nThe way windcatchers work is that the moving air masses (wind, breeze, etc.) at the top of windcatchers create a pressure gradient between the top of the windcatcher and its base, inside, at the bottom of the shaft. This pressure gradient sucks out rising hot air from inside the shaft while the colder dense air remains. The superb heat-resistant material of the walls of the ab anbar further create an insulating effect that tends to lower the temperature inside an ab anbar, similar to a cave. The ventilating effect of the windcatchers prevent any stagnant air and hence any dew or humidity from forming inside, and the overall effect is pure, clean, cold water all year round.\n\n\n\n\n"}

Sorghum, millet or maize flour are added as a source of wild yeast.\n\nIn Kenya, banana beer is known as \"urwaga\", in RD Congo as Kasiksi, in Uganda as \"mubisi\", in Rwanda and Burundi as \"urwagwa\".\n\nBanana beer is sometimes consumed during rituals and ceremonies. A similar product called \"mwenge\" is made in Uganda with only bananas and sorghum. It can also be found under the names \"kasiksi\", \"nokrars\", \"rwabitoke\", \"urwedensiya\", \"urwarimu\" and \"milinda kaki\".\n\nBanana beer is made from ripe (but not over-ripe) East African Highland bananas (\"Musa acuminata\" (AAA-EA), \"Mbidde\" clone set). To accelerate the ripening of bananas, a hole is dug in the ground, lined with dried banana leaves which are then set on fire. Fresh banana leaves are laid on top of them, and then the unripe bananas. These are then covered by more fresh banana leaves and pseudostems. After four to six days, the bananas are ripe enough. This method only works in the dry season. During the rainy season, bananas are ripened by putting them on a hurdle near a cooking fire.\n\nThere are two types of banana that are used for banana beer: the harsh tasting \"igikashi\" and the milder tasting \"igisahira\". The banana beer mixture consists of one third \"igikashi\" and two thirds \"igisahira\". Once ripened, the bananas are peeled. If they cannot be peeled by hand, they are not ripe enough. After peeling, the bananas are kneaded until soft. The juice is then filtered to get clear banana juice, which is then diluted with water. Sorghum is ground and lightly roasted and then added to the juice. This mixture is left to ferment for 24 hours and then filtered.\n\nAfter filtering, the beer is packaged in glass or plastic bottles. In commercial production, the beer may first be pasteurized before packaging to stop fermentation and extend shelf life.\n\nCommercial brands include:\n\n"}

One of the founders of reproductive justice, Avery has worked to develop healthcare services and education that address Black women's mental and physical health stressors. She is best known as the founder of the National Black Women's Health Project, the first national organization to specialize in Black women's reproductive health issues. For her work with the NBWHP, she has received the MacArthur Foundation's Fellowship for Social Contribution and the Gustav O. Lienhard Award for the Advancement of Health Care from the Institute of Medicine of the National Academy of Science, among other awards.\n\nAvery was born in Waynesville, Georgia and grew up on a farm in DeLand, Florida. She is the daughter of L. Alyce M. Ingram, a schoolteacher. Her mother graduated of Bethune-Cookman College. Her father, Quitman Reddick, owned a neighborhood store. He was killed when Avery was 14 years old. The oldest of three children, Avery assumed a lot of responsibility from a young age.\n\nIn 1995, Avery began studying psychology at Talladega College, where she earned her BA in 1959. She met her husband, Wesley, on her first day there. They married in 1960 and had their first child the following year. They had their second child several years later. \n\nIn 1967, Avery received a fellowship to obtain her master's in special education at the University of Florida. Upon earning her master's degree in 1969, she became a special education teacher. After a few years of teaching, she began to work at the children's mental health unit of her local hospital. Her husband suffered a fatal heart attack months after she began her new job. The death of her husband helped catalyze Avery's commitment to improving health care and health education in the Black community. \n\nAvery met her wife, Ngina Lythcott, in 1989, and the two were married in 2005. Lythcott is a public health practitioner and activist. \n\nIn the early 1970s Avery began participating in consciousness-raising groups and legal abortion referral services. In response to the lack of access to abortion and other reproductive health needs that low-income Black women faced in her community, Avery and her colleagues Joan Edelson, Judy Levy, and Margaret Parrish opened the Gainesville Women's Health Center (GWHC) and Birthplace, a midwifery service birthing center. The GWHC mission statement was to \"help women solve the crisis-producing situation of unplanned, unwanted pregnancy,\" at a low cost. The clinic provided abortions and contraceptive services, facilitated sexuality workshops, and provided other women's health-related training and services tailored to Black women, such as sickle cell anemia testing. To help educate women on best health services, the staff created a monthly newsletter called \"Sage-Femme\".\n\nThese various experiences led Avery to plan the first national conference on black women's health at Spelman college in 1983. Following the conference, she founded the National Black Women's Health Project, now known as the Black Women's Health Imperative, officially in 1984 in Atlanta, Georgia. It is the only national organization exclusively dedicated to improving health and wellness among Black women. \nAvery produced \"On Becoming a Woman: Mothers and Daughters Talking to Each Other\" (1987), the first documentary film by African-American women sharing their perspectives on menstruation, sex, and love. \n\nIn 1990, Avery, along with 15 other African-American women and men, formed the African-American Women for Reproductive Freedom. The organization was created to end the stigma against abortions in the Black community and to make abortions more accessible for Black women.\n\nAvery has written and lectured widely on how race, class and sex impact women's healthcare. She has been a visiting fellow at the Harvard University School of Public Health; she has served on the Charter Advisory Committee for the Office of Research on Women's Health of the National Institutes of Health; she has been a health issues advisor for the Kellogg Foundation's International Leadership Program; and she has served as a consultant on women's healthcare in Latin America, the Caribbean and Africa.\n\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2039116", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2039116", "title": "Chaoulli v Quebec (AG)", "text": "Chaoulli v Quebec (AG)\n\nChaoulli v Quebec (AG) [2005] 1 S.C.R. 791, ,\nwas a decision by the Supreme Court of Canada of which the Court ruled that the \"Quebec Health Insurance Act\" and the \"Hospital Insurance Act\" prohibiting private medical insurance in the face of long wait times violated the \"Quebec Charter of Human Rights and Freedoms\". In a 4 to 3 decision, the Court found the Acts violated Quebecers' right to life and security of person under the Quebec Charter. The ruling is binding only in Quebec. Three of the seven judges also found that the laws violated section seven of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms. One judge did not rule on the Canadian Charter. The result was a 3–3 tie on the question of the Canadian Charter, so Chaoulli decision does not apply to any other province. \n\nHaving suffered in the past from numerous health problems including a hip replacement, 73-year-old salesman George Zeliotis became an advocate for reducing waiting times for patients in Quebec hospitals.\n\nJacques Chaoulli is a doctor who provided home appointments to patients. He attempted to get a licence to offer his services as an independent private hospital but was rejected due to provincial legislation prohibiting private health insurance.\n\nTogether, the two men sought a declaratory judgment to contest the prohibition.\n\nThree separate opinions were written. The first is by Deschamps who found a violation of the Quebec Charter, but stated there was no necessity for her to rule on the Canadian Charter . A second opinion was written by McLachlin C.J. and Major J., with Bastarache J. concurring, on the violation of section seven. A dissenting opinion was given by Binnie and LeBel JJ. with Fish J. concurring in dissent.\n\nDeschamps begins by identifying the issue as being whether the prohibition is \"justified by the need to preserve the integrity of the public system\" and not questioning the single-tier health system itself. In examining the legislative context of the case, she warns against politicizing the issue and against taking an emotional tone to the judgment.\n\nThe appeal court's characterization of the issue as an infringement of an economic right is rejected by Deschamps. She goes on to note that the long waits at hospitals can result in deaths and that private health care prohibited by the Quebec Acts would likely have saved those lives. The wait lists, she claims, are an implicit form of rationing, and it is the government's rationing policy that is being challenged here as a violation of the right to \"security of person\" (\"per\" Canadian Charter) and \"personal inviolability\" (\"per\" Quebec Charter).\n\nDeschamps sides with the trial judge, who found a violation of section 7 of the Canadian Charter, but she interprets it as being more of a violation of the similar section 1 of the Quebec Charter. She adopts a broad interpretation, citing \"R. v. Morgentaler\" among others as examples of delay in medical treatment as a violation of security of person. She further rejects the dissenters' suggestion that a patient could seek medical treatment outside of the province as too extreme and case-specific.\n\nTurning to the requisite analysis to justify the violation, Deschamps points to the \"minimal impairment\" expectation to be the one of the most interest. Expert and witness testimony was examined of which she found it to be not particularly credible or useful. She then examines other provinces' health legislation, finding the lack of prohibitory legislation allows her to conclude that the Quebec Acts are not necessary to preserve the public health plan. Studies on public health programs in other countries examined by Deschamps support this claim.\n\nThe issue of deference to government is considered. \"When the courts are given the tools they need to make a decision, they should not hesitate to assume their responsibilities,\" she states, claiming that social policies developed by the government should not be shied away from by the courts. Deference should be given only with a justification consistent with democratic values and sufficiently necessary to maintain public order.\n\nIn concluding, Deschamp points her finger squarely at the government and suggests the need for change:\n\nBoth McLachlin and Major agree with Deschamp's reasoning but rely more on section 7 and section 1 of the Canadian Charter to reach the same outcome. They observe that the \"Charter does not confer a freestanding constitutional right to health care. However, where the government puts in place a scheme to provide health care, that scheme must comply with the Charter.\" \n\nTo determine a violation of the Charter, they look at how the Quebec Acts differ from the \"Canada Health Act\"'. They note that unlike with other legislation, the impugned Acts remove the ability to contract for private health care insurance and in effect create a virtual monopoly for the public health system. On the evidence of significant delays in service, this monopoly harms the right to security of person. Delays in medical treatment could have physical and stressful consequences.\n\nIn reviewing the public health care systems of several countries they find that the connection was missing. In defence of this, they criticize the dissenters' rejection of international data as well and reliance on what they characterized as inconsistent reports from Romanow and Senator Kirby.\n\nThey begin by phrasing the question as being not one of rationing, but rather\n\nThey then describe the problem as an issue of public policy and social values which is not for the courts to decide.\nThe characterization of the problem by the majority contains too much ambiguity, they claim. How can the court determine what is a \"reasonable\" wait time, they ask?\n\nBinnie and LeBel primarily take issue with the majority's claim that the law is arbitrary contrary to the principles of fundamental justice.\n\nThe dissenters' interpretation of the legislation finds a rational connection to the objectives of the Canadian Health Act:\n\nThey admit agreeing with the majority and the trial judge that the law will put \"some\" Quebecers life and \"security of person\" at risk, but they do not see the matter being resolved by or applicable to the constitution. They state that \"it will likely be a rare case where s. 7 will apply in circumstances entirely unrelated to adjudicative or administrative proceedings.\" However, they claim, this is not one of those times. Instead, they lament the overextension of the constitution:\nIn effect, the dissenters say, the Court is only protecting the right to contract and pushing Canada into its own Lochner era, while dismissing those that claimed privatizing will not necessarily solve the problem.\n\nThey characterize the majority's use of the word \"arbitrary\" as meaning \"unnecessary,\" claiming that if that were true, it would require the courts to interfere too much with lawmakers.\n\nThe dissenters' final objection is the majority's expansion of the reasoning in \"R. v. Morgentaler\". Binnie and LeBel distinguish \"R. v. Morgentaler\" from the current case, as the former was about \"manifest unfairness\" and criminal liability, not arbitrariness and public health policy, which, they claim, requires a very different analytical approach.\n\nThe decision proved to be highly contentious by its political nature and its conflict with the present government's policy on health. There are those, who argue that this decision could potentially lead to the dismantling of the Canadian Medicare system, while others suggest that this could be a much-needed wake-up call to repair the ailing system.\n\nThis ruling could have a direct effect on most provinces that currently have laws that are designed to discourage the private sector, in particular Ontario, Manitoba, British Columbia, Alberta, and Prince Edward Island, which all have legislation very similar to the impugned laws in Quebec.\n\nAfter the Supreme Court rendered its judgment, the Attorney General of Quebec asked the Court to stay (suspend) its judgment for 18 months. The Court granted the stay for only 12 months; it therefore expired on June 8, 2006.\n\nIn August 2005, delegates to the Canadian Medical Association adopted a motion supporting access to private-sector health services and private medical insurance in circumstances where patients cannot obtain timely access to care through the single-payer health care system.\n\nIn November 2005, a Quebec provincial white paper on limited private reforms was leaked to the media. The paper proposed allowing the purchase of private medical insurance. To prevent doctors from abandoning the public system, the paper would force doctors to perform a minimum amount of work in the public sector before they would be allowed to perform in the private sector.\n\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "37666849", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=37666849", "title": "Death of Savita Halappanavar", "text": "Death of Savita Halappanavar\n\nSavita Halappanavar was a 31-year-old Indian dentist who died on 28 October 2012 at University Hospital Galway in Ireland due to the complications of a septic miscarriage at 17 weeks' gestation. The miscarriage took seven days to unfold, and early in the process, when it was clear that the miscarriage was inevitable, Halappanavar requested an abortion. At that time the medical team had not diagnosed her with a blood infection, and her request was denied because the medical team did not judge that her life was in danger. The medical team eventually did diagnose the sepsis and began trying to treat it, and when they determined that Halappanavar's life was in danger they had planned to administer misoprostol to induce delivery, but the miscarriage completed before they were able to. The sepsis continued developing and she died of cardiac arrest caused by the sepsis. Her death caused controversy at the time, nationally and internationally, leading to protests and marches.\n\nAfter her death, a Coroner's Inquest was held, finding that she died of medical misadventure. The HSE and HIQA conducted an investigation. Both criticized the team for not diagnosing the sepsis soon enough and for not using already-standard screening tools for detecting and managing maternal sepsis, and for poor keeping of medical records, poor communication at shift changes, and failure to notify staff with needed expertise, and criticized the administration of the hospital for the poor system in which the team failed. They made recommendations about training and policies for the hospital locally along with a number of national recommendations, including the creation of a laboratory system to coordinate a national response to emerging microbial threats. The HSE also recommended changes to the legal situation and training of doctors about the law.\n\nThe law in force at the time (the Offences against the Person Act 1861), stated that the act of abortion, where there was no immediate physiological threat to the woman's life to continue the pregnancy, was a criminal offence punishable by life imprisonment. Following a ruling of the Supreme Court of Ireland in 1992—now known in Ireland as the X case—terminations are allowed under certain circumstances, where \"a pregnant woman's life is at risk because of pregnancy, including the risk of suicide\". However at the time of Halappanavar's death, there was legal uncertainty regarding the precise circumstances in which this exception to preserve the life of the mother would apply in practice, as the matter had not yet been enacted in legislation. The Protection of Life During Pregnancy Act 2013 was passed as a result of her death.\n\nSavita Halappanavar, 17 weeks pregnant with her first baby, went to the hospital with her husband Praveen on 21 October 2012 complaining about back pain. She was examined and discharged, and then returned to the hospital a few hours later after she felt something \"coming down.\" An examination showed that the gestational sac had protruded into her vagina, almost to the opening. She was admitted to the hospital for observation, as a miscarriage appeared to be inevitable. Her water broke just after midnight on 22 October. On the 23 the Halappanavars discussed terminating the pregnancy early with one of the consultant doctors: according to the 2013 Health Service report: \"O&G Consultant 1 stated that the patient and her husband were advised of Irish law in relation to this. At interview the consultant stated 'Under Irish law, if there’s no evidence of risk to the life of the mother, our hands are tied so long as there’s a fetal heart'. The consultant stated that if risk to the mother was to increase a termination would have been possible, but that it would be based on actual risk and not a theoretical risk of infection 'we can’t predict who is going to get an infection'\". Midwife manager Ann Maria Burke attempted to calm the couple and explained that the termination cannot be carried out because Ireland is \"a Catholic country\". Halappanavar began to develop signs of sepsis, and the hospital decided to insert a central line to better manage her condition, and had also decided to administer misoprostol to induce delivery; the medication was not given because on 24 October she delivered a stillborn female child in the procedure room where the central line was being inserted. The sepsis continued to worsen, and at 1:09am, on Sunday 28 October, she died from cardiac arrest caused by the sepsis.\n\nOn 3 November 2012, friends and family of the Halappanavars contacted local pro-choice groups (Galway Pro-Choice) to find out what they could do, with dozens of her friends and family meeting in person on the 6th. Galway Pro-Choice put them in contact with \"The Irish Times\" journalist Kitty Holland, on 7 November. Pro-choice groups then organised on the Irish Choice Network (ICN) email group before the story broke.\n\nHalappanavar's death became public after the \"Tonight with Vincent Browne\" programme showed front-page stories by \"The Irish Times\" and the \"Irish Independent\" newspapers on 13 November 2012. This resulted in the news being disseminated on Twitter, including tweets by journalists Caitlin Moran and India Knight, and coverage by publications such as BBC News, the British edition of \"The Huffington Post\", \"The Guardian\", \"The Daily Telegraph\", \"Daily Mirror\", and \"The Independent\" newspapers.\n\nOn 14 November 2012, more than 2,000 people gathered in her memory and to protest Ireland's abortion laws outside the Dáil in Dublin. In addition, a candle-light vigil was held in Cork. The government's expert committee in abortion, to address the \"A, B and C v Ireland\" judgement, handed in its report to the Department of Health the evening before the new story broke.\n\nHalappanavar's death led to protests in Galway, particularly from the local Indian expatriate community. On 14 November \"The Daily Mirror\" reported that the University Hospital was the subject of several investigations. Halappanavar had been one of the organisers of the annual Galway Diwali festival, which was cancelled in response to her death.\n\nThere were calls upon the Taoiseach to secure an external enquiry into the circumstances surrounding Halappanavar's death. There were also calls for a change in the law, as the legislation at the time was an Act of the British Parliament of 1861—when Ireland was still part of the United Kingdom —which declared that it was unlawful to \"procure a miscarriage\". On 16 November, the Irish Health Service Executive established an independent inquiry into the circumstances surrounding Halappanavar's death.\n\nOn Saturday 17 November, the Garda Síochána (Ireland's national police) estimated that between ten and twelve thousand protesters marched from Parnell Square to Merrion Square to demand a change in the law, whilst other rallies were also held across Ireland and in many other countries abroad. On the same day, the Gardaí announced that they were assisting the coroner in the investigation into the death of Halappanavar. Medical terminations had previously been performed at the University Hospital when complications arose in pregnancy, as it is permitted by Irish law to save the life of the woman. In an opinion piece in the \"Daily Mail\", Paul Bracchi speculated that an investigation would be carried out into why this did not occur in Halappanavar's case.\n\nOn Monday, 19 November, the Roman Catholic Bishops of Ireland met in response to Halappanavar's death and released a statement that the Catholic Church believes in the \"equal and inalienable right to life of a mother and her unborn child\" and that the Church has never taught that the life of an unborn child takes precedence over the mother.\n\nEilis O'Hanlon stated that in its initial coverage, \"The Irish Times\" had \"opted to present what had happened as a simple morality tale\" and that \"the debate for the rest of the week was coloured entirely by The Irish Times's decision to reduce a complex personal tragedy, about which few facts were still known, to a rallying call.\" An analysis in \"The Irish Times\" on 17 November stated: \"There is much we do not know about the medical care Savita Halappanavar received\" and \"even before the full facts are established Ms Halappanavar’s tragedy has generated much national and international coverage\" in both traditional and social media of which much has been \"careful and sympathetic\" but \"much ... has been intemperate, intolerant and politicised.\"\n\nThe staff of University Hospital, as well as members of Ireland's Health Services Executive (HSE) Regional Health Forum stated that there is no \"Catholic ethos\" that is impacting treatment provided.\n\nDr Sam Coulter-Smith, a consultant in obstetrics and gynaecology and a university master in the Rotunda Hospital, one of the largest maternity hospitals in Ireland, said that it would be preferable to introduce legislation to bring in clarity, saying, \"We really do need legislation in this area, otherwise we're going to be at risk of doctors working outside the law, and that's not appropriate.\" Dr Rhona Mahony, Master of the National Maternity Hospital, said: \"It is very disappointing that, 20 years after the 'X-Case', we don't have legislation\" and that women \"need to know that they are going to get the appropriate health care that they need\" while doctors \"need to know that they are also protected in their ability to do their job.\" Peter Boylan, of the Irish Institute of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, said: \"The current situation is like a sword of Damocles hanging over us. If we do something with a good intention, but it turns out to be illegal, the consequences are extremely serious for medical practitioners.\"\n\nMicrobiologist Dr. James Clair stated that the \"main problem is being missed\" in the case, suggesting that the real issue may be that the septicemia was caused by extended-spectrum beta-lactamase positive gram negative bacteria (ESBL), which \"are now spreading rapidly within the Irish population\" and are resistant to many known antibiotic treatments.\n\nA week after the story broke, while the investigations were still ongoing, Taoiseach Enda Kenny stated: \"I don't think we should say anything about this until we are in possession of all the facts.\"\n\nPrior to publication of the reports, the Minister for Health, James Reilly, said that the public must not pre-judge the situation and further said that he was awaiting the results of the investigations, adding he had no evidence to suggest a so-called \"Catholic ethos\" at the University Hospital that prevented Halappanavar's life from being saved by a medical termination. He has also stated that an inquiry into Halappanavar's death must stand up to international scrutiny.\n\nBrian Walsh, a Fine Gael TD for Galway West, said that Galway University Hospital had carried out terminations in recent years in accordance with the judgement by the Supreme Court in the X case and with the guidelines of the Irish Medical Council. He said that the University Hospital was not run or managed by any [Catholic] religious orders and did not have a so-called \"Catholic ethos\".\n\nFianna Fáil leader Micheál Martin said that Halappanavar's death was tragic and harrowing. Martin said that Ireland had always aimed for a low death rate during pregnancy but that this was \"cold comfort\" to Halappanavar and her surviving family and relatives. He said that an independent inquiry was needed, with experts from outside the country to establish the full circumstances. He also responded on 17 November, saying that \"legislating for the X case would not have stopped [the death of Savita Halappanavar]\". On 18 December 2012, after a panel of experts submitted its report to the Parliament recommending, \"the government legislate the issue in order to clarify what the current laws actually do and do not permit\", Ireland's then Minister of Health, James Reilly, stated \"We will clarify in legislation and regulation what is available by way of treatment to a woman when a pregnancy gives rise to a threat to a woman’s life.\"\n\nPro-choice campaigners highlighted at the time that the lack of legislation clarifying the limited circumstances in which abortion is legal in Ireland contributed to Halappanavar's death. Several rallies and vigils were organised nationwide, calling for the Irish government to legislate in relation to abortion on the basis of the \"Attorney General v. X\". Campaigners argued that legislation remained outstanding at the time of Halappanavar's death despite the European Court of Human Rights having instructed the state to clarify its laws on abortion after finding in \"A, B and C v Ireland\" (2010) that the Republic of Ireland had violated the Convention by failing to provide an accessible and effective procedure by which a woman can have established whether she qualifies for a legal abortion under current Irish law.\n\nIrish Choice Network allegedly emailed members, calling for an emergency meeting to discuss how to proceed with this \"major news story\".\n\nIn response to critics accusing pro-choice activists of exploiting Halappanavar's death, Kate Smurthwaite responded in a column in \"The Huffington Post\" titled \"Yes, Savita Halappanavar's Death IS a Political Issue\" in which she stated, \"If I am ever a victim of an unjust legal discrepancy that infringes my human rights and leads to my untimely and unnecessary agonising death I want every man, woman and child on the streets immediately demanding that it never, ever be allowed to happen again.\"\n\nThe Life Institute in Ireland has accused what it called \"abortion campaigners\" of exploiting Halappanavar's death to further the pro-choice agenda.\n\nMichael Kelly of \"The Catholic World Report\" rejects claims that Ireland's abortion laws led to Halappanavar's death, writing that \"medical experts and bioethicists have been quick to express their view that Ireland's ban on abortion had nothing to do with Mrs. Halappanavar’s death. They insist that guidelines from the Irish Medical Council are perfectly clear that pregnant women must be given all necessary medical treatment.\" Father Shenan J. Boquet, president of Human Life International, said that there was no evidence to indicate that \"a Catholic ethos\" prevented responsible treatment of the mother, and called news reports that that was the case \"demonizing the church's position on abortion\". He described the debate resulting from the event as \"activism masquerading as compassion and moral outrage.\"\n\nThere were protests outside the Irish embassies in London, Berlin and Brussels.\n\nIn India, the then-Indian Minister for External Affairs, Salman Khurshid, summoned the Indian ambassador to Ireland, Debashish Chakravarti, to India for deliberations over the issue. Chakravarti later met Eamon Gilmore, Ireland's Tánaiste (deputy prime minister) and foreign minister, and promised to keep Halappanavar's husband up to date with the government's response. Rajeev Chandrasekhar, an independent member of the Rajya Sabha (the upper house of the Parliament of India) said, \"The death of Savita Halappanavar should be pursued by family and Govt. of India as a case of human rights violation and murder. Instead of simply protesting, cases should be filed against the Govt. of Ireland and its leadership at the International Court of justice and United Nations Commission for Human Rights (UNHCR). This should move beyond protesting to where people are brought to account!\"\n\nIn an editorial on 17 November 2012, \"The Times of India\" said, \"There appears to be a tendency to view this issue in terms of India versus Ireland or the Catholic faith against other religions. To fall prey to such tendencies would be a serious mistake and a great disservice to the memory of Savita. ... Adding a nationalist or communal tone to the debate detracts from the merit of argument rather than enhancing it.\"\n\nAmnesty International states that Halappanavar's death \"illustrates [the] gap in Irish law\" and asked the government of Ireland to change the law on abortion \"in line with international human rights laws.\" The executive director of Amnesty International in Ireland, Colm O'Gorman, said that \"successive Irish Governments have failed in their duty to provide necessary clarity on how this right is protected and vindicated, leaving women in Ireland in a very vulnerable position.\"\n\nOn 19 November 2012, the HSE named Professor Sir Sabaratnam Arulkumaran to head a seven-member panel looking into the case. Arulkumaran is the head of obstetrics and gynaecology at St George's Hospital Medical School and is president-elect of the International Federation of Gynaecology and Obstetrics. The panel sought to uncover all the facts and \"to identify any safety issues arising in this case\".\n\nOn 20 November 2012, three members of the panel were asked to step down when Savita Halappanavar's husband, Praveen Halappanavar, indicated that he would not cooperate with the panel due to their connections as consultants to University Hospital. Arulkumaran has requested a meeting with Mr. Halappanavar. On 21 November, the \"Irish Independent\" reported that Arulkumaran was being accused of being \"pro-abortion\" and promoting a \"liberal\" approach to abortion because of papers that he has published.\n\nThe Arulkumaran report was published on 13 June 2013. It identified three \"Key Causal Factors\" for the death: inadequate assessment and monitoring; failure to offer all management options to a patient; and non adherence to clinical guidelines related to the prompt and effective management of sepsis. It made six recommendations for improvements in patient care in such situations. Most recommendations called for improvements in healthcare guideline, training and practices, and one recommendation called for legislative changes if necessary to allow for expediting delivery for clinical purposes. Additionally, it made three recommendations to address incidental factors.\n\nThe report indicates the first key causal factor was inadequate assessment and monitoring. This would have allowed medical staff to recognise and respond to indicators that the infection was causing a deterioration in Savita's condition. Additionally, staff failed to devise a plan of care recognising that (1) the infection was the most likely cause of the patient's miscarriage, and, (2.) With increase in time following admission, and the rupture of the patient's membranes, the risk of infection and sepsis increases.\n\nThe panel identified the hospital's failure to offer all management options to a patient was a second key causal factor. The panel points out that the patient was \"experiencing inevitable miscarriage of an early second trimester pregnancy where the risk to the mother increased with time from the time that membranes were ruptured.\"\n\nThe panel found that hospital staff failed to adhere to clinical guidelines which relate to severe sepsis and septic shock. These relate to timely and effective management of sepsis when it is diagnosed.\n\nIn reviewing the care given to Halappanavar in light of clinical guidelines, the panel wrote: \nRupture of membranes may be caused by infection and vomiting indicates that the patient was unwell increasing the possibility of infection becoming systemic to causing sepsis. At\ninterview, clinicians indicated that their management decisions were guided by the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists Green-top guidelines for the Management of Preterm Pre-labour Rupture of the Membranes (RCOG Green-top Guideline No.44 2006 amended 2010). The patient was commenced on erythromycin at 22.00hrs on the 22nd of October. Erythromycin is indicated for use prophylactically in preterm pre-labour rupture of the membranes in the absence of signs such as a faster pulse or lower blood pressure or raised temperature (Green-top Guidelines No 44 (2006 with amendment Oct 2010)). Erythromycin has also been shown to delay delivery which is beneficial in the management of preterm pre-labour rupture of the membranes but not in cases of inevitable miscarriage.However, in cases of preterm pre-labour rupture of the membranes where signs of sepsis occur, best practice guidelines promote that delivery is expedited.\nThe appropriate management of spontaneous rupture of the membranes in cases of inevitable miscarriage where infection is a possible underlying cause is somewhat different to the appropriate management of Preterm Pre-labour Rupture of the Membranes where the incidence of infection at presentation is lower and the survival of the fetus is more likely.There are no accepted clear local, national or international guidelines on the management of inevitable early second trimester miscarriage (i.e. less than 24 weeks) including the management of miscarriage where there is prolonged rupture of the membranes. The reason for the absence of such guidelines may be that clinical practice in other jurisdictions would have led to an early termination of pregnancy in equivalent clinical circumstances. It is recommended that such guidelines be developed for such patients as a matter of urgency and they should be explicit in the guidance given as to when one should offer termination based on symptoms and signs of infection implying increasing health risk to the mother which may even threaten her life.We recognise that such guidelines must be consistent with applicable law and that the guidance so urged may require legal change.\n\n\nIn 2017, Arulkumaran commented that a significant contributing factor to her death was Ireland's restrictive abortion laws.\n\nThe Health Information and Quality Authority (HIQA) published a report into the incident on 9 October 2013. It found \"following the rupture of her membranes, four-hourly observations including temperature, heart rate, respiration and blood pressure did not appear to have been carried out at the required intervals\", noting \"that though UHG [University Hospital Galway] had a guideline in place for the management of suspected sepsis and sepsis in obstetric care, the clinical governance arrangements were “not robust enough to ensure adherence to this guideline\".\n\nPartly in response to the protest movement after the death of Savita Halappanavar, the Irish government introduced the \"Protection of Life During Pregnancy Act 2013\". Having passed both Houses of the Oireachtas in July 2013, it was signed into law on 30 July by Michael D. Higgins, the President of Ireland.\n\nOn 20 September 2013, Praveen Halappanavar's solicitor served legal proceedings against Galway University Hospital and separately against Doctor Katherine Astbury. The proceedings claim that Halappanavar's constitutional right to life had been breached and allege 30 issues of medical negligence.\n\nBy May 2014, Praveen Halappanavar had emigrated to the United States. On 10 March 2016, Praveen Halappanavar settled the case with the HSE, after the HSE agreed to a confidential, six-figure cash settlement.\n\nThe issue of abortion law in Ireland continued to be an issue for political debate. In 2016-17 the Irish government convened a Citizens' Assembly to advise about the Eighth Amendment.\n\nOn 20 May 2018, the parents of Halappanavar called for a Yes vote in Ireland's referendum on the repeal of the Eighth Amendment with her father saying, \"I hope the people of Ireland will vote yes for abortion, for the ladies of Ireland and the people of Ireland. My daughter, she lost her life because of this abortion law, because of the diagnosis, and she could not have an abortion. She died.\" On 25 of May 2018, the people of Ireland voted Yes to repeal the Eighth Amendment by a margin of 2 to 1.\n\nOn September 30, 2018, an open letter by Emma Watson to Halappanavar was published in \"Porter\" magazine.\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "30074251", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=30074251", "title": "Emotional well-being", "text": "Emotional well-being\n\nThe implications of decreased emotional well-being are related to mental health concerns such as stress, depression, and anxiety. These in turn can contribute to physical ill-health such as digestive disorders, sleep disturbances, and general lack of energy. The profile of a person prone to emotional distress is usually someone with low self-esteem, pessimistic, emotionally sensitive, very self-critical…, people who need to constantly assert themselves through their behavior. They also tend to be afraid, overly worried about the future, and focused on the past. As Dr. Marisa Navarro says in her book La Medicina Emocional (Emotional Medicine), \"no one is safe from suffering this emotional state. It is a very serious problem that can result in constant states of anger, sadness, worry and even anxiety or depression\".\n\nOn the positive side, enhanced emotional well-being is seen to contribute to upward spirals in increasing coping ability, self-esteem, performance and productivity at work, and even longevity. Thoughts determine our feelings, and thoughts are nothing more than firings of neurons. And those feelings that our thoughts generate make our body release extremely addicting substances like adrenaline and cortisol. Like with any other addiction, the need to continually feed off these addicting substances tends to make the body think and feel in a certain way. When someone decides to disengage from these emotional addictions, they have to learn to think differently.\n\nThe connection between the mind and the body is so strong that mental and physical states feed into each other in both a positive and negative way. Feelings depend on thoughts and both determine attitudes and actions. This is the first thing that children would have to learn at a young age in order to learn that they can take the reins of their lives. And their feelings would not depend on what is happening around them, but rather their interpretation about what is happening.\n\nEmotional well-being is also one of two aspects of personal well-being that can be measured in quantitative quality of life assessments, the other being 'life evaluation', the evaluation of one's life in general against a scale. It is a term receiving attention from many groups, from new-age therapists to management consultants, from outdoor recreation enthusiasts to carers for the elderly. It is also of interest to many parents, youth workers, school teachers, anti-bullying campaigners and those thinking about retirement, as well as to psychologists and other health professionals.\n\nGood emotional health leads to better physical health, prevents diseases, and makes it possible to enjoy life and be happier. In this way one can become a \"medicine person\" through mirror neurons, those that lead to empathy and fire to imitate the emotions of others. Mirror neurons are what make people feel good when they are with someone who is positive, cheerful and motivational. At the other extreme are the so-called \"toxic people\", who make others around them feel bad.\n\nThe Surgeon General of the United States has made emotional well-being one of his priorities and spoke about its importance at the Aspen Ideas Festival 2016.\n\nPhysicians must take a holistic approach to patients by caring for physical, psychological, and social health. To that end, they need to become aware of the importance of emotional medicine in order to help their patients decrease and manage negative feelings that can damage their health and teach them to enhance the positive feelings that can prevent and help heal illness.\n\n"}
{"id": "1147073", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1147073", "title": "Eugene Landy", "text": "Eugene Landy\n\nEugene Ellsworth Landy (November 26, 1934 – March 22, 2006) was an American psychologist and psychotherapist best known for his unconventional 24-hour therapy, and especially for his treatment of the Beach Boys co-founder Brian Wilson in the 1970s and 1980s, which was deemed unethical by Californian courts. His treatment of Wilson was dramatized in the 2014 biographical film \"Love & Mercy\", in which Landy is portrayed by Paul Giamatti.\n\nAs a teenager, Landy aspired to show business, briefly serving as an early manager for George Benson. During the 1960s, he began studying psychology, earning his doctorate at the University of Oklahoma. After moving to Los Angeles, he treated many celebrity clients, including musician Alice Cooper and actors Richard Harris, Rod Steiger, Maureen McCormick, and Gig Young. He also developed an unorthodox 24-hour therapy intended to stabilize his patients by micromanaging their lives with a team of counselors and doctors.\n\nBrian Wilson initially became a patient under Landy's program in 1975. Landy was soon discharged due to his burdensome fees. In 1983, Landy was re-employed as Wilson's therapist, subsequently becoming his executive producer, business manager, co-songwriter, and business adviser. Landy went on to co-produce Wilson's debut solo album \"Brian Wilson\" (1988) and its unreleased follow-up \"Sweet Insanity\" (1991), as well as allegedly ghostwrote portions of Wilson's disowned memoir \"\" (1991).\n\nIn 1989, Landy agreed to let the state of California revoke his professional license amidst accusations of ethical violations and patient misconduct. Wilson continued to see Landy until a 1992 restraining order barred Landy from contacting the musician ever again. After the 1990s, Landy continued a psychotherapy practice with licensure in New Mexico and Hawaii until his death.\n\nEugene Ellsworth Landy was born on November 26, 1934, in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, the only child of Jules C. Landy, a medical doctor and psychology professor, and Frieda Mae Gordon Landy, also a psychology professor. Eugene dropped out of school in the sixth grade, later claiming to be dyslexic. At age 16, he pursued a career in show business, producing a nationally syndicated radio show, and discovering 10-year-old George Benson. Landy briefly served as Benson's manager and worked odd jobs as a radio producer, promoting records and producing a single for Frankie Avalon.\n\nHonoring his parents' wishes, Landy resumed his psychiatric studies at Los Angeles City College, where he earned an AA in chemistry, and entered medical school at the National University of Mexico. After falling ill with dysentery, he switched to psychology. He earned a master's degree in psychology from the University of Oklahoma in 1967, completing his training with a PhD in 1968.\n\nAfter completing his studies, Landy worked for the Peace Corps, eventually moving to Los Angeles to work as a drug counselor at Harbor Hospital and as a popular part-time instructor at San Fernando Valley State College. Landy began developing ideas for his 24-hour treatment program while engaging in postdoctoral work at Rancho Santa Fe. It was there that he practiced \"marathon therapy\", in which a therapist takes control of a group of people for a day or more. In 1968, he worked briefly as an intern at Gateways Hospital in Echo Park, Los Angeles, where he developed his methods further, experimenting with treatment on teenage drug abusers with varying degrees of success. He attributed his failures to having too little control over their nighttime activities; he tried evening rap groups and made himself available at all hours for talking therapies for their nocturnal anxiety attacks. Landy went on to call his new system milieu therapy.\nWhile serving the hospital, Landy became cultured in the lingo used by its teenagers. In 1971, he authored a book on hippie jargon called \"The Underground Dictionary\", published by Simon & Schuster.\n\nAround 1972, Landy founded a Beverly Hills clinic, the Foundation for the Rechanneling of Emotions and Education (FREE). Interns employed at the clinic used Landy's approach on a partial basis. In the early 1970s, he also started penetrating Hollywood social circles, becoming a consultant on various television shows including \"The Bob Newhart Show\". He soon began treating many celebrity clients, earning $200 an hour.\n\nSome of Landy's patients included Alice Cooper, Richard Harris, Rod Steiger, and Gig Young, who died in an apparent murder-suicide along with his wife in 1978. In a 1976 interview with \"Rolling Stone\", Landy claimed that he had treated others, but that he was in no position to explain his background. He added, \"I've treated a tremendous number of people in show business; for some reason I seem to be able to relate to them. I think I have a nice reputation that says I'm unorthodox by orthodox standards but basically unique by unorthodox standards.\" Unusually, he had his own press kit. Doctor and former colleague Sol Samuels described Landy as \"a maverick in the field of psychology. He's done things that no other psychologist has done in treating the psychotic and the drug addict. ... What he was doing really was translating the hospital environment to the home environment. I think he got some remarkable results – with people who can afford it.\"\n\nLandy was initially hired to treat Brian Wilson by Wilson's wife Marilyn in 1975. Wilson publicly rebelled against the program, saying that the only reason that he went along with it was so that he would not be committed to a psychiatric facility. Beach Boys road manager Rick Nelson later claimed that Landy had attempted to exert unwelcome artistic control over the group. During the recording of the Beach Boys' album \"15 Big Ones\" (1976), group meetings were supervised by Landy, and discussions over each song for the record were reported to last for up to eight hours. Another report suggested that Landy had asked for a percentage of the band's income. At the command of Landy, Wilson appeared on \"Saturday Night Live\", choosing to perform a solo piano rendition of \"Good Vibrations\" which received mixed feedback. Landy stood off-camera holding signs for Wilson that read \"smile\". He said that critics missed the point of this exercise, explaining that Wilson's performance \"was a terrible thing\" as a one-shot, but if he continued making appearances, then he would have gradually overcome his stage fright.\n\nSteve Love, Wilson's cousin and band manager, fired Landy in December 1976 when Landy doubled his fee. Landy remembered \"15 Big Ones\" as \"the only major success\" the Beach Boys had in recent years; \"Brian and I did that together. Right after that, I had to leave the situation. ... I was interested in making Brian a whole human being; they [the Beach Boys management] were interested in getting another album done in time for 1977.\" In 1977, Wilson was asked if Landy had too much control; he said, \"I thought so, but there was nothing I could do about it and I eventually gave in to it. ... [He had] control of my life legally through the commitment of my wife. ... He definitely helped me. It cost over a hundred thousand dollars – he charged a hell of a lot per month.\" Wilson then reported that Landy was replaced with a new doctor, Steve Schwartz. Schwartz died in a camping accident sometime after.\n\nFive years later in 1982, Wilson was brought back to Landy's care after overdosing on a combination of alcohol, cocaine, and other psychoactive drugs. Landy monitored Wilson's drug intake and used Sol Samuels to prescribe him medication. His assistant Kevin Leslie stood with Wilson at every moment, earning Leslie the nickname \"Surf Nazi\". Leslie also gave Wilson medication at Landy's direction. Initially, Leslie was paid salary by Landy, but was eventually paid directly by Wilson. In 1988, Samuels took credit with performing the \"actual supervision of the therapy ... giving the medication and the occasional psychotherapy as he needs it. What Gene has been doing is hiring the people to be with him, and so forth, much as a parent would do if asked to get some help in the house.\"\n\nIn the mid 1980s, Landy stated of Wilson, \"I influence all of his thinking. I'm practically a member of the band ... [We're] partners in life.\" Wilson later responded to allegations with, \"People say that Dr. Landy runs my life, but the truth is, I'm in charge.\" Landy echoed: \"He's got a car phone in his car. If he wants to call somebody, he calls somebody. ... He can go anywhere, on his own, anytime he wants.\" An August 1988 issue of \"Rolling Stone\" states the following:\n\nEven though the Beach Boys had hired Landy, part of the regimen involved cutting Wilson's contact from the group, as Landy reasoned: \"You can't deal with people who only want to use you.\" Wilson said that \"Dr. Landy doesn't like me to be in touch with my family too much. He thinks it's unhealthy.\" For example, Brian remembered participating in an interview with his brother Carl Wilson, \"and the interviewer asked Carl what it was between him and me. He goes, 'Well, Brian and I don't have to talk to each other. We're just Beach Boys, but we don't need to be friends.' And that's true. Although, whenever I think about him, I feel rotten.\"\n\nIn 1986 Wilson met his future wife and manager Melinda Ledbetter, a Cadillac saleswoman and former model, while browsing through a car dealership. Six months after meeting Wilson, she had reported Landy to the state's attorney general, who informed her that nothing could be done without the cooperation of Wilson's family. Ledbetter felt that the family had been at their \"rope's end\" with Wilson, and that they did not know what to do to help him. She said that three years into their relationship, Landy ordered Wilson to sever ties with Ledbetter.\n\nBetween 1983 and 1986, Landy charged about $430,000 annually, forcing Wilson's family members to devote some publishing rights to his fee. Landy received 25% of the copyright to all of Wilson's songs, regardless of whether he contributed to them or not, which band manager Tom Hulett explained was an incentive for Landy to reignite Wilson's drive. \"It was sort of like, 'Gee, there's nothing coming in now, if you can go make this person well to go create some income ...'\" Landy expressed similar views. \"Saying that [I would share in future songwriting royalties] in '84 was like me telling you, 'I'll pay you a million dollars if you can get up and fly around the room.'\" This arrangement was revoked in 1985, with Landy only receiving rights with a percentage equal to his writing contributions. Landy reported that he never received any money, since Wilson had not published any material before the pact was voided. Afterward, Wilson paid Landy a salary of about $300,000 a year for advice on creative decisions.\nIn late 1987, Landy and Wilson became creative partners in a company called Brains and Genius, a business venture where each member would contribute equally and share any profits from recordings, films, soundtracks, or books. Landy was then credited as co-writer and executive producer for Wilson's debut solo album, \"Brian Wilson\", released in 1988. Co-producer Russ Titelman disparaged Landy's role in the album's creation, calling him disruptive and \"anti-creative\". Wilson's cousin and bandmate Mike Love denied Landy's claims that the Beach Boys were preventing Wilson from participating on their recordings, and believed that the reason Landy encouraged Wilson to pursue a solo career \"was to destroy us. Then he would be the sole custodian of Brian's career and legacy.\" Landy maintained that his songwriting collaborations on \"Brian Wilson\" earned him less than $50,000.\n\nFor the publishing of Wilson's autobiographic memoir, \"\", Landy stood to earn 30% of its proceeds. The book glorifies Landy and its contents were challenged for plagiarism. Landy denied accusations that he was involved as a ghostwriter. Wilson later distanced himself from the book. In a 1995 court case, Wilson's lawyers argued that HarperCollins were aware that Wilson's statements in the book were either manipulated or written by Landy.\n\nAction was taken against Landy's professional practice as a result of the Beach Boys' and Wilson family's struggles for control. A former nurse and girlfriend of Wilson's brought Landy to the state's attention in 1984. The state was then aided by journals written by songwriter Gary Usher during a ten-month collaboration with Wilson. These journals depicted Wilson as a virtual captive dominated by Landy, who was determined to fulfill his show business ambitions through Wilson. By this time, Wilson had become Landy's only patient.\n\nIn February 1988, the State of California Board of Medical Quality charged Landy with ethical and license code violations stemming from the improper prescription of drugs and various unethical personal and professional relationships with patients, citing one case of sexual misconduct with a female patient, along with Wilson's psychological dependency on Landy. Landy denied the allegations, but later admitted to one of the seven charges which accused him of wrongfully prescribing drugs to Wilson. Landy surrendered his psychological license, complying with an agreement made with the state of California, and was not allowed applications for reinstatement for the next two years.\n\nAn August 1988 board meeting with the Beach Boys had Landy promising that Brian would reconnect with the group, which Love says: \"was a ruse to get us to write a letter in his defense against the California authorities. We never wrote the letter, and Brian's public behavior continued to unsettle.\" Landy and his colleagues claimed that his treatment of Wilson ended in February 1988 at the request of the state attorney general's office, but the deputy attorney who drafted the complaint reported that he was not aware of any such request, nor was the office advised that they sever Landy's relationship with Wilson. Co-producers of Wilson's solo album said they witnessed no changes, and Landy's assistants remained with Wilson. Sol Samuels said this was because Landy had little direct involvement with Wilson's treatment, and that it was instead the people Landy hired who continued to regulate Wilson's medication.\n\nAccording to songwriter P. F. Sloan, Landy took advantage of Sloan's disappearance and claimed at one point to be the real P. F. Sloan. He explains that it was an attempt by Landy to gain credibility and appease members of the medical community who were questioning why Landy felt that he was an appropriate songwriting collaborator for Wilson.\n\nPeter Reum, a therapist who met Wilson while attending a Beach Boys fan convention in 1990, was alarmed by Wilson's demeanor and speculated that he may be suffering from tardive dyskinesia, a neurological condition brought on by prolonged usage of antipsychotic medication. Reum phoned biographer David Leaf, who then reported Reum's observations to Carl Wilson. It was then discovered that Landy had been named as a chief beneficiary in a 1989 revision of Brian's will, collecting 70%, with the remainder split between his girlfriend and Brian's two daughters. This discovery was made by Kay Gilmer, a publicist employed by Landy in March 1990. She phoned Gary Usher to explain why his messages were not being returned, to which Usher warned: \"If Landy knows that you're calling me, he'd kill you. He'd literally kill you.\" Gilmer left her job two weeks later, taking expired drug bottles as well as names, phone numbers, and bank account information that she later turned over to the California Board of Medical Quality Assurance.\n\nAided by Gilmer's findings, Brian's cousin Stan Love filed unsuccessfully for conservatorship on May 17, 1990. A press conference with Stan at the lectern featured an unexpected appearance from Brian. While reading from a piece of paper, Brian was given a microphone and said: \"I have heard of the charges made by Stan Love, and I think they are outrageous, which means they are out of the ballpark ... I feel great.\" Audree, Carl, Carnie, and Wendy Wilson then contested Landy's control of Brian, pursuing legal action on May 7, 1991. The ruling was finalized on February 3, 1992 when Landy was barred by court order from contacting Brian, leaving his affairs to the hands of conservator Jerome S. Billet. In December 1992, Landy was fined $1,000 for violating the court order when he visited Brian in June for his birthday.\n\nLandy's treatment of Wilson in the 1980s was dramatized in the 2014 biographical film \"Love & Mercy\", in which Landy is portrayed by Paul Giamatti. These events are told from the point of view of Wilson's then-girlfriend Melinda Ledbetter. Landy's son Evan disputed the film's accuracy, believing that his father was unfairly portrayed. Mike Love commented that Evan's account was \"very interesting because you get an intimate look at someone who was with Brian every day for a few years\". Although he had not watched the film, he also said that it overstated Ledbetter's role in stopping the treatment.\n\nScreenwriter Oren Moverman stated that virtually everything in the 1980s portions was sourced from conversations he had with Ledbetter. He felt that Landy was the most difficult character to write for, \"even though many things that he says in the movie I actually have recording of, in real life he was a cartoon and in real life he was so over the top.\" Giamatti said he prepared for the role by meeting Landy's early career acquaintances and listening to hours of tapes where \"he'd just keep talking and talking, in these completely huge paragraphs. They were brilliant-sounding, but if you dug into them they didn't make much sense.\"\n\nLandy had one son in the early 1960s, Evan Landy.\n\nAfter the 1990s, Landy continued a psychotherapeutic practice with licensure in New Mexico and Hawaii up until his death. He died, aged 71, on March 22, 2006 in Honolulu, Hawaii, of pneumonia while suffering from lung cancer. When asked what his reaction to Landy's death had been, Wilson responded: \"I was devastated.\" In 2015, Wilson reflected, \"I thought he was my friend, but he was a very fucked-up man,\" and also, \"I still feel that there was benefit. I try to overlook the bad stuff, and be thankful for what he taught me.\"\n\nIn 1995, music producer Don Was commented that Wilson was \"so different from his public image as a drug burnout or of someone catatonic and propped up by a greedy psychologist. ... I knew Landy. I was around for the tail end of it, and I saw some gray in there; he wasn't just this evil guy who took over Brian.\"\n\nBibliography\n"}

In these countries, HIV-infected men outnumber HIV-infected women by roughly 3:1. Low prevalence in other countries disguises serious, localized epidemics. In Mexico, Brazil, Colombia and Argentina, intravenous drug use and homosexual activity are the main modes of transmission, and there is concern that heterosexual activity may soon become a primary method of spreading the virus.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "8580041", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=8580041", "title": "HIV/AIDS in the United Kingdom", "text": "HIV/AIDS in the United Kingdom\n\nIn 2015, the prevalence of HIV in the United Kingdom was estimated at 101,200 (0.16% of the population), 13% of whom are unaware of their infection. Prevalence is highest in gay/bisexual men in London with an estimated 1 in 7 living with HIV.However, the 2018 statistics showed tremendous decrease in the number of HIV infected gay men during 2015-2017.The number of HIV infected gay men decreased by a third in just two years.\n\nAn estimated 101,200 people are living with HIV in the UK. Of those, 69% are men and 31% were women. Just under half of those living with HIV are gay or bisexual men. 1 in 7 gay or bisexual men in London are living with HIV, compared to 1 in 25 in the rest of the UK and less than 1 in 500 for the general population.\n\n6095 people were newly diagnosed during 2015, a trend which has remained relatively constant since 2010. An estimated 39% of diagnoses were late (likely to have been living with the virus for over three years). This has improved since 2006 when 56% of people were diagnosed late. Late diagnosis is associated with a 10-fold increase in the chance of death during the first year after diagnosis. Over half of new diagnoses (3,320) were among gay or bisexual men. There has been a decrease in diagnoses amongst heterosexual black African men and women, from 73% in 2006 to 47% in 2015, largely due to trends in migration from high prevalence countries.\n\nHIV treatment is available free of charge in the UK and as a result 96% of diagnosed are receiving treatment and of those 94% have a suppressed viral load making them very unlikely to pass on the infection. In 2015, less than 1% of people living with a diagnosed HIV infection in the UK died (cause of death is uncertain and may not be HIV-related). All-cause mortality for ages 15–59 in people living with HIV was 5.7 per 1000 compared to 1.7 for the UK population as a whole. People newly diagnosed with HIV today can expect to have a normal life expectancy if they are diagnosed on time and on effective treatment.\n\nIn 2013, one in four adults seen for HIV care were 50 years of age or older. This is partly due to improvements to life expectancy for people living with HIV as well as increasing numbers of people acquiring HIV later in life.\n\nPre-exposure prophylaxis (\"PrEP\") using a drug which can prevent HIV infection, is available to high risk individuals as part of a three-year trial on the NHS, after a legal battle in the High Court. Use of PrEP in London, both as part of a trial and from private purchases, was partially credited in a drop in diagnoses among men who have sex with men, after a five-year plateau in diagnoses.\n\n1981, 12 December: A 49-year-old man dies in Brompton hospital due to an AIDS related illness - the first death in the UK.\n\n1982, 4 July: Terry Higgins dies of an AIDS related illness - leading to the establishment of the Terrence Higgins Trust.\n\n1987, 9 April: Princess Diana opens a new ward at Middlesex Hospital for the treatment of HIV patients, shaking the hands of AIDS patients without gloves.\n\n1987: The British Government launched \"AIDS: Don't Die of Ignorance\", a major public information campaign.

{"id": "2853049", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2853049", "title": "Hopkins syndrome", "text": "Hopkins syndrome\n\nHopkins syndrome is a neurological disorder. Its cause has not been established, but its association with asthma exacerbations (usually with a respiratory infection as a trigger) has led to suspicion that the initial viral insult that causes the respiratory infection is also implicated in the subsequent paralysis. Herpes simplex virus type I DNA has been found in the cerebrospinal fluid of at least one patient diagnosed with Hopkins syndrome. In several cases, anti-viral antibody titers for echovirus, enterovirus, coxsackievirus and poliovirus types 1, 2 and 3 were specifically sought; all were negative. There is one reported case in which \"Mycoplasma pneumoniae\" infection was found in the patient.\n\nThe syndrome appears to involve the spinal cord: specifically, the anterior horn cells subserving the affected muscles are often damaged. The evidence for anterior horn cell involvement comes from radiological and electromyographical studies. In one case, a biopsy of an affected muscle \"revealed scattered atrophic fibers, indicating lesions in the anterior horn cells of the spinal cord\".\n\nAs the illness is rare, no treatments have been subjected to a randomized controlled trial. Acyclovir, steroids and therapeutic plasma exchange have been tried; one report suggests that the latter is more effective than steroidal therapy. The prognosis for recovery of function of the affected limbs is generally considered to be poor.\n"}

{"id": "23456950", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=23456950", "title": "Jessica Hamby", "text": "Jessica Hamby\n\nJessica Hamby is a fictional character in the \"True Blood\" series, portrayed by Deborah Ann Woll. In the series, which chronicles the life of human waitress Sookie Stackhouse and her friends after vampires make themselves known to humans. Jessica is a newly turned vampire who must learn to deal with her vampiric abilities, weaknesses, and altered lifestyle.\n\nIn her human life, Jessica was raised in a strict, devout Christian family in Shreveport, Louisiana. Jessica and her younger sister Eden were homeschooled and only allowed to go to bible study and clarinet lessons. Her father would often beat Jessica with his belt to punish her for her faults. Jessica's mother was oblivious to this abuse - in a later episode, Jessica attributed this to her mother's \"stupidness\". Jessica resented the restrictions of her life dearly and secretly developed a rebellious attitude to her father's dominance, it’s also hinted that she might’ve been bullied by peers which might’ve further increased her frustration with the world around her. Shortly before her appearance in \"True Blood\", she chooses to sneak out after her bible study to attend a friend's party. In events off-screen, she was subsequently attacked & kidnapped by vampires and brought to the scene of a vampire trial, where the Magister, the enforcer of vampire justice, intended to use her as part of a sentence for a vampire on trial.\n\nWhile she is still human, Jessica is brought to a vampire trial. At this trial, the Magister (enforcer of vampire law) is reviewing the case of Bill Compton, who murdered another vampire that was trying to kill his girlfriend Sookie Stackhouse. The Magister decides that as a punishment for his deeds, Bill is to \"create\" a new vampire, and therefore presents him with a terrified human Jessica. Bill is reluctant but willingly goes along with the sentence as The Magister would torture her and make him watch, draining the struggling Jessica of all her blood and burying her underground with him for one night. This process transforms Jessica into a vampire successfully, but she is under the reign of her \"maker\", Bill, to which she does not take kindly. Jessica at first is saddened at the fact she can never go back to her family and live a normal life but immediately cheers over her new-found freedom and enhanced abilities. Bill teaches her to drink synthetic blood, as opposed to human blood, but Jessica doesn't like the synthetic blood. Eventually, she becomes such an obstacle to Bill that he leaves her to his vampire sheriff, Eric Northman (who she is attracted to), excited at the fact that she gets to feed off Humans and spend time with him she agrees. However, Eric grows tired of her as well and once again leaves her with Bill.\n\nSookie befriends Jessica and they bond over the grief they feel after having lost their family. Jessica feigns sympathy, and convinces Sookie to take her to see Jessica's family, but Jessica enters her old home, going against what she promised to Sookie, and confronts her father when he prepares to strike her with his belt in retaliation for being away for so long. Jessica states that her family is sick and that she desires to kill her father, but Bill intervenes and saves Jessica's family from harm, later erasing their memories and realizing her human life is over. After this, Jessica gradually begins to understand how to be a good vampire and starts a relationship with a human from Bill's hometown, Hoyt Fortenberry. At Carmilla Hotel, both admit they are still virgins and Hoyt covers the bed with rose petals before the two finally make love. Later in the series, as Jessica starts to have sex with Hoyt, she realizes her hymen has regenerated to its virginal state and she will always be a \"vampire virgin\". They break up briefly because of a conflict between Jessica and Hoyt's overbearing mother, Maxine, who is prejudiced against vampires, but eventually reconcile.\n\nJessica drains a trucker, killing him. She quickly regrets it and tries to heal him, but it doesn't work. Jessica is confronted by a vampire named Franklin, who pulls the truckers severed head from a paper bag. He tells Jessica he will help keep the corpse a secret in exchange for information on Bill Compton. Jessica is hired by Sam as a hostess at Merlotte's. While working, Jessica runs into Chip, an old classmate from Bible study. He is stunned to see her alive since her parents have been telling people she is dead. Jessica glamours Chip and convinces him that he never saw her. After a fight with Arlene, Jessica glamours all her customers not to tip her. She later regrets it and glamours the last customer into giving Arlene a big tip- after Jessica successfully feeds on the woman, without harming her.\n\nAfter Bill returns to Bon Temps, he releases her as her maker. Jessica not wanting to be alone however, declines to leave. The two reconcile and Bill trains Jessica to fight vampires and werewolves. Later that night, Jessica and Bill fight two werewolves in Sookie's house. After one escapes outside, Jessica follows him. She's captured by Russell, who bites her in front of Bill. He convinces Russell to let her go. Jessica captured the werewolf and drank from him. Hoyt shows up at Merlotte's with his new girlfriend Summer, and the couple are seated by a visibly upset Jessica. Hoyt tells Jessica he still has feelings for her and doesn't like Summer. Jessica becomes emotional, and Tommy Mickens only sees the end of the conversation which adds to his hatred of Hoyt. Hoyt tells Jessica that he loves her before he leaves Merlottes. As he leaves, he is attacked by Tommy (who has shifted into his dog form). Jessica comes to the rescue, telling Hoyt she loves him too. Injured, Hoyt drinks from Jessica so his wounds will heal.\n\nAfter Russell's appearance on TBBN, humans burn a cross on Bill and Jessica's front lawn. Jessica wants to hunt them down, but Bill convinces her that now is not the time for revenge. Jessica and Hoyt get back together. They tell each other how badly they missed one another. When things start getting serious, Jessica tells him about killing the trucker. She explains she's not going to stop drinking human blood and Hoyt immediately offers his own neck. Jessica goes right for it and Hoyt seems to like the experience. At the end of the season she is seen moving into a small house with Hoyt. The camera pans away to show a small voo-doo like doll on the floor. Maxine and Summer are also seen purchasing guns and wooden bullets at a nearby gun shop.\n\nJessica and Hoyt are seen living together for over a year. After working all day, Hoyt becomes angry with Jessica for not cooking him dinner, and really doesn’t like how dependent Hoyt is toward her, but he reminds her that she lives in his home and she feeds on him. The brief fight ends with the two laughing over a plate of uncooked eggs. Later, Hoyt brings Jessica to Fangtasia for a date night. Jessica flirts with other men which Pam describes as \"you've been eye-fucking every fang-banger in the place.\"\n\nJessica has the urge to go back to Fangtasia. She leaves to buy Hoyt some Advil, but after seeing a sign to Shreveport, she heads to Fangtasia. As soon as she enters, she approaches the young guy she saw while there with Hoyt. She feeds on him in the bathroom. Sookie, who is also there, confronts Jessica. She quickly tells Sookie to mind her own business.\n\nFeeling guilty for biting another human, Jessica goes to her maker Bill for advice. She returns home to tell Hoyt the truth. Hurt and angry, Hoyt and Jessica argue before she decides to glamour him into forgetting.\n\nIn a later episode, Hoyt and Jessica find Jason Stackhouse passed out and injured on the side of a road. Jessica quickly helps him by giving him her blood, healing him. Because she gave him her blood she is able to sense him and how he is feeling. In episode 6 of season 4 Jessica finds Jason in the woods panicked about turning into a werepanther (which he doesn't turn into in the end). She helps calm him down and talks to him for a while. The two part ways some time later but it is obvious that there is something going on between them, unspoken tension. Jessica later breaks up with Hoyt and moves back into Bill's house. Jason later comes by to drop off a box of Jessica's things from Hoyt's, and they end up having sex in the back of Jason's pick up truck.\n\nOn Halloween night, Jessica shows up on Jason's doorstep dressed in a sexy Halloween costume and the two make love but not form a relationship, though Jason boosts her confidence.\n\nJason is glamoured into listening to newly vampire Steve Newlin's story: he is gay and claims to be in love with Jason, who wants nothing to do with Newlin. Angered, Newlin attacks Jason and tries to bite him. Jessica then appears and threatens Newlin by saying that she has claimed Jason, Later, while partying with College students, when Jason comes in, still having feelings for her. After playing Guitar Hero, Jason tries to make a move on Jessica, but she rejects him, and makes out with a college guy, making Jason jealous. Jason then brings one of the girls with him to have sex, but instead takes her to her home, while Jessica watches him leave, wordless. Jessica develops a personality similar to Pam’s such as dressing sexy, talking down to others and hitting on as many guys as she can , Jessica tries to befriend the newly turned Tara, however the two come to blows over Tara's attempt to go too far drinking Hoyt, who has become a \"fang-banger\".\n\nWhile at Fangtasia another night, she is seduced by a young man and leaves the bar with him. She is then captured by a human supremacists group who have been responsible for the recent killings of super natural beings. Hoyt, who unknowingly became friends with members of the group, is brought in to kill Jessica for breaking his heart. They are locked in a room together with a guard outside; making it impossible to escape unless Hoyt kills her, there Jessica admits she no longer loved him when she cheated on him with Jason and might never love him again, Hoyt shoots the gun so that the guard will open the door, and Jessica is able to break the guard's neck. Hoyt goes to get help, as Jessica cannot leave during the day and she thanks him for not killing her, and Hoyt threatens to kill her for real if he sees her again. After both Hoyt and Sookie are rescued from the hate group, Hoyt tells Jason and Jessica that he plans to move to Alaska to start a new life, but wants Jessica to glamour him first. Tearfully, Jessica erases all of Hoyt's memories of his friendship with Jason, and their relationship as well. She then goes back to Bill's house.\n\nBill is Jessica's maker, but they do not have a good start: he was reluctant to \"create\" her and she does not find him a good teacher, calling him \"boring\" and feeling that he is holding her back from acting like a true vampire. Over time, she learns to follow his commands and he teaches her how to \"glamour\" (very effective vampire hypnosis techniques) and how to fight. As he disappears at the beginning of season 3, Jessica is very frightened and lost and displays great relief upon Bill's return. Bill does start to care for Jessica as he saves her life later on. In season 4, their relationship becomes stronger, despite him having released her, and she starts to see Bill more like a 'parent', while Bill sees her as his progeny even grieving when he thought she met her demise by a witch's spell.\n\nJessica meets Hoyt, a road crew worker, in the bar of Bill's hometown, Merlotte's. They have a conversation at the bar, then meet up at Bill's house, where Jessica lives. Jessica is very straightforward about her sexual desires, but Hoyt is a little reluctant. Bill breaks the duo up and forbids them from seeing each other, but as he takes Jessica with him on a trip to Dallas, Hoyt eventually shows up at Jessica's door and they ignite their romance. Jessica comes into conflict with Hoyt's overbearing mother Maxine, who disapproves of their relationship and is prejudiced against vampires. Later on, Maxine comes under the influence of a maenad and loses her limitations, after which she starts dishing out her true opinion on Jessica. Jessica attacks her, so Hoyt breaks up with her. In Season 3 he attempts to get back together with her but she refuses, as she is afraid of her vampire nature. However, after she saves Hoyt from an attack by a shapeshifter, they reconcile. They take their relationship to the next level; Hoyt tells Jessica he intends to marry her, and the two move in together in a new house. In season 4, however, a year into their relationship it has deteriorated. Hoyt and Jessica both have different needs and Jessica cheats on Hoyt twice (first with a random fangbanger, then by kissing Jason after he saved her life). Jessica contemplates leaving Hoyt, but when she does, he reacts angrily and cruelly reminds her of her shortcomings (such as her inability to have children) before kicking her out. She tries to seek Jason's help, but he rejects her also as he chooses his best friend's - Hoyt's - side. Jason eventually gives in to his feelings for Jessica, which earns the enmity of both Hoyt and Jason's former friends. Struggling with the pain of the breakup, Hoyt eventually asks Jessica to \"glamour\" or hypnotize away all his memories of her and Jason before he moves to Alaska. Hoyt returns in season 7, with his new girlfriend, Brigette. He meets Jessica again after saving her life from a sadistic vampire named Violet. She eventually falls for him again and tells him their story, accepting responsibility for the failure of their first relationship. Hoyt again has feelings for her, despite having only just \"met\" her. Jessica and Hoyt are married shortly after.\n\nIn season 4, Jessica begins to show interest in Jason Stackhouse. After Jason escapes from Hotshot, Jessica and Hoyt find him. Jessica gives Jason her blood to heal him, which causes him to develop romantic and sexual feelings for her. She comes to his rescue as he is in the woods with full moon and later on, he saves her as she is about to meet the sun under a witch' curse. Jason rejects Jessica after she breaks up with his best friend Hoyt, but later on they give in to their feelings and have sex. Afterward, Jason confesses that he feels guilty for betraying Hoyt, briefly souring their relationship. After Jason is nearly killed in an explosion and is again saved by drinking Jessica's blood, the two reconcile. On Halloween night Jessica comes to Jason's house and seduces him; later she tells Jason that she doesn't want to enter into a boyfriend/girlfriend relationship, at least not yet, which Jason reluctantly agrees to. Their relationship ultimately ends as what they describe as a \"beautiful friendship,\" when she is reunited with Hoyt and eventually marries him.\n"}

{"id": "45266571", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=45266571", "title": "Laboratory safety", "text": "Laboratory safety\n\nMany laboratories contain significant risks, and the prevention of laboratory accidents requires great care and constant vigilance. Examples of risk factors include high voltages, high and low pressures and temperatures, corrosive and toxic chemicals, and biohazards including infective organisms and their toxins.\n\nMeasures to protect against laboratory accidents include safety training and enforcement of laboratory safety policies, safety review of experimental designs, the use of personal protective equipment, and the use of the buddy system for particularly risky operations.\n\nIn many countries, laboratory work is subject by health and safety legislation. In some cases, laboratory activities can also present environmental health risks, for example, the accidental or deliberate discharge of toxic or infective material from the laboratory into the environment.\n\nHazardous chemicals present physical and/or health threats to workers in clinical, industrial, and academic laboratories. Laboratory chemicals include cancer-causing agents (carcinogens), toxins (e.g., those affecting the liver, kidney, and nervous system), irritants, corrosives, sensitizers, as well as agents that act on the blood system or damage the lungs, skin, eyes, or mucous membranes.\n\nMany laboratory workers encounter daily exposure to biological hazards. These hazards are present in various sources throughout the laboratory such as blood and body fluids, culture specimens, body tissue and cadavers, and laboratory animals, as well as other workers.\n\nThese are federally regulated biological agents (e.g., viruses, bacteria, fungi, and prions) and toxins that have the potential to pose a severe threat to public health and safety, to animal or plant health, or to animal or plant products.\n\n\nBesides exposure to chemicals and biological agents, laboratory workers can also be exposed to a number of physical hazards. Some of the common physical hazards that they may encounter include the following: ergonomic, ionizing radiation, non-ionizing\nradiation and noise hazards.\n\nLaboratory workers are at risk for repetitive motion injuries during routine laboratory procedures such as pipetting, working at microscopes, operating microtomes, using cell counters and keyboarding at computer workstations. Repetitive motion injuries develop over time and occur when muscles and joints are stressed, tendons are inflamed, nerves are pinched and the flow of blood is restricted. Standing and working in awkward positions in front of laboratory hoods/biological safety cabinets can also present ergonomic problems.\n\nIonizing radiation sources are found in a wide range of occupational settings, including laboratories. These radiation sources can pose a considerable health risk to affected workers if not properly controlled. Any laboratory possessing or using radioactive isotopes must be licensed by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) and/or by a state agency that has been approved by the NRC, 10 CFR 31.11 and 10 CFR 35.12.\n\nThe fundamental objectives of radiation protection measures are:\n\n\n\nWorkers should be trained to recognize the potential for exposure to burns or cuts that can occur from handling or sorting hot sterilized items or sharp instruments when removing them from autoclaves/sterilizers or from steam lines that service the autoclaves.\n\nCentrifuges, due to the high speed at which they operate, have great potential for injuring users if not operated properly. Unbalanced centrifuge rotors can result in injury, even death. Sample container breakage can generate aerosols that may be harmful if inhaled.\nThe majority of all centrifuge accidents are the result of user error.\n\nLaboratory standard for compressed gas\n\nWithin laboratories, compressed gases are usually supplied either through fixed piped gas systems or individual cylinders of gases. Compressed gases can be toxic, flammable, oxidizing, corrosive, or inert. Leakage of any of these gases can be hazardous.\n\n\nCryogens, substances used to produce very low temperatures [below -153 °C (-243 °F)], such as liquid nitrogen (LN) which has a boiling point of -196 °C (-321 °F), are commonly used in laboratories.\n\nAlthough not a cryogen, solid carbon dioxide or dry ice which converts directly to carbon dioxide gas at -78 °C (-109 °F) is also often used in laboratories. Shipments packed with dry ice, samples preserved with liquid nitrogen, and in some cases, techniques that use cryogenic liquids, such as cryogenic grinding of samples, present potential hazards in the laboratory.\n\nHand protection is required to guard against the hazard of touching cold surfaces. It is recommended that Cryogen Safety Gloves be used by the worker.\n\nEye protection is required at all times when working with cryogenic fluids. When pouring a cryogen, working with a wide-mouth Dewar flask or around the exhaust of cold boil-off gas, use of a full face shield is recommended.\n\nPersonal protective equipment or PPE are equipments worn to prevent against exposure of hazardous substances. Although, PPE does not eliminate the risks of hazards but it helps protect the user from the exposure. To make a workplace safer, it should provide instructions and training of how to use and choose proper PPE in different situations.\n\nPPE includes: \n\nIn the laboratory, there is the potential for workers to be exposed to electrical hazards including electric shock, electrocutions, fires and explosions. Damaged electrical cords can lead to possible shocks or electrocutions. A flexible electrical cord may be damaged by door or window edges, by staples and fastenings, by equipment rolling over it, or simply by aging.\n\nThe potential for possible electrocution or electric shock or contact with electrical hazards can result from a number of factors, including the following:\n\nFire is the most common serious hazard that one faces in a typical laboratory. While proper procedures and training can minimize the chances of an accidental fire, laboratory workers should still be prepared to deal with a fire emergency should it occur. In dealing with a laboratory fire, all containers of infectious materials should be placed into autoclaves, incubators, refrigerators, or freezers for containment.\n\nSmall bench-top fires in laboratory spaces are not uncommon. Large laboratory fires are rare. However, the risk of severe injury or death is significant because fuel load and hazard levels in labs are typically very high. Laboratories, especially those using solvents in any quantity, have the potential for flash fires, explosion, rapid spread of fire, and high toxicity of products of combustion (heat, smoke, and flame)\n\n\n"}

{"id": "31974159", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=31974159", "title": "List of nutrition guides", "text": "List of nutrition guides\n\nThis is a list of nutrition guides. A nutrition guide is a reference that provides nutrition advice for general health, typically by dividing foods into food groups and recommending servings of each group. Nutrition guides can be presented in written or visual form, and are commonly published by government agencies, health associations and university health departments.\n\nMost countries also have nutrition facts labels which are not listed here; many of those reference specific target amounts for various nutrients.\n\nThe Hippocratic Corpus of Ancient Greece contains one of the earliest known nutrition guides. It recommends a seasonal diet. For winter, it advises eating a heavy diet of bread and roasted meat and fish, while avoiding vegetables and restricting liquids to, if anything, strong wine. It then recommends a lighter summer diet of soft barley cake, vegetables, boiled meat, and large quantities of diluted wine. Gradual transitions between these two diets are advised in the intervening months.\n\nDuring the Tang Dynasty, Chinese physician Sun Simiao is believed to have written the first nutrition guide in traditional Chinese medicine. In his book, \"Precious Prescriptions for Emergencies\" (), the chapter \"Dietary Treatment\" () contains sections describing the effects of eating fruits, vegetables, grains and animals.\n\nAmid high food prices in 1972, Sweden's National Board of Health and Welfare developed the idea of \"basic foods\" that were both cheap and nutritious, and \"supplemental foods\" that added nutrition missing from the basic foods. KF, a consumer co-op that worked with the Board, sought to illustrate these food groups. KF developed a food pyramid because it could depict basic foods as its base, and introduced the guide to the public in 1974 in their magazine, \"\". At the base were bread, cereals, potatoes, milk, cheese and margarine; above it was a large section of supplemental vegetables and fruit; and at the top was an apex of supplemental meat, fish and eggs. The pyramid competed with the National Board's \"dietary circle,\" which KF saw as problematic for resembling a cake divided into seven slices, and for not indicating how much of each food should be eaten. While the Board distanced itself from the pyramid, KF continued to promote it, and food pyramids were developed in other Scandinavian countries, plus West Germany, Japan and Sri Lanka. The United States later developed its first food pyramid in 1992.\n\nToday, both the Swedish government and KF have moved to the Plate Model.\n\nThe Australian Department of Health and Ageing publishes The Australian Guide to Healthy Eating, which features a wheel divided into five sections: approximately 40 percent bread, cereals, rice, pasta and noodles; 30 percent vegetables and legumes; 10 percent fruit; 10 percent milk, yogurt and cheese; and 10 percent lean meat, fish, poultry, eggs, nuts and legumes. Below the wheel are reminders to drink plenty of water and eat fats and sweets occasionally or in small amounts. More specific recommendations are provided based on age, gender, life stage and activity level.\n\nThe Austrian Federal Ministry of Health uses The Austrian Food Pyramid (), which is divided into 25 blocks, each block representing a daily serving from a food group. Starting at the base, there are six servings of non-alcoholic beverages (preferably low-energy drinks like water, tea, unsweetened fruit juice and vegetable juice); three servings of vegetables and legumes; two of fruit; four of cereals, bread, pasta, rice and potatoes (preferably whole grains); three of milk and dairy (two \"white,\" like milk, yogurt or cream cheese, and one of yellow cheese); one of fats and oil (preferably olive or canola oil); three of meat, fish, sausage and eggs (preferably fish or lean meat); and three of fatty, sweet and salty foods (though not nutritionally recommended and to be consumed rarely).\n\nThe Voedingsdriehoek is a (mostly in Flanders) widely used tool for dietitians, health educators, schools, etc. to explain a balanced diet.\nThe triangle is constructed as a pyramid with five different layers. The bottom layer is the largest in area, so the most important, the top is narrow and there represents little food, although it is an essential ingredient. The layers are (from top to bottom):\n- Oil / fats\n- Protein: meat, fish, eggs, dairy products, meat substitutes\n- Fruits and vegetables\n- Starch or carbohydrates (bread, potatoes, rice, pasta, etc.)\n- Drinks\nIn 2005 a (rather symbolically) layer was added at the bottom: sports and exercise. This is not a food, but an important part of a healthy diet and lifestyle. The information services use the \"active\" food pyramid.\n\nBrazil's Ministry of Health publishes the Food Guide (), which features a map of Brazil depicting each of Brazil's five regions as puzzle pieces representing a food group. However, Brazil's food recommendations differ from the map, and feature eight food groups: rice, bread, pasta, potato and cassavas (5 servings a day); vegetables and legumes (3 servings); fruits (3); milk, cheese and yogurt (3); beans (1); meat, fish and eggs (1); oils and fats (1); and sugars and sweets (no more than one).\n\nCanada's Food Guide from Health Canada is illustrated with a rainbow of four food groups: vegetables and fruit (7 to 10 servings a day for adults, depending on biological sex), grain products (6 to 8), milk and alternatives (2), and meat and alternatives (2 to 3). More specific recommendations are provided based on age, gender and life stage.\n\nCanada developed its first nutrition guide in 1942 as part of its wartime nutrition program.\n\nChina's Ministry of Health uses the Balanced Diet Pagoda (), which is divided into five stories ascending from largest to smallest. Cereals are at the large base; topped by vegetables and fruits; then fish, poultry, meat, eggs and other animal foods; followed by milk and soy foods; and topped with fats and oils in the small spire. Beside the pagoda are images representing water and exercise.\n\nDenmark's Food Administration uses the Diet Compass () to depict its \"Dietary 8\" () guidelines, with an image on each compass point representing a guideline. Those guidelines are: \"Eat 6 fruits and vegetables a day,\" \"Eat fish and seafood several times a week,\" \"Eat potatoes, rice or pasta and whole wheat bread every day,\" \"Cut back on sugar,\" \"Cut back on greasy foods,\" \"Eat a varied diet and maintain a normal weight,\" \"Quench your thirst with water,\" and, \"Be physically active at least 30 minutes a day.\"\n\nFrance's has 25 separate food guides under the title The Food Guide For All (). Each guide is based on a consumer's personality, habits and lifestyle. There are guides for people who: are health-conscious, don't care about food, prepare family meals, are poor, eat at restaurants, skip meals, don't cook, have large appetites, are on diets, prefer certain foods, avoid various foods (including meat), are sedentary, are athletic, and more. Each guide features a \"portrait\" in the image of a happy face designed out of foods representing that consumer's type. The portraits are billed as nutrition recommendations, though they are more decorative than informative.\n\nGermany's state-funded uses the Food Pyramid (), which divides a pyramid into 22 blocks, each block representing a hand-sized serving from a food group. Starting at the base, there are six blocks for beverages, three for vegetables, two for fruit, four for grains, three for dairy, one for meat and fish, one for oils, one for fats, and one for sweets and alcohol. Beverages, vegetables, fruit and grains are marked green for \"free travel\"; meat and dairy are marked yellow for \"caution\"; and oils, fats, sweets and alcohol are marked red for \"brake lights\". Aid also collaborated with the German Nutrition Society to create a 3D pyramid model.\n\nIndia's National Institute of Nutrition publishes the Dietary Guidelines for Indians, which, among other diagrams, includes the Food Pyramid. The pyramid has a base of beans and legumes to eat adequately, a second layer of vegetables and fruit to eat liberally, a third layer of meat, fish, eggs and oils to eat moderately, and an apex of fatty, salty and sugary foods to eat sparingly. Accompanying the pyramid is a recommendation of regular exercise and physical activity, as well as warnings against drinking alcohol and smoking.\n\nThe island of Ireland's Food Safety Promotion Board uses The Food Pyramid, which is divided into five levels: bread, cereals and potatoes at the large base (6 or more servings); then fruit and vegetables (5); followed by milk, cheese and yogurt (3); then meat, fish, eggs and alternatives (2); and finally fats, high fat/sugar snacks, foods and drinks at the apex (small amounts). At least 8 cups of water a day are also recommended.\n\nThe Food Pyramid () from Israel's Ministry of Health is divided into six levels. At the wide base is water; followed by starches, including pasta, bread, corn and yams; then fruits and vegetables; then meat, fish, eggs and dairy; then fats and oils; and finally sugary foods at the small apex. Images around the pyramid represent exercise.\n\nThe Italian Ministry of Health uses the Italian Food Pyramid (), which is divided into squares, triangles, trapezoids and rectangles that represent one, one-half, one-and-a-half, and two servings, respectively. Beginning from the base, the divisions are: fruit (2 servings), water (1), vegetables (2), bread (1.5), biscotti (0.5), potatoes (0.5), rice and pasta (1.5), meat (1), eggs (0.5), fish (0.5), legumes (0.5), cold cut meats (0.5), milk (0.5), dairy (0.5), oils and fats (1), sweets (0.5) and wine or beer (0.5). Along the edges of the pyramid are triangles representing physical activity. The pyramid is intended to represent the variety of foods eaten over an entire week, averaged into daily portions. Also provided is an alternative, more traditional pyramid for a single day, divided into six layers representing six food groups; as well as two additional pyramids for children.\n\nThe Food Guide (), from Japan's Health and Agriculture ministries, is depicted as a spinning top with a wide upper layer tapering to a narrow bottom. At the large upper level is a staple meal of carbohydrates, including rice, bread and noodles (5 to 7 servings a day); followed below by a side dish of vegetables, potatoes, beans (except soybeans), mushrooms and seaweed (5 to 6); then a smaller main course of protein, including meat, fish, eggs and soy (3 to 5); and finally the narrow point, divided between dairy (2) and fruit (2). The top's handle is filled with \"essential\" water and tea, and running in circles around the handle is a figure representing moderate exercise. A small motion line beside the top represents sweet beverages in moderation.\n\nMexico's Department of Nutrition and Health Promotion uses The Plate of Good Eating (), which is divided into thirds: vegetables and fruits (in equal proportion); cereals; and legumes and animal products. The guide further recommends eating \"many\" vegetables and fruits and \"enough\" cereals. The legume and animal products section is subdivided, and \"few\" animal products are recommended, while the guide recommends combining the larger legume section with cereals. Additional recommendations are to include each of the three food groups in each of the three main meals of the day, to eat the greatest possible variety of food, to eat according to individual needs and conditions, and to eat the least possible fats, oils, sugar and salt.\n\nThe Netherlands Nutrition Center uses the Wheel of Five (), which is divided into five groups: approximately 30 percent vegetables and fruit; 30 percent bread, cereals, potatoes, rice, pasta, couscous, and legumes; 16 percent dairy, meat, fish, eggs and meat substitutes; 16 percent beverages; and 8 percent fats and oils. More specific recommendations are provided based on age and gender.\n\nSouth Korea's Korean Nutrition Society uses the Food Bicycle (), with a small front wheel filled with water and a large rear wheel composed of approximately one-third grains; 20 percent meat, fish, eggs and beans; 20 percent vegetables; 12 percent fruits; 12 percent dairy; and 3 percent oils and sugars. A person is pedaling the bicycle, representing exercise. More specific recommendations are provided based on age, gender and life stage.\n\nBefore 2010, South Korea used a very similar to China's current guide.\n\nSpain's Ministry of Health, Social Policy and Equality uses the NAOS Pyramid (), which promotes a Mediterranean diet as well as plenty of physical activity, and is drawn as a sailboat on water. It is divided into beverages and water at the base; an equal division between physical activity and a combination of grains, vegetables, tubers, fruit, olive oil and dairy in the second level, which is labeled \"several times a day\" and color-coded green; an equal division between sports and a combination of meat, fish, eggs, legumes and nuts in the third level, which is labeled \"several times a week\" and is color-coded orange; and an apex of saturated fats, sugars, salt, and sedentary activity labeled \"occasionally\" and color-coded red.\n\nSweden's Food Agency uses the Plate Model (), which divides a plate into approximately 40 percent potatoes, rice, pasta and bread; 40 percent vegetables and fruit; and 20 percent meat, fish, eggs and legumes. People requiring more energy are allowed a larger share of carbohydrates, while people who are overweight can make up to half their plate vegetables and fruit.\n\nPreviously, Sweden used the Dietary Circle created in 1963, while Swedish consumer cooperative KF created the world's first food pyramid in 1974.\n\nSwitzerland's Federal Office of Public Health uses the Food Pyramid () developed by the Swiss Society for Nutrition. At the base is 1 to 2 liters of liquids, preferably non-sugared beverages; then three servings of vegetables and two servings of fruit of different colors; followed by whole grains, beans, cereals and potatoes to be eaten with each meal; then three servings of milk or dairy; one serving of meat, fish, eggs, cheese or another protein; oils, fats and nuts daily in moderation; and an apex of sweet/salty snacks and sweetened/alcoholic drinks in moderation for pleasure.\n\nTurkey's Ministry of Health uses the Basic Food Groups (), a four-part division of milk and dairy; meat, eggs, fish, legumes and seeds; vegetables and fruit; and bread and cereal. Each food group is accompanied by bullet points, such as serving recommendations or advice to eat more raw vegetables and whole grains.\n\nThe United Kingdom's Department of Health published Dietary Reference Values. These are equivalent to the easier to understand Eatwell plate used by the National Health Service. This consists of roughly one-third fruit and vegetables (\"at least 5 portions\"); one-third bread, rice, potatoes and pasta (\"plenty\"); a smaller amount of milk and dairy (\"some\"); meat, fish, eggs and beans in the same proportion as dairy (\"some\"); and a small wedge of fatty and sugary foods.\n\nIn the United States, the Department of Agriculture uses MyPlate, a plate icon divided into approximately 30 percent grains, 30 percent vegetables, 20 percent fruits and 20 percent protein, accompanied by a smaller circle representing dairy. Additional recommendations include to enjoy food but eat less, avoid oversized portions, make at least half of grains whole, switch to fat-free or low-fat milk, choose foods with less sodium, and drink water instead of sugary drinks.\n\nPrevious USDA food guides include the Basic 7 (1943–1956), the Basic Four (1956–1992), the Food Guide Pyramid (1992–2005), and MyPyramid (2005–2011).\n\nThe National Institutes of Health uses the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) Eating Plan for people seeking to lower their blood pressure. DASH differs from MyPlate in that the protein category is replaced by a smaller proportion of lean meats, poultry, and fish; there are separate sections for fats and oils, legumes, and sweets; and fruits and vegetables don't constitute half of the diet.\n\nThe Center for Nutrition Policy and Promotion in the USDA and the United States Department of Health and Human Services jointly release a longer textual document called \"Dietary Guidelines for Americans\", updated in 2015 with the next scheduled revision in 2012.\n\nDietary Reference Intake values are published by the Institute of Medicine for general use, but nutrition facts labels in the U.S. use the older Reference Daily Intake standards instead.\n\nThe World Health Organization uses The 3 Fives, a guide featuring five key points in each of three categories. The three categories are safer food, a healthy diet, and appropriate physical activity. In the healthy diet category, the five keys are: \"Give your baby only breast milk for the first 6 months of life,\" \"Eat a variety of food,\" \"Eat plenty of vegetables and fruit,\" \"Eat moderate amounts of fats and oil,\" and \"Eat less salt and sugar.\" Each key includes bullet points with further recommendations. The 3 Fives was originally developed for distribution at major sporting events like the Olympics and the World Cup, but it can also be used for general audiences.\n\nBefore The 3 Fives, the WHO used the CINDI dietary guide, which included the CINDI pyramid. The guide was intended to help European health professionals and policymakers develop their own national nutrition guides. The pyramid has a large green base representing approximately two-thirds of the triangle's area, which is filled with vegetables, fruits, grains and starches. A middle layer shaded orange for \"caution\" is divided into two equal sections: low-fat milk and dairy; and beans, lentils, legumes, fish, eggs, poultry and lean meat. At the top is a small \"red zone\" of fats and sweets.\n\nFAO provides technical assistance to countries for developing, revising and implementing food-based dietary guidelines (FBDG) and food guides in line with current scientific evidence. FAO also carries out periodic reviews on progress made in the development and use of dietary guidelines. FAO's food based dietary guidelines website collects more than 80 national guidelines.\n\n"}

His father was a school teacher called Johan Karl Westenhöffer, but the son later simplified the spelling of his surname. His mother's maiden name was Knell, and in later years her name was sometimes appended to his according to the Spanish naming custom. making his name Max Westenhöfer Knell.\n\nHe studied at the University of Berlin where he graduated in 1894. He was a pupil of Rudolf Virchow, German physician and Professor of Pathology at the University of Berlin, known also for his interest in public health. His first employment was as an army doctor, which he remained, apart from three years in Chile, until 1922.\n\nIn 1908 he was hired by Augusto Matte, on behalf of the government of Chile, to teach Pathology at the School of Medicine of the University of Chile. As an international expert with the role to reform and modernize the teaching of pathology in Chile, the Chilean government provided him a higher salary than the local medical colleagues which motivated envy and resentment among some Chilean physicians. In 1911 he published what has been called the \"Westenhöfer Report\", a five article series published in the German medical journal \"Berliner klinische Wochenschrift\" where he described in critical terms the poor health conditions and hygiene practices that he observed in certain urban areas and nursing homes in Santiago of Chile. His report led to protests from the conservative sector of the Chilean society which eventually led the government to deport him from Chile. However, the University of Chile Student Federation (FECH) including his medical students, some unions, and leftist parties gave public support to Prof. Westenhöffer and protested at his expulsion. In August 1911 there was a massive march in Santiago of Chile to protest at his expulsion and make a judicial appeal to prevent it, which did not take place until after he had left.\n\nFollowing his departure in 1911 he returned to Germany and resumed his career with the army. During World War I, he served as a military surgeon with the rank of major (\"Oberstabsarzt\") and was awarded the Iron Cross, second class. In 1922 he became Professor of Pathology at the University of Berlin.\nAt this time he was also deputy chairman of the Berlin \"Gesellschaft für Rassenhygiene\" (German Society for Racial Hygiene).\n\nHe returned to Chile in 1929 and for three years directed the Department of Pathology at the Medical School of the University of Chile. This was his most fruitful period in furthering the development and the quality of Chilean medicine. He modernised the practice of pathology and trained Chilean colleagues. Pathology institutes were founded in the hospitals in Santiago and Valparaiso. His stress on the social determinants of mortality and morbidity influenced a generation of students, including Salvador Allende, a medical student activist and later President of Chile.\n\nWhile in Chile, after studying the data on the occurrence of syphilis he contributed to the still ongoing controversy about the origin of this disease. Westenhöfer observed little effect of the disease in Indian carriers and the terrible effects experienced by those of European origin who were infected, which led him to state that a corresponding STD existed in America before the European conquest.\n\nHe returned again to Germany where he spent the war years, living latterly in retirement in Wasserburg am Bodensee. From 1923 onwards he wrote several books and papers on human evolution, perhaps most fully in his 1942 book \"Der Eigenweg des Menschen\" (translated as \"The Path Travelled by Man Alone\" or \"The Unique Road to Man\") which put forward ideas suggesting, amongst other things, that adaptation to water has played a significant part in the history of human development. That particular idea has since been developed as the controversial Aquatic ape hypothesis (AAH), but the details of Westenhöfer's theory, such as that bipedalism is primitive in mammals, are not shared by most modern supporters of the AAH.\n\nIn 1948, at the age of 77 he returned once more to Chile under a contract with the Junta Central de Beneficencia (Central Board of Charities) to serve as a pathology adviser. For his long record of contributions in Chile he was decorated by the government with the Order of Bernardo O'Higgins. His legacy on the teaching of the anatomic pathology in Chile was continued by his students, especially Dr Ismael Mena at the University of Chile and Dr Roberto Barahona Silva, founder of the Department of Pathology at the Pontifical Catholic University of Chile.\n\nWestenhöfer was married twice. From the first marriage, to Anna Maria, he had three children, Grete, who was born in Chile, and Rudolf who was educated at the German School of Santiago. Only Wolf survived the war and lived in Berlin with six children. His second marriage was to Jutta, née Windmŭller, who survived him.\n\nHe died on September 25, 1957 in Santiago de Chile, which he considered his second home. Dr. Westenhöfer was buried in the Cementerio General de Santiago.\n\n\n\n"}

The Muisca were an advanced civilization inhabiting the central highlands of the Colombian Andes (Altiplano Cundiboyacense) before the Spanish conquest of the Muisca in the 1530s. Their diet and cuisine consisted of many endemic flora and fauna of Colombia. Main product of the Muisca was maize, in various forms. The advantage of maize was that it could be grown in the various climatic zones the Muisca territories experienced. It was the basis for their diet and the alcoholic drink, chicha, made from fermented maize and sugar. In the Muisca religion their agriculture and celebration of harvests, conducted along the complex Muisca calendar, were protected by Chaquén and Nencatacoa. The Muisca ate a variety of roots and tubers and even had a specific word in their Chibcha language for eating those: \"bgysqua\".\n\nThe Muisca cultivated many different crops in their own regions, part of the Muisca Confederation, and obtained more exotic culinary treats through trade with neighbouring indigenous peoples, with as most important; the Lache (cotton, tobacco, tropical fruits, sea snails), Muzo (emeralds, Magdalena River fish, access to gold, spices), Achagua (coca, feathers, yopó, Llanos Basin fish, curare). The climatic variation of the Muisca territories allowed for the agriculture of different crops. Javier Ocampo López describes the Muisca diet as predominantly vegetarian: potatoes, maize, beans, mandioca, tomatoes, calabazas, peppers and numerous fruits. The Muisca also used grains known today as quinoa. Main base for the Muisca cuisine was maize, considered a holy crop. The Muisca roasted corn (maize), ate it off the plant or converted it into popcorn. Main meat was the guinea pig, endemic to South America, which they farmed in their homes. In special cases they ate llamas, alpacas, deer, capybara (\"chigüiro\" in Spanish), and fish from the rivers and lakes of the Altiplano Cundiboyacense and Magdalena and Llanos through trade. The Muisca drank a lot of chicha, a fermented alcoholic drink of maize and sugar, served in ceramic pots called \"urdu\" or \"aryballus\".\n\nPaleodietary studies performed on the Bogotá savanna, where 18 Muisca skeletons ranging in historical age from 8th to 10th century AD and 26 skeletons from the 12th and 13th century AD, together with analysis of 10 mummies of the Guane, Lache and Muisca were analysed, have shown that about 60% of the food of the people consisted of vegetary products and 40% of meat and especially fish.\n\nAfter the Spanish conquest, the access to meat was drastically reduced changing the diet of the Muisca and other indigenous groups of central Colombia. Studies from Tunja, called Hunza in the time of the Muisca, have shown the people did not suffer from malnutrition though.\n\nAs maize was the most important crop and food for the Muisca, their language (Muysccubun) had many different words for maize, parts of the plant and the different processes and eating habits.\n\n\"Note: for the pronunciation, it helps to think Spanish; \"j\" refers to hard English \"h\"-sound, not the soft English \"j/y\"\"\n\nThe Muisca cultivated their crops in so-called \"camellones\", artificially elevated surfaces that allowed the roots of the crops to be sufficiently irrigated with the -on average 700-1000 mm of- rain in a year and drainage systems regulating the water levels.\n\nMain plants to be cultivated were:\n\n\n\n\n\nAs Colombia has the biggest biodiversity of birds in the world, they formed part of their cuisine, mainly:\n\n\n\nUsing the abundant coal of the Muisca territories, they heated their ovens and cooked their food.\n\nThe Muisca sat down on the ground while eating and they didn't use cutlery, yet ate with their hands.

In 1996 the Government of President Chandrika Kumaratunga had established a new health policy, one stated aim of which was to develop and implement a National Drug Policy for the rational use and distribution of drugs. While this policy continues to this day, no concrete measures had been adopted for its implementation.\n\nIn 2005 the United People's Freedom Alliance Government promised to establish a National Medicinal Drugs Policy (NMPD) that would enable Sri Lankans significantly to cut down on drug expenses and get quality drugs at affordable prices while saving billions of Rupees in foreign exchange for the country. It anticipated that the implementation of the NMDP could reduce the number of drugs imported, prescribed and sold in Sri Lanka to about 350 varieties.\n\nConsultations were held with all stakeholders, presided over by Prof. Krisantha Weerasuriya, the World Health Organization (WHO) Regional Advisor, Essential Medicines over four days in June 2005, and the draft for the NMDP was prepared. In October, the Minister of Health obtained cabinet approval for the draft NMDP and promised that the appropriate legislation would be introduced in parliament.\n\nIn February 2006 the Health Ministry called another meeting of all stakeholders and the Minister gave assurances that the NMDP would be implemented within weeks. An eighteen-member National Standing Committee (NSC), including a representative of the People’s Movement for the Rights of Patients, was appointed in March to oversee and expedite the implementation of the Drug Policy based on the Seneka Bibile principles of rational drug use. The NSC was advised by the Legal Draftsman that new legislation should be drafted for the establishment of the NMDA.\n\nDuring 2007, popular pressure for the implementation of the NMPD grew. In October, the Cabinet approved to a Memorandum submitted by Healthcare and Nutrition Minister Nimal Siripala de Silva on the establishment of the National Medicinal Drug Authority (NMDA) and granted its approval to draft a new Act with the assistance of the Legal Draftsman to expedite the implementation of the NMPD by repealing or amending the existing Cosmetics Devices and Drugs Act where necessary.\n\n\nPlease see the links to the National Medicinal Drug Policy adopted by the government of Sri Lanka:\n"}

It is very active in fighting efforts to raise the minimum wage in the United States as well as laws requiring paid sick leave. In July 2013, it boasted that it had successfully lobbied against raises in the minimum wage in 27 of 29 states and blocked paid sick leave legislation in 12 states. It also takes credit for halting any increase in the federal minimum wage for tipped employees, which has remained at $2.13 per hour since 1991.\n\nThe NRA supported the Fighting Hunger Incentive Act of 2014 (H.R. 4719; 113th Congress), a bill that would amend the Internal Revenue Code to make permanent extend and to expand certain expired provisions that provided an enhanced tax deduction for businesses that donated their food inventory to charitable organizations. The NRA argued that \"the deduction for charitable donation of food inventory is a critical tool in alleviating hunger\" because it \"encourages donating the food to charity, by helping to offset the costs associated with preserving, storing and transporting the extra food.\"\n\nThe NRA opposed the National Labor Relations Board's joint employer standard, but was unable to affect a change in legislation repealing the standard.\n\nThe National Restaurant Association develops food safety training and certification program for restaurant employees.

{"id": "747363", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=747363", "title": "Operationalization", "text": "Operationalization\n\nIn research design, especially in psychology, social sciences, life sciences, and physics, operationalization is a process of defining the measurement of a phenomenon that is not directly measurable, though its existence is inferred by other phenomena. Operationalization thus defines a fuzzy concept so as to make it clearly distinguishable, measurable, and understandable by empirical observation. In a broader sense, it defines the extension of a concept—describing what is and is not an instance of that concept. For example, in medicine, the phenomenon of health might be operationalized by one or more indicators like body mass index or tobacco smoking. As another example, in visual processing the presence of a certain object in the environment could be inferred by measuring specific features of the light it reflects. In these examples, the phenomena are difficult to directly observe and measure because they are general/abstract (as in the example of health) or they are latent (as in the example of the object). Operationalization helps infer the existence, and some elements of the extension, of the phenomena of interest by means of some observable and measurable effects they have.\n\nSometimes multiple or competing alternative operationalizations for the same phenomenon are available. Repeating the analysis with one operationalization after the other can determine whether the results are affected by different operationalizations. This is called checking robustness. If the results are (substantially) unchanged, the results are said to be \"robust against certain alternative operationalizations\" of the checked variables.\nThe concept of operationalization was first presented by the British physicist N. R. Campbell in his 'Physics: The Elements' (Cambridge, 1920). This concept spread to humanities and social sciences. It remains in use in physics.\n\nOperationalization is the scientific practice of \"operational definition\", where even the most basic concepts are defined through the operations by which we measure them. The practice originated with the philosophy of science book \"The Logic of Modern Physics\" (1927), by Percy Williams Bridgman, whose methodological position is called operationalism.\n\nBridgman wrote that in the theory of relativity a concept like \"duration\" can split into multiple different concepts. In refining a physical theory, it may be discovered that what was thought to be one concept is actually two or more distinct concepts. Bridgman proposed that if only operationally defined concepts are used, this will never happen.\n\nBridgman's theory was criticized because \"length\" is measured in various ways (e.g. it's impossible to use a measuring rod to measure the distance to the Moon), so \"length\" logically isn't \"one\" concept but \"many\", some concepts requiring knowledge of geometry. Each concept is to be \"defined by\" the measuring operation used. Another example is the radius of a sphere, obtaining different values depending on the way it is measured (say, in metres and in millimeters). Bridgman said the concept is defined on the measurement. So the criticism is that there are potentially infinite concepts, each defined by the methods that measured it, such as angle of sighting, day of the solar year, angular subtense of the moon, etc. which were gathered together, some astronomical observations taken over a period of thousands of years.\n\nThe practical 'operational definition' is generally understood as relating to the theoretical definitions that describe reality through the use of theory.\n\nThe importance of careful operationalization can perhaps be more clearly seen in the development of General Relativity. Einstein discovered that there were two operational definitions of \"mass\" being used by scientists: \"inertial\", defined by applying a force and observing the acceleration, from Newton's Second Law of Motion; and \"gravitational\", defined by putting the object on a scale or balance. Previously, no one had paid any attention to the different operations used because they always produced the same results, but the key insight of Einstein was to posit the Principle of Equivalence that the two operations would always produce the same result because they were equivalent at a deep level, and work out the implications of that assumption, which is the General Theory of Relativity. Thus, a breakthrough in science was achieved by disregarding different operational definitions of scientific measurements and realizing that they both described a single theoretical concept. Einstein's disagreement with the operationalist approach was criticized by Bridgman as follows: \"Einstein did not carry over into his general relativity theory the lessons and insights he himself has taught us in his special theory.\" (p. 335).\n\nOperationalization is often used in the social sciences as part of the scientific method and psychometrics. Particular concerns about operationalization arise in cases that deal with complex concepts and complex stimuli (e.g., business research, software engineering) where unique threats to validity of operationalization are believed to exist.\n\nFor example, a researcher may wish to measure the concept \"anger.\" Its presence, and the depth of the emotion, cannot be directly measured by an outside observer because anger is intangible. Rather, other measures are used by outside observers, such as facial expression, choice of vocabulary, loudness and tone of voice; after Damasio, Lesion studies.\n\nIf a researcher wants to measure the depth of \"anger\" in various persons, the most direct operation would be to ask them a question, such as \"are you angry\", or \"how angry are you?\". This operation is problematic, however, because it depends upon the definition of the individual. Some people might be subjected to a mild annoyance, and become slightly angry, but describe themselves as \"extremely angry,\" whereas others might be subjected to a severe provocation, and become very angry, but describe themselves as \"slightly angry.\" In addition, in many circumstances it is impractical to ask subjects whether they are angry.\n\nSince one of the measures of anger is loudness, the researcher can operationalize the concept of anger by measuring how loudly the subject speaks compared to his normal tone. However, this must assume that loudness is uniform measure. Some might respond verbally while other might respond physically.\n\nOne of the main critics of operationalism in social science argues that \"the original goal was to eliminate the subjective mentalistic concepts that had dominated earlier psychological theory and to replace them with a more operationally meaningful account of human behavior. But, as in economics, the supporters ultimately ended up \"turning operationalism inside out\". \"Instead of replacing 'metaphysical' terms such as 'desire' and 'purpose'\" they \"used it to legitimize them by giving them operational definitions.\" Thus in psychology, as in economics, the initial, quite radical operationalist ideas eventually came to serve as little more than a \"reassurance fetish\" for mainstream methodological practice.\"\n\nThe above discussion links operationalization to measurement of concepts. Many scholars have worked to operationalize concepts like job satisfaction, prejudice, anger etc. Scale and index construction are forms of operationalization. There is not one perfect way to operationalize. For example, in the United States the concept distance driven would be operationalized as miles, whereas kilometers would be used in Europe.\n\nOperationalization is part of the empirical research process Take for example an empirical research question: Does job satisfaction influence job turnover? Both job satisfaction and job turnover need to be measured. The concepts and their relationship are important — operationalization occurs within a larger framework of concepts. When there is a large empirical research question or purpose the conceptual framework that organizes the response to the question must be operationalized before the data collection can begin. If a scholar constructs a questionnaire based on a conceptual framework, they have operationalized the framework. Most serious empirical research should involve operationalization that is transparent and linked to a conceptual framework.\n\nTo use an oversimplified example, the hypothesis \"Job satisfaction reduces job turnover\" is one way to connect (or frame) two concepts – job satisfaction and job turnover. The process of moving from the idea \"job satisfaction\" to the set of questionnaire items that form a job satisfaction scale is operationalization. For most of us, operationalization outside the larger issue of a research question and conceptual framework is just not very interesting.\n\nOperationalization uses a different logic when testing a formal (quantitative) hypothesis and testing working hypothesis (qualitative). For formal hypotheses the concepts are represented empirically (or operationalized) as numeric variables and tested using inferential statistics. Working hypotheses (particularly in the social and administrative sciences), on the other hand, are tested through evidence collection and the assessment of the evidence. The evidence is generally collected within the context of a case study. The researcher asks - Is the evidence sufficient to 'support' the working hypothesis? Formal operationalization would specify the kinds of evidence needed to support the hypothesis as well as evidence which would \"fail\" to support it. Robert Yin recommends developing a case study protocol as a way to specify the kinds of evidence needed during the data collection phases. He identifies six sources of evidence 1) documentation; 2) archival records; 3) interviews; 4) direct observations; 5) participant observation and 6) physical or cultural artifacts.\n\nIn the field of public administration, Shields and Tajalli (2006) have identified five kinds of conceptual frameworks (working hypothesis, descriptive categories, practical ideal type, operations research, and formal hypothesis). They explain and illustrate how each of these conceptual frameworks can be operationalized. They also show how to make conceptualization and operationalization more concrete by demonstrating how to form conceptual framework tables that are tied to the literature and operationalization tables that lay out the specifics of how to operationalize the conceptual framework (measure the concepts).\n\nFor examples of research projects that use conceptual framework and operationalization tables.\n"}

The Court wrote unanimously that \"unless there has been misrepresentation or fraud to secure consent to the treatment, a failure to disclose the attendant risks, however serious, should go to negligence rather than to battery.\" The case also marked the creation of a standard whereby a physician must give the patient sufficient information so that an objective, reasonable person in the patient's position would be able to make an informed choice about a medical procedure.\n\nRobert A. Hughes, a physician, was in the process of competently performing an endarterectomy on his patient, John Reibl, when Reibl suffered a massive stroke. Paralysis and impotence resulted. Reibl alleged that he had not truly given informed consent, and as such the surgery constituted battery. Although Reibl was aware that the surgery was not without risks, he felt that Hughes had implied that the risks of not having the surgery were greater. Reibl was eighteen months away from obtaining a lifetime pension, and the stroke prevented him from earning that pension. He stated that if he had been aware of the risks in the surgery, he would have waited the year and a half to earn his pension before undergoing the procedure, even if it meant a shortened life.\n\nIn the original trial, Reibl was awarded monetary damages for negligence and battery, irrespective of his having signed a formal consent form. On appeal to the Ontario Court of Appeal, the court directed that a new trial be held, but that the charge of battery be disallowed from the new proceedings.\n\nIt is a general principle in tort law that a defendant is not liable for damages unless their negligence was the \"cause\" of the injury to the plaintiff.\n\nIn the context of a medical malpractice claim where it is alleged the doctor failed to inform the patient of a risk, the doctor will not be held liable if the patient would have had the procedure anyway (even if they knew of the risk).\n\n\"Reibl v. Hughes\" the Supreme Court outlined a \"modified objective test\" for causation in medical malpractice. It is well established in Canadian law that a doctor cannot be sued for not disclosing information if the patient would have consented to the operation irrespective of whether or not the information was disclosed.\n\nConsider this example: your doctor knows that a surgery has a 5% chance of causing complete paralysis but does not tell you. Without the operation, however, you will very likely die within 12 months.\n\nThe court looked at two approaches: an objective test (\"what would a reasonable person do?\") and a subjective (\"what would this plaintiff have done?\"). There was concern that an objective test favors the doctor while a subjective test favors the plaintiff.\n\nIn an objective test, the Court would accept medical evidence that the chance of paralysis was 5% and the chance of death was high. A reasonable person, thinking rationally, would take the risk of paralysis over death.\n\nIf it were a subjective test, the Court would ask the plaintiff. Logically, the plaintiff, who is paralysed will say \"no.\" Logically, if the plaintiff said they would have had the operation anyway, they would not be suing the doctor.\n\nIn \"Reibl\", The Court created a \"modified objective test\" which starts with the \"reasonable person\" and adds some of the characteristics of the plaintiff, such as age, sex, and family circumstances but will not allow \"irrational beliefs\" to be taken into account.\n\nThe test has been frequently used to determine many medical malpractice and negligence cases, including Arndt v.

It regulates the statutory obligation to report deaths, injuries, diseases and \"dangerous occurrences\", including near misses, that take place at work or in connection with work.\nThe regulations require \"responsible persons\" to report deaths at work, major injuries caused by accidents at work, injuries to persons not at work that require hospital treatment, injuries arising from accidents in hospitals, and dangerous occurrences (reg.3(1)). Additionally, the law requires registered gas fitters to report poor and dangerous gas installations (reg.6).\n\nResponsible persons are generally employers but also include various managers and occupiers of premises (reg.2). Though the regulations do not impose a specific obligation on employees, they have a general obligation under section 7 of the Health and Safety at Work etc. Act 1974 to take care of safety. The Health and Safety Executive recommends that they report incidents to their employer and encourages voluntary notification to the relevant regulating authority.\n\nThere are specific regulations as to mines and quarries (reg.8/ Sch.5), and offshore installations (reg.9/ Sch.6).\n\nMedical treatments are exempt, as are injuries arising from road traffic accidents and to members of the armed forces (reg.10).\n\nBreach of the regulations is a crime, punishable on summary conviction with a fine of up to £400. If convicted on indictment in the Crown Court, an offender can be sentenced to an unlimited fine. Either an individual or a corporation can be punished and sentencing practice is published by the Sentencing Guidelines Council. For example, in 2000, Salford City Council were fined £115,000 for a breach of the regulations.\n\nIt is a defence that the responsible person was not aware of the event requiring reporting or notification and that he had taken all reasonable steps to have such events brought to his notice (reg.11). The burden of proof of such a defence is on the defendant, on the balance of probabilities.\n\nThe reporting of accidents and ill health at work has long been a legal requirement in the UK. The information enables the Health and Safety Executive (HSE) and local government authorities \"to identify where and how risks arise, and to investigate serious accidents\".\n\nDuring 2006-2007 about 30 million working days were lost due to work-related ill health, and 6 million due to workplace injury. In the same period, there were 141,350 incidents reported although it has been estimated that some 274,000 ought to have been reported. Further, 241 people were killed at work during this time. This figure obscures the fact that in 2005, 2037 people died from mesothelioma arising from previous exposure to asbestos and \"thousands more from other occupational cancers and lung diseases\".\n\nThe Regulations were intended to consolidate a number of earlier regulations on the reporting of accidents and diseases, generally in the workplace and specifically in the railway and offshore industries.\n\nNotification must be made by a responsible person to the relevant enforcing authority which is a body, possibly the local government authority, to which the HSE has delegated its powers. Notification must be made when any person, not necessarily an employee (reg.3):\n— or, when any person other than an employee suffers:\n— or, when an employee:\n— or, there is a dangerous occurrence.\n\n\"Accident\" includes assaults on employees and suicides on transport systems (reg.2). The report must be made by the \"quickest practicable means\" and confirmed by a written report within ten days (reg.3(2)). When an accident at work results in a reportable injury that, within a year of the accident, causes the death of the employee, the death itself must be reported, even if the accident and injury have already been reported (reg.4).\nOn occasions, an injury may caused a member of staff to be off work for more than seven working days, or prevent them from completing their normal work duties. If this situation arises then the company must notify the enforcing authority of the incident. When calculating the seven consecutive days, the day of the accident is not counted but the period after is, including weekends. For example, if an employee normally works Monday to Friday, is injured on a Tuesday and does not return to work until the following Thursday, then the incident will be required to be reported. This is because he/she will have been off work for eight days i.e. Wednesday to Wednesday inclusive.\n\n\"Major injuries\" are defined as (reg.2(1)/ Sch.1):\nDangerous occurrences that are reportable by all responsible persons are defined as (reg.2(1)/ Sch.2, Pt.1, paras.1-17):\n\nLifting machinery, etc. - Collapse, overturning, or failure of any load-bearing part of a lift or hoist, crane or derrick, mobile powered access platform, access or window cleaning cradle, excavator, pile-driving frame or rig taller than 7 metres, or forklift truck.\n\nPressure systems - Failure of a closed vessel, including a boiler or boiler tube, or of any associated pipework, in which the internal pressure was above or below atmospheric pressure, and the failure has the potential to cause death.\n\nFreight containers - Failure of a freight container in any of its load-bearing parts while it is being raised, lowered or suspended.\n\nOverhead electric lines - Unintentional incident in which plant or equipment either:\n\nElectrical short circuit - Electrical short circuit or overload accompanied by fire or explosion which results in the stoppage of the plant involved for more than 24 hours or which has the potential to cause death.\n\nExplosives - Various incidents with explosives.\n\nBiological agents - An accident or incident which resulted, or could have resulted, in release or escape of a biological agent likely to cause severe human infection or illness.\n\nMalfunction of radiation generators, etc. - Incident in which:\n\nBreathing apparatus - Malfunction of breathing apparatus while in use or in testing as a preliminary to use.\n\nDiving operations - Any of the following incidents during underwater diving:\n\nCollapse of scaffolding - Complete or partial collapse of a scaffold:\n— or the complete or partial collapse of the suspension arrangements, including any outrigger, of any slung or suspended scaffold that causes a working platform or cradle to fall.\n\nTrain collisions - Unintended collision of a train with any other train or vehicle, other than one reportable under Pt.4 of Sch.3 of the regulations, which caused, or might have caused, death or major injury.\n\nWells - Any of the following incidents in relation to a well, other than a water well:\n\nPipelines or pipeline works - The following incidents in respect of a pipeline or pipeline works:\n\nFairground equipment - The following incidents on fairground equipment, in use or under test:\n\nCarriage of dangerous substances by road tankers - Incident involving a road tanker or tank container used for the carriage of a dangerous substance in which:\n\nCarriage of dangerous substances by road in packages - Incident involving a vehicle used for the carriage of a dangerous substance in which:\n\nDangerous occurrences that are reportable by responsible persons, save in offshore workplaces, are defined as (reg.2(1)/ Sch.2, Pt.1, paras.18-21):\n\nCollapse of building or structure - Unintended collapse or partial collapse of:\n\nExplosion or fire - Explosion or fire, due to ignition of material, in any plant or premises that results in the stoppage of that plant, or as the case may be the suspension of normal work, for more than 24 hours.\n\nEscape of flammable substances - Sudden, uncontrolled release inside a building of:\n— or, in the open air, of 500 kilograms or more of a flammable liquid or gas.\n\nEscape of substances - Accidental release or escape of any substance in a quantity sufficient to cause death, major injury or any other damage to health.\n\nThere are also specific reporting requirements for mines (Sch.2/ Pt.2, paras.22-40), quarries (Sch.2/ Pt.3, paras.41-48), rail transport systems (Sch.2/ Pt.4, paras.49-72) and offshore installations (Sch.2/ Pt.5, paras.73-83).\n\nThe responsible person must make a report \"forthwith\" if he is notified by a registered medical practitioner that an employee is suffering from (reg.5/ Sch.3 Pt.1):\n\nCertain work related diseases contracted in offshore facilities must also be reported (reg.5/ Sch.3 Pt.2).\n\nReports must be made to the HSE within 14 days where there is, or is likely to be, incomplete combustion of gas, leaking gas or inadequate removal of the results of the combustion of gas (reg.6).\n\nThe responsible person, such as an employer, must keep records of reportable incidents and diseases, and other matters specified by the HSE to demonstrate compliance. Records are to be kept for 3 years, either at the place where the relevant work is carried out or at the responsible person's usual place of business. The enforcing authority may demand copies of such records (reg.7/ Sch.4).\n\n\n"}

The right to food and the right to housing have been further defined in human rights instruments. \n\nThe right to an adequate standard of living is enshrined in Article 25 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights (UDHR) and Article 11 of the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights. The most significant inspiration for the inclusion of the right to an adequate standard of living in the UDHR was the Four Freedoms speech by US President Franklin Roosevelt, which declared amongst others the \"freedom from want\". Fulfillment of the right to an adequate standard of living depends on a number of other economic, social and cultural rights, including the right to property, the right to work, the right to education and the right to social security. There have been a number of proposed policies to guarantee people a basic standard of living through the concept of offering a basic income guarantee essentially gifting all citizens a basic level of \"free money\" in order to meet basic needs such as food and shelter.\n\nThe most significant inspiration for the inclusion of the right to an adequate standard of living in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights (UDHR) was the 1941 Four Freedoms speech by US President Franklin Roosevelt, which declared freedom of speech, freedom of faith, freedom from want and freedom from fear. On the basis of the speech the American Law Institute established a draft proposals for an international bill of rights, the \"Statement of Essential Human Rights\", which greatly influenced the UDHR. The statement included the right to adequate food and housing and the right to social security, including the right to health. Article 25 of the UDHR recognises the right to an adequate standard of living, stating that:\n\n\"(1) Everyone has the right to a standard of living adequate for the health and well-being of himself and his family, including food, clothing, housing and medical care and necessary social services, and the right to security in the event of unemployment, sickness, disability, widowhood, old age or other lack of livelihood in circumstances beyond his control.\n(2) Motherhood and childhood are entitled to special care and assistance. All Children, whether born in or out of wedlock shall enjoy the same social protection.\"\n\nThe UDHR establishes that the realisation of the right to an adequate standard of living requires as a minimum the enjoyment of subsistence rights, that is adequate food and nutrition, clothing, housing and care when required. The UDHR recognises that the right to an adequate standard of living will require different measures depending on the situation of a person. It specifies that persons who are unable to secure the enjoyment of conditions necessary for an adequate standard of living have a right to care. Article 25 is closely related to Article 22 of the UDHR, which explicitly enshrines the right to social security. Article 25 also specifically mentions the rights of children born out of wedlock, which historically have been subject to discrimination.\n\nThe nature of the right to an adequate standard of living was further defined in Article 11 of the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights (ICESCR), which defines the right to an adequate standard of living in two paragraphs. Paragraph one states that:\n\n\"The States Parties to the present Covenant recognize the right of everyone to an adequate standard of living for himself and his family, including adequate food, clothing and housing, and to the continuous improvement of living conditions. The States Parties will take appropriate steps to ensure the realization of this right, recognizing to this effect the essential importance of international co-operation based on free consent.\"\n\nMedical care and health, which were included in the UDHR under the right to an adequate standard of living, were included in Article 12 of the ICESCR under the right to health. Rights relating to motherhood are recognised in Article 10 of the ICESCR on the protection of the family. When the ICESCR was drafted increased malnutrition was an urgent international concern, giving Article 11 an overall emphasis on food. Paragraph two of Article 11 states that:\n\n\"The States Parties to the present Covenant, recognizing the fundamental right of everyone to be free from hunger, shall take, individually and through international co-operation, the measures, including specific programmes, which are needed:\n(a) To improve methods of production, conservation and distribution of food by making full use of technical and scientific knowledge, by disseminating knowledge of the principles of nutrition and by developing or reforming agrarian systems in such a way as to achieve the most efficient development and utilization of natural resources;\n(b) Taking into account the problems of both food-importing and food-exporting countries, to ensure an equitable distribution of world food supplies in relation to need.\"\n\nAs such Article 11 of the ICESCR establishes two human rights, the right to be free from hunger, known as the right to food, and the right to an adequate standard of living, specifically in relation to subsistence rights to clothing, housing and food. The ICESCR requires as a minimum that the subsistence rights are protected by the state. The right to food and the right to housing have subsequently been defined as independent rights in other human rights instruments. Other aspects of the right to an adequate standard of living, such as the right to clothing have not received such attention, nor development. The ICESC makes it clear that states must take appropriate steps to ensure the realization of the right to an adequate standard of living, by for example requiring the state to take the necessary measures to ensure that hunger does not occur.\n\nThe right to an adequate standard of living is also enshrined in the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women, which aimed to create conditions under which women and mothers would be economically secure and independent. The Convention requires states to end discrimination against women in relation to employment and other economic activities. The right to an adequate standard of living is reiterated in the Convention on the Rights of the Child with Article 27 recognising ever child's right to a standard of living adequate for the child’s physical, mental, spiritual, moral and social development. The parents of the child have primary responsibility to secure this right within their abilities, while the state must take appropriate steps to assist parents and others responsible for children. States must if necessary provide material assistance, particularly in relation to nutrition, clothing and housing.\n\nOverall the right to an adequate standard of living is understood as a social right, which requires respect for a number of other economic, social and cultural rights, including the right to education as enshrined in Article 26 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights (UDHR) and Articles 13 and 14 of the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights (ICESCR), the right to property, which is enshrined in Article 17 of the UDHR, the right to work as enshrined in Article 23 of the UDHR and Article 6 of the ICESCR, and the right to social security as enshrined in Article 22 of the UDHR and Article 25 of the ICESCR. When the right to property, the right to work and the right to social security, three core economic rights, are implemented in combination, it is assumed that an adequate standard of living can normally be secured.\n\nThe right to private property was a crucial demand in early quests for political freedom and equality, and against feudal control of property. Property can serve as the basis for the entitlements that ensure the realisation of the right to an adequate standard of living. Initially only property owners were granted civil and political rights, such as the right to vote. The right to work was enshrined to allow those who do not own property to attain an adequate standard of living. Today discrimination on the basis of property ownership is recognised as a serious threat to the equal enjoyment of human rights by all and non-discrimination clauses in international human rights instruments frequently include property as a ground on the basis of which discrimination is prohibited (see the right to equality before the law).\n\n"}

Each year UFAR ensures the treatment of about one million people in what is referred to as the CDTI Kasongo project to prevent the further transmission of the parasitic disease onchocerciasis to uninfected persons and to halt the progression of the disease in those already infected.\n\nUnited Front Against Riverblindness was formed in 2004 and recognized as a 501c3 by the U.S. Internal Revenue Service. The organization was founded by and is currently led by Executive Director Dr. Daniel Shungu. UFAR has a small headquarters office in Lawrenceville, NJ and operational offices in Kinshasa and Kasongo, DRC. The CDTI Kasongo includes eight health zones.\n\nIn 2007 treatment was initiated in the health zone of Kasongo, in 2008 it was initiated in the health zones of Kunda, Lusangi, Salamabila and Samba, and in 2009 it was initiated in the remaining health zones of Kabambare, Kampene and Pangi.\n\nSince the community-wide mass treatment of all eligible people must be repeated once a year for 10–15 years, approximately three million tablets of Mectizan (ivermectin) were distributed in 2009 in all eight health zones by some 4,540 trained community workers.\n\nUFAR is governed by a volunteer board of directors that oversees the organization's activities and promotes its objectives and goals. The board is chaired by Jeffrey Yuan, PhD. The board includes members from medicine, academia and industry and includes: Daniel L. Shungu, PhD (Clinical Microbiology & Infectious Diseases), Roger Youmans, MD (Associate Executive Director, Surgeon & General Practitioner, Former Medical Missionary to DRC and Ghana, Author), Dr. Dennis Bowers (CEO of Life Force Technologies, Inc.), Mrs. Jean Jacobsohn (UFAR Treasurer), Dr. John McGlaughlin (Mathematics Instructor - Philadelphia School District), Dr. Elsie McKee (Church History, Historical Theology - Princeton Theological Seminary), Mr. Charles C. Phillips (Past-Chair, Information Technology, Resource Development, Isles, Inc.), Dr. Robin Rusciano (Political Science, Current Social World Issues - Rider University), Robert J. Vosatka, MD, Ph.D (Board Chair Emeritus, Physician, Teacher, Scientist), Jeffrey Yuan, PhD (Board Chair, Pharmaceutical Regulatory Affairs Scientist, Merck & Co., Inc.)\n\nAn advisory council includes private-sector professionals who lend their expertise in support of the United Front Against Riverblindness organization.\nExecutive Director Dr. Daniel Shungu manages the day-to-day operations and works with the field staff as well as APOC, WHO, the DRC Ministry of Health and other local and international public and private organizations that share in the mission of eradicating onchocerciasis.\n\nOnchocerciasis is a neglected tropical disease. The primary strategy to control onchocerciasis is to interrupt the life cycle of the parasite. Ivermectin, known by its trade name Mectizan, is the only drug available for treating onchocerciasis without severe side effects. The drug rapidly kills microfilariae (immature worms) but not the adult worms. A single oral dose of ivermectin, taken annually for the 10-15 year life span of the adult worms, protects individuals from further progression of onchocerciasis. Merck & Co. manufactures the drug and provides it free worldwide for the treatment of onchocerciasis.\n\nOnchocerciasis is a parasitic disease transmitted through the bite of the small black fly that breeds along the banks of fast-flowing rivers. People acquire the disease during their regular trips to infested rivers for their routine daily activities such as farming, hunting, fishing and fetching water. Larvae, transmitted to humans through the bite of the small black fly, mature under the skin into adult worms forming visible nodules throughout the body. Pairs of adult worms produce millions of microfilariae during their entire 10-15 year life span. The microfilariae initially cause a rash, severe itching, thickening and depigmentation of the skin, followed by visual impairment and eventually blindness.\n\nAnnual treatment requires annual training of community distributors (one distributor per 100-200 people), and requires that trained local medical staff be on hand during the annual treatment phase for handling any treatment-related severe adverse reactions.\n\nEight health zones and 116 health centers comprise the CDTI Kasongo region. The people are served by three hospitals and there are 136 medical doctors and nurses in the region. More than 1,700 villages, ranging in size from 100 to more than 65,000 people, are included in the CDTI Kasongo.\n\nThe Community Directed Treatment with Ivermectin (CDTI) program is the strategy whereby people in endemic communities are empowered to play a major role in managing their own health. CDTI has been adopted worldwide as the primary method for mass distribution of Mectizan to control onchocerciasis. UFAR works with these adult volunteers in partnership with APOC, the World Health Organization, and the Democratic Republic of the Congo national government.\n\nCommunities choose their own community distributors. These village-based volunteers serve as health care workers who are trained to take full control of the ivermectin treatment program in their respective communities. The training includes providing accurate basic information on the disease and the drug in the local languages, instructions on taking the census, ordering and collecting ivermectin from the health center, preparing and conducting community-wide distribution of the drug, submitting treatment reports back to the health center, and monitoring and reporting any unusual adverse reactions. Such active community involvement greatly improves both the therapeutic and the geographic coverage of ivermectin mass distribution programs.\n\nEffective treatment includes more than distribution of medicine. It also requires education to address long-held myths about the causes of onchocerciasis. This educational process begins with enlisting the cooperation and participation of the village chief and tribal elders.\n\nThe United Front Against Riverblindness (UFAR) announces a landmark partnership with Sightsavers, an international development charity. Sightsavers will fund riverblindness prevention and elimination in two remote areas of the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC). More than 1.2 million people and 2,728 villages will be added to UFAR's existing program.\n\nDr. Daniel Shungu, founder of UFAR, says that UFAR will now be able to bring lifesaving medicine to Ituri Nord and Lubutu, in Oriental and Maniema provinces, respectively. \"I thank Sightsavers on behalf of UFAR and especially for those in the two new regions whose lives will be positively changed forever as a result of this arrangement. We have a few more challenges to face but, fortunately, finances for these two projects will not be one of them,\" he says.\n\n\nGeneral:\n\n"}

Improvements were also seen in left ventricular diastolic dimension and left atrial dimension.\n\nPatients with aortic stenosis, obstructive hypertrophic cardiomyopathy and ischemic cardiomyopathies should not use Waon therapy as a treatment. Prohibiting patients with ischemic cardiomyopathies prevents an increase in temperature from further activating the sympathetic nervous system, which could cause tachycardia in these patients.\n\nWaon therapy increases blood flow by stimulating endothelial nitric oxide synthase protein production (eNOS). eNOS makes nitric oxide, which is a vasodilator and increases blood flow. Waon therapy also increases blood flow by stimulating the mobilization endothelial progenitor cells marked with CD34 molecules. CD34 positive cells promote angiogenesis to increase blood flow, improving cardiac perfusion and decreasing vascular resistance. Nitric oxide is also a regulator of the sympathetic nervous system, and an increase of nitric oxide via endothelial nitric oxide synthase may help to control autonomic nervous system.\n\nIn chronic heart failure the sympathetic nervous system is over-activated and the parasympathetic nervous system depressed, increasing stress on the heart. Waon therapy increases parasympathetic activity and decreases the sympathetic activity. These changes decrease stress on the heart by decreasing systemic resistance and increasing cardiac output, which decrease preload and afterload.\n\nBrain natriuretic peptide (BNP) decreases with Waon therapy. BNP is a negative indicator of cardiac function and is released during ventricular stretching.\n\nA 5 year study of Waon therapy showed a decrease in cardiac death and rehospitalisation after cardiac events. This treatment is currently only being used in Japan, but positive results suggest Waon therapy may be a new, non-pharmacological treatment for chronic heart failure patients and other vascular resistance diseases.\n\n"}
