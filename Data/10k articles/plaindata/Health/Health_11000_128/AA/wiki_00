Agricultural economics began as a branch of economics that specifically dealt with land usage, it focused on maximizing the crop yield while maintaining a good soil ecosystem. Throughout the 20th century the discipline expanded and the current scope of the discipline is much broader. Agricultural economics today includes a variety of applied areas, having considerable overlap with conventional economics. Agricultural economists have made substantial contributions to research in economics, econometrics, development economics, and environmental economics. Agricultural economics influences food policy, agricultural policy, and environmental policy.\n\nEconomics has been defined as the study of resource allocation under scarcity. Agricultural economics, or the application of economic methods to optimizing the decisions made by agricultural producers, grew to prominence around the turn of the 20th century. The field of agricultural economics can be traced out to works on land economics. Henry Charles Taylor was the greatest contributor with the establishment of the Department of Agricultural Economics at Wisconsin in 1909.\n\nAnother contributor, 1979 Nobel Economics Prize winner Theodore Schultz, was among the first to examine development economics as a problem related directly to agriculture. Schultz was also instrumental in establishing econometrics as a tool for use in analyzing agricultural economics empirically; he noted in his landmark 1956 article that agricultural supply analysis is rooted in \"shifting sand\", implying that it was and is simply not being done correctly.\n\nOne scholar summarizes the development of agricultural economics as follows:\n\n\"Agricultural economics arose in the late 19th century, combined the theory of the firm with marketing and organization theory, and developed throughout the 20th century largely as an empirical branch of general economics. The discipline was closely linked to empirical applications of mathematical statistics and made early and significant contributions to econometric methods. In the 1960s and afterwards, as agricultural sectors in the OECD countries contracted, agricultural economists were drawn to the development problems of poor countries, to the trade and macroeconomic policy implications of agriculture in rich countries, and to a variety of production, consumption, and environmental and resource problems.\"\n\nAgricultural economists have made many well-known contributions to the economics field with such models as the cobweb model, hedonic regression pricing models, new technology and diffusion models (Zvi Griliches), multifactor productivity and efficiency theory and measurement, and the random coefficients regression. The farm sector is frequently cited as a prime example of the perfect competition economic paradigm.\n\nIn Asia, agricultural economics was offered first by the University of the Philippines Los Baños Department of Agricultural Economics in 1919. Today, the field of agricultural economics has transformed into a more integrative discipline which covers farm management and production economics, rural finance and institutions, agricultural marketing and prices, agricultural policy and development, food and nutrition economics, and environmental and natural resource economics.\n\nSince the 1970s, agricultural economics has primarily focused on seven main topics, according to a scholar in the field: agricultural environment and resources; risk and uncertainty; food and consumer economics; prices and incomes; market structures; trade and development; and technical change and human capital.\n\nIn the field of environmental economics, agricultural economists have contributed in three main areas: designing incentives to control environmental externalities (such as water pollution due to agricultural production), estimating the value of non-market benefits from natural resources and environmental amenities (such as an appealing rural landscape), and the complex interrelationship between economic activities and environmental consequences. With regard to natural resources, agricultural economists have developed quantitative tools for improving land management, preventing erosion, managing pests, protecting biodiversity, and preventing livestock diseases.\n\nWhile at one time, the field of agricultural economics was focused primarily on farm-level issues, in recent years agricultural economists have studied diverse topics related to the economics of food consumption. In addition to economists' long-standing emphasis on the effects of prices and incomes, researchers in this field have studied how information and quality attributes influence consumer behavior. Agricultural economists have contributed to understanding how households make choices between purchasing food or preparing it at home, how food prices are determined, definitions of poverty thresholds, how consumers respond to price and income changes in a consistent way, and survey and experimental tools for understanding consumer preferences.\n\nAgricultural economics research has addressed diminishing returns in agricultural production, as well as farmers' costs and supply responses. Much research has applied economic theory to farm-level decisions. Studies of risk and decision-making under uncertainty have real-world applications to crop insurance policies and to understanding how farmers in developing countries make choices about technology adoption. These topics are important for understanding prospects for producing sufficient food for a growing world population, subject to new resource and environmental challenges such as water scarcity and global climate change.\n\nDevelopment economics is broadly concerned with the improvement of living conditions in low-income countries, and the improvement of economic performance in low-income settings. Because agriculture is a large part of most developing economies, both in terms of employment and share of GDP, agricultural economists have been at the forefront of empirical research on development economics, contributing to our understanding of agriculture's role in economic development, economic growth and structural transformation. Many agricultural economists are interested in the food systems of developing economies, the linkages between agriculture and nutrition, and the ways in which agriculture interact with other domains, such as the natural environment.\n\nThe International Association of Agricultural Economists (IAAE) is a worldwide professional association, which holds its major conference every three years. The association publishes the journal \"Agricultural Economics\". There also is a European Association of Agricultural Economists (EAAE), an African Association of Agricultural Economists [AAAE]and an Australian Agricultural and Resource Economics Society. Substantial work in agricultural economics internationally is conducted by the International Food Policy Research Institute.\n\nIn the United States, the primary professional association is the Agricultural & Applied Economics Association (AAEA), which holds its own annual conference and also co-sponsors the annual meetings of the Allied Social Sciences Association (ASSA). The AAEA publishes the \"American Journal of Agricultural Economics\" and \"Applied Economic Perspectives and Policy\".\n\nGraduates from agricultural and applied economics departments find jobs in many sectors of the economy: agricultural management, agribusiness, commodities markets, education, the financial sector, government, natural resource and environmental management, real estate, and public relations. Careers in agricultural economics require at least a bachelor's degree, and research careers in the field require graduate-level training. A 2011 study by the Georgetown Center on Education and the Workforce rated agricultural economics tied for 8th out of 171 fields in terms of employability.\n\n\n"}

CNA/NNOC has a four-member Council of Presidents, currently including Deborah Burger, RN; Zenei Cortez, RN; DeAnn McEwen, RN; and Malinda Markowitz, RN. The executive director of the CNA/NNOC is Bonnie Castillo.\n\nThe California Nurses Association is well known for its long history of advocacy for direct care registered nurses and patient care protections.\n\nUnder RoseAnn DeMoro's leadership, CNA gained attention for its sponsorship of landmark legislative and regulatory reforms, including the nation's first mandated registered nurse-to-patient ratios in California which were sponsored by CNA. The ratio law, which requires hospitals to maintain a minimum number of nurses in all hospital units at all times to assure patient safety, was signed in 1999 by then-California Gov. Gray Davis. The ratios were implemented in 2004. When California Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger sought to roll back key portions of the law in late 2004 at the request of the California hospital industry, CNA led a successful year-long campaign to challenge Schwarzegger and protect the law.\n\nA subsequent study evaluated the effect on outcomes for nurses and patients by comparing outcomes in California in the subsequent two years with those of New Jersey and Pennsylvania — two similar states without such mandates. There was substantial compliance with the mandate in California, with over 80% compliance rates reported across several different units of surveyed hospitals; equivalent levels of non-mandated compliance in the comparator states were considerably lower, at 19%, 52%, and 63% compliance in medical/surgical, pediatric, and intensive care units (ICUs) in New Jersey and 33%, 66%, and 71% in Pennsylvania. After extensive adjustment for patient and hospital characteristics, the study revealed statistically significant relationships between the nurse-to-patient ratio and 30-day mortality and failure to rescue (FTR — that is, failure to prevent a clinically-important deterioration, such as death or permanent disability, from a complication of an underlying illness or of medical care) in all three states. In particular, for every additional patient added to a nurse's workload, the odds of patient death increased by in 13% California, 10% in New Jersey, and by a factor of 6% in Pennsylvania after adjusting for these factors. Across all three states, facilities with nurse-to-patient ratios consistent with those mandated in California were associated with lower rates of nursing burnout, and nurses reported consistently better quality of care.\n\nCNA was also the principal sponsor of numerous other items of legislation promoting patient safety, including laws requiring whistle-blower protection for hospital employees who report unsafe conditions, barring discrimination based on medical conditions or genetic characteristics, safeguards on who can provide telephone medical advice, and expanded legal protections for patients harmed by health maintenance organization (HMO) abuses.\n\nAdditionally, CNA won changes in state regulations to assure that every patient be assessed by a registered nurse and limiting unsafe assignment of RNs to work in hospital areas for which they do not have clinical expertise.\n\nCNA/NNOC has drawn national attention for campaigns on behalf of patients denied medical treatment recommended by their physicians.\n\nThe CNA/NNOC is a primary national organizational advocate of the United States National Health Care Act (HR 676). The bill would establish a single-payer national public health care insurance plan, essentially an improved equal-treatment Medicare for all Americans.\n\nOn June 19, 2008, CNA/NNOC joined with other health care, labor, and community activists, and patients in sponsoring a day of protest against the insurance industry in 19 cities across the U.S. calling for enactment of HR 676.\n\nA California Field Poll in April 2008 found that CNA has the highest favorable rating among all groups, politicians, and institutions involved in public policy debates over health care reform in the state.\n\nOn May 9, 2008, the Public Broadcasting Service television show with Bill Moyers featured a segment on CNA/NNOC describing a campaign conducted by the organization saying all Americans should be entitled to the same level of care available to Vice President Dick Cheney and members of Congress. \n\nThe growing achievements of CNA and NNU received much national attention in 2010.\nA profile of CNA and DeMoro in \"Business Week\", July 22, 2010, noted, \"Under DeMoro, the union threw itself into the broader fight for patients' rights in the face of consolidation in hospital chains and insurers. The NNU simply takes that fight national, says DeMoro.\" \"The Washington Post\", November 20, 2010 described \"an aggressive strategy by a national nurses union, experts say: Its members are growing in numbers, and they have not been afraid to walk picket lines.\" The San Francisco Chronicle, in an article headlined, \"Nurses union becomes potent political force,\" November 24, 2010, wrote, \"The Oakland-based California Nurses Association has made its mark by delivering some powerful political punches with a combination of entertaining theater and savvy strategizing.\"\n\nThe California Nurses Association was formed in 1903 as the California State Nurses Association.\n\nCNA was the first nurses union in the U.S. to win collective bargaining contracts for nurses when Shirley Carew Titusadvocated for agreements with the East Bay Hospital Conference for minimum salaries, time-and-a-half pay for overtime, shift differentials for night and weekend work, a 40-hour work week, paid holidays, vacations, and sick leave, and employer-paid health insurance.\n\nIn 1976, California established the first-in-the-nation requirements for safe RN staffing by adopting a CNA-sponsored law requiring no more than two patients per RN in intensive care units.\n\nIn 1992-1993, CNA established a new model for nursing organizations and unions in response to corporate hospital industry changes that resulted in reduced patient care standards and growing replacement of RNs with unlicensed staff, and the domination of most nursing organizations by nursing executives. Responding to growing demands for forceful protections for nurses and patients by the 90 percent of CNA members who were provided direct patient care, the CNA administration fired 13 CNA staff, including then-collective bargaining director Rose Ann DeMoro, and suspended four top leaders of the elected union arm of CNA. In response, CNA nurses staged a staff nurse revolt, building broad support among California nurses, winning a legal challenge to re-instate the fired staff and suspended leaders, and electing the first staff nurse majority on the CNA board. In September, 1993, the new staff nurse majority took office, and hired DeMoro as CNA Executive Director.\n\nIn 1994, CNA began an aggressive challenge to hospital restructuring plans by opposing reductions in care standards, holding educational workshops for nurses across the state, and establishing a national \"Patient Watch\" program to assist patients harmed by unsafe hospital practices.\n\nIn 1995, CNA withdrew from the nurse executive dominated American Nurses Association, a pattern later followed by other state nurses associations.\n\nFrom 1997-1998, CNA waged a major battle with HMO giant Kaiser Permanente over its efforts to force sweeping contract concessions on RNs with strikes by 7,500 RNs at 47 Kaiser hospitals and clinics in Northern and Central California, and a successful campaign to oppose Kaiser hospital closures in Oakland, Richmond, and Martinez.\n\nIn 1999, CNA culminated a long campaign by winning passage of a landmark law, the first in the nation, requiring minimum RN-to-patient staffing ratios in all hospital units.\n\nFrom 2001-2003, CNA won numerous union elections, especially in large hospital chains run by Catholic Healthcare West and Tenet Healthcare.\n\nIn 2004, CNA founded the National Nurses Organizing Committee in response to the requests of direct care RNs across the nation for a stronger voice to improve RN and patient care standards. The CNA website [May 10, 2008] claims the group is the fastest-growing union in the United States, adding that 80,000 RNs are currently members of CNA/NNOC.\n\nIn April 2008, the CNA/NNOC clashed with SEIU over an agreement between SEIU and Catholic Healthcare Partners of Ohio. CNA/NNOC labeled the election a \"sham.\" SEIU and Catholic Healthcare Partners cancelled the election for 8,000 workers in 9 Ohio hospitals on whether to have SEIU representation. NNOC contends that the agreement fits SEIU's pattern of forging controversial agreements with employers that sacrifice public protections and workplace standards in exchange for more members. The conflict continued until March, 2009, when CNA/NNOC and SEIU announced that the unions would cooperate to organize hospital employees, with nurses joining the nurses union and other hospital staff joining the SEIU.\n\nNational Nurses United established\nOn February 18, 2009, CNA/NNOC announced that it is joining with two other nurses unions, the Massachusetts Nurses Association and the United American Nurses, to create a 150,000-member union. The organization is called National Nurses United and is affiliated with the AFL-CIO. Deborah Burger, co-president of CNA/NNOC said that the new group is intended to give registered nurses a national voice and more organizing strength.\n\nOn December 7, 2009, CNA joined with the Massachusetts Nurses Association and United American Nurses to found National Nurses United, the largest union and professional association of registered nurses in U.S. history. In its founding convention in Phoenix, NNU delegates pledged to:\n\n\nIn its first year, NNU cited many accomplishments, including:\n\n\nOn January 3, 2013, the CNA joined forces with the National Union Of Healthcare Workers (NUHW) to form a new union, NUHW-CNA. Part of the motivation regarding the affiliation was the 2013 election for 43.000 Kaiser service and tech workers represented at the time by CNA rival, SEIU-UHW. Despite CNA support, SEIU-UHW won the election and the partnership between CNA and NUHW eventually ended.\n\nCNA supports he Inclusive Prosperity Act (H.R. 1144/S. 434 Ellison) otherwise known as the Robin Hood Tax, which would place a tax on the sale of stocks,bonds and derivatives, and the single payer bill HR676 (Conyers) which would set up a government-run, non-profit health insurance system covering all US residents. CNA was also the first labor union to endorse Senator Bernie Sanders' presidential run in 2016/17.\n\n"}

An example case mix might be male patients under the age of 50, who present with a myocardial infarction and also undergo emergency coronary artery bypass surgery.\n\nAt a local level, such as a single hospital; the data within a case mix may relate to the activity of an individual consultant, a specific speciality or a particular unit (such as a ward). On a wider level; it is possible to compare the case mix of hospitals, regions, and even countries. Whilst a case mix will often include a condition or diagnosis, as well as any treatment received; it can also include demographics, such as gender or age, and a specific time range.\n\nConditions and treatments are often captured using a medical classification system, such as ICD-10, in a process called clinical coding. The practice of coding, essentially groups patients using statistical codes. The coded data can be grouped further into Diagnosis-Related Groups (DRGs), which are used in the billing process by hospitals and practices; as the \"cost per item\" of healthcare is based on the casemix.\n\nPrior to the introduction of nationally consistent Activity Based Funding (ABF) by the Commonwealth Government, Casemix based funding was the key funding model used in Australian health care services for reimbursement of the cost of patient care.\n\nIn the Netherlands, the casemix system is called a \"DBC\" (Dutch:\"Diagnosebehandelcombinatie\"), and can be defined as a predefined average care package, which is applied with a fixed price when a specific diagnosis occurs.\n\nCasemix is a system that measures hospital performance, aiming to reward initiatives that increase efficiency in hospitals. It also serves as an information tool that allows policy makers to understand the nature and complexity of health care delivery.\n\nDiagnosis-Related Groups (DRGs) is the best-known classification system that is used in this funding model. It classifies acute inpatient episodes into a number of manageable categories based on clinical condition and resource consumption. A single acute episode of inpatient care is allocated to one DRG using coded clinical information derived from the patient’s medical record. This information is coded by the Health Information Managers in order to allocate a DRG. Each DRG is allocated a ‘weight’, which is dependent on the average cost of inputs (e.g. nursing, diagnostic services, procedures) required to achieve the appropriate patient outcome. The facility is reimbursed a predetermined amount for each patient episode.\n\nThe casemix system introduces a kind of Activity Based Costing to the health profession. However the complexities of the system (in the Netherlands, over 100,000 DBC's can be theoretically charged) has led new initiatives to link billable activities directly to international standards, such as the ICD-10. This will eventually allow the billing processes to become more aligned in their classification schemes with the electronic patient record.\n\nBecause mental health treatment does not lend itself to fixed price costing, other exceptions are made by insurance companies for payment in the case of longer term casemix averages.\n\nCase mix group\n"}

This treatment can be used by people with delayed sleep phase disorder who generally cannot reset their circadian rhythm by moving their bedtime and rising time earlier.\n\nHere's an example of how chronotherapy could work over a week's course of treatment, with the patient going to sleep 3 hours later every day until the desired sleep and waketime is reached.\n\n\nWhile this technique can provide respite from sleep deprivation for people who must wake early for school or work, the new sleep and wake times can only be maintained by following a strictly disciplined timetable for sleeping and rising.\n\nA modified chronotherapy is called controlled sleep deprivation with phase advance, SDPA. One stays awake one whole night and day, then goes to bed 90 minutes \"earlier\" than usual and maintains the new bedtime for a week. This process is repeated weekly until the desired bedtime is reached.\n\nSometimes, although extremely infrequently, \"reverse\" chronotherapy – i.e., gradual movements of bedtime and rising time \"earlier\" each day – has been used in treatment of patients with abnormally short circadian rhythms, in an attempt to move their bedtimes to \"later\" times of the day. Because circadian rhythms substantially shorter than 24 hours are extremely rare, this type of chronotherapy has remained largely experimental.\n\nThe safety of chronotherapy is not fully known. While chronotherapy has been successful for some, it is necessary to rigidly maintain the desired sleep/wake cycle thenceforth. Any deviation in schedule tends to allow the body clock to shift later again.\n\nChronotherapy has been known to cause non-24-hour sleep–wake disorder in at least three recorded cases, as reported in the \"New England Journal of Medicine\" in 1992.

According to the Criminal Investigation and Detection Group (CIDG), the notorious suspects of the murder, Espinosa was killed during a shootout that he initiated when the CIDG came to the jail to serve him a search warrant. Espinosa's death occurred amid allegations that he was involved in the drug trade by President Rodrigo Duterte, who initiated the Philippine Drug War intending to kill criminals using or distributing drugs. The Commission on Human Rights and Karapatan have held Duterte accountable for Espinosa's death, with Senate condemning the death as an instance of extrajudicial killing.\n\nRolando Espinosa was a Filipino politician who served as mayor of Albuera, Leyte. He was elected to the position in the May 2016 Philippine elections. Espinosa's campaign focused on combating illegal drugs.

The Philippine National Police has alleged that his son Kerwin Espinosa is involved in the illegal drug trade.\n\nOn August 1, 2016, Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte, who was conducting a nationwide campaign against illegal drugs, asked Espinosa and his son Kerwin to surrender themselves within 24 hours \"on the grounds of drug-trafficking and coddling.\" Duterte said that the police would arrest and possibly shoot them if they resisted arrest. Fearing for his life, Espinosa voluntarily surrendered himself at Camp Crame to Philippine National Police (PNP) Director General Ronald Dela Rosa on Aug 2. Espinosa admitted that his son Kerwin was involved in the illegal drug trade in Eastern Visayas and urged Kerwin, who had a standing arrest warrant, to surrender himself to authorities. However, Espinosa denied using money from illegal drugs to finance his election campaign. He agreed to undergo drug testing and was turned over to the Criminal Investigation and Detection Group. At the time of his arrest, the mayor did not have a standing arrest warrant.\n\nAt 5:30 a.m (UTC +8) on August 3, the police had a shootout with twelve armed men with alleged links to Espinosa in Barangay Benolho in Albuera. Six of the men were killed, and of \"shabu\" (methamphetamine) worth , along with some firearms, were seized.\n\nOn August 4, 2016, CIDG Region 8 and the Albuera Police Station filed criminal charges against the Espinosas.\n\nOn August 6, Espinosa, along with his daughter and wife, left the PNP director general's residence in Camp Crame and went back to Leyte.\n\nOn August 7, Duterte announced a list of government officials, police officers, and law practitioners who were allegedly involved in the illegal drug trade in the country. Espinosa was included in Duterte's list.\n\nEspinosa resumed work as mayor on August 16.\n\nOn August 24, 2016, Espinosa went to the police to seek custody due to threats to his life. Espinosa promised to reveal his son's connections. Three days later, the police took Espinosa into custody. On October 5, Espinosa was arrested for alleged possession of illegal drugs when the police found at least of methamphetamine at the Espinosa ancestral home in Albuerra.\n\nEspinosa was brought to the Baybay City Regional Trial Court, which ordered him to be detained at the Baybay City Provincial Jail. In October, he was charged with illegal drug possession by the regional trial court. He was also brought to the Western Leyte Provincial Hospital where he underwent a medical examination.\n\nJudge Tarcelo Sabarre Jr. of the Regional Trial Court Branch 30 issued two search warrants against Rolando Espinosa and Raul Yap, who was also suspected of being involved in illegal drugs, at the Baybay City Provincial Jail in Barangay Hipusngo. The Criminal Investigation and Detection Group (CIDG) of Region 8, led by Police Chief Inspector Leo Laraga, served the warrants in the early morning of November 5, 2016. According to the CIDG, Espinosa and Yap first shot at the CIDG operatives, resulting in a shootout between the two men and the CIDG. Espinosa and Yap died in the alleged firefight.\n\nThe Bagong Alyansang Makabayan expressed concerns over strong indications that the death of Espinosa was a \"cold-blooded murder,\" saying that the circumstances of his death were highly questionable. They urged the relief of CIDG operatives involved in the incident as well as of the CIDG Section 8 leadership, pending a \"thorough and impartial\" investigation. The group also said that those implicated in the list of alleged drug lords may take advantage of Espinosa's killing. They urged Duterte to condemn Rolando Espinosa's killing and labeled the incident as a setback for the president's war on drugs.\n\nThe Commission on Human Rights and Karapatan also called for people involved in Espinosa's death to be held accountable. Karapatan in particular linked the police to \"narcopolitics\" and alleged that the CIDG conducted a \"rubout\".\n\nFollowing the incident, Senator Panfilo Lacson called for the possible resumption of the Senate inquiry into deaths related to the Philippine war on drugs. He labeled the incident as a \"clear case of extrajudicial killing\" and as the \"biggest challenge to the credibility of the PNP\". Lacson alleged that there was a cover-up for \"bigger personalities\" and questioned why the CIDG, instead of a court sheriff, was sent, since Espinosa was already detained. He also alleged that Yap was killed so that there would be no witnesses.\n\nPNP Chief Ronald Dela Rosa ordered an investigation of the incident, promising that there would be no cover-up. On the same day as the CIDG operation, operatives arrived at the crime scene where they were apprised of a Super Caliber .38 pistol, a magazine of live ammunition, a small heat-sealed sachet of suspected methamphetamine, and drug paraphernalia in Espinosa's cell.\n\nA panel led by the Regional Director Chief Superintendent of region 8, a certain Beltejar, was formed to investigate the incident. The Regional Internal Affairs Service also planned to conduct a separate investigation.\n\nVideo footage of the CIDG operations was found to be missing. An autopsy on Espinosa's body revealed that he was shot four times, with one bullet managing to exit the body. The findings of the study also raised the possibility that Espinosa may have been lying down when he was shot dead. Two of his expensive rings were also found to be missing. The bullets were sent to the regional crime laboratory for further investigation.\n\nThe National Bureau of Investigation (NBI) also became involved in the case. In December 2016, the agency concluded that the death of Rolando Espinosa was a result of a rubout. It recommended the filing of murder and perjury charges against police personnel involved in the operation. The NBI described the arrest warrants, which served as the basis for the operation, as having been \"maliciously obtained\". It noted that Paul Olendan, whose perjured affidavit the warrant was based on, was in Leyte National High School in Tacloban at the time he claimed to have visited the Baybay Jail. The NBI added that there had been an anti-contraband operation on October 30, 2016 in the jail where Espinosa was detained, and that enforcers only found cellphones during that operation.\n\nEspinosa was buried at the Catholic Cemetery in Albuera, Leyte on December 3, 2016, following a requiem mass at the Saint James Parish Church. His funeral procession was attended by 1,500 people.\n\n"}

{"id": "58751479", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=58751479", "title": "Electronic health records in the United States", "text": "Electronic health records in the United States\n\nFederal and state governments, insurance companies and other large medical institutions are heavily promoting the adoption of electronic health records. The US Congress included a formula of both incentives (up to $44,000 per physician under Medicare, or up to $65,000 over six years under Medicaid) and penalties (i.e. decreased Medicare and Medicaid reimbursements to doctors who fail to use EMRs by 2015, for covered patients) for EMR/EHR adoption versus continued use of paper records as part of the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health (HITECH) Act, enacted as part of the, American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009.\n\nThe 21st Century Cures Act, passed in 2016, prohibited information blocking, which had slowed interoperability. In 2018, the Trump administration announced the MyHealthEData initiative to further allow for patients to receive their health records. The federal Office of the National Coordinator for Health Information Technology leads these efforts.\n\nOne VA study estimates its electronic medical record system may improve overall efficiency by 6% per year, and the monthly cost of an EMR may (depending on the cost of the EMR) be offset by the cost of only a few \"unnecessary\" tests or admissions. Jerome Groopman disputed these results, publicly asking \"how such dramatic claims of cost-saving and quality improvement could be true\". A 2014 survey of the American College of Physicians member sample, however, found that family practice physicians spent 48 minutes more per day when using EMRs. 90% reported that at least 1 data management function was slower after EMRs were adopted, and 64% reported that note writing took longer. A third (34%) reported that it took longer to find and review medical record data, and 32% reported that it was slower to read other clinicians' notes.\n\nEven though Electronic health records systems with a computerized provider order entry (CPOE) have existed for more than 30 years, fewer than 10 percent of hospitals as of 2006 had a fully integrated system.\n\nIn a 2008 survey by DesRoches et al. of 4484 physicians (62% response rate), 83% of all physicians, 80% of primary care physicians, and 86% of non-primary care physicians had no EHRs. \"Among the 83% of respondents who did not have electronic health records, 16%\" had bought, but not implemented an EHR system yet.\nThe 2009 National Ambulatory Medical Care Survey of 5200 physicians (70% response rate) by the National Center for Health Statistics showed that 51.7% of office-based physicians did not use any EMR/EHR system.\n\nIn the United States, the CDC reported that the EMR adoption rate had steadily risen to 48.3 percent at the end of 2009. This is an increase over 2008, when only 38.4% of office-based physicians reported using fully or partially electronic medical record systems (EMR) in 2008. However, the same study found that only 20.4% of all physicians reported using a system described as minimally functional and including the following features: orders for prescriptions, orders for tests, viewing laboratory or imaging results, and clinical progress notes. As of 2013, 78 percent of office physicians are using basic electronic medical records. As of 2014, more than 80 percent of hospitals in the U.S.have adopted some type of EHR. Though within a hospital, the type of EHR data and mix varies significantly. Types of EHR data used in hospitals include structured data (e.g., medication information) and unstructured data (e.g., clinical notes).\n\nThe healthcare industry spends only 2% of gross revenues on HIT, which is low compared to other information intensive industries such as finance, which spend upwards of 10%.\n\nThe usage of electronic medical records can vary depending on who the user is and how they are using it. Electronic medical records can help improve the quality of medical care given to patients. Many doctors and office-based physicians refuse to get rid of the traditional paper records. Harvard University has conducted an experiment in which they tested how doctors and nurses use electronic medical records to keep their patients' information up to date. The studies found that electronic medical records were very useful; a doctor or a nurse was able to find a patient's information fast and easy just by typing their name; even if it was misspelled. The usage of electronic medical records increases in some work places due to the ease of use of the system; whereas the president of the Canadian Family Practice Nurses Association says that using electronic medical records can be time consuming, and it isn't very helpful due to the complexity of the system. Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center reported that doctors and nurses prefer to use a much more friendly user software due to the difficulty and time it takes for a medical staff to input the information as well as to find a patients information. A study was done and the amount of information that was recorded in the EMRs was recorded; about 44% of the patients information was recorded in the EMRs. This shows that EMRs are not very efficient most of the time.\n\nThe cost of implementing an EMR system for smaller practices has also been criticized; data produced by the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation demonstrates that the first year investment for an average five person practice is $162,000 followed by about $85,000 in maintenance fees. Despite this, tighter regulations regarding meaningful use criteria and national laws (Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act and the Affordable Care Act) have resulted in more physicians and facilities adopting EMR systems:\n\n\nBeyond financial concerns there are a number of legal and ethical dilemmas created by increasing EMR use, including the risk of medical malpractice due to user error, server glitches that result in the EMR not being accessible, and increased vulnerability to hackers.\n\nElectronic medical records, like other medical records, must be kept in unaltered form and authenticated by the creator. Under data protection legislation, the responsibility for patient records (irrespective of the form they are kept in) is always on the creator and custodian of the record, usually a health care practice or facility. This role has been said to require changes such that the sole medico-legal record should be held elsewhere. The physical medical records are the property of the medical provider (or facility) that prepares them. This includes films and tracings from diagnostic imaging procedures such as X-ray, CT, PET, MRI, ultrasound, etc. The patient, however, according to HIPAA, has a right to view the originals, and to obtain copies under law.\n\nThe Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act (HITECH) (,§2.A.III & B.4) (a part of the 2009 stimulus package) set meaningful use of interoperable EHR adoption in the health care system as a critical national goal and incentivized EHR adoption. The \"goal is not adoption alone but 'meaningful use' of EHRs—that is, their use by providers to achieve significant improvements in care.\"\n\nTitle IV of the act promises maximum incentive payments for Medicaid to those who adopt and use \"certified EHRs\" of $63,750 over 6 years beginning in 2011. Eligible professionals must begin receiving payments by 2016 to qualify for the program. For Medicare the maximum payments are $44,000 over 5 years. Doctors who do not adopt an EHR by 2015 will be penalized 1% of Medicare payments, increasing to 3% over 3 years. In order to receive the EHR stimulus money, the HITECH Act requires doctors to show \"meaningful use\" of an EHR system. As of June 2010, there were no penalty provisions for Medicaid.\n\nIn 2017 the government announced its first False Claims Act settlement with an electronic health records vendor for misrepresenting its ability to meet “meaningful use” standards and therefore receive incentive payments. eClinicalWorks paid $155 million to settle charges that it had failed to meet all government requirements, failed to adequately test its software, failed to fix certain bugs, failed to ensure data portability, and failed to reliably record laboratory and diagnostic imaging orders. The government also alleged that eClinicalWorks paid kickbacks to influential customers who recommended its products. The case marks the first time the government applied the federal Anti-Kickback Statute law to the promotion and sale of an electronic health records system. The False Claims Act lawsuit was brought by a whistleblower who was a New York City employee implementing eClinicalWorks’ system at Rikers Island Correctional Facility when he became aware of the software flaws. His “qui tam” case was later joined by the government. Notably, CMS has said it will not punish eClinicalWorks clients that \"in good faith\" attested to using the software.\n\nHealth information exchange (HIE) has emerged as a core capability for hospitals and physicians to achieve \"meaningful use\" and receive stimulus funding. Healthcare vendors are pushing HIE as a way to allow EHR systems to pull disparate data and function on a more interoperable level.\n\nStarting in 2015, hospitals and doctors will be subject to financial penalties under Medicare if they are not using electronic health records.\n\n\nStudies call into question whether, in real life, EMRs improve the quality of care. 2009 produced several articles raising doubts about EMR benefits. A major concern is the reduction of physician-patient interaction due to formatting constraints. For example, some doctors have reported that the use of check-boxes has led to fewer open-ended questions.\n\nThe main components of meaningful use are:\nIn other words, providers need to show they're using certified EHR technology in ways that can be measured significantly in quality and in quantity.\n\nThe meaningful use of EHRs intended by the US government incentives is categorized as follows:\n\n\nThe Obama Administration's Health IT program intends to use federal investments to stimulate the market of electronic health records:\n\n\nThe detailed definition of \"meaningful use\" is to be rolled out in 3 stages over a period of time until 2017. Details of each stage are hotly debated by various groups.\n\nThe first steps in achieving meaningful use are to have a certified electronic health record (EHR) and to be able to demonstrate that it is being used to meet the requirements. Stage 1 contains 25 objectives/measures for Eligible Providers (EPs) and 24 objectives/measures for eligible hospitals. The objectives/measures have been divided into a core set and menu set. EPs and eligible hospitals must meet all objectives/measures in the core set (15 for EPs and 14 for eligible hospitals). EPs must meet 5 of the 10 menu-set items during Stage 1, one of which must be a public health objective.\n\nFull list of the Core Requirements and a full list of the Menu Requirements.\n\nCore Requirements:\n\n\nMenu Requirements:\n\n\nTo receive federal incentive money, CMS requires participants in the Medicare EHR Incentive Program to \"attest\" that during a 90-day reporting period, they used a certified EHR and met Stage 1 criteria for meaningful use objectives and clinical quality measures. For the Medicaid EHR Incentive Program, providers follow a similar process using their state's attestation system.\n\nThe government released its final ruling on achieving Stage 2 of meaningful use in August 2012. Eligible providers will need to meet 17 of 20 core objectives in Stage 2, and fulfill three out of six menu objectives. The required percentage of patient encounters that meet each objective has generally increased over the Stage 1 objectives.\n\nWhile Stage 2 focuses more on information exchange and patient engagement, many large EHR systems have this type of functionality built into their software, making it easier to achieve compliance. Also, for those eligible providers who have successfully attested to Stage 1, meeting Stage 2 should not be as difficult, as it builds incrementally on the requirements for the first stage.\n\nOn March 20, 2015 CMS released its proposed rule for Stage 3 meaningful use. These new rules focus on some of the tougher aspects of Stage 2 and require healthcare providers to vastly improve their EHR adoption and care delivery by 2018.\n\nThe price of EMR and provider uncertainty regarding the value they will derive from adoption in the form of return on investment have a significant influence on EMR adoption. In a project initiated by the Office of the National Coordinator for Health Information, surveyors found that hospital administrators and physicians who had adopted EMR noted that any gains in efficiency were offset by reduced productivity as the technology was implemented, as well as the need to increase information technology staff to maintain the system.\n\nThe U.S. Congressional Budget Office concluded that the cost savings may occur only in large integrated institutions like Kaiser Permanente, and not in small physician offices. They challenged the Rand Corporation's estimates of savings.\n\nOffice-based physicians in particular may see no benefit if they purchase such a product—and may even suffer financial harm. Even though the use of health IT could generate cost savings for the health system at large that might offset the EMR's cost, many physicians might not be able to reduce their office expenses or increase their revenue sufficiently to pay for it. For example. the use of health IT could reduce the number of duplicated diagnostic tests. However, that improvement in efficiency would be unlikely to increase the income of many physicians. ...Given the ease at which information can be exchanged between health IT systems, patients whose physicians use them may feel that their privacy is more at risk than if paper records were used.\n\nDoubts have been raised about cost saving from EMRs by researchers at Harvard University, the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania, Stanford University, and others.\n\nIn a survey by DesRoches et al. (2008), 66% of physicians without EHRs cited capital costs as a barrier to adoption, while 50% were uncertain about the investment. Around 56% of physicians without EHRs stated that financial incentives to purchase and/or use EHRs would facilitate adoption. In 2002, initial costs were estimated to be $50,000–70,000 per physician in a 3-physician practice. Since then, costs have decreased with increasing adoption. A 2011 survey estimated a cost of $32,000 per physician in a 5-physician practice during the first 60 days of implementation.\n\nOne case study by Miller et al. (2005) of 14 small primary-care practices found that the average practice paid for the initial and ongoing costs within 2.5 years. A 2003 cost-benefit analysis found that using EMRs for 5 years created a net benefit of $86,000 per provider.\n\nSome physicians are skeptical of the positive claims and believe the data is skewed by vendors and others with an interest in EHR implementation.\n\nBrigham and Women's Hospital in Boston, Massachusetts, estimated it achieved net savings of $5 million to $10 million per year following installation of a computerized physician order entry system that reduced serious medication errors by 55 percent. Another large hospital generated about $8.6 million in annual savings by replacing paper medical charts with EHRs for outpatients and about $2.8 million annually by establishing electronic access to laboratory results and reports.\n\nMaintenance costs can be high. Miller et al. found the average estimated maintenance cost was $8500 per FTE health-care provider per year.\n\nFurthermore, software technology advances at a rapid pace. Most software systems require frequent updates, often at a significant ongoing cost. Some types of software and operating systems require full-scale re-implementation periodically, which disrupts not only the budget but also workflow. Costs for upgrades and associated regression testing can be particularly high where the applications are governed by FDA regulations (e.g. Clinical Laboratory systems). Physicians desire modular upgrades and ability to continually customize, without large-scale reimplementation.\n\nTraining of employees to use an EHR system is costly, just as for training in the use of any other hospital system. New employees, permanent or temporary, will also require training as they are hired.\n\nIn the United States, a substantial majority of healthcare providers train at a VA facility sometime during their career. With the widespread adoption of the Veterans Health Information Systems and Technology Architecture (VistA) electronic health record system at all VA facilities, fewer recently-trained medical professionals will be inexperienced in electronic health record systems. Older practitioners who are less experienced in the use of electronic health record systems will retire over time.\n\nThe Healthcare Information and Management Systems Society, a very large U.S. health care IT industry trade group, observed that EMR adoption rates \"have been slower than expected in the United States, especially in comparison to other industry sectors and other developed countries. A key reason, aside from initial costs and lost productivity during EMR implementation, is lack of efficiency and usability of EMRs currently available.\" The U.S. National Institute of Standards and Technology of the Department of Commerce studied usability in 2011 and lists a number of specific issues that have been reported by health care workers. The U.S. military's EMR \"AHLTA\" was reported to have significant usability issues.\n\nIn the United States, there are no standards for semantic interoperability of health care data; there are only syntactic standards. This means that while data may be packaged in a standard format (using the pipe notation of HL7, or the bracket notation of XML), it lacks definition, or linkage to a common shared dictionary. The addition of layers of complex information models (such as the HL7 v3 RIM) does not resolve this fundamental issue.\n\nAs of 2018, Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources was a leading interoperability standard, and the Argonaut Project is a privately sponsored interoperability initiative.\n\nIn 2017, Epic Systems announced Share Everywhere, which lets providers access medical information through a portal; their platform was described as \"closed\" in 2014, with competitors sponsoring the CommonWell Health Alliance.\n\nThe economics of sharing have been blamed for the lack of interoperability, as limited data sharing can help providers retain customers.\n\nIn the United States, the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) has the largest enterprise-wide health information system that includes an electronic medical record, known as the Veterans Health Information Systems and Technology Architecture (VistA). A key component in VistA is their VistA imaging System which provides a comprehensive multimedia data from many specialties, including cardiology, radiology and orthopedics. A graphical user interface known as the Computerized Patient Record System (CPRS) allows health care providers to review and update a patient's electronic medical record at any of the VA's over 1,000 healthcare facilities. CPRS includes the ability to place orders, including medications, special procedures, X-rays, patient care nursing orders, diets, and laboratory tests.\n\nThe 2003 National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) ensured that the VA and DoD would work together to establish a bidirectional exchange of reference quality medical images. Initially, demonstrations were only worked in El Paso, Texas, but capabilities have been expanded to six different locations of VA and DoD facilities. These facilities include VA polytrauma centers in Tampa and Richmond, Denver, North Chicago, Biloxi, and the National Capitol Area medical facilities. Radiological images such as CT scans, MRIs, and x-rays are being shared using the BHIE. Goals of the VA and DoD in the near future are to use several image sharing solutions (VistA Imaging and DoD Picture Archiving & Communications System (PACS) solutions).\n\nClinical Data Repository/Health Data Repository (CDHR) is a database that allows for sharing of patient records, especially allergy and pharmaceutical information, between the Department of Veteran Affairs (VA) and the Department of Defense (DoD) in the United States. The program shares data by translating the various vocabularies of the information being transmitted, allowing all of the VA facilities to access and interpret the patient records. The Laboratory Data Sharing and Interoperability (LDSI) application is a new program being implemented to allow sharing at certain sites between the VA and DoD of \"chemistry and hematology laboratory tests\". Unlike the CHDR, the LDSI is currently limited in its scope.\n\nOne attribute for the start of implementing EHRs in the States is the development of the Nationwide Health Information Network which is a work in progress and still being developed. This started with the North Carolina Healthcare Information and Communication Alliance founded in 1994 and who received funding from Department of Health and Human Services.\n\nThe Department of Veterans Affairs and Kaiser Permanente has a pilot program to share health records between their systems VistA and HealthConnect, respectively. This software called 'CONNECT' uses Nationwide Health Information Network standards and governance to make sure that health information exchanges are compatible with other exchanges being set up throughout the country. CONNECT is an open source software solution that supports electronic health information exchange. The CONNECT initiative is a Federal Health Architecture project that was conceived in 2007 and initially built by 20 various federal agencies and now comprises more than 500 organizations including federal agencies, states, healthcare providers, insurers, and health IT vendors.\n\nThe US Indian Health Service uses an EHR similar to Vista called RPMS. VistA Imaging is also being used to integrate images and co-ordinate PACS into the EHR system. In Alaska, use of the EHR by the Kodiak Area Native Association has improved screening services and helped the organization reach all 21 clinical performance measures defined by the Indian Health Service as required by the Government Performance and Results Act.\n\nIn the United States in 2011 there were 380 major data breaches involving 500 or more patients' records listed on the website kept by the United States Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) Office for Civil Rights. So far, from the first wall postings in September 2009 through the latest on 8 December 2012, there have been 18,059,831 \"individuals affected,\" and even that massive number is an undercount of the breach problem. The civil rights office has not released the records of tens of thousands of breaches it has received under a federal reporting mandate on breaches affecting fewer than 500 patients per incident.\n\nPrivacy concerns in healthcare apply to both paper and electronic records. According to the \"Los Angeles Times\", roughly 150 people (from doctors and nurses to technicians and billing clerks) have access to at least part of a patient's records during a hospitalization, and 600,000 payers, providers and other entities that handle providers' billing data have some access also. Recent revelations of \"secure\" data breaches at centralized data repositories, in banking and other financial institutions, in the retail industry, and from government databases, have caused concern about storing electronic medical records in a central location. Records that are exchanged over the Internet are subject to the same security concerns as any other type of data transaction over the Internet.\n\nThe Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) was passed in the US in 1996 to establish rules for access, authentications, storage and auditing, and transmittal of electronic medical records. This standard made restrictions for electronic records more stringent than those for paper records. However, there are concerns as to the adequacy of these standards.\n\nIn the United States, information in electronic medical records is referred to as Protected Health Information (PHI) and its management is addressed under the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) as well as many local laws. The HIPAA protects a patient's information; the information that is protected under this act are: information doctors and nurses input into the electronic medical record, conversations between a doctor and a patient that may have been recorded, as well as billing information. Under this act there is a limit as to how much information can be disclosed, and as well as who can see a patient's information. Patients also get to have a copy of their records if they desire, and get notified if their information is ever to be shared with third parties. Covered entities may disclose protected health information to law enforcement officials for law enforcement purposes as required by law (including court orders, court-ordered warrants, subpoenas) and administrative requests; or to identify or locate a suspect, fugitive, material witness, or missing person.\n\nMedical and health care providers experienced 767 security breaches resulting in the compromised confidential health information of 23,625,933 patients during the period of 2006–2012.\n\nOne major issue that has risen on the privacy of the US network for electronic health records is the strategy to secure the privacy of patients. Former US president George W. Bush called for the creation of networks, but federal investigators report that there is no clear strategy to protect the privacy of patients as the promotions of the electronic medical records expands throughout the United States. In 2007, the Government Accountability Office reports that there is a \"jumble of studies and vague policy statements but no overall strategy to ensure that privacy protections would be built into computer networks linking insurers, doctors, hospitals and other health care providers.\"\n\nThe privacy threat posed by the interoperability of a national network is a key concern. One of the most vocal critics of EMRs, New York University Professor Jacob M. Appel, has claimed that the number of people who will need to have access to such a truly interoperable national system, which he estimates to be 12 million, will inevitable lead to breaches of privacy on a massive scale. Appel has written that while \"hospitals keep careful tabs on who accesses the charts of VIP patients,\" they are powerless to act against \"a meddlesome pharmacist in Alaska\" who \"looks up the urine toxicology on his daughter's fiance in Florida, to check if the fellow has a cocaine habit.\" This is a significant barrier for the adoption of an EHR. Accountability among all the parties that are involved in the processing of electronic transactions including the patient, physician office staff, and insurance companies, is the key to successful advancement of the EHR in the US Supporters of EHRs have argued that there needs to be a fundamental shift in \"attitudes, awareness, habits, and capabilities in the areas of privacy and security\" of individual's health records if adoption of an EHR is to occur.\n\nAccording to \"The Wall Street Journal\", the DHHS takes no action on complaints under HIPAA, and medical records are disclosed under court orders in legal actions such as claims arising from automobile accidents. HIPAA has special restrictions on psychotherapy records, but psychotherapy records can also be disclosed without the client's knowledge or permission, according to the \"Journal\". For example, Patricia Galvin, a lawyer in San Francisco, saw a psychologist at Stanford Hospital & Clinics after her fiance committed suicide. Her therapist had assured her that her records would be confidential. But after she applied for disability benefits, Stanford gave the insurer her therapy notes, and the insurer denied her benefits based on what Galvin claims was a misinterpretation of the notes.\n\nWithin the private sector, many companies are moving forward in the development, establishment and implementation of medical record banks and health information exchange.\nBy law, companies are required to follow all HIPAA standards and adopt the same information-handling practices that have been in effect for the federal government for years. This includes two ideas, standardized formatting of data electronically exchanged and federalization of security and privacy practices among the private sector.\nPrivate companies have promised to have \"stringent privacy policies and procedures.\" If protection and security are not part of the systems developed, people will not trust the technology nor will they participate in it. There is also debate over ownership of data, where private companies tend to value and protect data rights, but the patients referenced in these records may not have knowledge that their information is being used for commercial purposes.\n\nIn 2013, reports based on documents released by Edward Snowden revealed that the NSA had succeeded in breaking the encryption codes protecting electronic health records, among other databases.\n\nIn 2015, 4.5 million health records were hacked at UCLA Medical Center.\n\nIn 2018, Social Indicators Research published the scientific evidence of 173,398,820 (over 173 million) individuals affected in USA from October 2008 (when the data were collected) to September 2017 (when the statistical analysis took place).\n\nIn the United States, reimbursement for many healthcare services is based upon the extent to which specific work by healthcare providers is documented in the patient's medical record. Enforcement authorities in the United States have become concerned that functionality available in many electronic health records, especially copy-and-paste, may enable fraudulent claims for reimbursement. The authorities are concerned that healthcare providers may easily use these systems to create documentation of medical care that did not actually occur.\nThese concerns came to the forefront in 2012, in a joint letter from the U.S. Departments of Justice and Health and Human Services to the American hospital community. The American Hospital Association responded, focusing on the need for clear guidance from the government regarding permissible and prohibited conduct using electronic health records. In a December 2013 audit report, the U.S. HHS Office of the Inspector General (OIG) issued an audit report reiterating that vulnerabilities continue to exist in the operation of electronic health records. The OIG's 2014 Workplan indicates an enhanced focus on providers' use of electronic health records.\n\nThe Security Rule, according to Health and Human Services (HHS), establishes a security framework for small practices as well as large institutions. All covered entities must have a written security plan. The HHS identifies three components as necessary for the security plan: administrative safeguards, physical safeguards, and technical safeguards.\n\nHowever, medical and healthcare providers have experienced 767 security breaches resulting in the compromised confidential health information of 23,625,933 patients during the period of 2006–2012.\n\nThe Health Insurance Portability and Accessibility Act requires safeguards to limit the number of people who have access to personal information. However, given the number of people who may have access to your information as part of the operations and business of the health care provider or plan, there is no realistic way to estimate the number of people who may come across your records. Additionally, law enforcement access is authorized under the act. In some cases, medical information may be disclosed without a warrant or court order.\n\nThe Security Rule that was adopted in 2005 did not require breach notification. However, notice might be required by state laws that apply to a variety of industries, including health care providers. In California, a law has been in place since 2003 requiring that a HIPAA covered organization's breach could have triggered a notice even though notice was not required by the HIPAA Security Rule. Since 1 January 2009, California residents are required to receive notice of a health information breach.\n\nFederal law and regulations now provide rights to notice of a breach of health information. The Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health (HITECH) Act requires HHS and the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) to jointly study and report on privacy and data security of personal health information. HITECH also requires the agencies to issue breach notification rules that apply to HIPAA covered entities and Web-based vendors that store health information electronically. The FTC has adopted rules regarding breach notification for internet-based vendors.\n\n"}

The system consists of a number of private ambulance companies, each with its own designated service area within one of fifteen service delivery regions, and with standards of operation that are provided by the government contract. All contracts stipulate that the contractor is required to meet all standards published for vehicles, equipment, training, and performance by the Dutch Ambulance Institute. All contracts for EMS in the Netherlands are sent to tender every four years, with the contract being awarded to the most successful applicants. Netherlands law forbids EMS systems to earn any profit; any surplus revenue is required to be directed to additional improvements to the system, including training, equipment, and vehicles. The Dutch system is a rare exception to the rule in Europe, in that it operates on a variation of the Anglo-American model of EMS care, and not on the Franco-German model, followed by the majority of European countries.\nThe government of the Netherlands contracts for air ambulance service, which is provided by four helicopters, all of which are in service around the clock. These helicopters are strategically located around the country to minimize response times. Air units may perform high-acuity inter-facility transfers, or may also respond to the location where an emergency is occurring, to assist with immediate care or facilitate rapid transport of high-acuity victims.. All air ambulance helicopters are staffed by both nurse and physicians. The primary role of the helicopters is the rapid delivery of the Mobile Medical Team, and transport of the patient by aircraft, while possible, is not the preferred outcome. In some cases, particularly for response to offshore emergencies, the civilian air ambulance system is supplemented by the three helicopters of the Search and Rescue service of the Netherlands Coastguard; using assets provided by the Dutch Navy and Dutch Air Force services. All of these helicopters are transport-capable. Some areas of Holland also receive emergency air ambulance service from helicopters or vehicles based in Belgium and Germany, since these locations are beyond the normal flight range of the Dutch-owned aircraft.\n\nSince 1992, Dutch law has mandated at least one nurse on every ambulance in the country, at all times. The nurses employed on ambulances have all completed the full training required for a registered nurse in the Netherlands, and have then completed additional training and certification in anaesthesia, intensive care, cardiac care, or emergency room, to apply for an additional year of training to qualify as a Registered Ambulance Nurse. All \"paramedics\" in the Netherlands are nurses. The term ‘paramedic’ is not used in the Dutch system. As a result of this measure, all Dutch ambulances and rapid response vehicles are capable of providing Advanced Life Support (ALS) without online medical control. The exceptional level of training permits what is, for the most part, independent practice, conducted according to a set of National Emergency Care Protocols, issued by the Dutch Ambulance Institute, and reviewed and revised every four years. Medical oversight for protocol compliance is conducted by each service's Medical Manager, who is a licensed physician. On those occasions when the patient's condition actually exceeds the paramedic protocols, the paramedic has the option of either calling their own Medical Manager for additional instructions, or requesting the response of a mobile medical team.\n\nAll ambulances are staffed by a crew of two. These include one nurse, with the training and skill set described above, and one dedicated driver. The medical training of the driver is minimal, and that individual is minimal permitted to participate in patient care with assisting the nurse. Mobile medical teams (MMT) are generally staffed by a senior surgical resident or anesthesiologist with additional training to function in the prehospital environment and additional nurses. MMT aircraft are designed for team delivery, not medical transport. Transport is usually accomplished by means of the ambulance that originated the call, with the team on board. In case of weather that restricts flight operations, each MMT is also equipped with a special van for land response.\n\nThe Netherlands government mandates that all ambulances must meet the standards outlined by the Netherlands Ambulance Institute, in addition to the European standard CEN 1789, as published by the European Committee for Standards. These standards are applied to the types of vehicles and the types of medical equipment required. However, the Dutch system does not comply with all of the elements of the visual identity program beyond the basic colors of vehicles and warning systems, and has no plans to comply with the marking schemes standards. In addition to conventional ambulances, in some areas, particularly those subject to urban traffic congestion, some Dutch paramedics also use ALS equipped motorcycles as Rapid Response Vehicles.\n\nAll 25 EMS regions in the Netherlands are self-dispatching. Some regions have more than one centre, but all are interconnected. The technologies involved in the dispatch of EMS resources are generally equivalent to the American and British standards. All EMS dispatch centers participate in the national emergency number scheme. The emergency telephone number for ambulances in the Netherlands is 112. All EMS calls in the Netherlands are nurse-triaged. Triage is conducted using national evidence-based triage protocols and guidelines developed by the Dutch Ambulance Institute. Most dispatch centers use computer-based decision-support systems. As a result of this approximately 30 percent of all requests for service are dealt with by some other means of service at the scene, and in approximately 40 percent of cases, the call is triaged with a result that an ambulance response is avoided entirely.\n\nDutch law provides support for all standards published by the Netherlands Ambulance Institute, which currently mandates that an ambulance must be in place on the scene of any emergency in the country within 15 minutes. That standard is currently being met approximately 95 percent of the time.\n\n"}

{"id": "47075289", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=47075289", "title": "Fecal sludge management", "text": "Fecal sludge management\n\nFecal sludge management (FSM) (or faecal sludge management in British English) is the collection, transport, and treatment of fecal sludge from pit latrines, septic tanks or other onsite sanitation systems. Fecal sludge is a mixture of human excreta, water and solid wastes (e.g. toilet paper or other anal cleansing materials, menstrual hygiene materials) that are disposed in pits, tanks or vaults of onsite sanitation systems. Fecal sludge that is removed from septic tanks is called septage. \n\nFSM is necessary in densely populated areas where a proportion of population is not connected to a sewerage network, and the covering and rebuilding pit latrines is not possible. This is the case in most urban areas of developing countries, but such services are also used in developed countries where sewerage systems are unavailable. FSM services are usually provided by formal and informal private sector services providers, local governments, water authorities and utilities. However, in many developing countries FSM services are often unavailable or if they are available are often informal, unregulated, unhygienic and unsafe. This can lead to surface water and groundwater pollution, spreading of pathogens into the environment and adverse public health impacts. It can also result in unreliable services with relatively high costs to the households which need them.\n\nFecal sludge collection services can be made available on a scheduled basis or on a call-for-service basis (also known as on-demand, on-request or non-scheduled services). The collected fecal sludge may be transported to treatment plants by using a vacuum truck; a tank and pump mounted on a flatbed truck; a small tank pulled by a motorcycle; or in containers on a hand cart. Mobile or permanent transfer stations can be used to improve the efficiency of fecal sludge transportation by transferring the waste to larger tankers for haulage to treatment. The wider use of multiple decentralized sludge treatment facilities within the city (to avoid long haulage distances) is currently being researched and piloted.\n\nThe collected fecal sludge should preferably be processed at dedicated fecal sludge treatment plants, instead of being co-treated with sewage in municipal sewage treatment plants, unless these are able to take the additional load, and facilities to separate liquids and solids are available. A variety of mechanized and non-mechanized processing technologies may be used, including constructed wetlands, anaerobic digestion, and waste stabilization ponds. The treatment process can produce useful products such as treated effluent that can be used for irrigation. Another possibility is to use the treated fecal sludge after composting as a soil conditioner or for the production of biogas, charcoal, biodiesel, powdered industrial fuel and electricity. Historically, the term night soil was used for fecal sludge. \n\nFecal sludge management (FSM) requires safe and hygienic septic tank and pit latrine emptying services, along with the effective treatment of solids and liquids and the reuse of treated produce where possible. It may include a range of options including on-site and offsite treatment, and the dispersal or capture and further processing of the products of the treatment process into such as biogas, compost and energy.\n\nFSM is used synonymously with the term \"septage management\", but they are not the same. Septage is a specific type of fecal sludge: it is the partially digested fecal solids that accumulates in septic tanks. Fecal sludge from pit latrines may have a lower water content compared to septage and may contain more solid waste. \n\nPit latrines generate fecal sludge, and these are sometimes classified as dry toilets, although wet pits are also common, especially in Asia. However, other types of dry toilets - those that are designed to be easily emptied, without the addition of water - do not generate fecal sludge but dried feces (in the case of urine-diverting dry toilets) or compost (in the case of composting toilets), for example. In the case of Arborloo toilets, nothing is ever extracted from the pit and, instead, the lightweight outhouse/superstructure is moved to another shallow hole and a tree is planted on top of the filled hole.\n\nCollectively, the collection, transport, treatment and reuse of excreta constitute the \"value chain\" of fecal sludge management.\n\nIn India some government policy documents are using the term FSSM for \"Fecal sludge and septage management\".\n\nSeptage or \"septic tank sludge\" is partially treated sludge that is accumulated and stored in a septic tank or similar onsite sewage facility. Septage is a by-product from the pretreatment of household wastewater (sewage) in a septic tank. After a few years of accumulation, septage is usually pumped out of a septic tank by a vacuum truck. Septic tanks are receiving blackwater from flush toilets, as well as greywater. This means that septage only contains the kind of solid waste that can be flushed, such as toilet paper. Septage may also include \"scum\", which is material that floats at the top and contains fats, oil and grease as well as any floating solid waste. \n\nThe term \"septage\" has been used in the United States since at least 1992. It has also been used in projects by the United States Agency for International Development in Asia. Another definition of septage is: \"A historical term to define sludge removed from septic tanks.\"\n\nSeptage waste is periodically removed (with a frequency depending on tank capacity, system efficiency, and usage level, but typically less often than annually) from the septic tanks by specialized vehicles known as vacuum truck. They pump the septage out of the tank, and transport it to a local sewage treatment plant. It could also be used by farmers for fertilizer, or stored in large septage waste storage facilities for later treatment or use on crops.\n\nWorldwide there is an increasing interest and awareness of FSM issues, particularly in Africa and Asia. This is evidenced by some large-scale research and development projects in the area of FSM. Such research is being carried out and funded by many organizations, and also at scale by the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation.\n\nIn many developing countries, fecal sludge is not properly managed. This may be due to a lack of mandated institutions and little awareness of the impact of poor sanitation; the lack of technical expertise and experience; inability to source funds for to purchase of vacuum trucks and treatment, or lack of knowledge required to be initiate and implement successful FSM programs. This can result in the poor performance of onsite sanitation facilities (OSSFs), septic tank and pit latrine overflows, unsafe emptying of pit latrines, and the dumping of untreated pathogenic fecal sludge into the environment.\n\nGoal 6 of the Sustainable Development Goals for (water and) sanitation has helped to increase awareness of the risks of poor sanitation management along the entire sanitation chain. It has provided a motivation to many countries, cities and organizations to improve the range of improved sanitation services available. Among these are FSM programs to: \n\nFSM programs can be drivers of sanitation improvement in different ways. They can encourage OSSF upgrades that reduce (or increase) the frequency of desludging and therefore the operational and environmental costs. They can also be drivers of economic development all along the sanitation value chain. This can include provision of materials and parts for new toilets and septic tanks; contractors and equipment installers; sludge collection personal including drivers and emptiers; treatment and reuse systems operators; and production and sale of the end-products of the sludge treatment process.\n\nThese products may include recycled water for agriculture and industry, soil conditioners, biogas, biodiesel or electricity. There are many pilot, demonstration and full-scale FSM programs now operating in Asia and Africa, but few that have demonstrated a sustained impact upon the value chain.\n\nFSM services can be provided as demand based (often called on-request, on-call, on-demand, ad-hoc or non-scheduled) or scheduled (also known as regular) desludging, or a combination of both. Under either mechanism, OSSFs are desludged on a periodic basis or when the household requests it or due to inspection by a competent authority indicates desludging is needed.\n\nAn analysis of 20 FSM Innovation Case Studies and research and advocacy of successful programs carried out by Oxfam Philippines has demonstrated that common elements for successful FSM programs include:\n\nFecal sludge (FS) is the human waste, wastewater, trash and debris that accumulates in pit latrines and septic tanks or other onsite sanitation systems. Fecal sludge is an offensive material that contains pathogens, can generate odors and cause surface water pollution, as well as groundwater pollution. Characteristics of fecal sludge may vary widely due to climate, toilet type, diet and other variables. Performing a waste characterization study to understand local conditions provides data that factors into treatment plant sizing, as well as estimating the value of the products that can be derived from the treatment process.\n\nThe main physico-chemical parameters commonly measured to characterize fecal sludge include: BOD, total suspended solids, % solids, indication of sand, COD, ammonium, total nitrogen and total phosphorus, Fats, Oil and Grease (FOG), Sludge Volume Index (SVI), pH, alkalinity.\n\nSystem designers often use default values, such as 2,000 mg/l for BOD and 5,000 mg/l of TSS (which might be an average country-wide) in order to size the treatment system. If no such data exists, or if local conditions are not adequately reflected in assumed values, a waste characterization study can be conducted.\n\nRelatively little data exists on pathogen content in fecal sludge. One study from rural Bangladesh determined 41 helminth eggs per g of fecal sludge from pit latrines.\n\nThe characteristics of fecal sludge may be influenced by:\nMore research into conducting waste characterization studies in developing countries is needed. For developed countries, more data is available.\n\nFSM is a critical sanitation service in cities and towns in all countries where households use onsite sanitation systems. Citywide FSM programs may utilize multiple or one treatment facility, use stationary and mobile transfer stations, and engage with micro, small and medium-sized enterprises that may conduct some or all of the services. Programs may be phased in over time to accommodate growing demand.\n\nPeri urban areas are often less densely populated than urban centers. Therefore they have more space and on-site sanitation systems can be effective for solid and liquid treatment. In most such peri-urban areas, it is less likely that they will be connected to a conventional centralized sanitary sewer system in the short or medium term. Therefore, these areas will rely on a mix of onsite-sanitation systems and services, decentralized wastewater management systems, or by condominial or simplified sewerage connected to decentralized or centralized treatment. In all of these situations, FSM is a necessary service to keep the sanitation systems functioning properly.\n\nRural areas with low population density may not need formal FSM services if the local practice is to cover and rebuild latrines when they fill up. However, this if is not possible, rural areas often lack treatment facilities within a reasonable (say 30 minutes drive) distance; are difficult for tankers to access and often have limited demand for emptying making transport and treatment uneconomic, and unaffordable for most people. Therefore options such as relocating latrines on-site, double (alternating) pit or Arborloo toilets could be considered. Also sharing decentralized FSM services and sludge treatment between nearby villages, or direct safe removal burial of waste could be considered and organized.\n\nFSM services are usually provided by formal and informal private sector service providers, local governments, water authorities and utilities. Water utilities with a high percentage of water connectivity (homes with piped water connections) are logical operators of FSM programs. If water is sold to customers through a tariff, an additional tariff to cover FSM services may be added. For larger cities, it is usually the water and sewerage service provider that will be the most appropriate operator.\n\nLocal governments may choose to provide services by using their own staff and resources for collection, transportation and treatment. This is often the case in smaller cities or municipalities where the water utility may not have a broad reach. In many cases, cooperation between the city government and the water utility may be strategically advantageous. Dumaguete City, Philippines is one example where the Water District (utility) and Local Government have joint ownership and responsibilities for the FSM program. Organized larger scale FSM programs may be able to provide the service more cheaply and more hygienically than the independent private operators working on an \"ad hoc\" basis. Ensuring services are affordable is an important selling point when promoting the program to citizens and encouraging them to participate.\n\nThe local private sector is an important player in providing FSM services. In such cases, private sector contractors may work directly for households (under regulation) or bid on desludging contracts let by the city. The private sector can also provide services in operating and maintaining the treatment works, and in processing and selling the commodities resulting from the treatment process. San Fernando City, La Union, Philippines is an example of a local government that has contracted out the treatment facility construction and collection program to the private sector.\n\nFSM is but one aspect of citywide sanitation that also includes: \nThere are important synergies between many of these services and FSM, and investigating co-management opportunities can yield benefits. MSW can often be co-managed with fecal waste, especially when thermal treatment technologies are used. Food waste from restaurants and markets can be co-composted with fecal waste to produce a high value soils amendment. Fats, Oil and Grease (FOG) from commercial grease traps can be added to biodigesters to increase methane production, or used in conjunction with fecal sludge as a feedstock for biodiesel production. Water supply is also closely linked with FSM as it is often the water utility that will manage programs and their customers that will pay for services through tariffs.\n\nIn Southeast Asia, there is increasing interest in scheduled desludging programs as a means of providing services. Under this scheme, users pay monthly tariffs that are included with their water bill to cover the cost of services. The trucks move from neighborhood to neighborhood on a scheduled cycle. Truck operators are licensed and compensated based on the volume of waste delivered to the treatment plant, which serves as an incentive against illegal dumping. The concept was first introduced in the Philippines in 2010 and has been replicated there successfully.\n\nCo-treatment of septage at wastewater treatment plants is the method of choice for cities where almost all households have access to sewerage. In those situations the volume of septage is small in comparison with that of wastewater.\n\nA formal process should be used for making an informed technology selection for the treatment of the fecal sludge. It is usually \"a\" collaborative process conducted by stakeholders, consultants, the operator and the future owner of the facility\".\" The process is based on a long term vision planning with stakeholders as part of citywide sanitation planning. The expected waste flows (volume), their strength, characteristics, and variability in each area need to be known. A formal and transparent process for developing appropriate plans and designs for wastewater and fecal sludge treatment plants will achieve local buy-in and ownership of technology decisions, which is critical for the long term success and sustainability of the program.\n\nIf the fecal sludge is liquid enough, it is usually collected by using vacuum pumps or centrifugal style booster pumps. A variety of manual and motorized devices designed to excavate thick and viscous sludge and accumulated trash are also available in the market.\n\nAfter sitting for years in septic tanks and pit latrines, the accumulated sludge becomes hardened and is very difficult to remove. It is still common that workers enter pits in order to desludge them, even though this practice is generally unsafe and undesirable (in India, this practice is called \"manual scavenging\"). A number of low-cost pumping systems exist to remove this hardened sludge hygienically from the ground surface, although many of them are still in the experimental stage (e.g. Excravator, Gulper, e-Vac).\n\nFecal sludge can also be treated inside the tank or pit as well, by use of the \"in-pit lime stabilization process\", which treats the waste before it is removed from the tank or pit. This methodology was first pioneered by iDE Cambodia in 2010. Once removed, it is transported to onsite or off site treatment and processing facilities.\n\nSome advanced transfer stations and vacuum trucks can dewater fecal sludge to some extent, and this water may be placed in sewer lines to be treated in wastewater treatment plants. This allows more sludge to be dealt with more efficiently and may constitute one of the best cases of co-treatment of fecal sludge in wastewater treatment plants.\n\nTransfer stations are intermediary drop off locations often used where treatment facilities are located too far away from population centers to make direct disposal feasible. In other locations, traffic concerns or local truck bans during daylight hours may make transfer stations feasible. In addition, municipalities where a significant percentage of homes cannot be accessed by tanker truck should utilize transfer stations. Transfer stations are used if:\n\n\nMobile transfer stations are nothing more than larger tanker trucks or trailers that are deployed along with small vacuum trucks and motorcycle or hand carts. The smaller vehicles discharge to the larger tanker, which then carries the collected sludge to the treatment plant. These work well in scheduled desludging business models.\n\nFixed transfer stations are dedicated facilities installed strategically throughout the municipality that serve as drop off locations for collected fecal sludge. They may include a receiving station with screens, a tank for holding the collected waste, trash storage containers, and wash down facilities. These may be more appropriate for FSM programs using the \"call-for-service\" business model.\n\nWhile static transfer stations are fixed tanks, mobile transfer stations are simply tanker trucks or trailers that work alongside the SVVs and actually do the longer haul transferring of the waste from the community to the treatment plant. Mobile transfer stations work best for scheduled desludging programs where there are no traffic restrictions or truck bans, and a relatively large number of homes that are inaccessible to the larger vehicles.\n\nFecal Sludge is often processed through a series of treatment steps to first separate the liquids from the solids, and then treat both the liquid and solid trains while recovering as much of the energy or nutritive value as possible. Common processes at fecal sludge treatment plants include:\n\n\nConstructed wetlands are gaining attention as a low-cost treatment technology that can be constructed in many instances using local materials and labor. For sites with enough land and a ready supply of gravel and sand, this technology offers low cost, scalability, and simple operation.\n\nSimple sludge drying beds can be used, as they are a cheap and simple method to dry fecal sludge (they are also widely used to dry sewage sludge). Drainage water must be captured; drying beds are sometimes covered but usually left uncovered. \n\nDrying beds are typically composed of four layers consisting of gravel and sand. The first layer is coarse gravel that is 15 to 20 centimeters thick. Followed by fine gravel that is 10 centimeters thick. The third layer is sand that can be between 10 to 15 centimeters and serves as the filter between the sludge and gravel. Sludge dries up and water percolates to the first layer that is collected at the drainage pipe that is beneath all layers.\n\nEmerging technologies for fecal sludge treatment include: \n\nComposting is a process whereby organic matter is digested in the presence of oxygen with the byproduct of heat. For fecal sludge, the heat deactivates the pathogens while the digestion process breaks down the organic matter into a humus-like material that acts as a soils amendment, and nutrients that are broken down into a form that is more easily taken up by plants. Properly treated fecal sludge can be reused in agriculture (see also reuse of excreta).\n\nFecal sludge is rich in nitrogen. When they are mixed with materials that are rich in carbon, such as shredded crop wastes, the composting process can be maximized. Proper mixture to achieve a ratio of 20 to 1 to 30 to 1 of carbon to nitrogen is best.\n\nBiogas is a byproduct of the anaerobic digestion process.\n\nTreated effluent can be used for agricultural or landscape irrigation.\n\nThese by-products have the potential to offset some of the costs of the program, thereby reducing tariffs for the public. However, value addition all the way to biogas, biodiesel and electricity is difficult to achieve in practice due to technological and operational challenges.\n\nFSM is considered an entry point for sanitation improvement programs that are led by local governments. Such programs may include tariffs or user fees, promotions campaigns to raise the willingness to pay for the service, and local ordinances that define the rules and regulations governing FSM. In the Philippines, tariffs around $1 USD per family per month are generally enough to achieve full cost recovery within a period of 3 to 7 years. Promotional campaigns are used to raise the willingness to pay for services, and local procedures and ordinances provide additional incentives for compliance.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "4448258", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=4448258", "title": "Food photography", "text": "Food photography\n\nFood photography is a still life photography genre used to create attractive still life photographs of food. It is a specialization of commercial photography, the products of which are used in advertisements, magazines, packaging, menus or cookbooks. Professional food photography is a collaborative effort, usually involving an art director, a photographer, a food stylist, a prop stylist and their assistants.\n\nIn advertising, food photography is often – and sometimes controversially – used to exaggerate the attractiveness or size of the advertised food, notably fast food.\n\nFor a long time, food photographs tended to be shot and composed in a manner similar to the way people were used to encountering their food: laid out on a table setting and shot from an overhead perspective, i.e., from the point of view of the eater. Stylists accordingly arranged the food to appear good from above, with the items arranged flat on the plate and clearly separated from each other.<ref name=\"Manna 4/4\">Manna/Boss, Chapter 4, section \"Food-Styling Trends\".</ref>\n\nLater, romantic lighting, shallower angles and more props came \"en vogue\", with extreme cases leading to the term \"food porn\". Most recently, the prevailing trend in Western commercial food photography is to present the food as simple, clean and naturally as possible and with little props, often using effects such as selective focus, tilted plates, and extreme close-ups. This complements trends in professional cooking to make the food more visually interesting. For instance, the height of dishes tends to increase and their elements are often layered, which lends itself well to narrow-angled shots.\n\nThe role of the food stylist is to make the food look attractive in the finished photograph. The time and effort a stylist takes to carefully and artfully arrange the food, is the cause of differences between the way the stylist presents it and the way a home cook or chef may. Visual know-how is also a requirement, as is the knowledge of how to translate the perception of taste, aroma and appeal that one gets from an actual dish, to a two-dimensional photograph.\n\nFood stylists have culinary training; some are professional chefs or have a background in home economics.<ref name=\"Manna 4/1\">Manna/Boss, Chapter 4, section \"What Is a Food Stylist?\".</ref> In addition to knowledge of nutrition and cooking techniques, food stylists must also be resourceful shoppers. As creative professionals they envision the finished photograph and style the food accordingly.\n\nThe process of food photography begins with the purchase of the food and ingredients. Only the most visually perfect foodstuffs are acceptable and multiple backup or test items are usually needed. As a result, purchase of the food and ingredients is a very time-consuming process. The best-looking of the purchased items is selected and marked as the \"hero\", i.e., the item that will be featured in the photograph. During the setup and for test shoots, it is represented by a cardboard stand-in.\n\nThe actual photography can take place in a studio under controlled lighting conditions, or under natural light. The light, background and setting is carefully prepared so as to present the food in as attractive a way as possible without distracting from it. The color and texture of the background is selected so as to effectively complement that of the food and to assist with its lighting.\n\nStyled food is usually marked as inedible and discarded after the shoot, because it may have been handled or treated in ways that make it unsafe for consumption.\n\nTo create the effect of a thin layer of condensation forming on the outside of glasses containing cold liquid, dulling spray may be applied, with paper or masking tape protecting the non-\"frosted\" areas. More pronounced condensation and dew drops are imitated by spraying the glass with corn syrup or glycerin.\n\nIce cubes used in shoots are made of acrylic, so they do not move or melt during the shoot, which may take place under hot studio lighting. Fresh-looking bubbles on the surface of drinks are created by applying a mixture of the drink and detergent to the surface with an eyedropper. White glue may be used in lieu of milk, and a mixture of brewed coffee and water instead of tea.\n\nSalads in food photography are composed with a view to creating appealing textures, shapes and colors. To improve support and aid in composition, salad in a bowl is built around a smaller bowl placed inverted in the larger bowl. Salad greens are kept fresh and crisp by misting them with cold water prior to composition. Salad dressing is not normally used, as it makes the salad slippery and difficult to style, but the appearance of dressing may be created by sprinkling herbs and spices over the wet salad, or mixing them in oil and applying it with a brush.\n\nFruit salads are particularly challenging to shoot because of the short time the fruit pieces, which are cut immediately prior to final photography, retain their appearance. As only the outer layer of the salad is of interest, the concealed interior of the salad bowl may be filled by mashed potatoes or another mixture. Thick or heavy dressings do not photograph well; they are usually thinned and applied by brush.\n\nHamburger photography is challenging because the buns dent easily and an assembled burger is quick to lose its visual appeal. When assembling the burger, the ingredients are held in place with toothpicks and the meaty interior of tomato slices is removed to avoid juice discoloring the ingredients. The meat patties are superficially cooked, the edges browned with a torch and the meat made to look more appetizing with a colorant. The edges of melted cheese slices may be brushed with household cleaner to make them look freshly melted longer. Condiments such as mayonnaise are applied to the edges with an applicator bottle. Steam is normally used to suggest the burger is hot.\n\nSandwiches are assembled using similar techniques. Wet paper towels are used to prevent the bread from drying out. If a half sandwich is to be depicted, the bread and the components are individually sliced with scissors and assembled in place.\n\n\n"}

The Asian city state of Singapore is a multi-ethnic and multi-religious society of over 4 million people. Singapore is an island country made up of 63 islands, it is separated from Malaysia by the Straits of Johor to its north and from Indonesia's Riau Islands by the Singapore Strait to its south. Singapore is highly urbanised but almost half of the country is covered by greenery. This article outlines the roots, chronological contexts and growth of clinical psychology through the periods from the 1950s to the new millennium. \n\nUnlike many countries where the growth of psychology stemmed from academia, psychology in Singapore probably owes its genesis to the lunatic asylum. After the British had re-established colonial rule in Singapore at the close of World War II, the first known person to be appointed as a psychologist was V W Wilson, DSC, MA, Dip Ed. Dr J Browne was Medical Superintendent (1950–1958) and he introduced many changes and improvements to Woodbridge Hospital, including the need for a psychological service. Wilson, an Australian, was appointed to the colonial Medical Service on 11 September 1956 on contract from the United Kingdom to build up and incorporate a full psychological service within the mental health programme based at the Woodbridge Mental Hospital. The appointment of Wilson was in line with the policy of the time when key appointments were normally filled by British officers.\n\nJust before Wilson's appointment, M K Wong, a graduate of Western Reserve University (USA), commenced limited psychological functions as a \"pupil psychologist\" for a short period before leaving for further clinical training at the Institute of Psychiatry, London.\n\nUpon his engagement, Wilson established the basic framework for the development of a psychological service in four main areas:\n\nFrom the outset, Wilson's framework for the establishment of a psychological service, although within the mental health programme, was quite far-reaching, covering medical, social welfare and educational fields as well as providing advisory services to government bodies. These became the platforms upon which psychological services were expanded and delivered to many government bodies and other organizations till the present time.\n\nWilson's contract expired in December 1959, so Wong who returned home at that time, took over Wilson's functions under the Malayanization process during which national workers replaced colonial expatriates at about the time when Singapore gained internal self-government. For about a decade, Wong (1959–1969) worked within the framework that Wilson had set by providing psychological services within Woodbridge Hospital as well as to the Department of Paediatrics in the Singapore General Hospital, School Health Services and various voluntary and welfare organizations such as the Singapore Association for Retarded Children, School for the Deaf, Singapore Association for the Blind, Singapore Children's Society. Wong also conducted lectures to nurses and other student groups.\n\nIn March 1968, F Y Long was employed as the second psychologist. Long, who completed his clinical psychology training at Sydney University, added impetus to what Wong had earlier embarked upon. Personality testing, including the use of projective techniques, became part and parcel of psychological assessment. Hitherto the psychologists conducted mainly IQ testing. Soon after, behaviour therapy was applied for the first time in Woodbridge Hospital on a case of stammering but psychologists were not accorded any therapeutic functions. In May, psychological assessment was extended to the selection of renal patients for haemodialysis at the Renal Unit in the Singapore General Hospital. In July 1968, Dr Ho Eng Siong (designated child psychiatrist) and Long commenced weekly child guidance clinic for cases from Gimson Boys' School and welfare homes. Following Wong's resignation in October 1969, Long continued to implement what his predecessors had established but focused more on clinical work at Woodbridge Hospital and services to SGH, TTSH and Prisons Department.\n\nDuring the early 1970s, with the Child Guidance Clinic in full-time operation, demands for psychological help were heavy. At the direction of the then Minister for Health, the late Mr Chua Sian Chin, a five-year projection for psychological services within the Ministry of Health was submitted in April 1970. Subsequently, several psychologists (David Oon, Lee Mee Mee, MC Foo and Lily Ng) were added to the staff at Woodbridge Hospital and Child Guidance Clinic.\n\nBehaviour therapy became the psychologists' recognized role after 1971 when Professor S Rachman, a renowned pioneer in the field, convinced the psychiatrists at Woodrbdige Hospital of what the psychologists could contribute to the clinical management of psychiatric patients. A programme of token economy was successfully carried out in a chronic ward in 1973. The psychologists with the other members of the psychiatric team were involved in rehabilitation projects in Woodbridge Hospital. Psychology lectures for various groups of nurses at the School of Nursing in SGH, the WH School of Psychiatric Nursing as well as to students at the Department of Social Work & Social Administration, University of Singapore were in high demand.\n\nSince the beginning of 1970, psychological services were extended to the Ministry of Social Affairs and the Prisons Department. John Elliott was appointed the first psychologist in the Ministry of Social Affairs (later known as the Ministry of Community Development). A few years later, Loh Yan Poh became the first psychologist serving full-time in the Prisons Department.\n\nIn the 1980s, in addition to the psychiatric services at Woodbridge Hospital, requests for psychological assistance and inputs from various Government agencies were relentless. The Ministry of Home Affairs commissioned psychological studies on secret society members and other youth groups. The Public Service Commission called on Woodbridge Hospital to provide psychological assessment on President's and Overseas Merit Scholarship candidates. The Singapore Police Force inducted two psychologists into their Hostage Negotiation teams as well as for other operational needs. The Prime Minister's Office also required psychological evaluation on political and other candidates earmarked for higher office. In view of these demands, a number of psychologists (KC Ong, KW Boey, Alice Yeoh, KW Ong, TG Oh, CL Lim, June Wong, Viven Chua and Chew Yang Hee) were appointed at varying periods. In 1984, the Department of Psychology was officially established as a centralised Psychological Service for the entire Civil Service (except for the Ministry of Education which had its own scheme of service for educational psychologists) with the Ministry of Health as the Central Appointing Authority. FY Long was appointed Head of Department and de facto Chief Psychologist.\nBy the late 1980s a new lineup of psychologists (Lyn Chua, Elizabeth Pang, Lee Ming Shu, Teresa Foong, Vivienne Ng, Shirley Tan, Christopher Choo and Marina Yap) came into service and replaced those who had left. They were organized according to the Hospital's psychiatric units and clinics. With the rapid expansion of services, the Department of Psychology at Woodbridge Hospital in effect had spawned psychological service units at various government ministries and agencies; with psychology service units established at the Ministry of Community Development (now Ministry of Community Development Youths and Sports), Prisons Department, Singapore Police Force, Public Service Commission, School Health Services, Tan Tock Seng Hospital and Singapore General Hospital.\n\nThe 1990s could be said to be the golden decade for psychological service. In 1993 when Woodbridge Hospital moved its location to Buangkok Green as the Institute of Mental Health & Woodbridge Hospital, the first appointed CEO, Dr Luisa Lee, lent strong support to the Psychology Department in conducting mental health education, smoking cessation and stress management workshops for the community. Neuropsychological testing, cognitive behavioural therapy, individual and group psychotherapy were widely used. Requirements for psychology lectures, talks and courses continued unabated. Several new psychologists were recruited: Clare Yeo, Carolyn Kee, Yap Ang Keong, Janice Chua, Khoo Sue Ann, Matthew Woo, Joyce Leong, Lim Kok Kwang, Patricia Tan and Ong Li Min. The psychologists were deployed according to the revamped psychiatric departments, units, outpatient services, research and rehabilitation programmes.\n\nIn the aftermath of the Hotel New World disaster, the Ministry of Home Affairs enhanced the country's emergency planning to include the need for psychological support for victims of such incidents. In July 1994, in conjunction with the Ministry of Health and other Government agencies, Home Affairs set up the National Emergency Behaviour Management System with FY Long as the Chief EBO and TG Oh as Deputy to provide leadership in the development of the system. The NEBMS was activated during the 1996 North-South Highway accident, the 1997 SilkAir MI 185 and 2000 SQ 006 air disasters. Woodbridge Hospital played a key role in providing professional support in all three incidents as well as subsequent disasters like the Asian tsunami.\n\nWith the restructuring of the Ministry of Health and corporatisation of the health services and public hospitals, including Woodbridge Hospital, the Psychological Service as a Government centralised scheme of service was disbanded in 2000. It marks the close of an era of clinical psychological services in Singapore and opens a new chapter of opportunities and challenges for the next generation of psychologists in providing psychological help to those who need it. Several new officers: Andrea Lai, Lena Leong, Winifred, et al. joined the Department and together with their senior colleagues have received the torch to run the next lap in the history of psychological services at Woodridge Hospital. With the introduction of the National Mental Health Blueprint, community psychology became increasingly popular. The IMH community psychology teams for the Elderly (APCATS), Adults (CMHT) and for Children and Adolescents (REACH) provided education and mental healthcare in collaboration with community partners in the schools and homes of patients. REACH, in particular, did exceptionally well and won several awards. This included the National Medical Excellence Award. The rise of community mental health teams coincided with another sunrise for psychology in Singapore. Psychologists Gifford Chan, Jeffrey Ong, Rashidah Sulaiman, amongst others, were recruited and trained. from REACH, the mental health network for children in Singapore extended to Family Service Centres, Voluntary Welfare Organisations, Singapore Polyclinics and in all schools.\n\nMental health in Singapore during the colonial period\n"}

He is an authority on obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) and anxiety disorders whose work is highly cited. He maintains a research lab and serves as the Director of the UNC-CH Anxiety and Stress Disorders Clinic. Abramowitz approaches the understanding and treatment of psychological problems from a cognitive-behavioral perspective.\n\nAbramowitz earned his B.A. in Psychology from Muhlenberg College in 1991, his M.A. in Psychology from Bucknell University in 1993, and his Ph.D. in Clinical Psychology from the University of Memphis in 1998. He completed both a predoctoral internship and postdoctoral fellowship at the Center for Treatment and Study of Anxiety at the University of Pennsylvania. He was a staff psychologist and Associate Professor at the Mayo Clinic (Rochester, MN) from 2000 until 2006. He moved to North Carolina in the summer of 2006.\n\nAbramowitz's research focuses on the development and evaluation of cognitive-behavioral treatments (CBT) for OCD and other anxiety-related problems, as well as on understanding the nature and psychopathology of these problems. He is the author of approximately 300 publications, including more than 10 books and over 250 peer reviewed journal articles and book chapters. He has also worked extensively as a book and journal editor. Abramowitz has given invited lectures around the world and served in numerous editorial and advisory roles for scientific journals and organizations.\n\nAbramowitz is board certified by the American Board of Behavioral Psychology and is a licensed psychologist in North Carolina. In his clinical practice, he specializes in providing outpatient consultation and cognitive-behavioral treatment of OCD and other anxiety-related problems.\n\nTreatment of OCD and anxiety: A major focus of Abramowitz's research is the treatment of OCD. His work primarily addresses exposure and response prevention (ERP; a form of cognitive-behavioral therapy [CBT]) and he has conducted treatment outcome studies and meta-analytic reviews of this therapy. He has also investigated factors that predict good and poor outcomes.\n\nAbramowitz has helped to develop an OCD treatment program combining ERP with Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT). He has also helped to develop couple-based ERP programs for OCD and Body Dysmorphic Disorder.\n\nAbramowitz has written about, and is conducting research to better understand, how to enhance the outcome of exposure therapy/ERP by optimizing extinction learning. This work is drawn from inhibitory learning models of exposure.\n\nNature and symptoms of OCD: Abramowitz's research also focuses on trying to understand the complex symptomatology of OCD. His work has identified 4 subtypes/dimensions of this disorder that involve somewhat distinct cognitive and behavioral phenomena: (a) contamination, (b) responsibility for harm/mistakes, (c) unacceptable thoughts, and (d) incompleteness/symmetry. He has also contributed to the re-conceptualization of hoarding as separate from OCD.\n\nAbramowitz has argued that OCD symptoms lie on a continuum with normal everyday experiences, and that one’s learning history (and to a lesser extent, their biology) influence the frequency, intensity, and duration of OCD symptoms. He has also criticized the DSM-5’s re-classification of OCD as separate from the anxiety disorders and as overlapping with conditions such as Hair Pulling Disorder and Skin Picking Disorder. Abramowitz is generally critical of biomedical models which view problems such as OCD and anxiety as brain diseases or genetic disorders.\n\nAssessment of OCD: Abramowitz led a team of researchers in 2010 that developed the Dimensional Obsessive-Compulsive Scale (DOCS), a 20-item self-report instrument designed to measure the severity of the four types of OCD symptoms (see above). The DOCS has been translated into multiple languages for use worldwide.\n\nCognitive-behavioral factors and models of OCD and anxiety: The cognitive-behavioral model is the leading conceptual approach to understanding OCD and anxiety disorders. Abramowitz conducts cross-sectional, experimental, and prospective (longitudinal) research that has helped to clarify and advance this conceptual model. His work focuses on cognitive biases such as anxiety sensitivity, thought-action fusion, intolerance of uncertainty, and attentional biases that factor in the persistence of OCD and irrational fear. With his team at UNC, he has developed experimental paradigms for studying thought-action fusion and intolerance of uncertainty. His work has also demonstrated that cognitive factors prospectively predict the escalation of intrusive thoughts into obsessions.\n\nAbramowitz also conducts studies on cognitive-behavioral factors in other anxiety and related problems, including health/illness anxiety, shy bladder syndrome, panic disorder, and hoarding.\n\nScrupulosity: Abramowitz has conducted studies on, and developed a cognitive-behavioral model of, scrupulosity (religious obsessions and compulsions). He also developed the Penn Inventory of Scrupulosity (PIOS) to measure this phenomenon.\n\nPrevention of postpartum OCD: Abramowitz developed and evaluated a prevention program for OCD symptoms in new parents. This work was derived from previous studies led by Abramowitz showing that certain types of cognitive/psychological phenomena (such as the tendency to catastrophically misinterpret unwanted thoughts) predict the development of OCD symptoms in the postpartum. The prevention program, known as \"Baby PREP\", can be delivered as part of perinatal education classes and was shown to be more effective than a credible placebo control program in preventing OCD symptoms among vulnerable expecting/new parents.\n\nCross-cultural factors: Abramowitz has conducted research on cultural, religious, and racial differences in the expression of anxiety and OCD symptoms and related phenomena. He is part of a multi-national collaborative effort studying the nature of intrusive obsessional thoughts in cultures and countries around the world.\n\nAbramowitz's contributions to the fields of OCD, anxiety disorders, and clinical psychology are recognized by his colleagues, peers, and the media through numerous honors, awards, and appearances. He is a Fellow and Past President of the Association for Behavioral and Cognitive Therapies (ABCT) and serves on the International OCD Foundation Scientific and Clinical Advisory Board. He is the recipient of a Muhlenberg College Alumni Achievement Award, the David Shakow Early Career Award for Outstanding Contributions to the Science and Practice of Clinical Psychology (from Division 12 of the American Psychological Association), and the Mayo Clinic Department of Psychiatry and Psychology Outstanding Contributions to Research Award.\n\nAbramowitz has served on the Editorial Boards of several scientific journals and as Associate Editor of \"Journal of Cognitive Psychotherapy\" (2008–present) and Associate Editor of \"Behaviour Research and Therapy\" (2006-2015). He is the Editor-in-Chief of the \"Journal of Obsessive-Compulsive and Related Disorders\". Expertscape ranks him among the top 20 experts on OCD and his ResearchGate score is higher than 97.5% of this site's members.\n\nAbramowitz was invited by colleagues in Norway to help train and supervise 30 OCD treatment teams in that country. The training is part of an initiative funded by the Norwegian government to ensure that all individuals with OCD in Norway have access to effective treatment.\n\nAbramowitz has twice been appointed as Associate Chair of the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill Department of Psychology and Neuroscience, a position he held from 2007-2017.\n\nAbramowitz lives in Chapel Hill, North Carolina with his wife and two daughters.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "382395", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=382395", "title": "Lifestyle disease", "text": "Lifestyle disease\n\nLifestyle diseases are defined as diseases linked with the way people live their life. This is commonly caused by alcohol, drug and smoking abuse as well as lack of physical activity and unhealthy eating. Diseases that impact on our lifestyle are heart disease, stroke, obesity and type II diabetes. The diseases that appear to increase in frequency as countries become more industrialized and people live longer can include Alzheimer's disease, arthritis, atherosclerosis, asthma, cancer, chronic liver disease or cirrhosis, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, type 2 diabetes, heart disease, metabolic syndrome, chronic renal failure, osteoporosis, stroke, depression, obesity and vascular dementia. In the UK the death rate is four times higher from respiratory disease caused by an unhealthy lifestyle.\n\nSome commenters maintain a distinction between diseases of longevity and diseases of civilization or diseases of affluence. Certain diseases, such as diabetes, dental caries and asthma, appear at greater rates in young populations living in the \"western\" way; their increased incidence is not related to age, so the terms cannot accurately be used interchangeably for all diseases.\n\nDiet and lifestyle are major factors thought to influence susceptibility to many diseases. Drug abuse, tobacco smoking, and alcohol drinking, as well as a lack of or too much exercise may also increase the risk of developing certain diseases, especially later in life. Between 1995 and 2005 813,000 Australians were hospitalised due to alcohol.\n\nIn many Western countries, people began to consume more meat, dairy products, vegetable oils, tobacco, sugary foods, Coca-Cola, and alcoholic beverages during the latter half of the 20th century. People also developed sedentary lifestyles and greater rates of obesity. In 2014 11.2 million Australians were overweight or obese Rates of colorectal cancer, breast cancer, prostate cancer, endometrial cancer and lung cancer started increasing after this dietary change. People in developing countries, whose diets still depend largely on low-sugar starchy foods with little meat or fat have lower rates of these cancers. Causes are not just from smoking and alcohol abuse. Adults can develop lifestyle diseases through behavioural factors that impact on them. These can be unemployment, unsafe life, poor social environment, working conditions, stress and home life can change a person’s lifestyle to increase their risk of developing one of these diseases.\n\nIn 2013 there were 147,678 deaths within Australia mostly from lifestyle diseases including smoking of tobacco, alcohol use and other drugs, violence and unhealthy weight have impacted on Australians' death rate. The leading cause of death of Australian males was heart disease with 11,016 deaths, followed by lung cancer with 4,995 deaths, and chronic pulmonary disease killing 3,572. All these conditions were mainly attributed to smoking, alcohol abuse or unhealthy lifestyle. In 2013 coronary heart disease was the leading cause of death in 8,750 women, mainly as a result of their lifestyle. Dementia and Alzheimer disease came second, affecting 7,277 females and thirdly, cerebrovascular disease, killing 6,368. These top three causes of deaths could be minimized through lifestyle changes within the Australian population.\n\nTable Shows that ages of people dying and the top five diseases of which they are dying.\n\nIn 1900, the top three causes of death in the United States were pneumonia/influenza, tuberculosis, and diarrhea/enteritis. Communicable diseases accounted for about 60 percent of all deaths. In 1900, heart disease and cancer were ranked number four and eight respectively. Since the 1940s, the majority of deaths in the United States have resulted from heart disease, cancer, and other degenerative diseases. And, by the late 1990s, degenerative diseases accounted for more than 60 percent of all deaths.\n\nLifestyle diseases have their onset later in an individual's life; they appear to increase in frequency as countries become more industrialized and people live longer. This suggests that the life expectancy at birth of 49.24 years in 1900 \nwas too short for degenerative diseases to occur, compared to a life expectancy at birth of 77.8 years in 2004. Also, survivorship to the age of 50 was 58.5% in 1900, and 93.7% in 2007.\n\nPrevention is remedies or activities that aim to reduce the likelihood of a disease or disorder affecting people. Lifestyle diseases are preventable for children if parents set them on the correct path, as early life decisions and influences can impact people later on in life. Lifestyle diseases can be prevented through reduction in smoking of tobacco the Australian Government has started this by introducing plain packaging for all tobacco products and increasing the prices of tobacco production. Overweightness and obesity can be prevented through a well balanced lifestyle through healthy eating and exercise. Prevention can come about by a person undertaking 30 minutes of moderate exercise daily or by doing 150 minutes of moderate intensity exercise a week. Examples of moderate exercise includes a brisk walk, swim, bike ride or it can also be everyday life activities like mowing the lawn or house cleaning. In addition, animals studies have suggested that early life exercise can reduce the risk of developing metabolic diseases in adulthood. All causes of lifestyle disease can be prevented through giving up smoking and other drugs, reducing ones intake of alcohol, processed meats (like bacon and sausages), red meats (like pork, beef and lamb), fatty foods and by engaging in daily exercise.\n\n"}

Depending on the water level, its area ranges from 216 to 418 km². The corresponding water levels above mean sea level are 240–245 meters. The filling of the reservoir Lokka began in 1967, and with this reservoir, the amount of water coming to the power plants in Kemijoki could be regulated. Lokka has also been famous for its rich fish population. There are also populations of white-tailed eagles at the reservoir. These do not migrate south for the winter, instead they stay at Lokka to feed on fish left by local fishermen.\n\nLokka is connected to the Porttipahta Reservoir through the Vuotso Canal.\n"}

The ideal position is with the professional sitting in front of the patient. The examination may take place with the patient sitting or in supine position, but to investigate possible varicocele and hernia it is necessary that the patient is standing in front of the examiner. In a genital examination, the doctor can detect abnormalities such as phimosis, lumps, tumors, redness, excoriation, edema, lesions, swelling, cancer and many others.\n\n\nOutside of the medical scope, there may also be social reasons for conducting genital examinations. For instance child refugees from Syria have had their genitals examined in some European countries in order to determine their age. There have also been proposals by some lawmakers to initiate genital inspections in bathrooms at schools in response to a debate over which bathrooms should be used by transgender or intersex students.\n\n"}
{"id": "859943", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=859943", "title": "March of Dimes", "text": "March of Dimes\n\nMarch of Dimes is a United States nonprofit organization that works to improve the health of mothers and babies to prevent birth defects, premature birth and infant mortality.\n\nThe organization was founded by President Franklin D. Roosevelt in 1938, as the National Foundation for Infantile Paralysis, to combat polio. The name \"March of Dimes\" was coined by Eddie Cantor. After funding Jonas Salk's polio vaccine, the organization expanded its focus to the prevention of birth defects and infant mortality. In 2005, as preterm birth emerged as the leading cause of death for children worldwide, research and prevention of premature birth became the organization's primary focus.\n\nMarch of Dimes improves the health of mothers and babies through five programming areas: medical research, education of pregnant women, community programs, government advocacy, and support of pregnant women and mothers. The organization provides women and families with educational resources on baby health, pregnancy, preconception and new motherhood, as well as supplying information and support to families in the NICU who are affected by prematurity, birth defects, or other infant health problems.\n\nThe organization began in 1938 as the National Foundation for Infantile Paralysis. In 1976 it became known as the March of Dimes Birth Defects Foundation. In 2007, the formal name became the March of Dimes Foundation.\n\nThe group was founded by President Franklin D. Roosevelt on January 3, 1938, as a response to U.S. epidemics of polio, a condition that can leave people with permanent physical disabilities. Roosevelt was himself diagnosed with polio in 1921, although his symptoms are now known to be more consistent with Guillain–Barré syndrome – an autoimmune neuropathy which Roosevelt's doctors failed to consider as a diagnostic possibility. The foundation was an alliance between scientists and volunteers, with volunteers raising money to support research and education efforts.\n\nThe National Foundation for Infantile Paralysis was a reconstitution of the Georgia Warm Springs Foundation, which Roosevelt and his friend Basil O'Connor founded with other friends in 1927. O'Connor became the foundation's president, a position he held for more than three decades. His first task was to create a network of local chapters that could raise money and deliver aid; more than 3,100 county chapters were established during his tenure.\n\nThe name \"March of Dimes\" — a play on the contemporary radio and newsreel series, \"The March of Time\" — was coined by stage, screen and radio star Eddie Cantor. He inspired a nationwide fundraising campaign in the week preceding President Roosevelt's birthday on January 30, 1938. Lapel pins were sold for ten cents each; special features were produced by the motion picture studios and radio industry; and nightclubs and cabarets held dances and contributed a portion of the proceeds. Thousands of people mailed cards and letters, each containing a dime, to the White House. Cantor's appeal collected more than $85,000 in what the press called \"a silver tide which actually swamped the White House.\"\n\n\"During the past few days bags of mail have been coming, literally by the truck load, to the White House,\" Roosevelt said in birthday celebration broadcast January 30, 1938. \"Yesterday between forty and fifty thousand letters came to the mail room of the White House. Today an even greater number — how many I cannot tell you — for we can only estimate the actual count by counting the mail bags. In all the envelopes are dimes and quarters and even dollar bills — gifts from grown-ups and children — mostly from children who want to help other children get well. … It is glorious to have one's birthday associated with a work like this.\"\n\nThe March of Dimes was the title used for the foundation's annual fundraising event that requested each child donate a dime. At the Christmas season, booths were set up in cities where the children could drop their dime in a slot. These were out on the street and sometimes not even overseen by anyone. Gradually the name became synonymous with that of the organization.\n\n\"His genius was in generating large numbers of relatively small contributions for a cause,\" \"The New York Times\" wrote of O'Connor. \"Over the years he collected and spent more than seven billion dimes — many of them from schoolchildren — with a half-billion dollars of it going to the war on polio.\"\n\nPublisher Gerard Piel credited O'Connor with a \"unique social invention: a permanently self-sustaining source of funds for the support of research — the voluntary health organization.\" With a centralized administration, state and local chapters and a large corps of volunteers, the National Foundation for Infantile Paralysis became the prototype for dozens of similar foundations.\n\nBecause Franklin D. Roosevelt founded the March of Dimes, a redesign of the dime was chosen to honor him after his death. The Roosevelt dime was issued in 1946, on what would have been the president's 64th birthday.\n\nFrom 1938 through the approval of the Salk vaccine in 1955, the foundation spent $233 million on polio patient care, which led to more than 80 percent of U.S. polio patients' receiving significant foundation aid.\n\nAround the same time, Albert Sabin (also with funding from the March of Dimes) developed a simpler version of the vaccine, which was based on an attenuated live version of the polio virus. Both Salk's version and Sabin's version had potential safety concerns; Salk's vaccine had the risk of a virus which is not completely inactivated, while Sabin's vaccine had the risk of reversion to virulence.\n\nIn 1955, a batch of Salk's vaccine made by Cutter Laboratories in California was inadequately inactivated and, as a result, 11 children died. After this incident, production methods were changed and no further incidents were reported. Sabin became highly critical of O'Connor and the March of Dimes, who he believed were biased towards Salk's vaccine and made statements inconsistent with the scientific research. In the meantime, trials of the vaccine based on Sabin's version were carried out in the Soviet Union with important contributions made by Mikhail Chumakov. In 1958, the Soviet Union organized industrial production of this vaccine and polio was largely eradicated in Eastern Europe and Japan. This success led to trials in the United States as well and the licensing of the Sabin's vaccine in 1961, over the considerable opposition of the March of Dimes, which supported Salk's vaccine. Eventually, Sabin's vaccine superseded Salk's vaccine based on its advantages, which included a simpler (oral) administration and lifelong immunity.\n\nFollowing widespread use of the polio vaccine, the organization was faced with disbanding or steering its resources toward a new mission. Basil O'Connor, then the organization's president, directed his staff to identify strengths and weaknesses and reformulate its mission. The National Foundation for Infantile Paralysis (NFIP) shortened its name to the National Foundation (NF) in 1958 and launched its \"Expanded Program\" against birth defects, arthritis, and virus diseases, seeking to become a \"flexible force\" in the field of public health. In the mid-1960s, the organization focused its efforts on prevention of birth defects and infant mortality, which became its mission. At that time, the cause of birth defects was unknown; only the effects were visible. In 1976, the organization changed its name to the March of Dimes Birth Defects Foundation. Reducing the toll of premature birth was added as a mission objective in 2005.\n\nRubella, also called German measles, is associated with a disorder called congenital rubella syndrome, which can cause miscarriages and birth defects such as deafness, blindness and mental retardation. Vaccination is an effective preventive measure. On behalf of the March of Dimes, Virginia Apgar testified to the United States Senate in 1969 about the importance of federal funding of a rubella immunization program, and the organization funded a vaccine, which was licensed in the early 1970s. In 2006, a statement published in \"Birth Defects Research Part A\" credited the \"remarkable success of the immunization program to eliminate rubella is due to joint efforts by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, various state and local health departments, the American Academy of Pediatrics, the American College of Obstetrics and Gynecology, and the March of Dimes\".\n\nIn 1976, the March of Dimes published a report titled \"Toward Improving the Outcome of Pregnancy\" (TIOP), and in 1993 they published \"Toward Improving the Outcome of Pregnancy: The 90s and Beyond\" (TIOP II). TIOP \"stratified maternal and neonatal care into 3 levels of complexity and recommended referral of high-risk patients to centers with the personnel and resources needed for their degree of risk and severity of illness.\" TIOP was published when \"resources for the most complex care were relatively scarce and concentrated in academic medical centers.\" TIOP II updated care complexity designations from levels I, II and III to basic, specialty and subspecialty, and the criteria were expanded. In 2001, the March of Dimes introduced a family support program for those with babies in a neonatal intensive care unit (NICU). The program seeks to educate NICU staff to communicate effectively with patients' families. The March of Dimes hosted the Symposium on Quality Improvement to Prevent Prematurity in October 2009. In December 2010, the March of Dimes released TIOP III, subtitled \"Enhancing Perinatal Health Through Quality, Safety, and Performance Initiatives\".\n\nFetal alcohol syndrome (FAS) is categorized as a group of birth defects ranging from mental retardation to various growth and behavioral problems. The March of Dimes has provided grant funding for FAS research, and they supported the National Council on Alcoholism in its push for legislation to bring public attention to the dangers of alcohol use by pregnant women. This led to a 1989 law mandating a warning label about the risk of birth defects that alcoholic beverages still carry today.\n\nThe March of Dimes has campaigned for public education on folic acid, a vitamin which can prevent neural tube defects such as spina bifida and anencephaly if mothers have enough of it in their body. The March of Dimes has funded polls on folic acid from The Gallup Organization. Analysis of some of the results, said that women aged 18–24 years had the least awareness regarding folic acid consumption or knowledge about when it should be taken. On the issue, the organization partnered with the Grain Foods Foundation, an industry group, in public education efforts.\n\nAwareness about preterm birth, which is associated with a variety of negative health outcomes, is an organizational goal. According to an editorial in the May 2004 issue of the \"Journal of the National Medical Association\", the original goals of the campaign were to raise awareness of the problem from 35 percent to at least 60 percent and to decrease the rate of premature births by at least 15 percent (from 11.9 percent to 10.1 percent). In 2008, the Prematurity Campaign was extended by the Board of Trustees until 2020, and global targets were set for prematurity prevention. In 2008, the March of Dimes started its annual Premature Birth Report Card, which grades the nation and each individual state on preterm birth rates.\n\nMarch of Dimes states on its website that it supports mandated newborn screening of all babies in all states in the U.S. for at least 30 life-threatening conditions for which effective treatment and reliable testing are available to prevent catastrophic consequences to the child. \nIn 2003, the March of Dimes began releasing an annual, state-by-state report card on each state's adoption of expanded newborn screening recommended by the American College of Medical Genetics. March of Dimes president Jennifer L. Howse, Ph.D. has stated that this program is intended to inform parents of the tests available in their state, enabling those with affected babies to pursue early treatment.\n\nAccording to a presentation at the 2005 annual meeting of the American Public Health Association, individual, state-based March of Dimes chapters work with governors, state legislators, health departments, health professionals, and parents to improve state newborn screening programs and to make comprehensive newborn screening programs available to every newborn throughout the country.\n\nIn 2005, only 38 percent of infants were born in states that required screening for 21 or more of 29 core conditions recommended by the American College of Medical Genetics; but by 2009, all 50 states and the District of Columbia required screening for 21 or more of these treatable disorders.\n\nThe March of Dimes published its Global Report on Birth Defects in 2006, which estimated birth defects' global burden.\n\nIn 2009, the March of Dimes partnered with the Department of Reproductive Health and Research of the World Health Organization (RHR/WHO) to publish a white paper on the global and regional toll of preterm birth worldwide. This report, which was the first attempt to identify the global scope of premature births and related infant deaths, found that an estimated 13 million infants worldwide are born premature each year and more than one million of them die in their first month of life. Further, premature births account for 9.6 percent of total births and for 28 percent of newborn deaths. The highest rates of premature birth are in Africa, followed by North America (Canada and the United States combined).\n\nEstablished in 1970, the March for Babies, previously called WalkAmerica, is the largest fundraiser of the year for the March of Dimes, as well as the oldest nationwide charitable walking event. In the decades since, many other organizations have used the walkathon format to help raise money. Funds raised by the event support March of Dimes-sponsored research and other programs to prevent premature birth, birth defects and infant mortality.\n\nAccording to the March of Dimes, March for Babies is held in more than 900 communities across the nation. Every year, 1 million people—including 20,000 company teams, family teams and national sponsors—participate in the event, which has raised more than $1.8 billion since 1970. The March of Dimes states that seventy-six cents of every dollar raised in March for Babies is spent on research and programs to help prevent premature birth, birth defects and infant mortality.\n\nThe first person to walk for the March of Dimes was John Harrison Finger, a textile worker in High Point, North Carolina. In 1948, his daughter came home from school and asked for a donation for the polio fund. Finger replied that he did not have the money but that he would raise some. In what is thought to be the first walkathon in March of Dimes history, Finger walked 32 miles — round trip from High Point to Greensboro — and collected a total of $1,700 in a red wagon he pulled behind him. During his lifetime he walked more than 1,000 miles and raised $15,832 to benefit the charity. The March of Dimes formally created its nationwide WalkAmerica drive in 1971, and Finger was named \"Mr. WalkAmerica\" in 1983.\n\nOnce rare in the United States, cases of pertussis (whooping cough) are appearing across the country with greater frequency. To address this issue, the March of Dimes and Sanofi Pasteur launched a national education campaign in 2010 called \"Sounds of Pertussis\" to raise awareness about the seriousness of pertussis and the need for adult vaccination to prevent infecting babies. NASCAR driver Jeff Gordon is a national spokesperson for the campaign. The campaign recently sponsored a song-writing contest called Sound Off About Pertussis, which was won by Maria Bennett with her original song, \"Give Pertussis a Whooping.\"\n\nTo combat the state's high prematurity levels, in 2007, the March of Dimes, the Johnson & Johnson Pediatric Institute, and the Kentucky Department for Public Health partnered with six Kentucky hospitals to launch \"Healthy Babies Are Worth the Wait,\" a health promotion and prematurity prevention initiative intended to reduce the rate of preventable preterm births in targeted areas of Kentucky. Kentucky was chosen as a pilot due to an elevated preterm birth rate greater than the national average that had been steadily increasing over the past few years, its predisposition to adjustable risk factors such as smoking and nutrition, and the commitment and dedication of community leaders. In 2007–2009, the trial programs saw a 6.5% reduction in preterm birth rates. The success of the program in the State of Kentucky led to the development of similar initiatives in New Jersey, Texas, New York, Kansas, and Illinois with upcoming sites in Florida and California.\n\nThe primary goal of Healthy Babies Are Worth the Wait is a 15 percent reduction in the rate of singleton (one baby) preterm births in these targeted areas through increasing knowledge and education regarding factors that increase the risks of preterm birth, influencing change in health care settings and creating new advancements in preventing preterm and low-birth-weight births. Other strategic goals include improving access to prenatal services and lowering the rate of early elective deliveries done before 39 weeks gestation. The Healthy Babies are Worth the Wait initiative was developed based on five core concepts: Partnerships and collaborations, Provider initiatives, Patient support, Public engagement, and Progress measurement. The program encourages providers to educate patients on the risk factors and prevention methods for preterm births, inform women of childbearing age of the challenges of delivering prematurely, and distribute public information regarding the costs of prematurity on society ($26 million annually). Program initiatives and services include progesterone shots given to pregnant women with past histories of preterm births, encouraging folic acid usage and stress management during pregnancy, and developing strategies to eliminate cesarean deliveries and inductions before 39 week's gestation unless medically necessary. The program was implemented as a Best Practice in the Association of Maternal & Child Health Programs (AMCHP) in 2015.\n\nThe March of Dimes Perinatal Data Center includes the PeriStats Web site, which provides free access to U.S., state, county, and city maternal and infant health data.\n\n\nVirginia Apgar, M.D., the creator of the Apgar Score, joined the March of Dimes in 1959 and eventually served as vice president for medical affairs.\n\nAnimal rights organizations have raised concerns about March of Dimes-funded medical research involving animals. The foundation states it supports the use of non-animal research alternatives wherever possible.\n\nIn his book \"Essentials of Sociology: A Down-to-Earth Approach\", sociologist Professor James M. Henslin describes March of Dimes as a bureaucracy that has taken on a life of its own through a classic example of a process called goal displacement. Faced with redundancy after Jonas Salk discovered the polio vaccine, it adopted a new mission, \"fighting birth defects\", which was recently changed to a vaguer goal of \"breakthrough for babies\", rather than disbanding.\n\nCharity Navigator, an organization that attempts to quantify the effectiveness of charities, has given the organization a rating of two stars (out of four). This is a merged score that attributes both a Financial as well as Accountability & Transparency rating to a non-profit. As of Fiscal Year 2015, Charity Navigator gives a 60.18 out of 100 score for Financial and a 97.00 out of 100 for Accountability & Transparency. This gives the March of Dimes a merged score of 71.76, leading to their two star status.\n\nAnother criticism has been that President Jennifer Howse's compensation is high. In 2011, the March of Dimes' tax filings reported it as $545,982, and the organization's filings from 2014 reported her salary as $503,692, about 25% higher than the median CEO salary for similarly sized charities.\n\n"}

Pediatric ophthalmologists also have expertise in managing the various ocular diseases that affect children. Pediatric ophthalmologists are qualified to perform complex eye surgery as well as to manage children's eye problems using glasses and medications. Many ophthalmologists and other physicians refer pediatric patients to a pediatric ophthalmologist for examination and management of ocular problems due to children's unique needs. In addition to children with obvious vision problems, children with head turns, head tilts, squinting of the eyes, or preferred head postures (torticollis) are typically referred to a pediatric ophthalmologist for evaluation. Pediatric ophthalmologists typically also manage adults with eye movement disorders (such as nystagmus or strabismus) due to their familiarity with strabismus conditions.\n\nChildren experience a variety of eye problems, many quite distinct from adult eye diseases.

They are usually set up as not-for-profit trusts, and have as their goal the improvement of their population's health.\n\nIn the early 1990s, general practitioners (GPs) were joining together to form independent practitioner associations (IPAs). They did this to better negotiate with the purchasers of healthcare at that time.\n\nPrior to the introduction of PHOs, general practitioners were paid using a fee-for-service model. For every person that went through their door, the GP received a set amount of money from the state. For some time, the Government had been trying to introduce a capitation model, that is, give practices a set amount of money depending on the population they served. The formation of the voluntary IPAs gave the Government an important stepping stone to introduce capitation-based funding. \n\nThe Government introduced PHOs, which were similar to the IPAs, in 2001, with the first PHOs being formed in July 2002. There were 81 PHOs by 2010 but some have since merged.\n\nA PHO is set up as a not-for-profit organisation with both community and provider representation. They maintain a list of their enrolled populations for which they get funding. PHOs include not just GPs and nurses, but also other health providers.\n\nPrimary health organisations are allocated funds depending on the characteristics of their enrolled population (this is called capitation).\n\nThe PHO receives a set amount of money from the district health board for every member, depending on their age, sex, ethnicity and socioeconomic status. They are also allocated funds for health promotion, individuals with special care requirements, as well as for rural practice.\n\nHealth care providers that are part of PHOs also have the right to charge fees to their patients for each visit. PHOs may also receive funding through contracting with the Ministry of Health, district health boards or other organisations such as Accident Compensation Corporation (ACC). Usually these contracts are to provide specific services or to pass on additional subsidies to target patient groups (over and above ordinary capitation subsidies).\n\nThis policy costs the Government more money to implement, and the expected proportion of each GP visit paid by the Government is higher than it has been previously. This means that generally New Zealanders can expect to pay less for a visit to the doctor.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

Lewis wrote it in early to mid-2005 and House of Anansi Press released it as the lecture series began in October 2005. Each of the book's chapters was delivered as one lecture in a different Canadian city, beginning in Vancouver on October 18 and ending in Toronto on October 28. The speeches were aired on CBC Radio One between November 7 and 11. The author and orator, Stephen Lewis, was at that time the United Nations Special Envoy for HIV/AIDS in Africa and former Canadian ambassador to the United Nations. Although he wrote the book and lectures in his role as a concerned Canadian citizen, his criticism of the United Nations (UN), international organizations, and other diplomats, including naming specific people, was called undiplomatic and led several reviewers to speculate whether he would be removed from his UN position.\n\nIn the book and the lectures, Lewis argues that significant changes are required to meet the Millennium Development Goals in Africa by their 2015 deadline. Lewis explains the historical context of Africa since the 1980s, citing a succession of disastrous economic policies by international financial institutions that contributed to, rather than reduced, poverty. He connects the structural adjustment loans, with conditions of limited public spending on health and education infrastructure, to the uncontrolled spread of AIDS and subsequent food shortages as the disease infected much of the working-age population. Lewis also addresses such issues as discrimination against women and primary education for children. To help alleviate problems, he ends with potential solutions which mainly require increased funding by G8 countries to levels beyond what they promise.\n\nBook reviewers found the criticisms constructive and the writing sincere. His style focuses less on numbers and statistics, and more on connecting decisions by UN officials and western diplomats to consequences on the ground in Africa. His eyewitness accounts are said to be candid and emotional. The book spent seven weeks at #1 on \"The Globe and Mail\"'s Nonfiction Bestseller List. A second edition was released in June 2006. The Canadian Booksellers Association awarded its Libris Award for non-fiction book of the year to \"Race Against Time\" and its Author of the Year Award to Lewis in 2006.\n\nAt the time of publication, the author, Stephen Lewis, aged 67 and living in Toronto, worked as the United Nations Special Envoy for HIV/AIDS in Africa, a position he held since 2001. Previously he worked as the Deputy Director of United Nations Children's Fund (1994–99), as the Canadian ambassador to the UN (1984–88), and as leader of the Ontario New Democratic Party (1970–79). After Lewis optimistically accepted the Special Envoy position he became increasingly distraught by the devastation he witnessed. Already a skilled orator, he became more vocal on the topic. He founded the Stephen Lewis Foundation, hosted Oprah Winfrey as she toured Africa, and was the subject of two award-winning documentaries by \"The Nature of Things\", entitled \"Race Against Time\" and \"The Value of Life\". Meanwhile he was invested as a Companion of the Order of Canada, awarded the Pearson Medal of Peace, and named Canadian of the Year (2003) by \"MacLean's\" magazine. In 2005, he was invited to deliver the annual series of Massey Lectures from which the book, \"Race Against Time\", was adapted. He wrote the text in early to mid- 2005 and delivered the lecture series in October when the book was released. Lewis wrote the book, not as an employee of the UN, but as a citizen concerned with the world's response to the AIDS challenge in Africa.\n\nThe book consists of five chapters, from which the five lectures were derived: Context, Pandemic, Education, Women, and Solutions. Before these chapters are sections titled Preface and Acknowledgments, and afterwards a Glossary section. The book's second edition contains an Afterword section written in May 2006. In the Preface, written by Lewis in August 2005, he states that his preferred genre is the spoken word and that the nature of the topic would not allow him to comprehensively cover every aspect. He justifies his writing by proclaiming himself a devotee to the United Nations and outlines the roles he has held with the organization since 1984. In the first chapter, Lewis tells anecdotes of visits to Africa and other UN-related events like, in 1986, brokering the resolutions from the General Assembly's 13th Special Session. He acknowledges colonialism and Cold War ideologues as historical influences on the African situation, but focuses on the effects of international finance institutions' conditional loans since the late 1980s.\n\nIn the second chapter Lewis discusses his history in Africa, beginning in the 1960s as an English teacher in Ghana. He contrasts Africa of the 1960s shedding colonial rule, optimistic in future prospects, with Africa of the 2000s struggling with AIDS and increasingly widespread hunger. He acknowledges the brain drain trend, noting \"there are more Malawian doctors in Manchester [England] than in Malawi\". In the third chapter Lewis examines how the UN, World Bank, and the International Monetary Fund (IMF) failed to fulfill promises of free access to primary education. In the instances where school entry fees were eliminated, additional fees (\"e.g.\" fees for uniforms, books, exams, and registration) had the same effect of limiting access. The fourth chapter elaborates on how women's issues are ignored or dismissed at international conferences and by African governments. Lewis identifies the gender discrimination that occurs even within the UN organization, whose management staff was dominated by males. He links the World Bank and IMF conditions of low social spending on education and healthcare by governments of recipient countries to the rampant spread of AIDS in those same countries. The disease decimated Africa's working age and farming population, leading to famine. He calls on the international financial institutions to pay \"reparations\" in the form of debt relief.\n\nLewis concludes that dramatic changes are required to meet the Millennium Development Goals by 2015. In the final chapter, he considers some potential measures that could help in Africa. He laments the shortfalls in funding by G8 countries, despite the continued renewed promises for full funding of Millennium Development Goal implementation. His proposed measures include:\n\nThe writing style reflects the author's intent to use the text for a lecture series. The narration addresses the audience while guiding it through explanations of the issues and anecdotal illustrations. Lewis' charismatic, eloquent, and energetic oration style is reflected in the writing. The tone has been described as loud and persuasive. One reviewer called it \"vintage Lewis – incisive criticism leavened with high-blown rhetoric\". The book focuses more upon real-world human experiences, rather than numbers and statistics, in discussing the effect of AIDS in sub-Saharan Africa and the world's response. Lewis' eyewitness accounts are candid and vivid. For example, he recounts tours of hospitals and schools as he explains the dire straits of national health and education sectors, and he describes meetings with diplomats and staff from the UN, World Bank, and IMF as he explains their effect on foreign aid policies. The book is written from an idealistic perspective and, despite the anger and underlying sense of guilt, Lewis remains optimistic. While he was a professional diplomat, his memoir-style reflections on specific people, such as Michel Camdessus, Carol Bellamy, and Thabo Mbeki were called undiplomatic. Despite the book's undiplomatic style, Lewis retained his post as a UN Special Envoy until the term completed in December 2006.\n\nThe book was released on October 18 as Lewis began the Massey lecture series in Vancouver. The second lecture took place in Winnipeg on the 20th, followed by Montreal on the 22nd, Halifax on the 26th, and the final one in Toronto two days later. The series was recorded then aired on CBC Radio One's \"Ideas\" between November 7 and 11. At each event Lewis fielded questions from the audience and participated in book signings. The publisher, House of Anansi Press, was on the last year of its contract with CBC to publish the Massey Lecture series; facing a competitive bid from Penguin Books, Anansi aggressively promoted \"Race Against Time\", with Lewis giving interviews to local media and attending receptions. CBC promoted the events nationally. Following an initial printing of 25,000 copies of the book by Anansi, along with the audio CDs produced by CBC Audio, there was a second printing in June 2006 with a new Afterword section.\n\nIn the Canadian market, \"Race Against Time\" debuted at #5 on \"The Globe and Mail\"'s Nonfiction Bestseller List on October 29. It spent seven weeks at #1, and forty weeks in the top ten. Excerpts from the book were published in \"The Globe and Mail\", \"The Montreal Gazette\", and \"Alternatives Journal\". At the Canadian Booksellers Association Libris Awards in June 2006, the book won non-fiction book of the year and Lewis won the Author of the Year Award. The book was short-listed for the Pearson Writers' Trust Prize and the Trillium Book Award.\n\nThe book was positively received by reviewers. The prose has been called magnificent, lucid, eloquent, and passionate. Lewis' emotional appeal has been called remarkably candid, sincere, powerful, and moving. Connecting the diplomatic and policy-level work of the UN and World Bank with specific effects on the ground in Africa, and describing the problem of orphans, were among the strengths of the book. Lewis' criticisms are constructive and, since they come from such an ardent multilateralist employed by the United Nations, authoritative. One reviewer questioned several of Lewis' potential solutions as contributing to the same system that consistently fails to address its flaws. The same reviewer identified as the book's weakness its political slant, which ignores corrupt or inefficient African governments and the realities of asking corporations and western governments to take steps against their self-interest, like canceling agricultural subsidies in the case of governments and donating profits in the case of businesses. Several reviewers noted that the book could be used as an effective tool to educate about the HIV/AIDS crisis and the plight of the people of sub-Saharan Africa.\n\nAn article in \"The New York Times\", in October 2005, reported on the book's criticism of South Africa's government, singling out President Thabo Mbeki and Health Minister Manto Tshabalala-Msimang. Lewis claimed that the South African programs were half-hearted and confusing; a spokesperson for the Health Ministry characterized Lewis as a biased and uninformed judge of South Africa's situation, and countered that they are rapidly expanding treatment programs. In August 2006, as a keynote speaker at the International AIDS Conference in Toronto, Lewis sustained his criticism, calling South Africa's government \"still obtuse, dilatory and negligent about rolling out treatment\".\n\n\n"}

The stability is presented as an implant stability quotient (ISQ) value. The higher the ISQ value the higher the stability.\n\nUtilizing RFA involves sending magnetic pulses to a small metal rod temporarily attached to the implant. As the rod vibrates, the probe reads its resonance frequency and translates it into an ISQ value.\n\nRFA measurements are used to assess the stability of the implant immediately after placement, as well as to measure the stability during the healing time. This helps the dentist determine if further healing time (osseointegration) is needed before the prosthetic tooth is attached, as well as to identify at-risk patients with compromised bone tissue, or other risk factors.\n\nResonance frequency analysis was first suggested as an alternative method of analyzing peri-implant bone in a scientific paper by Meredith N et al in 1996. As stated in the paper’s abstract, in measuring implant stability and osseointegration, “radiographs are of value, but a standardised technique is necessary to ensure repeatability.” The new technique tested involved connecting a small transducer (aluminum rod) to implants. Measurements showed that the resonance frequency increased in direct relation to the increase in the stiffness of the bone-implant interface, thus demonstrating a repeatable and quantitative method of assessing stability.\n\nThe method underwent further research and in 1999 the Sweden-based company Osstell AB formed to commercialize the new technique. Osstell developed a device that transmitted vibrational frequencies to a metal peg inserted in the implant and measured the frequency at which resonance was reached. Whereas Meredith et al. measured in the range of 3500–8500 kHz, Osstell developed the Implant Stability Quotient (ISQ) that translated this kHz range to a score 1–100.\n\nResonance frequency analysis has considerable scientific interest since its advent, largely owing to the increasing number of patients demanding dental implants as the technology improves. As it is a non-invasive and objective way to evaluate short- and long-term implant viability, RFA is an increasingly utilized method.\n\nThe method that preceded RFA, percussion or “tapping,” may be used to understand the underlying functionality of RFA devices as the same principles are at work. When an implant was percussed with a blunt instrument, the nature of the sound elicited would qualitatively indicate the level of the implant’s stability. A low pitched, dull sound (low frequency) indicated a loose bond with the bone, as the vibrations moved slower across the distance between the implant and surrounding tissue. A high pitched, crystalline sound indicated a tight connection along the implant-bone interface, with vibrations moving quicker across a more restricted area. The dentist would make a qualitative assessment of the level of stability based on the sound heard.\n\nWith RFA, vibrations are being used to determine stability, but on a micro scale and in a non-invasive manner. A metal peg (transducer) with a magnet top is attached to the implant. Magnetic pulses (alternating sine waves of uniform amplitude) cause the peg to vibrate, increasing steadily in pitch until the implant resonates. The higher the resonant frequency, the more stable the implant.\n\nThe frequency readings, translated to an Implant Stability Quotient (ISQ), are used as an assessment and ongoing monitoring tool. Medical interpretations of ISQ values may then be used to inform treatment plans, as analyzed and documented in hundreds of clinical studies.\n\nA reading of 55 or below indicates that too much lateral movement is possible, and the implant needs to reach secondary stability (greater bonding with the bone) before the prosthesis may be attached. If the resonance frequency reading increases, it signals that osseointegration is occurring. Along with other diagnostic tools, measurements over time can be used to indicate the rate of osseointegration, and treatment plans may be assigned accordingly. If the rate is initially low and does not increase, it signals the implant is not viable.\n"}
{"id": "938121", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=938121", "title": "Sanatorium", "text": "Sanatorium\n\nA sanatorium (also spelled sanitorium and sanitarium) is a medical facility for long-term illness, most typically associated with treatment of tuberculosis (TB) in the late-nineteenth and twentieth century before the discovery of antibiotics. A distinction is sometimes made between \"sanitarium\" (a kind of health resort, as in the Battle Creek Sanitarium) and \"sanatorium\" (a hospital).\n\nThe first suggestion of sanatoria in the modern sense was likely made by George Bodington, who opened a sanatorium in Sutton Coldfield in 1836 and later published his essay, On the Treatment and Cure of Pulmonary Consumption, in 1840. His novel approach was dismissed as \"very crude ideas and unsupported assertions\" by reviewers in the Lancet, and his sanatorium was converted to an asylum soon after. The rationale for sanatoria in the pre-antibiotic era was that a regimen of rest and good nutrition offered the best chance that the sufferer's immune system would \"wall off\" pockets of pulmonary TB infection. In 1863, Hermann Brehmer opened the \"Brehmersche Heilanstalt für Lungenkranke\" in Görbersdorf (Sokołowsko), Silesia (now Poland), for the treatment of tuberculosis. Patients were exposed to plentiful amounts of high altitude, fresh air, and good nutrition. Tuberculosis sanatoria became common throughout Europe from the late-19th century onward.\n\nThe Adirondack Cottage Sanitarium, established in Saranac Lake, New York, in 1885, was the first such establishment in North America. According to the Saskatchewan Lung Association, when the National Anti-Tuberculosis Association (Canada) was founded in 1904, its members, including renowned pioneer in the fight against tuberculosis Dr. R.G. Ferguson, believed that a distinction should be made between the health resorts with which people were familiar and the new tuberculosis treatment hospitals: \"So they decided to use a new word which instead of being derived from the Latin noun \"sanitas\", meaning health, would emphasize the need for scientific healing or treatment. Accordingly, they took the Latin verb root \"sano\", meaning to heal, and adopted the new word sanatorium.\"\n\nSwitzerland used to have many sanatoria, as health professionals believed that clean, cold mountain air was the best treatment for lung diseases. In Finland, a series of tuberculosis sanatoria were built throughout the country in isolated forest areas during the early 1900s. The most famous was the Paimio Sanatorium, completed in 1933, designed by world-renowned architect Alvar Aalto. It had both sun-balconies and a rooftop terrace where the patients would lie all day either in beds or on specially designed chairs, the Paimio Chair. In Portugal, the Heliantia Sanatorium in Valadares, was used for the treatment of bone tuberculosis between the 1930s and 1960s.\n\nIn the early 20th century, tuberculosis sanatoria became common in the United States. In the early 1900s, Arizona's sunshine and dry desert air attracted many people (called \"lungers\") suffering from tuberculosis, rheumatism, asthma, and numerous other diseases. Wealthier people chose to recuperate in exclusive TB resorts, while others used their savings to make the journey to Arizona and arrived penniless. TB camps in the desert were formed by pitching tents and building cabins. During the tuberculosis epidemic, cities in Arizona advertised the state as an ideal place for treatment of TB. Many sanatoria in the state of Arizona were modeled after European away-from-city resorts of the time, boasting courtyards and individual rooms. Each sanatorium was equipped to take care of about 120 people. \n\nThe first sanatorium in the Pacific Northwest opened in Milwaukie Heights, Oregon in 1905. Followed closely by the first state-owned TB hospital in Salem, Oregon, in 1910. Oregon was the first state on the West Coast to enact legislation stating that the government was to supply proper housing for people with TB who are unable to receive proper care at home. The West Coast became a popular spot for sanatoriums. \n\nThe greatest area for sanatoria was in Tucson with over 12 hotel-style facilities in the city. By 1920, Tucson had 7,000 people who had come for treatment of tuberculosis. So many people came to the West that not enough housing was available for them all. In 1910, tent cities began to pop up in different areas; one was described as a place of squalor and shunned by most citizens. Many of the infected slept in the open desert. The area adjacent to what was then central Phoenix, called Sunnyslope, was home to another large TB encampment, with the residents primarily living in tents pitched along the hillsides of the mountains that rise to the north of the city. Several sanatoria also opened in southern California in the early party of the 20th century due to the dry, warm climate.\n\nThe first tuberculosis sanatorium for blacks in the segregated South was the Piedmont Sanatorium in Burkeville, Virginia. Waverly Hills Sanatorium, a Louisville, Kentucky, tuberculosis sanatorium, was founded in 1911. It has become a mecca for curiosity seekers who believe it is haunted. Because of its dry climate, Colorado Springs was home to several sanatoria. A. G. Holley Hospital in Lantana, Florida, was the last remaining freestanding tuberculosis sanatorium in the United States until it closed on July 2, 2012.\n\nIn 1907, Stannington Sanatorium was open in the North East of England to treat tuberculosis in children. The sanatorium was opened using funds raised by a local charity, the Poor Children's Holiday Association, now the region's oldest children's charity, Children North East.\n\nAfter 1943, when Albert Schatz, then a graduate student at Rutgers University, discovered streptomycin, an antibiotic and the first cure for tuberculosis, sanatoria began to close. As in the case of the Paimio Sanatorium, many were transformed into general hospitals. By the 1950s, tuberculosis was no longer a major public health threat; it was controlled by antibiotics rather than extended rest. Most sanatoria were demolished years before.\n\nSome, however, have been adapted for new medical roles. The Tambaram Sanatorium in south India is now a hospital for AIDS patients. The state hospital in Sanatorium, Mississippi, is now a regional center for programs for treatment and occupational therapy associated with intellectual disability. In Japan in 2001, the ministry of welfare suggested changing the names of a leprosarium to a sanatorium. \n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "97120", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=97120", "title": "Sekhmet", "text": "Sekhmet\n\nIn Egyptian mythology, Sekhmet ( or Sachmis (), also spelled Sakhmet, Sekhet, or Sakhet, among other spellings, is a warrior goddess as well as goddess of healing. She is depicted as a lioness, the fiercest hunter known to the Egyptians. It was said that her breath formed the desert. She was seen as the protector of the pharaohs and led them in warfare. \n\nSekhmet is also a solar deity, sometimes called the daughter of Ra and often associated with the goddesses Hathor and Bastet. She bears the Uraeus, which associates her with Wadjet and royalty, and the solar disk.\n\nSekhmet's name comes from the Ancient Egyptian word \"sekhem\", which means \"power or might\". Sekhmet's name is thus translated as \"the (one who is) powerful or mighty\". She also was given titles such as the \"(One) Before Whom Evil Trembles\", \"Mistress of Dread\", \"Lady of Slaughter\" and \"She Who Mauls\".\n\nIn order to placate Sekhmet's wrath, her priestesses performed a ritual before a different statue of the goddess on each day of the year. This practice resulted in many images of the goddess being preserved. Most of her statuettes were rigidly crafted and do not exhibit any expression of movements or dynamism; this design was made to make them last a long time rather than to express any form of functions or actions she is associated with. It is estimated that more than seven hundred statues of Sekhmet once stood in one funerary temple alone, that of Amenhotep III, on the west bank of the Nile.\n\nShe was envisioned as a fierce lioness, and in art, was depicted as such, or as a woman with the head of a lioness, who was dressed in red, the color of blood. Sometimes the dress she wears exhibits a rosetta pattern over each breast, an ancient leonine motif, which can be traced to observation of the shoulder-knot hairs on lions. Occasionally, Sekhmet was also portrayed in her statuettes and engravings with minimal clothing or naked. Tame lions were kept in temples dedicated to Sekhmet at Leontopolis.\n\nTo pacify Sekhmet, festivals were celebrated at the end of battle, so that the destruction would come to an end. During an annual festival held at the beginning of the year, a festival of intoxication, the Egyptians danced and played music to soothe the wildness of the goddess and drank great quantities of wine ritually to imitate the extreme drunkenness that stopped the wrath of the goddess—when she almost destroyed humanity. This may relate to averting excessive flooding during the inundation at the beginning of each year as well, when the Nile ran blood-red with the silt from up-stream and Sekhmet had to swallow the overflow to save humankind.\n\nIn 2006, Betsy Bryan, an archaeologist with Johns Hopkins University excavating at the temple of Mut presented her findings about the festival that included illustrations of the priestesses being served to excess and its adverse effects being ministered to by temple attendants. Participation in the festival was great, including the priestesses and the population. Historical records of tens of thousands attending the festival exist. These findings were made in the temple of Mut because when Thebes rose to greater prominence, Mut absorbed some characteristics of Sekhmet. These temple excavations at Luxor discovered a \"porch of drunkenness\" built onto the temple by the Pharaoh Hatshepsut, during the height of her twenty-year reign.\n\nIn a myth about the end of Ra's rule on the earth, Ra sends Hathor as Sekhmet to destroy mortals who conspired against him. In the myth, Sekhmet's blood-lust was not quelled at the end of battle and led to her destroying almost all of humanity, so Ra poured out beer dyed with red ochre or hematite so that it resembled blood. Mistaking the beer for blood, she became so drunk that she gave up the slaughter and returned peacefully to Ra. The same myth was also described in the prognosis texts of the Calendar of Lucky and Unlucky Days of papyrus Cairo 86637, where the actions of Sekhmet, Horus, Ra and Wadjet were connected to the eclipsing binary Algol.\n\nSekhmet later was considered to be the mother of Maahes, a deity who appeared during the New Kingdom period. He was seen as a lion prince, the son of the goddess. The late origin of Maahes in the Egyptian pantheon may be the incorporation of a Nubian deity of ancient origin in that culture, arriving during trade and warfare or even, during a period of domination by Nubia. During the Greek dominance in Egypt, note was made of a temple for Maahes that was an auxiliary facility to a large temple to Sekhmet at Taremu in the delta region (likely a temple for Bast originally), a city which the Greeks called Leontopolis, where by that time, an enclosure was provided to house lions.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "1145905", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1145905", "title": "Tooth whitening", "text": "Tooth whitening\n\nTooth whitening (termed tooth bleaching when utilising bleach), is either the restoration of a natural tooth shade or whitening beyond the natural shade.\n\nRestoration of the underlying natural tooth shade is possible by simply removing surface stains caused by extrinsic factors, stainers such as tea, coffee, red wine and tobacco. The buildup of calculus and tartar can also influence the staining of teeth. This restoration of the natural tooth shade is achieved by having the teeth cleaned by a dental professional (commonly termed \"scaling and polishing\"), or at home by various oral hygiene methods. Calculus and tartar are difficult to remove without a professional clean.\n\nTo whiten the natural tooth shade, bleaching is suggested. It is a common procedure in cosmetic dentistry, and a number of different techniques are used by dental professionals. There is a plethora of products marketed for home use to do this also. Techniques include bleaching strips, bleaching pens, bleaching gels and laser tooth whitening. Bleaching methods generally use either hydrogen peroxide or carbamide peroxide which breaks down into hydrogen peroxide.\n\nThe perception of tooth color is the result of a complex interaction of factors such as: lighting conditions, translucency, opacity, light scattering, gloss, the human eye and brain. Teeth are composed of a surface enamel layer, which is whiter and semitransparent, and an underlying dentin layer, which is darker and less transparent. These are calcified, hard tissues comparable to bone. The natural shade of teeth is best considered as such; an off-white, bone-color rather than pure white. Public opinion of what is normal tooth shade tends to be distorted. Portrayals of cosmetically enhanced teeth are common in the media. In one report, the most common tooth shade in the general population ranged from A1 to A3 on the VITA classical A1-D4 shade guide.\n\nFemales generally have slightly whiter teeth than males, partly because females' teeth are smaller, and therefore there is less bulk of dentin, partially visible through the enamel layer. For the same reason, larger teeth such as the molars and the canine (cuspid) teeth tend to be darker. Baby teeth (deciduous teeth) are generally whiter than the adult teeth that follow, again due to differences in the ratio of enamel to dentin. As a person ages the adult teeth often become darker due to changes in the mineral structure of the tooth, as the enamel becomes less porous and phosphate-deficient. The enamel layer may also be gradually thinned or even perforated by the various forms of tooth wear.\n\nTeeth may be darkened by a buildup of surface stains (extrinsic staining), which hides the natural tooth color; or the tooth itself may discolor (intrinsic staining).\n\nExtrinsic stains can become internalised through enamel defects or cracks or as a result of dentine becoming exposed but most extrinsic stains appear to be deposited on or in the dental pellicle. Causes of extrinsic staining include:\n\nChanges in the thickness of the dental hard tissues would result in intrinsic discolouration. There are a few causal factors that may act locally or systematically, affecting only a single tooth or all teeth and cause discolouration as a result. Several diseases that are known to affect the developing dentition especially during enamel and dentine formation can lead to discolouration. Causes of intrinsic staining include:\nCauses of extrinsic and intrinsic staining include:\n\nWhitening methods can usually be divided into two types. The first type includes methods that removes surface stains from teeth and includes toothpastes, air polishing and micro abrasion. The second type removes stains that have penetrated the enamel and therefore cannot be removed by the first type. The second type is referred to as \"bleaching\", typically using either hydrogen peroxide or carbamide peroxide which breaks down into hydrogen peroxide.\n\nBleaching solutions generally contain hydrogen peroxide or carbamide peroxide, which bleaches the enamel dentine junction to change its color. The peroxide penetrates the porosities in the rod-like crystal structure of enamel and breaks down stain deposits in the dentin.\n\nBefore the treatment, the dentist may examine the patient: taking a health and dental history (including allergies and sensitivities), observe hard and soft tissues, placement and conditions of restorations, and sometimes x-rays to determine the nature and depth of possible irregularities.\n\nThe whitening shade guides are used to measure tooth color. These shades determine the effectiveness of the whitening procedure, which may vary from two to seven shades. The effects of bleaching can last for several months, but may vary depending on the lifestyle of the patient. Consuming tooth staining foods or drinks that have a strong colour may compromise effectiveness of the treatment. These include; coffee, fizzy drinks, red-colored sauces etc.\n\nIn-office bleaching procedures generally use a light-cured protective layer that is carefully painted on the gums and papilla (the tips of the gums between the teeth) to reduce the risk of chemical burns to the soft tissues. The bleaching agent is either carbamide peroxide, which breaks down in the mouth to form hydrogen peroxide, or hydrogen peroxide itself. The bleaching gel typically contains between 10% and 44% carbamide peroxide, which is roughly equivalent to a 3% to 16% hydrogen peroxide concentration. The legal percentage of hydrogen peroxide allowed to be given is 0.1-6%. Bleaching agents are only allowed to be given via dental practitioners, dental therapists and dental hygienists.\n\nBleaching is least effective when the original tooth color is grayish and may require custom bleaching trays. Bleaching is most effective with yellow discolored teeth. If heavy staining or tetracycline damage is present on a patient's teeth, and whitening is ineffective (tetracycline staining may require prolonged bleaching, as it takes longer for the bleach to reach the dentine layer), there are other methods of masking the stain. Bonding, which also masks tooth stains, is when a thin coating of composite material is applied to the front of a person's teeth and then cured with a blue light. A veneer can also mask tooth discoloration.\n\nThe advantages of this technique are that the results happen at one sitting at the dentist, it does not take a longer time for results to show like it does when the home bleaching technique is used. This is good if fast, effective results are required.\n\nHowever the disadvantages of this technique is that this is a one off treatment and if further whitening is needed the treatment will need to be carried out all over again. However, with at home bleaching, more bleaching gel can be purchased from the dentist and the same trays can be used, as long as they are intact and have no holes in them.\n\nPower or light-accelerated bleaching, sometimes colloquially referred to as laser bleaching (a common misconception since lasers are an older technology that was used before current technologies were developed), uses light energy which is intended to accelerate the process of bleaching in a dental office. Different types of energy can be used in this procedure, with the most common being halogen, LED, or plasma arc. Use of light during bleaching increases the risk of tooth sensitivity and may not be any more effective than bleaching without light when high concentrations of hydrogen peroxide are used. Recent research has shown that the use of a light activator does not improve bleaching, has no measurable effect and most likely to increase the temperature of the associated tissues, resulting in damage.\n\nThe ideal source of energy should be high energy to excite the peroxide molecules without overheating the pulp of the tooth. Lights are typically within the blue light spectrum as this has been found to contain the most effective wavelengths for initiating the hydrogen peroxide reaction. A power bleaching treatment typically involves isolation of soft tissue with a resin-based, light-curable barrier, application of a professional dental-grade hydrogen peroxide whitening gel (25-38% hydrogen peroxide), and exposure to the light source for 6–15 minutes. Recent technical advances have minimized heat and ultraviolet emissions, allowing for a shorter patient preparation procedure.\n\nIn-office, the teeth are polished using pumice, the bleaching agent is added. The teeth are washed with a lot of water then polished again.\n\nIt is recommended to avoid smoking, drinking red wine, eating or drinking any deeply coloured foods after this as the teeth may stain considerably straight after treatment.\n\nA recent addition to the field is new light-accelerated bleaching agents containing lower concentrations of hydrogen peroxide with a titanium oxide nanoparticle based catalyst. Reduced concentrations of hydrogen peroxide cause lower incidences of tooth hypersensitivity. The nanoparticles act as photocatalysts, and their size prevents them from diffusing deeply into the tooth. When exposed to light, the catalysts produce a rapid, localized breakdown of hydrogen peroxide into highly reactive radicals. Due to the extremely short lifetimes of the free radicals, they are able to produce bleaching effects similar to much higher concentration bleaching agents within the outer layers of the teeth where the nanoparticle catalysts are located. This provides effective tooth whitening while reducing the required concentration of hydrogen peroxide and other reactive byproducts at the tooth pulp.\n\nInternal staining of dentine can discolor the teeth from inside out. Internal bleaching can remedy this on root canal treated teeth. Internal bleaching procedures are performed on devitalized teeth that have undergone endodontic treatment (root canal treatment) but are discolored due to internal staining of the tooth structure by blood and other fluids that leaked in. Unlike external bleaching, which brightens teeth from the outside in, internal bleaching brightens teeth from the inside out. Bleaching the tooth internally involves drilling a hole to the pulp chamber no more than 2mm below the gingival margin, cleaning any infected or discoloured dentine, sealing, and filling the root canal with gutta-percha points, cleaning the inside of the canal using etchant and placing a peroxide gel or sodium perborate tetrahydrate into the pulp chamber so they can work directly inside the tooth on the dentine layer. In this variation of whitening the whitening agent is sealed within the tooth over a period of some days and replaced as needed, the so-called \"walking bleach\" technique.. A seal should be placed over the root filling material to minimise microleakage. There is a small risk of external resorption.\n\nAn alternative to the walking bleach procedure is the inside-out bleach where the bleaching cavity is left open and the patient issued with a custom-formed tray to place and retain the agent, typically a carbamide peroxide gel inside the cavity. The patient changes the gel over 24 hours and uses a tray to retain it, they return to the dentist where this is sealed. On review once sufficient shade change has occurred the access cavity can be sealed, typically with a dental composite.\n\nAt-home whitening methods include gels, chewing gums, rinses, toothpastes, paint-on films, and whitening strips. Most over-the-counter methods utilize either carbamide peroxide or hydrogen peroxide. Although there is some evidence that such products will whiten the teeth compared to placebo, the majority of the published scientific studies were short term and are subject to a high risk of bias as the research was sponsored or conducted by the manufacturers. There is no long term evidence of the effectiveness or potential risks of such products. Any demonstrable difference in the short term efficiency of such products seems to be related to concentration of the active ingredient.\n\nNight guard vital bleaching is another increasingly popular method of dentist prescribed at home teeth whitening. These methods have gained popularity due to the fact that significant results can be achieved overnight without the removal of any tooth tissue making it a conservative method of lightening tooth shade.The process of night guard vital bleaching involves alginate impressions of the patients’ teeth in the first visit, this is then casted into stone and a custom-made vacuum form tray is made. The patient is provided with bleaching solution, which is placed into the tray for use overnight. The number of nights the tray is used would be dependent on the extent of staining and the shade desired by the patient. \nDue to the recent spike in the use of home teeth whitening products there is a lack of research regarding long term implications such as side effects and duration of results. Research has found that ‘nightguard vital bleaching is a safe, effective, and predictable method to lighten teeth. The whitening effect lasted up to 47 months in 82% of the patients, with no adverse side effects reported at the end of the study’.\n\nWhitening toothpastes are different to regular toothpastes in a way that they contain a higher content of abrasives and detergents to fight off tougher stains. Most contain low concentrations of carbamide/hydrogen peroxide (bleaching agents) – this lightens the colour of teeth. These whitening toothpastes make teeth one to two shades lighter. Toothpastes (dentifrices) which are advertised as \"whitening\" rarely contain carbamide peroxide, hydrogen peroxide or any other bleaching agent. Rather, they are abrasive (usually containing alumina, dicalcium phosphate dehydrate, calcium carbonate or silica), intended to remove surface stains from the tooth surface. Sometimes they contain enzymes purported to break down the biofilm on teeth. Unlike bleaches, whitening toothpaste does not alter the intrinsic color of teeth. Excessive or long term use of abrasive toothpastes will cause dental abrasion, thinning the enamel layer and slowly darkening the appearance of the tooth as the dentine layer becomes more noticeable. An alternative method of whitening at home, which competes with the use of a whitening paste, is the use of a patent whitening mouthwash. The mouthwash shows marginally better efforts at whitening compared to the use of paste.\n\nWhitening strips work by the placement of a layer of peroxide gel on the labial surfaces of teeth through the use of plastic strips that are shaped to fit there. Many different types of whitening strips are available on the market, after being introduced in the late 1980s. Each variety of whitening strips has its own set of instructions to suit the product, for example, different strips can be used at different frequencies to reach the same whitening end point.\n\nWhitening gels are also peroxide based, like the strips, and applied straight onto the tooth surfaces via the use of a small brush. Following manufacturer’s instructions they can lighten teeth by 1-2 shades.\n\nAnother method used by people at home to whiten teeth is the use of whitening rinses - these contain oxygen sources, like hydrogen peroxide. To see a 1 -2 improvement in tooth shade could take up to 3 months.\n\nOne purported method of naturally whitening the teeth is through the use of malic acid. The juice of apples, especially green apples, contains malic acid. On the other hand, excessive consumption of acidic beverages will slowly dissolve the enamel layer, making the underlying yellower dentine show through more noticeably, leading to darkening of the tooth's appearance. One study indicates that malic acid is a weak tooth whitening agent.\n\n\nSome groups are advised to carry out tooth whitening with caution as they may be at higher risk of adverse effects.\n\n\nThe most common side effects associated with tooth bleaching are increased sensitivity of the teeth and irritation of the gums, which tend to resolve once the bleaching is stopped.\n\nThe low pH of bleach opens up dentinal tubules and may result in dentine hypersensitivity, bringing about hypersensitive teeth. It manifests as increased sensitivity to stimuli such as hot, cold or sweet. 67 – 78% of the patients experience teeth sensitivity after in office bleaching with hydrogen peroxide in combination with heat. Sensitivity of teeth can persist up to 4 days after teeth bleaching cessation. However, it varies from person to person. A longer duration of hypersensitivity has been reported 39 days post-bleaching.\n\nRecurrent treatments or use of desensitising toothpastes may alleviate discomfort, though there may be occurrences where the severity of pain discontinues further treatment. Potassium nitrate and sodium fluoride are used to reduce tooth sensitivity following bleaching.\n\nHydrogen peroxide is an irritant and cytotoxic. At concentrations of 10% or higher, hydrogen peroxide is potentially corrosive to mucous membranes or skin and can cause a burning sensation and tissue damage. Chemical burns from gel bleaching (if a high-concentration oxidising agent contacts unprotected tissues, which may bleach or discolor mucous membranes). Tissue irritation most commonly results from an ill-fitting mouthpiece tray rather than the tooth-bleaching agent.\n\nAfter teeth bleaching, it is normal to have uneven results. With time, the color will appear more even. To avoid this from happening it is important to avoid making some common post-bleaching mistakes, such as consuming foods and beverages that stain the surface of your teeth.\n\nNearly half the initial change in color provided by an intensive in-office treatment (i.e., 1 hour treatment in a dentist's chair) may be lost in seven days. Rebound is experienced when a large proportion of the tooth whitening has come from tooth dehydration (also a significant factor in causing sensitivity). As the tooth rehydrates, tooth color \"rebounds\", back toward where it started.\n\nOverbleaching, known in the profession as \"bleached effect\", particularly with the intensive treatments (products that provide a large change in tooth colour over a very short treatment period, e.g., an hour). Too much bleaching will cause the teeth to appear very translucent.\n\nHome tooth bleaching treatments can have significant negative effects on tooth enamel. Study has been done and there is evidence that high concentration of carbamide peroxide can damage the enamel surface. Although the effect on enamel is less detrimental than seen after phosphoric acid etch, the increased roughness of the surface may make teeth more susceptible to extrinsic discolouration after bleaching.\n\nIntracoronal bleaching with 30% hydrogen peroxide decreases the micro-hardness of dentin. Thus, weakening the mechanical properties.\n\nDental Amalgam – Exposure to carbamide peroxide solutions increase mercury release for one to two days.\n\nResin Composite – bond strength between enamel and resin based fillings weakened.\n\nGlass Ionomer and other cements – Study suggesting that solubility of these materials may increase.\n\nWhen bleaching is abused and an individual develops an unhealthy obsession with whitening, the term \"bleachorexia\" or \"whitening junky\" has been used. The condition is characterized by repeated bleaching even though the teeth are already white and will not get any whiter. This condition is somewhat similar to body dismorphic disorder. The individual perceives their teeth never to be white enough, despite repeated bleaching. A person with bleachorexia will typically continually request more bleaching services or products from the dental professional. It has been recommended that a target shade be agreed before starting bleaching treatment to help with this problem.\n\nHydrogen peroxide might act as a tumour promoter. Intracoronal internal bleaching may also cause cervical root resorption, it is more commonly observed in teeth that are treated with thermo-catalytic bleaching method. Due to extensive removal of intracoronal dentin, tooth crown fracture can happen after intracoronal bleaching.\n\nThe International Agency of Research on Cancer (IARC) has concluded that there is insufficient evidence for the carcinogeni-city of hydrogen peroxide. The chemical is now under Group 3: Unclassifiable as to carcinogenicity to humans. The genotoxic potential of hydrogen peroxide has been evaluated recently. Oral health products that contain or release hydrogen peroxide up to 3.6% HO is not likely to increase cancer risk in individuals.\n\nAlthough treatment results can be rapid, stains can reappear within the first few months and years of treatment. In order to maintain the whitened appearance, there are ways to protect the teeth and prolong the treatment.\n\nThere has been interest in white teeth since ancient times. Ancient Romans used urine and goat milk in an attempt to make and keep their teeth whiter. Guy de Chauliac suggested the following to whiten the teeth: \"Clean the teeth gently with a mixture of honey and burnt salt to which some vinegar has been added.\" In 1877 oxalic acid was proposed for whitening, followed by calcium hypochlorite. Peroxide was first used for tooth whitening in 1884.\n\nTeeth whitening has become the most marketed and requested procedure in cosmetic dentistry. More than 100 million Americans whiten their teeth one way or another; spending an estimated $15 billion in 2010. The US Food and Drug Administration only approves gels that are under 6% hydrogen peroxide or 16% or less of carbamide peroxide. The Scientific Committee for Consumer Protection of the EU consider gels containing higher concentrations than these to be unsafe.\n\nAccording to a European Council regulation, only a qualified dental professional can legally provide tooth whitening products using 0.1 - 6% hydrogen peroxide, and that the patient must be at least 18 years old. Over recent years, there have been rising concerns over unlicensed staff providing poor quality tooth whitening treatment. Significant evidence has been gathered that tooth whitening procedures have been offered by beauty salons and health clinics under unskilled staff without dental qualifications. A group of recognised dental boards and organisations called The Tooth Whitening Information Group (TWIG) was established to promote safe and productive tooth whitening information and guidance for the benefit of the public. Reports can be made by the public to TWIG through their website regarding any individual providing illegal tooth whitening services, or if they personally undergone treatment done by an incompetent staff who is not a dental professional.\n\nIn Brazil, all bleaching products are classed as cosmetics (Degree II) in legislature. There are concerns that this will result in increasing misuse of bleaching products and consequently there have been calls for reclassification.\n\n"}

Traceability is an essential prerequisite for the co-existence of GM and non-GM foods, and for the freedom of choice for consumers.\n\nThe traceability of GMOs is founded on two needs. First, consumers in many countries are reluctant to buy genetically modified foods, and are skeptical of the use of GM crops for animal feed. Consequently, the concept of co-existence has been developed to separate GM and non-GM supply chains, and is only possible if all purchasers along the production chain know what they are buying. Secondly, although every GMO that is approved for commercialisation must have passed a safety assessment, it may be necessary to withdraw a certain GMO from the market - for example, if new scientific evidence raises doubts about its safety.\n\nFor these purposes, after three years of debate, the OECD countries came up with an identity code for GMOs in 2002. Initially, some member countries (for example, the USA, but also Canada and Australia) were opposed to the concept. The final decision requires the assignment of a \"unique identifier\" to each GMO event which is authorised in one or more OECD countries. The unique identifier is a code consisting of nine letters and/or numbers. The first two or three characters indicate the company submitting the application, while the following six or five characters specify the respective transformation event. The last digit serves as a verifier. All the crop varieties derived from one transformation event will share the same unique identifier.\n\nThe unique identifier has been integrated in the Cartagena Protocol on Biosafety and in the European Union legislation on the labelling and traceability of genetically modified organisms (Regulation (EC) No 1830/2003). Detailing the unique identifier, the regulation demands the forwarding of written documentation of the identity of a GMO at every stage of the production process. This allows a GMO to be traced even if, for example, due to intensive processing, it can no longer be detected. Using this unique identifier, information on all approved transgenic GMOs is accessible through the Biosafety Clearing-House, the information exchange platform of the Cartagena Protocol.\n\nTraceability does not rely solely on documentation. By biochemical means (polymerase chain reaction) even tiny traces of GMOs can be detected and identified—provided that suitable testing tools exist for the GMO assumed to be present. In the EU, such a tool must be part of the application documents for the approval for commercialisation. For most products and production stages, testing methods are available to monitor and enforce the compliance with traceability regulations.\n\n\n"}

He began a degree course in medicine at St Andrew's University but interrupted his studies to visit the West Indies, returning circa 1727. On 6 October 1727, he entered the University of Leyden to continue his studies under Boerhaave, graduating M.D. in 1729. It was during his time at Leyden that Houstoun became interested in the medicinal properties of plants. After returning to England that year, he soon sailed for the Caribbean and the Americas employed as a ship's surgeon for the South Sea Company. He collected plants in Jamaica, Cuba, Venezuela, and Vera Cruz, despatching seeds and plants to Philip Miller, head gardener at the Chelsea Physic Garden in London.

Held annually in Berlin, Germany during October, it gathers leaders from academia, science, politics and industry as well as stakeholders from the private sector and civil society.\n\nThe summit began in 2009 on the occasion of the 300th year anniversary of the Charité – Universitätsmedizin Berlin. The founders recognized that whilst similar gatherings of leaders were well established in fields such as economic development and technology, a global forum did not exist for medical practice, research and health care systems.\n\nThe summit was established under the patronage of the German chancellor, Angela Merkel, and the President of the French Republic, Nicolas Sarkozy. Sarkozy's successor, President Francois Hollande, continued the patronage as did Emmanuel Macron. They were joined in 2013 by José Manuel Barroso, President of the European Commission. Jean-Claude Juncker continued this patronage. Four ministries of the government of the Federal Republic of Germany directly support the summit (Health, Foreign Office, Education and Research, Economic Cooperation and Development).\n\nTraditionally, the German Federal Minister of Health attends the World Health Summit and holds a keynote in its opening ceremony. When being Governing Mayor of Berlin, Klaus Wowereit, was a regular attendee at the World Health Summit and prominent participant in its opening ceremonies as well.\n\nAccording to the World Health Summit's Mission Statement published in \"The Lancet\" in 2009, its mission is in keeping with the United Nations Declaration of Human Rights' (1948) acknowledgement of health as a fundamental human right. At present, more than half of the world's population is not receiving proper medical care, therefore the organizers of the World Health Summit see their mission as improving healthcare worldwide and promoting equitable access to medication and prevention. The achievement of this mission is seen as threatened by unsolved and newly emerging problems such as: \"the demographic shift to an ageing society; climate change and its health consequences that are already being felt; new types of epidemics, such as obesity, mental ill-health, and violence and injury, in developed and developing countries, it is eradicating the diseases of HIV, TB, and malaria; the rising costs of health care; and the worldwide economic crisis and its serious threats to the health of populations across the globe.\n\nThe World Health Summit seeks to actively address these challenges by bringing together stakeholders from research, education, clinical care and many other disciplines to jointly develop strategies to tackle these major health care issues. The outcome of each multi-sectoral Summit is intended to inform and influence decision-makers such as governments and supranational agencies, as recommendations for meeting future health care challenges.\n\nThe World Health Summit is presided over by Professor Dr med Detlev Ganten, a career medical research scientist and Chairman of the Board of the Charité Foundation. In addition to Professor Dr Ganten's role as standing President, each year the co-presidency rotates amongst the members of the M8 Alliance of Academic Health Centers, Universities and National Academies, which together with the European Union and the World Health Organization is a primary contributor to the World Health Summit's themes and programs.\n\nProfessor Dr João Gabriel Silva, Rector of the University of Coimbra, and Professor Dr Fernando Regateiro, Chairman of the Board of Directors of the Coimbra University Hospitals, will jointly act as International President for the tenth World Health Summit, to be held in Berlin October 14–16, 2018.\n\nPrevious co-presidencies have been exercised by:\n\nEach year the World Health Summit focuses on different key topics. These are formulated by members of the M8 Alliance and also by the eminent academicians, researchers and clinicians who form the World Health Summit Council.\n\nThe first World Health Summit under the motto \"The Evolution of Medicine\" took place October 14–18, 2009; 700 participants worked on concrete recommendations for dealing with pandemic planning, effective prevention strategies and climate change-related diseases.\n\nIn 2010, the World Health Summit was held October 10–13, focused on the continuum of: \"Translation – Transition – Transformation\"; in keeping with these topics, solutions facilitating the translation of medical knowledge into interventions that benefit patients across the globe, the new health challenges in a world of constant transition and the transformation of health politics and management to respond to these challenges were addressed.\n\nThe third World Health Summit took place October 23–26, 2011 under the motto: \"Today's Science – Tomorrow's Agenda\". The former element of this theme recognised that progress in research and technology development is occurring at an unsurpassed rate, while concurrently the challenges have never been greater, with new phenomena such as the health effects of climate change through the distribution of food and water, but also of vector-borne diseases. The latter reflected that no country has yet discovered an ideal health-service model, and that therefore the links between evidence and policy on all levels (national and international) needed to be strengthened.\n\nThe fourth World Health Summit, held from October 20–24, 2012, under the theme: “Research for Health and Sustainable Development\" focused on finding novel solutions for non-communicable diseases and conditions of global concern, such as obesity, diabetes, and mental illness. This recognised that unhealthy lifestyles are a main cause of these new epidemics, and promoted greater awareness of the global economic risks and human suffering related to the epidemiological transition, as well as the urgent need for sustainable solutions enabling healthcare systems to meet the challenge of non-communicable diseases and conditions.\n\nThe fifth World Health Summit, held from October 20–22, 2013, was the first Summit without individual theme. Instead, heightened emphasis was put on the four thematic tracks, structuring the program: Research and Innovation; Education and Leadership; Evidence to Policy; Global Health for Development. For the first time, the World Health Summit was held at the Federal Foreign Office in Berlin. 1,200 participants attended the Summit, additional 1,200 followed the official webcast.\n\nThe sixth World Health Summit, was held at the Federal Foreign Office in Berlin from October 19–22, 2014. Central topics were \"Climate Change and Health\", \"Universal Health Coverage\", \"Physical Activity for Health & Healthy Ageing\", and the current Ebola crisis. It attracted more than 1,200 registered participants from around 80 countries. Another 2,000 plus visitors from over 90 countries followed the plenary sessions digitally via live-stream on the Summit’s website and social media networks.\n\nAgain, the seventh World Health Summit was held at the Federal Foreign Office in Berlin from October 11–13, 2015. Central topics were refugee health, antimicrobial resistance, big data, and the effects of climate change on health. It attracted 1,500 registered participants from more than 90 countries. For the first time, the Startup Track offered young entrepreneurs the chance to present their ideas. mPharma from Ghana were elected as winner of this track.\n\nThe eighth World Health Summit was held from October 9–11, 2016, at the Federal Foreign Office in Berlin. Central topics included: Migration and Refugee Health; Big Data and Technological Innovation in Healthcare; Infectious Diseases and Lessons Learnt from Ebola to Zika; Women, Empowerment and Health. It attracted more than 1,600 international participants and ended with the publication of the M8 Alliance Declaration. The Startup Track 2016 was won by iFeel Labs from Israel.\n\nThe ninth World Health Summit was held from October 15-17 at Kosmos in Berlin-Friedrichshain. It brought together 2,000 participants from around 100 countries. Central topics included: Health Policy in the G7/G20, Vaccine Research and Development, Big Data for Health Governance, Global Health Security, Healthy and Resilient Cities, Creating Global Health Innovations with Africa, and the UN Sustainable Development Goals. The Startup Track 2017 was won by doctHERs from Pakistan.\n\nTraditionally, the co-presidency institution hosts the annual M8 Alliance planning meeting in its own home city in spring, preceding the event in October of that year. These meetings evolved into the inaugural World Health Summit Regional Meeting – Asia, held in Singapore from April 8–10, 2013. 900 participants attended this event, held under the theme \"Health for Sustainable Development in Asia\".\n\nThe second World Health Summit Regional Meeting – Latin America, was held in São Paulo from April 6–8, 2014, gathering 1,000 participants from 30 countries. Main topics were \"Healthy Life Expectancy\", \"Urban Health / Health in Megacities\", \"Increased Research Capacity to Incorporate Technologies\", \"Management of Health Systems to Ensure Universal Coverage\", and \"Health Education\".\n\nThe third World Health Summit Regional Meeting was held from April 13–14, 2015, in Kyoto, Japan. It was organized along three tracks: \"Challenges in a Rapidly Aging Society\"; \"Preparedness & Resilience to Disaster\"; \"Fostering the Next Generation of Global Health Leaders\". 600 participants attended this WHS Regional Meeting.\n\nThe World Health Summit Geneva Meeting was held from April 19–21, 2016. It was a cooperation of the Geneva Health Forum and the World Health Summit. The motto was “Global Health: Sustainable and Affordable Innovation in Healthcare”.\n\nIn 2017, the fifth WHS Regional Meeting was held in Montreal, Canada, under the Theme \"Health and Healthcare Delivery in Pluralistic Societies\". Central topics were: New Frontiers in Medical Treatment; Health and Healthcare Delivery for Specific Groups; Environmental, Social and Cultural Determinants of Health; and Medical Education for Optimal Healthcare.\n\n2018 will see the World Health Summit Regional Meeting be held in Portugal at the Convento de São Francisco, Coimbra. The conference will focus on four topics: \"Managing Infections Diseases in Developing Countries\"; \"Global Policies for Health Coverage in Low-Income Countries\"; \"Opportunities and Challenges in Translating Innovation to Healthcare\"; and \"Biomedical Education to a Changing World\". \n\nThe World Health Summit has been criticized by Thomas Gebauer, Director of Medico International, as an \"elitist club of decision makers\", that ignores both the social factor of global health issues and the notion of health as a human right, but rather serves particular interests. Thus, in 2009, this Frankfurt-based organization initiated an alternative conference as a form of protest against the World Health Summit.\n\nPermanent President of the World Health Summit, Professor Dr med Detlev Ganten, has consistently displayed a readiness to engage in constructive discussion with critics, inviting participants of the 2009 alternative conference to attend the World Health Summit 2010 and, thus to enter into a dialogue.\n\nThe M8 Alliance of Academic Health Centers, Universities and National Academies is an academic network of institutions of education and research, including national academies where these exist. It was first officially inaugurated in 2009 on occasion of the first World Health Summit. This international network provides the academic foundation to the World Health Summit.\n\nAccording to the M8 Alliance Profile, the network seeks to improve global health and works with political and economic decision makers and civil society to develop science-based solutions for health challenges worldwide. It was created as a permanent platform for framing future considerations of global medical developments and health challenges.\n\nA key role of the M8 Alliance is to provide an academic foundation to each World Health Summit, with members contributing to topics and program development.\n\nThe M8 Alliance consists of 25 members and affiliated observers spanning every continent. After the second World Health Summit in 2010, the University of São Paulo and the National University of Singapore joined the network, with the University of Montreal being welcomed into the group in 2012.
