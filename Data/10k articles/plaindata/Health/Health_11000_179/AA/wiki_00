Bowman claimed to cure all disease with herbs and a unique vegan diet based on various pseudoscience claims. His diet was based on the discredited alkaline diet. His beliefs on the origin of disease denied germ theory and taught that HIV is not the cause of AIDS, and factored in faux-afrocentric claims about the unique genetic characteristics of Africans and its diaspora.\n\nAlthough he used the name \"Dr.\" Sebi, Bowman was not a doctor and was considered a quack by actual doctors, attorneys, and consumer protection agencies.\n\nBowman was born in Ilanga, Honduras. He first learned of herbal healing from his grandmother. Bowman moved to the United States and, according to his literature, was dissatisfied with traditional medical practices in treating his asthma, diabetes, and impotency. After visits to Mexico to see an herbalist, whom Bowman claimed healed him, he began an herbal healing practice in New York.\n\nHe began another practice in Honduras he called the USHA Research Institute in a village called Usha near La Ceiba, Honduras. Bowman made vast amounts of money, more than $3000 a day, after giving advice to some notable celebrities including Lisa Lopes, Steven Seagal, John Travolta, Eddie Murphy and Michael Jackson. After the lawsuits in New York he relocated to Los Angeles, California.\nBowman was arrested for money laundering in March 2016 while attempting to transfer from a plane from the United States to a private plane at the Juan Manuel Gálvez de Roatan Airport while carrying $37,000 in cash. On 28 May 2016 he was arrested again carrying $50,000 and taken into custody. He was first released pending a court hearing on 6 June 2016, only to be re-arrested by the Public Ministerio on money laundering charges. He was held for several weeks in a Honduran prison as his family was attempting to obtain his release and subsequently died en route to Hospital D'Antoni on 6 August 2016 due to complications of pneumonia after police officials realized the severity of his health.\n\nThere is a conspiracy theory believed by some among his followers who question his arrest and death claiming that there was a conspiracy to silence him because his teachings differed from the medical establishment.\nBowman considered himself an African, not an \"African-Honduran\", but an African \"in\" Honduras.\n\nAt the time of his death, he had seventeen living children. His maternal grandfather was from Haiti.\nIn 1987, New York City charged him with a criminal charge of practicing medicine without a license. It was recognized that \"Dr. Sebi\" was not a physician, he was acquitted because jurors claimed the state failed to show he made a medical diagnosis. He was later sued by the New York Attorney General for consumer fraud and prevented from making therapeutic claims for his products. \n\nAt a 1993 Congressional hearing, Shirley Stark, who headed the NYAG's Consumer Fraud Section, indicated that a civil suit against Bowman's company had been successful, stating:\"\"A particularly glaring example of unsubstantiated therapeutic claims made for herbal supplements occurred a few years ago when the USHA Herbal Research Institute, run by a self-styled nutritionist calling himself \"Dr. Sebi,\" advertised in the Village Voice and the Amsterdam News that \"AIDS HAS BEEN CURED\" by USHA and that they also specialize in cures for Leukemia, sickle cell anemia, herpes, lupus and other diseases. For an initial fee of $500 and $80 for each additional visit, patients were told they could be cured of AIDS and other diseases. The \"cures\" consisted of various herbal products, for each of which USHA made therapeutic claims. Eva Therapeutic Salve, for example, was referred to in USHA's brochure as . . . \"very effective on major skin problems, in prenatal use, against poor circulation, cancer, cysts, hemorrhoids and arthritis.\" In fact, these claims were false. Our office filed suit against USHA and entered a consent agreement under which USHA can no longer make therapeutic claims for any of its products\"\"\n\nThe consent judgement prohibits the Ogun Herbal Research Institute (d/b/a \"USHA\"), Fig Tree Products Company, Alfredo Bowman, Maa Bowman, and their successors, heirs and assigns from (i) claiming that their products or services could cure, relieve or alter in any way the course of AIDS, herpes, leukemia, sickle cell anemia, lupus, or any other human disease or physical condition, (ii) distributing or advertising such products, and (iii) diagnosing, treating or prescribing for any human disease without a valid state license by the New York State Education Department. A sum of $900 for costs was assessed to the defendants.\n\nIn 2004, Bowman claims that he was not paid in full for an alleged treatment for Michael Jackson to help him overcome painkiller addiction to Demerol and morphine with his \"African Bio-Electric Cell Food Therapy,\" which apparently lasted six months at an Aspen retreat providing him with \"special herb compounds\" and trained cooks. Bowman claims that $380,000 was outstanding and sought $600,000 in lost revenue of the deferment of clients and various speaking arrangements after Jackson's brother Randy only gave him $10,000. Raymone Bain, a publicist of Jackson acknowledges that Bowman was a friend of Jackson but denies that his client received any \"professional treatment\" or that he had any painkiller addiction. The case was dismissed in 2015 for lack of prosecution.\n\n"}

It is in the Summer Lake watershed. The site has been the focus of Oregon Department of Environmental Quality (DEQ) efforts to remediate a complex mix of toxic chemicals. Problems were initially caused by the dumping of hazardous waste near the lakebed between 1969 and 1971.\n\nBeginning in February 1969, Chemical Waste Storage and Disposition, a Beaverton company, stored roughly 25,000 55-gallon drums of chemical waste near the shore of the playa with a permit from the Oregon Department of Agriculture. The drums contained pesticides including 2,4-D and MCPA herbicide residue containing chlorophenols, polymeric chlorophenoxyphenols and dioxins/furans (including 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin); metallic chloride waste, and paints and paint solvent. Chemical Waste Storage was contracted for waste disposal by the Chipman division of Rhodia, a Portland herbicide manufacturer, and by Oregon Metallurgical Corporation, a titanium producer. Further shipments were prohibited in 1971, due to improper waste handling practices. The State of Oregon took over the site in 1974, after losing legal actions against Chemical Waste Storage to force their compliance with new hazardous waste laws. First the Circuit Court and then the Court of Appeals determined that the company was financially unable to comply with the new regulations and that the State was to some extent complicit. In 1976, at a cost of $84,000, the state used bulldozers to push, crush and compact the leaking barrels into a dozen shallow, unlined, 400' long trenches, then covered them with soil.\n\nThis trench method was the least expensive option presented to the DEQ, and was chosen against scientific advisors' advice and protest. The United States Environmental Protection Agency's regional administrator over the area also opposed the trench remediation. The state released Chemical Waste Storage's owners from any liability in 1976.\n\nAccording to the DEQ's 2007 factsheet, water testing results had revealed a subsurface plume extending about 2000' to the north-northwest of the dumpsite and covering at least has contaminated the shallow groundwater aquifer at the site, but according to the DEQ, it has not expanded since their assessment of the area began in 1991. The area is polluted with dioxins: the soil contains up to 100 parts per trillion, and nearby groundwater is about 0.4 parts per trillion. A fence was installed to prevent grazing cattle from entering the area. The endangered Hutton Springs tui chub are only known to live at Hutton Spring, away. According to the United States Fish and Wildlife Service, \"The DEQ has determined that the contaminated plume is spreading from east to west, away from Hutton Spring and thus does not currently constitute a threat to the water quality in Hutton Spring\". Threatened western snowy plovers have also been observed at the lake, feeding on brine shrimp. A low-temperature methanogen extremophile, \"Methanohalophilus oregonense\", was found at the dump site in 1989 by David Boone, an Oregon Graduate Institute scientist.\n\nThe dumpsite is currently surrounded by barbed wire and owned by Bayer CropScience, the successor to Rhodia. The trenches were recovered with a soil cap in 1993. The dumpsite is and contains 50 monitoring wells. There are an estimated 800,000 to 1.4 million gallons of toxic waste at the site, and is called one of Oregon's worst toxic-waste dumps by the project manager at the DEQ. Oregon has paid over $2 million for monitoring and to acquire land surrounding the dump. While the state of Oregon allocated a special fund for abandoned waste sites in 1991, it specifically does not cover the Alkali Lake site, which comes from the regular budget for DEQ.\n\n"}

{"id": "3237319", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=3237319", "title": "Auditory verbal agnosia", "text": "Auditory verbal agnosia\n\nAuditory verbal agnosia (AVA), also known as pure word deafness, is the inability to comprehend speech. Individuals with this disorder lose the ability to understand language, repeat words, and write from dictation. Some patients with AVA describe hearing spoken language as meaningless noise, often as though the person speaking was doing so in a foreign language. However, spontaneous speaking, reading, and writing are preserved. The maintenance of the ability to process non-speech auditory information, including music, also remains relatively more intact than spoken language comprehension. Individuals who exhibit pure word deafness are also still able to recognize non-verbal sounds. The ability to interpret language via lip reading, hand gestures, and context clues is preserved as well. Sometimes, this agnosia is preceded by cortical deafness; however, this is not always the case. Researchers have documented that in most patients exhibiting auditory verbal agnosia, the discrimination of consonants is more difficult than that of vowels, but as with most neurological disorders, there is variation among patients.\n\nAuditory verbal agnosia (AVA) is not the same as auditory agnosia; patients with (nonverbal) auditory agnosia have a relatively more intact speech comprehension system despite their impaired recognition of nonspeech sounds.\n\nAuditory verbal agnosia can be referred to as a pure aphasia because it has a high degree of specificity. Despite an inability to comprehend speech, patients with auditory verbal agnosia typically retain the ability to hear and process non-speech auditory information, speak, read and write. This specificity suggests that there is a separation between speech perception, non-speech auditory processing, and central language processing. In support of this theory, there are cases in which speech and non-speech processing impairments have responded differentially to treatment. For example, some therapies have improved writing comprehension in patients over time, while speech remained critically impaired in those same patients.\n\nThe term \"pure word deafness\" is something of a misnomer. By definition, individuals with pure word deafness are not deaf – in the absence of other impairments, these individuals have normal hearing for all sounds, including speech. The term \"deafness\" originates from the fact that individuals with AVA are unable to \"comprehend\" speech that they hear. The term \"pure word\" refers to the fact that comprehension of verbal information is selectively impaired in AVA. For this reason, AVA is distinct from other auditory agnosias in which the recognition of nonspeech sounds is impaired. Classical (or pure) auditory agnosia is an inability to process environmental sounds. Interpretive or receptive agnosia (amusia) is an inability to understand music.\n\nPatients with pure word deafness complain that speech sounds simply do not register, or that they tend not to come up. Other claims include speech sounding as if it were in a foreign language, the words having a tendency to run together, or the feeling that speech was simply not connected to the patient's voice.\nAuditory verbal agnosia has been shown to form as a result of tumor formation, especially in the posterior third ventricle, trauma, lesions, cerebral infarction, encephalitis as a result of herpes simplex, and Landaui-Kleffner syndrome. The exact location of damage which results in pure word deafness is still under debate, but the planum temporale, posterior STG, and white matter damage to the acoustic radiations (AR) have all been implicated.\n\nAuditory verbal agnosia is rarely diagnosed in its pure form. Auditory verbal agnosia can both present as the result of acute damage or as chronic, progressive degeneration over time. Cases have been documented that result from severe acute head trauma resulting in bilateral temporal lobe damage. In contrast, auditory verbal agnosia has also been documented to present progressively over several years. In one such case, the patient exhibited progressive word deafness over a 9-year period but did not exhibit any other cognitive of mental deterioration. MRIs showed cortical atrophy in the left superior temporal lobe region.\n\nIn childhood, auditory verbal agnosia can also be caused by Landau-Kleffner syndrome, also called acquired epileptic aphasia. It is often the first symptom of this disease. A review of 45 cases suggested a relationship between prognosis and age of onset with poorer prognosis for those with earlier onset. In extremely rare cases, auditory verbal agnosia has been known to present as a symptom of neurodegenerative disease, such as Alzheimer's disease. In such cases auditory verbal agnosia is a symptom that is typically followed by more severe neurological symptoms typical of Alzheimer's disease.\n\nThere is no uniform performance among patients with auditory verbal agnosia; therefore it is not possible to attribute specific phonetic or phonological deficits to the syndrome. In order to diagnose AVA, two intact abilities need to be established:\nIf both of these criteria are met \"and\" lack of auditory verbal comprehension is apparent, a diagnosis of AVA may follow.\n\nIn at least one instance, the Boston Diagnostic Aphasia Examination has been used to profile AVA. This method was able to show that the patient experienced marked difficulty in speech perception with minor to no minor deficits in production, reading, and writing, fitting the profile of AVA. While this provides a well-known example, other verbal-audio test batteries can and have also been used to diagnose pure speech deafness.\n\nAuditory verbal agnosia is the inability to distinguish phonemes. In some patients with unilateral auditory verbal agnosia, there is evidence that the ability to acoustically process speech signals is affected at the prephonemic level, preventing the conversion of these signals into phonemes. There are two predominate hypotheses that address what happens within the language center of the brain in people that have AVA. One of the hypotheses is that an early stage of auditory analysis is impaired. The fact that AVA patients have the ability to read shows that both the semantic system and the speech output lexicon are intact. The second hypotheses suggests that there is either a complete or partial disconnection of the auditory input lexicon from the semantic system. This would suggest that entries in the lexicon can still be activated but they cannot go on to cause subsequent semantic activation. In relation to these two different hypotheses, researchers in one study differentiated between two different types of AVA. According to this study, one form of AVA is a deficit at the prephonemic level and is related to the inability to comprehend rapid changes in sound.This form of AVA is associated with bilateral temporal lobe lesions. Speech perception in patients with this form of AVA has been shown to improve significantly in understanding when the pace of speech is drastically slowed. The second type of AVA that the study discusses is a deficit in linguistic discrimination that does not adhere to a prephonemic pattern. This form is associated with left unilateral temporal lobe lesions and may even be considered a form of Wernicke's aphasia. Often individuals diagnosed with auditory verbal agnosia are also incapable of discriminating between non-verbal sounds as well as speech. The underlying problem seems to be temporal in that understanding speech requires the discrimination between specific sounds which are closely spaced in time. Note that this is not unique to speech; studies using non-speech sounds closely spaced in time (dog bark, phone ring, lightning, etc.) have shown that those with auditory verbal agnosia are unable to discriminate between those sounds in the majority of cases, though a few putative examples of speech-specific impairment have been documented in the literature.\n\nAuditory verbal agnosia is caused by bilateral damage, often in the form of cerebrovascular accidents which form as a result of an embolism, to the posterior superior temporal lobes or disruption of connections between these areas. A unilateral lesion in the left or right superior temporal lobe can also result in pure word deafness, this being much more common in the left hemisphere than the right. It is often associated with lesions to the left posterior superior temporal lobe, but no such unilateral case has yet been documented without damage to the white matter tract connecting superior temporal lobes bilaterally or bilateral damage to the superior temporal lobe. In cases where unilateral damage to the left superior temporal lobe has been documented, patients exhibited problems processing both speech and non-speech sounds (in other words, not typical of auditory verbal agnosia). These facts, in combination with the existence of cases of damage to these white matter tracts without detectable cortical damage, in combination with cases of pure word deafness resulting enlargement of the third ventricle alone suggest that the disorder results from damage to the left-right superior temporal circuit rather than the superior temporal area on one hemisphere or the other.\n\nMany of the bilateral cases share one essential feature: after the first (unilateral) lesion, speech perception was typically intact after an initial period of disturbance. Only after the second lesion (in the other hemisphere) were permanent speech perception problems the consistent outcome. The fact that most of these patients only manifested auditory verbal agnosia subsequent to the second lesion supports the hypothesis that both sides of the superior temporal gyrus are necessary.\n\nAuditory verbal agnosia is rarely diagnosed in its pure form. Auditory verbal agnosia can present as the result of acute damage or chronic, progressive degeneration over time. Cases have been documented that result from severe acute head trauma resulting in bilateral temporal lobe damage. In contrast, auditory verbal agnosia has also been documented to present progressively over several years. In one such case, the patient exhibited progressive word deafness over a 9-year period but did not exhibit any other cognitive of mental deterioration. This patient was found, using MRIs, to have cortical atrophy in the left superior temporal lobe region.\n\nSign language therapy has been identified as one of the top five most common treatments for auditory verbal agnosia. This type of therapy is most useful because, unlike other treatment methods, it does not rely on fixing the damaged areas of the brain. This is particularly important with AVA cases because it has been so hard to identify the causes of the agnosia in the first place, much less treat those areas directly. Sign language therapy, then, allows the person to cope and work around the disability, much in the same way it helps deaf people. In the beginning of therapy, most will work on identifying key objects and establishing an initial core vocabulary of signs. After this, the patient graduates to expand the vocabulary to intangible items or items that are not in view or present. Later, the patient learns single signs and then sentences consisting of two or more signs. In different cases, the sentences are first written down and then the patient is asked to sign them and speak them simultaneously. Because different AVA patients vary in the level of speech or comprehension they have, sign language therapy learning order and techniques are very specific to the individual's needs.\n\nIn incidents where tumors and their pressure effects are the cause of pure word deafness, removal of the tumor has been shown to allow for the return of most auditory verbal comprehension.\n\nTreating auditory verbal agnosia with intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) is controversial because of its inconsistency as a treatment method. Although IVIG is normally used to treat immune diseases, some individuals with auditory verbal agnosia have responded positively to the use of IVIG. Additionally, patients are more likely to relapse when treated with IVIG than other pharmacological treatments. IVIG is, thus, a controversial treatment as its efficacy in treating auditory verbal agnosia is dependent upon each individual and varies from case to case.\n\nIn a study conducted by Masaaki Nagafuchi et al. (1993), a 7-year-old girl began taking a dose of 2 mg diazepam orally every day. She demonstrated major improvements in behavior and comprehension of speech while under diazepam therapy. Within a month, conversation problems were eliminated. After a year of therapy, her repetition ability was almost normal. After two years, her ability to discriminate monosyllabic words was within the normal range. Her audiological recognition had remained normal from the time of onset (i.e., she could recognize familiar noises such as a baby crying or a telephone ringing).\n\n"}

The word \"bayakou\" comes from Haitian Creole. \"Bayakou\" are subjected to social stigma for their work in manually emptying septic tanks and pit latrines. \n\nThe more general term used for this kind of undignified practice, particularly in India, is \"manual scavenging\". Proper emptying of pit latrines is part of a city-wide fecal sludge management concept.\n\nPort-au-Prince is one of the largest cities in the world without a sewer system. Sinks, showers and toilets have no connection to a central sewage treatment plant. Most of the city uses septic tanks and pit latrines. Port-au-Prince finally opened its first sewage treatment plant, Morne a Cabrit, in 2012 with a second, unfinished plant mostly abandoned. \n\nBecause of the lack of infrastructure for sewage removal, the city turns to other means. The \"bayakou\" in Port-au-Prince are paid to come annually to empty the pits of full pit latrines.\n\n\"Bayakou\" use plastic buckets to empty pit latrines during the night. The bayakou work as a crew. One part of the bayakou team climbs through the toilet's squat hole into the pit under the latrine and fills the bucket. Then the person in the pit hands the bucket up to another crew-member. The human waste is put into sacks and placed into a wheelbarrow which a third person carts away. The waste is normally dumped on the ground, ravines or sometimes into vacuum trucks run by private companies who will take the waste to the treatment plant. Dumping waste anywhere other than in a treatment plant is illegal. Some bayakou have been arrested for transporting waste. \n\nBefore entering the pit, \"bayakou\" pour floor cleaner into the pit in order to soften the fecal sludge. Many \"bayakou\" clean the pit in the nude because the filth in the latrines will ruin their clothes and protective gear. Hazards of the job include injury from objects thrown into latrines and exposure to infectious diseases such as cholera. \n\n\"Bayakou\" and their families also face social stigma for working with human waste.\n\n"}

The culture of chillum-smoking has spread from India to the rest of the world since the mid-1960s.\n\nWhen smoking a chillum a chillum stone is often inserted in the pipe to keep from directly inhaling debris much like a screen or filter is used in other pipes. They are generally tight fitting, conical with a flat top and usually have a small hole drilled down through the centre and slits down the sides to allow smoke to pass freely. Before they were commercially available people would search for the right sized pebble off the ground to fit their pipes. Some still do.\n\nAccording to Alfred Dunhill, Africans have long employed chillum-style pipes for smoking cannabis and later tobacco. Gourds and various horns were often employed while conical bowls were common in Uganda. One of the more famous pipes is an ivory cone pipe once belonging to \"Waganda\" monarch King Mtesa.\n\nMore recently, it has also seen use in sacraments by Rastafari.\n\nSince the 1960s the embellished bamboo chillum has become an American folk art form. These pipes are handmade and often sold by the artists on street corners in places like the Haight-Ashbury district of San Francisco and the Greenwich Village area of New York City. As designs these contemporary smoking pipes recall traditional decorated bamboo pipes from Borneo, however, the American carved bamboo design often employs a brass lighting fixture for a bowl. Since the 1970s, street artist Darrel \"Pipeman\" Mortimer of San Francisco has made nearly 10,000 such pipes, each signed, numbered, and sold personally.\n\nIn \"reasoning sessions\" and grounations, the ritual chillum used is made of a cow's horn or conical wood piece, fitted with a long drawtube giving the smoke time to cool before inhalation. \n\nA bong-like chillum equipped with a water filtration chamber is sometimes referred to as a chalice, based on a quote from the Biblical book of Deuteronomy. Thanks and praises are offered to Jah before smoking the chillum.\n\n"}

It is used to standardize the comparison of drug usage between different drugs or between different health care environments. The DDD is not to be confused with the therapeutic dose or with the dose actually prescribed by a physician for an individual patient.\n\nThe WHO's definition is: \"The DDD is the assumed average maintenance dose per day for a drug used for its main indication in adults.\"\n\nA common problem when comparing drugs is that different medications can be of different potency. For example, 20 mg of the beta blocker propranolol are much less effective than 20 mg of the beta blocker bisoprolol. To reflect this, the WHO has decided on a DDD for propranolol of 160 mg and for bisoprolol of 10 mg. Individual patients can still be prescribed higher or lower doses, for instance in children, patients with liver or kidney impairment, patients with a combination therapy, or due to differences in drug metabolism between individuals or ethnicities (genetic polymorphism).\n\nThe DDD system is most frequently used in academic articles and reports, and as a tool for comparison and control over nationwide total drug consumption. For example, the overall drug consumption of beta blockers can be measured in DDDs and compared between different countries, sexes or other populations.\n\nIf the DDD for a certain drug is given, the number of DDDs used by an individual patient or (more commonly) by a collective of patients is as follows.\n\nformula_1\n\nFor example, the analgesic (pain reliever) paracetamol has a DDD of 3 g, which means that an average patient who takes paracetamol for its main indication, which is pain relief, uses 3 grams per day. This is equivalent to six standard tablets of 500 mg each. If a patient consumes 24 such tablets (12 g of paracetamol in total) over a certain span of time, this equals a consumption of four DDDs.\n\nformula_2\n\n\n"}

Any response, whether it is appropriate or not, would showcase the presence of this phenomenon. Although emotional responsivity is a general term that is applied to nonclinical populations, it has also been associated with individuals with schizophrenia and autism.\n\nEmotional responsivity is said to have a unique association with social interaction. Studies suggest that social interaction, especially at home, can influence the way a child responds to emotional stimuli. For example, if child grew up in a home where emotional displays resulted in punishment or negative criticism, the child would have the tendency to find ways to hide their emotions.\n\nIn experimental studies, emotional responsivity can be measured through various tasks, which would allow participants' facial expressions and behavior to be recorded and sometimes coded. Tasks used to measure emotional responsivity, particularly in children, include:\n\nEmotional responsivity can also be examined through psycho-physiological approaches such as:\n\nSleeping issues in children have been linked to many physical and mental health problems later on in adulthood and created a greater risk for emotional and behavioral issues in children. Studies haven't been able to link the physiological functions with sleeping disturbances to these psychological consequences. Emotional liability, responsivity, psychological responses to positive and negative picture stimuli have all been a result of sleep deprivation. \n\nDoctors today are using neuroimaging to connect the relationship between sleep and neural mechanisms that cause emotional responsively in children. There studies resulted, \"In general, the largest and most extensive sleep-related correlations for any emotion were found for disgust expressions\" . \n\nThere was a study done involving twenty six children with autism and fifteen children with other learning disabilities, in which an adult displayed some form of emotion to study how the children respond. They focused on attention, hedonic tone, latency to changes in tone and a emotional contagion summery was made. Studies showed correlations between measures of joint attention, emotional contagion, and the severity of autism. Results showed that children with autism did not demonstrate changes in affect, however their responses occurred much less than in comparison groups. \n"}

Chemically, it is the sodium salt of 4-carboxystyryl-4-chlorobenzylsulfone.\n\nThe results of two Phase I clinical studies in healthy human volunteers indicate that subcutaneously injected Ex-Rad is safe and well tolerated, with \"no evidence of systemic side effects\".

The study tested oral and parenteral administration of Ex-Rad for both pre- and post-exposure radiomitigation.\n\nResearch on Ex-Rad has involved collaboration with the Armed Forces Radiobiology Research Institute (AFRRI), the Department of Biochemistry and Molecular & Cellular Biology at Georgetown University, Long Island University's Arnold & Marie Schwartz College of Pharmacy, and the Department of Oncological Sciences at the Mt.

Ex-RAD is a chlorobenzylsulfone derivative that works after free radicals have damaged DNA. Onconova CEO Ramesh Kumar believes this is a better approach than trying to scavenge free radicals. “Free radicals are very short-lived, and so the window of opportunity to give a drug is very narrow,” he says. In cell and animal models, Ex-RAD protects hematopoietic and gastrointestinal tissues from radiation injury when given either before or after exposure.\n\n\n"}

The process was overseen by the Institute of Grocery Distribution (IGD). To help consumers make sense of the nutrition information provided on food labels, they translate science into consumer friendly information, providing guidelines on pack that help consumers put the nutrition information they read on a food label into the context of their overall diet.\n\nGDAs are guidelines for healthy adults and children about the approximate amount of calories, fat, saturated fat, total sugars, and sodium/salt. The GDA labels have the percentage of daily value per serving and the absolute amount per serving of these categories. The front-of-packages (FOP) GDAs must at least have calories listed, but the back-of-package (BOP) GDAs must list, at a minimum, these five.\n\nA modified version of the GDA system was adopted by the Australian food and beverage industry in 2006 and called the 'Daily Intake Guide'. In 2009 the original GDA system analysis as adopted as an industry standard in the European Union and in 2012 a variant was adopted in the US and called 'Facts Up Front'.\n\nSince introduction into the world outside the UK there has been controversy on what the GDAs actually show, for example, calculating a personal R.I., which is dependent on a person's height, weight, amount of daily activity and age, an intake rating which is about 5-10% above what that person should actually be eating and drinking. When calculating the GDAs the CIAA uses the average caloric intake needed for women because this best fits the needs of the majority of the population. Women need, on average, between 1800–2200 kilocalories (kcal) a day whereas children need between 1500–2000 kcal and men 2200–2700 kcal. In March 2009, the European Food Safety Authority published its opinion on intake levels for Europe and they were consistent with numbers behind the GDAs developed in the UK.\n\nMoreover, not all categories are equal. While a GDA for calorific intake might represent a broad target in so far as people need to take in a minimum of calories to survive, the GDA for saturated fat is not a target, as ingesting no saturated fats at all would not be harmful to health, so long as there were fats of a non-saturated variety in the diet.\n\nGDAs are now in widespread use across the food industry and appear both on the front and back of food packaging.\n\nIn 2014, GDAs were beginning to be replaced by reference intakes.\n\n\n"}

Laughlin\n\nHarry Hamilton Laughlin (March 11, 1880 – January 26, 1943) was an American educator, eugenicist, and sociologist. He served as the Superintendent of the Eugenics Record Office from its inception in 1910 to its closing in 1939, and was among the most active individuals in influencing American eugenics policy, especially compulsory sterilization legislation.\n\nHarry Hamilton Laughlin was born March 11, 1880 in Oskaloosa, Iowa. He graduated from the First District Normal School (now Truman State University) in Kirksville, Missouri. In 1917, he earned a Doctor of Science from Princeton University in the field of cytology.\n\nHe worked as a high school teacher and principal before his interest turned to eugenics. This led to his correspondence with Charles Davenport, an early researcher into Mendelian inheritance in the United States. In 1910, Davenport asked Laughlin to move to Long Island, New York, to serve as the superintendent of his new research office.\n\nThe Eugenics Record Office (ERO) was founded at Cold Spring Harbor, New York, by Davenport with initial support from Mary Williamson Averell (Mrs. E. H. Harriman) and John Harvey Kellogg, and later by the Carnegie Institution of Washington. Laughlin was made the managing director and was zealous in pursuing the goals of the institution, even co-writing a \"eugenical comedy in four acts\" for performance at the ERO for the amusement of the field workers being trained. He regularly lectured to various groups around the country.\n\nLaughlin provided extensive statistical testimony to the United States Congress in support of the Johnson-Reed Immigration Act of 1924. Part of his testimony dealt with \"excessive\" insanity among immigrants from southern Europe and eastern Europe. He was eventually appointed as an \"expert eugenics agent\" to the Committee on Immigration and Naturalization (the 1924 law applied national-origin quotas on immigrants, which stopped the large Italian and Russian influx of the early 1900s). At least one contemporary scientist, bacterial geneticist Herbert Spencer Jennings, condemned Laughlin's statistics as invalid because they compared recent immigrants to more settled immigrants.\n\nIn 1927, the Eugenics Research Association, of which Laughlin was an officer, began a study of the heritage of U.S. Senators. Some senators were enthusiastic, others reluctantly complied, while Senator William Cabell Bruce questioned whether eugenics was even a science and refused to participate. Laughlin wrote to Bruce's hometown newspaper in an attempt to get the information.\n\nOne of Laughlin's key interests was to aid in the proliferation of compulsory sterilization legislation in the United States, which would presumably sterilize the \"unfit\" members of the population. By 1914, twelve states had already passed sterilization laws, beginning with Indiana in 1907 and Connecticut in 1909. However, the laws were not employed with significant vigor, with the exception of California. In his study of this \"problem,\" Laughlin deduced that much of the state sterilization legislation was poorly worded and left it open to questions of constitutionality and confusion over bureaucratic responsibility. As a result, Laughlin drafted the \"Model Eugenical Sterilization Law\", a model act for compulsory sterilization, intended to satisfy these difficulties. He published the proposal in his 1922 study of American sterilization policy, \"Eugenical Sterilization in the United States.\" It included as subjects for eugenic sterilization: the feeble-minded, the insane, criminals, epileptics, alcoholics, blind persons, deaf persons, deformed persons, and indigent persons. An additional eighteen states passed laws based on Laughlin's model, including Virginia in 1924.\n\nThe first person ordered sterilized in Virginia under the new law was Carrie Buck, on the grounds that she was the \"probable potential parent of socially inadequate offspring.\" A lawsuit ensued and Laughlin, who had never met Buck, gave a deposition endorsing her suitability for sterilization, calling the family members of \"\"the shiftless, ignorant, and worthless class of anti-social whites of the South\".\" Other scientists from the ERO testified in person. The state won the case, which was appealed to the United States Supreme Court in 1927. The resulting case, \"Buck v. Bell,\" upheld the constitutionality of the laws that Laughlin helped write. Five months after the court confirmed the law, Carrie Buck was sterilized. A law allowing for the sterilization of repeat criminals was overturned in 1942, in \"Skinner v. Oklahoma,\" but sterilizations of mental patients continued into the 1970s. Altogether more than 60,000 Americans were sterilized. Virginia repealed its sterilization law in 1974. Laughlin also supported the passage of Virginia's Racial Integrity Act, which outlawed miscegenation. In 1967, the U.S. Supreme Court overturned that law in \"Loving v. Virginia.\"\n\nThe Reichstag of Nazi Germany passed the Law for the Prevention of Hereditarily Diseased Offspring in 1933, closely based on Laughlin's model. Between 35,000 and 80,000 persons were sterilized in the first full year alone. (It is now known that over 350,000 persons were sterilized). Laughlin was awarded an honorary degree by the University of Heidelberg in 1936 for his work behalf of the \"science of racial cleansing.\" (Five other Americans received honorary degrees the same year). However, reports about the extensive use of compulsory sterilization in Germany began to appear in US newspapers. By the end of the decade, eugenics had become associated with Nazism and poor science. Support for groups like the American Eugenics Society began to fade. In 1935, a review panel convened by the Carnegie Institute concluded that the ERO's research did not have scientific merit. By 1939, the Institute withdrew funding for the ERO, and the office was forced to close.\n\nLaughlin was a founding member of the Pioneer Fund, and was its first president, serving from 1937 to 1941. The Pioneer Fund was created by Wickliffe Draper in order to promote the \"betterment of the race\" through eugenics. Draper had been supporting the Eugenics Research Association and its \"Eugenical News\" since 1932. One of the first projects that Laughlin pursued for the Fund was the distribution of two films from Germany depicting the success of eugenic programs in that country. A biographer has described Laughlin as \"among the most racist and anti-Semitic of early twentieth-century eugenicists.\"\n\nAs well as his interest in eugenics, Laughlin was fascinated by the idea of establishing a world government. He worked on his plans for this institution throughout his adult life. The world government model that he devised was loosely based on the U.S. Constitution and the League of Nations. The allotment of representation in the body was heavily biased in favor of Europe and North America, particularly Great Britain and the United States. Laughlin believed that his world government model would promote the eugenicist aim of preventing the intermixing of different races. Many leading internationalists expressed interest in Laughlin's world government plan, including Edward M. House, Woodrow Wilson's foreign policy adviser.\n\nHe was married to Pansy Laughlin in 1902, and they did not have children. They resided in Missouri in retirement. After his retirement from the Eugenics Record Office they returned to Kirksville in December 1939. Dr. Laughlin died January 26, 1943, and was buried near his father and mother in Highland Park Cemetery in Kirksville.\n\nHe died on January 26, 1943 in Missouri and is buried in Highland Park Cemetery in Kirksville, Missouri.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "16187327", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=16187327", "title": "Healthcare in Singapore", "text": "Healthcare in Singapore\n\nHealthcare in Singapore is supervised by the Ministry of Health of the Singapore Government. It largely consists of a government-run universal healthcare system with a significant private healthcare sector. In addition, financing of healthcare costs is done through a mixture of direct government subsidies, compulsory savings, national healthcare insurance, and cost sharing.\n\nSingapore generally has an efficient and widespread system of healthcare. Singapore was ranked 6th in the World Health Organization's ranking of the world's health systems in the year 2000. Bloomberg ranked Singapore’s healthcare system the most efficient in the world in 2014. The Economist Intelligence Unit placed Singapore 2nd out of 166 countries for health-care outcomes.\n\nAccording to global consulting firm Towers Watson, Singapore has \"one of the most successful healthcare systems in the world, in terms of both efficiency in financing and the results achieved in community health outcomes\". This has been attributed to a combination of a strong reliance on medical savings accounts, cost sharing, and government regulation. The government regularly adjusts policies to actively regulate \"the supply and prices of healthcare services in the country\" in an attempt to keep costs in check. However, for the most part the government does not directly regulate the costs of private medical care. These costs are largely subject to market forces, and vary enormously within the private sector, depending on the medical specialty and service provided. However, Towers Watson has claimed that the specific features of the Singapore healthcare system are unique, and have been described as a \"very difficult system to replicate in many other countries.\" Many Singaporeans also have supplemental private health insurance (often provided by employers) for services not covered by the government's programmes.\n\nSince the 1990s, all public hospitals, polyclinics, and specialty centres have been restructured as government-owned corporations, and operate under three healthcare groups or \"clusters\":\n\nThe 8 public hospitals comprise 6 acute general hospitals (SGH, NUH, CGH, TTSH, KTPH & NTFGH), a women's and children's hospital (KKH) and a psychiatry hospital (IMH). In addition, there are 8 national specialty centres for cancer (NCCS), cardiac (NHCS), eye (SNEC), skin (NSC), neuroscience (NNI), dental care (NDCS) and a medical centre for multiple disciplines (NCIS and NHCS).\n\nAs of 2012, Singapore had a total of 10,225 doctors in its healthcare system, giving a doctor to population ratio of 1:520. The nurse (including midwives) to population ratio was 1:150, with a total of 34,507 nurses. There were 1,645 dentists, giving a ratio of 1 dentist to 3,230 people.\n\nApproximately 70–80% of Singaporeans obtain their medical care within the public health system. Overall government spending on public healthcare amounts to 1.6% of annual GDP. This amounted to an average of $1,104 Government Health Expenditure per person. Health-related spending is the third largest expenditure item, after defence and education expenses. As the median age of the population increases, Singapore's healthcare spending is expected to rise. Healthcare spending has risen from $4 billion in 2011 to $9.8 billion in 2016.\n\nSingapore's healthcare system uses a mixed financing system that includes nationalised life insurance schemes and deductions from the compulsory savings plan, or the Central Provident Fund (CPF), for working Singaporeans and permanent residents. This mechanism is intended to reduce the overuse of healthcare services.\n\nMedisave is a medical savings account under an individual's CPF account that is used for payment of future medical expenses as well as premiums of medical insurance policies. Funds can be pooled within and across an entire extended family\n\nLaunched in 1990, Medishield is a low cost basic insurance scheme intended for those whose savings are insufficient to meet their medical expenses. Premiums can be paid out of Medisave accounts. A new scheme, Medishield Life, replaced the Medishield in November 2015. Co-insurance payment rates are to be reduced from 10–20% to 3–10% and the lifetime claim limit is to be removed. The scheme helps to pay for hospital bills and selected outpatient treatments. The government provides premium subsidies to lower- to middle-income residents, the elderly and new policyholders transitioning from cheaper policies.\n\nThe Integrated Shield Plan (IP) includes both the MediShield Life component and an additional private insurance coverage component run by private insurers, to cover for optional benefits in public hospitals and private hospitals. Premiums for the IP can be paid by the Medisave funds.\n\nEldershield is a severe disability insurance scheme which insures against the cost of private nursing homes and related expenses. Since 2002, members with a CPF Medisave account will automatically be enrolled in the scheme at the age of 40, unless they choose to opt out. Three private insurers, Aviva, Great Eastern and NTUC Income were chosen to manage ElderShield. It has 1.2 million policyholders as of 2015, with $2.6 billion collected in premiums, and around $100 million in payout claims and $130 million in premium rebates between 2002 and 2015.\n\nIn addition to the insurance schemes, Medifund is government endowment fund for those who are unable to meet their assessed contribution. Risks are not pooled, so an individual may be exposed to catastrophic expenses. A total of $155.2 million was allocated to patients in 2015.\n\nSingapore citizens and Permanent Residents warded in public hospitals receive government subsidies for their medical fees, which scale according to their chosen class of ward as well as their income. Since 1 January 2009, patients warded in B2 and C class wards in public hospitals undergo means testing to determine the level of subsidy they are entitled to, based on the average monthly income received over the last available 12-month period including bonuses for salaried employees. However, patients receiving services such as Day Surgery, A&E services, Specialist Outpatient and polyclinic visits receive standardised subsidies regardless of income without requiring means testing.\n\nPeople with no income, such as retirees or housewives, will have their subsidy rate pegged to the value of their homes, whereas all unemployed residents of HDB flats excluding those in executive condominiums (EC) will be entitled to the highest tier of subsidy.\n\nAs follows is a table detailing the subsidies available:\nThe increasingly large private sector provides care to those who are privately insured, foreign patients, or public patients who are able to afford what often amounts to very large out-of-pocket payments above the levels provided by government subsidies.\n\nThe government uses the capacity of the private sector to reduce waiting times in the public sector. In 2015 it plans to use the Raffles Medical Group to receive non-critical ambulance cases.\n\nIn October 2003, acting Minister for Health Khaw Boon Wan launched SingaporeMedicine to promote Singapore as a regional medical hub. He said more than 200,000 foreigners visited Singapore for medical services in 2002 and that the Economic Review Committee reaffirmed its ambition of serving 1 million foreign patients annually by 2012. In his speech, Khaw said,\n\"SingaporeMedicine that we are launching today shall be the rallying point and a powerful symbol of our collective will and commitment towards this ambition...\n\nIn three specialties alone, heart, eye and cancer, I see tens of millions of middle-class patients within a 7-hour flying radius, waiting to be served.

Patients were asked to tally a list of 43 life events based on a relative score. A positive correlation of 0.118 was found between their life events and their illnesses.\n\nTheir results were published as the Social Readjustment Rating Scale (SRRS), known more commonly as the Holmes and Rahe Stress Scale. Subsequent validation has supported the links between stress and illness.\n\nRahe carried out a study in 1970 testing the validity of the stress scale as a predictor of illness. The scale was given to 2,500 US sailors and they were asked to rate scores of 'life events' over the previous six months. Over the next six months, detailed records were kept of the sailors' health. There was a +0.118 correlation between stress scale scores and illness, which was sufficient to support the hypothesis of a link between life events and illness.\n\nIn conjunction with the Cornell medical index assessing, the stress scale correlated with visits to medical dispensaries, and the H&R stress scale's scores also correlated independently with individuals dropping out of stressful underwater demolitions training due to medical problems. The scale was also assessed against different populations within the United States (with African, Mexican and White American groups). The scale was also tested cross-culturally, comparing Japanese and Malaysian groups with American populations.\n\nTo measure stress according to the Holmes and Rahe Stress Scale, the number of \"Life Change Units\" that apply to events in the past year of an individual's life are added and the final score will give a rough estimate of how stress affects health.\n\nScore of 300+: At risk of illness.\n\nScore of 150-299: Risk of illness is moderate (reduced by 30% from the above risk).\n\nScore <150: Only have a slight risk of illness.\n\nA modified scale has also been developed for non-adults.

Hwabyung is similar to Amuk. Hwabyung is known as a culture-bound syndrome.\n\nThe word hwabyung is composed of \"hwa\" (the Chinese-Korean word for \"fire\" which can also contextually mean \"anger\") and \"byung\" (the Chinese-Korean word for \"syndrome\" or \"illness\"). It may also be called \"ulhwabyeong\" (), literally \"depression anger illness\". In one survey, 4.1% of the general population in a rural area in Korea were reported as having hwabyung. \n\nPhysical symptoms include:\n\n\nPsychological symptoms include:\n\n\nDiagnosed patients may also have a medical history of prior major depressive disorder, dysthymic disorder, anxiety disorders, somatoform disorders, or adjustment disorder according to the \"Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders\", fourth edition (DSM-IV) criteria.\n\nDiagnosed patients are most likely to be middle-aged, post-menopausal women with low socio-economic status.\n\nUnderlying causes may include:\n\n\nTriggering causes are typically external events, including:\n\n\nThe syndrome itself is believed to be the result of the continued repression of feelings of anger without addressing their source. In holistic medicine the containment of anger in hwabyung disturbs the balance of the five bodily elements, resulting in the development of psychosomatic symptoms such as panic, insomnia, and depression after a long period of repressed feelings.\n\nIt is possible that hormonal imbalances such as those around the time of menopause may also be an underlying cause of hwabyung in middle-aged women, the most often-diagnosed demographic.\n\nWestern doctors are more likely to diagnose it as a kind of stress or depression. The \"Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders\" currently lists \"hwabyeong\" among its culture-bound illnesses. Outside of Korea, informally \"hwabyeong\" may be mistaken as a reference to a psychological profile marked by a short temper, or explosive, generally bellicose behavior. To the contrary, \"hwabyeong\" is a traditional psychological term used to refer to a condition characterized by passive suffering, is roughly comparable to depression, and is typically associated with older women. It is important that when diagnosing Hwabyeong, the culture of the patient is well understood. Since Hwabyeong can often be misdiagnosed as depression, the symptoms and culture need to be clearly and thoroughly looked into. Once Hwabyeong has been diagnosed, past treatments need to be reviewed. The treatments for the patient can then be a combination of pharmacological, and therapy-based interventions.\n\nThe treatment methods used to combat hwabyung include psychotherapy, drug treatment, family therapy, and community approaches. To be more successful psychiatrists might need to incorporate the teachings from traditional and religious healing methods or the use of han-puri, which is the sentiment of resolving, loosening, unraveling and appeasing negative emotions with positive ones. One example of hann-puri would be a mother who has suffered from poverty, less education, a violent husband, or a harsh mother-in-law, can be solved many years later by the success of her son for which she had endured hardships and sacrifices.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "27087", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=27087", "title": "Kes (Star Trek)", "text": "Kes (Star Trek)\n\nKes is a fictional character, portrayed by actress Jennifer Lien, who appears in the American science fiction television series \"\". Set in the 24th century, the series follows the adventures of the Starfleet and Maquis crew of the starship USS \"Voyager\" after they are stranded in the Delta Quadrant, far from the rest of the Federation. \n\nKes was born on stardate 2369 on the planet Ocampa in the Delta Quadrant. As part of the Ocampa species, she has telepathy and an average life expectancy of nine years. The Ocampa live in an underground city created by an alien known as the Caretaker, who had inadvertently destroyed the planet's atmosphere and ecosystem. The Caretaker provides food and water for the Ocampa, who become dependent on his care. Kes hopes to develop her psionic powers, which her ancestors were rumored to have possessed with great proficiency. After finding a way to the planet's surface, she is captured and tortured by the Kazon for access to the city and its resources. Neelix rescues her, and the pair become romantically involved. The Caretaker realizes he is dying and abducts beings from the Alpha Quadrant to find a suitable mate so he can reproduce and pass the responsibility of caring for the Ocampa to his offspring. \n\nIn \"\", he kidnaps Maquis members and the Starfleet crew of the starship USS \"Voyager\". Kes helps their captains Kathryn Janeway and Chakotay recover their missing crew members. Janeway destroys the Caretaker's vessel to prevent the Kazon from acquiring the technology, which strands both the Maquis and Starfleet crews in the Delta Quadrant. Kes and Neelix decide to help them as guides. \n\nWhile aboard USS \"Voyager\", Kes starts a hydroponics garden to provide vegetables and fruit for the crew's meals. She develops a close friendship with while studying to become his medical assistant. While helping the Doctor develop a better bedside manner and overall set of social skills, Kes pushes for the crew to treat him as a human instead of just a hologram. The Vidiians harvest Neelix's lung in \"\", leading to Kes donating one of her own to save his life. During \"Elogium\", emanations from space-dwelling lifeforms cause Kes to prematurely enter the elogium, the Ocampa female reproductive state. This condition can only occur once during a Ocampa life cycle. Kes and Neelix disagree over the idea of having children. Neelix eventually agrees to being a father, but Kes decides against conceiving a child. After leaving the lifeforms, the Doctor determines Kes had gone through a false alarm and would be able to go through the elogium in the future. \n\nWhen \"USS Voyager\" discovers a second Ocampa colony in \"\", Kes is tutored by its leader Tanis on how to expand her mental abilities. She was also being trained by Tuvok, though he took a more cautious approach focused on control. Under Tanis' tutelage, Kes develops pyrokinesis, but she is unable to control the power and almost kills Tuvok by boiling his blood. Kes discovers that Tanis is collaborating with the Caretaker's mate, Suspiria, to destroy the ship, and she subdues him with her powers. Kes is disturbed by the harm she can do with her abilities, though Tuvok reminds her that she must learn to control, rather than fear, such darker impulses. In \"\", Tieran takes control of Kes' body and uses her mental powers to stage a coup against his planet's dictator. While under Tieran's influence, Kes breaks up with Neelix. The crew eventually free Kes from Tieran's control and kill him, though she is traumatized by the experience. When the Doctor grafts other personalities into his program in \"\", he develop an evil alternate personality and kidnaps Kes after injuring her suitor, Zahir. Kes considers leaving USS \"Voyager\" for Zahir, though she later decides against this. \n\nIn \"\", Kes lives short periods of her life in reverse order, starting with her death and ending with her birth. In this alternative timeline, she Tom Paris, and they have a daughter, Linnis. Linnis marries Harry Kim, and they have a son. In this timeline, Kes participates in \"Voyager's\" year-long battle with the Krenim during the \"Year of Hell\", becoming infected with particles from a chronoton torpedo. The Doctor helps Kes return to normal temporal sync, and she documents information about the Krenim and their future attack. During \"\", USS \"Voyager\" becomes entangled in a major conflict between the Borg and Species 8472. Partially due to her exposure to the powerful telepathic influx of Species 8472, Kes begins to evolve into a different state of being. In \"\". she realizes she can no longer remain with \"Voyager\", as her powers threaten to destroy the ship. She uses her newly acquired powers to hurl \"Voyager\" and crew safely beyond Borg space, 9,500 light-years closer to Earth before turning into living energy. Kes revisits USS \"Voyager\" in \"\", in which she is near the end of life cycle and experiencing memory loss. She mistakenly believes that Janeway kidnapped her from Ocampa, and travels back in time to negotiate with the Vidiians; she promises to help them access the ship to harvest the crews' organs if they take her younger self home. After stopping this plan, Kes creates a hologram to remind her future self about her affection for the crew and how much they had cared for her. The older version of Kes says goodbye to the crew before taking her ship back to Ocampa. \n\nKes is featured in the novel trilogy \"Dark Matters\", where she is primarily shown gathering mutated dark matter. Referenced as the \"Entity\", Kes forgot portions of her past and slowly regains her memories over the course of the trilogy by returning the previous locations from the show. She decides to not contact the USS \"Voyager\" crew after being told she is an alternative version of Kes, different from the one present in \"Fury\". Despite this decision, Tuvok senses her presence before her final departure. The novel trilogy \"String Theory\" reveals the Kes from \"Fury\" was really the manifestation of her dark side, caused as a side effect during a confrontation with a renegade Nacene (the same species as the Caretaker). Kes reappears to help the Doctor and Q with the birth of a Ocampa-Nacene hybrid, where she acts as a surrogate mother for the child. In the 2012 novel \"The Eternal Tide\", Kes assists Q Junior in resurrecting Admiral Janeway after she is assimilated and the Borg Cube she was on was destroyed; Kes' actions restored Janeway's body to its most perfect state after Q was able to teach her how to pull her body back together. For the short story \"Restoration\", Kes sacrifices herself to revive Ocampa's ecosystem. A mirror universe version of the character is also included in several publications. Aside from these literary appearances, an action figure of Kes was also released.\n\nEarly development of \"\" began in July 1993, where producers initially imagined the Ocampa as an androgynous alien species. In later meetings, they further expanded the Ocampa as having a short lifespan similar to a Mayfly. Kes was intended to live for only seven years, with changes in her appearance planned for each season to emphasize her age progression. The androgyny concept was dropped, as the first cast description identified Kes as a female. The character was initially named Dah. Producers proposed a second Ocampa, shown near the end of his lifespan, as part of the main cast, though this idea was abandoned in favor of the character Neelix, who was a late addition to the series. Kes was initially created as a scout for USS \"Voyager\"'s journey through the Delta Quadrant, before Neelix assumed the role of the ship's guide. She was then reimagined as a medical intern instead. In an August 1993 memo, series creator Jeri Taylor suggested Kes have a superhuman ability and be caught in a war between two factions. Producers debated over the nature of the character's psychic powers, leading them to ask production associate Zayra Cabot and the Joan Pearce Research for information on parapsychology. They then agreed to portray Kes with \"some measure of telepathic ability\" for the pilot episode (\"Caretaker\"), with the intention of addressing it further in future episodes.\n\nWhen casting Kes, \"Caretaker\" director Winrich Kolbe looked for an actress that \"could be fragile, but with a steely will underneath\". The casting call specified only women in their early-twenties or younger were considered for the role. Producers hired Jennifer Lien based on her youth and their belief she could embody the character's \"somewhat childlike and fragile\" qualities and short life span. Lien was one of the first cast members hired for the series, and at the age of nineteen, she was its youngest actor. Author Stephen Edward Poe attributed her discomfort during promotional interviews to her age. Lien only had a basic understanding of the \"Star Trek\" franchise prior to receiving the part. She said this allowed her to approach her performance without anxiety. She had auditioned for the show due to the opportunity to play a new alien species, and explained \"it meant that anything could happen, offering me the chance to learn and grow as an actress\". Jennifer Gatti was considered as a runner-up for Kes, though she would later guest star in the episode \"\".\n\nRegarding Kes' role in \"Caretaker\", series creator Michael Piller said she was supposed to encourage the audience to care about Neelix. Piller was concerned the pilot was too \"passionless\" due to its focus on a action-adventure storyline over individual character development; he explained: \"The biggest danger in the pilot was in creating a story that nobody cared about.\" In June 1994, Robert Blackman created the costumes for the episode. He cited Kes' clothing as a challenge since producers were still unclear about the character and Lien was very introverted. He had presented a costume based on a sprite and featuring pastel colors, though this was rejected by producers following a wardrobe fitting. The Ocampa makeup was developed by Michael Westmore. While the early scenes of \"Caretaker\" were filmed, Lien tested various combinations of wigs and ear prosthetics; cinematographer Marvin V. Rush filmed each version for series creator Rick Berman to receive his final approval. For the show's first two seasons, it would take Lien three hours a day to get into her character's hair, make-up, and wardrobe. As the series progressed, Lien developed an allergic response to the ear prosthetics. Starting with the episode \"Before and After\", Kes was portrayed with longer hair that covered her ears to accommodate this.\n\nThe \"Caretaker\" script stated Kes was \"a dazzling, ethereal beauty, waifish and fragile\", with a \"dignity – her bearing, an alertness in her look, that suggests a being of powerful intelligence\". On the \"Star Trek\" official website, the character is described as \"a tough survivor and a bit of a rebel\". In a 1996 interview, Lien characterized her as \"strong and curious and intelligent\" despite still being \"a child in a way with the same fears and inhibitions and worries that we all have\". She saw the character's lack of \"cynicism or precociousness or pretentiousness or sarcasm\" as different from typical young female roles. While referring to \"this kind of diversity in a character\" as difficult to play, she enjoyed the process and said: \"It's a joy to pretend to be this extraordinary creature, so open and everything so new.\" Author Paul Ruditis summed up the role with the phrase \"fragile power\", which he identified as a paradox. During filming, Lien was not given information about her characters' future storylines prior to receiving the final copies of the scripts. Unlike the show's other actors, she did not campaign for changes to Kes, explaining \"I felt my contribution was more in the acting, and not in the writing\". Discussing the character's developing mental abilities, Lien felt \"it displays another side of Kes which is her confidence in being able to choose a path for her life\"; she associated temptation as a key part of her character's arc. Comic Book Resources' Angie Dahl cited Kes as one of the top twenty most powerful \"Star Trek\" characters based on her powers.\n\nKolbe interpreted Kes as the alter ego to Neelix, citing them as bringing romance and comedy to the series. Lien and Neelix's actor Ethan Phillips said they enjoyed filming their scenes together. Describing the couple as having a \"traditional young love\", Ruditis found Kes to be the more dominant partner do to her ability dispense emotion guidance. Although the relationship was introduced in the pilot, he referred to it as \"somewhat undefined as the series progressed\". Writer Kenneth Biller wanted to establish the pair as living together and sexually active, but Taylor and Berman thought Kes looked too young for those storylines. Biller proposed scenes in which the character talk about sex for the first time as a way to explore \"the weirdness of alien sexuality\". This discussion lead to dialogue being included in the episode \"Elogium\". Phillips requested the writers provide closure for the couple following their break-up; they denied his request, saying: \"No, let's just drop it, let's move on.\" Phillips viewed the break-up as \"muddy\" as it occurred as part of Kes' possession. Producers had planned a scene for the episode \"\", in which Kes and Neelix discuss the change in their relationships, but it was removed due to time constraints. Berman discussed the couple during a 1997 interview, saying: \"There was a relationship with Neelix that didn't work out that well.\" \n\nKes has a more parent-child relationship with Janeway and the Doctor, portrayed by Kate Mulgrew and Robert Picardo, respectively. Ruditis identified Kes' trust in Janeway as representing her desire to explore the universe. Picardo viewed Kes as the Doctor's \"sounding board\" and \"emotional confessor\", as she mentored him on being human. Following the removal of Kes from the show, Picardo was concerned the Doctor would be relegated to the role as the comic relief. He suggested producers inverse the Doctor's relationship with Kes to show him teaching Seven of Nine about humanity. Alternatively, a darker relationship between the Doctor and Kes was planned for the episode \"Darkling\". According to writer Joe Menosky, the Doctor's evil alter ego was intended to be \"perversely sexual and sadistic\" with a \"psychosexual\" attraction to Kes. Menosky had planned a scene in which the Doctor interacts with holograms of Kes on the holodeck, including performing surgery on one. Since B'Elanna Torres had few scenes with Kes, the character's actor Roxann Dawson requested for further interaction between the two.\n\nLien was removed from \"Star Trek: Voyager\" during its to accommodate the introduction of Jeri Ryan, who plays Seven of Nine. Chakotay's actor Robert Beltran said changing a lead character mid-season was unusual for the \"Star Trek\" franchise, though Taylor believed it was typical for a show in its later seasons. Media outlets believed Harry Kim's actor Garrett Wang was going to be replaced instead, but was kept due to his appeal to a specific demographic and his placement on \"People\"'s \"50 Most Beautiful People in the World\" list. Wang said: \"The timing of that, right during our hiatus, certainly couldn't have hurt me in terms of them keeping me on the show.\" Berman and Taylor choose to remove Kes since they felt the character was not properly developed over the course of the show. Executive producer Brannon Braga regarded this decision as a \"failure of imagination on the writers’ part\". Braga requested freelance writer Bryan Fuller develop the concept for Kes' departure. Receiving a positive response during a pitch meeting, Fuller helped to rewrite the character's final episode \"The Gift\". He said he had \"really bonded\" with Kes during the episode's production. Juliette Harrison of \"Den of Geek!\" listed her exit as part of the franchise's frequent depiction of a character ascending to a higher plane of existence; Wesley Crusher and Benjamin Sisko were cited as other examples.\n\nProducers invited Lien to return for the episode \"Fury\" as they wanted to use her character \"to move the story forward\". Berman said he promised the actress that the episode would be \"a terrific story, and thus a good reason to bring Kes back\". Lien retained her \"also starring\" billing from season four. Braga developed the concept for \"Fury\", which was written by Fuller and Michael Taylor. Anna L. Kaplan of \"Cinefantastique\" described Fuller's involvement as \"ironic\" given his participation in the character's exit. Lien requested that the script be rewritten as she was uncomfortable with it. She did not have the same allergic response to the ear prosthetics since she did not have to wear them for the same length of time. Prior to the episode, Lien had stopped acting to pursue an associate degree in health. When discussing her approach, she felt it was difficult to play a different version of Kes and interact with the other characters who had changed since her last appearance. Lien preferred her performance in \"The Gift\" over \"Fury\", saying she made \"a lot of poor acting choices\" in the latter.\n\nLien's performance received some positive feedback. In a review of \"Caretaker\", \"Variety\"'s Kinsey Lowe praised Lien's performance as a \"beguiling blend of naive wonder and fierce dedication\". Michelle Erica Green of \"Trek Today\" wrote the actress could \"make even the silliest of dialogue sound convincing and the most generic of storylines compelling\"; Green praised her performances in the episodes \"Cold Fire\", \"Warlord\", and \"Before and After\" as standouts. Screen Rant's Alexandra August wrote that Lien \"did her best with what she was given\" though felt the actress could not make the character \"dynamic\" enough. Kes' removal in season four was praised by critics, who believed the character was poorly developed. Describing Kes as \"forgettable\", Chris Snellgrove of Screen Rant cited her as an example of how certain characters were underused. Other contributors for the publication felt Kes had potential if storylines further exploring her short lifespan and mental powers. August wrote that Kes was \"an interesting character on paper\", and Thompson cited the Ocampa as one of the more fascinating species introduced on \"Star Trek: Voyager\". Larry Bonko of \"The Virginian-Pilot\" was disappointed by Kes' exit, as he felt the character \"gave the series heart\".\n\nKes' relationship with Neelix was the subject of frequent criticism. Matt Wright of TrekMovie.com panned the couple as \"borderline gross\", while Thompson cited them as having the worst chemistry on the series. Thompson and Gizmodo's Tom Pritchard felt Kes would benefited as a character without Neelix. August was critical of the frequency in which Kes' storylines revolved around her love life. On the other hand, Thompson praised Paris' attraction for Kes as \"a good setup relationship to guide him into being a better and more responsible man for B'Elanna\". Kes' relationship with Tuvok received a mixed response. During her review of the episode \"Cold Fire\", Green praised their bond as striking a \"balance between her youthful optimism and his mature logic\". August wrote their \"mutual respect for and a natural curiosity about one another\" could lead to an ideal romance if Tuvok was not already married. Alternatively, English literature professor David Greven criticized the characters' difference in race and age as uncomfortably similar to Uncle Tom's friendship with Little Eva in the 1852 novel \"Uncle Tom's Cabin\".\n\nCritics had a mixed response to Kes' storyline for \"Elogium\". Green and \"Bustle\"'s Marie Southard Ospina praised the episode's depiction of a woman choosing to not have a baby without receiving judgement. On the other hand, Writer David A. McIntee criticized the elogium as a poorly-done metaphor for puberty, PMS, teenage pregnancy, abortion, and menopause. Commentators questions the plausibility of an Ocampa woman only giving birth once as it would cause an inevitable decrease in the specie's population. Kes' return for \"Fury\" received negative feedback from reviewers, who found her characterization to be disappointing. John Andrew of \"Den of Geek!\" cited the episode as a \"sad yet compelling character study\", though he felt it had a \"fairly pat resolution\" to Kes' change in morality. \"Trek Today\"'s Edward James Hines felt it would difficult to watch previous episodes with the knowledge that \"[Kes'] levelheaded, peaceful, inquisitive demeanor is only setting itself up for a terrible shock down the line\". August criticized the writers for \"undermining [the character's] entire journey after leaving Voyager\" to \"capitalize on a demonized Kes\". \"Trek Today\" contributors questioned why the episode did not change the timeline further, such as Janeway and Tuvok's inaction in changing Kes' future decline.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "53670637", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=53670637", "title": "Mental health of Filipino Americans", "text": "Mental health of Filipino Americans\n\nThe mental health of Filipino Americans is emotional and cognitive status of Americans of Filipino descent. Filipino Americans are more likely to suffer from mental illness than other Asian Americans due to a variety of social and economic factors.\n\nAccording to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, young Filipino women are more likely to think of committing suicide than most minorities. 13.6% are diagnosed with depression. Filipinos are diagnosed with depression more than Caucasians and the majority of Americans. Mothers in Filipino families are more likely to have acute depression.\n\nThe after-effects of colonialism still influence various Filipino immigrants. Compared to Asian Pacific Islanders, Filipinos are more likely to be diagnosed with schizophrenia. Studies show that Asian Americans have more serious disorders and have more prolonged stays at mental institutions than Caucasians.\n\nImmigration is one associated with mental illness in Filipinos. Filipino immigrants take part in fewer mental health services than other Americans. Filipino Americans were once immigrants. Filipinos are one of the largest groups of Asian-American immigrants. About 1.66 million Filipinos are immigrants. Some Filipino immigrants do not apply for programs such as Medicaid because they are worried that it would reduce their chances of becoming citizens. \n\nAsian American immigrants are diagnosed with depression for various factors, such as not understanding English or inability to take health exams. The Filipino American Community Epidemiological Study (FACES) examined situations that may cause mental illness in Filipino immigrants. Employment worries increase stress, which can cause mental illness. Males who do not know English well enough are more prone to mental illness than English speakers. Female immigrants were more likely to have long-term disorders. Males are more susceptible to disorders that lead them to depend on alcohol and drugs.\n\nSeveral models have been constructed to characterize the Filipino-American experience. These theories include the Identity Development Model, colonial mentality and the Model Minority Myth.\n\nFilipino Americans experience racial and ethnic identity development in a different way, than other Asian American groups. The Philippines was colonized by Spain for over 300 years, and came to partially identify itself with Spain. However, Filipino Americans also identify with Asian and/or Pacific Islanders, leaving Filipino Americans with the possibility of multiple (or compound) racial and ethnic identities. The identity development model contains six stages that Filipino Americans may experience as they develop their identity. These stages include: ethnic awareness, assimilation to American culture, awareness of socio-political differences, Panethnic Asian American consciousness, ethnocentric realization and introspection or acceptance.\n\nEthnic awareness develops when an individual becomes aware of the culture associated with their ethnicity. This includes language, social activities, food, music and traditions. Typically this stage arrives during childhood. During the assimilation stage, the individual notices the differences between her ethnic culture and other cultures and assimilates with one or more such cultures. Typically this is some flavor of American culture. American values and traits are typically presented as preferable or even superior. For example, skin-whitening and bleaching products are promoted as a way to become more attractive.\n\nDuring the \"Awareness of Social/Political Differences\" stage, Filipino Americans become actively aware of traits that separate them from other cultures, often sensitized by racial and cultural injustices. Differences can be interpreted positively (e.g., by coming to appreciate Filipino culture) or negatively (via experiencing racism). \n\nThe \"Panethnic Asian-American Consciousness\" stage occurs when individuals begin to associate with individuals of other Asian American groups and learn that such groups have much in common with them. \n\nThe \"Ethnocentric Identity and Introspection\" stage is the rejection of a broader Asian American identity and in favor or a specific Filipino identity. \n\nThe final Introspection stage is the acceptance of their other identities (e.g., as an Asian) without rejecting their Filipino heritage.\n\nColonial mentality is a form of internalized oppression in which an individual feels inferior because his heritage includes the experience of colonization. This mentality makes individual feel the need to associate more towards American and/or Spanish values and traditions rather than their own, perceiving their colonizer to be superior.\n\nColonial mentality has been shown to impacts the psychological well-being of Filipino Americans. Those strongly affected are more likely to have low self-esteem and could develop symptoms of depression more often than others. The four levels of impact on an individual: self-denigration, lack of appreciation of Filipino culture, discrimination against less-cultured individuals, and tolerance and acceptance of oppression by non-Filipinos.\n\nModel minority is a stereotypical assumption that members of a particular ethnic group excel in areas of behavior and education. Stereotypes that apply specifically to Filipino Americans include: low divorce rate, propensity to speak English better than other Asian Americans and lower poverty rate among Asian Americans. Stereotypes of Filipino Americans include academic success among women.\n\nModel minority stereotypes pressure Filipino Americans to live up to their image. Students have been seen to question whether or not they are actually Asian if they are unable to match the stereotype. This affects individuals' self-esteem.\n\n"}

{"id": "3055427", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=3055427", "title": "Nutrition and pregnancy", "text": "Nutrition and pregnancy\n\nNutrition and pregnancy refers to the nutrient intake, and dietary planning that is undertaken before, during and after pregnancy. Nutrition of the fetus begins at conception. For this reason, the nutrition of the mother is important from before conception (probably several months before) as well as throughout pregnancy and breast feeding. An ever-increasing number of studies have shown that the nutrition of the mother will have an effect on the child, up to and including the risk for cancer, cardiovascular disease, hypertension and diabetes throughout life.\n\nAn inadequate or excessive amount of some nutrients may cause malformations or medical problems in the fetus, and neurological disorders and handicaps are a risk that is run by mothers who are malnourished. An estimated 24% of babies worldwide are born with lower than optimal weights at birth due to lack of proper nutrition. Personal habits such as consumption of alcohol or large amounts of caffeine can negatively and irreversibly affect the development of the baby, which happens in the early stages of pregnancy.\n\nCaffeine consumption during pregnancy is associated with increased risk of pregnancy loss. The available research favors the notion that the benefits of fish consumption during pregnancy outweigh the risks; however, the type of fish is important. Folic acid, which is the synthetic form of the vitamin folate, is critical both in pre-and peri-conception. \n\nAs with most diets, there are chances of over-supplementing, however, as general advice, both state and medical recommendations are that mothers follow instructions listed on particular vitamin packaging as to the correct or recommended daily allowance (RDA). Daily prenatal use of iron substantially improves birth weight, potentially reducing the risk of Low birth weight.\n\n\nThe United States and the European Union have established vitamin and mineral recommendations for during pregnancy and lactation. The amounts in the table below are the higher of the two. The citations separately list recommendations for pregnancy and lactation. Recommendations (RDAs = Recommended Dietary Allowances and PRIs = Population Reference Intakes) are set higher than what has been determined to be average requirements so as to address women who have above average needs. For some nutrients there is not enough information to set a recommendation, so the term Adequate Intake (AI) is used based on what appears to be sufficient.\n\n<nowiki>*</nowiki>Adequate Intake\n†Not established. EU has not identified an AI for sodium or chloride, and does not consider chromium to be an essential mineral nutrient.\n\nMultiple micronutrient supplements taken with iron and folic acid can improve birth outcomes for women in low income countries. These supplements reduce numbers of low birth weight babies, small for gestational age babies and stillbirths in women who may not have many micronutrients in their usual diets. Undernourished women can benefit from having dietary education sessions and, balanced energy and protein supplements. A review showed that dietary education increased the mother’s protein intake and helped the baby grow more inside the womb. The balanced protein and energy supplement lowered risk of stillbirth and small babies and increased weight gain for both the mother and baby. Although more research is needed into the longer term effects on the mothers’ and infants’ health, the short term effects look promising.\n\nSupplementing one's diet with foods rich in folic acid, fruits and dark green leafy vegetables helps to prevent neural tube birth defects in the fetus. In addition, prenatal vitamins typically contain increased amounts of folic acid, iodine, iron, vitamin A, vitamin D, zinc, and calcium over the amounts found in standard multi-vitamins. Zinc supplements have reduced preterm births by around 14% mainly in low income countries where zinc deficiency is common. However, the World Health Organisation does not routinely recommend zinc supplementation for all pregnant women.\n\nFor women with low calcium diets, taking calcium supplementation can reduce their risk of preeclampsia. It has also been suggested that calcium can reduce numbers of births that happen before the 37th week of pregnancy (preterm birth). However a more recent review looking into other benefits of calcium supplementation did not find any improvement in numbers of preterm or low birth weight babies. There is not enough good quality to research to suggest best doses and timing of calcium supplementation.\n\nPregnant women are advised to pay attention to the foods they eat during pregnancy in order to reduce the risk of exposure to substances or bacteria that may be harmful to the developing fetus. This can include potentially harmful pathogens such as listeria, toxoplasmosis, and salmonella. Intake of large amounts of retinol has been linked to birth defects and abnormalities. Although seafood contains high levels of Omega-3 fatty acids which are beneficial for both mother and the baby, but there is no consensus on consuming seafood during pregnancy. Pregnant women are advised to eat seafood in moderation.\n\nDuring pregnancy, a woman's mass increases by about 12 kg (26 lb). The European Food Safety Authority recommends an increase of 300 mL per day compared to the normal intake for non-pregnant women, taking the total adequate water intake (from food and fluids) to 2,300 mL, or approximately 1,850 mL/ day from fluids alone\n\nA mother's nutritional intake during pregnancy is believed to influence and possibly offer protective effects against the development of allergenic diseases and asthma in children. Maternal intake of vitamin D, vitamin E, and zinc have all been associated with a lower likelihood of wheezing in childhood, suggesting a protective effect. Additionally, maternal intake of omega-3 long chain polyunsaturated fatty acids (n-3 LC-PUFAs) has been associated with a reduced risk of development of eczema in childhood and reduced likelihood to for infants exhibit sensitivity to foods in the first year of life.\n\nCaffeine consumption during pregnancy is associated with increased risk of pregnancy loss and increased risk of low birth weight, defined as below 2500 grams (5.5 pounds). The European Food Safety Authority and the American Congress of Obstetricians and Gynecologists concur that habitual caffeine consumption up to 200 mg per day by pregnant women does not give rise to safety concerns for the fetus. The United Kingdom Food Standards Agency had recommended that pregnant women should limit their caffeine intake to less than 300 mg of caffeine a day, but in 2009 revised that downward to less than 200 mg of caffeine a day.\n\nFetal alcohol spectrum disorders are a group of conditions that can occur in a person whose mother drank alcohol during pregnancy. The most severe form of the condition is known as fetal alcohol syndrome. Problems may include an abnormal appearance, short height, low body weight, small head size, poor coordination, low intelligence, behavior problems, hearing loss and vision problems. Those affected are more likely to have trouble in school, legal problems, participate in high-risk behaviors, and have trouble with alcohol and recreational drug use. Fetal alcohol syndrome usually occurs when a pregnant woman has more than four drinks per day. Milder symptoms have been found with two drinks per day during the early part of pregnancy. Evidence of harm from less than two drinks per day or 10 drinks per week is not clear.\n\nThe American Academy of Pediatrics established a conservative set of recommendations in 2015: \"During pregnancy:no amount of alcohol intake should be considered safe; there is no safe trimester to drink alcohol; all forms of alcohol, such as beer, wine, and liquor, pose similar risk; and binge drinking poses dose-related risk to the developing fetus.\" The World Health Organization recommends that alcohol should be avoided entirely during pregnancy, given the relatively unknown effects of even small amounts of alcohol during pregnancy.\n\nFish consumption during pregnancy is encouraged by European, Australian, and American guidelines. The reason given is that fat-containing fish such as salmon and tuna contain eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA). These are termed long chain, omega-3, polyunsaturated fatty acids, and are considered as important for fetal neurodevelopment. Additionally, fish are good sources of vitamins A, D, and B12, as well as the mineral iodine.\n\nDue to risks of heavy-metal toxicity on fetal neurodevelopment, many mothers are concerned about eating fish during pregnancy. Overall, current research favors the notion that the benefits of fish consumption during pregnancy outweigh the risks; however, the type of fish is important. Current research suggests that 2-3 servings of low-methylmercury containing fish per week in pregnancy is both safe and beneficial. Mercury accumulates in fish through their own diet (bioaccumulation). A general rule of thumb is that fish higher up on the food chain, and with longer life spans will contain higher levels of mercury. Fish lower on the food chain and with shorter life spans will have lower metal content. However, it is important to note that the bioaccumulation of metals in fish is also dependent on geographical location, so it is hard to make global recommendations on specific fish species. An alternative to consuming fish is to use fish oil dietary supplements containing both EPA and DHA, or algae-derived DHA-only oils. The New York Times reported on a laboratory evaluation of 30 popular fish oil supplements. Some of those had less than the label claimed amounts of DHA. As for safety, \"All of the products tested contained only very low levels of mercury, ranging from one to six parts per billion per serving. That range is far below the upper safety limit of 100 parts per billion set by the Global Organization for EPA and DHA Omega-3s, an industry trade group.\"\n\nFolic acid, which is the synthetic form of the vitamin folate, is critical both in pre-and peri-conception. Deficiencies in folic acid may cause neural tube defects (NTDs). Women who had 0.4 mg of folic acid in their systems due to supplementing 3 months before childbirth significantly reduced the risk of NTDs. More than 80 countries use fortification of certain foods with folic acid as a measure to decrease the rate of NTDs.\n\nThe combination of vitamin E and vitamin C supplemented to pregnant women does not appear to be efficacious for reducing risk of stillbirth, neonatal death, preterm birth, preeclampsia or any other maternal or infant outcomes, either in healthy women or those considered at risk for pregnancy complications. Antioxidant vitamins as dietary supplements had been proposed as having benefits if consumed during pregnancy. For the combination of vitamin E with vitamin C supplemented to pregnant women, a Cochrane review of 21 clinical trials concluded that the data do not support vitamin E supplementation - majority of trials alpha-tocopherol at 400 IU/day plus vitamin C at 1000 mg/day - as being efficacious for reducing risk of stillbirth, neonatal death, preterm birth, preeclampsia or any other maternal or infant outcomes, either in healthy women or those considered at risk for pregnancy complications. The review identified only three small trials in which vitamin E was supplemented without co-supplementation with vitamin C. None of these trials reported any clinically meaningful information. A second Cochrane review of 29 trials, published same year, reported on the same combination trials but added analysis of trials with vitamin C alone. The conclusion was that the data do not support routine vitamin C supplementation alone or in combination with other supplements for the prevention of fetal or neonatal death, poor fetal growth, preterm birth or preeclampsia.\n\nProper nutrition is important after delivery to help the mother recover, and to provide enough food energy and nutrients for a woman to breastfeed her child. Women having serum ferritin less than 70 µg/L may need iron supplements to prevent iron deficiency anaemia during pregnancy and postpartum.\n\nDuring lactation, water intake may need to be increased. Human milk is made of 88% water, and the IOM recommends that breastfeeding women increase their water intake by about 300 mL/day to a total volume of 3000 mL/day (from food and drink); approximately 2,400 mL/day from fluids.\n\n\n"}

It is claimed that Syokimau could predict impeding attacks from other communities such as the Maasai and Gikuyu giving Kamba warriors ample time to prepare for the defense.\nSyokimau is credited as the greatest prophetess among the Kamba people because she foretold the coming of the white men and the construction of the railway line. In her vision, she saw a long snake belching fire and smoke as to moved from waters to another waters. In it there were people with skin like meat who spoke unintelligibly like birds and carried fire in their pockets.

{"id": "29070672", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=29070672", "title": "Race and health in the United States", "text": "Race and health in the United States\n\nResearch on race and health in the United States shows many health disparities between the different racial/ethnic groups. The possible causes, such as genetics, socioeconomic factors, and racism, continue to be debated. Different health problems, in both mental and physical health, are present in all races but are not always equally treated. Health care professionals show \"implicit bias\" in the way that they treat patients. In America, racism consists of stereotypes mainly that are political and economic. While this article focuses mainly on racism towards African Americans in the health field, it covers various other backgrounds including racism towards Native Americans, Asian Americans, and others while drawing comparisons between various incomes and ages. Race and health in the United States is a topic that has been researched many times over the years. There are various specific diseases that are more present among various races as well as different means for life expectancy.\n\nIn biomedical research conducted in the U.S., the 2000 US census definition of race is often applied. According to the Census Bureau in 2000, race refers to one's self-identification with a certain racial group. The Bureau also specifies that race is a social concept, and has no relation to science or anthropology. This grouping recognizes five \"races\": black or African American, White (European American), Asian, native Hawaiian or other Pacific Islander, and American Indian or Alaska native. According to the Journal of Behavioral Medicine, America continues to become more diverse. Although the population is increasingly less homogeneous, healthcare is unequally distributed among these five racial groups. The 2000 U.S. Census further specifies the amount of Americans who identified with each racial group; in 2000, 34.6 million identified as African American, 10.2 million as Asian American, and 35.3 million as Hispanic or Latino. It is important to consider that the 2000 U.S. Census definition is inconsistently applied across the range of studies that address race as a medical factor, making assessment of the utility of racial categorization in medicine more difficult.\nHowever, this definition is inconsistently applied across the range of studies that address race as a medical factor, making assessment of the utility of racial categorization in medicine more difficult. Bias stems from racism, creating stress on the race that is being discriminated against, leading to issues with a person's bodily and mental health. Repeated stress overtime on one’s body can lead to health problems such as depression, anxiety, insomnia, heart disease, skin rashes, and gastrointestinal problems, which are also more likely to develop in children. Racism has many detrimental effects on the health of Americans across the entire country, arising mainly from limited access to healthcare, mental health resources, and support. There are a wide range of patterns of health disparities that are caused by different levels of income across ethnic groups. Anthony Ong, a professor at Cornell University’s College of Human Ecology conveyed that this regular treatment of discrimination and backlash can have detrimental effects to a person’s self-esteem and can take opportunities of individuals. It can also cause individuals from being able to receive a full nights sleep.\n\nStress can be derived from many individualistic factors or experiences,has multiple effects on health. Stress is also associated with chronic diseases. Stress that is derived from racism has specific contextual factors, which adds a daily burden to African-Americans and other demographic groups that are discriminated against. These demographic groups do not often realize that these stressors may be contributing to the state of their mental health. Groups of people are also affected in ways that may not be outward acts of racism by another person, but through education, economics, the justice system, and largely through law enforcement. It is also possible that people who hold racist ideals have mental health problems as well, such as self-centeredness, inability to empathize, and paranoia over groups of people they are discriminating against. Individuals can develop complexes about ethnic groups and races, automatically displaying emotions without learning about the people themselves, and will cut off all friendliness to them.\n\nThe twentieth century witnessed a great expansion of the upper bounds of the human life span. At the beginning of the century, average life expectancy in the United States was 47 years. By century's end, the average life expectancy had risen to over 70 years, and it was not unusual for Americans to exceed 80 years of age. However, although longevity in the U.S. population has increased substantially, race disparities in longevity have been persistent. African American life expectancy at birth is persistently five to seven years lower than European Americans.\n\nThe vast majority of studies focus on the black-white contrast, but a rapidly growing literature describes variations in health status among America's increasingly diverse racial populations. Today, Asian Americans live the longest (87.1 years), followed by Latinos (83.3 years), whites (78.9 years), Native Americans (76.9 years), and African Americans (75.4 years). Where people live, combined with race and income, play a huge role in whether they may die young. A 2001 study found large racial differences exist in healthy life expectancy at lower levels of education.\n\nA study by Jack M. Guralnik, Kenneth C. Land, Dan Blazer, Gerda G. Fillenbaum, and Laurence G. Branch found that education had a substantially stronger relation to total life expectancy and active life expectancy than did race. Still, sixty-five-year-old black men had a lower total life expectancy (11.4 years) and active life expectancy (10 years) than white men (total life expectancy, 12.6 years; active life expectancy, 11.2 years) The differences were reduced when the data were controlled for education.\n\nDuring the 20th century, the difference in life expectancy between black and white men in the United States did not decline.\n\nA study by Christopher Murray contends the differences are so stark it is \"as if there are eight separate Americas instead of one.\" Leading the nation in longevity are Asian-American women who live in Bergen County, N.J., and typically reach their 91st birthdays, concluded Murray's county-by-county analysis. On the opposite extreme are Native American men in swaths of South Dakota, who die around 58.\n\n\nThe risks for many diseases are elevated for socially, economically, and politically disadvantaged groups in the United States, suggesting that socioeconomic inequities are the root causes of most of the differences. However, other dimensions of inequality than those reflected by socioeconomic status also affect racial disparities in health, because other forms of social adversity are also important factors.\n\nHealth disparities are well documented in minority populations such as African Americans, Native Americans, and Latinos. When compared to European Americans and Asian Americans, these minority groups have higher incidence of chronic diseases, higher mortality, and poorer health outcomes.\n\nMinorities also have higher rates of cardiovascular disease, HIV/AIDS, and infant mortality than whites. U.S. ethnic groups can exhibit substantial average differences in disease incidence, disease severity, disease progression, and response to treatment.\n\n\nAfrican American women are three to four times more likely to die in childbirth than white women, while their babies are twice as likely to die than white babies, even when controlled for many factors such as education, income, and health. “White racism” is the highest cause of unrest in communities, pushing them further apart, and causing more black women and infants to die because of it. Racism in education has decreased significantly over the past century, however this does not help increases in income for blacks, and increased incomes don’t provide better health opportunities, especially for mothers and infants. Higher education and income levels for black mothers does not effect this mortality rate. There are also higher chances that a complication will occur during birth. The ‘toxin’ of these rates is racism, which has created a toxic environment for minority groups to live in with multiple stressors that effect health.\n\nDisparities in health and life span among blacks and whites in the US have existed since before the period of slavery. David R. Williams and Chiquita Collins write that, although racial taxonomies are socially constructed and arbitrary, race is still one of the major bases of division in American life. Throughout US history racial disparities in health have been pervasive. In a 2001 paper, Williams and Collins also argued that, although it is no longer being legally enforced, racial segregation is still one of the primary causes of racial disparities in health because it determines socioeconomic status by limiting access to education and employment opportunities.\nClayton and Byrd write that there have been two periods of health reform specifically addressing the correction of race-based health disparities. The first period (1865–1872) was linked to Freedmen's Bureau legislation and the second (1965–1975) was a part of the Civil Rights Movement. Both had dramatic and positive effects on black health status and outcome, but were discontinued. Even though African-American health status and outcome is slowly improving, black health has generally stagnated or deteriorated compared to whites since 1980.\n\nDemographic changes can have broad effects on the health of ethnic groups. Cities in the United States have undergone major social transitions during the 1970s 1980s and 1990s. Notable factors in these shifts have been sustained rates of black poverty and intensified racial segregation, often as a result of redlining. Indications of the effect of these social forces on black-white differentials in health status have begun to surface in the research literature.\n\nRace has played a decisive role in shaping systems of medical care in the United States. The divided health system persists, in spite of federal efforts to end segregation, health care remains, at best widely segregated both exacerbating and distorting racial disparities. Furthermore, the risks for many diseases are elevated for socially, economically, and politically disadvantaged groups in the United States, suggesting to some that environmental factors and not genetics are the causes of most of the differences.\n\nRacial differences in health often persist even at equivalent socioeconomic levels. Individual and institutional discrimination, along with the stigma of inferiority, can adversely affect health. Racism can also directly affect health in multiple ways. Residence in poor neighborhoods, racial bias in medical care, the stress of experiences of discrimination and the acceptance of the societal stigma of inferiority can have deleterious consequences for health. Racism is a key determinant of socioeconomic status (SES) in the United States, and SES, in turn, is a fundamental cause of racial inequities in health. Using The Schedule of Racist Events (SRE), an 18-item self-report inventory that assesses the frequency of racist discrimination. Hope Landrine and Elizabeth A. Klonoff found that racist discrimination was frequent in the lives of African Americans and is strongly correlated to psychiatric symptoms.\n\nA study on racist events in the lives of African American women found that lifetime racism was positively correlated to lifetime history of both physical disease and frequency of recent common colds. These relationships were largely unaccounted for by other variables. Demographic variables such as income and education were not related to experiences of racism. The results suggest that racism can be detrimental to African American's well being. The physiological stress caused by racism has been documented in studies by Claude Steele, Joshua Aronson, and Steven Spencer on what they term \"stereotype threat.\"\n\nKennedy et al. found that both measures of collective disrespect were strongly correlated with black mortality (r = 0.53 to 0.56), as well as with white mortality (r = 0.48 to 0.54). A 1 percent increase in the prevalence of those who believed that blacks lacked innate ability was associated with an increase in age-adjusted black mortality rate of 359.8 per 100,000 (95% confidence interval: 187.5 to 532.1 deaths per 100,000). These data suggest that racism, measured as an ecologic characteristic, is associated with higher mortality in both blacks and whites.\n\nPrinceton Survey Research Associates found that in 1999 most whites were unaware that race and ethnicity may affect the quality and ease of access to health care.\n\nThere is a great deal of research into inequalities in health care. In 2003, the Institute of Medicine released a report showing that race and ethnicity were significantly associated with the quality of healthcare received, even after controlling for socioeconomic factors such as access to care. In some cases these inequalities are a result of income and a lack of health insurance, a barrier to receiving services. Almost two-thirds (62 percent) of Hispanic adults aged 19 to 64 (15 million people) were uninsured at some point during the past year, a rate more than triple that of working-age white adults (20 percent). One-third of working-age black adults (more than 6 million people) were also uninsured or experienced a gap in coverage during the year. Blacks had the most problems with medical debt, with 61 percent of uninsured black adults reporting medical bill or debt problems, vs. 56 percent of whites and 35 percent of Hispanics.\n\nCompared with white women, black women are twice as likely and Hispanic women are nearly three times as likely to be uninsured. However, a survey conducted in 2009, which examined whether patient race influences physician's prescribing, found that racial differences in outpatient prescribing patterns for hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, and diabetes are likely attributable to factors other than prescribing decisions based on patient race. Medications were recommended at comparable rates for hypercholesterolemia, hypertension and diabetes between Caucasians and African Americans.\n\nIt has been argued that other cases inequalities in health care reflect a systemic bias in the way medical procedures and treatments are prescribed for different ethnic groups. Raj Bhopal writes that the history of racism in science and medicine shows that people and institutions behave according to the ethos of their times and warns of dangers to avoid in the future.\nNancy Krieger contended that much modern research supported the assumptions needed to justify racism. Racism underlies unexplained inequities in health care, including treatment for heart disease, renal failure, bladder cancer, and pneumonia. Raj Bhopal writes that these inequalities have been documented in numerous studies. The consistent and repeated findings that black Americans receive less health care than white Americans—particularly where this involves expensive new technology—is an indictment of American health care.\n\nThe infant mortality rate for African Americans is approximately twice the rate for European Americans, but, in a study that looked at members of these two groups who belonged to the military and received care through the same medical system, their infant mortality rates were essentially equivalent. Recently a study was conducted by the KFF, the Henry J Kaiser Family Foundation, in order to learn more about the infant mortality rate throughout the United States. All fifty states were surveyed. Different distributions of racial categories used in the study includes, \"Non-Hispanic White, Non-Hispanic Black, American Indian or Alaska Native, Asian or Pacific Islander, or Hispanic\". The infant mortality rate was compiled by the number of infant deaths per one thousand live births. In 2015, on an average nationwide, the United States reported that for Non-Hispanic white had a infant mortality rate of NSD meaning there as not enough sufficient data, Non-Hispanic black's rate was 11.3, Indian or Alaska Native's was 8.3, Pacific Islander was 4.2, and the infant mortality rate on average for Hispanic was 5.0.\n\nRecent immigrants to the United States from Mexico have better indicators on some measures of health than do Mexican Americans who are more assimilated into American culture. Diabetes and obesity are more common among Native Americans living on U.S. reservations than among those living outside reservations. The number of Native Americans diagnosed increased by 29% just between the years of 1990 and 1997. The prevalence of this among women and men shows that women more often have diabetes than men, especially in communities of Native American people.\n\nA report from Wisconsin’s Department of Health and Family Services showed that while black women are more likely to die from breast cancer, white women are more likely to be diagnosed with breast cancer. Even after diagnosis, black women are less likely to get treatment compared to white women. University of Wisconsin African-American studies Professor Michael Thornton said the report’s results show racism still exists today. \"There’s a lot of research that suggests that who gets taken seriously in hospitals and doctors’ offices is related to race and gender,\" Thornton said. \"It’s related to the fact that many black women are less likely to be taken seriously compared to the white women when they go in for certain illnesses.\"\n\nKrieger writes that given growing appreciation of how race is a social, not biological, construct, some epidemiologists are proposing that studies omit data on \"race\" and instead collect better socioeconomic data. Krieger writes that this suggestion ignores a growing body of evidence on how noneconomic as well as economic aspects of racial discrimination are embodied and harm health across the lifecourse. Gilbert C. Gee's study \"A Multilevel Analysis of the Relationship Between Institutional and Individual Racial Discrimination and Health Status\" found that individual (self-perceived) and institutional (segregation and redlining) racial discrimination is associated with poor health status among members of an ethnic group.\n\nResearch has explored the effect of encounters with racism or discrimination on physiological activity. Most of the research has focused on traits that cause exaggerated responses, such as neuroticism, strong racial identification, or hostility. Several studies suggest that higher blood pressure levels are associated with a tendency not to downplay racist and discriminatory incidents, or that directly addressing or challenging unfair situations reduces blood pressure. Personal experiences of racist behaviors increase stress and blood pressure.\n\nAlthough the relationship racism and health is unclear and findings have been inconsistent, three likely mechanisms for cardiovascular damage have been identified:\n\nIt has been argued that while actual racism continues to harm health, fear of racism, due to historical precedents, can also cause some minority populations to avoid seeking medical help. For example, a 2003 study found that a large percentage of respondents perceived discrimination targeted at African American women in the area of reproductive health. Likewise beliefs such as \"The government is trying to limit the Black population by encouraging the use of condoms\" have also been studied as possible explanations for the different attitudes of whites and blacks towards efforts to prevent the spread of HIV/AIDS.\n\nInfamous examples of real racism in the past, such as the Tuskegee Syphilis Study (1932–1972), have injured the level of trust in the Black community towards public health efforts. The Tuskegee study deliberately left Black men diagnosed with syphilis untreated for 40 years. It was the longest nontherapeutic experiment on human beings in medical history. The AIDS epidemic has exposed the Tuskegee study as a historical marker for the legitimate discontent of Blacks with the public health system. The false belief that AIDS is a form of genocide is rooted in recent experiences of real racism. These theories range from the belief that the government promotes drug abuse in Black communities to the belief that HIV is a manmade weapon of racial warfare. Researchers in public health hope that open and honest conversations about racism in the past can help rebuild trust and improve the health of people in these communities.\n\nEnvironmental racism is the intentional or unintentional targeting of minority communities for the siting of polluting industries such as toxic waste disposal, through the race-based differential enforcement of environmental rules and regulations and exclusion of people of color from public and private boards and regulatory bodies, resulting in greater exposure of the community to pollution. RD Bullard writes that a growing body of evidence reveals that people of color and low-income persons have borne greater environmental and health risks than the society at large in their neighbourhoods, workplaces and playgrounds.\n\nEnvironmental racism stems from the environmental movement of the 1960s and 1970s, which focused on environmental reform and wildlife preservation and protection, and was led primarily by the middle class. The early environmental movement largely ignored the plight of poor people and people of color who, even in the mid-20th century, were increasingly exposed to environmental hazards.\n\nPolicies related to redlining and urban decay can also acts as a form of environmental racism, and in turn affect public health. Urban minority communities may face environmental racism in the form of parks that are smaller, less accessible and of poorer quality than those in more affluent or white areas in some cities. This may have an indirect affect health since young people have fewer places to play and adults have fewer opportunities for exercise.\n\nAlthough impoverished or underdeveloped communities are at greater risk of contracting illnesses from public areas and disposal sites, they are also less likely to be located near a distinguished hospital or treatment center. Hospitals relocate to wealthier areas where the majority of patients are privately insured, thus reducing the number of low-income patients. Whereas hospitals were previously established in the areas with the greatest need, most are now focused on economic gain from private insurance companies, and are threatened by Medicare funding cuts.\n\nRobert Wallace writes that the pattern of the AIDS outbreak during the 80s was affected by the outcomes of a program of 'planned shrinkage' directed in African-American and Hispanic communities, and implemented through systematic denial of municipal services, particularly fire extinguishment resources, essential for maintaining urban levels of population density and ensuring community stability. Institutionalized racism affects general health care as well as the quality of AIDS health intervention and services in minority communities. The overrepresentation of minorities in various disease categories, including AIDS, is partially related to environmental racism. The national response to the AIDS epidemic in minority communities was slow during the 80s and 90s showing an insensitivity to ethnic diversity in prevention efforts and AIDS health services.\n\nA major downfall of the U.S. healthcare system is the unconscious racial biases held by many white American doctors, often resulting in decreased quality of care for African American patients. One such example is the discrepancy in cardiovascular surgical procedures between white and black patients. Compared to their white counterparts, black patients are less likely to receive necessary coronary bypass surgeries and lipid-lowering medications upon discharge from the hospital. This means that black patients leave treatment centers with a significantly different health outcome.\n\nOne potential cause of this discrepancy in treatment is the systematic racism present in the medical field that targets the work of African American scientists. Research shows that doctors and scientists of color are significantly underfunded in the medical community, and are less likely than their white colleagues to win research awards from the National Institute of Health (NIH). Since patients of color are often treated by white doctors, miscommunication is common; research shows that many Americans feel their doctors do not listen to their questions or concerns, or are too uncomfortable to ask certain medical questions.\n\nSome researchers suggest that racial segregation may lead to disparities in health and mortality. Thomas LaVeis (1989; 1993) tested the hypothesis that segregation would aid in explaining race differences in infant mortality rates across cities. Analyzing 176 large and midsized cities, LaVeist found support for the hypothesis. Since LaVeist's studies, segregation has received increased attention as a determinant of race disparities in mortality. Studies have shown that mortality rates for male and female African Americans are lower in areas with lower levels of residential segregation. Mortality for male and female European Americans was not associated in either direction with residential segregation.\n\nIn a study by Sharon A. Jackson, Roger T. Anderson, Norman J. Johnson and Paul D. Sorlie the researchers found that, after adjustment for family income, mortality risk increased with increasing minority residential segregation among Blacks aged 25 to 44 years and non-Blacks aged 45 to 64 years. In most age/race/gender groups, the highest and lowest mortality risks occurred in the highest and lowest categories of residential segregation, respectively. These results suggest that minority residential segregation may influence mortality risk and underscore the traditional emphasis on the social underpinnings of disease and death.\n\nRates of heart disease among African Americans are associated with the segregation patterns in the neighborhoods where they live (Fang \"et al.\" 1998). Stephanie A. Bond Huie writes that neighborhoods affect health and mortality outcomes primarily in an indirect fashion through environmental factors such as smoking, diet, exercise, stress, and access to health insurance and medical providers. Moreover, segregation strongly influences premature mortality in the US.\n\nMany healthcare professionals have experienced hate and racist remarks towards them at work. Whether it be at a hospital, a walk-in clinic, or a family doctor's office, people are hit with bias based comments concerning \"general bias, ethnicity / national origin, race, age, gender, accent, religion, political views, weight, medical education from outside the US, sexual orientation, and more\". This study conducted by WebMD and Medscape features the races of \"African American/Black, Asian, Caucasian, and Hispanic\" Training for doctors to handle this type of prejudice at their work is very low.\n\nHomicide plays a significant role in the racial gap in life expectancy. In 2008, homicide accounted for 19% of the gap among black men, though it did not play a significant role in the decline in the gap from 2003 to 2008. A report from the U.S. Department of Justice states \"In 2005, homicide victimization rates for blacks were 6 times higher than the rates for whites\" and \"94% of black victims were killed by blacks.\" Research by Robert J. Sampson indicates that the high degree of residential segregation in African American neighborhoods is responsible for the high homicide rate among African Americans.\n\nBased on data for 1945 to 1999, forecasts for relative black:white age-adjusted, all-cause mortality and white:black life expectancy at birth showed trends toward increasing disparities. From 1980 to 1998, average numbers of excess deaths per day among American blacks relative to whites increased by 20%. David Williams writes that higher disease rates for blacks (or African Americans) compared to whites are pervasive and persistent over time, with the racial gap in mortality widening in recent years for multiple causes of death.\n\nThe study of a genetic basis for racial health disparity in the United States is criticised for the use of a \"melting pot\" perspective and for neglecting to include indigenous North Americans. This is based on studies suggesting the genetic difference between \"races\" is greatest with populations that have been reproductively isolated for long periods of time. The United States is the opposite of this with a wide variety of cultures in close proximity along with a decreasing social stigma against interracial relationships.\n\nThis issue is illustrated with the example of those who identify themselves as Hispanic/Latino, typically a mix of Caucasian, Native American and African ancestry. Some studies include this as a \"race\", whereas others do not have that option and force members of this group to choose between identifying themselves as \"Caucasian\", \"Other\" or whatever group that individual identifies with. Such admixture of genetic ancestry would lend results more to cultural, environmental and socio-economic explanations of health disparity rather than a genetic explanation.\n\n"}

In the 1940s Barker and his associate Herbert Wright from the University of Kansas in Lawrence set up the Midwest Psychological Field Station in the nearby town of Oskaloosa, Kansas, a town of fewer than 2000 people. Barker's team gathered empirical data in Oskaloosa from 1947 through 1972, consistently disguising the town as 'Midwest, Kansas' for publications like \"One Boy's Day\" (1952) and \"Midwest and Its Children\" (1955). Based on this data, Barker first developed the concept of the behavior setting to help explain the interplay between the individual and the immediate environment.\n\nPossibly one of the most valuable developments of Barker's work was the examination of the way in which the number and variety of behavior settings remains remarkably constant even as institutions increased in size. This was explored in his seminal work with Paul Gump published as Barker, R. and Gump, P. (1964) \"Big School Small School\", Stanford: Stanford University Press. They showed that large schools had a similar number of behavior settings to small schools. A consequence of this was that students could take many different roles in small schools (e.g. be in the school band and the school football team), while in larger schools there was a greater tendency to be selective.\n\nBarker died at his home in Oskaloosa, Kansas in September 1990. He was survived by his wife, Louise Shedd Barker, with whom he collaborated on much of his research.\n\nBarker is the subject of a 2014 biography — \"The Outsider: The Life and Times of Roger Barker\" — by award-winning American journalist Ariel Sabar.\n\n"}
{"id": "170734", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=170734", "title": "Smegma", "text": "Smegma\n\nSmegma (Greek \"smēgma\") is a combination of shed skin cells, skin oils, and moisture. It occurs in both male and female mammalian genitalia. In female bodies, it collects around the clitoris and in the folds of the labia minora; in males, smegma collects under the foreskin.\n\nThe accumulation of sebum combined with dead skin cells forms smegma. Smegma clitoridis is defined as the secretion of the apocrine glands of the clitoris, in combination with desquamating epithelial cells. Glands that are located around the clitoris and the vulva majoris secrete sebum. If smegma is not removed frequently it can lead to clitoral adhesion which can make clitoral stimulation (such as masturbation) painful (clitorodynia).\n\nIn males, smegma helps keep the glans moist and facilitates sexual intercourse by acting as a lubricant. Smegma is \"completely benign.\"\n\nSmegma was originally thought to be produced by sebaceous glands near the frenulum called Tyson's glands; however, subsequent studies have failed to find these glands. Wright states that smegma is produced from minute microscopic protrusions of the mucosal surface of the foreskin and that living cells constantly grow towards the surface, undergo fatty degeneration, separate off, and form smegma. Parkash \"et al.\" found that smegma contains 26.6% fats and 13.3% proteins, which they judged to be consistent with necrotic epithelial debris. Newly produced smegma has a smooth, moist texture. It is thought to be rich in squalene and contain prostatic and seminal secretions, desquamated epithelial cells, and the mucin content of the urethral glands of Littré. Smegma contains Cathepsin B, lysozymes, chymotrypsin, neutrophil elastase and cytokines, which aid the immune system.\n\nAccording to Wright, little smegma is produced during childhood, although the foreskin may contain sebaceous glands. She also says that production of smegma increases from adolescence until sexual maturity when the function of smegma for lubrication assumes its full value, and from middle-age production starts to decline and in old age virtually no smegma is produced. Øster reported that the incidence of smegma increased from 1% among 6- to 7-year-olds and 8- to 9-year-olds to 8% among 14- to 15-year-olds and 16- to 17-year-olds (an overall incidence of 5%).\n\nThere is no evidence that smegma causes penile cancer, but its presence over a long period of time may irritate and inflame the penis, which may increase the risk of cancer. It may also make it harder to see very early cancers.\n\nIn healthy animals, smegma helps clean and lubricate the genitals. In veterinary medicine, analysis of this smegma is sometimes used for detection of urogenital tract pathogens, such as \"Tritrichomonas foetus\". Accumulation of smegma in the equine preputial folds and the urethral fossa and urethral diverticulum can form large \"beans\" and promote the carriage of \"Taylorella equigenitalis\", the causative agent of contagious equine metritis. Some equine veterinarians have recommended periodic cleaning of male genitals to improve the health of the animal.\n\n"}
{"id": "3969853", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=3969853", "title": "Standard operating procedure", "text": "Standard operating procedure\n\nA standard operating procedure (SOP) is a set of step-by-step instructions compiled by an organization to help workers carry out complex routine operations. SOPs aim to achieve efficiency, quality output and uniformity of performance, while reducing miscommunication and failure to comply with industry regulations.\n\nThe military (e.g. in the U.S. and UK) sometimes uses the term standing (rather than \"standard\") operating procedure because a military SOP refers to a unit's unique procedures, which are not necessarily standard to another unit. The word \"standard\" can imply that only one (standard) procedure is to be used across all units.\n\nIn clinical research, the \"International Council for Harmonisation\" (ICH) defines SOPs as \"detailed, written instructions to achieve uniformity of the performance of a specific function\". SOPs usually get applied in pharmaceutical processing and for related clinical studies. There the focus is always set on repeated application of unchanged processes and procedures and its documentation, hence supporting the segregation of origins, causes and effects. Further application is with triage, when limited resources get used according to an assessment on ranking, urgence and staffing possibilities. Study director is mainly responsible for SOPs. The Quality Assurance Unit are individuals who are responsible for monitoring whether the study report and tests are meeting the SOP. \nSOPs can also provide employees with a reference to common business practices, activities, or tasks. New employees use a SOP to answer questions without having to interrupt supervisors to ask how an operation is performed. The international quality standard ISO 9001 essentially requires the determination of processes (documented as standard operating procedures) used in any manufacturing process that could affect the quality of the product.\n\nProcedures are extensively employed to assist with working safely. They are sometimes called safe work methods statements (SWMS, pronounced as 'Swims'). They are usually preceded by various methods of analyzing tasks or jobs to be performed in a workplace, including an approach called job safety analysis, in which hazards are identified and their control methods described. Procedures must be suited to the literacy levels of the user, and as part of this, the readability of procedures is important.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "679909", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=679909", "title": "Stephen Franklin (Babylon 5)", "text": "Stephen Franklin (Babylon 5)\n\nStephen Franklin is a lead character in the fictional universe of the science fiction television series \"Babylon 5\", played by Richard Biggs. He serves as the chief medical officer on the Babylon 5 space station.\n\nDr. Franklin is a strong-willed, kind person and idealistic leader on Babylon 5; he is also a workaholic. He is not afraid to take risks to save a patient's life; this habit can occasionally get him into trouble. He has strong moral and ethical values, but he can also be self-righteous and a perfectionist at times. He apparently has a good relationship with his mother and siblings, although his long absences from Earth often lead them to complain that they rarely see him. His father - a famous general in EarthForce- has a domineering personality, and that has led Stephen to have a strained relationship with him. When they are together they frequently argue and they have conflicting views on a number of subjects. For example, Stephen's father is suspicious of aliens and believes that humans should \"take care of their own\", while Stephen believes that humanity should be more open to relations with alien races and civilizations. However, in many ways Stephen and his father are more alike than they will admit, and in the series second season they meet and begin to ease their differences. In terms of love and romance throughout the course of the series he has a number of love affairs with various women. His most prominent and long-lasting affair is with \"Number One,\" the attractive and tough-minded leader of the Mars Resistance.\n\nWhile the character was explicitly described as black in the script of the episode Soul Hunter, his first appearance on the show, J. Michael Straczynski was adamant throughout the run of the series that Franklin be a true individual who could have been played by an actor of any race. Richard Biggs later expressed his gratitude at being able to play a role purely as an actor, not a black actor.\n\nFollowing in the footsteps of his father, General Richard Franklin, Franklin joined EarthForce in 2232 to become a physician. Shortly after graduating from medical school, he left EarthForce and spent the next three years \"hitchhiking\" aboard starships, trading his services as doctor for free passage to their destinations. In the course of his work, Franklin took detailed notes on the biology, physiology, and culture of many alien species. In his travels, he encountered a group of Minbari whose transport ship had crashed at Beta Durani. The Minbari were severely injured in the accident, and due to Franklin's lack of knowledge of Minbari biology, they all died. Franklin performed an autopsy on one of the Minbari, and gathered notes on their biology and genetics.\n\nWhen the Earth-Minbari War started in 2243, Franklin rejoined EarthForce and was assigned to manage an advanced military hospital on Earth. During the war, all EarthForce doctors were ordered to turn over any notes they had on Minbari biology for use in the production of biological weapons. When EarthForce discovered that Dr. Franklin had detailed notes on Minbari anatomy and physiology, he was ordered to give his notes to EarthForce researchers. Franklin, believing that it was unethical for a doctor to aid in research to create weapons of mass destruction, refused, and he was arrested by EarthForce.\n\nFranklin was released from prison shortly afterward to accompany Lieutenant Commander John Sheridan on a mission to the Epsilon solar system as part of an advance team to negotiate peace with the Minbari. They were ferried to the Epsilon system by a Narn warcruiser. The meeting with the Minbari was ended, however, by a sneak attack by the Centauri. They thought the meeting was for a weapons-shipment deal between the humans and the Narns. The Minbari delegate to the meeting was killed in the Centauri attack. Both Franklin and Sheridan (along with the Narn G'Kar), were captured by the Minbari. However, the Minbari surprisingly released them when Sheridan uttered a Minbari phrase that the Minbari delegate had told him before he died. After his release, Franklin returned to Earth; his activities for the remainder of the Earth-Minbari War are unknown.\nBetween this event and 2258, he met Jeffrey Sinclair, the future Commander of the Babylon 5 station. It was largely on Sinclair's recommendation that Franklin was named the chief medical officer on Babylon 5.\n\nIn 2258, he was assigned to the Babylon 5 station as chief surgeon after the recall of Dr. Benjamin Kyle to Earth. He stayed there for four years.\n\nFranklin had strong moral convictions, and this was evident numerous times during his tenure at Babylon 5. Sometimes, his convictions conflicted with his duties as an EarthForce officer. These transgressions included the illegal operation of a free health clinic in Down Below, a part of the station where the poorest members of many alien races lived. He also insisted on performing a life-saving operation on an alien child against the parents' wishes; under the alien's religion any surgery was a violation of their religious beliefs. Franklin was devastated when the parents, acting according to their religion, killed their own child after the successful surgery. Dr. Franklin was also a leading participant in an \"underground railroad\" that helped rogue telepaths who had refused to join PsiCorps make their way to freedom; the telepaths were trying to escape from the ruthless Psi Cops. He was also a Foundationist, a new religion on Earth which incorporated the basic beliefs of many older human religions into a single faith. Foundationism (not to be confused with the school of philosophy called foundationalism), is a fictional religion invented by J. Michael Straczynski for his science fiction television show, \"Babylon 5\". Foundationism appeared on Earth around the year 2157 in response to contact with other intelligent species in the universe. Dr. Franklin explains that \"the idea behind the Foundation is that to get back to the roots of all the Earth religions, get past the doctrines to the core of each belief system to find out what they have in common. And they've got a lot more in common than you think. It's just when politics and money and nationalism get in the way that things get a little messed up.\" He also explains that Foundationists believe that \"The closer you get to defining God, the further away it gets.\" \n\nAs with many characters on Babylon 5, Franklin's personality contained the seeds of his own weaknesses. In his case, Franklin's passionate interest in saving lives and meeting a very high personal standard led to his use of stimulants (\"stims\") as shown starting in the third season episode, \"A Day in the Strife\". Stims were a powerful but dangerous drug, and Franklin admitted his addiction obliquely to Delenn in \"Ceremonies of Light and Dark\", and finally was forced by Garibaldi to confront this addiction in \"Interludes and Examinations\". After he admitted his addiction, Franklin resigned as Babylon 5's medical chief and embarked on a walkabout of the space station (in the episode of the same name). The term \"walkabout\" comes from the aborigines in Australia; Franklin had learned of the practice from his Foundationist religious beliefs.\n\nIn a later episode Franklin finally realized that he had run away from problems his entire life, and that he was doing so again. He finally confronted his problem, and although while on his \"walkabout\" he was nearly killed, he returned to medlab a stronger and wiser person for the experience.\n\nAlthough he spent most of the series in medlab saving lives, Franklin also saw his share of action and adventure during the series. He was an active participant in the Earth Alliance Civil War, where he aided the Mars Resistance in its fight to free the Mars colony from Earth control. During the war between the Centauri Republic and the Interstellar Alliance he also worked with the telepath Lyta Alexander in investigating reports of Drazi atrocities against the Centauri on the Drazi homeworld; both Franklin and Lyta were nearly killed during the investigation.\n\nIn 2262, during the series fifth and final season, Franklin resigned from his post at Babylon 5 to accept the position of \"Head of Xenobiological Research\" on Earth upon the retirement of Dr. Benjamin Kyle. At the beginning of 2263, he selected Dr. Lillian Hobbes as his replacement on Babylon 5. Franklin later conducted research in the attempt to fight the plague the Drakh inflicted on Earth. He is seen in the Crusade episode \"Each Night I Dream of Home.\"\n\nAt the end of the series, Franklin was still the head of Xenobiological research on Earth. When Sheridan learned he was dying, Franklin went to Minbar for one last party. From there, Franklin traveled to Babylon 5, where he witnessed the station's decommissioning and destruction. J. Michael Straczynski has said that Franklin eventually dies while exploring an unknown planet, but has not revealed the details of exactly how or when he dies.\n\nAs Richard Biggs died in May 2004, the Franklin character will not make any further appearances in any future Babylon 5 movies or television series. When Biggs died, Straczynski had been working on a Babylon 5 script titled \"The Memory of Shadows\". Straczynski decided not to recast the Franklin character, and rewrote the script to remove him from the story. In the \"\" anthology, it is explained that both Franklin and G'Kar - played by Andreas Katsulas who died in February 2006 - had left to explore space beyond the 'galactic rim'.\n"}

In 1997, Florida settled a large lawsuit with a large tobacco industry and was granted $11.3 billion to assist with Medicaid costs incurred by health care services for smokers. As a result of the lawsuit, the Tobacco Pilot Program was launched by the Florida Department of Health to help educate the youth on the impacts of tobacco use. When Florida's legislation decided to reduce funding to $1 million annually five years later after the Tobacco Pilot Program was launched, Floridians passed a constitutional amendment in 2006, which requires an annual appropriation of 15% of the gross 2005 tobacco settlement fund (adjusted for inflation) to provide money for a statewide tobacco education and prevention program.\n\nIn 2007, the Zimmerman Agency was awarded $17.1 million contract to conduct a statewide social marketing, media, and public relations campaign. The Tobacco Free Florida brand was created as the department's health communication intervention component. The Tobacco Free Florida Campaign helps thousands of Floridians quit using smoke and smokeless tobacco products through the use of TV, radio, print and social media. It operates on a budget of about $65 million per year.\n\nThe campaign started in 2008 was created to discourage the use of tobacco among all Floridians but with a specific emphasis on youth ages 11–17, adults ages 18–24, chronic disease sufferers, pregnant women, low-income households, parents and small businesses. Using English, Spanish and Haitian Creole media executions, the campaign is able to target all audiences through various communication channels. The Tobacco Free Florida and Quitline commercials have become famous through the years of their existence. Tobacco Free Florida chooses to create existing high-impact spots with \"messages that elicit strong emotions response, such as personal testimonials and strong viscerally negative content.\" For example, a commercial that showed a brain cut in half to show the clot that has formed due to cigarette smoke. Billboards and posters are used to display images of unhealthy lungs, millions of cigarette buds collected and alarming statistics regarding tobacco use.\n\nAlong with radio, commercial and social media Tobacco Free Florida has several ground work initiatives, including Smokifier Vans that travel the state visiting festivals, sporting events, and co-branded partners (YMCA and Walmart). The vans have age-progression software photo booths that ages visitors as smokers and nonsmokers allowing Floridians to experience the physical effects of smoking.\n\nTobacco Free Florida has successfully established partnerships with all of the following sports organizations:\n\nIn 2010, Tobacco Free Florida purchased a package of ads for $447,992.50 to be run multiple times before, during and after the Super Bowl Game. The ads were created with a smoking cessation message intended to target adult smokers. A focus group was run on people who had seen the commercials and concluded that people did not care that they were at an increased risk of dying from cancer or heart disease but they did care that every year smoking leaves 31,000 children fatherless. The overall impact of the ad was to target adult smokers to think about their tobacco use affecting their children and family.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "15906519", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=15906519", "title": "Water supply and sanitation in Rwanda", "text": "Water supply and sanitation in Rwanda\n\nWater supply and sanitation in Rwanda is characterized by a clear government policy and significant donor support. In response to poor sustainability of rural water systems and poor service quality, in 2002 local government in the Northern Byumba Province contracted out service provision to the local private sector in a form of public-private partnership. Support for public-private partnerships became a government policy in 2004 and locally initiated public-private partnerships spread rapidly, covering 25% of rural water systems as of 2007.\n\nIn urban areas, the Water and Sanitation Corporation (WASAC) is in charge of water supply. In March 2015, the government signed a 27-year contract with a private company to invest $75 million in order to provide 40,000 cubic meters/day of bulk water from a wellfield next to the Nyabarongo River to the capital Kigali. It is the first contract of this type in Sub-Saharan Africa.\n\nFigures on access to water and sanitation vary depending on the source of information, apparently in part because different definitions may have been used for access to an Improved water source and Improved sanitation. The fact that many rural water systems are not functioning properly makes it also difficult to estimate effective access to improved water supply.\n\nThe following table compares access to water supply according to various sources, highlighting the difficulty to obtain reliable data on the change in access to water supply because of different definitions used. The data appear to indicate that access decreased over time, while in the same period significant investments were undertaken in rural water supply. The government's 2002 Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper acknowledges that indeed \"sustained access to potable water sources has probably declined in rural areas\" since 1995. A main reason is poor maintenance and insufficient cost recovery, leading to the breakdown of systems, in particular those relying on pumping.\n\nTable: Access to an improved source of water supply according to various sources\n\nAccording to both the 2000 Multi-Indicator Survey and the 2000 Demographic and Health Survey, access to an improved source of water supply was 91% in urban areas and 67% in rural areas. According to the same source, access to adequate sanitation was 54% in urban areas and 37% in rural areas.\n\nAccording to calculations based on data from the 2002 census, access to an improved source of water supply was 80% in urban areas and 67% in rural areas, including in the definition of improved source house connections, yard connections, public standposts, protected wells and protected springs. If figures were comparable, this would indicate a decline in access in urban areas and a stagnation in rural areas. The following map shows access to an improved source of water supply by districts and towns according to the 2002 census: Map of access to an improved source of water supply\n\nAccording to the 2005 Integral Household Living Conditions Survey, however, 66% of the urban population and 57% of the rural population had access to an improved source of drinking water. With respect to adequate sanitation, access was estimated at only 10% in urban areas and 8% in rural areas.)\nIf the figures were comparable, this would imply a massive decrease in access to water and sanitation in both urban and rural areas over the preceding five years.\n\nHowever, according to a World Bank report, access to rural water supply in Rwanda increased from 41% in 2001 to 55% in 2005. The 2005 figure thus is roughly in line with the figures of the 2005 Integral Household Living Conditions Survey. According to the government, access to water supply in rural areas increased significantly in only two years from 57% in 2005 to 71% in 2007.\n\nAccording to the 2008 Demographic and Health Survey 60% of the population had access to an improved water source, broken down by 73% in urban areas and 57% in rural areas. The JMP estimates based on one national survey conducted in 1992 and 12 national surveys conducted between 1998 and 2008 that access to an improved water source declined from 66% in 1995 to 65% in 2010. The decline was most marked in urban areas – from 91% to 76%.\n\nThe Joint Monitoring Programme for Water Supply and Sanitation of WHO and UNICEF estimated access to an improved water source in Uganda in 2011 at 71% and access to improved sanitation at 64%.\n\nLack of access to water supply and sanitation has significant health impacts. In addition, it imposes a significant burden on women and girls who have to carry water. For instance, more than one in five households in Umutara is more than an hour away from its water source. This has implications for the quality of women's and girls' lives, their economic productivity and their access to education. Even where people statistically do have access to an improved water source such as a communal borehole that in some cases is shared by up to 175 families, they sometimes have to wait for more than four hours before they can get water.\n\nWater infrastructure in Rwanda consisted of 15 urban and about 796 rural water systems in 2002. Urban water systems are fed by water from 17 water treatment plants. Rural water systems feed mostly standpipes. Handpumps using groundwater and managed springs provide water separately from water systems.\n\nSome rural water systems are large and complex. For example, in 2001 there were 50 water systems that spanned more than one district and 10 water systems that spanned more than one province. The largest one serves 120,000 users in villages several miles apart. Although these systems are \"piped,\" this typically means that water is distributed to water points in the village where users must go to retrieve water.\n\nWater Infrastructure\n\nSource: Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper 2002, p. 51 and p. 25, quoting the 2001 inventory of rural water supply systems\n\nDespite favorable rainfall, little use is made of rainwater harvesting, except by a few health centers and churches.\n\nConcerning sanitation, only about 15% of urban wastewater is collected through sewers. As far as sanitation in institutions is concerned, only 20% of primary schools in both rural and urban areas have latrines. The situation in secondary schools, prisons, health centers and markets is also poor.\n\nAbout half of rural water schemes did not function in 2004 according to an extensive field survey.\n\nRwanda has abundant rainfall and water resources, totalling 5 billion cubic meters per year (177 billion cu ft/yr). However, deforestation and erosion affect the productivity of springs, which are the main source of water supply in rural areas.\n\nRwanda has 22,300 springs registered in a spring inventory. Total water use was estimated at 150 million cubic meters per year (5.3 billion cu ft/yr) in 2000, of which 24% (36 million m³/year or 1.27 billion cu ft/year) was for domestic uses, corresponding to only 4 cubic meters per capita per year or about 11 liters per capita per day (140 cu ft/capita/yr or about 3 U.S. gallons or 2½ imperial gallons/capita/day). Another source estimates total water use at 800 million cubic meters per year (28 billion cu ft/yr) in 1993, of which 5% (40 million m³/yr or 1.4 billion cu ft) were for domestic uses.\n\nFrom 1990–1993 the country was engulfed in a Civil War, followed by a massive Genocide in 1994. The government has set itself the target to achieve universal access to water supply and sanitation by 2018. As described below, the water sector followed a different development pattern in rural and urban areas.\n\nFrom 1950 to 1984 water in rural areas was provided free of charge to beneficiaries and infrastructure was owned by the national government. Beginning in 1984 the responsibility for rural service provision was transferred to communities. In 1987 a decree (Arrêté Présidentiel n°291/11 du 15 mai 1987) transferred ownership of rural water infrastructure to districts, well before the government enacted a comprehensive decentralization policy. Reconstruction activities after the 1994 genocide initially did not achieve a large increase in water supply and sanitation coverage, nor was there a sustainable management model for water systems in rural areas. Many users did not pay for water, some collected funds were mismanaged, and voluntary members of water committees in charge of operating and maintaining systems were often poorly motivated. As a result, about half of rural water schemes did not function in 2004 according to an extensive field survey. The adoption of a new sector policy based on a demand driven approach in 1997 did not change the situation much.\n\nIn 2000 the government began a process of decentralization, giving the country's 30 districts more revenues and decision-making authority. Districts, which were already nominally the owners of rural water infrastructure, now began to develop their capacity to plan and execute infrastructure projects. \nIn 2002 local government in the Northern Byumba Province, inspired by similar experiences in neighboring Uganda, contracted out service provision to the local private sector in a form of public-private partnership. Following that local experience, the government eventually abandoned its policy of community management and decided in 2004 to promote local public-private partnerships following the \"Byumba model\". With the backing up of the national government, districts thus competitively bid out and signed contracts with private service providers throughout the country. In 2007, 140 rural piped water systems (25% of the total) were managed through public-private partnerships. Investments in rural water supply increased substantially since 2002, leading to an increase in access to water supply in rural areas from 57% in 2005 to 71% in 2007 according to government figures.\n\nWASAC is a company that distributes water in Rwanda. As a national utility, the company has been in existence since 1976, as ELECTROGAZ. In 1939 the water, electricity and gas utility \"REGIDESO\" was established to supply water, electricity and gas to Rwanda-Urundi with its seat in Bujumbura. The company was later divided into REGIDESO Rwanda and REGIDESO Burundi in 1963. In 1976, REGIDESO Rwanda became the state-owned monopoly ELECTROGAZ. \nIn 2003 the government signed a management contract with Lahmeyer International to manage and restructure ELECTROGAZ in collaboration with Hamburg Water Works for 5 years. In March 2006, the management contract was terminated and management of the company reverted to the Government of Rwanda. In 2009 Rwanda Water and Sanitation Corporation (RWASCO) was created, institutionally separating water supply and energy. However, only one year later it was absorbed into the Rwandan Energy Water and Sanitation Authority (EWSA). In 2008, RWASCO had signed a three-year agreement with the National Water and Sewerage Corporation (NWSC) of Uganda for performance improvement and to promote commercial service delivery. In 2014 the urban water sector was again separated from the energy sector, creating a water and sanitation utility, now called WASAC.\n\nThe Ministry of Lands, Environment, Forests, Water and Mines (Ministère des Terres, de l'Environnement, des Forêts, de l'Eau et des Mines – Miniter), through its water and sanitation directorate (Direction de l'eau et de l'assainissement), is in charge of determining water policies and strategies in Rwanda. It is also in charge of monitoring drinking water quality and promoting user awareness.\n\nThe Ministry of Infrastructure (Mininfra) is supporting districts in the construction of water supply systems, latrines and hygiene promotion with the support of UNICEF.\n\nThe Ministry of Local Government, Good Governance, Rural Development and Social Affairs (Minaloc) is in charge of accompanying local participatory planning processes, appying the government's Community Development Policy. Actual planning is carried out by Rwanda's 30 districts through District Development Plans which are elaborated using a participatory approach. The districts also own the water infrastructure.\n\nThe regulatory agency Rwanda Utilities Regulatory Agency (RURA), created by law in 2001, is responsible for the economic regulation of the telecommunications, electricity, water, sanitation, gas and transportation sectors. Its mission is to:\n\n\nThe purpose of the agency's water and sanitation department is to:\n\n\nIn practice, according to the agency's annual reports up to 2004, it seems that the regulatory agency focused much of its activities in the water and sanitation sector on the supervision of the management contract for Electrogaz (now EWSA).\n\nUrban areas. The Water and Sanitation Corporation (WASAC) is in charge of urban water supply and sanitation in Rwanda. Its predecessor EWSA had more than 118,000 water customers in 2013, up from only 38,500 in 2005.\n\nRural areas. There are 847 piped rural water systems in Rwanda and 19,300 protected springs. Most of the piped water systems are pumped systems, as opposed to gravity systems, since in Rwanda many settlements are at higher altitude than the water sources serving them. Many systems serve a large number of villages: The largest ones serve up to 120,000 people living in villages dozens of kilometers apart. Almost all users are served through water sales points where water is sold or given away for free by the bucket. House connections are rare in rural areas.\n\nServices in rural areas are provided by community-based organizations (about 650 systems), by private operators under contract with district governments (about 140 systems) and privately owned systems (about 60), most of which were privately owned since at least 2000.\n\nRural areas. Water tariffs in rural areas are usually measured by jerrycan (bucket) for water sold at water kiosks or public standposts. In rural water systems managed by private operators in 2004 the water tariffs per jerrycan of 20 liters varied between 14 and 25 Rwandan Franc (RWF), equivalent to about 2.5 to 4.5 US cents per gerrycan or US$1.25 – 2.25 per cubic meter, according to the Utilities Regulatory Agency.\n\nHowever, according to a World Bank report of 2008 tariffs range from only RWF 2.5 (gravity-fed systems) to RWF 15 (pumping systems) per jerrycan (equivalent to US$0.25 to US$1.40/m3). In addition, and to alleviate the financial burden for the poorest part of\nthe rural population, the districts keep a list of vulnerable households (widows, poor\nsingle-parent households), who get free access to water points. These lists are drawn up by communities and approved by local authorities.\n\nAccording to the World Bank, \"the principle of paying water at standposts in accordance with the volume consumed has been widely accepted, as the water users acknowledged the improvements in service delivery. More than fifteen years of experience with administrative or community management of water services proved that free or unpaid water resulted in little water or no water at all.\"\n\nFor the few house connections the volumetric tariff is set at between RWF622 and RWF850 per m3 (US$1.13 and 1.55 per m3) according to the regulatory agency and at RWF185 to RWF600 per m3 according to the World Bank.\n\nUrban areas. As of June 2013 the urban water tariff was RWF240 per m3 for the first five cubic meters per month and RWF300 per m3 for any consumption between 6 and 20 m3 per month. Higher tariffs are charged for higher consumption. Water at public kiosks is sold at RWF240 per m3.\n\nCost recovery in rural water schemes has apparently improved in those schemes that are run as public-private partnerships, despite the fact that some poor users receive water for free. Private operators also pay a monthly rent to the districts for the right to use the systems, which remain publicly owned.\n\nLevel and composition. Investments in rural water supply and sanitation increased from US$3.5 million in 2002 to US$32 million in 2006.\n\nMechanism. Investments are channeled from donors and the national government to districts and communities through a Community Development Fund (CDF) established in 2001. 10% of tax revenues are allocated to the CDF by law, although actual transfers remained short of this target in 2003. In that year, 4 bn Rwandan Francs (RWF) were approved, but only 1 bn RWF were disbursed. The 30 Districts of Rwanda sign annual performance contracts with the President of the Republic about the construction of water facilities and the protection of catchment areas. A commission assesses progress on a quarterly basis.\n\nA large share of investments is financed by donors, including by the World Bank. Communities contribute to the initial capital costs. In 2009 the World Bank's Water and Sanitation Program and the government of Rwanda completed a study of Rwanda's funding mechanisms for water and sanitation which found that \"existing financing modalities are highly fragmented and not appropriate for consistent financing of an ambitious water sector program\". A new financing option recommended by the study was awaiting government approval in October 2009. It proposes a pooled Water and Sanitation Fund that would handle both government and donor contributions through the same national procedures. Districts would submit projects based on their regular planning procedures while a unit managing the Fund would appraise and monitor the projects. The Fund would be established under a new water supply and sanitation authority.\n\nDonors in the Rwandan rural water sector follow a unified implementation framework which is based on the government's national strategy and program and medium-term expenditure framework. According to the Rwandan Development Gateway, in 2005 Rwanda's \"achievements in establishing an aid coordination, harmonization, and alignment framework are being recognized as international best-practice.\" This is significant progress compared to the observation in the government's 2002 Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper, which had observed \"a piecemeal and uncoordinated approach\" among donors in the sector and had called for a sector-wide approach.\n\nThe World Bank supported rural water supply and sanitation through a series of projects, including the US$72.3 million water supply 02 project (1987–1998) and the US$20 million Rural Water and Sanitation Project (2000–2007). The latter has provided 352,000 people with access to improved water services by December 2006. At the same time more than 12 percent of the 830 water-piped systems existing in the country were privately managed. The World Bank rated the project highly satisfactory in its 2008 completion report.\n\nIn 2005 the European Union (EU) signed a contract with the Rwandan government for a major water project in the Bugesera Region (Kigali rural) worth 16 billion Rwandan francs (Euro 23.24 million). The water project will benefit the four districts of Kanzenze, Gashora, Bicumbi and Kanombe in the eastern part of Kigali city.\n\nThe African Development Bank has recently committed US$12 million to rural water supply and sanitation. The British and Belgian governments also support water supply and sanitation projects in Rwanda.\n\nIn 2009 the Government of the Netherlands has committed US$22 million for a Water for Sanitation and Hygiene (WASH) project to be implemented by UNICEF. The aim of the project is to increase the provision of water services and of sanitation facilities as well as to spread good hygiene practices. The project is implemented by four districts in the Northern Province with the support of the Ministry of Infrastructure. An evaluation of a previous US$5 million UNICEF project for Water and Environmental Sanitation (WES) implemented from 1997 to 2000 concluded that its goals had been too ambitious and its hygiene and environmental sanitation component yielded little impact. However, in the 66 municipalities were the project intervened it increased access to water supply and succeeded in strengthening community capacity for managing water systems.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "514458", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=514458", "title": "Wound healing", "text": "Wound healing\n\nWound healing is a complex process in which the skin, and the tissues under it, repair themselves after injury. In this article, wound healing is depicted in a discrete timeline of physical attributes (phases) constituting the post-trauma repairing process. In undamaged skin, the epidermis (surface layer) and dermis (deeper layer) form a protective barrier against the external environment. When the barrier is broken, a regulated sequence of biochemical events is set into motion to repair the damage. This process is divided into predictable phases: blood clotting (hemostasis), inflammation, tissue growth (proliferation), and tissue remodeling (maturation). Blood clotting may be considered to be part of the inflammation stage instead of a separate stage. \n\nThe wound healing process is not only complex but also fragile, and it is susceptible to interruption or failure leading to the formation of non-healing chronic wounds. Factors that contribute to non-healing chronic wounds are diabetes, venous or arterial disease, infection, and metabolic deficiencies of old age.\n\nWound care encourages and speeds wound healing via cleaning and protection from reinjury or infection. Depending on each patient's needs, it can range from the simplest first aid to entire nursing specialties such as wound, ostomy, and continence nursing and burn center care.\n\n\nTiming is important to wound healing. Critically, the timing of wound reepithelialization can decide the outcome of the healing. If the epithelization of tissue over a denuded area is slow, a scar will form over many weeks, or months; If the epithelization of a wounded area is fast, the healing will result in regeneration.\n\nWound healing is classically divided into hemostasis, inflammation, proliferation, and remodeling. Although a useful construct, this model employs considerable overlapping among individual phases. A complementary model has recently been described where the many elements of wound healing are more clearly delineated. The importance of this new model becomes more apparent through its utility in the fields of regenerative medicine and tissue engineering (see Research and development section below). In this construct, the process of wound healing is divided into two major phases: the \"early phase\" and the \"cellular phase\":\n\nThe early phase, which begins immediately following skin injury, involves cascading molecular and cellular events leading to hemostasis and formation of an early, makeshift extracellular matrix that provides structural staging for cellular attachment and subsequent cellular proliferation.\n\nThe cellular phase involves several types of cells working together to mount an inflammatory response, synthesize granulation tissue, and restore the epithelial layer. Subdivisions of the cellular phase are: [1] Macrophages and inflammatory components (within 1–2 days), [2] Epithelial-mesenchymal interaction: re-epithelialization (phenotype change within hours, migration begins on day 1 or 2), [3] Fibroblasts and myofibroblasts: progressive alignment, collagen production, and matrix contraction (between day 4 and day 14), [4] Endothelial cells and angiogenesis (begins on day 4), [5] Dermal matrix: elements of fabrication (begins on day 4, lasting 2 weeks) and alteration/remodeling (begins after week 2, lasting weeks to months—depending on wound size).\n\nJust before the inflammatory phase is initiated, the clotting cascade occurs in order to achieve hemostasis, or stop blood loss by way of a fibrin clot. Thereafter, various soluble factors (including chemokines and cytokines) are released to attract cells that phagocytise debris, bacteria, and damaged tissue, in addition to releasing signaling molecules that initiate the proliferative phase of wound healing.\n\nWhen tissue is first wounded, blood comes in contact with collagen, triggering blood platelets to begin secreting inflammatory factors. Platelets also express sticky glycoproteins on their cell membranes that allow them to aggregate, forming a mass.\n\nFibrin and fibronectin cross-link together and form a plug that traps proteins and particles and prevents further blood loss. This fibrin-fibronectin plug is also the main structural support for the wound until collagen is deposited. Migratory cells use this plug as a matrix to crawl across, and platelets adhere to it and secrete factors. The clot is eventually lysed and replaced with granulation tissue and then later with collagen.\n\nPlatelets, the cells present in the highest numbers shortly after a wound occurs, release mediators into the blood, including cytokines and growth factors. Growth factors stimulate cells to speed their rate of division. Platelets release other proinflammatory factors like serotonin, bradykinin, prostaglandins, prostacyclins, thromboxane, and histamine, which serve several purposes, including increasing cell proliferation and migration to the area and causing blood vessels to become dilated and porous. In many ways, extravasated platelets in trauma perform a similar function to tissue macrophages and mast cells exposed to microbial molecular signatures in infection: they become activated, and secrete molecular mediators – vasoactive amines, eicosanoids, and cytokines – that initiate the inflammatory process.\n\nImmediately after a blood vessel is breached, ruptured cell membranes release inflammatory factors like thromboxanes and prostaglandins that cause the vessel to spasm to prevent blood loss and to collect inflammatory cells and factors in the area. This vasoconstriction lasts five to ten minutes and is followed by vasodilation, a widening of blood vessels, which peaks at about 20 minutes post-wounding. Vasodilation is the end result of factors released by platelets and other cells. The main factor involved in causing vasodilation is histamine. Histamine also causes blood vessels to become porous, allowing the tissue to become edematous because proteins from the bloodstream leak into the extravascular space, which increases its osmolar load and draws water into the area. Increased porosity of blood vessels also facilitates the entry of inflammatory cells like leukocytes into the wound site from the bloodstream.\n\nWithin an hour of wounding, polymorphonuclear neutrophils (PMNs) arrive at the wound site and become the predominant cells in the wound for the first two days after the injury occurs, with especially high numbers on the second day. They are attracted to the site by fibronectin, growth factors, and substances such as kinins. Neutrophils phagocytise debris and kill bacteria by releasing free radicals in what is called a 'respiratory burst. They also cleanse the wound by secreting proteases that break down damaged tissue. Functional neutrophils at the wound site only have life-spans of around 2 days, so they usually undergo apoptosis once they have completed their tasks and are engulfed and degraded by macrophages.\n\nOther leukocytes to enter the area include helper T cells, which secrete cytokines to cause more T cells to divide and to increase inflammation and enhance vasodilation and vessel permeability. T cells also increase the activity of macrophages.\n\nOne of the macrophage's roles is to phagocytize other expended phagocytes, bacteria and damaged tissue, and they also debride damaged tissue by releasing proteases.\n\nMacrophages function in regeneration and are essential for wound healing. They are stimulated by the low oxygen content of their surroundings to produce factors that induce and speed angiogenesis and they also stimulate cells that reepithelialize the wound, create granulation tissue, and lay down a new extracellular matrix. By secreting these factors, macrophages contribute to pushing the wound healing process into the next phase. They replace PMNs as the predominant cells in the wound by two days after injury.\n\nThe spleen contains half the body's monocytes in reserve ready to be deployed to injured tissue. Attracted to the wound site by growth factors released by platelets and other cells, monocytes from the bloodstream enter the area through blood vessel walls. Numbers of monocytes in the wound peak one to one and a half days after the injury occurs. Once they are in the wound site, monocytes mature into macrophages. Macrophages also secrete a number of factors such as growth factors and other cytokines, especially during the third and fourth post-wounding days. These factors attract cells involved in the proliferation stage of healing to the area.\n\nIn wound healing that result in incomplete repair, scar contraction occurs, bringing varying gradations of structural imperfections, deformities and problems with flexibility. Macrophages may restrain the contraction phase. Scientists have reported that removing the macrophages from a salamander resulted in failure of a typical regeneration response (limb regeneration), instead bringing on a repair (scarring) response.\n\nAs inflammation dies down, fewer inflammatory factors are secreted, existing ones are broken down, and numbers of neutrophils and macrophages are reduced at the wound site. These changes indicate that the inflammatory phase is ending and the proliferative phase is underway. In vitro evidence, obtained using the dermal equivalent model, suggests that the presence of macrophages actually delays wound contraction and thus the disappearance of macrophages from the wound may be essential for subsequent phases to occur.\n\nBecause inflammation plays roles in fighting infection, clearing debris and inducing the proliferation phase, it is a necessary part of healing. However, inflammation can lead to tissue damage if it lasts too long. Thus the reduction of inflammation is frequently a goal in therapeutic settings. Inflammation lasts as long as there is debris in the wound. Thus, if the individual's immune system is compromised and is unable to clear the debris from the wound and/or if excessive detritus, devitalized tissue, or microbial biofilm is present in the wound, these factors may cause a prolonged inflammatory phase and prevent the wound from properly commencing the proliferation phase of healing. This can lead to a chronic wound.\n\nAbout two or three days after the wound occurs, fibroblasts begin to enter the wound site, marking the onset of the proliferative phase even before the inflammatory phase has ended. As in the other phases of wound healing, steps in the proliferative phase do not occur in a series but rather partially overlap in time.\n\nAlso called neovascularization, the process of angiogenesis occurs concurrently with fibroblast proliferation when endothelial cells migrate to the area of the wound. Because the activity of fibroblasts and epithelial cells requires oxygen and nutrients, angiogenesis is imperative for other stages in wound healing, like epidermal and fibroblast migration. The tissue in which angiogenesis has occurred typically looks red (is erythematous) due to the presence of capillaries.\n\nAngiogenesis occurs in overlapping phases in response to inflammation:\n\nStem cells of endothelial cells, originating from parts of uninjured blood vessels, develop pseudopodia and push through the ECM into the wound site to establish new blood vessels.\n\nEndothelial cells are attracted to the wound area by fibronectin found on the fibrin scab and chemotactically by angiogenic factors released by other cells, e.g. from macrophages and platelets when in a low-oxygen environment. Endothelial growth and proliferation is also directly stimulated by hypoxia, and presence of lactic acid in the wound. For example, hypoxia stimulates the endothelial transcription factor, hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF) to transactivate a set of proliferative genes including vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and glucose transporter 1 (GLUT1).\n\nTo migrate, endothelial cells need collagenases and plasminogen activator to degrade the clot and part of the ECM. Zinc-dependent metalloproteinases digest basement membrane and ECM to allow cell migration, proliferation and angiogenesis.\n\nWhen macrophages and other growth factor-producing cells are no longer in a hypoxic, lactic acid-filled environment, they stop producing angiogenic factors. Thus, when tissue is adequately perfused, migration and proliferation of endothelial cells is reduced. Eventually blood vessels that are no longer needed die by apoptosis.\n\nSimultaneously with angiogenesis, fibroblasts begin accumulating in the wound site. Fibroblasts begin entering the wound site two to five days after wounding as the inflammatory phase is ending, and their numbers peak at one to two weeks post-wounding. By the end of the first week, fibroblasts are the main cells in the wound. Fibroplasia ends two to four weeks after wounding.\n\nAs a model the mechanism of fibroplasia may be conceptualised as an analogous process to angiogenesis (see above) - only the cell type involved is fibroblasts rather than endothelial cells. Initially there is a latent phase where the wound undergoes plasma exudation, inflammatory decontamination and debridement. Oedema increases the wound histologic accessibility for later fibroplastic migration. Second, as inflammation nears completion, macrophage and mast cells release fibroblast growth and chemotactic factors to activate fibroblasts from adjacent tissue. Fibroblasts at this stage loosen themselves from surrounding cells and ECM. Phagocytes further release proteases that break down the ECM of neighbouring tissue, freeing the activated fibroblasts to proliferate and migrate towards the wound. The difference between vascular sprouting and fibroblast proliferation is that the former is enhanced by hypoxia, whilst the latter is inhibited by hypoxia. The deposited fibroblastic connective tissue matures by secreting ECM into the extracellular space, forming granulation tissue (see below). Lastly collagen is deposited into the ECM.\n\nIn the first two or three days after injury, fibroblasts mainly migrate and proliferate, while later, they are the main cells that lay down the collagen matrix in the wound site. Origins of these fibroblasts are thought to be from the adjacent uninjured cutaneous tissue (although new evidence suggests that some are derived from blood-borne, circulating adult stem cells/precursors). Initially fibroblasts utilize the fibrin cross-linking fibers (well-formed by the end of the inflammatory phase) to migrate across the wound, subsequently adhering to fibronectin. Fibroblasts then deposit ground substance into the wound bed, and later collagen, which they can adhere to for migration.\n\nGranulation tissue functions as rudimentary tissue, and begins to appear in the wound already during the inflammatory phase, two to five days post wounding, and continues growing until the wound bed is covered. Granulation tissue consists of new blood vessels, fibroblasts, inflammatory cells, endothelial cells, myofibroblasts, and the components of a new, provisional extracellular matrix (ECM). The provisional ECM is different in composition from the ECM in normal tissue and its components originate from fibroblasts. Such components include fibronectin, collagen, glycosaminoglycans, elastin, glycoproteins and proteoglycans. Its main components are fibronectin and hyaluronan, which create a very hydrated matrix and facilitate cell migration. Later this provisional matrix is replaced with an ECM that more closely resembles that found in non-injured tissue.\n\nGrowth factors (PDGF, TGF-β) and fibronectin encourage proliferation, migration to the wound bed, and production of ECM molecules by fibroblasts. Fibroblasts also secrete growth factors that attract epithelial cells to the wound site. Hypoxia also contributes to fibroblast proliferation and excretion of growth factors, though too little oxygen will inhibit their growth and deposition of ECM components, and can lead to excessive, fibrotic scarring.\n\nOne of fibroblasts' most important duties is the production of collagen.\n\nCollagen deposition is important because it increases the strength of the wound; before it is laid down, the only thing holding the wound closed is the fibrin-fibronectin clot, which does not provide much resistance to traumatic injury. Also, cells involved in inflammation, angiogenesis, and connective tissue construction attach to, grow and differentiate on the collagen matrix laid down by fibroblasts.\n\nType III collagen and fibronectin generally begin to be produced in appreciable amounts at somewhere between approximately 10 hours and 3 days, depending mainly on wound size. Their deposition peaks at one to three weeks. They are the predominating tensile substances until the later phase of maturation, in which they are replaced by the stronger type I collagen.\n\nEven as fibroblasts are producing new collagen, collagenases and other factors degrade it. Shortly after wounding, synthesis exceeds degradation so collagen levels in the wound rise, but later production and degradation become equal so there is no net collagen gain. This homeostasis signals the onset of the later maturation phase. Granulation gradually ceases and fibroblasts decrease in number in the wound once their work is done. At the end of the granulation phase, fibroblasts begin to commit apoptosis, converting granulation tissue from an environment rich in cells to one that consists mainly of collagen.\n\nThe formation of granulation tissue into an open wound allows the reepithelialization phase to take place, as epithelial cells migrate across the new tissue to form a barrier between the wound and the environment. Basal keratinocytes from the wound edges and dermal appendages such as hair follicles, sweat glands and sebacious (oil) glands are the main cells responsible for the epithelialization phase of wound healing. They advance in a sheet across the wound site and proliferate at its edges, ceasing movement when they meet in the middle. In healing that results in a scar, sweat glands, hair follicles and nerves do not form. With the lack of hair follicles, nerves and sweat glands, the wound, and the resulting healing scar, provide a challenge to the body with regards to temperature control.\n\nKeratinocytes migrate without first proliferating. Migration can begin as early as a few hours after wounding. However, epithelial cells require viable tissue to migrate across, so if the wound is deep it must first be filled with granulation tissue. Thus the time of onset of migration is variable and may occur about one day after wounding. Cells on the wound margins proliferate on the second and third day post-wounding in order to provide more cells for migration.\n\nIf the basement membrane is not breached, epithelial cells are replaced within three days by division and upward migration of cells in the stratum basale in the same fashion that occurs in uninjured skin. However, if the basement membrane is ruined at the wound site, reepithelization must occur from the wound margins and from skin appendages such as hair follicles and sweat and oil glands that enter the dermis that are lined with viable keratinocytes. If the wound is very deep, skin appendages may also be ruined and migration can only occur from wound edges.\n\nMigration of keratinocytes over the wound site is stimulated by lack of contact inhibition and by chemicals such as nitric oxide. Before they begin to migrate, cells must dissolve their desmosomes and hemidesmosomes, which normally anchor the cells by intermediate filaments in their cytoskeleton to other cells and to the ECM. Transmembrane receptor proteins called integrins, which are made of glycoproteins and normally anchor the cell to the basement membrane by its cytoskeleton, are released from the cell's intermediate filaments and relocate to actin filaments to serve as attachments to the ECM for pseudopodia during migration. Thus keratinocytes detach from the basement membrane and are able to enter the wound bed.\n\nBefore they begin migrating, keratinocytes change shape, becoming longer and flatter and extending cellular processes like lamellipodia and wide processes that look like ruffles. Actin filaments and pseudopodia form. During migration, integrins on the pseudopod attach to the ECM, and the actin filaments in the projection pull the cell along. The interaction with molecules in the ECM through integrins further promotes the formation of actin filaments, lamellipodia, and filopodia.\n\nEpithelial cells climb over one another in order to migrate. This growing sheet of epithelial cells is often called the epithelial tongue. The first cells to attach to the basement membrane form the stratum basale. These basal cells continue to migrate across the wound bed, and epithelial cells above them slide along as well. The more quickly this migration occurs, the less of a scar there will be.\n\nFibrin, collagen, and fibronectin in the ECM may further signal cells to divide and migrate. Like fibroblasts, migrating keratinocytes use the fibronectin cross-linked with fibrin that was deposited in inflammation as an attachment site to crawl across. \n\nAs keratinocytes migrate, they move over granulation tissue but stay underneath the scab, thereby separating the scab from the underlying tissue. Scabs are formed on locations that are exposed to harmful UVR and the main biological function of\nhuman wound scabs is to inhibit the exposure to UVR, thus protecting otherwise exposed cells in a wound from UVR-induced DNA damage. Epithelial cells have the ability to phagocytize debris such as dead tissue and bacterial matter that would otherwise obstruct their path. Because they must dissolve any scab that forms, keratinocyte migration is best enhanced by a moist environment, since a dry one leads to formation of a bigger, tougher scab. To make their way along the tissue, keratinocytes must dissolve the clot, debris, and parts of the ECM in order to get through. They secrete plasminogen activator, which activates plasminogen, turning it into plasmin to dissolve the scab. Cells can only migrate over living tissue, so they must excrete collagenases and proteases like matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) to dissolve damaged parts of the ECM in their way, particularly at the front of the migrating sheet. Keratinocytes also dissolve the basement membrane, using instead the new ECM laid down by fibroblasts to crawl across.\n\nAs keratinocytes continue migrating, new epithelial cells must be formed at the wound edges to replace them and to provide more cells for the advancing sheet. Proliferation behind migrating keratinocytes normally begins a few days after wounding and occurs at a rate that is 17 times higher in this stage of epithelialization than in normal tissues. Until the entire wound area is resurfaced, the only epithelial cells to proliferate are at the wound edges.\n\nGrowth factors, stimulated by integrins and MMPs, cause cells to proliferate at the wound edges. Keratinocytes themselves also produce and secrete factors, including growth factors and basement membrane proteins, which aid both in epithelialization and in other phases of healing. Growth factors are also important for the innate immune defense of skin wounds by stimulation of the production of antimicrobial peptides and neutrophil chemotactic cytokines in keratinocytes. \nKeratinocytes continue migrating across the wound bed until cells from either side meet in the middle, at which point contact inhibition causes them to stop migrating. When they have finished migrating, the keratinocytes secrete the proteins that form the new basement membrane. Cells reverse the morphological changes they underwent in order to begin migrating; they reestablish desmosomes and hemidesmosomes and become anchored once again to the basement membrane. Basal cells begin to divide and differentiate in the same manner as they do in normal skin to reestablish the strata found in reepithelialized skin.\n\nContraction is a key phase of wound healing with repair. If contraction continues for too long, it can lead to disfigurement and loss of function. Thus there is a great interest in understanding the biology of wound contraction, which can be modelled in vitro using the collagen gel contraction assay or the dermal equivalent model.\n\nContraction commences approximately a week after wounding, when fibroblasts have differentiated into myofibroblasts. In full thickness wounds, contraction peaks at 5 to 15 days post wounding. Contraction can last for several weeks and continues even after the wound is completely reepithelialized. A large wound can become 40 to 80% smaller after contraction. Wounds can contract at a speed of up to 0.75 mm per day, depending on how loose the tissue in the wounded area is. Contraction usually does not occur symmetrically; rather most wounds have an 'axis of contraction' which allows for greater organization and alignment of cells with collagen.\n\nAt first, contraction occurs without myofibroblast involvement. Later, fibroblasts, stimulated by growth factors, differentiate into myofibroblasts. Myofibroblasts, which are similar to smooth muscle cells, are responsible for contraction. Myofibroblasts contain the same kind of actin as that found in smooth muscle cells.\n\nMyofibroblasts are attracted by fibronectin and growth factors and they move along fibronectin linked to fibrin in the provisional ECM in order to reach the wound edges. They form connections to the ECM at the wound edges, and they attach to each other and to the wound edges by desmosomes. Also, at an adhesion called the fibronexus, actin in the myofibroblast is linked across the cell membrane to molecules in the extracellular matrix like fibronectin and collagen. Myofibroblasts have many such adhesions, which allow them to pull the ECM when they contract, reducing the wound size. In this part of contraction, closure occurs more quickly than in the first, myofibroblast-independent part.\n\nAs the actin in myofibroblasts contracts, the wound edges are pulled together. Fibroblasts lay down collagen to reinforce the wound as myofibroblasts contract. The contraction stage in proliferation ends as myofibroblasts stop contracting and commit apoptosis. The breakdown of the provisional matrix leads to a decrease in hyaluronic acid and an increase in chondroitin sulfate, which gradually triggers fibroblasts to stop migrating and proliferating. These events signal the onset of the maturation stage of wound healing.\n\nWhen the levels of collagen production and degradation equalize, the maturation phase of tissue repair is said to have begun. During maturation, type III collagen, which is prevalent during proliferation, is replaced by type I collagen. Originally disorganized collagen fibers are rearranged, cross-linked, and aligned along tension lines. The onset of the maturation phase may vary extensively, depending on the size of the wound and whether it was initially closed or left open, ranging from approximately 3 days to 3 weeks. The maturation phase can last for a year or longer, similarly depending on wound type.\n\nAs the phase progresses, the tensile strength of the wound increases. Collagen will reach approximately 20% of its tensile strength after 3 weeks, increasing to 80% by 12th week. The maximum scar strength is 80% of that of unwounded skin. Since activity at the wound site is reduced, the scar loses its red appearance as blood vessels that are no longer needed are removed by apoptosis.\n\nThe phases of wound healing normally progress in a predictable, timely manner; if they do not, healing may progress inappropriately to either a chronic wound such as a venous ulcer or pathological scarring such as a keloid scar.\n\nMany factors controlling the efficacy, speed, and manner of wound healing fall under two types: local and systemic factors.\n\n\n\nUp until about 2000, the classic paradigm of wound healing, involving stem cells restricted to organ-specific lineages, had never been seriously challenged. Since then, the notion of adult stem cells having cellular \"plasticity\" or the ability to differentiate into non-lineage cells has emerged as an alternative explanation. To be more specific, hematopoietic progenitor cells (that give rise to mature cells in the blood) may have the ability \"de-differentiate\" back into hematopoietic stem cells and/or \"transdifferentiate\" into non-lineage cells, such as fibroblasts.\n\nMultipotent adult stem cells have the capacity to be self-renewing and give rise to different cell types. Stem cells give rise to progenitor cells, which are cells that are not self-renewing, but can generate several types of cells. The extent of stem cell involvement in cutaneous (skin) wound healing is complex and not fully understood.\n\nIt is thought that the epidermis and dermis are reconstituted by mitotically active stem cells that reside at the apex of rete ridges (basal stem cells or BSC), the bulge of hair follicles (hair follicular stem cell or HFSC), and the papillary dermis (dermal stem cells). Moreover, bone marrow may also contain stem cells that play a major role in cutaneous wound healing.\n\nIn rare circumstances, such as extensive cutaneous injury, self-renewal subpopulations in the bone marrow are induced to participate in the healing process, whereby they give rise to collagen-secreting cells that seem to play a role during wound repair. These two self-renewal subpopulations are (1) bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells (MSC) and (2) hematopoietic stem cells (HSC). Bone marrow also harbors a progenitor subpopulation (endothelial progenitor cells or EPC) that, in the same type of setting, are mobilized to aid in the reconstruction of blood vessels. Moreover, it thought that, extensive injury to skin also promotes the early trafficking of a unique subclass of leukocytes (circulating fibrocytes) to the injured region, where they perform various functions related to wound healing.\n\nAn injury is an interruption of morphology and/or functionality of a given tissue. After injury, structural tissue heals with incomplete or complete regeneration. Whereas, tissue without an interruption to the morphology almost always completely regenerates. An example of complete regeneration without an interruption of the morphology is non-injured tissue, such as skin. Non-injured skin has a continued replacement and regeneration of cells which always results in complete regeneration.\n\nThere is a subtle distinction between 'repair' and 'regeneration'. \"Repair\" means \"incomplete regeneration\". Repair or incomplete regeneration, refers to the physiologic adaptation of an organ after injury in an effort to re-establish continuity without regards to exact replacement of lost/damaged tissue. \n\"True tissue regeneration\" or \"complete regeneration\", refers to the replacement of lost/damaged tissue with an ‘exact’ copy, such that both morphology and functionality are completely restored. Though after injury mammals can completely regenerate spontaneously, they usually do not completely regenerate. An example of a tissue regenerating completely after an interruption of morphology is the endometrium; the endometrium after the process of breakdown via the menstruation cycle heals with complete regeneration.\n\nIn some instances, after a tissue breakdown, such as in skin, a regeneration closer to complete regeneration may be induced by the use of biodegradable (collagen-glycoaminoglycan) scaffolds. These scaffolds are structurally analogous to extracellular matrix (ECM) found in normal/un-injured dermis. Fundamental conditions required for tissue regeneration often oppose conditions that favor efficient wound repair, including inhibition of (1) platelet activation, (2) inflammatory response, and (3) wound contraction. In addition to providing support for fibroblast and endothelial cell attachment, biodegradable scaffolds inhibit wound contraction, thereby allowing the healing process to proceed towards a more-regenerative/less-scarring pathway. Pharmaceutical agents have been investigated which may be able to turn off myofibroblast differentiation.\n\nA new way of thinking derived from the notion that heparan sulfates are key player in tissue homeostasis: the process that makes the tissue replace dead cells by identical cells. In wound areas, tissue homeostasis is lost as the heparan sulfates are degraded preventing the replacement of dead cells by identical cells. Heparan sulfate analogues cannot be degraded by all know heparanases and glycanases and bind to the free heparin sulfate binding spots on the ECM, therefore preserving the normal tissue homeostasis and preventing scarring.\n\nRepair or regeneration with regards to hypoxia-inducible factor 1-alpha (HIF-1a). In normal circumstances after injury HIF-1a is degraded by prolyl hydroxylases (PHDs). Scientists found that the simple up-regulation of HIF-1a via PHD inhibitors regenerates lost or damaged tissue in mammals that have a repair response; and the continued down-regulation of Hif-1a results in healing with a scarring response in mammals with a previous regenerative response to the loss of tissue. The act of regulating HIF-1a can either turn off, or turn on the key process of mammalian regeneration.\n\n\"Scarless wound healing\" is a concept based on the healing or repair of the skin (or other tissue/organs) after injury with the aim of healing with subjectively and relatively \"less\" scar tissue than normally expected. Scarless healing is sometimes mixed up with the concept of \"scar free healing,\" which is wound healing which results in absolutely no scar (\"free\" of scarring). However they are different concepts.\n\nA reverse to scarless wound healing is scarification (wound healing to scar more). Historically, certain cultures consider scarification attractive; however, this is generally not the case in the modern western society, in which many patients are turning to plastic surgery clinics with unrealistic expectations. Depending on scar type, treatment may be invasive (intralesional steroid injections, surgery) and/or conservative (compression therapy, topical silicone gel, brachytherapy, photodynamic therapy). Clinical judgment is necessary to successfully balance the potential benefits of the various treatments available against the likelihood of a poor response and possible complications resulting from these treatments. Many of these treatments may only have a placebo effect, and the evidence base for the use of many current treatments is poor.\n\nSince the 1960s, comprehension of the basic biologic processes involved in wound repair and tissue regeneration have expanded due to advances in cellular and molecular biology. Currently, the principal goals in wound management are to achieve rapid wound closure with a functional tissue that has minimal aesthetic scarring. However, the ultimate goal of wound healing biology is to induce a more perfect reconstruction of the wound area. Scarless wound healing only occurs in mammalian foetal tissues and complete regeneration is limited to lower vertebrates, such as salamanders, and invertebrates. In adult humans, injured tissue are repaired by collagen deposition, collagen remodelling and eventual scar formation, where fetal wound healing is believed to be more of a regenerative process with minimal or no scar formation. Therefore, foetal wound healing can be used to provide an accessible mammalian model of an optimal healing response in adult human tissues. Clues as to how this might be achieved come from studies of wound healing in embryos, where repair is fast and efficient and results in essentially perfect regeneration of any lost tissue.\n\nThe etymology of the term scarless wound healing has a long history. In print the antiquated concept of scarless healing was brought up the early 20th century and appeared in a paper published in the London Lancet. This process involved cutting in a surgical slant, instead of a right angle…; it was described in various Newspapers.\n\nAfter inflammation, restoration of normal tissue integrity and function is preserved by feedback interactions between diverse cell types mediated by adhesion molecules and secreted cytokines. Disruption of normal feedback mechanisms in cancer threatens tissue integrity and enables a malignant tumor to escape the immune system.\n\nConsiderable effort has been devoted to understanding the physical relationships governing wound healing and subsequent scarring, with mathematical models and simulations developed to elucidate these relationships. The growth of tissue around the wound site is a result of the migration of cells and collagen deposition by these cells. The alignment of collagen describes the degree of scarring; basket-weave orientation of collagen is characteristic of normal skin, whereas aligned collagen fibers lead to significant scarring. It has been shown that the growth of tissue and extent of scar formation can be controlled by modulating the stress at a wound site.\n\nThe growth of tissue can be simulated using the aforementioned relationships from a biochemical and biomechanical point of view. The biologically active chemicals that play an important role in wound healing are modeled with Fickian diffusion to generate concentration profiles. The balance equation for open systems when modeling wound healing incorporates mass growth due to cell migration and proliferation. Here the following equation is used:\n\nDρ = Div (R) + R,\n\nwhere \"ρ\" represents mass density, \"R\" represents a mass flux (from cell migration), and \"R\" represents a mass source (from cell proliferation, division, or enlargement). Relationships like these can be incorporated into an agent-based models, where the sensitivity to single parameters such as initial collagen alignment, cytokine properties, and cell proliferation rates can be tested.\n\nSuccessful wound healing is dependent on various cell types, molecular mediators and structural elements.\n\nPrimary intention is the healing of a clean wound without tissue loss. In this process, wound edges are brought together, so that they are adjacent to each other (re-approximated). Wound closure is performed with sutures (stitches), staples, or adhesive tape or glue.\n\nPrimary intention can only be implemented when the wound is precise and there is minimal disruption to the local tissue and the epithelial basement membrane, e.g. surgical incisions.\n\nThis process is faster than healing by secondary intention. There is also less scarring associated with primary intention, as there are no large tissue losses to be filled with granulation tissue. (Primary intention does require some granulation tissue to form.)\n\n\n(Delayed primary closure or secondary suture):\n\nIf the wound edges are not reapproximated immediately, delayed primary wound healing transpires. This type of healing may be desired in the case of contaminated wounds. By the fourth day, phagocytosis of contaminated tissues is well underway, and the processes of epithelization, collagen deposition, and maturation are occurring. Foreign materials are walled off by macrophages that may metamorphose into epithelioid cells, which are encircled by mononuclear leukocytes, forming granulomas. Usually the wound is closed surgically at this juncture, and if the \"cleansing\" of the wound is incomplete, chronic inflammation can ensue, resulting in prominent scarring.\n\nFollowing are the main growth factors involved in wound healing:\n\nThe major complications are many:\n\n\nOther complications can include Infection and Marjolin's ulcer.\n\nAdvancements in the clinical understanding of wounds and their pathophysiology have commanded significant biomedical innovations in the treatment of acute, chronic, and other types of wounds. Many biologics, skin substitutes, biomembranes and scaffolds have been developed to facilitate wound healing through various mechanisms. This includes a number of products under the trade names such as \"Epicel\", \"Laserskin\", \"Transcyte, Dermagraft, AlloDerm/Strattice, Biobrane, Integra, Apligraf, OrCel, GraftJacket and PermaDerm.\"\n"}
