It ran on the Seven Network for 1,058 episodes at 7.30 pm Monday and Tuesday nights, from 18 November 1981 to 22 November 1993. It was produced at both ATN-7's production facility at Epping, New South Wales with exterior locations filmed in Pitt Town and Oakville in the outskirts of Northwest Sydney. Several of the regular cast members became highly popular celebrities through their roles in the series. It also featured a number of native Australian animals adding to its enduring appeal both domestically and internationally. After the series was cancelled by the Seven Network in 1993 a reworked version of the series ran briefly on Network Ten in 1994. \"A Country Practice\" was the longest running Australian drama upon its demise, At its height the show attracted 8–10 million viewers weekly, when the population of the time was a mere 15 million, and was eventually sold to 48 countries.\n\n\"A Country Practice\" creator James Davern of JNP Productions, had worked on a previous similar type rural series, as producer and director of the long-running Bellbird and had written the pilot episode for ACP and entered a script contest for the Ten Network in 1979. He came third and won a merit award., although TEN turned the series down, the Seven Network picked up the series stating it liked the characters and setting. Davern would be inducted into the Logie Hall of Fame in 1991 and be honoured as an Order of Australia recipient in 2014.\n\n\"A Country Practice\" is the third most successful television program in the history of the Logie Awards, after \"Home and Away\" (1st) and \"Neighbours\" (2nd), having won 29 awards during its twelve years of production.\n\nLogie Awards 1983\n\nLogie awards 1984\n\nLogie Awards 1985\n\nLogie Awards 1986\n\nLogie Awards 1987\n\nLogie Awards 1988\n\nLogie Awards 1989\n\nLogie Awards 1990\n\nLogie Awards 1991\n\nLogie Awards 1992\n\nLogie Awards 1993\n\nThough sometimes considered a soap opera, the storylines of the show's two one-hour episodes screened over any one week formed a self-contained narrative block. The storylines were meant to have a primary appeal to adult and older youthful audiences, and in particular they had greater appeal to children from middle-class backgrounds. As it did not have the open ended narrative of a traditional soap opera, it was technically a \"series\". Nevertheless, many storylines were developed as sub-plots for several episodes before becoming the focus of a particular week's narrative block. Overall, the program \"so emphasized the ongoing storylines of its major characters as to make the distinction between series and serial more or less meaningless\".\n\nThe series followed the workings of a small hospital in the fictional New South Wales rural country town of Wandin Valley as well as its connected medical clinic, the town's veterinary surgery, RSL club/pub and local police station. The show's storylines focused on the staff, and regular patients of the hospital and general practice, their families, and other residents of the town. Through its weekly guest actors, who appeared in the series portrayed differing characters, it explored various social and medical problems. The series examined such topical issues as youth unemployment, suicide, drug addiction, HIV/AIDS and terminal illness, as well as Aborigines and their importance in modern Australian society. Apart from its regular rotating cast, mainly among the younger personnel, \"A Country Practice\" also had a cast of semi-regulars who would make appearances as the storylines permitted. One of the more popular and frequent characters from its inception included the valley's corrupt town councillor Alfred Muldoon (Brian Moll). The program as well would also showcase a number of animal stars and Australian native wildlife, most famously Fatso the wombat. Fatso was played throughout the series by three separate wombats, Fatso (1981–1986) replaced due to temperament issues with the cast, George (1986–1990) replaced due to early signs of wombat mange (a marsupial viral disease), and Garth (1990 through series end).\n\nIconic storylines over its lengthy 12-year run included the wedding of Dr. Simon Bowen, to local vet Vicki Dean, in 1983, and the later wedding of Dr. Terence Elliot to Matron Rosemary Prior amidst the series' bushfire scenes that marked the final episodes. The death of nurse Donna Manning in a car crash, the off-screen death of longtime resident Shirley Gilroy in a plane crash, as well as the final undoing of town councillor Alf Muldoon, which were highly watched. The highest rating episode however featured the death of beloved farmer Molly Jones from leukemia in 1985. After being diagnosed, receiving treatment and battling the terminal illness, Molly retires to her garden, watching her husband nurse Brenden and young daughter Chloe flying a kite and passes away peacefully as the screen fades to black. Molly's death storyline was originally written for an 11-week script, but producers realized that her death was proposed in a week the ratings were not being monitored, hence the storyline lasted 13 weeks and an extra two episodes.\n\nAfter its lengthy run on the Seven Network, just months after its demise it was announced that the serial would be picked up by Network Ten with a mainly new cast and a few key cast members continuing from the Seven series. \nUnlike the Seven series which was produced in Sydney, the Network Ten series was produced in Melbourne with location shooting in Emerald, Victoria. The new series debuted in April 1994, but it was not as successful as its predecessor and was abruptly cancelled in November.\n\n\"A Country Practice\" became renowned for its long list of guest cameos, totalling over 1000 stars, with well known mainly Australian actors (predominately of the period) who would appear in each week's two part episode arc, similar to other such series like \"Prisoner\", including for example: Ray Meagher, Amanda Muggleton and Sons and Daughters regulars Tom Richards and Leila Hayes. Some actors became more prominent during the series runs, and were classified as semi-regulars, appearing as the storyline permitted, Famous international stars included: Baz Luhrmann, Smokey Dawson, John Meillon (the program would also feature Meillon's one time wife June Salter), Sir Robert Helpmann, Nicole Kidman, Paul Kelly, Toni Collette, Delta Goodrem, Peter Phelps and Simon Baker. At the program's height even the then Prime Minister of Australia, Bob Hawke, appeared as himself.\n\nIn late 2005, MRA Entertainment announced they had obtained the rights to release the entire series on DVD. In 2008, Magna Pacific Pty Ltd bought out MRA Entertainment, with plans to release Series 6, however the rights were then acquired by Beyond Home Entertainment which then re-released the first 5 seasons in 2007-2008, followed by Season 6 in 2010. As of October 2018 Beyond Home Entertainment haven't received the rights to release further seasons. \n\n\nMr. Brenden Jones - Shane Withington\nJudy Loveday - Wendy Strehlow\nDonna Manning - Caroline Johansson\nMichael Langley - Brett Climo\nLucy Gardner - Georgie Parker\nSister Kate Bryant - Michelle Pettigrove\n\nShirley Gilroy - Lorrae Desmond\n\nVicki Dean - Penny Cook\nBen Green - Nickolas Bufalo\nMatthew Tyler - John Tarrant\nAnna Lacey - Anne Looby\n\nCathy Hayden - Kate Raison\nTrevor Jackson - Michael Watson\n\nFrank Gilroy (Sgt.) - Brian Wenzel\nTom Newman - (Senior Sgt.)

Also Replayed a few episodes in 2014 on channel 7two at 2pm Monday to Friday.\n\nIn addition to being broadcast in Australia, the series also had a successful run on the ITV network in the United Kingdom. Shown regionally from October 1982 to March 1999 (HTV), episodes were initially shown in their original format as a one-hour episode per week (Wednesdays), however, from 1984, Yorkshire Television screened it as two half-hour editions over two days (Mondays and Tuesdays). This format eventually led to the series being stripped Monday to Friday as five continuous daily episodes, and by 1990, the half-hour format was adopted across most of the ITV network.\n\nConsidered a daytime soap and notably several years behind Australian broadcasts, \"A Country Practice\" was very popular in the UK and achieved consolidated viewing figures of between 2–3 million which is good for daytime television. To that end, some regions (HTV and Granada) moved the later episodes of the series to an early evening slot of 17.10–17.40.\n\nITV Broadcasts\n\nSatellite and Cable Broadcasts\n\nA Country Practice only screened in England once unlike other soap opera/serials such as \"Prisoner\" that was broadcast multiple times and also \"Sons and Daughters\"\n\n\"A Country Practice\" also aired in Ireland, New Zealand, Germany, France, Italy, Norway, Sweden, Hong Kong, Zimbabwe, Kenya, and was carried on several United States and Canada stations, both during the show's lifetime and after.\n\nIt was estimated that at its height, the show received a worldwide audience of five to six million each week.\n\naired on RTÉ Two weekdays at 18:00 or 18.30. In Autumn 1988, to make way for \"Home and Away\", it moved to main channel RTÉ One airing weekdays at 17:30. The final episode (1088) aired in 1996. RTÉ stripped episodes into a 30-minute timeslot. RTÉ commenced a repeat in 1998 beginning with season 8 (1988) in a morning slot.\n\nA Country Practice was named \"À Coeur Ouvert\".\n\nA Country Practice was named \"Das Buschkrankenhaus\".\n\nA Country Practice was named \"Wandin Valley\".\n\nA Country Practice (called \"Hverdagsliv\") was broadcast on TV2 during the 1990s\n\nwas also transmitted on Kenyan Television (VoK now KBC) during the 1980s.\n\nbroadcast on ZBC state television in the 1980s\n\nwas transmitted on TV2 on Sunday afternoons in the late 1980s and early 1990s\n\nThe entire series was broadcast, from start to finish, by CBC Television outlet CBET in Windsor, Ontario. Two episodes were broadcast daily, Monday through Friday, starting in the late 1980s, until they were caught up to contemporary episodes in the early 1990s. Its inclusion on CBET's schedule was out of necessity to fill a television schedule: because Windsor was part of the same advertising market as Detroit, Michigan in the United States, they are subject to the North American Border Protection Rule, under which Detroit television stations cannot carry programming licensed for broadcast in Windsor, and Windsor stations cannot carry programming licensed for broadcast in Detroit. Most American programming that was part of the CBC schedule throughout Canada could not be broadcast by CBET and, thus, was replaced by programming imported from Britain and Australia. Many Australian soap operas, \"A Country Practice\" among them, have thus found loyal audiences in the Metro Detroit area, while they otherwise remain unknown in North America.\n\nFrom 1991 to 1994, the show also aired on ASN, a cable network that served Canada's Maritimes. Four hour-long episodes aired each week, from Monday to Thursday with Monday's and Tuesday's episodes repeated on Saturday and Wednesday's and Thursday's episodes on Sunday. The station aired the show from episode 1 to somewhere in the early 700s.\n\nASN ceased carrying the show when specialty cable channel Showcase was launched on 1 January 1995, as they picked up \"A Country Practice\" for broadcast throughout Canada. It broadcast one episode daily, from Monday to Friday, and completed the entire series run (including the 30-episode Network Ten series) in June 1999. It began rebroadcasting the entire series on 28 June 1999, with promises that the entire series would be broadcast for those who missed the first airing. However, a single line of text scrolling across the bottom of the screen during the 21 August 2000, episode announced that the show would be removed from the Showcase lineup as of Monday, 28 August 2000. According to the station's email autoresponse at the time, the decision was based on \"declining viewership and a demand by viewers for more current programming\". Sometime after that, Showcase changed their format to favour a less family-oriented and more adult-oriented viewership.\n\nSeries writer Judith Colquhoun, who also wrote episodes for other Australian serials, \"Blue Heelers\", \"Neighbours\" and \"Home and Away\" released a novel in 2015. Called \"New Beginnings\", it is based on the early episodes of the series from 1981.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "20862405", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=20862405", "title": "Abortion in Venezuela", "text": "Abortion in Venezuela\n\nAbortion in Venezuela is currently illegal except in some specific cases outlined in the Venezuelan Constitution. The Latin American/Caribbean region holds one of the highest rates of induced abortion in the world; it is calculated that for every 1,000 live births, there are just over 300 abortions, many of which are illegal and/or clandestine abortions. There is not a clear statistic for Venezuela-specific abortion rates, possibly due to a great majority of the abortions that occur going undocumented. The punishment for a woman who has an abortion for any other reason is a prison sentence lasting anywhere between six months and two years. While the punishment for a doctor or any person who performs the procedure is between one and three years, harsher penalties may apply if the pregnant woman dies as a result of the procedure. There has been debate over this controversial topic for several years, among other issues pertaining to reproductive health, particularly in the Catholic church. The current status of abortion in Venezuela is exacerbated by the economic crisis fueled by a lack of access to healthcare. Despite limited financial means due to the crisis, some groups are advocating for abortion rights.\n\nAny surgical or medicinal method of termination of a pregnancy can be classified as an induced abortion. \n\nA clandestine abortion is one that is not performed under proper medical care or safe conditions. Since abortion is illegal in Venezuela, a clandestine procedure is often the only choice that a woman has in terminating an unwanted pregnancy, unless she is faced with certain conditions. \n\nVenezuela's policy on abortion follows the \"indications model,\" meaning that it is permissible only when the pregnancy is a threat to the health of the pregnant woman, it is a result of rape, or the fetus cannot live outside of the womb.\n\nThe Venezuelan Penal code outlines regulations for having/administering an abortion procedure.\n\nArticle 340 of the Penal Code states that \"a women who intentionally aborts, using means employed by herself or by a third party with their consent, shall be punished with prison for six months to two years.\n\nArticle 433 offers an exception: \"a person carrying out an abortion will not incur any penalty if it is an indispensable measure to save the life of the mother.\"\n\nAttitudes toward abortion policies have changed as different political leaders have assumed power in Venezuela. The economic crisis in Venezuela has served as another influence on policy Some groups are combating policies to fight for abortion rights.\n\nHugo Chavez intended to minimize the gap between the rich and poor and give Venezuelans a better life. This, along with his intent to reform the Constitution, implies that he was in favor of abortion rights, though it was not explicitly said. In Venezuela, the discovery of oil provided an economic boom lasting a period from World War 1 to the 1980s. This period of prosperity was ended by an oil crisis in 1973, which led to a great amount of debt that continued into Chavez's presidency and topped 120 billion in 2011. During the Trienio Adeco period (1945-1948), Venezuela was under democratic rule by several presidents, until Hugo Chavez won Venezuela's presidential election in 1998. Chavez ruled Venezuela as a Bolivarian government starting in 1999, one that followed a left-wing socialist movement that advocated mainly for financial equity, democracy, and anti-corrupt government. He formed the United Socialist Party of Venezuela in 2007, as well as many other programs that catered to the poor, such as the “Bolivarian Missions” to provide universal healthcare coverage under 'Chavezcare' and increase educational opportunities for the poor. Among his policies were plans to amend the Venezuelan constitution to decriminalize abortion.\n\nWhile he was relatively well-liked by the poor in Venezuela, he also received some opposition. The Venezuelan National Strike of 2002-2003 started as an attempt to remove Chavez from office. As a result, the country's oil company Petróleos de Venezuela, S.A. (PDVSA) lost money, and since the economy largely depends on the oil industry, the nation's GDP fell significantly. Despite this and other strikes against him, Chavez remained in office until he was too ill to run as president. \n\nAs of yet, Maduro has not mentioned plans to amend to Constitution in favor of abortion rights. After Chavez's presidency, Nicolas Maduro took over after what some call a rigged election, as Chavez appointed him. He continued to implement the socialist policies that Chavez started, though some argue he rules as a dictator. In 2013, Venezuela's currency lost value due to shortages in essentials such as staple foods and toiletries. Since then, Venezuela has been in an economic crisis, where inflation has reached an all-time high. Maduro issued a state of emergency in 2016, allowing Venezuelans to cross Colombian borders for greater access to necessities, though for those in compromising situations this is not a possibility. Maduro was re-elected to office in 2018, though some continue to deem it an illegitimate election. \n\nThere have been U.S. sanctions placed on oil export, preventing foreign entities from purchasing oil stock; this hurt Venezuela's economy because oil makes up so much of its GDP, which only aggravated the crisis. \n\nThe Economic Crisis In Venezuela has led to a decrease in access to contraceptives, and has caused many women to resort to sterilization and abortion as a family planning method. Since 2013, the crisis has left Venezuelans with a grim outlook on healthcare, as 90 percent of all citizens live in poverty. Medicine is at a massive shortage, with over 80% of medicinal access restricted by the crisis. \n\nAlong with healthcare, particularly affected are Venezuelans’ access to contraceptives. Since contraceptives are not considered an “essential medicine,” they are at an even greater shortage than non-contraceptive medications. The few contraceptives available are subject to high inflation rates. For instance, a three-pack of condoms can cost several weeks’ worth of minimum wage pay , and a box of birth control pills can cost almost a year's worth of pay at the same rate, making them virtually unaffordable for citizens. \n\nFor most, the high prices of contraceptives force them to resort to abstinence or sterilization. Though the sterilization procedure is expensive, some would rather pay over caring for children they cannot afford. This is done in lieu of later clandestine abortions. The Intercept reports that some of the women who opt for sterilization are as young as 14 years old. \n\nDuring his presidency, Hugo Chavez operated Venezuela under a socialist economy, which was meant to promote equality. Some groups, such as the Feminists in Free and Direct Action for Safe Abortions in Revolution, were formed during his presidency. This group, along with many others, advocates for ending dangerous clandestine abortion. Similarly, Venezuela's National Constituent Assembly (ANC), formed in July 2017, advocates for the reformation of Venezuela's constitution to include women's right to abort beyond those outlined by the “indications model.” \n\nOther efforts to support the movement include the efforts of one group to use a telephone hotline to inform women on how to safely have an abortion. Misoprostol is a drug that can be used to induce labor and cause a medical abortion, which is any abortion done via drug. This hotline provides women with the ability to make an informed decision about proceeding with an abortion. It does not, however, change the legal status of abortion in Venezuela, nor does it provide women access to medical care. Due to abortion's legal status, Venezuelans often obtain misoprostol through the black market, which is expensive and puts the mother at risk.\n\nThe population of Venezuela is over three-quarters Roman Catholic, making Catholic norms more prevalent in Venezuelan society than any other religion. Abortion laws are debated by those with Catholic beliefs, as some Catholics hold that ‘artificial’ forms of birth control (abortion, condoms, or birth control pills) do not align with the Catholic moral code, and “that abortion is a result of widespread immorality and ignorance.” Protests against abortion-restrictive laws have raised concern for the Catholic community; in May 2006, Pope Benedict XVI met with President Hugo Chavez to discuss his concern over the possibility that Chavez would loosen abortion laws in Venezuela.\n\nMisoprostol, though it is among the safer forms of clandestine abortion, can be dangerous if not taken under medical supervision. It may cause hemorrhaging and other adverse effects such as infection. If left untreated, it could lead to death. It is estimated that around 6,000 women die every year in Latin America alone because of unsafe abortions. Unsafe abortions, including those done via misoprostol, contribute significantly to maternal and overall female mortality in Venezuela.\n\n"}
{"id": "39043", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=39043", "title": "African clawed frog", "text": "African clawed frog\n\nThe African clawed frog (\"Xenopus laevis\", also known as the xenopus, African clawed toad, African claw-toed frog or the platanna) is a species of African aquatic frog of the family Pipidae. Its name is derived from the three short claws on each hind foot, which it uses to tear apart its food. The word \"Xenopus\" means \"strange foot\" and \"laevis\" means \"smooth\".\n\nThe species is found throughout much of Sub-Saharan Africa (Nigeria and Sudan to South Africa), and in isolated, introduced populations in North America, South America, and Europe. All species of the family Pipidae are tongueless, toothless and completely aquatic. They use their hands to shove food in their mouths and down their throats and a hyobranchial pump to draw or suck things in their mouth. Pipidae have powerful legs for swimming and lunging after food. They also use the claws on their feet to tear pieces of large food. They lack true ears, but have lateral lines running down the length of the body and underside, which is how they can sense movements and vibrations in the water. They use their sensitive fingers, sense of smell, and lateral line system to find food. Pipidae are scavengers and will eat almost anything living, dying, or dead and any type of organic waste.\n\nThese frogs are plentiful in ponds and rivers within the south-eastern portion of Sub-Saharan Africa. They are aquatic and are often greenish-grey in color. Albino varieties are commonly sold as pets. \"Wild type\" African clawed frogs are also frequently sold as pets, and often incorrectly labeled as a Congo frog or African dwarf frog because of similar colorings. They are easily distinguished from African dwarf frogs because African clawed frogs have webbing only on their hind feet while African dwarf frogs have webbing on all four feet.\n\nThey reproduce by fertilizing eggs outside of the female's body (see frog reproduction). Of the seven amplexus modes (positions in which frogs mate), these frogs are found breeding in inguinal amplexus, where the male clasps the female in front of the female's back legs and squeezes until eggs come out. The eggs are then fertilized.\n\nThe clawed frogs are the only amphibians to have actual claws used to climb and shred foods like fish or tadpoles. They lay their eggs from winter until spring. During wet rainy seasons they will travel to other ponds or puddles of water to search for food.\n\n\"X. laevis\" have been known to survive 15 or more years in the wild and 25–30 years in captivity. They shed their skin every season, and eat their own shed skin.\n\nAlthough lacking a vocal sac, the males make a mating call of alternating long and short trills, by contracting the intrinsic laryngeal muscles. Females also answer vocally, signaling either acceptance (a rapping sound) or rejection (slow ticking) of the male. This frog has smooth slippery skin which is multicolored on its back with blotches of olive gray or brown. The underside is creamy white with a yellow tinge.\n\nMale and female frogs can be easily distinguished through the following differences. Male frogs are usually about 20% smaller than females, with slim bodies and legs. Males make mating calls to attract females, sounding very much like a cricket calling underwater. Females are larger than the males, appearing far more plump with hip-like bulges above their rear legs (where their eggs are internally located).\n\nBoth males and females have a cloaca, which is a chamber through which digestive and urinary wastes pass and through which the reproductive systems also empty. The cloaca empties by way of the vent which in reptiles and amphibians is a single opening for all three systems.\n\nIn the wild, \"Xenopus laevis\" are native to wetlands, ponds, and lakes across arid/semiarid regions of Sub-Saharan Africa. \"Xenopus laevis\" and \"Xenopus muelleri\" occur along the western boundary of the Great African Rift. The people of the sub-Saharan are generally very familiar with this frog, and some cultures use it as a source of protein, an aphrodisiac, or as fertility medicine. Two historic outbreaks of priapism have been linked to consumption of frog legs from frogs that ate insects containing cantharidin. Wild \"Xenopus\" are much larger than their captive bred counterparts.\n\"Xenopus laevis\" in the wild are commonly infected by various parasites, including monogeneans in the urinary bladder.\n\n\"Xenopus\" embryos and eggs are a popular model system for a wide variety of biological studies. This animal is widely used because of its powerful combination of experimental tractability and close evolutionary relationship with humans, at least compared to many model organisms. For a more comprehensive discussion of the use of these frogs in biomedical research, see \"Xenopus\".\n\nIn the early 1930s, two South African researchers, Hillel Shapiro and Harry Zwarenstein, who were students of Lancelot Hogben at Cape Town University, developed a test for human pregnancy by injecting the woman's urine into a Xenopus laevis frog. If the frog ovulated, the woman was pregnant. This simple and reliable test was universally used throughout the 1930s to 1960s. \n\n\"Xenopus\" has long been an important tool for in vivo studies in molecular, cell, and developmental biology of vertebrate animals. However, the wide breadth of \"Xenopus\" research stems from the additional fact that cell-free extracts made from \"Xenopus\" are a premier in vitro system for studies of fundamental aspects of cell and molecular biology. Thus, \"Xenopus\" is the only vertebrate model system that allows for high-throughput in vivo analyses of gene function and high-throughput biochemistry. Finally, \"Xenopus\" oocytes are a leading system for studies of ion transport and channel physiology.\n\nAlthough \"X. laevis\" does not have the short generation time and genetic simplicity generally desired in genetic model organisms, it is an important model organism in developmental biology, cell biology, toxicology and neurobiology. \"X. laevis\" takes 1 to 2 years to reach sexual maturity and, like most of its genus, it is tetraploid. It does have a large and easily manipulated embryo, however. The ease of manipulation in amphibian embryos has given them an important place in historical and modern developmental biology. A related species, \"Xenopus tropicalis\", is now being promoted as a more viable model for genetics.\n\nRoger Wolcott Sperry used \"X. laevis\" for his famous experiments describing the development of the visual system. These experiments led to the formulation of the Chemoaffinity hypothesis.\n\n\"Xenopus\" oocytes provide an important expression system for molecular biology. By injecting DNA or mRNA into the oocyte or developing embryo, scientists can study the protein products in a controlled system. This allows rapid functional expression of manipulated DNAs (or mRNA). This is particularly useful in electrophysiology, where the ease of recording from the oocyte makes expression of membrane channels attractive. One challenge of oocyte work is eliminating native proteins that might confound results, such as membrane channels native to the oocyte. Translation of proteins can be blocked or splicing of pre-mRNA can be modified by injection of Morpholino antisense oligos into the oocyte (for distribution throughout the embryo) or early embryo (for distribution only into daughter cells of the injected cell).\n\nExtracts from the eggs of \"X. laevis\" frogs are also commonly used for biochemical studies of DNA replication and repair, as these extracts fully support DNA replication and other related processes in a cell-free environment which allows easier manipulation.\n\nThe first vertebrate ever to be cloned was an African clawed frog, an experiment for which Sir John Gurdon was awarded the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine 2012 \"for the discovery that mature cells can be reprogrammed to become pluripotent\".\n\nAdditionally, several African clawed frogs were present on the Space Shuttle Endeavour (which was launched into space on September 12, 1992) so that scientists could test whether reproduction and development could occur normally in zero gravity.\n\n\"X. laevis\" is also notable for its use in the first widely used method of pregnancy testing, after Lancelot Hogben discovered that the urine from pregnant women induced \"X. laevis\" oocyte production. Human chorionic gonadotropin (HCG) is a hormone found in substantial quantities in the urine of pregnant women. Today, commercially available HCG is injected into \"Xenopus\" males and females to induce mating behavior and to breed these frogs in captivity at any time of the year.\n\nAmphibian frog \"Xenopus laevis\" also serves as an ideal model system for the study of the mechanisms of apoptosis. In fact, iodine and thyroxine stimulate the spectacular apoptosis of the cells of the larval gills, tail and fins in amphibians metamorphosis, and stimulate the evolution of their nervous system transforming the aquatic, vegetarian tadpole into the terrestrial, carnivorous frog.\n\nEarly work on sequencing of the \"X. laevis\" genome was started when the Wallingford and Marcotte labs obtained funding from the Texas Institute for Drug and Diagnostic Development (TI3D), in conjunction with projects funded by the National Institutes of Health. The work rapidly expanded to include \"de novo\" reconstruction of \"X. laevis\" transcripts, in collaboration with groups around the world donating Illumina Hi-Seq RNA sequencing datasets. Genome sequencing by the Rokhsar and Harland groups (UC Berkeley) and by Taira and collaborators (University of Tokyo, Japan) gave a major boost to the project, which, with additional contributions from investigators in the Netherlands, Korea, Canada and Australia, led to publication of the genome sequence and its characterization in 2016.\n\nXenbase is the Model Organism Database (MOD) with the full details and release information regarding the current \"Xenopus laevis\" genome (9.1).\n\n\"Xenopus laevis\" have been kept as pets and research subjects since as early as the 1950s. They are extremely hardy and long lived, having been known to live up to 20 or even 30 years in captivity.\n\nAfrican clawed frogs are frequently mislabeled as African dwarf frogs in pet stores. The astute pet owner will recognize the difference, however, because of the following characteristics:\n\nAfrican clawed frogs are voracious predators and easily adapt to many habitats. For this reason, they can easily become a harmful invasive species. They can travel short distances to other bodies of water, and some have even been documented to survive mild freezes. They have been shown to devastate native populations of frogs and other creatures by eating their young.\n\nIn 2003, \"Xenopus laevis\" frogs were discovered in a pond at San Francisco's Golden Gate Park. Much debate now exists in the area on how to exterminate these creatures and keep them from spreading. It is unknown if these frogs entered the San Francisco ecosystem through intentional release or escape into the wild. San Francisco officials drained Lily Pond and fenced off the area to prevent the frogs from escaping to other ponds in the hopes they starve to death.\n\nDue to incidents in which these frogs were released and allowed to escape into the wild, African clawed frogs are illegal to own, transport or sell without a permit in the following US states: Arizona, California, Kentucky, Louisiana, New Jersey, North Carolina, Oregon, Virginia, Hawaii, Nevada, and Washington state.

{"id": "34460605", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=34460605", "title": "Andersen healthcare utilization model", "text": "Andersen healthcare utilization model\n\nThe Andersen Healthcare Utilization Model - is a conceptual model aimed at demonstrating the factors that lead to the use of health services. According to the model, usage of health services (including inpatient care, physician visits, dental care etc.) is determined by three dynamics: predisposing factors, enabling factors, and need. Predisposing factors can be characteristics such as race, age, and health beliefs. For instance, an individual who believes health services are an effective treatment for an ailment is more likely to seek care. Examples of enabling factors could be family support, access to health insurance, one's community etc. Need represents both perceived and actual need for health care services. The original model was developed by Ronald M. Andersen, a health services professor at UCLA, in 1968. The original model was expanded through numerous iterations and its most recent form models past the use of services to end at health outcomes and includes feedback loops.\n\nA major motivation for the development of the model was to offer measures of access. Andersen discusses four concepts within access that can be viewed through the conceptual framework. Potential access is the presence of enabling resources, allowing the individual to seek care if needed. Realized access is the actual use of care, shown as the outcome of interest in the earlier models. The Andersen framework also makes a distinction between equitable and inequitable access. Equitable access is driven by demographic characteristics and need whereas inequitable access is a result of social structure, health beliefs, and enabling resources.\n\nAndersen also introduces the concept of mutability of his factors. The idea here being that if a concept has a high degree of mutability (can be easily changed) perhaps policy would be justified in using its resources to do rather than a factor with low mutability. Characteristics that fall under demographics are quite difficult to change, however, enabling resources is assigned a high degree of mutability as the individual, community, or national policy can take steps to alter the level of enabling resources for an individual. For example, if the government decides to expand the Medicaid program an individual may experience an increase in enabling resources, which in turn may beget an increase in health services usage. The RAND Health Insurance Experiment (HIE) changed a highly mutable factor, out-of-pocket costs, which greatly changed individual rates of health services usage.\n\nThe initial behavior model was an attempt to study of why a family uses health services. However, due to the heterogeneity of family members the model focused on the individual rather than the family as the unit of analysis. Andersen also states that the model functions both to predict and explain use of health services.\n\nA second model was developed in the 1970s in conjunction with Aday and colleagues at the University of Chicago. This iteration includes systematic concepts of health care such as current policy, resources, and organization. The second generation model also extends the outcome of interest beyond utilization to consumer satisfaction.\n\nThe next generation of the model builds upon this idea by including health status (both perceived and evaluated) as outcomes alongside consumer satisfaction. Furthermore, this model include personal health practices as an antecedent to outcomes, acknowledging that it not solely use of health services that drives health and satisfaction. This model emphasizes a more public health approach of prevention, as advocated by Evans and Stoddart wherein personal health practices (i.e. smoking, diet, exercise) are included as a driving force towards health outcomes.\n\nThe 6th iteration of Andersen’s conceptual framework focuses on the individual as the unit of analysis and goes beyond health care utilization, adopting health outcomes as the endpoint of interest. This model is further differentiated from its predecessors by using a feedback loop to illustrate that health outcomes may affect aspects such as health beliefs, and need. It added genetic susceptibility as a predisposing determinant and quality of life as an outcome By using the framework’s relationships we can determine the directionality of the effect following a change in an individual’s characteristics or environment. For example, if one experiences an increase in need as a result of an infection, the Andersen model predicts this will lead to an increased use of services (all else equal). One potential change for a future iteration of this model is to add genetic information under predisposing characteristics. As genetic information becomes more readily available it seems likely this could impact health services usage, as well as health outcomes, beyond what is already accounted for in the current model.\n\nThe model has been criticized for not paying enough attention to culture and social interaction but Andersen argues this social structure is included in the \"predisposing characteristics\" component. Another criticism was the overemphasis of need and at the expense of health beliefs and social structure. However, Andersen argues need itself is a social construct. This is why need is split into perceived and evaluated. Where evaluated need represents a more measurable/objective need, perceived need is partly determined by health beliefs, such as whether or not people think their condition is serious enough to seek health services. Another limitation of the model is its emphasis on health care utilization or adopting health outcomes as a dichotomous factor, present or not present. Other help-seeking models also consider the type of help source, including informal sources. More recent work has taken help-seeking behaviors further, and more real-world, by including online and other non-face-to-face sources.\n"}

He died during an attempt to climb the Eiger north face with his partner Toni Kurz. A section of the north face was later named the \"Hinterstoisser Traverse\" in his honor. The 2008 film \"North Face\" was based on his experience climbing the Eiger.\n\nAndreas Hinterstoisser was born on 3 October 1914 in Bad Reichenhall, Bavaria, Germany, where he was raised. He worked in a bank before joining the German \"Wehrmacht\" as a professional soldier in 1935. Together with his childhood friend Toni Kurz, he made numerous first ascents of peaks in the Berchtesgaden Alps, including some of the most difficult climbs of that time. The two young men climbed the southwest wall of the Berchtesgadener Hochthron in 1934, and the south wall of the straight pillar in 1936. They also made first ascents in the Reiter Alpe on the German–Austrian border, and of the direct southern route up the Watzmannkinder in the Watzmann in 1935.\n\nIn 1936 he formed part of a four-man team making the second attempt to scale the north face of the Eiger. He was renowned as one of the best rock climbers of his time and is held in high esteem to this day. He cleverly traversed a slab of icy rock, a feat which made the rest of the attempt on the Eiger possible, by climbing up on it and lowering himself to execute a pendulum to the other side, securing a rope and enabling his companions to cross the impassable section. This move became known as the \"Hinterstoisser Traverse\".\nDuring a retreat from the wall, due both to an injury suffered by one of his comrades and to the severe weather, Hinterstoisser could not recross the traverse to safety because the group had previously removed the rope that had helped them across. The group decided to abseil down the vertical face (the great rock barrier) to the base of the mountain. Contact was made with a railway guard halfway down the descent during which the climbers called back that everything was all right (perhaps from pride and the knowledge that they were close to safety). However, as Hinterstoisser set up the last stage of the descent an avalanche came down the mountain, wiping out Hinterstoisser, who had unclipped from the group. He fell to his death and was found at the bottom of the mountain days later. The rest of the group suffered the same fate: Willy Angerer was killed by the impact; Edi Rainer was asphyxiated from the weight of the rope holding his comrades; and Toni Kurz died from exposure, despite having made contact with rescuers.\n\nThe tragic story became well known after publication of Heinrich Harrer's classic 1960 book \"The White Spider\" and was more recently covered by Joe Simpson's book (and Emmy-winning TV documentary), \"The Beckoning Silence\", as well as the 2008 German dramatic movie \"North Face\".\n\n"}

{"id": "3840", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=3840", "title": "Brain abscess", "text": "Brain abscess\n\nBrain abscess (or cerebral abscess) is an abscess caused by inflammation and collection of infected material, coming from local (ear infection, dental abscess, infection of paranasal sinuses, infection of the mastoid air cells of the temporal bone, epidural abscess) or remote (lung, heart, kidney etc.) infectious sources, within the brain tissue. The infection may also be introduced through a skull fracture following a head trauma or surgical procedures. Brain abscess is usually associated with congenital heart disease in young children. It may occur at any age but is most frequent in the third decade of life.\n\nFever, headache, and neurological problems, while classic, only occur in 20% of people with brain abscess.\n\nThe famous triad of fever, headache and focal neurologic findings are highly suggestive of brain abscess. These symptoms are caused by a combination of increased intracranial pressure due to a space-occupying lesion (headache, vomiting, confusion, coma), infection (fever, fatigue etc.) and focal neurologic brain tissue damage (hemiparesis, aphasia etc.). \n\nThe most frequent presenting symptoms are headache, drowsiness, confusion, seizures, hemiparesis or speech difficulties together with fever with a rapidly progressive course. Headache is characteristically worse at night and in the morning, as the intracranial pressure naturally increases when in the supine position. This elevation similarly stimulates the medullary vomiting center and area postrema, leading to morning vomiting. \n\nOther symptoms and findings depend largely on the specific location of the abscess in the brain. An abscess in the cerebellum, for instance, may cause additional complaints as a result of brain stem compression and hydrocephalus. Neurological examination may reveal a stiff neck in occasional cases (erroneously suggesting meningitis).\n\nAnaerobic and microaerophilic cocci and gram-negative and gram-positive anaerobic bacilli are the predominate bacterial isolates. Many brain abscesses are polymicrobical. The predominant organisms include: \"Staphylococcus aureus\", aerobic and anaerobic streptococci (especially \"Streptococcus intermedius\"), \"Bacteroides\", \"Prevotella\", and \"Fusobacterium\" species, Enterobacteriaceae, \"Pseudomonas\" species, and other anaerobes. Less common organisms include: \"Haemophillus influenzae\", \"Streptococcus pneumoniae\" and \"Neisseria meningitides\".\n\nBacterial abscesses rarely (if ever) arise \"de novo\" within the brain, although establishing a cause can be difficult in many cases. There is almost always a primary lesion elsewhere in the body that must be sought assiduously, because failure to treat the primary lesion will result in relapse. In cases of trauma, for example in compound skull fractures where fragments of bone are pushed into the substance of the brain, the cause of the abscess is obvious. Similarly, bullets and other foreign bodies may become sources of infection if left in place. The location of the primary lesion may be suggested by the location of the abscess: infections of the middle ear result in lesions in the middle and posterior cranial fossae; congenital heart disease with right-to-left shunts often result in abscesses in the distribution of the middle cerebral artery; and infection of the frontal and ethmoid sinuses usually results in collection in the subdural sinuses.\n\nFungi and parasites may also cause the disease. Fungi and parasites are especially associated with immunocompromised patients. Other causes include: \"Nocardia asteroides\", \"Mycobacterium\", Fungi (e.g. \"Aspergillus\", \"Candida\", \"Cryptococcus\", \"Mucorales\", \"Coccidioides\", \"Histoplasma capsulatum\", \"Blastomyces dermatitidis\", \"Bipolaris\", \"Exophiala dermatitidis\", \"Curvularia pallescens\", \"Ochroconis gallopava\", \"Ramichloridium mackenziei\", \"Pseudallescheria boydii\"), Protozoa (e.g. \"Toxoplasma gondii\", \"Entamoeba histolytica\", \"Trypanosoma cruzi\", \"Schistosoma\", \"Paragonimus\"), and Helminths (e.g. \"Taenia solium\"). Organisms that are most frequently associated with brain abscess in patients with AIDS are poliovirus, \"Toxoplasma gondii\", and \"Cryptococcus neoformans\", though in infection with the latter organism, symptoms of meningitis generally predominate.\n\nThese organisms are associated with certain predisposing conditions: \n\nThe diagnosis is established by a computed tomography (CT) (with contrast) examination. At the initial phase of the inflammation (which is referred to as cerebritis), the immature lesion does not have a capsule and it may be difficult to distinguish it from other space-occupying lesions or infarcts of the brain. Within 4–5 days the inflammation and the concomitant dead brain tissue are surrounded with a capsule, which gives the lesion the famous ring-enhancing lesion appearance on CT examination with contrast (since intravenously applied contrast material can not pass through the capsule, it is collected around the lesion and looks as a ring surrounding the relatively dark lesion). Lumbar puncture procedure, which is performed in many infectious disorders of the central nervous system is contraindicated in this condition (as it is in all space-occupying lesions of the brain) because removing a certain portion of the cerebrospinal fluid may alter the concrete intracranial pressure balances and causes the brain tissue to move across structures within the skull (brain herniation).\n\nRing enhancement may also be observed in cerebral hemorrhages (bleeding) and some brain tumors. However, in the presence of the rapidly progressive course with fever, focal neurologic findings (hemiparesis, aphasia etc.) and signs of increased intracranial pressure, the most likely diagnosis should be the brain abscess.\n\nThe treatment includes lowering the increased intracranial pressure and starting intravenous antibiotics (and meanwhile identifying the causative organism mainly by blood culture studies).\n\nHyperbaric oxygen therapy (HBO2 or HBOT) is indicated as a primary and adjunct treatment which provides four primary functions.\nFirstly, HBOT reduces intracranial pressure. Secondly, high partial pressures of oxygen act as a bactericide and thus inhibits the anaerobic and functionally anaerobic flora common in brain abscess. Third, HBOT optimizes the immune function thus enhancing the host defense mechanisms and fourth, HBOT has been found to be of benefit when brain abscess is concomitant with cranial osteomyleitis.\n\nSecondary functions of HBOT include increased stem cell production and up-regulation of VEGF which aid in the healing and recovery process.\n\nSurgical drainage of the abscess remains part of the standard management of bacterial brain abscesses. The location and treatment of the primary lesion also crucial, as is the removal of any foreign material (bone, dirt, bullets, and so forth).\n\nThere are few exceptions to this rule: \"Haemophilus influenzae\" meningitis is often associated with subdural effusions that are mistaken for subdural empyemas. These effusions resolve with antibiotics and require no surgical treatment. Tuberculosis can produce brain abscesses that look identical to conventional bacterial abscesses on CT imaging. Surgical drainage or aspiration is often necessary to identify \"Mycobacterium tuberculosis\", but once the diagnosis is made no further surgical intervention is necessary.\n\nCT guided stereotactic aspiration is also indicated in the treatment of brain abscess. The use of pre-operative imaging, intervention with post-operative clinical and biochemical monitoring used to manage brain abscesses today dates back to the Pennybacker system pioneered by Somerset, Kentucky-born neurosurgeon Joseph Buford Pennybacker, director of the neurosurgery department of the Radcliffe Infirmary, Oxford from 1952 to 1971. \n\nWhile death occurs in about 10% of cases, people do well about 70% of the time. This is a large improvement from the 1960s due to improved ability to image the head, better neurosurgery and better antibiotics.\n\n"}

It takes into account the type of radiation and the nature of each organ or tissue being irradiated, and enables summation of organ doses due to varying levels and types of radiation, both internal and external, to produce an overall calculated effective dose.\n\nThe SI unit for effective dose is the sievert (Sv) which represents a 5.5% chance of developing cancer. The effective dose is not intended as a measure of \"deterministic\" health effects, which is the \"severity\" of acute tissue damage that is certain to happen, that is measured by the quantity absorbed dose.\n\nThe concept of effective dose was developed by Wolfgang Jacobi and published in 1975, and was so convincing that the ICRP incorporated it into their 1977 general recommendations (publication 26) as \"effective dose equivalent\". The name \"effective dose\" replaced the name \"effective dose equivalent\" in 1991. Since 1977 it has been the central quantity for dose limitation in the ICRP international system of radiological protection.\n\nAccording to the ICRP, the main uses of effective dose are the prospective dose assessment for planning and optimisation in radiological protection, and demonstration of compliance with dose limits for regulatory purposes. The effective dose is thus a central dose quantity for regulatory purposes.\n\nThe ICRP also says that effective dose has made a significant contribution to radiological protection as it has enabled doses to be summed from whole and partial body exposure from external radiation of various types and from intakes of radionuclides.\n\nThe calculation of effective dose is required for partial or non-uniform irradiation of the human body because equivalent dose does not consider the tissue irradiated, but only the radiation type. Various body tissues react to ionising radiation in different ways, so the ICRP has assigned sensitivity factors to specified tissues and organs so that the effect of partial irradiation can be calculated if the irradiated regions are known. A radiation field irradiating only a portion of the body will carry lower risk than if the same field irradiated the whole body. To take this into account, the effective doses to the component parts of the body which have been irradiated are calculated and summed. This becomes the effective dose for the whole body, dose quantity \"E\". It is a \"protection\" dose quantity which can be calculated, but cannot be measured in practice.\n\nAn effective dose will carry the same effective risk to the whole body regardless of where it was applied, and it will carry the same effective risk as the same amount of equivalent dose applied uniformly to the whole body.\n\nEffective dose can be calculated for committed dose which is the internal dose resulting from inhaling, ingesting, or injecting radioactive materials. \n\nThe dose quantity used is:\n\nCommitted effective dose, E(\"t\") is the sum of the products of the committed organ or tissue equivalent doses and the appropriate tissue weighting factors \"W\", where \"t\" is the integration time in years following the intake. The commitment period is taken to be 50 years for adults, and to age 70 years for children.\n\nIonizing radiation deposits energy in the matter being irradiated. The quantity used to express this is the absorbed dose, a physical dose quantity that is dependent on the level of incident radiation and the absorption properties of the irradiated object. Absorbed dose is a physical quantity, and is not a satisfactory indicator of biological effect, so to allow consideration of the stochastic radiological risk, the dose quantities equivalent dose and effective dose were devised by the International Commission on Radiation Units and Measurements (ICRU) and the ICRP to calculate the biological effect of an absorbed dose.\n\nTo obtain an effective dose, the calculated absorbed organ dose \"D\" is first corrected for the radiation type using factor \"W\" to give a weighted average of the equivalent dose quantity \"H\" received in irradiated body tissues, and the result is further corrected for the tissues or organs being irradiated using factor \"W\", to produce the effective dose quantity \"E\".\n\nThe sum of effective doses to all organs and tissues of the body represents the effective dose for the whole body. If only part of the body is irradiated, then only those regions are used to calculate the effective dose. The tissue weighting factors summate to 1.0, so that if an entire body is radiated with uniformly penetrating external radiation, the effective dose for the entire body is equal to the equivalent dose for the entire body.\n\nThe ICRP tissue weighting factors are given in the accompanying table, and the equations used to calculate from either absorbed dose or equivalent dose are also given.\n\nSome tissues like bone marrow are particularly sensitive to radiation, so they are given a weighting factor that is disproportionally large relative to the fraction of body mass they represent. Other tissues like the hard bone surface are particularly insensitive to radiation and are assigned a disproportionally low weighting factor.\n\nCalculating from the equivalent dose:\n\nCalculating from the absorbed dose:\n\nWhere\n\nThe ICRP tissue weighting factors are chosen to represent the fraction of health risk, or biological effect, which is attributable to the specific tissue named. These weighting factors have been revised twice, as shown in the chart above.\n\nThe US Nuclear Regulatory Commission still endorses the ICRP's 1977 tissue weighting factors in their regulations, in spite of the ICRP's later revised recommendations.\n\nIonizing radiation is generally harmful and potentially lethal to living things but can have health benefits in radiation therapy for the treatment of cancer and thyrotoxicosis. Its most common impact is the induction of cancer with a latent period of years or decades after exposure. High doses can cause visually dramatic radiation burns, and/or rapid fatality through acute radiation syndrome. Controlled doses are used for medical imaging and radiotherapy. \n\nThe UK Ionising Radiations Regulations 1999 defines its usage of the term effective dose; \"Any reference to an effective dose means the sum of the effective dose to the whole body from external radiation and the committed effective dose from internal radiation.\"\n\nThe US Nuclear Regulatory Commission has retained in the US regulation system the older term effective dose equivalent to refer to a similar quantity to the ICRP effective dose. The NRC's total effective dose equivalent (TEDE) is the sum of external effective dose with internal committed dose; in other words all sources of dose.\n\nIn the US, cumulative equivalent dose due to external whole-body exposure is normally reported to nuclear energy workers in regular dosimetry reports.\n\n\nThe concept of effective dose was introduced in 1975 by Wolfgang Jacobi (1928–2015) in his publication \"The concept of an effective dose: a proposal for the combination of organ doses\". It was quickly included in 1977 as “effective dose equivalent” into Publication 26 by the ICRP. In 1991, ICRP publication 60 shortened the name to \"effective dose.\" This quantity is sometimes incorrectly referred to as the \"dose equivalent\" because of the earlier name, and that misnomer in turn causes confusion with equivalent dose. The tissue weighting factors were revised in 1990 and 2007 due to new data.\n\nAt the ICRP 3rd International Symposium on the System of Radiological Protection in October 2015, ICRP Task Group 79 reported on the \"Use of Effective Dose as a Risk-related Radiological Protection Quantity\".\n\nThis included a proposal to discontinue use of equivalent dose as a separate protection quantity. This would avoid confusion between equivalent dose, effective dose and dose equivalent, and to use absorbed dose in Gy as a more appropriate quantity for limiting deterministic effects to the eye lens, skin, hands & feet.\n\nIt was also proposed that effective dose could be used as a rough indicator of possible risk from medical examinations. These proposals will need to go through the following stages:\n\n\n an account of chronological differences between USA and ICRP dosimetry systems\n"}

Angell\n\nEmerson Colon Angell (1822-1903) was an American Dentist who is known as the father of the rapid maxillary expansion. He published a paper in Dental Cosmos in 1860 in which he described this technique.\n\nHe was born and grew up in Scituate, Rhode Island. He was the 7th generation of his family from Rhode Island. He was descendant of Thomas Angell. Emerson learned agriculture and mechanics from his father. He began studying dentistry in 1846 under mentorship of people in the community due to the lack of any formal education available at that time. He eventually practiced in Rhode Island, New York City and San Francisco.\n\nEmerson first published a paper on expansion of palate in San Francisco Medical Press (SFMP) in January 1960. This initial paper described the expansion of palate with deciduous teeth which was later followed by another paper on the permanent teeth dentition in SFMP. His first paper was a case report which focused on a 14-year-old patient with a posterior Crossbite. Emerson fitted this patient with an appliance in his maxillary arch and gave patients instructions to turn screw everyday. Emerson claimed that expansion was achieved in 2 weeks by separation of maxilla along the Midpalatal suture . Dr. Angell faced much criticism from people in the field of dentistry at that point.\n"}

At this time, it was recognized that clearly the medical profession had an important role to play if the philosophy of the Health For All (HFA) movement in general and the European regional HFA targets in particular were to be achieved. Further meetings involving national medical associations, both from the West and East, took place in 1986, 1987 and 1988. At a meeting in Rome in 1990, the national medical associations recognised that they had created a permanent forum permitting a fruitful dialogue with WHO. This was formalized at Helsinki in 1991 when the aims of the Forum were finalized as follows:\n\n\"The aims of the Forum shall be, by establishing a dialogue and cooperation between National Medical Associations and the WHO Regional Office for the European Region, to:\n\na) improve the quality of health and health care in Europe;\nb) promote the exchange of information and ideas between national medical associations, and between the associations and the World Health Organization;\nc) integrate appropriate aspects of policies of Health for All into basic, postgraduate and continuing medical education; and\nd) formulate consensus policy statements on health issues.\"\n\nFor the purposes of membership, a national medical association is defined as a free independent nongovernmental association of physicians constituted in an organization, which elect its own officers, appoints its own staff and determines its own constitution, except for any statutory duties that it undertakes, and whose activities cover all the various aspects of professional practice.\n\nWith the changes in the eastern part of the region during the 1990s, there was a need for special dialogue between the countries of the east of the region and those in the west. In Budapest (1994), London (1995) and Stockholm (1996) post-Forum meetings were held for the benefit of the newly emerging and re-establishing national medical associations from this part of the region. In 1997, this was merged with the main meeting and devoted to a discussion on health care reform, based on the 1996 WHO Ljubljana Charter on Reforming Health Care.\n\nIn the annual meetings of the Forum, representatives from medical associations in around 40 countries are represented. Observers have included the Canadian Medical Association, which has attended regularly, and a number of Pan-European medical associations.\n\nEach year, national medical associations report not only on their general activities but also on any action they have taken in areas which the Forum has considered. A handbook is updated annually containing information about the constitution, activities and officers of participating national medical associations.\n\nFrom the beginning, the problems of tobacco and smoking and the subject of continuing medical education have been subjects of continuing report and action and, starting in Sofia in 1988, the quality of care. The meetings have considered a spectrum of subjects including AIDS, new patterns of infectious diseases, health care in the elderly, health promotion, the rights of patients, the physician’s role in environmental health, financing of health care, development of new health care systems, suicide in the young, quality of care development, use/misuse/abuse of drugs, medical education, health care in prisons, and eHealth.\n\nOver the years, the Forum has adopted a number of declarations, statements and recommendations. Some of these statements have been followed up by establishing action groups, notably in relation to tobacco and to the quality of care, in order to assist national medical associations in carrying forward appropriate action in their own countries.\n\nA meeting of the Forum is organized once a year (normally March or April), to review developments relevant to the medical profession and to exchange experience.\n\nIn 2006, the meeting was held in Budapest, hosted by the Hungarian Medical Association, and in 2007 in Lisbon, hosted by the Portuguese Medical Association. On 7 September 2007, EFMA Liaison Committee took place in Yerevan, Armenia, hosted by the Armenian Medical Association. The annual meeting in 2008 took place in Israel on 10–11 April 2008 and was hosted by the Israel Medical Association. In 2012, EFMA meeting was hosted by the Armenian Medical Association and took place on 19–20 April 2012 in Yerevan, Armenia. In addition to Health 2020, the financial crisis, social determinants of health and policies on alcohol were on the agenda.\n\nParticipants at the annual meetings comprise representatives from the various medical associations, as well as observers from other associations and organizations in Europe e.g. the World Medical Association (WMA), the Standing Committee of European Doctors, Comité permanent des médecins européens (CPME), Permanent Working Group of European Junior Doctors (PWG), European Union of General Practitioners (UEMO), European Medical Students' Association (EMSA), European Working Group of Practitioners and Specialists in Free Practice (E.A.N.A.), European Federation of Salaried Doctors (FEMS), European Association of Senior Hospital Physicians (A.E.M.H.).\n\n\n"}

In his book \"1940–1945, The Erotic Years: Vichy, or, the Misfortunes of Virtue\" Patrick Buisson talks about “erotic shock ... or exploring new territories of pleasure.\" After the occupation he writes about French prisoners bedding local German girls, while back in their homeland French women had intimate relations with their German occupiers. Local cinemas and even subway stations became anonymous locations for physical trysts during Allied bombings. After Allied liberation any woman who had a reputation for associating with the Germans were targeted as collaborators and faced hazing or worse.\n\nThe German birth rate, like that in most industrial nations, had been falling for decades. When Hitler and the Nazi Party took power in 1933 they implemented several revolutionary policies in order to change the sexual practices of the German people and reverse this slide in birth rates. At the same time that it forbade the mixing of Jewish and German through the Nuremberg Laws, the Nazi government tried a number of policies designed to increase new births. One action was to change the marriage laws via the 1938 divorce-reform law by the Minister of Justice, Franz Gürtner. Within two years 30,000 divorces were filed, 80% of which were husbands casting off women over 45 years old. While the divorce law increased new marriages and children from these marriages, the Nazis looked to illegitimate births in Germany as a way to increase Germany's birthrate.\n\nIn the 1920s there were about 150,000 illegitimate births in Germany, before halving during the depression and bouncing up to 100,000 in 1935. The Nazis wanted to increase the illegitimate births by encouraging out of wedlock births, especially those of Aryan heritage. Part official policy, part propaganda, the Nazi policy manifested itself in the Lebensborn program. The Lebensborn program provided a place where pregnant mothers could have their babies out of wedlock in secret.\n\nOnly the most \"pure\" of its applicants were chosen to join its programs. Of all the women who applied, only 40 percent passed the racial purity test (they had to show their family tree three generations back) and were granted admission to the Lebensborn program. The majority of mothers were unmarried, 57.6 percent until 1939, and about 70 percent by 1940.\n\nThe Lebensborn program was given a further push when Himmler issued a proclamation that every SS soldier should father a child before he left for war. The child could then be born and raised at the Lebensborn facilities. Through these policies the birth rate increased and Himmler told his doctor Kerstern how proud he was to have a role in the change, \"Only a few years ago illegitimate children were considered a shameful matter ... [now] my men tell me with shining eyes that a son has been born to them. Their girls consider it an honour, not a source of shame.\" \n\nOnce World War II broke out and men were sent to the front, the Nazis changed their promise of \"every woman will have a man\" to \"every woman will have a child\". A report to the Ministry of Justice in 1944 stated that:\n\nLeaders of the [League of German Girls have] intimated to their girls that they should bear illegitimate children; these leaders have pointed out that in view of the prevailing shortage of men, not every girl could expect to get a husband in future, and that the girls should at least fulfil their task as German women and donate a child to the Führer.\nAs a mark of how much sexual attitudes had changed by the end of the war, 23% of all young Germans were infected with a venereal disease, and prostitution had quadrupled, including male and female prostitution, as the allies were many times more willing to have sexual relations with a male who could not get pregnant. A number of scandals including males caught naked/sexually involved caused some of the male prostitutes to be shipped to smaller towns or islands, where they were the majority of men there and they caused many families to breakup, given their peculiar proclivity to maintain a strong sexual identity with males they had found in smaller towns. Often, this was the consequence of rape by Allied soldiers or the harsh living conditions which drove huge numbers of starving Germans into prostitution just to survive.\n\nHad the Germans triumphed, Himmler and Bormann were considering a post-war institution of double marriage for Nazi party officials and war heroes.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "30673492", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=30673492", "title": "Experiential avoidance", "text": "Experiential avoidance\n\nExperiential avoidance (EA) has been broadly defined as attempts to avoid thoughts, feelings, memories, physical sensations, and other internal experiences—even when doing so creates harm in the long-run. The process of EA is thought to be maintained through negative reinforcement—that is, short-term relief of discomfort is achieved through avoidance, thereby increasing the likelihood that the behavior will persist. Importantly, the current conceptualization of EA suggests that it is not negative thoughts, emotions, and sensations that are problematic, but how one responds to them that can cause difficulties. In particular, a habitual and persistent unwillingness to experience uncomfortable thoughts and feelings (and the associated avoidance and inhibition of these experiences) is thought to be linked to a wide range of problems.\n\nEA has been popularized by recent third-wave cognitive-behavioral theories such as acceptance and commitment therapy (ACT). However, the general concept has roots in many other theories of psychopathology and intervention.\n\nDefense mechanisms were originally conceptualized as ways to avoid unpleasant affect and discomfort that resulted from conflicting motivations. These processes were thought to contribute to the expression of various types of psychopathology. Gradual removal of these defensive processes are thought to be a key aspect of treatment and eventually return to psychological health.\n\nProcess-experiential therapy merges client-centered, existential, and Gestalt approaches. Gestalt theory outlines the benefits of being fully aware of and open to one's entire experience. One job of the psychotherapist is to \"explore and become fully aware of [the patient's] grounds for avoidance\" and to \"[lead] the patient back to that which he wishes to avoid\" (p. 142). Similar ideas are expressed by early humanistic theory: \"Whether the stimulus was the impact of a configuration of form, color, or sound in the environment on the sensory nerves, or a memory trace from the past, or a visceral sensation of fear or pleasure or disgust, the person would be 'living' it, would have it completely available to awareness…he is more open to his feelings of fear and discouragement and pain...he is more able fully to live the experiences of his organism rather than shutting them out of awareness.\"\n\nTraditional behavior therapy utilizes exposure to habituate the patient to various types of fears and anxieties, eventually resulting in a marked reduction in psychopathology. In this way, exposure can be thought of as \"counter-acting\" avoidance, in that it involves individuals repeatedly encountering and remaining in contact with that which causes distress and discomfort.\n\nIn cognitive theory, avoidance interferes with reappraisals of negative thought patterns and schema, thereby perpetuating distorted beliefs. These distorted beliefs are thought to contribute and maintain many types of psychopathology.\n\nThe concept of EA is explicitly described and targeted in more recent CBT modalities including acceptance and commitment therapy (ACT), dialectical behavior therapy (DBT), functional analytic psychotherapy (FAP), and behavioral activation (BA).\n\n\n\nSeemingly disparate forms of pathological behavior can be understood by their common function (i.e., attempts to avoid distress). Some examples include:\n\nPerhaps the most significant impact of EA is its potential to disrupt and interfere with important, valued aspects of an individual's life. That is, EA is seen as particularly problematic when it occurs at the expense of a person's deeply held values. Some examples include:\n\n\nThe Acceptance and Action Questionnaire (AAQ) was the first self-report measure explicitly designed to measure EA, but has since been re-conceptualized as a measure of \"psychological flexibility\". The Multidimensional Experiential Avoidance Questionnaire (MEAQ) was developed to measure different aspects of EA.\n\n\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "51285707", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=51285707", "title": "Family-centered practices", "text": "Family-centered practices\n\nFamily-centered practices (FCPs) use a variety of different tools for child development, where the development, provision, and assessment of healthcare is equally constructive to both children and their families. FCP is valuable to clients of all children and can be applied in many different healthcare settings.\n\nFCP uses different types of implementations such as intervention planning, providing learning opportunities and information, teaching interaction skills, delivering family therapy sessions, and teaching non-judgment and the positives of non-judgment. To make FCPs successful, it is important to learn about the family system and to properly assess the intervention that respects the participating family.\n\nFamily centered practices can be used for many different situations. They can be used for cases such as child abuse and/or neglect. Using the FCP approach may be difficult in the case of caregivers who do not see a need for change. When trials of family centered practices were used by the Washington State Social and Health Services, 6% of all participants were deemed to have success and see change. In those trials, circumstances, where children had been removed from their home and placed into another home (i.e. foster care or group home), were taken into account.\n\nThe idea of FCP came from Dr John Sullivan, at the Institute for Family Centered Services. Sullivan's goal was to show families that they were important and influential in a child's life. Interventions were designed to assist families in degrading situations. Participants were taught positive peer culture, and the importance of each individual's dignity, respect, and skill. The first participants were brought to the attention of John Sullivan from the Juvenile Justice system. After success was shown, the Family and Children's Social Services began to participate. By 1989, there were multiple organizations using FCP techniques. By the 2000s, the practice had spread to nearly every U.S. state and the idea became a normal intervention in the lives of troubled, abused, neglected, and maltreated children and their families.\n\nFCP focuses on the family as the primary unit of attention while encouraging strength, respect, and support within the family. Instructors are most often social workers. They begin their work by evaluating the family with the child/children and the family without the child/children. The goal from the evaluation is to build consistent, ethical, and effective child welfare practice within the family. Once the evaluation step is complete, the instructor focuses on building a program in conjunction with the family, rather than simply dictating one. This ensures that the caregivers maintain authority, and improves program results. The program concludes after a set period of time, that is usually set by the court or social worker, depending on the severity of the child's case.\n\nIn developed countries, such as Australia, most hospital settings claim to be family-centered. This means the hospitals have implemented an attitude where they believe that parents are essential to their child's well-being, and therefore crucial to the decision-making process regarding their health.\n\nAfter consultations with FCPs, the results in families differ, as no two families are the same. Each family has its own beliefs and values, which the social worker must take into account while helping create a program designed for them. After the evaluation step, if the social worker was able to find out the severity of the child's maltreatment, the goal has been met. Even if use of an FCP is not continued, other steps can be taken to provide for the safety and well-being of the child.\n\n\n"}

Rush's paper at the time was the first challenge to Freudian theories of children as the seducers of adults rather than the victims of adults' sexual/power exploitation.\n\nRush was born to Russian immigrants in Manhattan and grew up in the Bronx, NY before moving to New Rochelle, NY. She subsequently moved to Manhattan's Greenwich Village in the early 1970s. She was married to Bernard Rush and is survived by son, Thomas, his two children, and daughter, Eleanor. In 2005, she was honored with the New York City NOW's Chapter Susan B. Anthony Award to grassroots feminists.\n\nRush observed the problem of childhood sexual abuse as a psychiatric social worker at the New York Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children and at a facility for delinquent female adolescents, although at the time—during the 1950s and 1960s—such therapists were instructed to avoid discussing incest with their young patients because of prevailing Freudian theories.\n\nRush's NYRF Rape Conference presentation about incest and childhood sexual abuse reviewed psychiatric and psychoanalytical literature from Freud to that time that attributed such problems to children's seduction of adults or erotic fantasies. She then linked these prevailing psychiatric theories about the child's instigation of or erotic fantasies about incest and sexual abuse to maintaining a climate for the political and psychological oppression of women. As Rush concluded in her presentation the \"sexual abuse of children..is an unspoken but prominent factor in socializing and preparing the female to accept a subordinate role: to feel guilty, ashamed, and to tolerate through fear, the power exercised over her by men.\" \n\nRush subsequently authored the 1977 \"Freud and the Sexual Abuse of Children\" in the first volume of a feminist theory journal, \"Chyrsalis\", and the 1980 Prentice Hall \"The Best Kept Secret: The Sexual Abuse of Children\" that additionally traced the toleration of sexual abuse of children to the beginnings of history. Her continued work to counter sexual abuse of women and children and the media imagery feminists believe propagates such abuse encompassed key roles in many organizations. She served as 1979 co-founder and 1979-1987 lecturer for Women Against Pornography, 1980–1985 chair of the National Organization for Women (NOW)'s New York City Chapter's Media Reform Committee, Board of Directors Member of New York Women Against Rape where she produced and exhibited a slide presentation on the increasing media eroticism of children, and member of the New York State Psychiatric Institute's Advisory Committee on the Treatment of Sexual Aggressors.\n\nRush was an early participant in the second wave of U.S. feminism when, in 1970, she became co-founder and steering committee member of Older Women's Liberation (OWL). She was to conclude her feminist work between 2002 and 2005 as chair of New York City NOW's Older Women's Committee where she organized against Republican presidential and congressional efforts to reduce budget deficits by reining in Social Security and Medicare benefit costs.\n\nRush was also concerned about women's role definitions and expectations within families as author of \"Women in the Middle\", the first article about sandwich generation women taking care of both children and elderly relatives, published in \"Notes from the Third Year\" and \"Radical Feminism\" In the mid-1970s she produced and exhibited a slide show presentation \"From Mother Goddess to Father Knows Best\" about the depreciation of mothers from ancient mythology to 20th century media representations. As a mother struggling with the role of caretaker to her son, Matthew, and his lover, Ron, when they became ill with AIDS in 1987, Rush's organizing around feminist issues extended to mothers of AIDS patients as an active participant in a mothers' support group of the People With AIDS Coalition of New York After Matthew and Ron died in 1990, she founded and participated in the first Bereavement Group for such mothers.\n\nIn 1977, Rush became an associate of the Women's Institute for Freedom of the Press (WIFP). WIFP is an American nonprofit publishing organization. The organization works to increase communication between women and connect the public with forms of women-based media.\n"}

This paraphilia often involves the application of insects to the genitals, but other areas of the body may also be the focus. The desired effect may be a tickling, stinging or in the case of slugs, slimy sensation, or the infliction of psychological distress on another person. The term was coined by Ratnin Dewaraja and John Money in 1986 from the Latin \"formica\" (ant) + the Greek \"philia\" (love).\n\nIn the first reported case study, the patient had started keeping ants in a cupboard of his room as a hobby when he was nine. At this age he enjoyed \"the ticklish feeling\" of the ants crawling on his legs and thighs. At age ten, he had a sexual relationship with another boy, and was beaten when his father discovered this. By the age of 13 or 14, he had added snails and cockroaches to his collection, and was becoming increasingly preoccupied with it. He had begun masturbating while the ants crawled on his legs. At age 28, he was masturbating several times a week while cockroaches crawled on his thighs and testicles, and snails crawled over his nipples and penis. Sometimes he would hold a frog against his penis and enjoy the vibrations as it tried to escape. The patient was disgusted by his habit, but derived no pleasure from normal sexual activities. John Money suggested that the paraphilia developed as an alternative outlet after his normal sexual expression became associated with the trauma of his father's punishment.\n\nAnother case was described in 2012. At the age of 14, the patient saw an ice-cream stick covered with ants, and wondered how it would feel if his penis was in place of the stick. He began letting ants crawl on his genitals, especially fire ants, a practice he found sexually exciting and that continued into adulthood. The patient was socially and intellectually competent.

{"id": "36245312", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=36245312", "title": "Horse burial", "text": "Horse burial\n\nHorse burial is the practice of burying a horse as part of the ritual of human burial, and is found among many Indo-European peoples and others, including Chinese and Turkic peoples. The act indicates the high value placed on horses in the particular cultures and provides evidence of the migration of peoples with a horse culture. Human burials that contain other livestock are rare; in Britain, for example, 31 horse burials have been discovered but only one cow burial, unique in Europe. This process of horse burial is part of a wider tradition of horse sacrifice. An associated ritual is that of chariot burial, in which an entire chariot, with or without a horse, is buried with a dead person.\n\nThe horse carries great symbolic meaning in human cultures (see horse worship). In Celtic and Germanic cultures, for instance, the horse \"could be associated with the journeying sun\", and horses were deified and used in divination, but Celtic horse sacrifice is rare whereas horses were regularly sacrificed and buried alongside dead humans in Germany and Scandinavia. The Indo-European ubiquity and importance of horse sacrifice (which in many cases involves a symbolic coupling between king and mare) attests to this importance.\n\nConsiderable differences exist between different horse burials even within a single area and culture, so much so that it is perhaps impossible to generalize. Sometimes horses were cremated, sometimes buried; sometimes they were placed in the same grave as humans, sometimes in a different pit; some cultures appear to favor horse burial for male warriors, others did not seem to differentiate in gender.\n\nThe practice of horse burial is bound to the historical territory covered by the domesticated horse, which initially was the Eurasian Steppe, ca. 4000–3500 BCE. Early cultures with a mythology that would support horse burial are those in or bordering those areas—Turkic cultures, Chinese cultures, and Indo-European cultures.\nIt is claimed that a form of horse burial is attested from the Paleolithic, when the skin of a horse was hung over a pole; some of the animal's bones were left inside the skin to preserve its shape. This supposed \"head and hooves\" culture, however, is only one explanation for archeological finds from the third millennium BCE. The earliest proven horse burial in the Old World dates back to the fifth or fourth millennium BC and is found in Sezzhee, in a cemetery on the Volga from the Samara culture. Thousands of years later, Herodotus described the practice among the Scythians. Typically, such burials involved the sacrifice and burial of one or more horses to accompany the remains of high-ranked members or warriors. In China, horse burials (including chariots) are found beginning in the Shang Dynasty (1600–1100 BCE). Remains of the ritual are found in Kazakh culture, where a dead person's horse is slaughtered a year after its owner's death, in a ceremony accompanied by horse races. Horse burial and related rituals survived among other peoples as well into recent times, for instance among the Nez Perce people (where skinned and stuffed horses were used as grave monuments) and the Blackfoot Confederacy.\n\nSites featuring horse burials are found throughout the regions of the world occupied by Indo-Aryan, Turkic, and Chinese peoples. They include Tall al-Ajjul (Gaza strip, dating back to 2100 BC), Central Iran, where horse burials are attested in the second millennium BC, Marlik (in Iran, from the late second millennium BCE), and Gordium (in Phrygia, with horse burials attested possibly after 700 BCE). A horse burial from Bactria provides evidence of the migration in the second millennium BCE of horse cultures from Central Asia into Turkmenistan. A horse burial in Tell el-Dab'a, Egypt, evidences the introduction of the horse to Egypt by the Hyksos, in the Second Intermediate Period of Egypt (1650–1550 BCE).\n\nA nomad's kurgan burial of around 700 BCE at Kostromskaya in southern Russia included, as well as the principal male body with his accoutrements, thirteen humans with no adornment above him, and around the edges of the burial twenty-two horses buried in pairs. Horse burials are part of the Pazyryk burials, where lavishly decked-out horses were killed and sometimes buried in chambers separate from those containing human remains. They were characteristic in pre-Christian Hungary (one horse burial was excavated in Mikulčice, another in Sterlitamak) of the ninth and tenth centuries, especially for rich members of society, where people were buried next to the skin and the skull of a saddled horse; the rest of the horse meat was possibly eaten during a burial ceremony. Roman culture left horse burials throughout their empire, including first-century burials in modern-day Waremme, Belgium and Beuningen, Netherlands.\n\nGermanic peoples attached great significance to the horse; a horse may have been an acquaintance of the god Wodan, and they may have been (according to Tacitus) confidants of the gods. Scandinavian literature from the 8th to 11th centuries emphasizes the importance of horses in Viking society. Horses were closely associated with gods, especially Odin and Freyr. Horses played a central role in funerary practices as well as in other rituals. Horses were prominent symbols of fertility, and there were many horse fertility cults. The rituals associated with these include horse fights, burials, consumption of horse meat, and horse sacrifice. \n\nHengist and Horsa, the mythical ancestors of the Anglo-Saxons, were associated with horses, and references to horses are found throughout Anglo-Saxon literature. Actual horse burials in England are relatively rare and \"may point to influence from the continent\". A well-known Anglo-Saxon horse burial (from the sixth/seventh century) is Mound 17 at Sutton Hoo, a few yards from the more famous ship burial in Mound 1. A sixth-century grave near Lakenheath, Suffolk, yielded the body of a man next to that of a \"complete horse in harness, with a bucket of food by its head.\" An other prominent example is the Wulfsen horse burial dated to 700–800 AD, near Hamburg Germany.\n\nHorse burials are relatively widespread in Iceland; as of 1999, 115 graves were found that contained the remains of horses. There were so many graves in which the remains of a human female was associated with those of a horse, that it was speculated that a horse burial in association with a male warrior did not occur in Iceland.\n\nExamination of the archaeological record in Norway has revealed some patterns that are comparable to horse burials in other areas. Of the six-hundred graves excavated forty of them are horse burials. Horse burials are found in both Norway and Iceland to occur more frequently with males, but are not exclusive to males. There are some female burials with horses, but a significantly lower number of them are found. Most graves are covered by circular or oval mounds. The grave goods found in Viking burials associated with horses in Norway and Iceland are also pretty similar. For male burials there are usually found weapons and tools, and women are usually found with tools, beads, brooches. Both genders are often found buried with riding equipment like horse bits and headstalls. \nViking burial rituals were complex and dramatic. One witness Ibn Fadlan Risala describes the ship burial ritual in detail. The burial consisted of days of mourning, sewing special burial clothes, dog sacrifice, running horses then cutting them into pieces and putting them in the ship with the deceased, and burning the whole thing. This shows that horse slaughter was dramatic and memorable; it was noted in this story. Also taking into consideration the economic value of horses, it was probably not a decision taken lightly. Given the public display of the sacrifice, it could not have solely been for personal religious reasons and could have had important social implications as well.\n\nHorse burials are well-known from Ancient China as well, beginning with the Shang Dynasty. Particularly notable is the tomb of Duke Jing of Qi (reigned 547–490 BCE), which contained a separate pit with the remains of possibly over 600 horses. Later burials, especially from the Tang dynasty, featured the well-known pottery horses.\n\n"}

Janzen is a Professor Emeritus in the Department of Anthropology at the University of Kansas. He has been a leading figure on issues of health, illness, and healing in Southern and Central Africa since the 1960s and has dedicated much of his career to providing a better understanding of African society. Janzen’s knowledge of the Kikongo language and his intermittent visits to the lower Congo region between 1964 and 1982 have paved the way for a contextual understanding of the roots of Western Equatorial African approaches to sickness and healing, combining African and Western derived biomedical therapies. Janzen’s research has expanded to include other African countries such as Rwanda, Burundi, Senegal, South Africa, Swaziland, Tanzania, and Sudan. He is the former director of the Kansas African Studies Center at the University of Kansas, and is currently a professor of medical and socio-cultural anthropology at the University of Kansas.\n\nJohn M. Janzen was born to Hilda Gertrude Neufeldt and Louis Abraham Janzen on October 28, 1937, in the town of Newton in Central Kansas. He is the second of four children, and one of three boys in his family. He is married to Reinhild Kauenhoven and has three children.\n\nUpon graduation from Berean Academy in Butler County, Kansas, he attended Bethel College in Harvey County, Kansas for four years. Here he met his future wife, Reinhild Kauenhoven, a then student-colleague from Göttingen, Germany. After his second year in school, Janzen joined the PAX program of the Mennonite Central Committee that took him to Africa for two years of service in lieu of joining the U.S. military. During this time, Janzen worked on projects involving education, and helped in the construction of a hospital in the late colonial setting of the South Savannah of Belgian Congo. It was during this time that Janzen became interested in learning more about Africa. Returning home, Janzen pursued a graduate degree in anthropology. He graduated from Bethel College in 1961 with a bachelor's degree in Social Science and Philosophy, and was accepted to the University of Chicago as a graduate student in anthropology.\n\nJanzen spent his first year in an intensive study of Arabic and Islamic social and political thought with Mushin Madhi, a political philosopher who specialized in medieval Islamic political thought, at the Oriental Institute in Chicago. Madhi's work further motivated Janzen to pursue a career in ethnography and anthropology. The following year, Janzen received a grant from the French government to attend the University of Paris (Sorbonne), from which he received a certificate of African Studies in 1963. His stay in a predominantly Structuralist and Marxist France influenced Janzen’s ideology and led him to the belief that material existence shapes societies and ideas. Janzen rejected the notion of a solely symbolic anthropology. Janzen received an M.A. in Anthropology from the University of Chicago in May 1964, and began his PhD at the University of Chicago soon after. John married Kauenhoven, the same year.\n\nBetween 1964 and 1966, John traveled to the lower Congo region, where he examined the social and political organization, economic development, religion, health, and patterns of health care seeking among the Kongo peoples. Here, Janzen’s research took on a historical perspective, as he used the pre-colonial, colonial, and post-colonial mercantile trade of the 16th to late 19th centuries to illustrate how the trade contributed to shaping Kongo perceptions of health, suffering, and healing from the 17th to the early 20th centuries. Janzen returned home in 1966 to complete his dissertation, titled \"Elemental Categories, Symbols, and Ideas of Association in Kongo-Manianga Society.\" He received his PhD from the University of Chicago in June 1967.\n\nJanzen returned to Newton, Kansas and began teaching as an assistant professor at Bethel College from 1967-1968. In 1969 he received the Social Science Research Council Post-Doctoral Fellowship and returned to the lower Congo/Zaire region to complete a study on Kongo therapeutics. He began teaching as an assistant professor at McGill University in Montreal in 1969. It was here that Janzen was first exposed to semiotics. He looked for ways to connect materiality with ideas and symbols in a continuum, and looked into the work of Victor Turner, who resolved the relation between materiality, consciousness, and ideas, without fixating on any one particular aspect. Janzen also began reading Roland Barthes' books on semiotics and grew highly interested in the field.\n\nIn 1970, Janzen took a break from teaching and traveled to Europe, where he spent a month in Sweden working on Lower Congo archival materials. He returned to his teaching position at McGill and remained there until 1972, when he received an offer as associate professor in socio-cultural anthropology and African studies from the University of Kansas. In 1974, Janzen published his first book, \"Anthology of Kongo Religion: Primary Texts from Lower Zaire\" (KU Publications 1974).\n\nDuring his time at the University of Kansas, Janzen published \"The Quest for Therapy in Lower Zaire\" (California, 1978), reissued in paperback as \"The Quest for Therapy: Medical Pluralism in Lower Zaire\" (1982) and in French translation as \"La quête de la thérapie au Bas-Zaïre\" (Karthala, 1995). This was based on Janzen’s Social Science Research Council Post-Doctoral Fellowship, as well as a two-year seminar taught at McGill. The book, which examined the foundations of Equatorial African approaches to sickness and healing from African and Western-derived biomedical therapies, received the Wellcome Medal and Award from the Royal Anthropological Institute of Great Britain and Ireland for anthropological research pertaining to medical issues. Eventually the previous series editor, Professor Charles Leslie of the University of California Press, asked him to become editor of the \"Comparative Studies of Health Systems and Medical Care\" journal, a position he accepted.\n\nWhile still teaching at the University of Kansas, Janzen received the Alexander von Humboldt Fellowship for his study on the Western Equatorial African historic Lemba cult traces in Western European museums. Janzen’s research of the Lemba, which he described as a cult for elite men and women emphasizing alliance building through marriage, trade, and healing, led to the publication of his book \"Lemba (1650–1930): A Drum of Affliction in Africa and the new World\" (1982). In this book, Janzen identifies the sickness of the Lemba as resulting from subordinate's envy of the mercantile elite’s wealth. The drum of affliction, a translation of the proto and pan-Bantu word \"ngoma\", typically includes a mode of affliction, a network of those commonly afflicted, visitation on them by an ancestor or spirit who has experienced the same affliction, and ritual event that brings together healers, the commonly afflicted, and their families in rhythmic, song-dance, therapeutic activity. The drum of affliction paradigm had been explored earlier by Victor Turner's work in the Southern Savannah.\n\nJanzen's work on the Ngoma paradigm led to further exploration of the phenomenon by expanding his research into Central and Southern Africa. He traveled to much of the Eastern and Western Bantu areas of Africa. His position as a lecturer at the University of Cape Town facilitated his access to information and contacts. He published \"Ngoma: Discourses of Healing in Central and Southern Africa\" in 1992. Another aspect of Janzen’s work during this time was the tracing of Kongo culture to the New World.\n\nAlso dedicated to his research on the Mennonites, Janzen remained actively involved in Mennonite affairs. In 1991, Janzen and his wife, Reinhild, co-authored a book, which was the catalogue of a special exhibit at the museum, titled \"Mennonite Furniture: A Migrant Tradition 1766-1910\". Janzen became heavily involved in Mennonite history during a 1989 sabbatical, when he and his wife traced the regions from the Netherlands to the Baltic Seacoast.\n\nJanzen’s work on African healing continued to expand when in 1994–1995, he was asked to travel to the post-genocide Great Lakes Region of Rwanda, Burundi, and eastern Zaire/Congo. This led to another book; \"Do I Still have a Life? Voices from the Aftermath of War in Rwanda and Burundi\" (2001), a comparison of the actions of ordinary people and leaders in several communes in Rwanda and Burundi leading up to, and following, the war and genocide.\n\nHis work at the University of Kansas soon developed into a concentration on African Medical Anthropology, involving work with war, trauma, healing, semiotics, socio-cultural anthropology, and medical anthropology. During this time, Janzen published \"The Social Fabric of Health: An Introduction to Medical Anthropology\" (2002).\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "38695606", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=38695606", "title": "Kvikk case", "text": "Kvikk case\n\nThe Kvikk case is about a variety of birth defects in the children of the men who served on HNoMS \"Kvikk\". AN investigation found that the ship's electronic systems were not to blame; no other cause has been established. \n\nSuspicion arose when two former officers accidentally met in the orthopedic department at Haukeland University Hospital in Bergen, and it was later revealed that in all eleven children already had been born with birth defects from 1987 to 1994. In the end, the case counted 17 injured children, and it was also discovered that the phenomenon of birth defects already had started in 1983. \n\nAmong the claimed birth defects are clubfoot, thumb hypoplasia, hip dysplasia, congenital heart defects, structural brain damage, cataracts, and other defects. Some of the children have also had developmental delays and behavioral problems.\n\nKvikk was the only vessel in the Norwegian navy that was used as an electronic warfare (EW) vessel, and one widely discussed theory was that the powerful electromagnetic radiation from the boat's radio communication masts and radar led to several of those who served aboard the ship having children with clubfoot, and in some cases stillborn children. The idea was that the powerful radiation possibly damaged genetic material in the sperm of the men who worked aboard. A total of 17 out of 85 children of officers who served at Kvikk have been born with birth defects.\n\nOf the other theories about the cause of the deformities is one that \"Kvikk\" was the only vessel that was used to experiment with different types of camouflage paint.\n\nIn 1987 Kvikk was equipped for electronic warfare, partly by getting an extra radar sender stern rated to 750 watts, which then was used very actively to create radar jamming during exercises and tests. Kvikk went out of service as an EW-vessel in December 1994.\n\nThe Norwegian Armed Forces knew before the case came up that very powerful radiation had been measured on Kvikk. There had also been measured heavy radiation at other defense vessels as well as land installations that all exceeded NATO's limits for radiation hazard, such as the HNoMS Narvik and HNoMS Tjeld. Kvikk, however, is a much smaller vessel than those, and the radiation distance to the crew was thus smaller. It was also not uncommon for the crew on Kvikk to reside around the mast during noise transmissions, and they were thus directly exposed to strong electromagnetic radiation from the mast that it has been speculated in whether may have affected their genetic material.\n\nAs an additional risk factor the radar on Kvikk had a stabilizer that were made to ensure that the radar beam was kept level with the horizon so that it also would work in choppy seas, but this mechanism had a weakness that made the radar tip over many times and thus sending radiation directly down on the deck. Therefore the crew in many cases have been directly exposed to radiation at a very close hold when they were on the deck.\n\nIn addition, four fathers who worked as electronic service technicians at the workshop of Haakonsvern got children with chromosome abnormalities. They worked, among other things, to correct errors and deficiencies in telecommunications equipment on Kvikk and other marine vessels, and were therefore under testing exposed to high levels of electromagnetic radiation, mostly from radars and communications equipment.\n\nIt is shown in research from the 60's and 70's that non-ionizing radiation in the microwave range can provide genotoxic mechanisms in germ cells in animals which are then relayed to the offspring, as well as practical examples have shown that radiation have led to infertility in humans, but little recent research supports this. \n\nThe Norwegian Navy, the Norwegian Radiation Protection Authority (NRPA) and a research group at Norwegian University of Science and Technology have concluded that there is no demonstrable link between the non-ionizing radiation on board and that the children were born with birth defects. The parents in the case have stated that they don't trust the research.\n\nThe case became known as the Haakonsvern Navy Base in 1996 issued a press release stating that an unusually high number of children of the employees at the naval base were damaged at birth. Verdens Gang (VG) was the first newspaper that took hold of the case, and the newspaper also found the relationship between the children who were born with birth defects and that their fathers had worked at Kvikk. VG immediately published a headline that read \"Crown Prince Haakon Magnus of Norway is one of the many who is currently aboard the MTB vessels and may be exposed to radiation.\"\n\nThe navy quickly made a decision to investigate whether there was a correlation between the electromagnetic radiation aboard Kvikk and the genes of those who had served there, but then Kvikk was already broken up - only nine days after the original press release from Haakonsvern.\n\nAfter three officers in February 1996 had notified the navy inspectorate that they had got children with birth defects after serving on Kvikk, the navy the same year gave an internal message that they did not want to hear anymore about such abnormalities from the naval staff.\n\nThe navy began to investigate whether the damages in this and similar cases could be due to radar and radio radiation. In 1998 they concluded that this was not the case and that there was no relationship between serving on the ship and having children with birth defects, so that there was no basis for liability. In the report, the Navy went far in rejecting any possible link whatsoever between birth defects to their children and that the fathers had served on Kvikk, and suggested statistical clustering as an explanation.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "4783588", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=4783588", "title": "Marcellus Empiricus", "text": "Marcellus Empiricus\n\nMarcellus Empiricus, also known as Marcellus Burdigalensis (“Marcellus of Bordeaux”), was a Latin medical writer from Gaul at the turn of the 4th and 5th centuries. His only extant work is the \"De medicamentis\", a compendium of pharmacological preparations drawing on the work of multiple medical and scientific writers as well as on folk remedies and magic. It is a significant if quirky text in the history of European medical writing, an infrequent subject of monographs, but regularly mined as a source for magic charms, Celtic herbology and lore, and the linguistic study of Gaulish and Vulgar Latin. \"Bonus auctor est\" (“he’s a good authority”) was the judgment of J.J. Scaliger, while the science historian George Sarton called the \"De medicamentis\" an “extraordinary mixture of traditional knowledge, popular (Celtic) medicine, and rank superstition.” Marcellus is usually identified with the \"magister officiorum\" of that name who held office during the reign of Theodosius I.\n\nLittle is known of the life of Marcellus. The primary sources are:\n\nThe Gallic origin of Marcellus is rarely disputed, and he is traditionally identified with the toponym Burdigalensis; that is, from Bordeaux (Latin Burdigala), within the Roman province of Aquitania. In his prefatory epistle, he refers to three Bordelaise praetorian prefects as his countrymen: Siburius, Eutropius, and Julius Ausonius, the father of the poet Decimus Magnus Ausonius. He is sometimes thought to have come from Narbonne rather than Bordeaux. There has been an attempt to make a Spanish senator of him on the basis of Symmachus's reference to property he owned in Spain; but this inference ignores that Marcellus is said explicitly to have left Spain to return to living \"in avitis penatibus\", or among the household spirits of his grandfathers — that is, at home as distinguished from Spain. He probably wrote the \"De medicamentis liber\" during his retirement there.\nThe author of the \"De medicamentis\" is most likely the Marcellus who was appointed \"magister officiorum\" by Theodosius I. The heading of the prefatory epistle identifies him as a \"vir inlustris\", translatable as “a distinguished man,” but a more formal designation of rank that indicates he had held imperial office. Marcellus's 16th-century editor Janus Cornarius gives the unhelpful phrase \"ex magno officio\" (something like “from high office”); coupled with two references in the Theodosian Code to a Marcellus as \"magister officiorum\", Cornarius's phrase has been taken as a mistaken expansion of the standard abbreviation \"mag. off.\" The \"magister officiorum\" was a sort of Minister of the Interior and the identification is consistent with what is known of the author's life and with the politics of the time. His stated connection to the Ausonii makes it likely that he was among the several aristocratic Gauls who benefitted politically when the emperor Gratian appointed his Bordelaise tutor Ausonius to high office and from Theodosius's extended residence in the western empire during the latter years of his reign.\n\nMarcellus would have entered his office sometime after April 394 A.D., when his predecessor is last attested, and before the emperor's death on January 17, 395. He was replaced in late November or December of 395, as determined by the last reference to a Marcellus holding office that is dated November 24 and by the dating of a successor. The timing of his departure suggests that he had been a supporter of Rufinus, the calculating politician of Gallic origin who was assassinated November 27 of that year, having failed to resist if not facilitating the advance of Alaric and the Visigoths. Marcellus's support may have been pragmatic or superficial; a source that condemns Rufinus heartily praises Marcellus as “the very soul of excellence.”\n\nGiven Rufinus's dealings with the Visigoths, however, it is conceivable that Marcellus should be identified with “a certain former high-ranking official from Narbonne” mentioned by Orosius as present in Bethlehem in 415 A.D. While visiting Jerome, Orosius says he heard this Gaul relate the declaration made by Athaulf, king of the Visigoths, at Narbonne regarding his intentions toward the Roman empire. John Matthews argued that Marcellus, who would have been about 60 at the time, is “clearly the most eligible candidate.” Since Orosius identifies the Gaul only as having served under Theodosius, and as a “devout, cautious, and serious” person, other figures have been put forth as the likely bearer of the Athaulf declaration.\n\nIt is not unreasonable but also not necessary to conclude that Marcellus was a practicing physician. In his dissertation, the intellectual historian of magic and medicine Lynn Thorndike pronounced him the “court physician” of Theodosius I, but the evidence is thin: Libanius, if referring to this Marcellus, praises his ability to cure a headache. The prevailing view is that Marcellus should be categorized as a medical writer and not a physician. A translator of the medical writings of Isidore of Seville characterizes Marcellus as a “medical amateur” and dismisses the \"De medicamentis\" as “nothing more than the usual ancient home remedies,” and the historian of botany Ernst Meyer seems to have considered him a dilettante.\n\nLike Ausonius and later Sidonius Apollinaris, Marcellus is among those aristocratic Gauls of the 4th and 5th centuries who were nominally or even devoutly Christian but who fashioned themselves after the Republican ideal of the Roman noble: a career in politics balanced with country villas and informational or literary writing on a range of subjects, including philosophy, astronomy, agriculture, and the natural sciences. Although medical writing might have been regarded as a lesser achievement, it was a resource for the \"pater familias\" who traditionally took personal responsibility for the health care of his household, both family members and slaves.\n\nPrescriptions for veterinary treatments dispersed throughout the \"De medicamentis\" also suggest the interests and concerns of the author — the letter from Symmachus serves mainly to inquire whether Marcellus can provide thoroughbred horses for games to be sponsored by his son, who has been elected praetor — and of his intended audience, either the owners of estates or the literate workers who managed them. “Do-it-yourself” manuals were popular among the landowning elite because they offered, as Marcellus promises, a form of self-sufficiency and mastery.\n\nAlf Önnerfors has argued that a personal element distinguishes the \"De medicamentis\" from similar medical manuals, which are in effect if not fact anonymous. In the letter to his sons, whom he addresses as \"dulcissimi\" (“my sweetest”), Marcellus expresses the hope that they and their families will, in case of sickness, find support and remedies in their father's manual, without intervention by doctors (\"sine medicis intercessione\"). This emphasis on self-reliance, however, is not meant to exclude others, but to empower oneself to help others; appealing to \"divina misericordia\" (“godlike compassion”), Marcellus urges his sons to extend \"caritas\" (“caring” or perhaps Christian “charity”) to strangers and the poor as well as to their loved ones. The tone, Önnerfors concludes, is “humane and full of gentle humor.”\n\nMarcellus is usually regarded as a Christian, but he also embraces magico-medical practices that draw on the traditional religions of antiquity. Historian of botanical pharmacology Jerry Stannard believed that evidence in the \"De medicamentis\" could neither prove nor disprove Marcellus's religious identity, noting that the few references to Christianity are “commonplace” and that, conversely, charms with references to Hellenistic magic occur widely in medieval Christian texts. In his classic study \"The Cult of the Saints\", Peter Brown describes and sets out to explain what he sees as “the exclusively pagan tone of a book whose author was possibly a Christian writing for a largely Christianized upper class.” Historians of ancient medicine Carmélia Opsomer and Robert Halleux note that in his preface, Marcellus infuses Christian concerns into the ancient tradition of “doctoring without doctors.” That Marcellus was at least a nominal Christian is suggested by his appointment to high office by Theodosius I, who exerted his will to Christianize the empire by ordering the Roman senate to convert en masse.\nThe internal evidence of religion in the text is meager. The phrase \"divina misericordia\" in the preface appears also in St. Augustine’s \"De civitate Dei\", where the reference to divine mercy follows immediately after a passage on barbarian incursions. Marcellus and Augustine are contemporaries, and the use of the phrase is less a question of influence than of the currency of a shared Christian concept. Elsewhere, passages sometimes cited as evidence of Christianity on closer inspection only display the syncretism of the Hellenistic magico-religious tradition, as Stannard noted. Christ, for instance, is invoked in an herb-gathering incantation, but the ritual makes use of magico-medical practices of pre-Christian antiquity. A Judaeo-Christian reference — \"nomine domini Iacob, in nomine domini Sabaoth\" — appears as part of a magic charm that the practitioner is instructed to inscribe on a \"lamella\", or metal leaf. Such “magic words” often include nonsense syllables and more-or-less corrupt phrases from “exotic” languages such as Celtic, Aramaic, Coptic, and Hebrew, and are not indications of formal adherence to a religion.\n\nThe first reference to any religious figure in the text is Asclepius, the premier god of healing among the Greeks. Marcellus alludes to a Roman version of the myth in which Asclepius restores the dismembered Virbius to wholeness; as a writer, Marcellus says, he follows a similar course of gathering the \"disiecta … membra\" (\"scattered body parts\") of his sources into one \"corpus\" (whole body). In addition to gods from the Greco-Roman pantheon, one charm deciphered as a Gaulish passage has been translated to invoke the Celtic god Aisus, or Esus as it is more commonly spelled, for his aid in dispelling throat trouble.\n\nAn inscription dated 445 recognizes a Marcellus as the most important financial supporter in the rebuilding of the cathedral at Narbonne, carried out during the bishopric of St. Rusticus. John Matthews has argued that this Marcellus is likely to have been a son or near descendant of the medical writer, since the family of an \"inlustris\" is most likely to have possessed the wealth for such a generous contribution. The donor had served for two years as praetorian prefect of Gaul. Assuming that the man would have been a native, Matthews weighs this piece of evidence with the Athaulf anecdote from Orosius to situate the author of the \"De medicamentis\" in the Narbonensis, but this is a minority view.\n\nMarcellus begins the \"De medicamentis liber\" by acknowledging his models. The texts he draws on include the so-called \"Medicina Plinii\" or “Medical Pliny,” the herbal (\"Herbarius\") of Pseudo-Apuleius, and the pharmacological treatise of Scribonius Largus, as well as the most famous Latin encyclopedia from antiquity, the \"Historia naturalis\" of Pliny the Elder.\n\nThe work is structured as follows:\n\n\nMarcellus was a transitional figure between ancient and medieval \"materia medica\". Although the contents of the recipes — their names, uses, and methods of treatment — derive from the medical texts of ancient Greece and Rome, the book also points forward to doctrines and approaches characteristic of medieval medicine. Marcellus is seldom cited directly, but his influence, though perhaps not wide or pervasive, can be traced in several medieval medical texts.\n\nA major change in the approach to writing about botanical pharmacology is signalled in the \"De Medicamentis\". As texts associated with Mediterranean medicine traveled west and north with the expanding borders of the Roman empire, the plants required by drug recipes were no longer familiar, and the descriptions or illustrations provided by earlier herbals failed to correspond to indigenous flora. Marcellus's practice of offering synonyms is one attempt to bridge this gap. He often provides a string of correspondences: the Greek plant name \"polygonos\" is first glossed as \"sanguinaria\" in Latin (1.2), then as \"what we [in Gaul?] call rubia\" (1.44); in the same chapter \"polygonos\" is given as another name for \"millefolium\" (1.28), and identified elsewhere as equivalent to \"verbena\" (10.5). Of the dozen or so Celtic plant names, ten are provided with or as synonyms for Greek or Latin names. A preoccupation with naming rather than description is a characteristic also of medieval herbals. The problems of identifying plants may have been an intellectual attraction for Marcellus's Renaissance editor Cornarius, whose botanical work emphasized the value of words over illustration.\n\nAnother medieval emphasis foreshadowed in Marcellus is a concern for locating ingredients in their native environment, replacing the exotic flora and fauna prescribed in texts from antiquity with indigenous species. Recipes in both Marcellus and the medieval writers tend toward “polypharmacy,” or the use of a great number of ingredients in a single preparation. Many recipes in \"De medicamentis\" contain at least ten ingredients, and one, the \"antidotus Cosmiana\" (29.11), is compounded of 73.\n\nMarcellus is one of the likely sources for Anglo-Saxon leechcraft, or at least drew on the shared European magico-medical tradition that also produced runic healing: a 13th-century wooden amulet from Bergen is inscribed with a charm in runes that resembles Marcellus's Aisus charm.\n\nIn \"The Cult of the Saints\", Peter Brown contrasts the “horizontal” or environmental healing prescribed by Marcellus to the “vertical,” authoritarian healing of his countryman and contemporary St. Martin of Tours, known for miracle cures and especially exorcism. Since magic for medical purposes can be considered a form of faith healing, that is also not a distinction between the two; “rich layers of folklore and superstition,” writes Brown, “lie beneath the thin veneer of Hippocratic empiricism” in Marcellus. Nor does the difference lie in the social class of the intended beneficiaries, for both therapeutic systems encompassed “country folk and the common people” as well as senatorial landowners. At the Christian shrines, however, healing required submission to “socially chartered” authority; in Marcellus, the patient or practitioner, often addressed directly as “you,” becomes the agent of his own cure.\n\nWhile the power of a saint to offer a cure resided within a particular shrine which the patient must visit, health for Marcellus lay in the interconnectivity of the patient with his environment, the use he actively made of herbs, animals, minerals, dung, language, and transformative processes such as emulsification, calcination and fermentation. In the prefatory epistle, Marcellus insists on the efficacy of \"remedia fortuita atque simplicia\" (remedies that are readily available and act directly), despite the many recipes involving more than a dozen ingredients; in the concluding \"Carmen\", he celebrates ingredients from the far reaches of the empire and the known world (lines 41–67), emphasizing that the Roman practitioner has access to a “global” marketplace.\n\n"}

Models use some basic assumptions and mathematics to find parameters for various infectious diseases and use those parameters to calculate the effects of different interventions, like mass vaccination programmes. The modelling can help in deciding which intervention/s to avoid and which to trial.\n\nThe modeling of infectious diseases is a tool which has been used to study the mechanisms by which diseases spread, to predict the future course of an outbreak and to evaluate strategies to control an epidemic.\n\nThe first scientist who systematically tried to quantify causes of death was John Graunt in his book \"Natural and Political Observations made upon the Bills of Mortality\", in 1662. The bills he studied were listings of numbers and causes of deaths published weekly. Graunt’s analysis of causes of death is considered the beginning of the “theory of competing risks” which according to Daley and Gani is “a theory that is now well established among modern epidemiologists”.\n\nThe earliest account of mathematical modelling of spread of disease was carried out in 1766 by Daniel Bernoulli. Trained as a physician, Bernoulli created a mathematical model to defend the practice of inoculating against smallpox. The calculations from this model showed that universal inoculation against smallpox would increase the life expectancy from 26 years 7 months to 29 years 9 months. Daniel Bernoulli's work preceded the modern understanding of germ theory.\n\nIn the early 20th century, William Hamer and Ronald Ross applied the law of mass action to explain epidemic behaviour.\n\nThe 1920s saw the emergence of compartmental models. The Kermack–McKendrick epidemic model (1927) and the Reed–Frost epidemic model (1928) both describe the relationship between susceptible, infected and immune individuals in a population. The Kermack–McKendrick epidemic model model was successful in predicting the behavior of outbreaks very similar to that observed in many recorded epidemics.\n\nModels are only as good as the assumptions on which they are based. If a model makes predictions which are out of line with observed results and the mathematics is correct, the initial assumptions must change to make the model useful.\n\n\"Stochastic\" means being or having a random variable. A stochastic model is a tool for estimating probability distributions of potential outcomes by allowing for random variation in one or more inputs over time. Stochastic models depend on the chance variations in risk of exposure, disease and other illness dynamics.\n\nWhen dealing with large populations, as in the case of tuberculosis, deterministic or compartmental mathematical models are often used. In a deterministic model, individuals in the population are assigned to different subgroups or compartments, each representing a specific stage of the epidemic. Letters such as M, S, E, I, and R are often used to represent different stages. \nThe transition rates from one class to another are mathematically expressed as derivatives, hence the model is formulated using differential equations. While building such models, it must be assumed that the population size in a compartment is differentiable with respect to time and that the epidemic process is deterministic. In other words, the changes in population of a compartment can be calculated using only the history that was used to develop the model.\n\nThe \"basic reproduction number (\"denoted by \"R)\" is a measure of how transferrable a disease is. It is the average number of people that a single infectious person will infect over the course of their infection. This quantity determines whether the infection will spread exponentially, die out, or remain constant: if \"R\" > 1, then each person on average infects more than one other person so the disease will spread; if \"R\" < 1, then each person infects less than one person on average so the disease will die out; and if \"R\" = 1, then each person will infect exactly one other person, so the disease will become \"endemic:\" it will move throughout the population but not increase or decrease.\n\nThe basic reproduction number can be computed as a ratio of known rates over time: if an infectious individual contacts β other people per unit time, if all of those people are assumed to contract the disease, and if the disease has a mean infectious period of 1/γ, then the basic reproduction number is just \"R\" = \"β\"/\"γ\". Some diseases have multiple possible latency periods, in which case the reproduction number for the disease overall is the sum of the reproduction number for each transition time into the disease. For example, Blower et al. model two forms of tuberculosis infection: in the fast case, the symptoms show up immediately after exposure; in the slow case, the symptoms develop years after the initial exposure (endogenous reactivation). The overall reproduction number is the sum of the two forms of contraction: \"R\" = \"R\" + \"R\".\n\nAn infectious disease is said to be endemic when it can be sustained in a population without the need for external inputs. This means that, on average, each infected person is infecting \"exactly\" one other person (any more and the number of people infected will grow exponentially and there will be an epidemic, any less and the disease will die out). In mathematical terms, that is:\n\nThe basic reproduction number (\"R\") of the disease, assuming everyone is susceptible, multiplied by the proportion of the population that is actually susceptible (\"S\") must be one (since those who are not susceptible do not feature in our calculations as they cannot contract the disease). Notice that this relation means that for a disease to be in the endemic steady state, the higher the basic reproduction number, the lower the proportion of the population susceptible must be, and vice versa.\n\nAssume the rectangular stationary age distribution and let also the ages of infection have the same distribution for each birth year. Let the average age of infection be \"A\", for instance when individuals younger than \"A\" are susceptible and those older than \"A\" are immune (or infectious). Then it can be shown by an easy argument that the proportion of the population that is susceptible is given by:\n\nBut the mathematical definition of the endemic steady state can be rearranged to give:\n\nTherefore, due to the transitive property:\n\nThis provides a simple way to estimate the parameter \"R\" using easily available data.\n\nFor a population with an exponential age distribution,\n\nThis allows for the basic reproduction number of a disease given \"A\" and \"L\" in either type of population distribution.\n\nThe SIR model is one of the more basic models used for modelling epidemics. There are a large number of modifications to the model.\n\nIn 1927, W. O. Kermack and A. G. McKendrick created a model in which they considered a fixed population with only three compartments: susceptible, formula_6; infected, formula_7; and removed, formula_8. The compartments used for this model consist of three classes:\nThe flow of this model may be considered as follows:\nUsing a fixed population, formula_13, Kermack and McKendrick derived the following equations:\n\nSeveral assumptions were made in the formulation of these equations: First, an individual in the population must be considered as having an equal probability as every other individual of contracting the disease with a rate of formula_17, which is considered the contact or infection rate of the disease. Therefore, an infected individual makes contact and is able to transmit the disease with formula_18 others per unit time and the fraction of contacts by an infected with a susceptible is formula_19. The number of new infections in unit time per infective then is formula_20, giving the rate of new infections (or those leaving the susceptible category) as formula_21. For the second and third equations, consider the population leaving the susceptible class as equal to the number entering the infected class. However, a number equal to the fraction (formula_22 which represents the mean recovery/death rate, or formula_23 the mean infective period) of infectives are leaving this class per unit time to enter the removed class. These processes which occur simultaneously are referred to as the Law of Mass Action, a widely accepted idea that the rate of contact between two groups in a population is proportional to the size of each of the groups concerned. Finally, it is assumed that the rate of infection and recovery is much faster than the time scale of births and deaths and therefore, these factors are ignored in this model.\n\nThe expected duration of susceptibility will beformula_24where formula_25reflects the time alive (life expectancy) and formula_26reflects the time in the susceptible state before becoming infected, which can be simplified to:\n\nformula_27,\n\nsuch that the number of susceptible persons is the number entering the susceptible compartment formula_28times the duration of susceptibility:\n\nformula_29.\n\nAnalogously, the steady-state number of infected persons is the number entering the infected state from the susceptible state (number susceptible, times rate of infection formula_30, times the duration of infectiousness formula_31:\n\nformula_32.\n\nThere are a large number of modifications of the SIR model, including those that include births and deaths, where upon recovery there is no immunity (SIS model), where immunity lasts only for a short period of time (SIRS), where there is a latent period of the disease where the person is not infectious (SEIS and SEIR), and where infants can be born with immunity (MSIR).\n\nMathematical models need to integrate the increasing volume of data being generated on host-pathogen interactions. Many theoretical studies of the population dynamics, structure and evolution of infectious diseases of plants and animals, including humans, are concerned with this problem.\n\nResearch topics include:\n\n\nIf the proportion of the population that is immune exceeds the herd immunity level for the disease, then the disease can no longer persist in the population. Thus, if this level can be exceeded by vaccination, the disease can be eliminated. An example of this being successfully achieved worldwide is the global smallpox eradication, with the last wild case in 1977. The WHO is carrying out a similar vaccination campaign to eradicate polio.\n\nThe herd immunity level will be denoted \"q\". Recall that, for a stable state:\n\n\"S\" will be (1 − \"q\"), since \"q\" is the proportion of the population that is immune and \"q\" + \"S\" must equal one (since in this simplified model, everyone is either susceptible or immune). Then:\n\nRemember that this is the threshold level. If the proportion of immune individuals \"exceeds\" this level due to a mass vaccination programme, the disease will die out.\n\nWe have just calculated the critical immunisation threshold (denoted \"q\"). It is the minimum proportion of the population that must be immunised at birth (or close to birth) in order for the infection to die out in the population.\n\nIf the vaccine used is insufficiently effective or the required coverage cannot be reached (for example due to popular resistance), the programme may fail to exceed \"q\". Such a programme can, however, disturb the balance of the infection without eliminating it, often causing unforeseen problems.\n\nSuppose that a proportion of the population \"q\" (where \"q\" < \"q\") is immunised at birth against an infection with \"R\">1. The vaccination programme changes \"R\" to \"R\" where\n\nThis change occurs simply because there are now fewer susceptibles in the population who can be infected. R is simply R minus those that would normally be infected but that cannot be now since they are immune.\n\nAs a consequence of this lower basic reproduction number, the average age of infection \"A\" will also change to some new value \"A\" in those who have been left unvaccinated.\n\nRecall the relation that linked R, \"A\" and \"L\". Assuming that life expectancy has not changed, now:\n\nBut \"R\" = \"L\"/\"A\" so:\n\nThus the vaccination programme will raise the average age of infection, another mathematical justification for a result that might have been intuitively obvious. Unvaccinated individuals now experience a reduced force of infection due to the presence of the vaccinated group.\n\nHowever, it is important to consider this effect when vaccinating against diseases that are more severe in older people. A vaccination programme against such a disease that does not exceed \"q\" may cause more deaths and complications than there were before the programme was brought into force as individuals will be catching the disease later in life. These unforeseen outcomes of a vaccination programme are called perverse effects.\n\nIf a vaccination programme causes the proportion of immune individuals in a population to exceed the critical threshold for a significant length of time, transmission of the infectious disease in that population will stop. This is known as elimination of the infection and is different from eradication.\n\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "3654679", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=3654679", "title": "Matt Talbot", "text": "Matt Talbot\n\nThe Venerable Matt Talbot, OFS (2 May 1856 – 7 June 1925) was an Irish ascetic revered by many Catholics for his piety, charity and mortification of the flesh.\n\nTalbot was an unskilled labourer. Though he lived alone for most of his life, Talbot did live with his mother for a time. His life would have gone unnoticed were it not for the cords and chains discovered on his body when he died suddenly on a Dublin street in 1925.\n\nThough he has not been formally recognized as a saint, Talbot may be considered a patron of those struggling with alcoholism. He is commemorated on 19 June.\n\nTalbot was born on 2 May 1856 at 13 Aldborough Court, Dublin, Ireland, the second eldest of twelve children of Charles and Elizabeth Talbot, a poor family in the North Strand area. He was baptised in St. Mary's Pro-Cathedral on 5 May. His father and all but the oldest of his brothers were heavy drinkers. In 1868 Matt left school at the age of twelve and went to work in a wine merchant's store. He very soon began \"sampling their wares\", and was considered a hopeless alcoholic by age thirteen. He then went to the Port & Docks Board where he worked in the whiskey stores. He frequented pubs in the city with his brothers and friends, spending most or all of his wages and running up debts. When his wages were spent, he borrowed and scrounged for money. He pawned his clothes and boots to get money for alcohol. On one occasion, he stole a fiddle from a street entertainer and sold it to buy drink.\n\nOne evening in 1884 28-year old Talbot, who was penniless and out of credit, waited outside a pub in the hope that somebody would invite him in for a drink. After several friends had passed him without offering to treat him, he went home in disgust and announced to his mother that he was going to \"take the pledge\" (renounce drink). He went to Holy Cross College, Clonliffe where he took the pledge for three months. At the end of the three months, he took the pledge for six months, then for life.\n\nHaving drunk excessively for 16 years, Talbot maintained sobriety for the following forty years of his life. There is evidence that Matt’s first seven years after taking the pledge were especially difficult. He found strength in prayer, began to attend daily Mass, and read religious books and pamphlets. He repaid all his debts scrupulously. Having searched for the fiddler whose instrument he had stolen, and failed to find him, he gave the money to the church to have Mass said for him.\n\nEven when his drinking was at its worst, Talbot was a hard worker. When he joined Pembertons, the building contractors, as a hod-carrier, his work-rate was such that he was put first on the line of hodmen to set the pace. Later, in Martin's timber yard, he took on the meanest and hardest jobs. He was respectful to his bosses but not obsequious, and on occasion stood up for a fellow-worker. On 22 September 1911 Talbot joined the builder's labourers branch of the Irish Transport and General Workers Union. When the Dublin Lockout of 1913 led to sympathy strikes throughout the city, the men of Martin's, including Talbot, came out. At first Talbot refused his strike pay, saying that he had not earned it. Later he accepted it but asked that it be shared out among the other strikers. After his death a rumour was put about that he was a strike-breaker in 1913, but all the evidence contradicts this.\n\nFrom being an indifferent Catholic in his drinking days, Talbot became increasingly devout. He lived a life of prayer, fasting, and service, trying to model himself on the sixth century Irish monks. He was guided for most of his life by Dr. Michael Hickey, Professor of Philosophy in Clonliffe College. Under Dr. Hickey's guidance Talbot's reading became wider. He read laboriously Scripture, lives of saints, \"The Confessions of St. Augustine\", and writings of St. Francis de Sales and others. When he found a part difficult to understand, he asked a priest to clarify it.\n\nDr. Hickey also gave him a light chain, (much like a clock chain), to wear as a form of penance. He became a Third Order Franciscan in 1890 and was a member of several other associations and sodalities. Talbot was a generous man. Although poor himself, he gave unstintingly to neighbours and fellow workers, to charitable institutions and the church. He ate very little. After his mother's death in 1915 he lived in a small flat with very little furniture. He slept on a plank bed with a piece of timber for a pillow. He rose at 5 a.m. every day so as to attend Mass before work. At work, whenever he had spare time, he found a quiet place to pray. He spent most of every evening on his knees. On Sundays he attended several Masses. He walked quickly, with his head down, so that he appeared to be hurrying from one Mass to another.\n\nTalbot was on his way to Mass on Trinity Sunday, 7 June 1925, when he collapsed and died of heart failure on Granby Lane in Dublin. Nobody at the scene was able to identify him. His body was taken to Jervis Street Hospital, where he was undressed, revealing the extent of his austerities. A chain had been wound around his waist, with more chains around an arm and a leg, and cords around the other arm and leg. The chains found on his body at death were not some extreme penitential regime but a symbol of his devotion to Mary, Mother of God that he wished to give himself to her totally as a slave. Talbot's story quickly filtered through the community and there were many spectators when his funeral took place at Glasnevin Cemetery on 11 June 1925. In 1972 his remains were removed to a tomb in Our Lady of Lourdes Church in Sean McDermott Street, Dublin, in the area where Matt spent his life.\n\nOn 6 November 1931, Archbishop Byrne of Dublin opened a sworn inquiry into the alleged claims of holiness of the former dock worker. The Apostolic Process, the official sworn inquiry at the Vatican, began in 1947. On 3 October 1975 Pope Paul VI declared him to be Venerable Matt Talbot, which is a step on the road to his canonisation, a process which needs evidence of a physical miracle in order to be successful. There is a particular devotion to Matt Talbot among some North American Roman Catholics among those involved in a ministry to achieve or maintain sobriety.\n\nA possible miracle in Kansas, where a healthy child was delivered despite tests showing abnormalities—Down syndrome or cystic fibrosis—after his aunt organized a prayer chain asking the intercession of Matt Talbot, is currently under investigation. If shown to be \"medically inexplicable\", the case may bring Talbot a step closer to sainthood.\n\n\"“Never be too hard on the man who can’t give up drink. It’s as hard to give up the drink as it is to raise the dead to life again. But both are possible and even easy for Our Lord. We have only to depend on him.” – Matt Talbot\"\n\nAs word of Matt Talbot spread he rapidly became an icon for Ireland's temperance movement, the Pioneer Total Abstinence Association. His story soon became known to the large Irish emigrant communities. Many addiction clinics, youth hostels and statues have been named after him throughout the world from Nebraska to Warsaw to Sydney. One of Dublin's main bridges is also named after him. A statue of Talbot was erected at Sir John Rogerson's Quay in 1988. Pope John Paul II, as a young man, wrote a paper on him.\n\nGraham Linehan has stated that the character of Matty Hislop in his comedy series \"Father Ted\" was based on Talbot.\n\nTalbot's remains were removed from Glasnevin Cemetery to Our Lady of Lourdes Church on Seán McDermott Street, Dublin, in 1972. The tomb has a glass panel through which the coffin may be seen.\n\nThere is a small plaque in Granby Lane at the site of Matt Talbot's death.\n\n"}
{"id": "37374331", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=37374331", "title": "Measure B", "text": "Measure B\n\nMeasure B, also known as the \"County of Los Angeles Safer Sex In the Adult Film Industry Act,\" is the law that requires the use of condoms in all vaginal and anal sex scenes in pornography productions filmed in Los Angeles County, California. The measure also requires porn production companies to obtain a health permit prior to production and to post the permit and a notice to performers regarding condom use during production. All individuals involved will also be required to pay $1,600 every 2 years.\n\nIn 2009 similar legislation was introduced at the State level. Citing an HIV positive test for a performer in May of that year, the Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors sought to find a sponsor for a bill to mandate condom use in adult films. They had originally approved a resolution to seek legislation in October 2008, and made it part of their official state legislative agenda in December. The primary testing center at the time was the Adult Industry Medical Health Care Foundation (AIM). Prior to this, in 2004, there were several related cases of HIV positive tests reported. Of the twenty-two reported cases roughly half were among men who work in gay films, while the rest were both men and women working in heterosexual productions.\n\nMeasure B was voted on November 6, 2012 and passed with 55.9% of the vote.\n\nIn 2012 proponents gathered 372,000 voter signatures through a citizens' initiative in Los Angeles County to put Measure B on the 2012 ballot. Supporters of Measure B said it would stop the spread of STDs in the porn industry and protect tax dollars.\n\nSupporters included porn performer Aurora Snow, Jenna Jameson, Pink Cross Foundation, and Michael Weinstein, president of the AIDS Healthcare Foundation. Weinstein claims that according to the Los Angeles County Public Health Department, \"thousands of performers have been infected with thousands of STDs over the last few years.\"\n\nThe No On Government Waste Committee opposed Measure B claiming it would waste tax-payer money and drive the porn industry out of the state. It said that it was supported in its opposition by the Los Angeles County Federation of Republican Women, Los Angeles County Republican and Libertarian Parties, and the Log Cabin Republicans of Los Angeles.\n\nThe \"Los Angeles Times\" and \"Los Angeles Daily News\" both editorialized in opposition to Measure B.\n\nOpponents include porn performers Kayden Kross, Ava Addams, Ron Jeremy, Tera Patrick, Tanya Tate, Priya Anjali Rai, Jessica Drake, Steven St. Croix, Danny Wylde, and James Deen.\n\nTate was quoted in a San Fernando Valley Business Journal article to the effect that she would want whomever she decided to have sex with \"to get tested until I felt comfortable to sleep with them without a condom,\" adding that AIDS Healthcare Foundation president Michael Weinstein (who the article was about), \"should be spending money on treating [AIDS] and educating regular people about how to protect themselves instead of going after a small community that is aware of the risks.\"\n\nPornographic actress Nina Hartley, who has a degree in nursing, said: \"Shooting scenes with condoms are noticeably more uncomfortable.\" She said they cause friction burns vaginally and anally, that they slip off and rip, and that they get stuck inside. \"They aren't built to withstand our shoots,\" she said. Stoya, another female performer in adult films, said, \"If you condense the amount of time we were actually having sex, it probably added up to almost four to five hours.\"\n\nIn January 2014, Falcon Entertainment countered the ban after its passing by using post-production editing to remove the condoms from footage in its film \"California Dreamin' 1\"; the edits were intentional, as the film was intended to reflect the \"carefree and spontaneous\" style of the 1970s and 80s.\n\nThe financial and technical viability of this was challenged by an expert in videography in 2009. Axel Braun, in his experience as a director and the owner of the post-production company Level 5 Post, reiterated this in 2014.\n\nIn her first column for the OC Weekly, performer Tasha Reign reiterated Hartley and Stoya's comments regarding the impracticality of imposing condoms on the industry. Reign said, \"Want to know a dirty secret that Measure B proponents, who say what they did was in the interest of us supposedly helpless performers, never brought up? After hours of sex with no breaks, attempting to endure the friction of the condom in your vagina or anus is...impossible. And to do this daily amounts to an occupational work hazard. Of course, due to the lack of respect towards the adult business and blatant disregard from society regarding the sexual comfort or even opinions of female performers, none of this mattered. No one asked us.\"\n\nIn November 2012, Vivid Entertainment CEO Steven Hirsch and pornographic actors Dahlia Sky, Penny Pax, Veruca James, Steven St. Croix and Michael Vegas appeared in a video titled \"Thank You From the Porn Industry\" for Funny or Die. The video lampoons Measure B and requiring the use of condoms in all sex scenes filmed in Los Angeles County.\n\nIndustry and agency officials say there has been a shift in where porn is made, and estimated the potential economic impact at US$6 billion. In November 2013, Diane Duke, executive director of industry trade group Free Speech Coalition, said, \"Fewer people are shooting (adult film) in L.A. County, and some have moved to other areas around California or other states...\". Two months later, \"The Verge\" reported, \"in the midst of rampant piracy on top of Measure B, many studios have relocated to Las Vegas, where filmmaking is cheaper and regulations are more lax.\" Then in September 2014, Robert Lang, director of Brookings Mountain West (a collaboration of UNLV and the Brookings Institution to study issues facing the Intermountain West region), was quoted as saying, \"Some big part of it will stay (in LA) and production companies will continue to be based there, so it's not accurate to say that all of that $6 billion translates to Southern Nevada. But what it also gives to Las Vegas is that it's building technical capacity that undergirds non-pornographic production and media. It adds some competitive advantage in scale to Los Angeles.\"\n\nIn the months after the measure passed, production companies began seeking shooting locations outside of Los Angeles County. In the Ventura County city of Camarillo, CA, the city council passed a forty-five-day moratorium on the issuance of film permits, including special-event and conditional-use permits, for porn productions due to the increased number of applications.\n\nA year after the passing of the measure, it was reported that prior to Measure B typically up to 500 permits would be applied for in Los Angeles County with FilmL.A., the nonprofit that processes permits for motion picture, television and commercial productions. In 2013, applications were received for twenty-four permits. A spokesman with the county's Department of Public Health said that eleven health permits were requested by adult-film studios.\n\nOne of the industry's largest producers, Vivid Entertainment, has gone outside Los Angeles County since the law took effect. Co-founder Steven Hirsch said, \"We will not be shooting in L.A. under the current situation, which is too bad,\" \"There's a uniqueness to L.A. you can't find anywhere such as backdrops. It's also impacted us financially because shooting outside the county can become more expensive.\" Some production moved to Las Vegas citing a more favorable environment. Clark County, where Las Vegas is located, does not require health permits and gives out location licenses for a nominal fee; filming permits in Los Angeles County can cost hundreds of dollars.\n\nIn September 2014, the \"Las Vegas Sun\" featured an article about the adult industry's possible relocation from Southern California to Las Vegas. According to commentary by \"AVN\" magazine's political analyst Mark Kernes, the author of the \"Sun\" article, Andrea Domanick, \"manages to make a few good points—and snags some quotes from Kink.com CEO Peter Acworth\". In the article Acworth is quoted as saying, \"Vegas is looking more and more attractive as time goes by... I think that a lot of companies are doing what we're doing. They're setting up satellite offices and getting their feet wet with Vegas as a potential place to shoot. The move is happening, but quietly. They don't want a target on their back.\" Acworth had announced several weeks earlier that he was shopping for office/production space in Las Vegas. The article also mentions the ease of production relative to California by stating that Nevada requires film permits only for specific locations and conditions. It states, \"Shooting on private property, frequently the choice of porn producers, requires no permit or notification, and the state has no explicit regulations about condom use.\" The article also quotes a technician with knowledge of the mainstream film industry in Southern California and Nevada. Jim Reid of JR Lighting, one of Nevada's largest production rental companies stated, \"A lot of people I know in the mainstream industry started out in the adult industry in California. It's a very good training ground.\"\n\nIn December, after the ruling of the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals regarding the measure, it was announced that applications for permits for pornographic productions has reduced by 95%.\n\nOn January 30, 2014 California Assemblyperson Isadore Hall (D – Compton, 64th District) introduced Assembly Bill 1576. Like its failed predecessor, AB640 in 2013 (also introduced by Hall), the bill is a statewide version of Measure B that affects Los Angeles County only and makes it a criminal offense to violate its provisions. The bill also imposes a controversial government mandate on testing, forcing producers to disclose performers' STI test details to the Department of Industrial Relations. As of June 2014 the bill has passed through the Labor and Employment (04/01/14), ARTS, ENTERTAINMENT, SPORTS, TOURISM, AND INTERNET MEDIA (04/28/14), APPROPRIATIONS (05/20/14), and ASSEMBLY FLOOR ANALYSIS (5/22/14) committees.\n\nIn June five adult actresses met with Hall's district director, Heather Hutt, at the legislator's office on Artesia Boulevard in Compton and presented 650 signed petitions asking that the Assemblyman withdraw his \"condoms in porn\" bill. At the meeting with Hutt were adult film actresses Nina Hartley, Alex Chance and Anikka Albrite, along with industry newcomers Mia Li and Charli Piper and Michael Stabile, a publicist who has been working with Free Speech Coalition (FSC) and Kink.com on the issue. The group expressed their disappointment with the bill and the fact that it had been created with no input from adult industry representatives. In an interview with AVN magazine, Chance stated the following,\n\nWe told [Hutt] we have our own self-regulation...\" \"We told her we wanted to have our voices heard. They'd had no performer input on this. About condoms and chafing and micro-tears, it didn't seem like she really knew all the details of that. She compared it to a dentist being forced to wear gloves, and maybe it's a little uncomfortable. She didn't realize why we have to have sex from 45 minutes to an hour, sometimes longer, and why that was necessary. She didn't know that the dangers of it, like if the condom breaks, and that we could get more STI's with the micro-tears, and just the condoms in general: Swelling, yeast infections, things of that nature—she just had no idea.\" \"She also didn't know about the doctors with the FSC that help make the decisions,\" Chance added. \"It's not just a couple of people in a building making decisions for the whole industry. They don't even make decisions on the moratoriums; a doctor does, and she had no idea about that and what the testing protocols—how the doctors work with them to make the most safe tests available; she had no idea.\n\nIn the thirty-five minute meeting Director Hutt mentioned that in the 2012 election the most votes cast in any district in favor of passage of Measure B came from Hall's district. Actress Nina Hartley countered that although Measure B and AB 1576 were written by policy makers at AIDS Healthcare Foundation, the AHF had yet to open a clinic in Compton which has one of the highest HIV infection rates in Los Angeles County.\n\nIn 2016, the AIDS Healthcare Foundation backed Proposition 60, which would have enacted a condom mandate similar to Measure B statewide. Proposition 60 was defeated at the polls.\n\nIn January 2013, Universal City-based Vivid Entertainment filed a lawsuit against the Los Angeles County health department saying that the measure violated actors' rights to free speech and expression. In August 2013, U.S. District Judge Dean Pregerson delivered a mixed ruling to the adult film industry saying that while making actors wear condoms during porn shoots does not violate the First Amendment, enforcing such a law raises constitutional questions, and denied the adult film industry's motion for a preliminary injunction.\n\nJudge Pregerson agreed that some of the provisions and language of measure were too vague and did not sufficiently explain condom use when other sex acts were being filmed. He also questioned the manner of inspections to be conducted and agreed with the industry that their rights could be violated. Pregerson wrote, \"Given that adult filming could occur almost anywhere, Measure B would seem to authorize a health officer to enter and search any part of a private home in the middle of the night, because he suspects violations are occurring. This is unconstitutional because it is akin to a general warrant...\".\n\nBoth sides considered the judgment a victory. Vivid Entertainment founder and co-chairman Steven Hirsch said in a statement that he is pleased with the decision regarding the enforcement questions, but plans to appeal the part of the ruling that upholds the measure. He stated, \"We won most everything we sought to be determined unconstitutional with Measure B. We are, however, disappointed the Court found it necessary to rewrite a portion of the measure in order to salvage a small portion of the measure and refused, at this time, to accept the adult industry's own regulations by imposing an unfunded mandate upon the county by AHF.\" AIDS Healthcare Foundation president Michael Weinstein stated, \"Today's ruling that requiring condoms in porn is constitutional is just a tremendous, tremendous victory, one that will go a long way to safeguard the health and safety of those adult performers working in the industry.\" Vivid filed an appeal.\n\nIn March 2014, the appeal of Judge Pregerson's ruling was argued before the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals, with a three-judge panel asking questions to both the appellants and the appellee, which was the AIDS Healthcare Foundation (AHF) rather than the lawsuit's official defendant, Los Angeles County. The panel was headed by Ninth Circuit Chief Justice Alex Kozinski, Circuit judge Susan P. Graber, a Clinton appointee, and Judge Jack Zouhary of the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Ohio, a George W. Bush appointee.\n\nOn December 15, the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals affirmed a lower court's order denying a motion to overturn the Measure. In the ruling, it was stated \"that the district court did not abuse its discretion in holding that the invalid portions of Measure B (allowing for modification, suspension, and revocation of permits; authorizing administrative searches; and allowing discretion in setting fees) were severable\". The effect of which is that court upheld the portions of the Measure which were not struck down by U.S. District Court Judge Pregerson. The court also took the position that \"the condom mandate ... has only a de minimis (negligible) effect on expression.\" According to AVN magazine legal analyst Mark Kernes this position ignores \"the fact that historically, every company that has adopted a mandatory condom policy has experienced a drop in sales, which translates to a decreased ability to have its message seen by the public.\"\n\nRegarding the ruling, Diane Duke, CEO of the Free Speech Coalition, stated,\n\nWhile this intermediate decision allows that condoms may be mandated, it doesn't mean they should be. We have spent the last two years fighting for the rights of adult performers to make their own decisions about their bodies, and against the stigma against adult film performers embodied in the statute. Rather than protect adult performers, a condom mandate pushes a legal industry underground where workers are less safe. This is terrible policy that has been defeated in other legislative venues.\n\nAHF president Michael Weinstein stated,\n\nToday's ruling is a total vindication of AHF's position. We call on Los Angeles County for full enforcement of this law now. As the lower court said, they need to set fees based on actual cost. The porn industry has considered every option but following the law. Now it's time to do what fifty-seven percent of Los Angeles County voters have asked of the industry—and what the courts have upheld as constitutional.\n\nHe further stated that he hoped the adult entertainment industry will continue to appeal, taking the case to the U.S. Supreme Court, for a final and definitive ruling.\n\n"}

{"id": "57224952", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=57224952", "title": "Platt Report 1959", "text": "Platt Report 1959\n\nThe Platt Report, formerly called the Welfare of Sick Children in Hospital (Ministry of Health, 1959) was a report, that was the result of research into the welfare of children who were undergoing medical treatment within the UK, and to make suggestions that could be passed on to the hospital authorities that would improve their welfare during hospital visits. The report was named after Sir Harry Platt. Platt who was the President of the Royal College of Surgeons, produced the report at the behest of the Ministry of Health in the UK government. The recommendations in the Platt Report, provided the means by which a child trauma ward of a hospital should be planned for children. Established on 12 June 1956, the committee that was to produce the report defined their remit as:\n\nThe findings of the report by the committee, was that hospitals were miserable places for children, and while in hospital, they had to follow strict ward routine, and were not allowed to play. Moreover, the most grievous of the findings, was that parents were, under no circumstances, allowed to visit their children outside visiting hours.\n\nThe Platt Report was one of several reports in the United Kingdom that have been produced which clearly state the psychosocial and emotional needs of children in hospital and the community. The Court Report was produced in 1976, by Donald Court, which proposed the most radical change in the medical care of children this century. Newer reports included the Welfare of Children and Young People in 1991, Children First in 1993, Child Health in the Community that was produced in 1996, Specific needs of Children and Young People in 1997 along with in 1997 and finally the Children Act 1989.\n\nMembership of the report committee included two surgeons, two physicians, one nurse and one Registered Sick Children Nurse. Over its lifetime from 1956 to 1958, the committee met 20 times to consider both written and oral evidence, taken from a number of organisations including the Royal College of Physicians and Surgeons of Glasgow, Royal College of Physicians, Royal College of Nursing, the Tavistock Institute and the National association for Maternal and child welfare.\n\nThe \"British Medical Journal\" confirmed in an article on November 18, 1961, that on the previous 9 November, that in reply to a question, in the House of Commons, the Minister of Health, Enoch Powell, accepted the report:\n\nThe Platt Report recommended that children should have unfettered access to their parents while ill. The Association for the Wellbeing of Children in Healthcare (NAWCH) had consistently campaigned over many years for the same position, and conducted ongoing monitoring of the effects of the report. In 1982, the NAWCH conducted a survey throughout England. The survey found that progress was slowly being made and 49% of wards studied allowed unrestricted access for parents. The survey also looked at where children were being nursed and found that despite the recommendations of the Platt Report being broadly accepted by the government in 1959, 28% of children were still being nursed on adult wards. Whilst it may have been anticipated that the parents denied open access to children were those whose children were being nursed on adult wards, the survey show that 48% of children's wards still did not have open access. The children who fared worse were children on ear, nose and throat wards with 24% being denied visits on the day of operation and with many spending up to 36 hours away from their parents.\n\nChanges occurred rapidly from the 1980s onwards, due to a new generation of doctors and nurses who were sympathetic to the recommendations of the report. A follow up study by NAWCH during 1986 showed great improvement, although a detailed look at changes in the interim year showed a few instance where small children's units had closed and children transferred to adult wards. The second survey was, however, on the whole very encouraging with 85% of parents having open access and another 4% of parents on open access except on operating day.\n\nWith the introduction of the \"Leiden charter\" in 1988 from the European Association for Children in Hospital that became a working framework for national paediatric organisations in Europe and the creation of the Convention on the Rights of the Child formalised the Platt report recommendations at the international level.\n\nBy 1993, a report by the Audit Commission, called \"Children First\" showed further improvements had been made, but highlighted the needs of adolescents, indicating that the Platt report recommendations had not been fully implemented.\n\nDuring the first two decades of 21st century, the re-framing of the idea of family centred care to a child-centred care approach was taking place. This approach was directly influenced by the UN convention, which in turn was driven by the Platt Report recommendations. Without the Platt Report directing policy at the national level within the United Kingdom from the 1950s onwards, it would have been unlikely these changes would have taken place. Even now, the Platt report is still considered relevant to the forming of policy that aims to improve childcare and associated services.\n\nTo understand why the Platt Report was produced, and put into effect, an examination of the hospitalization of children, leading up to the mid 1950s must be made. From the 1850s to around 1910, most of the cities in the UK had built their own children's hospitals, which included a large number of prestigious hospitals, e.g. Royal Hospital for Sick Children, Glasgow, Great Ormond Street Hospital and the Royal Manchester Children's Hospital. These were independent institutions funded by voluntary donations, and from research, were shown to be designed for the \"deserving poor\" largely reflecting Victorian values. Children could only be admitted, if they were sponsored by a letter of recommendation, from a hospital affiliate. The \"undeserving poor\" were sent to workhouse infirmaries, whilst middle class children were generally cared for, and indeed operated on, at home. These hospitals set their own rules and had their own way of working, including regulating admissions, that often excluded infants and children under the age of two on humanitarian and pragmatic grounds.\n\nThe Scottish paediatrician George Armstrong, who established the first British dispensary, in 1769, was against in-patient care, i.e. hospitals for sick children. Armstrong stated:\n\nObjections to admission were sometimes based on pragmatic reasons, e.g. reducing the threat of cross infection from children with diseases such as typhus, diphtheria and measles, that were a major cause of infant mortality. The voluntary nature of hospitals meant that such outbreaks were very costly. Babies and small children required more nursing care. However, by the 1880s more and more hospitals were accepting children. By the 1870s, the prevalent view among doctors and nurses that that children were better off by being removed to hospital, away from the often poor, unsanitary conditions at home.\n\nThere were enlightened people like surgeon James Henderson Nicholl of the Glasgow Hospital for Sick Children, who pioneered day surgery procedures such as Hernia and cleft palate and who stated in 1909 that:\n\nNicholl's believed that hospitalization wasn't necessary, and children were better cared from in their own home, both by their parents and by nurses who made daily visits to the children. Nicholl's recognised that \"separation from mother is often harmful\". However, Nicholl's views were in the exception. For almost 50 years, whether children were in a workhouse infirmary, sanatorium or a hospital, they separated from the mothers and families and only visited, on a very strict visit schedule. By the end of the 20th century, children's hospitals had become\n\nWith the rising of behaviourism from the 1900s to the 1950s, children were rarely see as individuals, and they became more of a collective problem to be solved. Behaviourism had many advocates, and amongst the strongest proponents of the philosophy were John B. Watson and Truby King. Watson stated the following advice regarding children:\n\nKing, who promulgated a specific kind of child rearing, advocated that the child had to be breastfed, based on a strict schedule every 4 fours, not to cuddle them, and not to feed babies or children at night, lest they cried and became spoiled. King had became well known, as a child rearing expert during the interwar period, and his advice was widely accepted by the medical community. By the 1920s, hospitals were grim places for children, and only addressed the physical needs of the child, never noticing the emotional and psychological needs.\n\nHowever, there were dissenting voices, both for those who had started to question the tenets of behaviourism, and those who already recognized the unique link between the child and their mother, who would nurse them in times of ill health and who always felt responsible for the child's recovery. Sir James Calvert Spence began the practice, then unique in Britain, of admitting mothers to hospital with their sick children, so that they might nurse them and feel responsible for the child's recovery. However, as a visionary, Spence was unique in this position, during that period in the 1920s, when he established his resident mother and baby unit in 1926. By the 1930s there was physicians who recognised the need, including Agnes Hunt, who introduced open visiting.\n\nDuring the interwar period, leading up to the World War II, research conduced by people like Harry Edelston and John Bowlby further eroded the importance and veracity of behaviourism. Edelston, a Psychiatrist in Leeds, detailed that children were emotionally damaged by their stay in hospital. In 1939, John Bowlby wrote an open letter to the British Medical Journal which criticized government plans to evacuate a million children from towns and cities to the safety of the countryside. Controversially, Bowlby and his co-signatories pointed out in a letter that the psychological danger of removing children under the age of five years, from their mothers far outweighed the dangers of leaving them in cities.\n\nDespite L.A. Perry's 1947 Lancet article, that vigorously protested the restrictions of parental visits on hospitalized children, Edelston wrote in 1948, that many of this colleagues still refused to believe in \"hospitalisation trauma\" Bowlby would later study 44 juvenile thieves and found that a significantly high number had experienced early and traumatic separation from their mother. Bowlby would use the data in 1949 on the delinquent and affectionless children and the effects of hospitalised and institutionalised care in the commission to write a report for the World Health Organization's on the mental health of homeless children in post-war Europe.\n\nIn the late 1930s, work by René Spitz, an Austrian-American psychoanalyst, confirmed the findings by Edelston, Bowlby and Perry, specifically deleterious effects of hospitalization, based on his research with institutionalized children.\n\nEmpirical research from both America and the United Kingdom now evidenced the premise that maternal deprivation was damaging to the child and this simple fact further challenged the tenets of Behaviourism. During interwar period, there was a growing realization, that the adhoc system of municipal hospitals, many that were former work house infirmaries and voluntary hospitals that provided 25% of care services, no longer provided the level of services that were needed and were no longer considered a \"good fit\" with the needs of the medical community. Indeed, by the 1930s many voluntary hospitals had already become fee-charging institutions.\n\nDuring World War II, the Emergency Medical Service that was established to care for civilian casualties during war, acted as a blueprint for what a future integrated medical care service, in the UK, could look like. With the publication of the Beveridge Report in November 1942, that posited the foundation of a Welfare state as well as an integrated medical care service in the form of a National Health Service, that was subsequently established in 1948, it enabled national policy directives to be applied to the whole service. The Platt Report was one of those directives, designed in a manner, to improve the delivery of care.\n\nWith the introduction of Penicillin into the majority of the medical community by the 1940s, the major objection by doctors and nurses, that visits by parents into hospital wards introduced cross infections had been removed. A major review in 1949, over an 11-month periods showed that children admitted to 26 wards in 14 hospitals showed no correlation between visits and cross infection from parents to children. Indeed, by that time, the working practices of doctors and nurses, still posed the main objection to visiting. Hunt reported that:\n\nHowever, the prevailing view was starting to change. John Bowlby, the British British psychologist, psychiatrist, and psychoanalyst along with his research assistant at the Tavistock Clinic, James Robertson, the Scottish social worker, and psychoanalyst, started researching the separation of young children by their parents. Bowlby was the scientist who developed classic theories about maternal separation. Robertson focused his research on separation of mother and child due to hospital admission.\n\nWhen Robertson first started to make observations of young children in hospital wards, he was shocked by the unhappiness he saw among the youngest children, in particular those aged under 3. The competent, efficient doctors and nurses gave good medical care but seemed unaware of the suffering around them. They saw that children initially protested at separation from the parents, but then settled, becoming quiet and compliant. However, Robertson saw this as a danger signal.\n\nBased on several years of observations in long and short stay wards, Bowlby and Robertson formed a theory of phases of response of the under 3's to a stay in hospital without the mother: Protest, Despair and Denial/Detachment. In the protest phase, the child is visibly distressed, cries and calls for their mother. In the despair phase, the child gives up hope of his mother returning and becomes withdrawn and quiet, and may appear to be 'settling'. In the denial/detachment phase, the child shows more interest in his surroundings and interacts with others - but seems hardly to know the mother when she visits or care when she leaves. Finally, the child seems not to need any mothering at all. His relationships with others are shallow and untrusting.\n\nBowlby's and Robertson's research was met with hostility by the medical profession. Even their colleagues at the Tavistock Clinic, although accepting, did not feel the same sense of urgency.\n\nIn 1951, Bowlby and Robertson attempted to get their views across, by presenting to the British Paediatric Association but these views were rejected. Instead Robertson decided to take a different tack, by making a short, silent, black and white, documentary film in November 1952, called A Two-Year-Old Goes to Hospital\n\nUsing a hand-held camera, Robertson working with his wife Joyce Robertson, a researcher, selected a little girl, called Laura, aged 2 years and 5 months, who was admitted to hospital, for the removal of tonsils, a common operation in those days. Laura was initially composed, until she realised her mother had actually left her there, and the film shows how she developed acute and continuous distress... Laura pleaded to be taken home, but as her protests and pleadings were useless, they were gradually followed by despair. She became listless, unsmiling and her traumatised emotional state was heart-rendingly clear, and on those occasions when her mother did visit during the eight days she was in hospital, Laura would turn away from her.\n\nRobertson's film was show to the Royal Society of Medicine on 28 November 1952, before a large audience of doctors and nurses. Donald Winnicott on seeing the film spoke of \"highly successful film\" that dealt with a \"real problem\" and evidenced the fact that he himself had seen irreversible change as a result of the separation of small children from their mothers. Both the editors of The Lancet and The BMJ discussed the meeting. The BMJ agreed that the 2-year-old girl was unhappy, and that this was in line with the findings of John Bowlby. The Lancet stated that the audience frankly refused to admit that the child was distressed and were reluctant to believe that it might cause long term damage. Robertson's memory of the meeting, was that \"it was if we had dropped a bomb in the hall\" and that \"the film encountered much resistance and rejection\". The speakers also supposedly also said that Robertson \"had slandered paediatrics and the film should be withdrawn\". Two people who were at the meeting were Donald Winnicott and Sister Ivy Morris from Amersham Hospital and they agreed to a second filming on their ward. Robertson later took film and viewed it to American paediatricians in 1953, but curiously American audiences confirmed that the film findings were applicable to British children, but they did not apply to American children, and were perhaps less cared for and protected in an overindulgent way, and were therefore less upset at being separated from their parent. However, Robertson's subsequent research in the United States merely confirmed his findings, and showed that on both sides of the Atlantic, there were those who were in favour of unrestricted visiting, and those who were not. Robertson eventually viewed the film to paediatricians and other healthcare professionals in the United Kingdom, France, Denmark, Netherlands, Norway and Yugoslavia. Robertson noticed that younger professionals were more accepting of the evidence, while senior professionals tended to reject the film.\nRobertson's successor film was called, Going to Hospital with Mother. Robertson chose Amersham Hospital specifically, as every mother of a child under 5 years was invited to come into residence in the hospital, without discriminating between good mothers and over-anxious mothers. Bowlby and Robertson created a film, which was more about the study of human relationship, and showed how children responded differently to treatment when mother was present and how the staff of one hospital had created a way of admitting the mother with the child without making structural changes to the ward. The second film was based on Sally, who is 20 months old, and is lively and funny. When attending hospital for a minor operation, she arrives with her mother. When the surgeon calls, Sally protests, but with her mother there, her protest is brief. The film follows Sally throughout the hospital visit with her mother present throughout. When Sally returns home, she has none of the attendant disturbed behaviour of those who have been in hospital without their mother. Even though the film was shown widely, the pace of progress was still glacial. Indeed, The Lancet reported in 1956, that only 10% of hospital now restricted visiting, even though the Minister of Health Robin Turton was repeatedly asking for changes.\n\nThe glacial process resulted in pressure being bought to bear by both James and Joyce Robertson with other doctors and parents against the medical establishment, and resulted in Robin Turton commissioninng the Central Health Services Council, that was part of the Ministry of Health, to establish a committee to undertake a special study of the arrangements made in hospital for children and the very young and to make recommendations to those hospitals, in the form of a report. The Terms of Reference for the production of the report was:\n\nThe report was commissioned on 12 June 1956. Sir Harry Platt, who was a former president of the Royal College of Surgeons of England was chosen to be Chairman of the committee. The committee met 20 times to take evidence from both sides of the debate in a manner that was scrupulously fair. Both parents and health professionals as well as children's organisations including charities gave evidence. The Association of British Paediatric Nurses provided evidence to the contrary, arguing for the status quo, that frequent visitors bought infection into the ward. Both James Robertson and John Bowlby also provided evidence. James Robertson appeared in front of the committee with Dermod MacCarthy to show his film \"A Two-Year-Old Goes to Hospital\", but upon requesting the BBC to show the film nationally, were refused, as the BBC had consulted medical opinion, which agreed that the film would cause anxiety to parents. However, the evidence provided by James and Joyce Robertson was extremely influential to the final recommendations of the report. The final report was sent to Lord Cohen of Birkenhead, Chair of the Central Health Services Council on 28 October 1958.\n\nThe Platt Report was made up of four sections, dealing with preparation for admission, admission procedure, in-patient care and patient discharge, respectively. The Report had profound and lasting effects on the welfare of children, not only with the United Kingdom, but in other countries like New Zealand, Australia, Canada and the United States. The main recommendations of the report were:\n\n\nDuring the twenty years after the Platt Report, parents wanting to visit their sick child who were formerly excluded, moved to parents being tolerated by the medical community when they wanted to visit their sick child and this was a break from what could be considered tradition and a move towards a more humanitarian viewpoint. James Robertson continued to research the problem and to share his findings. He wrote four influential articles for The Observer and The Guardian newspapers to disseminate his ideas, and the issue started to gain traction. In 1961, the BBC agreed to show excerpts of \"A Two-Year-Old Goes to Hospital\" and his other films and Robertson gave an live introduction to the films and asked parents to submit their experiences of hospital care to him. The stories Robertson received from the parents were published in 1962 in a book called \"Hospitals and Children:A Parent's-Eye View\". Harry Platt himself wrote the foreword to book.\n\nJane Thomas, a young mother living in Battersea, contacted Robertson, to ask what she would do if her own child was hospitalised, and Robertson suggested forming an organisation, which Thomas and a group of women did. The organisation was called the Mother Care for Children in Hospital and was founded in 1961. Thomas sent a letter to The Guardian detailing her experiences, and the responses allowed the organisation to grow and campaign for the full implementation of the report. Soon regional groups appeared all over the UK and these amalgamated in 1963, and became the National Association for the Welfare of Children in Hospital (NAWCH) in 1965. Although the Platt Report was accepted by the Ministry of Health and government, they were under no legal obligation to implement the report. In this manner, the NAWCH became a pressure and advocate group, applying pressure both on the government and the nursing profession, which throughout the 1960s and 1970s continued to resist the new recommendations, and advocating for sick children and their families. The NAWCH developed a series of techniques to get hospitals to relax their strict rules. One of these techniques was carrying out surveys of all hospitals, which found that although the hospital said they allowed unrestricted visiting, the reality would be different. One hospital reported they allowed unrestricted visiting, \"but not in the mornings\". Another stated, that \"It was the aim of the board of Governors to have unrestricted visiting, as long as the parents understand that they can't be in the wards all the time.\" Otorhinolaryngology wards were particularly bad, often getting parents to sign a consent form, that made them agree not to visit the child on the day of operation. Another technique was to recruit sympathetic doctors and nurses who could advocate for change. The NAWCH drew attention to these practices by issuing press releases detailing their findings and providing leaflets to parents when visiting hospitals that allowed unrestricted visits, telling them of this fact. By 1969, a NAWCH survey of 67 hospitals showed that only 57% allowed unrestricted visiting. The same picture emerged regarding the results of survey of 636 hospitals in the United States, reporting only 62% allowed unrestricted visiting.\n\nWith a desire to seek a more benevolent approach to the care of children in hospital, changes occurred that led to a broader trend within the development work. In Toronto, the Hospital for Sick Children was at the forefront of this approach, when it introduced a blueprint to enable parents to care for their children. The kind of approach developed in Toronto was called \"Rooming-in\", and described a hospital unit at St. Michael's Hospital in Toronto, where both the mother and father look after their new born baby in a room where both mother and baby are cared for together. The \"Rooming-in\" concept as a philosophy of family centred care was later adopted in Canada. A good example of this was developed at McMaster University in 1969, in building a new Health Science Centre. Nursing staff arranged visits to specialised facilities for the architects of the centre, enabling the nursing unit and nursery design to be changed to incorporate the \"Rooming-in\" concept to be adopted at the centre. In the 1960s, the \"Care-by-parents\" model was being developed with the first unit developed and established in Lexington, Kentucky. In these \"Care-by-parents\" units, parents would live with their sick child. This model was developed to both safe money and quality of care, under the supervision of a nurse. The \"Care-by-parents\" room was designed with en-suite facilities. Coffee and tea making machines were provided with laundry facilities. In these units, parents were taught to care for their child and were particularly beneficial for babies who were being breast fed. For that model, the role and expectations of the parents were outlined on admission. In findings by Clearly et all in a structured observational study, found that children in these units spent less time alone, slept less and cried less. In contrast those children outwith the units, spent time with an ever-changing group of nurses, spent more time alone, spent more time sleeping and cried more. For chronically ill or handicapped children, the benefits of these units were more apparent in terms of shorter and fewer visits. The study noted that where a care by parent option could be introduced into a paediatric unit, it had a distinct social and psychological advantages for the children in hospital as well as longer term benefits. In a 1968 study by Brain and Maclay's in the University Hospital of Wales in the United Kingdom, 197 children who underwent tonsillectomy and adenoidectomy were split into three control groups. The study found that children without a resident parent did sleep more than the others, children who in the scheme cried less in total than the others outside it, and that nursing staff spent less time with the care by parent group that with the others despite the demands of teaching and support. It also found that children who were accompanied by their mother had significantly lower rates of post-operative complications, including infection and emotional distress, than those who were unaccompanied. However, nurses involved in the study still preferred the children to be admitted on their own, but also admitted that mothers were a great help to their children, but felt it was much easier to carry out the medical procedure when the child was left on their own, which enabled the nurse to have a closer contact with the child. Research also showed, that 4% of mothers were difficult to handle by the nursing staff\n\nThe seminal report by Pamela Hawthorn, published in 1974 and called \"Nurse, I want my mummy!\" changed the face of patient care in the UK. Commenting on the report in the BBC article, Professor Martin Johnson, professor of nursing at the University of Salford, stated of the report that:\n\nHawthorn investigated nursing care in 11 hospitals, used qualified nurses who asked questions from standardised questionnaires to gather the research, and found that unrestricted nursing times ranged from the full days access to just a few hours a day. In wards that recognised and implemented Platt's recommendations, it was found that children were less likely to be lonely or miserable. The most important finding from the study and what prevented the widespread uptake of Platt's recommendations was the lack of Registered Sick Children's Nurses (RSCN) on the wards. Hawthorn's report found that only 575 RSCN nurses were being trained annually in the 1960s and 1970s, which was insufficient to ensure that every children's emotional and psychological needs were being addressed properly while in ward.\n\nBy the 1980s it was obvious to observers that the situation was changing in respect of the ability of parents to visit their sick children in hospital and care for them. Pressure groups like the National Association for the Welfare of Children in Hospital worked tirelessly to push back the boundaries of care, and influenced the development of advocacy in the wider social contract. In 1982, an NAWCH survey was conducted that looked at access on children's wards throughout England by Rosemary Thornes. The report found that 49% of wards studied allowed unrestricted access for parents. The report looked at where children were being nursed and found that despite what the Platt Report recommended, 28% of children were still being nursed on adult wards, and that 48% of children's wards still did not have open access. The children who fared worse were those on the otorhinolaryngology wards, with 24% being denied visits on the day of the visit, with many children spending up to 36 hours away from their parents. It was clear that attitudes were changing as a new generation of doctors and nursings arrived, that naturally accepted the findings of the Platt report, but were stymied by outdated processes, infrastructure and traditional attitudes.\n\nIn 1984, the National Association for the Welfare of Children in Hospital decided to issue a charter to reflect their values and in order to raise the quality of services for children. Jenny Davison of the NAWCH wrote that it was \"formulated by procedures which have become a model for later standard setting\". The charter was constructed of 10 principles, with e.g. principle 2 stating that \"Children in hospital shall have the right to have their parents with them at all times. (with caveats)\". Principle 3 stated that it was the child had the \"right to information appropriate to age and understanding\". The charter was approved by the Royal College of Nursing (RCN) and the British Paediatric Association (RCPCH). The Sainsbury report,\n\nA study by the NAWCH in 1986 showed huge improvements in the proportion of wards with entirely unrestricted access for parents with 85% of wards allowing open access to parents, but estimated that only 67% of parents were welcomed, and 24% only accepted and 9% only tolerated. The study report also stated that where small children's units had been closed, the children had been transferred into adult wards. The 1988 study by Rosemary Thornes, for the NAWCH, supported by the RCN and the RCPCH recommended that all parents under the age of five years should be offered overnight accommodation.\n\nDuring the 1980s, the medical community continued to research the problem domain, identifying the benefits of parents caring for their children both with the UK and internationally. The Keane report, 1986, found that that a number of resident parents in hospital perceived their children as temperamentally vulnerable, and needed special reassurance and explanation. The Sainsbury report, 1986, found that nurses believed that their work role was enhanced, and that most parents coped with caring duties, and were grateful for being considered important in the process of healing. International research focused on different aspects of parent-child care. A Canadian report of 1983, by Evans and Robinson focused on the economic aspects of care-by-parent units by a parent's stay on the ward can reduce costs by resuming nursing tasks, limiting unnecessary procedures, and encouraging early discharge An American report by Stull and Deatrick in 1986, tried to find a methodology for measuring the effectiveness of parental participation in the care of the hospitalized child. The process used was for 24 parents to be tested with 11 parental involvement activities and the research submitted to 19 experts for analysis. The 11 categories were then to subject to metrics to identify their effectiveness of focus on the activity. An Irish report in 1989, by Taylor and Connor also looked at the reduction in costs associated with parents caring for their child in hospital. The report found that hospital visits were 31% shorter than those whose parents were not resident, representing a shorter stay in hospital, and a saving as well as meeting the needs of the child, including less emotionally disturbing time spent in hospital visits.\n\nAlthough research was being conducted in the 1980s to explore the different benefits of parents caring for their children both within hospital, within the community and at home, and were wholly accepting of the Platt report, the British government had a restored focus on the needs of both young and adolescent children, due to a number of sentinel events, that occurred during the late 1980s and early 1990s with the Platt Report being referred to during proceedings. This resulted in the UK government allocating additional funding to train more Registered Sick Children's Nurse's (RSCN). This one action sped up efforts to achieve the full implementation of the Platt Report in the UK.\n\nIn the international stage, events were occurring that was progressing both the implementation and acceptance of the Platt report recommendations. The European Association for Children in Hospital (EACH), was an umbrella association representing a number of member associations involved in the welfare of all children in Europe. In 1988, twelve of the member associations of EACH, met in Leiden and created a charter, based on the recommendations of the Platt report and the charter created in 1984 by the Action for Sick Children charity, the new name of the NAWCH. The NAWCH changed names in 1990. The \"Leiden Charter\", as it was colloquially named, became a working framework for the national associations that were part of the EACH. The Leiden charter consisted of 10 points. and was eventually ratified by 16 European countries and Japan.\n\nOther events were taking place at the same frame as Leiden charter. The United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child was ratified by the UK 16 December 1991, and most of the rest of the world as well, except the United States. Somalia was the last state to finally ratified it on January 2015. The convention not only dealt with the specific needs and rights of children, but also decided that states must act under the principle of best interests of the child, specifically in this context of not being separated from their parents. Signers are bound under international law. That is defined under Article 3 of the convention.\n\nDuring the first two decades of the 21st century, the re-framing of the idea of family centred care to a child-centred care (CCC) approach was taking place.\n\nThe child centred approach is an evolution of family centred care, but neither approach can exclude the other, with CCC recognising the critical importance of parents. The recognition of the idea of the child as active member and equal, meant the child was to be included in the care partnership, defining a conceptual relationship as \"child in family\" rather than \"child and family\". The relationship was not \"either/or\" but \"either/and\". \n\nThe child-centred approach is cognizant of the fact that the child has their own ideas and can make choices, that are in the best interest of the themselves, i.e. being an active member in the partnership. Recent research has show that children are capable of learning skills as healthcare members, the ability to effectively communicate with both health professionals and parents, defining goals, and using decisions to get the best possible outcome. \n\nAlthough agreement on the definition of child centred care has proven elusive, some principles of child of the approach have been defined\n\n\nFor much of the 20th century, healthcare has been one of the many contexts in which the child has disenfranchised, and denied their right to participation in their own care. With the release of the Platt report, this slowly changed, until family centred and later child centred care became well understood. However, even now the full recommendations of the Platt report have not been implemented. For example, where similar standards are in place, the co-location of children within adult wards is common.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "30515922", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=30515922", "title": "Pollution in Canada", "text": "Pollution in Canada\n\nPollution is an environmental issue in Canada. It has posed health risks to the Canadian population and is an area of concern for Canadian lawmakers. Air, water and soil pollution as well as the health effects associated with these three types of pollution, are prominent points of contention in modern Canadian society.\n\nAir pollution in Canada is contributed by industrial and vehicular emissions, agriculture, construction, wood burning and energy production. A recent report found that Canadian companies contributed 73% more to air pollution than companies in the United States. Within the 73% more emissions it was found that Canadian companies contributed 29% more respiratory toxins into the air than the U.S.\" While Canadian businesses may release more emissions than those in the U.S, overall emissions have decreased in the past few years. This can be evidenced with Environment Canada's 2010 document named Air Pollutant Emission Summaries and Historical Emission Trends. This report found that 2010 emissions, when compared to 2009 emissions, saw an overall decrease. Additionally, it was found that heavy metals and persistent organic pollutants (smog precursors) were at lower levels in 2010 than in 1990.\n\nWhile overall pollution levels have dropped, it was found that oil sands pollution has increased by 20% since 2009. According to a 2009 study, Alberta’s oil sands are one of the major causes of air pollution in Canada. Tar sands facilities were found to be among the top four highest polluters of volatile organic compounds (VOCs)- a major air contaminant. VOCs and other air contaminants are set to increase in the future as a result of continued output from the oil sands. Oil sands pollution is not only set to increase VOCs, but also, acid rain. Acid rain is rain that has been contaminated by airborne chemicals, making it acidic. Two major causes of acid rain are sulphur dioxide and nitrogen oxide. Acid rain can cause damage to soil, water, wildlife, plants and buildings. Additionally, the airborne particles that cause acid rain can also contribute to smog. In recent years progress has been made in reducing acid rain, however, Alberta's oil sands may soon set back this progress.\n\nIn southeastern Saskatchewan, air pollution from oil production has breached provincial air quality standards hundreds of times since 2014.\n\nIn recent years, the Canada-United States Air Quality Agreement, signed on 13 March 1991, has improved air quality by reducing sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxide emissions in both countries. The agreement was meant to address the issue of transnational air pollution between the two countries. The agreement was expanded in 2000 to also include goals of reducing emissions of volatile organic compounds and levels of ground-level ozone. Ground-level ozone is caused by reactions between nitrogen oxides and VOCs in the presence of sunlight. Ozone is a contributor to smog and is known to cause numerous respiratory diseases. The 2012 Canada-United States Air Quality Agreement Progress Report found that \"Canada's total emissions of sulfur dioxide have decreased by 57% from 1990 levels while the U.S. has reduced total sulfur dioxide emissions from covered sources by 67% from their 1990 emission levels. Between 2000 and 2010, Canada reduced total emissions of nitrogen oxides by 40% in the transboundary ozone region while U.S. total nitrogen oxide emissions decreased by 42% in the region\".\n\nWhile transnational pollution between the United States and Canada has decreased many Canadians still say they contend with polluted air as a result of drifting pollution from the U.S. In 2006 the government of Ontario announced that \"5,000 premature deaths caused by smog in the province every year can be attributed to air pollution that crosses the Canada-U.S. border.\" Additionally, the then (2006) mayor of Halifax, Peter Kelley, also proclaimed \"over 50 per cent of air pollutants over New Brunswick and Nova Scotia are from the U.S. For us, we're trying to deal with what's coming our way, but also what we generate here as well.\" In an attempt to combat the pollution a petition was created. In 2006 the petition was filed by thirteen Canadian municipalities to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency calling for a reduction in coal-fired plants.\n\nThe Climate Change Accountability Act called for greenhouse gas emissions to be 25% below 1990 levels by 2020, and 80% below 1990 levels by 2050. Although the bill was passed by the House of Commons, the bill was defeated by the Senate. Environment Minister Jim Prentice stated in early 2010 that the new goal for greenhouse gas emissions would be 17% below 2005 levels by 2020, the equivalent of a 3% increase from 1990.\n\nWater pollution is not a major problem nationally, although it can be a source of concern in some localities. Major causes of water pollution in Canada include acid rain, groundwater contamination and unclean wastewater.\n\nAs previously stated, Alberta's oil sands are set to cause growing levels of acid rain consequentially leading to an increase in water contamination in the area. Acid rain will cause Canada's lakes and rivers to become further acidified. This is a problem as it decreases levels of surface water calcium. This lower concentration of calcium is already having particularly adverse effects on plant life, as can be seen with the Daphnia species-an important food source for aquatic species and marine life.\n\nA recent study at the University of Alberta found levels of metals like arsenic, lead and mercury to be considerably higher than national guidelines in water downstream from Albertan oil sites. This pollution could potentially result in harmful health implications for fish and other wildlife. The study further discerned that their findings were \"contrary to claims made by industry and government\" who purported that \"pollutants are from natural sources and not from the expanding production of oil from tar sands.\"\n\nOther than contributing to acid rain and high levels of metals in water, sites of oil production can also cause significant damage by human error and runoff. A prominent example is the 2007 case involving the Athabasca River. Due to human error, energy magnate Suncor spilled 9.8 million liters of oil sands waste water into the river causing adverse effects for people and wildlife in the area. The Athabasca River can also be used as an example of oil sands runoff. It was found that the Athabasca's waters, which are downstream from the oil sands, had higher concentrations of pollutants as a result of runoff. High concentrations of pollutants can have serious consequences for wildlife and humans. Recently, it was reported that there were significant increases in fish deformities as well as an increase in cancer rates in a Native community downstream from the Athabasca.\n\nPollution of the Great Lakes, the world’s biggest bodies of fresh water, continue to be a significant problem for both Canada and the United States. According to Derek Stack, executive director of Great Lakes United, \"High pollution levels in the Great Lakes basin continue to take an apparent toll on the air and water quality of the ecosystem.\" \nIn 2002, it was reported that the Great Lakes basin was home to 45% of all toxic air pollution in Canada, in turn affecting the Great Lakes' water. An even more recent report suggests that the Alberta oil sands' impact could reach as far as the Great Lakes. The report warns that \"[oil] refineries will be using the Great Lakes ‘as a cheap supply’ source for their copious water needs and the area’s air ‘as a pollution dump'.\"\n\nIn September 2012, the United States and Canada signed amended version of the Great Lakes Water Quality Agreement. The overarching purpose of the Agreement is to \"restore and maintain the chemical, physical and biological integrity of the waters\". Significant amendments made to the Agreement include \"address[ing] aquatic invasive species, habitat degradation and the effects of climate change, and support continued work on existing threats to people's health and the environment in the Great Lakes Basin such as harmful algae, toxic chemicals, and discharges from other vessels\". However, some people contend that the changes made to the Agreement while good in principle, lack the \"hard number goals, and actions to reach them.\"\n\nUnder the 1970 Arctic Waters Pollution Prevention Act, the Canadian government established a document to prevent pollution of Canadian Arctic waters. However, in recent years Arctic waters have become increasingly polluted. It was recently found that due to pollution some waters have levels of lead that are higher than the Canadian guidelines.\n\nCoastal communities that emit waste also contribute to arctic pollution. Arctic coastal communities do not presently have the infrastructure necessary to properly deal with their waste, this could lead to greater pollution in the future as these communities continue to grow in size. Other than coastal communities, waste and litter from the rest of the world continues to be a significant issue in the Arctic, with waste levels doubling in the past ten years. The most significant types of litter found are plastic items and plastic bags.\n\nThe Guidelines for Canadian Drinking Water Quality are guidelines for drinking water quality standards in Canada developed by Health Canada. These guidelines set forth recommendations for the maximum concentrations of various substances in drinking water. Provinces and territories are responsible for enforcing these guidelines, as there is no national regulatory body for drinking water. Water pollution by sewage is one of the main culprits involved in polluting drinking water. Advocacy group Ecojustice estimates overall raw sewage dumping in Canada to be around 200 billion litres a year. The Canadian government recently announced waste water regulations that would allow for sewage to be dumped into Canadian waters until 2040. Proper measures for waste water disposal will not immediately be put in place, rather, they will be implemented gradually from 2020 to 2040. However, in the meantime, Canadian municipalities may continue to pollute their waters by dumping sewage. This can prominently be viewed with Halifax, Nova Scotia. In Halifax, human waste is dumped directly into the Halifax harbour. This dumping can mainly be attributed to a failure in their sewage treatment infrastructure. Victoria, British Columbia also follows a similar practice by getting rid of their untreated waste into the ocean. However, the government has plans to open operational treatment facilities for 2016.\n\nWater pollution resulting from sewage can also be attributed to error in sewage facilities. A recent example can be evidenced with Ottawa. In 2004 Ottawa experienced a 190 million liter raw sewage spill into the Ottawa River. Similarly, Winnipeg, released \"partially treated sewage water into the Red River for seven weeks\" in 2011. However, in this case, the city was actually charged for their pollution. Numerous other places like Richmond B.C and Calgary A.B, have experienced significant sewage spills in their native waters.\n\nWhile soil pollution is present in Canada, it is not yet an area of great national concern. Some of the main causes of soil pollution include chemical/oil spills into the ground, road salt, excessive pesticide use by farmers, acid rain, and polluted water.\n\nAs Environment Canada mentions \"soil degradation degrades the land and places significant stress on ecologically sensitive biota and flora\". Soil degradation in Canada's biologically sensitive forests as a result of pollution, is one of the most significant cases of degradation in the country. One study found that 12% of Alberta's forests’ soils are over their acid carrying capacity. This rise in acidity is attributed to the continual extraction of fossil fuel from the Alberta oil sands. Oil refinery sites, like those found in Alberta, have become some of the most dominant contributors to Canadian soil pollution. A further example can be witnessed in Calgary, where a neighbourhood built on an old Imperial Oil refinery needed their soil replaced due to contamination.\n\nAs a result of Canada's icy winters, salt is needed in order to deice slippery roads. The primary ingredient of road salt is sodium chloride. Road salt, while helping cars and people to gain traction in the winter, can have serious consequences for soil. As National Geographic found, \"Road salt can pollute soil at every stage in the deicing process.\" This pollution is a result of numerous factors such as runoff, application and spray from vehicles. In Canada, there has been research that shows that \"salt run-off from roads can increase local chloride levels to between 100 and 4,000 times normal levels.\" Salt can have adverse effects on soil and soil composition. Significant levels of chloride (one of the main components in salt) can \"alter the soil ‘s pH chemistry and elevate levels of heavy metal pollutants, while at the same time causing a loss of soil structure and killing off micro-organisms\". These effects can have dire consequences for plants rendering them unable to grow or stunting their growth.\n\nSalt and oil refineries are not the only contaminants of soil. Polychlorinated biphenyls or PCBs also pollute the soil. PCBs are released into the environment through \"spills, leaks from electrical and other equipment, and improper disposal and storage\". However, recently it was found that household weeds were able to remove PCBs from contaminated soil. A study found that \"the weeds stored PCBs in their shoots and could be harvested for disposal cutting the need to expensively remove and incinerate contaminated soil\".\n\nPollution is associated with numerous negative health effects in humans.\n\nAir pollution has been shown to negatively effect humans' cardiovascular and respiratory systems. Lung tissue can be damaged with direct exposure to air pollutants such as ozone, potentially causing lung inflammation and impairment of lung function. As Environment Canada mentions \"impacts from exposure can range from \"minor breathing problems to premature death\". Some of the main respiratory diseases caused by air pollution include asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and lung cancer. Specific cardiovascular disease and problems caused by air pollution include heart attack, hypertension, inflammation around the heart, stroke and arrhythmias.\n\nHealth Canada estimates that 5,900 Canadians die every year from air pollution. A 2008 study by the Canadian Medical Association estimated that almost 3,000 Canadians die annually from short-term exposure to air pollution, while another 18,000 die annually due to long-term effects of polluted air. The study estimated the economic impact of air pollution to be at $8 billion, including lost productivity, health care costs, deaths and a decrease in quality of life.\n\nContaminated water can result in a myriad of serious consequences for human health.\n\nAdditives used to clean drinking water may cause themselves harm. Chlorine, widely used in Canadian drinking water, is a prominent example. Through drinking water treated by chlorine over a long period of time, the risk of certain cancers, such as bladder and colon, increase. Additionally, pregnant women who drink significant amounts of tap water have an increased risk of miscarriage.\n\nDrinking polluted water can also result in E. coli (as found in the 2000 outbreak in Walkerton), Giardia, or Cryptosporidium.\n\nSoil pollution also causes numerous diseases. Some of the most prominent are cancer, kidney disease, liver disease, dysentery, skin infections, and stomach infections.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "607226", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=607226", "title": "Preventive war", "text": "Preventive war\n\nA preventive war is a war or military action initiated to prevent another party from acquiring a capability for attacking. The party being attacked has either a latent threat capability or has shown through its posturing that it intends to follow through with a future attack. Preventive war aims to forestall a shift in the balance of power by strategically attacking before the balance of power has had a chance to shift in the favour of the adversary. Preventive war is distinct from preemptive strike, which is first strike when an attack is imminent. \n\nSome commentators argue that a preventive strike undertaken without the approval of the United Nations is illegal under the modern framework of international law, though Robert Delahunty and John Yoo from the George W. Bush administration maintained in their discussion of the Bush Doctrine that these standards are unrealistic.\n\nAdvocates of preventive war have ranged from Posadist Communists, who argued for war to destroy capitalism, to western neo-conservatives such as George W. Bush and Donald Rumsfeld, who argued that preventive war is necessary in today's post September 11th world. Proponents claim it has been used throughout American history and is especially relevant in the present as it relates to unconventional war tactics and weapons of mass destruction. The National Security Strategy advocates a policy of proactive counterproliferation efforts, and preventive measures.\n\nThere is a consensus that preventive war \"goes beyond what is acceptable in international law\" and lacks legal basis. While the UN High Level Panel on Threats, Challenges and Change stopped short of rejecting the concept outright, it suggested that there is no right to preventive war. If there are good grounds for initiating preventive war, the matter should be put to the Security Council, which can authorize such action.\n\nThe Axis in World War II routinely invaded neutral countries on grounds of prevention, and began their invasion of Poland in 1939 by claiming the Poles had attacked a border outpost first. In 1940, Germany invaded Denmark and Norway, arguing that Britain might have used them as launching points for an attack, or prevented supply of strategic materials to Germany. Then in the summer of 1941, Germany invaded the Soviet Union, inaugurating this bloody and brutal land war by claiming a Judeo-Bolshevik conspiracy threatened the Reich. In late 1941, the British and Soviets invaded Iran to secure a supply corridor of petrol to the USSR. The Shah of Iran appealed to U.S. President Franklin D. Roosevelt for help, but was rebuffed on the grounds that \"movements of conquest by Germany will continue and will extend beyond Europe to Asia, Africa, and even to the Americas, unless they are stopped by military force.\"\n\nPerhaps the most famous example of preventive war is the war in the Pacific, launched when Japan attacked military targets in Pearl Harbor. Many in the U.S. and Japan believed war was inevitable, this belief coupled to the crippling U.S. economic embargo that was rapidly degrading Japanese military capability led the Japanese leadership to believe it was better to have the war as soon as possible.\n\nThe Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor in 1941 was partly motivated by a desire to cripple U.S. naval power in the Pacific in order to allow the Empire of Japan to advance with reduced opposition from the US when it, in order to secure Japanese oil supplies, fought the British Empire and the Dutch Empire for control over the rich East Indian (Dutch East Indies, Malay Peninsula) oil-fields. In 1940, American policies and tension toward Japanese military actions and Japanese expansionism in the Far East increased. For example, in May 1940, the base of the U.S. Pacific Fleet that was stationed on the west coast of the United States was forwarded to an \"advanced\" position at Pearl Harbor, Hawaii.\n\nThe move was opposed by some Navy officials, including their commander, Admiral James Otto Richardson, who was relieved by President Roosevelt. Even so, the Far East Fleet was not significantly reinforced. Another ineffective plan to reinforce the Pacific was a rather late relocation of fighter planes to bases located on the Pacific islands (like Wake Island, Guam, and the Philippines). For a long time, Japanese leaders, especially leaders of the Imperial Japanese Navy, had known that the large military strength and production capacity of the United States posed a long-term threat to Japan's imperialist desires, especially if hostilities broke out in the Pacific. War games on both sides had long reflected these expectations.\n\nThe 2003 invasion of Iraq was claimed as a preemptive war by the Bush administration. Supporters of the war have argued that it was justified, as Iraq harbored Islamic terrorist groups that share a common hatred of Western countries and was suspected to be developing weapons of mass destruction (WMD).\n\nIn support of an attack on Iraq, U.S. President George W. Bush stated in an address to the United Nations on September 12, 2002, that the Iraqi \"... regime is a grave and gathering danger.\" However, despite several years of occupation, the weapons of mass destruction he alleged were not found.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "55862581", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=55862581", "title": "Senior dog diet", "text": "Senior dog diet\n\nSenior dog food diets are pet foods that are catered toward the senior or mature pet population. The senior dog population consists of dogs that are over the age of seven for most dog breeds, though in general large and giant breed dogs tend to reach this life stage earlier when compared to smaller breed dogs who are considered senior at a much later age. Senior dog foods contain nutrients and characteristics that are used to improve the health of the aging dog. Aging in dogs causes many changes to occur physiologically that will require a change in nutrient composition of their diet. A major change that occurs is the decrease in energy requirements which is addressed by lowered caloric content of senior pet foods. Although energy requirements decrease, protein requirements increase as the dog ages. Senior dog foods include a higher protein content as well as highly digestible protein sources to deal with this. Nutrients included for joint and bone health include glucosamine, chondroitin, omega-3 fatty acids as well as two main minerals; calcium and phosphorus. Sources of fiber included in senior dog foods include beet pulp and flax seed as well as fructooligosaccharides (FOS) and mannanoligosaccharides (MOS). These act to increase gastrointestinal health. Brain and cognitive health decline as the dog ages which leads to the inclusion of vitamin E and L-carnitine in senior dog diets to combat this decline. Skin and coat health can also decline in older dogs due to various reasons. The inclusion of linoleic acid as well as vitamin A into senior dog diets helps to improve or maintain the skin and coat of senior dogs. Immune system health is important to maintain in older dogs to prevent the development of various diseases. By including omega-3 and omega-6 fatty acids, vitamin E, β-carotene as well as pre- and pro-biotics, the immune system can be boosted and maintained to help improve overall health. \nThe maintenance energy requirement (MER), or the energy that is required to maintain normal activity, decreases significantly as a result of lean body mass loss in aging dogs. The MER can decrease by up to 25% as dogs age due to this loss. Basal metabolic rate is maintained by lean mass energy expenditure, which accounts for 96% of the function of lean mass. The metabolizable energy, or the amount of available energy which is left after the losses in urine, feces and combustible gas is subtracted, can be found on the food bag or calculated using the modified Atwater equation:\n\nME (kcal/kg) = 10[(3.5 x Crude Protein) + (8.5 x Crude Fiber) + (3.5 x Nitrogen Free Extract)]\n\nThis equation takes into consideration the amount of energy availability from crude protein, crude fiber, and the nitrogen free extract from pet foods in order to calculate the amount of energy the animal is receiving from the food.\n\nIt is important to consider the metabolizable energy content of senior or mature pet foods using this equation, as energy requirements will vary with age.\n\nA dog's requirements for protein increases as a result of a reduced ability to synthesize proteins as it ages. As a result, it is extremely important to not restrict protein consumption to a senior dog as it can be as just as harmful as protein deficiency in young dogs. To ensure good health, it is important to provide dogs with the 22 amino acids which they require. Of these 22 amino acids, 12 can be synthesized. The rest must be provided by good sources of dietary protein in adequate quantities. Good sources of protein include eggs and fish, which have a high biological value. This value describes the percentage of usable amino acids within the protein. It has been recommended that a minimum of 2.55 grams of protein per kilogram of body weight should be fed daily to ensure that protein requirements are met. It is important to understand that protein requirements based on weight are variable and that many factors influence the protein requirements of each senior dog.\n\nJoint deterioration occurs as dogs age. As their joints become less lubricated there is increased friction between the bone and the cartilage. With this increased friction, the cartilage deteriorates and wears away. The reduction of this cushion in the joints causes bone-on-bone contact to occur, causing the animal great discomfort. This can cause various related issues such as altered gaits and changes in activity levels resulting in a greater possibility of obesity and other conditions related to mobility and activity levels.\n\nThere has been research done in human medicine that indicates the positive effect that a combination of chondroitin sulphate and glucosamine can have on moderate-to-severe knee pain. This effect is likely very similar to the effect these two ingredients have on the joints of aging dogs. It is important to note the effects of these supplements is not instant and the aforementioned studies showed approximately a 3-month period between the beginning of supplementation and the reduction of symptoms.\n\nGlucosamine is a building block for the synthesis of cartilage tissue. It is found naturally in the body, mainly in the fluid which surrounds the joints. This can help aging joints by maintaining the cartilage, thus reducing the pain caused by bone-on-bone contact within the joint (this is the primary source of joint pain in aging animals). This will increase the mobility of the dog which is vital for the maintenance of a healthy weight and general body function. There have also been some studies which have showed anti-inflammatory properties of glucosamine which would also help joint function in aging dogs. Glucosamine is usually provided in supplements in the form of glucosamine sulfate, or by the inclusion of chicken meal in the diet, as it contains glucosamine as well as chondroitin.\n\nChondroitin is a major component in the composition of cartilage. It helps the cartilage retain moisture, lubricating the joint and allowing ease of movement of the bone across the cartilage. This reduces the damage to the cartilage over time. Chondroitin is produced naturally in the body but older dogs can often benefit from a supplemental dose of chondroitin. Chondroitin is commonly supplied as a supplement in the form of chondroitin sulfate.\n\nOmega-3 fatty acids include docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) and eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA). These two fatty acids have been shown to improve gait score and lameness in dogs with osteoarthritis. Omega-3 fatty acids have also been shown to have noticeable anti-inflammatory properties. It is for this reason, among other benefits, that they are routinely included at supplemental levels in senior dog diets. A good source of omega-3 fatty acids in dog foods include fish oils and other fish sources (especially salmon and herring) as well as flaxseed.\n\nOne of the most basic requirements of the aging dog’s body is the requirement for maintenance of their bones. In order for the bones to be able to heal from any injury or erosion, as well as maintain their strength to avoid these problem, they need a ready supply of calcium and phosphorus. Both of these are essential nutrients according to AAFCO guidelines, and should be included in a senior dog diet. Calcium and Phosphorus are also very valuable in the maintenance tooth health of dogs. In order for calcium to be properly absorbed into the body dogs will require another nutrient, vitamin D. adequate vitamin D is needed to form enough calcitriol, known as the active form of vitamin D. If enough is not present the body will begin to draw from stores of vitamin D within the body like the bones and teeth for its needs. This can lead to bone weakening and the inability to repair bone damage.\n\nBeet pulp is a common ingredient in dog diets as it is a very versatile and useful fiber source. Beet pulp provides fiber to the diet which acts as a stool hardener and aids in lower tract “cleansing”. The composition of beet pulp is such that it is an insoluble and moderately fermentable fiber. This means it can add bulk to the diet as well as moisture to the stool while also supplying the animal’s cells lining the intestine with energy due to the moderate fermentation that occurs.\n\nFlax seed is the whole seed of the flax plant which contains both soluble and insoluble fiber. The insoluble fraction includes cellulose, hemicellulose, and lignin. These components have a very good water binding capacity which aids in adding bulk into the diet of the dog. This has varying benefits for dogs depending on their lifestyle. In some dogs, it aids in digestion by preventing constipation, in others it acts to improve satiety and encourage weight loss. Flaxseed is also a good source of omega-3 and omega-6 fatty acids which have multiple health benefits for the animal such as improving coat quality. Flax seed is also one of the richest sources of alpha linoleic acid (ALA). ALA can be converted by the dog to DHA and EPA to carry out various functions in the body.\n\nFructooligosaccharides, commonly known as FOS, consist of many different types of indigestible oligosaccharides. FOS is shown to be beneficial in providing a source of energy for the good gut bacteria in dogs. Mannanoligosaccharides are also known as MOS which also have an effect on the overall gut health in dogs. These compounds both contain oligosaccharides however; they work in different manners. Constipation prevention and treatment can be carried out by the supplementation of FOS by its subsequent effect on gut bacteria. MOS works in a different manner by effecting the attachment of bad bacteria in the gut of the dog. These bad bacteria attach to the epithelial lining of the gastrointestinal tract and can cause the beginnings of pathogenic diseases. MOS works to counteract these by preventing the binding of these deleterious bacteria.\n\nA study carried out in dogs determined that these two compounds when supplemented together can help with overall immune function. This is due to the decrease in overall bad bacteria and an increase in good bacteria in the gastrointestinal tract. These two compounds also were not found to have any detrimental effects on food consumption, stool quality or stool output.\n\nA dogs brain undergoes many pathological changes during the aging process. Some of these changes can include damage to the DNA (deoxyribonucleic acid), a decrease in the amount of myelin overlay on nerve cells as well as a buildup of protein in the brain which can potentially have toxic effects. Due to these physiological changes senior and aging dog can have possible impairment of proper cognition. This impairment can include complex learning tasks as well as memory issues.\n\nThe addition of Vitamin E as an antioxidant in senior dog food can have a positive effect on brain and cognitive health. Vitamin E is a fat soluble vitamin which works to prevent oxidative damage from occurring. Reactive oxygen species can develop in the brain and can have a harmful effect by causing oxidative stress on the tissues if they are not subdued by antioxidants. Mitochondrial aerobic metabolism is thought to be the largest source of reactive oxidative species. As the mitochondria age their function declines which causes an increase in the production of oxidative species.\n\nStudies carried out in aging dogs looking at the effects of antioxidant supplemented diets have shown that older dogs supplemented with antioxidants including Vitamin E were able to correctly perform tasks more often than senior dogs whose diets were not supplemented. It has also been shown that in senior dogs consuming these antioxidant enriched diets there was an increase in positive behavioural actions during the feeding period compared to senior dogs consuming diets that were not supplemented.\n\nL-carnitine is an amino acid and precursor of acetyl-L-carnitine which is a mitochondrial cofactor. It acts to help with overall mitochondrial function as well as lipid metabolism which is an important function of mitochondria. This is important as an increase in mitochondrial function will help to reduce the rates of oxidative reactions in the brain which overall decrease damage to DNA and stimulates better cognitive function.\n\nSeveral physiological changes in the senior pet can lead to a decline in skin and coat health. Some of these changes include a loss of elasticity in the skin which leads to wrinkling, hair follicle atrophy which can cause hair loss, a decrease in oil secretion which can lead to dry and flaky skin as well as a loss of melanocytes which causes the loss of pigmentation of the hair follicles. Skin and coat health is one of most noticeable aging changes due to the fact that it results in a change in appearance of the senior dog. Skin and coat health are important to upkeep as dogs age and there are many components in senior dog foods that can benefit this important area of health.\n\nLinoleic acid is a polyunsaturated fatty acid that is classified as an omega 6-fatty acid. Linoleic acid plays an important role in the maintenance of the water barrier of skin. This helps prevent the dryness and scaly skin that occurs during the aging process. Omega 6-fatty acids can also have a slight anti-imflammatory role. Good sources of linoleic acid to look for in senior dog foods include corn oil, soybean oil and poultry fat.\n\nVitamin A is a fat soluble vitamin that aids in the keratinization process of hair. This process is important in maintaining a healthy coat in the aging dog and preventing the deterioration of epithelial tissues. Dogs do not directly need a source of Vitamin A as they can convert beta-carotene (a precursor to Vitamin A) into Vitamin A. However, Vitamin A supplementation in senior dog diets can assist senior dogs in maintaining their coats as their sebaceous activity and skin elasticity decrease. Vitamin A supplements can be included in senior dogs diets however there are also other good sources of Vitamin A. These include milk, egg yolk, and liver. The inactive form of Vitamin A, beta-carotene can be found in high amounts in carrots.\n\n Vitamin E is a key component found in dog foods for the skin to maintain elasticity and to replace old skin cells. Due to the anti-oxidant mechanisms of vitamin E it can prevent the formation of free radicals and in turn may prevent cancer cells from proliferating in senior dogs. Vitamin E is found in both plant and animal products such as vegetable oil, dark red vegetables and liver.\n\nZinc is among one of many trace minerals recommended for dogs of all ages. Dogs experience loss of elasticity and dryness of the skin as they age. The addition of zinc in the diet aids in the development of collagen and wound healing, and also will prevent the skin from becoming dry and flaky. Senior dogs can obtain zinc in their diet through the addition of various ingredients, including; red meats, whole grains, poultry by-product meals, and fish meals.\n\nLoss of hair pigmentation is a common concern for senior dogs. Copper has been shown to improve coat conditions by reducing dry skin and improving the overall pigmentation of the coat. Therefore, copper may able to delay the natural aging process of the whitening of a dog's coat.\n\nSenior dogs require a larger amount of riboflavin for maintenance compared to adult dogs. Vitamin B2, also known as riboflavin, plays an important role as a cofactor for the metabolism of carbohydrates. Riboflavin is required in the diet to prevent cracking and dry skin, as well as a darkening of the pigmentation of skin. Riboflavin is also important for the vision of the senior dog as deficiencies can cause alterations in blood supply to the cornea which may lead to impaired vision and potential blindness. A source of riboflavin in senior dog diets is important to help prevent changes that aging can cause on skin.\n\nImmune functions start to decline due to compromised ability to efficiently produce various proteins and cells that are important for the body's defense system as dogs age. Free radicals can cause oxidative stress, killing the cells or impairing the functional capability of the cells, which leads to weakening of the immune system. Therefore, providing dietary antioxidants can be an effective method to prevent the oxidative stress and support the immune system.\n\nOmega-6 and omega-3 fatty acids are very important for a strong healthy immune system and for preventing chronic disease in dogs. It is crucial in pet diets that the ratio of omega-6 to omega-3 fatty acids is properly balanced in order to achieve optimal health.\n\nIt is recommended to have a ratio of 5:1 to 10:1, with there being more omega-6 fatty acids than omega-3's. AAFCO has a maximum ratio listed of 30:1. For ideal health and decreased risk of low-grade chronic inflammation, it is more beneficial to have a lower ratio versus a higher one. Omega-3 fatty acids have anti-inflammatory properties and therefore need to be supplemented in a closer ratio to omega-6's which are more inflammatory. Out of all of the omega-3 fatty acids that could be used, the most potent are found in fish oil in the forms of EPA and DHA, these have the highest immunomodulatory activities. Omega-3 fatty acids tend to increase antioxidant requirements because they oxidize so rapidly, therefore when they are in a closer ratio to omega-6 fatty acids, as recommended, antioxidants must also be supplemented in the diet.\n\nVitamin E is an antioxidant that can be supplemented in the diet in order to strengthen the effect of fatty acid supplementations. This vitamin works to decrease the production of pro-inflammatory markers that are found in synovial fluid of the joints. With the help of this antioxidant, chronic inflammation can be avoided which aids senior dogs in maintaining a healthier immune system as well as helping to ease the symptoms of osteoarthritis. Also, formation of , which is a reactive oxygen species that suppress lymphocyte proliferation, can be decreased by vitamin E.\n\nBeta-carotene can be found in certain vegetables and it is a highly potent antioxidants. The number of T-cells is naturally decreased with age, leading to compromised immune function. However, in old dogs supplemented with dietary beta-carotene had no statistical difference in the amount of CD4+ T cells when compared to younger dogs. It can also enhance cell-mediated immune responses and help prevent cancer. Dogs supplemented with high dose of dietary beta-carotene may show red discolouration of feces and staining of hair. However, toxicity level of beta-carotene in dogs is not clearly understood as dogs can also cleave beta-carotene into vitamin A in their intestines.\n\nSince the gastrointestinal tract is exposed to foreign materials from ingested food, a healthy microbiota in gut is very important component of the immune system. Prebiotic and probiotic supplements can help maintain healthy gut flora. Examples of common prebiotic ingredients in dog foods are Fructooligosaccharides(FOS), Mannanoligosaccharides (MOS), and beta-glucan. Examples of common probiotic ingredients in dog foods are \"Lactobacillus acidophilus\" and \"Enterococcus faecium\".\n"}

The worship of Shiva and Shakti has been going on since times immemorial. History states that, during the era of Hindu kings, the governance of Jaunpur was in the hands of Ahir rulers. Heerchand Yadav is considered the first Aheer ruler of Jaunpur. The descendants of this clan used to surname 'Ahir'. These people built forts at Chandvak and Gopalpur. It is believed that the temple of Chaukiya Devi was built in the glory of their clan-deity either by the Yadavs or the Bhars- but in view of the predilections of the Bhars, it seems more logical to conclude that this temple was built by the Bhars. The Bhars were non-Aryans. The worship of Shiv and Shakti was prevalent in the non-Armyans. The Bhars held power in Jaunpur. At first, the Devi must have been installed on a praised platform or 'chaukiya' and probably because of this she was referred to as Chaukia Devi. Devu Sheetla is the representative blissful aspect of the Divine Mother: hence she was called Sheetla. On Mondays and Fridays, worshippers come here in quite large numbers. Huge crowds gather here during the Navratris.\n\nOne story says Goddess Durga has incarnated as little Katyayani, the daughter of sage Katyayan to destroy all arrogant evil demonic forces of the world, in her real form as Durga, she killed many demons that were sent by Kaalkeya.\n\nA demon named Jvarasura, the demon of fever, started spreading incurable diseases to Katyayani's childhood friends, such as cholera, dysentery, measles, smallpox etc. Katyayani cured the diseases of some of her friends. To relieve the world from all fevers and diseases, Katyayani assumed the form of Shitala Devi. Each of her four hands held a short broom, winnowing fan, jar of cooling water and a drinking cup. With her power, she cured all the children's diseases. Katyayani then requests her friend, Batuk to go out and confront the demon Jwarasur. A battle ensued between the young Batuk and demon Jwarasur. Jwarasur succeeds in defeating Batuk. Then, Batuk, lying dead, magically faded into dust. Jwarasur was shocked that Batuk disappeared and wondered where he went. Then, what he doesn't know that Batuk has assumed the form of an awful male figure. This person was three-eyed and had four arms. He held a battle-axe, sword, trident and demon head. He was pitch-black in color. His hair was flowing. Eyes blazed with fury. This figure wore a tiger-skin and a garland of skulls. Batuk assumed the form of Lord Shiva's ferocious form, the terrible Bhairav. Bhairav reprimands Jwarasur and tells him that he is the servant of Goddess Durga (incarnate as Katyayani). A long discussion ensued but then converted into battle. Jwarasur created many demons from his powers but Bhairav managed to destroy all of them. Finally, Bhairav wrestled with Jwarasur and killed him with his trident.\n\nThis Temple situated Near Jaunpur- Kerakat State Highway-36 and 3 km From Jaunpur City.\n"}

{"id": "15931586", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=15931586", "title": "Trim and Fit", "text": "Trim and Fit\n\nThe Trim and Fit (TAF) programme was a weight loss programme that targeted child obesity in Singapore schools between 1992 and 2007. Introduced by the Ministry of Education, schoolchildren under the programme were educated on nutrition, calorie control, and participated in intense physical exercise and activities.\n\nOverall, the programme was successful in reducing the obesity rate amongst schoolchildren from 14% to 9.8% by 2002. However, it came at a psychological cost of participants being stigmatised and in some cases, reportedly diagnosed with eating disorders. The TAF programme has since been replaced by the Holistic Health Framework (HHF) which includes all schoolchildren.\n\nThe TAF programme was introduced into schools in 1992 as part of the National Healthy Lifestyle Campaign. It was a result of a 1991 review of the nation's health plan by a national committee. Students aged 9 to pre-tertiary education were required to undergo annual BMI measurements and National Physical Fitness Award test (a precursor fitness test similar to Individual Physical Proficiency Test for National Servicemen). The country's population at that time was showing an increase in obesity that became associated with health problems and loss of manpower for male conscripts in National Service, which caused many conscripts to be deemed unfit for deployment into combat service.\n\nThe programme was deemed by observers as an interventionist measure, requiring students who were deemed overweight to be subject to additional intense exercises or physical activities for at least one and a half hours per week. These activities were organised during recess or at times set aside before or after lessons at schools' discretion. They were also issued with \"calorie cash\" – food ration coupons from which no more than a certain number of calories may be purchased and consumed in a recess break. The amount of calorie cash was inversely proportional to the child's obesity rate. Children which exceeded the 160% of the ideal BMI were referred to the Health Promotion Board for follow-up action.\n\nA direct impact of the TAF programme was a reduction of the obesity rate of schoolchildren from 14% to 9.8% by 2002. Worldwide public health experts have evaluated the TAF model for possible replication around the world.\n\nA carrot-and-stick approach was adopted in putting pressure on schools to meet the targets of fitness and obesity set by the ministry. Cash incentives were awarded by the ministry to schools that exceeded fitness targets and created new strategies to maintain students' obesity levels. Schools that failed had to face \"consultation\" sessions with ministry officials. Schools were also ranked annually based on how well targets were met at national level. Schools were given a wide discretion in determining how TAF was to be implemented, which resulted in some schools going so far as to implement apartheid-like segregation – for instance, where children were grouped to sit at normal and overweight tables during recess.\n\nPsychological motivation and peer pressure was emphasised in implementation of the programme, which formed the bulk of criticism of the programme as being insensitive and heavy-handed. Several TAF participants reported experiences of stigmatization, teasing, physiological stress and lower self-esteem as they found themselves being singled out for being obese. It was also quickly pointed out that the name of the programme contained a negative connotation, as its reverse acronym was 'FAT'. Despite such criticism, education officials continually insisted that the programme was not out to stigmatise overweight children.\n\nIn 2005, a National University of Singapore study of 4,400 schoolgirls linked TAF to an increase in eating disorders. It found that girls were more likely to have poorer relationship with their parents and their female friends. The findings correlated to a Singapore General Hospital study released a week earlier which found that instances of anorexia nervosa and bulimia increased six-fold from 1994 to 2002. The Ministry of Education quickly rejected these findings; claiming TAF was not a factor in the increase in anorexia.\n\nTwo years later, in 2007, the Ministry of Education decided to replace TAF with the Holistic Health Framework (HHF). The HHF intended to ensure the fitness and health of all schoolchildren.\n\n"}
{"id": "1581831", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1581831", "title": "Vark", "text": "Vark\n\nVark, also called varak (also silver leaf, German paper), is super fine filigree foil sheet of pure metals, typically silver but sometimes gold, used to decorate South Asian sweets and food to make those look more appetising. The silver and gold are edible, though flavorless. Varak is made by pounding silver into sheets, a few micrometres (µm) thick, typically 0.2 µm-0.8 µm. The silver sheets are typically packed between layers of paper for support; this paper is peeled away before use. It is fragile and breaks into smaller pieces if handled with direct skin contact. Those leaves in the 0.2 µm thickness tend to adhere to skin if handled directly. Vark sheets are laid or rolled over some South Asian sweets, confectionery, dry fruits and spices. Due to the safety and ethical reasons, the government of India issued food safety and product standards guidelines for the manufacturers of the silver foil.\n\nVaraka means cloth, cloak or a thing that covers something else. Vark is sometimes spelled \"Varaq\", \"varq\", \"vark\", \"varkh\", \"varakh\", \"varkha\", or \"waraq\" (, ).\n\nThe tradition of using silver and gold foils to decorate food originated from the ancient Ayurvedic practice of using precious metals and pieces of pearl and conch shell in \"bhasma\" (medicinal ash). Varaka is mentioned in several ancient Sanskrit documents, particularly in Ayurvedic and medical literature. The word \"varaka\" is mentioned with \"swarna\" (gold), \"tara\" (silver) or \"rupera\" (silver) in these documents; the discussion is in three forms of these precious metals: \"patra\" (leaf), \"varaka\" (thin foil) and \"bhasma\" (ash). Ayurvedic documents consider silver as an antimicrobial astringent, while gold is claimed to be an aphrodisiac. This is not unique to Indian subcontinent; in Europe, edible gold (\"Aureum potabile\") and silver were also claimed to have medicinal properties; later studies found that they can indeed be antibacterial owing to the oligodynamic effect.\n\nVarak is made by placing the pure metal dust between parchment sheets, then pounding the sheets until the metal dust mold into a foil, usually a few micrometres (µm) thick, typically 0.2 µm-0.8 µm. The sheets are typically packed with paper for support; this paper is peeled away before use. it generally takes 2 hours to pound the silver particles into foils. It is fragile and breaks into smaller pieces if handled with direct skin contact. Those leaves in the 0.2 µm thickness tend to adhere to skin if handled directly. Vark sheets are laid or rolled over some South Asian sweets.\n\nParticles were traditionally manually pounded between the layers of ox gut or cow hide. It is easier to separate the silver leaf from the animal tissue than to separate it from the paper. Due to the concerns of vegetarians population of India, manufacturers have switched to the modern technologies. that have evolved for the production of silver leaves in India, Germany, Russia and China. Modern technologies include beating over sheets of black special treated paper or polyester sheets coated with food grade calcium powder (nicknamed \"german plastic\") are used instead of ox-guts or cow hide. Old City in Hydrabad use to be the hub of traditional manual manufacturing, where it is a dying trade. Modern machine based manufacturing hubs are based in Delhi and Noida.\n\nThe silver is edible, though flavorless. It is also commonly used in Pakistan and India as coating on sweets, dry fruits (such as almonds, cashews, and dates), and in sugar balls, betel nuts, cardamom, and other spices. Estimated consumption of Vark is 275 tons (according to BWC-Beauty without cruelty data) annually (c. 2016).\n\nEdible silver and gold foils on sweets, confectionery and desserts is not unique to the Indian subcontinent; other regions such as Japan and Europe have long used precious metal foils as food cover and also decoration, including specialty drinks such as Danziger Goldwasser.\n\nConcerns have been raised about the ethical acceptability and food safety of Vark, as not all of it is pure silver (sometimes aluminium is used, which is toxic), nor hygienically prepared, and the foil nowadays commonly is beaten between layers of ox-gut because it is easier to separate the silver leaf from animal tissue than to separate it from paper. Due to the grinding effect of the hammering the animal intestine become part of the silver foil, which is sold in bulk. Hindu and Jain religions are mostly vegetarian, this led to the decline in the usage of varq in sweets or suparis. Indian Airlines asked its caterers to not apply put varaq on the food supplied to ensure the animal intestine is left out of varaq. In 2016, Government of India banned the usage of animal guts or skins in the making of verk. Consequently, the Indian market for Vark has mostly converted to using the machine-based vegetarian process in the making of the silver foils. This directive was halted in 2017 as a result of job loss concerns. Food Safety and Standards Authority of India has issued guidelines for the silver leaf manufactures to adhere to regarding thickness, weight, purity, labeling and hygiene of the silver leaf.\n\nGold and silver are approved food foils in the European Union, as E175 and E174 additives respectively. The independent European food-safety certification agency, TÜV Rheinland, has deemed gold leaf safe for consumption. Gold and silver leaf are also certified as kosher. These inert precious metal foils are not considered toxic to human beings nor to broader ecosystems. Large quantities of ingested bioactive silver can cause argyria, but the use of edible silver or gold as \"vark\" is not considered harmful to the body, since the metal is in inert form (not ionic bioactive form), and the quantities involved in normal use are minuscule.\n\nOne study has found that about 10% of 178 foils studied from the Lucknow (India) market were made of aluminium. Of the tested foils, 46% of the samples were found to have the desired purity requirement of 99.9% silver, whereas the rest had less than 99.9% silver. All the tested Indian foils contained on average trace levels of nickel (487 ppm), lead (301 ppm), copper (324 ppm), chromium (83 ppm), cadmium (97 ppm) and manganese (43 ppm). All of these are lower than natural anthropogenic exposures of these metals; the authors suggest there is a need to address a lack of purity standards in European Union and Indian food additive grade silver. The total silver metal intake per kilogram of sweets eaten, from vark, is less than one milligram.\n\n"}

It includes the rights of women in the United States to adequate sexual health, available contraception methods, and treatment for sexually transmitted diseases. The prevalence of women’s health issues in American culture is inspired by second-wave feminism in the United States. As a result of this movement, women of the United States began to question the largely male-dominated health care system and demanded a right to information on issues regarding their physiology and anatomy. The U.S. government has made significant strides to propose solutions, like creating the Women’s Health Initiative through the Office of Research on Women’s Health in 1991.\n\nThe Department of Health and Human Services has developed a definition for sexual health in the United States based on the World Health Organization’s definition of sexual health. \n“Sexual health is a state of well-being in relation to sexuality across the life span that involves physical, emotional, mental, social and spiritual dimensions. Sexual health is an intrinsic element of human health and is based on positive, equitable, and respectful approach to sexuality, relationships, and reproduction, that is free of coercion, fear, discrimination, stigma, shame, and violence.\"\n\nThe United States government recognizes that gender is a factor which plays a significant role in sexual health.\n\nThe U.S. Department of Health and Human Services has identified national reproductive health goals including reducing the level of unintended pregnancy. Out of all the pregnancies reported in the United States, half are unplanned. Of the 62 million women in the U.S. who are able to have children, seven out of ten of these women are sexually active but do not want to become pregnant. Contraception is a major issue of women’s reproductive health. 86% of sexually active women practice some form of contraception and 30% of these women use a hormonal form of contraception. Women in the U.S. have more freedoms in deciding their use of contraceptives among other global nations, comparatively.\n\nThe Centers for Disease Control (CDC) have significant pull over the decision-making process women must make when choosing different types of contraception. Women of the U.S. still rely on their healthcare providers for the majority of information they receive about contraceptive use. In order to help healthcare providers provide appropriate family planning care, the CDC published the US Medical Elibility Criteria for Contraceptive Use,2010. The CDC lists methods of birth control under two categories: reversible and permanent.\n\n\n\nHormonal contraception is the most popular method of contraception among women in the United States. Women under the age of thirty more commonly use hormonal oral contraception as their preferred method. Hormonal contraceptives can be almost 100% effective when used perfectly, but in most cases it is used imperfectly. Oral hormonal contraceptives have an 8% failure rate. The popularity of oral hormonal contraceptives among women changes over the course of a year with 32% of women deciding to discontinue use of an oral hormonal contraceptive after one year of typical use.\n\nA large stigma exists among women on the topic of using an intrauterine device (IUD) as a form of contraception. The two types of IUDs that exist for current contraceptive use are Copper T 380A and levonorgestrel-releasing intrauterine system or Mirena. IUDs are underutilized by women in the United States with only 2% of women using IUD as an effective contraception. The effectiveness of a contraceptive is described in terms of perfect use and typical use. An IUD is different than most forms of contraception, as it is 100% effective in both cases of use. It is not possible to use IUDs improperly or inconsistently because they must be inserted inside of the uterus. Women in the United States have many fears about the use of IUDs, making them the less popular form of contraception. For many women in the U.S., IUDs are only an option when other traditional contraception methods have been used (hormonal birth control, barrier methods, etc.) or when a women has already had children. The fear surrounding use of an IUD stems from a lack of proper education on all available contraception options available to women in the U.S.. Women have cited being afraid of the quality of the device itself, placing the device inside their bodies voluntarily, and the time required to hold the device in place. There is a lack of knowledge about female anatomy and pregnancy prevention, even among women of the United States.\n\nA health objective of the United States government through The United States Public Health Service is to reduce the number of cases of sexually transmitted diseases from the 1980s to today. The Centers for Disease Control is responsible for many studies on the topic of STDs as well as the effect of STDs on women and girls. STDs are defined by the CDC as “infections you can get from having sex with someone who has an infection”. There are more than twenty types of identifiable STDs caused by bacteria, parasites, or viruses. Within one year in the United States there are an estimated 12 million cases of sexually transmitted diseases that occur. Of those 12 million cases there are 1.5 million cases of gonorrhea, 500,000 cases of genital herpes, and 110,000 cases of syphilis. Both women and men in the United States are affected by the STD epidemic. However, women have a stronger negative health reaction to some STDs than men. The negative health effects of STDs for women can include pelvic inflammatory disease (PIV), ectopic pregnancy, chronic pelvic pain, infertility, fetal and perinatal infections, complications to pregnancy, fetal loss, cervical cancer, and increased risk of tubal pregnancy, intrauterine growth retardation and preterm delivery. Women in the U.S. are less likely to seek out treatment for STDs for a variety of reasons. Some STDs appear asymptomatic in women therefore women are less likely to seek out treatment for STDs than men. Like most health topics, there is a gap that exists in understanding the pathology of diseases in women versus men. Women receive less than adequate information about the prevalence of STDs as well as the symptoms of STDs.\n\nAs with contraception in the U.S., a stigma exists which prevents women from learning about all possible STDs and their treatment. A study by the Journal of Women’s Health identified STDs as a topic women would rather not talk about. Women, with their partners, do not commonly discuss STDs as well. The stigma surrounding STDs in the U.S. prevents women from discussing the topic even among healthcare provides, close friends, partners, and family. Younger women do not understand the risk that STDs can pose to them. For example, Chlamydia is one of the most common STDs affecting women and men in the United States. Women do not follow the recommendation that people should be screened for Chlamydia at least once per year. Most women do not even know any information about Chlamydia as an STD besides the fact that it is curable.\n\nSTD screening is most effective for identifying STDs in women, but is commonly underutilized by women in the U.S. Healthcare access and access to family planning clinics increases the probability that women will seek out and utilize STD screening. Screening is a form of testing healthy versus symptomatic people against traditional symptoms of STDs to determine STD prevalence. The Planned Parenthood Federation of America has available clinics across the United States for the purpose of screening for STDs as well as other family planning services. Planned Parenthood suggests that sexually active women screen for STDs at least annually. A study by the Journal for Women’s Health identified a need for a knowledge campaign on STD screening targeting sexually active young women.\n"}
