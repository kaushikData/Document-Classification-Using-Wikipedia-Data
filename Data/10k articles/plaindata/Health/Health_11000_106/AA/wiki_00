In July 1981 about 308 people died in Bangalore by illicit liquor. Adulteration of cheap liquor by methyl alcohol resulted in deaths.\n\nAvailability of cheap spurious alcohol, (known as hooch) is a problem around the Tannery Road area of the Bangalore Cantonment, with many dwellers getting addicted. Notorious bootlegger Marimuthu (who later became a councillor of BBMP) and Ameer Jan were running the racket. Hootch is brewed from industrial alcohol, by separating Methyl Alcohol, and adding water - A dangerous process which can leave traces of poisonous Methyl Alcohol. The brew is slow poison, damaging kidney and intestines, leading to slow death. On 7 July 1981, about 300 people (Official figures 229) around the Tannery Road area died as a result of consuming this spurious alcohol. Most of the victims were poor Dalits. Police registered cases against 63 people, but none were convicted or punished. An enquiry commission revealed a connection between some politicians and the bootleggers. A paltry sum of INR 1000 per family was paid to the victims by the Gundu Rao government.\n"}

{"id": "4586751", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=4586751", "title": "Body composition", "text": "Body composition\n\nIn physical fitness, body composition is used to describe the percentages of fat, bone, water and muscle in human bodies. Because muscular tissue takes up less space in our body than fat tissue, our body composition, as well as our weight, determines leanness. Two people of the same sex and body weight may look completely different because they have a different body composition.\n\nThe most accurate estimation of body composition is derived from body density by means of the equation of fractional densities which states that the overall density of a mixture containing more than one substance (each with a different density) can be calculated if the proportion and density of each component substance is known. For determination of body composition the body is often assumed to be composed of four basic substances (\"four compartment model\") with the general form of the equation as follows:\n\nWhere: formula_2 = overall body density, formula_3 = proportion of water, formula_4 = proportion of fat, formula_5 = proportion of protein, formula_6 = proportion of mineral, formula_7 = density of water, formula_8 = density of fat, formula_9 = density of protein, formula_10 = density of mineral\n\nIn a research laboratory setting, the overall density of the body (Db) is calculated from its mass and volume (Db = mass/volume). The mass of the body is found by simply weighing a person on a scale. The volume of the body is most easily and accurately determined by completely immersing a person in water and calculating the volume of water from the weight of water that is displaced (via \"underwater weighing\"). The proportions of water, protein and mineral in the body are found by various chemical and radiometric tests. The densities of water, fat, protein and mineral are either measured or estimated. The equation is then rearranged to solve for the proportion of fat (f) from the other quantities.\n\nA reasonably accurate estimation of body fat can be obtained by means of a \"two compartment model\" of the human body which is based upon two simplifying assumptions: 1. Human fat has a density of 0.9 grams/ml, and 2. The lean (non-fat) components of the human body have an overall density of 1.1 grams/ml.\n\nThe two compartment model allows for an estimation of the proportions of fat and lean components of the body to be made from the overall body density. And, as explained above, the overall body density (Db) is easily calculated from body mass and body volume. Rearranging the equation of fractional densities to solve for the proportion of fat (f) will yield the following equation:\n\nThe density of human fat is remarkably constant across all sub-groups studied but variations have been reported in the density of the fat free mass (i.e. lean or non-fat components). To address these differences, unique equations for the two compartment model have been proposed for specific populations.\n\nBody composition measurement with dual energy X-ray absorptiometry (DEXA) is used increasingly for a variety of clinical and research applications. A DEXA scan requires medical supervision by a radiologist and some consider it to be the new \"Gold Standard\" in body composition testing. Total body scans using DEXA give accurate and precise measurements of body composition, including bone mineral content (BMC), bone mineral density (BMD), lean tissue mass, fat tissue mass, and fractional contribution of fat.\n\nThe estimation of body fatness from body density (by means of underwater weighing) was accepted as the \"gold standard\" for many decades. Some researchers now claim that whole body scanning techniques (e.g. \"DEXA\") are the new \"gold standard\". But these claims are somewhat dubious since the scanning algorithms are validated against body composition assessments based on fractional density from underwater weighing.\n\nDEXA measurements are highly reproducible if the same type of machine is used (citation needed), making them excellent for monitoring pharmaceutical therapy, nutritional or exercise intervention, sports training and or other body composition altering programs. They are also fast, simple, non-invasive, and expose the subject to a level of x-rays less than that of a cross-country flight. DEXA exams provide both total body and up to 14 regional (trunk, individual arms & legs, android, gynoid, etc.) results. However, the role of DEXA in clinical evaluations and research studies has been questioned by Wang et al. who stated that \"the errors of the DXA [DEXA] method are still of concern if it were to be used as the criterion.\"\n\nAnother technique for measuring body composition has been developed for measuring body volume using a different method than underwater weighing. The technique uses air as opposed to water and is known as air displacement plethysmography (ADP). Subjects enter a sealed chamber that measures their body volume through the displacement of air in the chamber. Body volume is combined with body weight (mass) in order to determine body density. The technique then estimates the percentage of body fat and lean body mass (LBM) through empirically derived equations similar to those used with underwater weighing (for the density of fat and fat free mass).\n\nAnother method is bioelectrical impedance analysis (BIA), which uses the resistance of electrical flow through the body to estimate body fat. Unfortunately, BIA is highly sensitive to hydration status and water intake. Drinking water dilutes the electrolytes in the body making it less conductive as does increasing body fat.\n\nThe Body Volume Indicator (BVI) is a technique used for measuring body shape. Initially, BVI technology employed white light scanning machines to measure an individuals body shape. However, recent technological advances in 3D measurement have enabled BVI to be calculated using images taken on a smartphone. Two images are required to create an individual 3D silhouette. By comparing this 3D silhouette with MRI data, body volume and fat distribution can be calculated (BVI website).\n\nBody composition can also be measured using the skin fold test, which is performed using a tool called a caliper. It can be done in nine steps: \n\nA common skin fold method is by using gun style calipers to measure the thickness of subcutaneous fat in multiple places on the body. This includes the abdominal area, the subscapular region, arms, buttocks and thighs. These measurements are then used to estimate total body fat.\n\nUltrasound has also been used to measure subcutaneous fat thickness, and by using multiple points an estimation of body composition can be made. Ultrasound has the advantage of being able to also directly measure muscle thickness and quantify intramuscular fat.\n\nAssessment of somatic (skeletal) protein is typically determined by simple measurements and calculations including mid arm circumference (MAC), mid arm muscle circumference (MAMC), and creatinine height ratio (CHI). Creatinine height ratio is calculated as 24-hour urine creatinine multiplied by 100 over the expected 24-hour urine creatinine for height. This calculation results in a percentage which can indicate protein depletion.\n\nThe methods above are each valid and notable in providing a reasonably accurate range of the \"true body composition\" of the tested individual. However, each method does possess its own individual limitations, indeed precluding to the existence of so many variable methods available for an individual to use. Therefore, the actual method of testing body composition is not as important as the consistency of measurement in between each test. (See internal consistency for merits on testing in this manner.) If an individual is to be tested from one period to the next, all factors should ideally remain as similar as possible to reflect the best indicator of true change in composition.\n\nThe exercises needed to maintain optimal body composition differ from man to woman to child, but the ideal types of fitness remain the same.\n\nThe primary exercises needed to improve body composition involve fat burning and cardiovascular exercises.\n\n"}

The effort lasted from 1982 to the 1990s, and generally coincides with James P. Grant's tenure as executive director of UNICEF (1980–1995). The child survival revolution included various programs and conferences, including the World Summit for Children in 1990.\n\nRather than treating child mortality as a measurement of development, the effort sought to directly reduce child mortality as a way toward development.\n\nAlthough the revolution was started by UNICEF, other organizations, including the Rockefeller Foundation, UNDP, the World Bank, and WHO joined; thus the revolution is sometimes called \"a grand alliance for children\". The revolution was analogized with the Green Revolution by James Grant.\n\nThe initial reaction to Grant's announcement of the child survival revolution was overwhelmingly negative due to several reasons, including practical reasons, e.g., the money and infrastructure to support Grant's plans not existing.\n\nIt is estimated that the child vaccination increased worldwide from 20% in 1982(?) to 80% in 1990 because of the child survival revolution.\n\nWriting in 1990, D. A. Henderson noted that although \"dramatic progress\" had been made because of the child survival revolution, the results were still \"little-appreciated\".\n\nThe child survival revolution is estimated to have saved the lives of 25 million children.\n\nThe genesis of the Child Survival Revolution can be traced to 1973 when James P. Grant, gave his annual lecture at Johns Hopkins University's School of Public Health. In reviewing research findings of Prof Carl E. Taylor Grant grasped how the collective package from Taylor's Narangwal research (childhood pneumonia, oral rehydration therapy, neonatal tetanus, family planning) served as a parallel to The Green Revolution, saying \"we can now start to talk about a Child Survival Revolution!\" Grant had earlier been Deputy Director of USAID, and in that role had been an early and strong backer of The Green Revolution, a global effort that dramatically raised global food supply through a package of agricultural innovations (new seed types, fertilizer, irrigation, pesticides, and mechanization). Grant grasped that it was the synergy that came through a package of interventions that would allow children to survive,\n\nFor much of the child survival revolution, James Grant and UNICEF adopted a strategy known as GOBI-FFF, a form of selective primary healthcare:\n\nOf these, \"immunization and ORT were seen as the 'twin-engines' of the child survival revolution\".\n\nAfter 1986, when studies by Alfred Sommer and others were published, vitamin A administration also became a focus.\n\nAlthough the revolution was started by UNICEF, other organizations were involved.\n\n\nUNICEF took advantage of the growing levels of basic education and access to television and radio to generate support for the child survival revolution through persuasion.\n\nJames Grant also \"persuaded many heads of state to get personally involved in their national programmes for children, for example in their immunization by being photographed giving polio drops to a baby\". Several figures from film and sports, like Audrey Hepburn, Liv Ullmann, and Peter Ustinov also participated in the UNICEF Goodwill Ambassador program.\n\n"}

The field of community practice social work encompasses community organizing, social planning, human service management, community development, policy analysis, policy advocacy, evaluation, mediation, electronic advocacy and other larger systems interventions.\n\nIn the UK the term is often used for community work or Health visitors.\n\nAlthough community practice has overlap with many other applied social science disciplines, such as urban planning, economic development, public affairs, rural sociology and nonprofit management, its roots go back as far as the 1890s. Community Practice social workers typically have a Masters in Social Work (MSW). There are several MSW programs in the United States that offer Community Practice Concentrations, while many other MSW programs offer specializations in one or several types of community practice, such as social services administration or policy analysis. The professional group of community practitioners in the USA is the Association for Community Organization and Social Administration (ACOSA), which publishes the leading journal in the field, The Journal of Community Practice.\n\nDue to community work's applied nature, theory is not always considered necessary or even utilized. Despite this, there are number of theoretical models of community practice that guide the practitioner toward social action. These theoretical models have evolved from proto-models utilized in the Progressive Era to the present day.\nSynthesized from the work of Jane Addams, Bessie McClanehan, Robert P. Lane, Murray Ross, Jack Rothman, Sam Taylor, and Robert Roberts, community workers Marie Weil and Dorothy Gamble have crafted eight theoretical models of community practice as:\n\nIn any of these models, the theoretical outcomes, or goals, are as follows:\n\nHistorically, social work practice has been divided between two different categories: micro practice and macro practice. Although there is often an overlap in skills between the two areas, micro-practitioners generally focus on working with individuals whereas macro-practitioners generally work on creating change in larger social, political or community systems. Macro-social work professions that typically engage in community practice methods include: community organizers, political organizers, fundraisers, program managers, and community educators.\n\nIt should also be noted that a third social work practice category is sometimes referenced called 'mezzo practice'. Mezzo practice can be defined by its combination of micro and macro aspects with the focus of interventions being smaller groups or systems. Whereas macro practice often focuses on policy or systematic changes, some researchers and practitioners consider mezzo practice to focus more on change at the community or neighborhood level. Because there is often an overlap between macro and mezzo, some argue mezzo practice to be a sub-category within macro social work. Although it makes up a smaller portion of social work practice, mezzo practice represents an effective way to bridge some of the perceived distances between micro and macro practice methods.\n\nTraditionally social work practice is located within office or agency settings. However, community practice may also utilize alternative spaces. Emerging from the tradition of settlement houses of the nineteenth century, the use of existing spaces for services provided by social work and community organizing truly makes the services community based. Nontraditional settings are public spaces, often part of the service industry where community members gather socially. These spaces must be rooted in the cultural heritage of the community. The spaces should also be unique to the community and already heavily utilized for gathering. The primary role of nontraditional spaces is not to provide social work services, though they can be utilized for such services. These spaces are venues for outreach, where social work services use existing gathering spaces to bring services to the community to provide additional resources to more individuals.\n\nThe goal of using existing gathering spaces as a venue for social work is to build on the existing structures of a community. Communities offer numerous characteristics that can be built upon for services and organizing. Furthermore, by organizing around an existing collective identity or shared experience there is a building block for group cohesion and may increase effectiveness of organizing. Effectively navigating entry into these spaces may take time and diligence on behalf of the organizer. Once in these spaces, it is important to honor and build upon existing leadership.\n\nNontraditional settings provide cultural access as well as access to multiple generations. These spaces are often seen as a bridge point where multiple generations gather and where cultural values and traditions are learned or passed on. In many instances these spaces are inclusive of non-English speaking members of the community.\n\nMacro-social workers and those engaging in community practice methods may encounter a number of limitations that will make their work in the community more challenging.\n\nSince macro-community practice is an ongoing and relatively time intensive process, the consequences can be felt throughout the community and by the organizer(s) when projects or efforts are perceived to fail. The community may reject or distrust the individuals or organizations involved with leading the organizing efforts, creating obstacles for future involvement in the community. Likewise, community organizers and organizations may burnout due to distress and chronic exposure to clients just as in micro-social work. However, macro-social workers may specifically burnout on community practice due to unsuccessful efforts or unique constraints of the community, shifting them from macro to micro based work.\n\nCurrently, social workers engaging in community practice work comprise a minority within the larger social work profession. As of 2010, less than 20% of students in Master of Social Work programs in the United States have a macro-practice related concentration. Those concentrations include: community organizing, community planning, social policy and program evaluation. This compares to 56% of students who concentrate in direct practice and clinical social work. Because macro-social work is pursued less within the field, macro-social workers can feel under-prepared by their education, unrepresented, and not supported.\n\nHere is a breakdown of US Master of Social Work student's concentration areas as of 2010.\n\n\n"}

For sexually transmitted diseases, this is generally limited to sexual partners and can fall under the heading of partner services. But, for highly virulent diseases such as Ebola and tuberculosis, a thorough contact tracing would require information regarding casual contacts.\n\nSome AIDS activists have argued that contact tracing is counter-productive in that it would lead people to avoid HIV testing for fear that it would breach their right to privacy.\n\nBy tracing the sexual partners of infected individuals, testing them for infection, treating the infected and tracing their contacts in turn, STI clinics could be very effective at suppressing infections in the general population.\n\nIn the 1980s, first genital herpes and then AIDS emerged into the public consciousness as sexually transmitted diseases that could not be cured by modern medicine. AIDS in particular has a long asymptomatic period—during which time HIV (the human immunodeficiency virus, which causes AIDS) can replicate and the disease can be transmitted to others—followed by a symptomatic period, which leads rapidly to death unless treated. HIV/AIDS entered the United States in about 1969 likely through a single infected immigrant from Haiti. Recognition that AIDS threatened a global pandemic led to public information campaigns and the development of treatments that allow AIDS to be managed by suppressing the replication of HIV for as long as possible. Contact tracing continues to be an important measure, even when diseases are incurable, as it helps to contain infection.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "9084874", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=9084874", "title": "Female urinal", "text": "Female urinal\n\nA female urinal is designed for the anatomy of women and intended to be used by women and girls. Different models enable urination in standing, semi-squatting, or squatting postures, always without direct bodily contact with the urinal. \n\nUnisex urinals are distributed by various companies and can be used by females and males alike. Female urinals and unisex urinals are much less common than male urinals. Urinals are more abundant in men's and boys' public toilets than in the facilities in private homes.\n\nIn the 1970s, Alexander Kira, professor of architecture and sanitary engineering at Cornell University, conducted studies on urination behaviour of both genders. He pursued the goal of developing sanitary fixtures that are adapted to the human body and its needs, breaking with conventional design specifications.\nOn a conventional toilet bowl, the \"correct\" use is determined by the shape of the sanitary fixture. Amongst other things, Kira investigated the body positions that males and females prefer to use when no external guidelines are given, for example while urinating in nature. He examined the trajectories of the urine stream and its controllability, as well as comfort and health aspects of different body positions. While males usually urinate in a standing posture and direct the stream forward by hand, females prefer to take a squatting position. The stream is controlled by the posture of the entire body and is directed vertically downwards to slightly oblique backwards. This position is generally the most comfortable for females and is associated with the lowest spray dispersion.\n\nThe female urinal models offered today are conceptually similar to each other and follow the shape and design of male urinals but are more closely tailored to the female anatomy. One difference is that the female stands with her back toward the urinal and adopts a half-squatting position, which is also sometimes called the \"skier's posture\" or \"hovering stance\". This is based on the posture that females generally adopt in conventional public toilets if they are dirty or physical contact is not desired.\n\nIn countries where squat toilets are the norm, female urinals can also be found as a ceramic pan at floor level. This kind of urinal would be used in a full squat position to avoid splashing back of urine. In the past, models that were used in a full squat (similar to Asian squat-style toilets) have been developed to the prototype stage or brought to the market, like the \"Peeandgo\" by \"Chen-Karlsson\", but those could not establish themselves.\nAt present, all female urinals available on the western market are wall-mounted and used in a half-squat, \"skiing\" position.\n\nUrinals for female users could potentially have some of the same advantages as urinals for male users compared to toilets (with regards to urination):\n\nApproximately 90% of public toilet use is exclusively for urination (as compared to defecation). Due to the increased number of units in the same amount of floor space, there is a faster process with shorter queue in front of public toilets. By installing urinals, up to 30% more people can use the toilet facilities at the same time.\n\nFemale urinals could be possibly suitable for use in public toilets which are highly frequented during peak hours and which are likely to attract large numbers of visitors, especially places like schools, universities, discotheques, shopping centers, and bus stations. In addition, mobile female urinals have been developed for use at open-air events, festivals, as well as free-standing units for public spaces.\n\nA study conducted in Australia in 2011 showed that more than half of the women interviewed would use a urinal if it were available. In the meantime, demand is increasingly being made for \"urination equality\" (potty parity)  – equal rights for men and women. A grassroots urination equality campaign in the Netherlands caused a sensation in 2017, with women using urinals in men's toilets.\n\nRecent developments in creating urinals for females and for use by both sexes are not a revolution in sanitation, as some manufacturers suggest. Rather, it is the renaissance of a concept whose roots lie in the 19th century. At that time, during the early days of public toilet development, female urinals were already being installed and urinals were not thought of as being exclusively for males. For example, the 1897 German \"Handbuch der Architektur\" (handbook of architecture) shows \"women's urinals with automatic rinsing\", although at that time the advantages were also seen in the less costly installation and water savings: \n\nAt that time, the female urinal was unable to establish itself in Germany, as they were installed only occasionally. In 1902, on the initiative of the City Building Office, a decision was taken in Munich to install women's urinals throughout the city in public convenience stores. A letter to the Kirchmair Board of Directors, for example, explains the plenary decision of the Baumagistrat on 13 February 1902:\n\nThis idea was pursued further, so that the documents of January 13, 1906 contained plans for concrete implementation:\n\nIn the architectural guide \"München und seine Bauten\" (Munich and its buildings) from 1912, the women's urinals in three public toilets (Lerchenfeldstraße, Ottostraße and Max-Weber-Platz) were mentioned in the chapter on \"Nursing homes\". In contrast to the actual toilets, these were intended as \"freehold toilets\", i.e. for free use. They enjoyed great popularity and were highly frequented. In the course of the 1910s, there was no further expansion, probably because the free use did not generate profits to the city's treasury funds. Finally, the \"Freiaborte\" (free public lavatories) for women were converted into institutions with costs. A later proposal by the first female city councillor of Munich in 1922 for the reintroduction of those free urinals were already fended off in the first place by the purely male directorate of the \"Bade- und Bedürfnisanstalten\" establishments.\n\nThe development at the turn of the century was not followed up in Germany and these first approaches were increasingly forgotten.\n\nUntil the 1970s, few female urinals were available in the US from different manufacturers, such as the Sanistand of American Standard Companies. In the 1980s and 1990s, various concepts and prototypes were developed, although most of them were not developed beyond the design stage. Female urinals have only been used again since the turn of the millennium and are marketed commercially, primarily in Europe.\n\nFrom 1950 to 1974, the American Standard company offered the mass-produced \"Ladies' Home Urinal\". It did not provide significant advantages over conventional toilets, because it used just as much floor space and water for flushing. Its main selling point was that it was specifically designed for women to use without touching.\n\nSeveral other designs have been tried since then, but they required the user either to hover awkwardly or to bring her genitals into close contact with the fixture. Most have not caught on. Current clothes fashions, such as panty hose and slacks, inhibit females from using them because they do not want their garments to touch the urinal or the floor. Often, females have little experience with urinals and do not know whether to approach them forward or backward.\n\nStandard trough models intended for use with a specialized funnel have been introduced with some success, at outdoor festivals such as Glastonbury, to reduce dwell times and to alleviate long queues. In 2011, a portable female urinal—the Pollee—was introduced at the Roskilde Festival in Denmark and was received enthusiastically by female festival visitors.\n\nUrinals are being developed that can be used by all sexes (males, females and third sexes). While urinals for men and boys can be found almost everywhere in public toilets, unisex and female urinals are still niche products. Many people feel that this should be left alone because of obvious biological differences that make the use of urinals far more convenient for the male population than they would be for the female population. According to Mete Demiriz, professor of sanitary technology at the \"Westphalian University of Applied Sciences\" in Gelsenkirchen, economic considerations and social conventions also prevent the wider installation of female urinals: \n\nA study in 1999 surveyed 600 women to discover how interested they were in having female urinals which would be used in a standing position. The majority of respondents indicated a desire to have such facilities.\n\nIn the 1990s, a number of prototypes were developed for female urinals, of which only three were finally ready for the market and are now used: the \"Lady P\" by \"Sphinx Sanitair\", the \"Lady Loo\" by \"GBH\" and the \"Girly\" by \"Ceramica Catalano\", which has won several design awards. Since the 2000s, female urinals have been introduced in a few European public toilets.\n\nIn the course of the development towards unisex toilets, designers and developers are increasingly faced with the challenge of creating gender-appropriate solutions. Models have now been developed that can be used comfortably by females and males alike.\n\nIn the future, Berlin will have unisex toilets and unisex urinals, to be used by both sexes. With the expiration of the operation contract for public toilets with Wall GmbH in Berlin, a new toilet concept for public spaces in Berlin is being developed. Urinals that can be used by both sexes are an essential part of the future unisex toilet facilities. \nThe world's first mobile urinal for women was presented at the Roskilde Festival 2011 under the name of Pollee and proved to be a great success. The Pollee-Urinal is primarily intended for open-air events, especially music festivals and is distributed as a women's urinal, but can also be used as a unisex urinal in principle.\n\nAt present, two different arrangements are currently being implemented in practice: in a row arrangement (usually with a screen as a separating element), comparable to male urinals, and in cabins or booths, as in classic toilets. The main advantage compared to the classic toilet, the compact space requirements, is lost. With a row arrangement, the number of facilities increases noticeably and thus a faster use becomes possible. However, this is not the case with the booth arrangement, in which a classic toilet bowl is simply replaced by a urinal. The booth solution is often put forward with the argument that female use of open urinals is socially unacceptable and associated with embarrassment. However, urinating in the company of others can be a problem for some males as well. There is always the possibility to switch to a classical toilet stall if that the use of urinals is associated with shame (\"e.g.\", in the case of paruresis).\nThis problem arises all the more in the context of the increasing development towards unisex toilets for males and females. A pooling of toilets raises the question of how urinals should be arranged for both sexes in the room. While toilets are usually housed in booths with lockable doors, urinals are usually installed freely in a row in gender-separated toilets. This construction method requires less space and thus allows more people to urinate at the same time while promoting better hygiene and economics, which is currently one of the main advantages of male urinals. One possibility would be to continue offering urinals in rows. These could, whether separated into male and female urinals or as unisex urinals, be separated by so-called pubic walls.\n\nHowever, it is questionable whether the lower level of privacy compared to conventional toilets would be accepted. Due to socio-cultural conventions, the open use of urinals by men/boys in front of women/girls would likely create awkwardness for both genders and would currently seem strange and contrary to common morals and etiquette for many users. There are even more practical issues for females, such as women/girls needing toilet paper, having to lower their pants, and sometimes tending to their menstrual hygiene needs while going to the toilet for urination.\n\nAn alternative would be to accommodate urinals for both sexes in cabins or to continue offering urinals for males only. However, this would at least limit the above-mentioned advantages of the urinals for females. Accordingly, the German lawyer and author Marcus Werner sees a significant disadvantage in unisex toilets if these would lead to the elimination of urinals in classic row order:\n\nUrinals arranged in cabins have not been popular, since the advantages compared to conventional toilets were not obvious, given the unchanged space requirement. After 13 years, the four ladies' urinals in the Salzburg Congress Center were removed in August 2015 due to a lack of interest. They have been replaced by conventional toilets.\nIn the unisex toilets planned for the Alamo Drafthouse in Austin (Texas) in 2017, the urinals are to be located in an area separated from the entrance area by a door. These are designed as unisex urinals and are arranged in open rows within this range. This would allow men and women to use side-by-side urinals in this room, while those who prefer to not see persons of the opposite sex peeing may use traditional toilet cabins nearby. According to Richard Weiss, the architect who is planning this restroom, this would create the greatest possible freedom of choice for all genders:\n\n\n\n"}

Jobe pioneered both elbow ligament replacement and major reconstructive shoulder surgery for baseball players.\n\nIn 1974, Jobe performed the first \"Tommy John surgery\" on then-Los Angeles Dodgers pitcher Tommy John. The procedure has become so prevalent an estimated one-third of all major league pitchers have undergone it. Jobe also performed the first major reconstructive shoulder surgery on a big league player in 1990, which allowed Dodger star Orel Hershiser to continue his career. Jobe served as a special adviser to the team until his death.\n\nFrank Jobe was born in 1925 in Greensboro, North Carolina. After graduating from Collegedale Academy in Collegedale, Tennessee in 1943, he enlisted in the United States Army and reported to Camp Barkeley for training. Serving in World War II as a medical staff sergeant in the Army's 101st Airborne Division, he landed by glider at Normandy and later was briefly captured during the Siege of Bastogne in the Battle of the Bulge. Successfully escaping, he went on to earn the Bronze Star Medal, Combat Medical Badge, and Glider Badge with one star.\n\nAfter the war, Jobe enrolled in Southern Missionary College with help from the G.I. Bill. He completed his bachelor's degree at La Sierra University and went on to medical school at Loma Linda University, receiving his MD in 1956. He worked for three years as a general practitioner before completing a residency in orthopedic surgery at the Los Angeles County Hospital.\n\nIn 1964 Jobe began to consult with the Los Angeles Dodgers. He teamed with Dr. Robert Kerlan to specialize in the developing field of sports medicine. The duo co-founded the Southwestern Orthopaedic Medical Group in 1965, later renamed the Kerlan-Jobe Orthopaedic Clinic. Jobe officially joined the Dodgers' medical staff in 1968.\n\nAlong with the Dodgers, the clinic supervised medical treatment for the California Angels of Major League Baseball, the Los Angeles Rams of the National Football League, and the Los Angeles Lakers of the National Basketball Association. They eventually worked for the Los Angeles Kings and the Anaheim Ducks of the National Hockey League, as well as a large number of other professional and amateur athletes from across the country.<ref name=\"drjobehof.org/biography\"></ref>\n\nOn September 25, 1974, Jobe made sports medicine history when he performed the first reconstruction of the ulnar collateral ligament of the elbow (UCL) using a revolutionary procedure he had devised.\n\nWhat has since become commonly known as Tommy John surgery rescued the career of Los Angeles Dodger pitcher Tommy John, a 12-year veteran who went on to pitch an astonishing 14 more seasons after a year off recovering. A one-time All-Star who had never had more than 16 wins in a season, John went on to three 20-win seasons, three more All-Star appearances, and two second place Cy Young votes post-surgery.\n\nJobe was unsure the procedure's benefits would last, so he waited two years before performing the second UCL reconstruction. After success with several more baseball players and a javelin thrower, Jobe became confident in its lasting benefits. The findings of UCL reconstruction were published in the \"Journal of Bone and Joint Surgery\" in 1986.\n\nIn the four decades since its inception elbow ligament replacement has become common practice for pitchers and players at all levels of baseball, with an estimated one-third of all Major League pitchers in 2014 having undergone it. What Jobe had estimated as a 1 in 100 prospect of a complete recovery for John had risen to 85–92 percent by 2009.\n\nFor baseball players, full rehabilitation takes about one year for pitchers and about six months for position players. Players typically begin throwing about 16 weeks after surgery. Prior to his surgery, John had won 124 games. He won 164 after surgery, retiring in 1989 at age 46. Other pitchers to extend their careers after Tommy John surgery include Stephen Strasburg, David Wells, A. J. Burnett, Francisco Liriano, Chris Carpenter, Tim Hudson, John Smoltz, Joe Nathan, Brian Wilson, Billy Wagner, and Matt Harvey. Sandy Koufax, who suffered a similar injury to John's in 1966, once asked Jobe \"why didn’t you do that on me?\"\n\nThe initial Tommy John surgery, John's return to pitching success, and the relationship between the two men was the subject of a 2013 ESPN \"30 for 30 Shorts\" documentary.\n\nIn 1990, Jobe performed major reconstructive surgery on the shoulder of Dodgers pitcher Orel Hershiser's throwing arm, the first time this procedure was used on a major league player. In this surgery, he pioneered a new procedure that reduced the amount of trauma suffered by tissue during the surgery. The surgery allowed Hershiser to continue his career, and the procedure continues to be used.\n\nJobe served as Clinical Professor, Department of Orthopedics, for The Keck School of Medicine at the University of Southern California. For 40 years, Jobe served as the team physician for the Los Angeles Dodgers, remaining on their medical staff through 2008. At the time of his death he was a special advisor to the chairman of the Dodger organization. He had also been the orthopedic consultant for professional golf's PGA and Champions Tours for 26 years, and named the emeritus physician for the PGA Tour. Jobe mentored Lewis Yocum, who was one of the best orthopedic surgeons in baseball when he died in May 2013.\n\nJobe authored over 140 medical publications, wrote 30 book chapters, and edited seven books. He received three honorary doctorates, two from the United States and one from Japan.\n\nJobe met his future wife Beverly Anderson while working as a general practitioner and she was referred to him as a patient. Rather than treat her himself, he had another doctor treat her so the pair could date. They had four sons, who had eight grandchildren.\n\nJobe underwent coronary artery bypass surgery on four arteries in 2002 and had a defibrillator implanted in 2010. He died on March 6, 2014, at the age of 88, in Santa Monica, California. Jobe was a lifelong member of the Seventh-day Adventist Church.\n\nBaseball Commissioner Bud Selig issued a statement on Jobe's death saying, \"I was deeply saddened to learn of the loss of Dr. Frank Jobe, a great gentleman whose work in baseball revolutionized sports medicine. Since 1974, his groundbreaking Tommy John surgery has revitalized countless careers, especially those of our pitchers.\" Steve Dilbeck of \"The Los Angeles Times\" referred to Jobe as a \"legend\" and said \"it could be argued that Jobe is the greatest orthopedic surgeon in history\", while James Andrews called Jobe \"one of the premier fathers of modern sports medicine\", saying that \"without his influence, baseball players' sports-medicine care would probably still be in the dark ages.\"\n\nJobe's name has periodically been informally mentioned by sportswriters, fans, and players alike as worthy of a nomination for the National Baseball Hall of Fame. In August 2012, an official campaign Web site to have Frank Jobe honored by the National Baseball Hall of Fame was launched.\n\nJobe was honored during Hall of Fame weekend on July 27, 2013, in Cooperstown, New York. Hall of Fame president Jeff Idelson said Jobe's work is a testament to the positive role of medicine in baseball's growth. Tommy John attended, praising Jobe by saying, \"I think there should be a medical wing in the Hall of Fame, starting with him.\"\n"}

Its founder, Prof. George Eliava, was not aware of bacteriophages until 1919-1921. In those years he met Felix d'Herelle during a visit to the Pasteur Institute in Paris. There, Eliava was enthusiastic about the potential of phages in the curing of bacterial disease, and invited d'Herelle to visit his laboratory in Georgia.\n\nD'Herelle visited Tbilisi twice in 1933-34, and agreed to work with Prof. Eliava. It has been suggested that d'Herelle became enamored of the communist idea. In 1934, Joseph Stalin invited d'Herelle to the institute in Tbilisi; he accepted and worked there for about 18 months. D'Herelle dedicated one of his books to Stalin, \"The Bacteriophage and the Phenomenon of Cure\", written and published in Tbilisi in 1935.\n\nD'Herelle had planned to take up permanent residence in Tbilisi and had started to build a cottage on the grounds of the Institute; it would later house the KGB's Georgian headquarters.\n\nHowever, the collaboration between the two scientists was not to be. Around the time d'Herelle was to take up residence, in 1937 George Eliava was executed and denounced as an enemy of the people. D'Herelle fled from Tbilisi and, some believe, never returned. Another account states that he was in Paris at the time of Eliava's execution, and decided not to return. D'Herelle's book was also banned from distribution.\n\nIn spite of this development, the institute did not change its practical specialization, and continued its activity in the field of bacteriophage research. In 1938, the Institute of Bacteriophage Research and the Institute of Microbiology & Epidemiology (founded separately in 1936) merged, and the Institute of Microbiology, Epidemiology and Bacteriophage was formed. It existed until 1951 and was authorized by the People's Commissary of Health of Georgia. After 1951, it came under the auspices of the All-Union Ministry of Health and was renamed The Institute of Vaccine and Sera.\n\nSince its inception, the institute was composed of a combination of industrial and scientific (research) departments. In 1988 the Institute was rearranged again and emerged as the Scientific Industrial Union \"Bacteriophage\" (SIU \"Bacteriophage\"). Around that time, its scientific portion was renamed the George Eliava Research Institute of Bacteriophage.\n\nBased on the original intentions of D'Herelle and Eliava, the Bacteriophage Institute retained its leadership among other institutes of similar profile over the years. Teimuraz Chanishvili was the leader of the scientific part of the institute for over 30 years, until his death in August 2007.\n\nThe institute in Tbilisi became a general Soviet institute for the development and production of bacteriophage drugs. Patients with serious infectious diseases came from all over the Soviet Union to receive treatments there. Bacteriophages became a routine part of treatment in clinics and hospitals. Ointments for the skin, and pills, drops, and rinses consisting of phages were sold and are still sold at pharmacies throughout Eastern Europe at low prices.\n\nAfter the Republic of Georgia declined to join the Russian Federation and the Georgian Civil War broke out in 1991, the Tbilisi facility was essentially ruined. The Eliava Institute's facilities were damaged and decades of research on bacteriophage nearly went down the drain. Thousands of bacteriophage samples identified over the years and catalogued in huge, refrigerated \"libraries\" suffered irreversible damage due to frequent electrical outages. Apparently, the Russians transferred some of the equipment to their territory and built plants for the production of bacteriophages in other locations. Clearly, they recognized the importance of the research and also that of continued bacteriophage therapy. The situation at the Eliava Institute continued to deteriorate until it was on the verge of closure.\n\nHowever, in 1997, a report on the institute was broadcast by the BBC, sparking a flurry of media interest in the West. The headlines drew doctors and scientists to Tbilisi - and also, most importantly, energetic entrepreneurs from around the world who were determined to help save the institute and its stocks and fully explore the potential of this \"new\" and highly effective therapy. Georgian scientists whose names were connected in some way to the institute saw great opportunity, and some of them emigrated to the West to be part of joint projects. Some of the institute's projects with the rest of the world can be seen on the website of the Georgian Academy of Sciences, the umbrella entity which now includes the Eliava Institute.\n\nDr. Revaz Adamia is a present director of the Eliava Institute.\n\nThe Institute includes the following laboratories: Laboratory of Physiology of Microorganisms, Laboratory of Biochemistry, Laboratory of Morphology of Bacteriophages, Laboratory of Immunology (includes the group of Virology), Laboratory of Standardization and Deposing of Bacteriophages (includes the group of Brucella and Anaerobic Bacteriophages), Laboratory of Biotechnology and Gene Engineering (includes the group of Selection and Taxonomy of Bacteriophages), Laboratory of Microbial Ecology, and Laboratory for Genetics of Microorganisms and Bacteriophages.\n\n\n\n"}

In the negotiations to form a coalition government following the elections, Gröhe was part of the 15-member leadership circle chaired by Merkel, Horst Seehofer and Sigmar Gabriel.\n\nFollowing the formation of the third cabinet of Chancellor Angela Merkel, Gröhe took office as Federal Minister of Health. His deputies were Ingrid Fischbach and Annette Widmann-Mauz.\n\nIn October 2014, Gröhe's elderly care reform bill, which is supposed to better fit the individual needs of those in care and expected to cost the government a further 1.2 billion euro ($1.5 billion), was passed by the Bundestag.\n\nIn December 2014, Gröhe was surprisingly contested by Jens Spahn for a place on the CDU’s ruling council, in a move that was widely seen as crystallizing the generational tensions within the party. Spahn’s election bid was backed by the then 72-year-old finance minister, Wolfgang Schäuble. Shortly before the vote at the annual CDU party conference, Gröhe withdrew his candidacy and Spahn was elected.\n\nDuring his time in office, Gröhe also focused heavily on global health issues. Alongside his colleague Gerd Müller, he travelled to Ghana and Liberia right after the West African Ebola virus epidemic in 2015. That same year, he accompanied Merkel when she spoke at the opening of the annual World Health Assembly in Geneva on the need for reforming the World Health Organization (WHO) to ensure there is prompt response to health emergencies. As part of Germany's G7 presidency in 2015, he brought together G7 Health Ministers to adopt a declaration addressing antimicrobial resistance (AMR).\n\nIn March 2016, Gröhe was appointed by United Nations Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon to the High-Level Commission on Health Employment and Economic Growth, which was co-chaired by presidents François Hollande of France and Jacob Zuma of South Africa. He later led Germany's delegation to the 2016 High Level Meeting on Ending AIDS in New York.\n\nAhead of the 2017 elections, Gröhe was elected to lead his party’s campaign in the state of North Rhine-Westphalia, Germany’s most populous state. In the negotiations to form a fourth coalition government under Merkel, he led the working group on health policy, alongside Malu Dreyer and Georg Nüßlein. \n\nSince March 2018, Gröhe has been serving as deputy chairman of the CDU/CSU parliamentary group under the leadership of Volker Kauder. In this capacity, he oversees the group’s initiatives on social affairs and development policy. He was also appointed to the Pension Commission of the Federal Ministry of Labour and Social Affairs, a body mandated to draft recommendations for Germany’s old-age pension system. \n\n\nAddressing a United Nations \"interfaith\" meeting in 2008, Gröhe defended the right to convert to another faith, a right not recognized in some Muslim countries; he called it \"unacceptable that up until now laws in some countries threaten those who want to convert with the death penalty.\"\n\nAfter a 18-month-old boy died of measles in Berlin in 2015, Gröhe warned publicly that \"those who refuse to vaccinate their children endanger not only them but others, threatening serious health problems.\"\n\nIn June 2017, Gröhe voted against Germany’s introduction of same-sex marriage.\n\nGröhe is married with former hospital administrator Heidi Oldenkott-Gröhe; they have four children. He is a Protestant.\n"}

Specifically, the HCHDS has collaborated with JHU- based organizational entities as well as the National Institute on Aging, Laboratory of Cellular and Molecular Biology of the Gerontology Research Center; Shaw University; Operation Reach Out South West (OROSW); and Nora, LLC. The HCHDS has been designated as a national Comprehensive Center of Excellence in Health Disparities by the NCMHD of the National Institutes of Health, and in 2007 was awarded a second 5-year grant to continue its work. The Center has a national focus although much of the actual work takes place in the local Baltimore, Maryland community.\n\nThe Hopkins Center for Health Disparities Solutions was established in October 2002 with a 5-year grant from the National Center for Minority Health and Health Disparities (NCMHD), of the National Institutes of Health (NIH) under the Centers of Excellence in Partnerships for Community Outreach, Research on Health Disparities, and Training program (Project EXPORT).\n\nThe mission of the Hopkins Center for Health Disparities Solutions is to generate and disseminate knowledge to reduce racial/ethnic and social class disparities in health status and health care through research, training, community partnerships, and advocacy.\n\nThis is a large-scale collaborative study consisting of determinants of disparities in chronic conditions. Progress in understanding the nature of health disparities requires data that are race-comparative while overcoming confounding between race, socioeconomic status (SES), and segregation. The EHDIC study is a multi-cohort study that addresses these confounders by examining the nature of health disparities within racially integrated communities without racial disparities in SES.\n\nOverweight and obesity is an epidemic in the United States, particularly among minority populations. This epidemic contributes to the development of chronic conditions that occur later in life such as Type 2 diabetes and hypertension. The center conducted a cross-sectional survey among students graduating from a Historically Black College or University (HBCU) in the Mid-Atlantic Region. Participants were 392 predominately African- American seniors graduating in the spring of 2003. Data were collected using a self-administered paper and pencil questionnaire which focuses on weight, weight management activities, weight history, and health status indicators.\n\nThis is a study to examine the validity of the psychometric properties of a new measure of trust/ mistrust of medical care systems. Trust is the foundation of the interrelationships that make civil society possible and the important of trust within healthcare is no less critical. Patients are inherently vulnerable within medical encounters and must be trustful of the multiple institutional entities and individuals involved in their care. Patients must trust that individual healthcare providers are competent and will have their best interest in mind while making treatment decisions. They must trust that the pharmaceutical companies have developed effective drugs and that the regulatory agencies have adequately monitored them. And, they must trust that the healthcare organization and that its staff will manage their medical information with discretion and confidentially.\n\nThe Hispanic community in Baltimore City, the Baltimore City Health Department, HCHDS, and other important stakeholders worked together to examine the understanding of contextual factors (i.e., community/neighborhood and societal) that contribute to the high rates of tobacco use in the Hispanic community, with a focus on the population ages 18–24.\n\nParental knowledge of child health and development issues can have important effects on child health. Greater awareness of the content areas in which parents require more guidance can help clinicians devise parent-centered strategies to reduce identified knowledge deficits and may both increase the quality of care and reduce disparities in child health. The primary goal of this pilot project is to develop a set of parental health knowledge assessment questions relevant to physical activity in children 5 years or younger and to conduct preliminary reliability and validity studies \nof these questions.\n\nThe Kellogg Community Scholars and The Urban Health Institute Fellows are both Postdoctoral training opportunities found at Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health that address health disparities-related issues.\n\nThe goal of the Community Health Scholars Program (CHSP) is to increase the number of faculty at health professional schools, with an emphasis on schools of public health, who possess the capacity to carry out community-based participatory research and teaching and who understand determinants of community health and how to build the capacity of communities, health-related agencies and academic centers to function as equal partners in community-based research, service and education.\n\nThe goal of the UHI Postdoctoral Research Fellowship program is to promote future leaders in the field of urban health research. The fellows, each working in tandem with a Hopkins faculty member, carry out scholarly research and publication on such issues as crime, unemployment, poverty, substance abuse, diabetes, hypertension and other chronic diseases.\n\nIn addition to offering Doctoral and master's degrees, the Bloomberg School of Public Health also offers certificates of concentration in subspecialties in public health. Thus, a student can obtain a Doctoral or master's degree from any one of the ten departments that comprise the Bloomberg School of Public Health, and also earn an optional certificate in a specialized topic area. The school currently offers certificates in 21 topic areas, including the Certificate Program in Health Disparities and Health Inequality, established by Drs. LaVeist and Gaskin in 2003. The program is open to students enrolled in any graduate degree program at Johns Hopkins University.\n\nClearview360 offers a suite of survey tools developed by researchers at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health.

The event will be held July 5–8, 2012 at the Renaissance Baltimore Harborplace Hotel in Baltimore, Maryland, USA. The conference is organized by the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health and funded in part by a grant from the W.K. Kellogg Foundation. In 2011, HCHDS established the ICHAD project with a $400,000 grant from the W.K. Kellogg Foundation, marking a planned expansion of the HCHDS vision and programs.\n\nEstablished in Fall 2003, \"Critical Issues in Health Disparities\" is a journal club that focuses on health disparities, inequalities and inequities. The aim of the club is to facilitate increased understanding of the issues and controversies relative to these topics by creating opportunities for students, staff and faculty members.\n\n\nThe journal club has a strong focus on racial/ethnic health disparities in the U.S. Topics for discussion include:\n\n\n\n\nAdditional Publications\n\n"}
{"id": "47908493", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=47908493", "title": "In-depth-systemics", "text": "In-depth-systemics\n\nIn-depth systemics is a context independent professional work approach and an extension of the field of systemic therapy and counseling approaches. The following elements are integrated: (a) classical \"systemic (family) therapy\", (b) reconstructive work based on the principles of \"objective hermeneutics\", (c) \"coopetition\" as an expression of the dialectic relationship of cooperation and competition, and (d) as the central core element, \"Vipassana\"-meditation in the tradition of Sayagyi \"U Ba Khin\" as taught by S.N. \"Goenka\". Vipassana-meditation plays an essential role in the development of mindfulness and inner wisdom about oneself. It is an instrument to coordinate unconscious perceptions to reach a deeper dimension, which cannot be achieved through traditional therapeutic or counseling methods.\n\nThe development of in-depth systemics derives from therapeutic works of Gerhard Scholz and Sergio Mantovani with drug addicts in the early 1990s in Zürich (Switzerland). They observed that the root cause of drug addiction is a basic addiction to existence itself. Addiction is not (just) the craving for pharmaceutical substances but rather an existential desire and craving for pleasant physical sensations, which the consummation of drugs can produce. Hence, addiction is a deeply unconscious habitual way of mental reaction: craving for pleasant and aversion against unpleasant physical bodily sensations. These bodily sensations arise through various sensory stimuli and change constantly.\n\nThis innovative view of addiction can easily be applied to non-substance related addictions as well, such as gambling, online activities, sexuality, an excessive preoccupation with one’s looks, eating, sports, etc., as well as with secondary phenomena, such as the desire for power or prestige.\n\nAfter using in-depth systemics in stationary drug therapy since 1992, the model was extended in 2001 and first applied to the field of \"case management\" interventions (particularly high cost cases). The goal was not only a recovery from personal deficits but also to support the personal development and autonomy of clients. Later, in-depth systemics was applied to business leadership as well as the coaching of sport prodigies (competitive athletes). In 2010, a day center for youths and young adults was established, based on the principles of in-depth systemics, with the goal of offering clients a structure to motivate them to work on a long-term professional perspective.\n\nWhile working with heavy drug addicts, a model based on four pillars was designed: (1) daily life as therapy versus therapy as daily life, (2) systemic individual, partner, and family therapy, (3) various(?) self-help concepts, and (4) meditation techniques (Anapana-sati and Vipassana-meditation as taught by S.N. Goenka). The totality of these elements was included in the statutes of the association start again and labeled explicitly as \"in-depth systemics\".\n\nThe application of the work in various contexts (e.g., case management, business leadership, coaching of prodigies) required a strong redesign and extension of the model. Vipassana-meditation became the central core, because it provides the actual instrument to initiate real personal transformation. It empowers practitioners to perceive themselves in a direct, realistic, and undistorted way - from moment to moment in the here-and-now. The goal is the development of equanimity to counteract the habitual addictive attitude at the existential level: the acceptance of unpleasant sensations and the relinquishing of craving for pleasant physical sensations. As a result, the inner world is perceived accurately and realistically. Mediated through the sensory organs, the outer world is also perceived more accurately and undistorted. As a consequence, individual actions become freer from reactions, since decisions are less influenced by habitual inner reactions than by the particularities of the specific case. The achieved autonomy flows into the application of the principles of coopetition, qualification, and reconstructive understanding.\n\nThe extension of the addiction based model required the re-definition of elements: self-help was used to develop the dialectic concept of coopetition. Coopetition means that an individual experiences simultaneously aspects of cooperation as well as competition within every professional context. Both must be integrated in the dialectical sense to act efficiently and effectively professionally.\n\nSystemic therapy was translated into two parts: qualification and relational/reconstructive understanding. Qualification means that the minimum requirement but not the goal of every professional work context is the content-oriented qualification of the individual. Relational/reconstructive understanding on the other hand refers to the reconstructive ability, along the principles of the objective hermeneutics case analysis, to combine all available information of a case to work out its essential challenges.\n\nThe described three cornerstones of the model should not to be understood as fixed but might change depending on the particular working context. This is based on the conviction that the application of the model within a new context must be done each time anew to remain sensitive to the particularities of each case. However, the central core element of Vipassana-meditation remains fixed, because only through the practice of Vipassana-meditation and the observation of one’s own bodily sensations with equanimity can personal transformation of one's own mental-somatic models be realized.\n\nCentral for in-depth systemics work is the continuous practice of one’s own individual mental-somatic models through the practice of Vipassana-meditation as taught by S.N. Goenka. This ensures that apart from the ongoing development of professional qualifications, reconstructive understanding, and coopetition, the transformative processes in the depth of the mind are maintained. Vipassana-meditation can be learned in initial 10-day retreats, after which individuals can continue to practice the meditation technique autonomously.\n\nBetween 1992–1998, a scientific evaluation of the drug therapy center start again (Zürich/ CH) took place, which is based on in-depth systemics principles. The research study was financially supported by the Swiss federal office of justice. The task was to investigate whether \"therapy instead of prison\" in the context of severe drug addiction has a positive empirical outcome for the target group. A conservative criterion was chosen to define recovery from drug addiction empirically and to measure therapeutic success. The study followed a \"mixed-methods\" research design by combining qualitative as well as quantitative methodologies: case reconstructive work based on objective hermeneutical analysis as well as statistical calculations of therapeutic success by means of Bayesian statistics for small samples\n\nThe main results of the study showed that 2/3 of the clients who completed the whole therapeutic program could be classified as a success in accordance with the chosen conservative criterion for therapeutic success. No significant differences were found between men and women and between clients who participated voluntarily and those who chose a “therapy instead of prison” sentence. Vipassana-meditation was identified as an important predictor for the prevention of serious relapse. However, Vipassana-meditation did not predict therapeutic success. Urban Studer, the author of the study concluded that it is the institution with its in-depth systemics program as a whole that works rather than a single isolated factor.\n\nBetween 2007 and 2010, a qualitative catamnestic follow-up study with former clients of start again was conducted to reconstruct retrospectively their personal and professional biography after leaving the therapeutic program. Based on objective hermeneutical analyses, a model was developed to describe recovery from drug addiction. The model was applied to the clients’ life course after therapy and allowed the derivation of testable predictions. The model contains the following steps: (1) small steps, (2) small changes, (3) transformation of vulnerabilities to resources, and (4) the dissolution of the dependence on resources as well as vulnerabilities. The studied clients reached level (3) and one client showed evidence of level (4).\n\nA systematic scientific evaluation of in-depth systemics in case management, business leadership, and coaching of sports prodigies has not been conducted yet.\n"}

Often, users are uncertain about their exact medical situations, are unfamiliar with medical terminology, and hence have difficulty in coming up with the right search keywords. An intelligent medical search engine is specifically designed to address this challenge. It uses several techniques to improve its usability and search result quality. First, it uses an interactive questionnaire-based query interface to guide users to provide the most important information about their situations. Users perform search by selecting symptoms and answering questions rather than by typing keyword queries. Second, it uses medical knowledge (e.g., diagnostic decision trees) to automatically form multiple queries from a user' answers to the questions. These queries are used to perform search simultaneously. Third, it provides various kinds of help functions. For instance, if a user has made incorrect selections, does not know which symptoms to select, or cannot answer a question, he or she can invoke the search engine's help functionality and describe his or her health situation there. Then he or she will see multiple lists of help information, e.g., one list for relevance of unselected symptoms, and another list for relevance of alternate responses (to his or her selections). The contents of those lists are ranked using medical knowledge and specially designed medical information retrieval techniques.\n\n\n"}

The organization is headquartered in Brookline, Massachusetts USA.\n\nThe International Congress on Infectious Diseases (ICID) was established in 1983 as a scientific assembly for the exchange of research and clinical information of infectious diseases. The ICID takes place every two years in a different region of the world to ensure the meeting is accessible to all persons interested in attending. The congress is committed to assisting colleagues from low-resource countries, and draws physicians and microbiologists from a range of backgrounds and countries. Approximately 2,500 clinicians, researchers, academics, public health practitioners, experts and leaders from over 100 countries attend these meetings. Attendees are updated concerning advances and challenges in the area of HIV, respiratory infections including pneumonia and tuberculosis, enteric infections, emerging infectious diseases, diagnostic advances, infection control, antimicrobial resistance, malaria, and neglected infectious diseases. Congress events include plenary speakers, symposia, meet-the-expert and poster sessions, all of which provide a platform to network, exchange research findings, and collaborate on problem-solving strategies in the area of global infectious diseases.\n\nProMED-mail (also referred to as ProMED for short) is one of the largest publicly available Internet-based disease-reporting platforms. Healthcare professionals can post information related to diseases of human, animal, environmental, and agricultural importance following a One Health model.\n\n\"The International Journal of Infectious Diseases\" (\"IJID)\" is an open-access, peer-reviewed monthly journal that serves to convey information on the epidemiology, clinical evaluation, diagnosis, treatment, and control of infections. The journal’s primary audience includes infectious disease researchers and clinicians throughout the world. The Journal seeks to enhance the reader's understanding of the medical and cultural factors that affect infectious diseases in different regions, particularly those of under-resourced countries. This approach provides insight into outbreak characteristics with the opportunity to prevent morbidity and mortality associated with infectious diseases.\n\nThe International Meeting on Emerging Diseases (IMED) is held every two years and brings together leading scientists, clinicians, and policy makers to present innovative knowledge and breakthroughs in the area of emerging diseases. Meetings primarily focus on the discovery, detection, understanding, response, and preventative measures associated with outbreaks of emerging pathogens. With a central focus on the One Health model, participants recognize the inextricable link between human, animal, environmental health as they relate to the emergence and spread of diseases.\n\nThe Guide to Infection Control in the Hospital is a practical handbook for the management of nosocomial infections and the development of hospital-based infection control programs. This pocket-sized manual, in its 5th edition, contains 60 chapters that explain key principles and guidelines for reducing the rate of infections.

{"id": "153187", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=153187", "title": "Intracytoplasmic sperm injection", "text": "Intracytoplasmic sperm injection\n\nIntracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI ) is an in vitro fertilization (IVF) procedure in which a single sperm cell is injected directly into the cytoplasm of an egg. This technique is used in order to prepare the gametes for the obtention of embryos that may be transferred to a maternal uterus. With this method acrosome reaction is skipped.\n\nThere are several differences within classic IVF and ICSI. However, the steps to be followed before and after insemination are the same. In terms of insemination, ICSI needs one only sperm cell per oocyte, meanwhile IVF needs between 50 and 100 thousands. This is due to the fact that in IVF acrosome reaction has to take place and thousands of sperm cells have to be involved. Once fertilized, the egg is transformed into a proembryo and it has to be transferred to the uterus to continue its development.\n\nThe first human pregnancy generated by ICS was carried out in 1991 by Gianpiero Palermo and his team.\n\nRound spermatid injection (ROSI) is a technique of assisted reproduction whereby a round spermatid is injected into oocyte cytoplasm in order to achieve fertilization. This technique can be used to enable genetic fatherhood to some men who have no spermatozoa in the ejaculate (azoospermia) and in whom spermatozoa cannot be obtained surgically from the testicles. This condition is called nonobstructive or secretory azoospermia, as opposed to obstructive azoospermia, in which complete sperm production does occur in the testicles, and potentially fertilizing spermatozoa can be obtained by testicular sperm extraction (TESE) and used for ICSI. In cases of nonobstructive (secretory) azoospermia, on the other hand, testicular sperm production is blocked at different stages of the process of sperm formation (spermatogenesis). In those men in whom spermatogenesis is blocked at the stage of round spermatids, in which meiosis has already been completed, these round cells can successfully fertilize oocytes after being injected into their cytoplasm. Before the development of the ROSI technique, men with the arrest of spermatogenesis at the round spermatid stage could only have children with the use of donor spermatozoa.\n\nEven though many technical aspects of ROSI are similar to those of ICSI, there are also significant differences between both techniques. In the first place, as compared to spermatozoa, round spermatids do not possess easily perceptible morphological characteristics and are immotile. Consequently, the distinction between round spermatids and other round cells of similar size, such as leukocytes, is not an easy task. Moreover, the distinction between living round spermatids, to be used in ROSI, and dead round spermatids, to be discarded, needs specific methods and skills, not required in the case of ICSI where sperm cell viability can be easily evaluated on the basis of sperm motility in most cases. The microinjection procedure for ROSI also differs slightly from that of ICSI, since additional stimuli are needed to ensure proper oocyte activation after spermatid injection. If all requirements for round spermatid selection and injection are successfully met, the injected oocytes develop to early embryos and can be transferred to the mother’s uterus to produce pregnancy.\n\nThe first successful pregnancies and births with the use of ROSI were achieved in 1995 by Jan Tesarik and his team.The clinical potential of ROSI in the treatment of male infertility due to the total absence of spermatozoa has been corroborated recently by a publication reporting on the postnatal development of 90 babies born in Japan and 17 in Spain. Based on the evaluation of the babies born, no abnormalities attributable to the ROSI technique have been identified. \nThis procedure is most commonly used to overcome male infertility problems, although it may also be used where eggs cannot easily be penetrated by sperm, and occasionally in addition to sperm donation.\n\nIt can be used in teratozoospermia, because once the egg is fertilized, abnormal sperm morphology does not appear to influence blastocyst development or blastocyst morphology. Even with severe teratozoospermia, microscopy can still detect the few sperm cells that have a \"normal\" morphology, allowing for optimal success rate.\n\nThe first child born from a gamete micromanipulation (technique in which special tools and inverted microscopes are used that help embryologists to choose and pick an individual sperm for ICSI IVF) was a child in Singapore-born in April 1989.\n\nThe technique was developed by Gianpiero Palermo at the Vrije Universiteit Brussel, in the Center for Reproductive Medicine headed by Paul Devroey and Andre Van Steirteghem.\n\nThe procedure itself was first performed in 1987, though it only went to the pronuclear stage. The first activated embryo by ICSI was produced in 1990, but the first successful birth by ICSI took place on January 14, 1992 after an April 1991 conception.\n\nSharpe \"et al\" comment on the success of ICSI since 1992 saying, \"[t]hus, the woman carries the treatment burden for male infertility, a fairly unique scenario in medical practice. ICSI’s success has effectively diverted attention from identifying what causes male infertility and focused research onto the female, to optimize the provision of eggs and a receptive endometrium, on which ICSI’s success depends.\"\n\nICSI is generally performed following a transvaginal oocyte retrieval procedure to extract one to several oocytes from a woman.\n\nIn ICSI IVF, the male partner or a donor provides a sperm sample on the same day when the eggs are collected. The sample is checked in the lab, and if no sperm is present, doctors will extract sperm from the epididymis or testicle. The extraction of sperm from epididymis is also known as percutaneous epididymal sperm aspiration (PESA) and extraction of sperm from testicle is also known as testicular sperm aspiration (TESA).\n\nThe procedure is done under a microscope using multiple micromanipulation devices (micromanipulator, microinjectors and micropipettes). A holding pipette stabilizes the mature oocyte with gentle suction applied by a microinjector. From the opposite side a thin, hollow glass micropipette is used to collect a single sperm, having immobilised it by cutting its tail with the point of the micropipette. The oocyte is pierced through the oolemma and the sperm is directed into the inner part of the oocyte (cytoplasm). The sperm is then released into the oocyte. The pictured oocyte has an extruded polar body at about 12 o'clock indicating its maturity. The polar body is positioned at the 12 or 6 o'clock position, to ensure that the inserted micropipette does not disrupt the spindle inside the egg. After the procedure, the oocyte will be placed into cell culture and checked on the following day for signs of fertilization.\n\nIn contrast, in natural fertilization sperm compete and when the first sperm penetrates the oolemma, the oolemma hardens to block the entry of any other sperm. Concern has been raised that in ICSI this sperm selection process is bypassed and the sperm is selected by the embryologist without any specific testing. However, in mid-2006 the FDA cleared a device that allows embryologists to select mature sperm for ICSI based on sperm binding to hyaluronan, the main constituent of the gel layer (cumulus oophorus) surrounding the oocyte. The device provides microscopic droplets of hyaluronan hydrogel attached to the culture dish. The embryologist places the prepared sperm on the microdot, selects and captures sperm that bind to the dot. Basic research on the maturation of sperm shows that hyaluronan-binding sperm are more mature and show fewer DNA strand breaks and significantly lower levels of aneuploidy than the sperm population from which they were selected. A brand name for one such sperm selection device is PICSI. A recent clinical trial showed a sharp reduction in miscarriage with embryos derived from PICSI sperm selection.\n\n'Washed' or 'unwashed' sperm may be used in the process.\n\nLive birth rate are significantly higher with progesterone to assist implantation in ICSI cycles. Also, addition of a GNRH agonist has been estimated to increase success rates.\nUltra-high magnification sperm injection (IMSI) has no evidence of increased live birth or miscarriage rates compared to standard ICSI.\n\nPeople who have experienced repeated failed implantation or who have a thick zona pellucida (covering around the embryo) are ideal candidates for assisted zona hatching. The procedure involves creating a hole in the zona to improve the chances of normal implantation of the embryo in the uterus.\n\nPGD is a process in which one or two cells from an embryo on Day 3 or Day 5 are extracted and the cells genetically analyzed. Couples who are at a high risk of having abnormal number of chromosomes or who have an history of single gene defects or chromosome defects are ideal candidates for this procedure. It is used to diagnose a large number of genetic defects at present.\n\nOne of the areas in which sperm injection can be useful is vasectomy reversal. However, potential factors that may influence pregnancy rates (and live birth rates) in ICSI include level of DNA fragmentation as measured e.g. by comet assay, advanced maternal age and semen quality.\n\nA systematic meta-analysis of 24 estimates of DNA damage based on a variety of techniques concluded that sperm DNA damage negatively affects clinical pregnancy following ICSI.\n\nThere is some suggestion that birth defects are increased with the use of IVF in general, and ICSI specifically, though different studies show contradictory results. In a summary position paper, the Practice Committee of the American Society of Reproductive Medicine has said it considers ICSI safe and effective therapy for male factor infertility, but may carry an increased risk for the transmission of selected genetic abnormalities to offspring, either through the procedure itself or through the increased inherent risk of such abnormalities in parents undergoing the procedure.\n\nThere is not enough evidence to say that ICSI procedures are safe in females with hepatitis B in regard to vertical transmission to the offspring, since the puncture of the oocyte can potentially avail for vertical transmission to the offspring.\n\nIn addition to regular prenatal care, prenatal aneuploidy screening based on maternal age, nuchal translucency scan and biomarkers is appropriate. However, biomarkers seem to be altered for pregnancies resulting from ICSI, causing a higher false-positive rate. Correction factors have been developed and should be used when screening for Down syndrome in singleton pregnancies after ICSI, but in twin pregnancies such correction factors have not been fully elucidated. In vanishing twin pregnancies with a second gestational sac with a dead fetus, first trimester screening should be based solely on the maternal age and the nuchal translucency scan as biomarkers are significantly altered in these cases.\n\n\n\n"}

In Gestalt psychology, Isomorphism is the idea that perception and the underlying physiological representation are similar because of related Gestalt qualities. Isomorphism refers to a correspondence between a stimulus array and the brain state created by that stimulus, and is based on the idea that the objective brain processes underlying and correlated with particular phenomenological experiences functionally have the same form and structure as those subjective experiences.\n\nIsomorphism can also be described as the similarity in the gestalt patterning of a stimulus and the activity in the brain while perceiving the stimulus. More generally, this concept is an expression of the materialist view that the properties of mind and consciousness are a direct consequence of the electrochemical interactions within the physical brain.\n\nA commonly used example of isomorphism is the phi phenomenon, in which a row of lights flashing in sequence creates the illusion of motion. It is argued that the brain state created by this stimulus matches the brain state created by a patch of light moving from one location to another. The stimulus is perceived as motion because the subjective percept of spatial structure is correlated with electric fields in the brain whose spatial pattern mirrors the spatial structure in the perceived world.\n"}

{"id": "265004", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=265004", "title": "John C. Lilly", "text": "John C. Lilly\n\nDr John Cunningham Lilly (January 6, 1915 – September 30, 2001) was an American physician, neuroscientist, psychoanalyst, psychonaut, philosopher, writer and inventor. He was a member of a generation of counterculture scientists and thinkers that included Ram Dass, Werner Erhard and Timothy Leary, all frequent visitors to the Lilly home. He never failed to stir controversy, especially among mainstream scientists. He gained renown in the 1950s after developing the isolation tank. He saw the tanks, in which users are isolated from almost all external stimuli, as a means to explore the nature of human consciousness. He later combined that work with his efforts to communicate with dolphins, as well as experiments with psychedelics.\n\nDuring a session in an isolation tank, constructed over a pool where dolphins were swimming, I participated in a conversation between the dolphins. It drove me crazy, there was too much information, they communicated so fast.\n\nHis work inspired two Hollywood movies, \"The Day of the Dolphin\" and \"Altered States\".\n\nHe was a graduate of the California Institute of Technology and the University of Pennsylvania medical school. He conducted high-altitude research during World War II and later trained as a psychoanalyst.\n\nIn the 1950s, he began studying how bottlenose dolphins vocalize, establishing centers in the U.S. Virgin Islands and, later, San Francisco to study dolphins. A decade later, he began experimenting with psychedelics, including LSD, often while floating in isolation. \n\nLilly was born to a wealthy family on January 6, 1915, in Saint Paul, Minnesota. His father was Richard Coyle Lilly, president of the First National Bank of St. Paul. His mother was Rachel Lenor Cunningham, whose family owned the Cunningham & Haas Company, a large stockyards company in St. Paul. Lilly had an older brother, Richard Lilly Jr., and a younger brother, David Maher Lilly. A fourth child, Mary Catherine Lilly, died in infancy.\n\nLilly showed an interest in science at an early age. At thirteen years old, he was an avid chemistry hobbyist, supplementing his makeshift basement laboratory with chemicals given to him by a pharmacist friend. Students at his parochial Catholic grade school called him \"Einstein Jr.\" At age 14 he enrolled at St. Paul Academy, a college preparatory academy for boys, where his teachers encouraged him to pursue science further and conduct his experiments in the school laboratory after hours.\n\nWhile at SPA, Lilly also further developed his interest in philosophy. He studied the works of many of the great philosophers, finding himself especially attracted to the subjective idealism of Anglo-Irish theologian and philosopher George Berkeley.\n\nDespite his father's wish that he go to an eastern Ivy League university to become a banker, Lilly received a scholarship at the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena, California where he studied biology. He was the president of the ski club, a member of the drama club and lived in one of the Blacker Houses. After his first year, Caltech learned that Lilly was from a wealthy family and cancelled his scholarship, forcing him to go to his father for help. Dick Lilly set up a trust fund to pay the tuition and eventually became a benefactor of the college. Lilly continued to draw on his family wealth to fund his scientific pursuits throughout his life.\n\nIn 1934, Lilly read Aldous Huxley's \"Brave New World.\" The pharmacological control methods of Huxley's dystopia and the links between physical chemical processes of the brain and subjective experiences of the mind helped inspire Lilly to give up his study of physics and pursue biology, eventually focusing on neurophysiology.\n\nLilly was engaged to Mary Crouch at the beginning of his junior year at Caltech. Months before their wedding, he took a job with a lumber company in the Northwest to soothe a bout of \"nervous exhaustion\" brought on by the pressures of academia and his upcoming marriage. During this sabbatical he was hospitalised after injuring his foot with an axe while cutting brush. His time in the trauma ward inspired him to become a doctor of medicine.\n\nIn 1937, while Lilly was looking for a good medical school, his wealthy and well-connected father arranged a meeting between Lilly and Charles Horace Mayo of the famous Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minnesota. Following Mayo's advice, Lilly applied and was accepted to Dartmouth Medical School in Hanover, New Hampshire, where he became good friends with Mayo's son, Charles William Mayo. Lilly graduated from Caltech with a Bachelor of Science degree on June 10, 1938, and enrolled at Dartmouth the following September.\n\nAt Dartmouth, Lilly launched into the study of anatomy, performing dissections on 32 cadavers during his time there. He once stretched out an entire intestinal tract across the length of a room to determine its actual length with certainty.\n\nDuring the summer after his first year at Dartmouth, Lilly returned to Pasadena to participate in an experiment with his former Caltech biochemistry professor Henry Borsook. The purpose of the experiment was to study the creation of glycocyamine, a major source of muscle power in the human body. The experiment involved putting Lilly on a completely protein-free diet while administering measured doses of glycine and arginine, the two amino acids that Borsook hypothesized were involved in the creation of glycocyamine. The experiments pushed Lilly to extreme physical and mental limits; he became increasingly weak and delirious as the weeks went on. The results of the experiment confirmed Borsook's hypothesis and Lilly's name was included among the authors, making it the first published research paper of his career. It was also one of the first instances of a lifelong pattern of experimenting on his own body to the point of endangering his health.\n\nAfter two years at Dartmouth, Lilly decided that he wanted to pursue a career in medical research, rather than therapeutic practice as was standard for Dartmouth medical students at that time. He decided to transfer to the medical school at the University of Pennsylvania which would provide him with better opportunities for conducting research.\n\nAt the University of Pennsylvania, Lilly met Professor H. Cuthbert Bazett, a protege of British physiologist J. B. S. Haldane. Bazett introduced Lilly to Haldane's view that scientists should never conduct an experiment or procedure on another person that they have not first conducted on themselves, a view Lilly embraced and attempted to exemplify throughout his career. Bazett took a liking to the young, enthusiastic graduate student, and set Lilly up with his own research laboratory. While working under Bazett, Lilly created his first invention, the electrical capacitance diaphragm manometer, a device for measuring blood pressure. While designing the instrument, he received electrical engineering advice from biophysics pioneer Britton Chance. Chance also introduced Lilly to the world of computers, which was still in its infancy.\n\nWhile finishing his degree at the University of Pennsylvania, Lilly enrolled in a class entitled \"How to Build an Atomic Bomb\". He and several other students transcribed their notes from the class into a book with the same title. The director of the Manhattan Project, General Leslie Groves, attempted to suppress publication of the book, but was unable to because no classified data was used in writing the book.\n\nLilly graduated with a medical degree from the University of Pennsylvania in 1942.\n\nLilly was a physician and psychoanalyst. He made contributions in the fields of biophysics, neurophysiology, electronics, computer science, and neuroanatomy. He invented and promoted the use of an isolation tank as a means of sensory deprivation. He also attempted communication between humans and dolphins. His work helped the creation of the United States Marine Mammal Protection Act of 1972.\n\nLilly's eclectic career began as a conventional scientist doing research for universities and government. Gradually, however, he began researching unconventional topics. He published several books and had two Hollywood movies based partly on his work. He also developed theories for flotation.\n\nLilly published 19 books, including \"The Center of the Cyclone\", which describes his own LSD experiences, and \"Man and Dolphin\" and \"The Mind of the Dolphin\", which describe his work with dolphins.\n\nIn the 1980s Lilly directed a project that attempted to teach dolphins a computer-synthesised language. Lilly designed a future \"communications laboratory\" that would be a floating living room where humans and dolphins could chat as equals and develop a common language.\n\nLilly envisioned a time when all killing of whales and dolphins would cease, \"not from a law being passed, but from each human understanding innately that these are ancient, sentient earth residents, with tremendous intelligence and enormous life force. Not someone to kill, but someone to learn from.\"\nIn the 1990s Lilly moved to Maui, Hawaii, where he lived most of the remainder of his life.\n\nLilly's literary rights and scientific discoveries were owned by Human Software, Inc., while his philanthropic endeavors were owned by the Human Dolphin Foundation. The John C. Lilly Research Institute, Inc. continues to research topics of interest to Lilly and carry on his legacy.\n\nDuring World War II, Lilly researched the physiology of high-altitude flying and invented instruments for measuring gas pressure. After the war, he trained in psychoanalysis at the University of Pennsylvania, where he began researching the physical structures of the brain and consciousness. In 1951 he published a paper showing how he could display patterns of brain electrical activity on a cathode ray display screen using electrodes he devised specially for insertion into a living brain. Furthermore, Lilly's work on electrical stimulation of the nervous system gave rise to biphasic charge balanced electrical stimulation pulses (later known as \"Lilly's wave\" or \"Lilly's pulses\" ), now an established approach to design of safe electrical stimulation in neuroprosthetics. In the 1960s he sponsored research on Human–animal communication with a dolphin.\n\nIn 1953, Lilly began a job studying neurophysiology with the US Public Health Service Commissioned Officers Corps. At the N.I.M.H. in 1954, with the aim of isolating a brain from external stimulation, he devised the first isolation tank, a dark soundproof tank of warm salt water in which subjects could float for long periods in sensory isolation. Lilly and a research colleague were the first subjects of this research. What had been known as perceptual isolation or sensory deprivation was reconceptualized as Restricted Environmental Stimulation Technique (R.E.S.T.).\n\nLilly later studied other large-brained mammals and during the late 1950s he established a facility devoted to fostering human-dolphin communication: the Communication Research Institute on St. Thomas in the Virgin Islands. During the early 1960s, Lilly and coworkers published several papers reporting that dolphins could mimic human speech patterns.\n\nLilly was interested in the Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence (SETI) project. In 1961 a group of scientists including Lilly gathered at the Green Bank Observatory to discuss the possibility of using the techniques of radio astronomy to detect evidence of intelligent life outside the solar system. They called themselves \"The Order of the Dolphin\" after Lilly's work with dolphins. They discussed the Drake equation, used to estimate the number of communicative civilizations in our galaxy.\n\nIn the early 1960s, Lilly was introduced to psychedelic drugs such as LSD and (later) ketamine and began a series of experiments in which he ingested a psychedelic drug either in an isolation tank or in the company of dolphins. These events are described in his books \"Programming and Metaprogramming in the Human Biocomputer: Theory and Experiments\" and \"The Center of the Cyclone\", both published in 1972. Following advice from Ram Dass, Lilly studied Patanjali's system of yoga (finding I. K. Taimni's \"Science of Yoga\", a modernized interpretation of the Sanskrit text, most suited to his goals). He also paid special attention to self-enquiry meditation advocated by Ramana Maharshi, and reformulated the principles of this exercise with reference to his human biocomputer paradigm (described in \"Programming and Metaprogramming in the Human Biocomputer: Theory and Experiments\" and \"The Center of the Cyclone\").\n\nLilly later traveled to Chile and trained with the spiritual leader Oscar Ichazo (whose attitude to metaphysical consciousness exploration Lilly characterized as \"empirical\" in his book \"The Center of the Cyclone\"). Lilly claimed to have achieved the maximum degree of satori-samādhi consciousness during his training.\n\nLilly's maxim: \"In the province of the mind what one believes to be true, either is true or becomes true within certain limits. These limits are to be found experimentally and experientially. When so found these limits turn out to be further beliefs to be transcended. In the province of the mind there are no limits. However, in the province of the body there are definite limits not to be transcended.\"\n\nSolid State Intelligence (S.S.I.) is a malevolent entity described by Lilly (see \"The Scientist\"). According to Lilly, the network of computation-capable solid state systems (electronics) engineered by humans will eventually develop (or has already developed) into an autonomous bioform. Since the optimal survival conditions for this bioform (low-temperature vacuum) are drastically different from those humans need (room temperature aerial atmosphere and adequate water supply), Lilly predicted (or \"prophesied\", based on his ketamine-induced visions) a dramatic conflict between the two forms of intelligence.\n\nIn 1974, Lilly's research using various psychoactive drugs led him to believe in the existence of a certain hierarchical group of cosmic entities, the lowest of which he later dubbed Earth Coincidence Control Office (E.C.C.O.) in an autobiography published jointly with his wife Antonietta (often called Toni). To elaborate, \"There exists a Cosmic Coincidence Control Center (CCCC) with a Galactic substation called Galactic Coincidence Control (GCC). Within GCC is the Solar System Control Unit (SSCU), within which is the Earth Coincidence Control Office (ECCO).\"\n\nLilly also wrote that there are nine conditions that should be followed by people who seek to experience coincidence in their own lives:\n\n\nLilly died of heart failure at age 86 in Los Angeles on September 30, 2001. His remains were cremated.\n\nLilly's work with dolphins and the development of the sensory deprivation tank have been referenced in movies, music and television productions. \"Dolphin Island: A Story of the People of the Sea\" is a 1963 novel by Arthur C. Clarke set in a strange and fascinating research community where a brilliant professor tries to communicate with dolphins. In the 1972 novel \"The Listeners\", Lilly and the other scientists who were members of the \"Order of the Dolphin\" are mentioned as pioneers. In the 1973 movie \"The Day of the Dolphin\", George C. Scott portrayed a Lilly-esque scientist, known to the dolphins as \"Pa\", who succeeds in teaching a dolphin to speak elementary English.\n\nThe 1980 movie \"Altered States\", based on Paddy Chayefsky's novel of the same name, features actor William Hurt regressing to a simian form by ingesting psychoactive substances and then experiencing the effects of prolonged occupation of a sensory deprivation chamber.\n\nIn the 1992 Sega video game \"Ecco the Dolphin\", the player guides an intelligent dolphin through increasingly surreal psychedelic challenges. The game's producer, Ed Annunziata, has confirmed being an avid reader of Lilly's works.\n\nLayer 09 of the 1998 Japanese animation series \"Serial Experiments Lain\" makes reference to E.C.C.O. and Lilly's work with dolphins. The episode deals with the development of Protocol 7, a modification of The Wired, which is expected to network all humans without need of a device. The result will be that Earth's consciousness will awaken as people become linked nodes in The Wired network. This is compared to Lilly's view that dolphin communication is a form of long-distance networking.\n\nOysterhead's 2001 album, \"The Grand Pecking Order\", includes the song \"Oz is Ever Floating\", which includes numerous references to Lilly.\n\nIn the popular TV series \"Fringe\", brilliant but unstable scientist Walter Bishop develops a method for contacting dead relations by using ketamine and LSD-25 inside a deprivation tank.\n\n\n\n\n"}

OSHA is empowered to educate employers and workers, set workplace standards, and enforce violations. OSHA requires casinos to have a written safety plan specific to their location which commonly addresses topics that put workers at risk such as ergonomics, blood born pathogens, personal protective equipment, food service, housekeeping, and slips/trips/falls. Taken from regulations for sporting events, there are additional requirements for casino employees working in entertainment to help workers avoid hazards, injuries, and illness caused by theatrical scenery/rigging/props, wardrobe/hair/makeup, and audio/camera/projection/video/lighting. As of January 1, 2018, workers in Nevada have a 10 hour training course on these subject they must complete within 15 days of being hired. They must renew this certification every 5 years. These rules are in place to prevent workplace hazards, injuries, and deaths which have occurred during performances.\n\nThe U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) research agency the National Institute of Occupational Safety & Health (NIOSH) conducts free workplace Health Hazard Evaluation (HHE) under 29 U.S.C. 669(a)(6) to identify workplace health hazards and make recommends to reduce hazards. NIOSH has evaluated casinos in the United States regarding employee exposure to second hand smoke, noise, and metal coin dust.\n\nIn the United States, there are approximately 360,000 casino employees with the largest proportion (over 170,000) working in Nevada.\n\nFor workers in the United States, the most common injury is slip and falls (33%) followed by overexertion from lifting, carrying, pushing or pulling objects (23.4%).\n\nSecond hand smoke contains over 7,000 chemicals, 700 of which are known to cause cancer. It is the number one cause of preventable death in the United States causing 41,000 deaths among adults each year. The Surgeon General of the United States determined in 2006 that exposure to second hand smoke is not safe at any level as smoke cannot be filtered by ventilation systems and separate \"no smoking\" areas do not keep smoke out. More typically, the heating and cooling systems distribute smoke throughout the building, rather than removing it. Employees working in casinos have historically had higher levels of exposure to nicotine than other employees in the United States who reported exposure to second hand smoke. Second hand smoke among casino workers is estimated to cost $112 per casino worker, per year in direct medical costs. In 1995, when NIOSH evaluated non-smoking casino workers who worked in casinos that allowed smoking, NIOSH found these workers were exposed to elevated levels of nicotine in the air. The American Conference of Governmental Industrial Hygienists (ACGIH) publishes Threshold Limit Values (TLVs) for chemical and physical agents as well as Biological Exposure Indices (BEIs) each year that establishes a maximum exposure recommendation based on our current scientific knowledge. As of 2018, the ACGIH recommends employees not be exposed to an 8 hour time-weighted average (TWA) of more than 0.5 μg/m3 to prevent damage to the gastrointestinal tract, heart, brain or spinal cord. In studying these non-smoking casino workers, NIOSH found they were exposed to nicotine levels in the air of 6-12 μg/m3. The investigators also took urine samples of the workers to estimate the internal dose the workers were absorbing and found they had blood cotinine (a metabolite of nicotine) levels of 1.85 ng/ml after their shift. NIOSH monitored employees working in both \"smoking\" and \"non-smoking\" sections of the casino and found elevated levels of exposure in both, as measured in the air (externally) and in the worker's blood (internally). While all areas measured were above the recommended exposure limit, the highest concentrations were found at the poker tables. The national average at the time for non-smokers exposed in their work or home was 0.93 ng/ml. As a result of this study, NIOSH recommended that employees not be involuntarily exposed to smoke in the workplace. However, NIOSH is only a research agency and their recommendations do not have the force of law or ability to force employers to comply. Studies in casinos before and after smoking bans were enacted showed a decrease of 85-95% in cancer causing agents. Based on these studies, NIOSH expanded it's recommendation to make casinos in the United States 100% smoke free in 2009.\n\nEfficiently dealing or running table games often require workers to perform the same motion over and over for many hours. The repeated lifting and reaching needed to successfully run table games may lead to musculoskeletal injury (MSI). Considering workplace ergonomics can not only keep the employees safe, but can also keep the patrons comfortable, which will keep them at the tables longer. To prevent slip and falls, casino employers should establish well marked walking routes with changes in height marked by a visual signal. Employees should also be allowed to wear shoes with proper traction. Musculoskeletal injuries in casino workers are most common in the upper extremity, back, and legs. A table with a softer edge for the dealer to lean against will decrease nerve compression in the upper extremity. Carpal tunnel, a disorder caused by compressing the median nerve as it passes through the wrist into the hand, has been found more frequently in table game dealers. The American Conference of Governmental Industrial Hygienists provides a threshold limit value (TLV) for the upper extremity is is 0.78 and the action level is 0.56.\n\nThose who work the night shift are known to be at increased risk of insomnia, general morbidity, and all cause mortality. Studies of casino shift workers have found increased emotional and behavioral problems in their children as well as six time higher rate of divorce in men with children who have been married less than 5 years. Women with children were also three times more likely to get divorced while performing shift work at casinos. However, there was no increased rate of divorce in couples without children who performed shift work at casinos. Employers should try to minimize this risk by keeping each worker on a consistent shift, rather than rotating them between days and nights. If shift rotation must occur, it is better to rotate employees forward from day into evening shifts.\n\nAccording to the United States Bureau of Labor and Statistics, slip, trips, and falls were the leading cause of days away from work (DAFW) in 2017 causing 20,000 workers to miss one or more days. While only 1 in 6 slips and falls will result in missed days of work, those who do miss work are often absent for a lengthy period (11 days on average).\n\nIn casinos, these most commonly occur in preparation or delivery of foods, beverages, or oils since liquid or steam at only 155° Fahrenheit can burn or scald the skin. These burns can often be avoided with special precautions taken when cleaning deep fryers or pressure cookers. If possible full containers of liquids should not be carried as they can spill, especially on slippery or cluttered floors.\n\nEmotions can run high during gambling and this combined with alcohol which is often provided for free while playing can lead patrons to become aggressive and agitated toward the staff or other players. Casinos also frequently have large amounts of money present increasing the possibility of a robbery that can put an employee in a dangerous situation. Since there may be blood after a fight, employees should be trained how to take appropriate measures to protect against blood born pathogens.\n\nCasino workers have had panic attacks at work when the casino is understaffed.\n\nCasino employees are known to be at higher risk for gambling problems than the average person. Employers should offer education as a preventative strategy as well as treatment for employees who become addicted. Casino managers can protect their employees and patrons by tracking and excluding gambling addicts as well as limiting the amount one can lose in any 24 hour period.\n\nCasino employees are known to be at higher risk for alcohol problems than the average person. Employers should offer education as a preventative strategy as well as treatment for employees who become addicted to alcohol.\n\nCasino employees are known to be at higher risk for depression than the average person. Employers should offer education as a preventative strategy as well as treatment for employees who develop depression.\n\nCasinos can protect their employees from high levels of ambient noise by locating their performing entertainment and slot machines in a separate physical location. NIOSH has conducted one noise evaluation of a casino in 2003, but did not find any evidence that noise in that casino was loud enough to put employees at risk of hearing loss. As a preventative measure going forward, NIOSH recommended that noise levels be reevaluate whenever a new piece of equipment is installed or whenever employees express concerns about the noise level. NIOSH generally recommends that such noise assessments be conducted on the busiest nights of the week or whenever the noise is likely to be loudest as that is the time of greatest risk to workers and patrons. The ACGIH 8 hour Threshold Limit Value (TLV) for sound is 85 A-weighted decibel (dBA). Exposure at or below this level of sound is expected to protect most workers from noise induced hearing loss over a 40 year career. Noise induced hearing loss typically begins in the higher frequencies of 4 or 6 kHz and the progresses to the 0.5, 1, 2, and 3 kHz which are the frequencies of most conversations. ACGIH's exposure limits are recommendations based on the most current science, though OSHA's standard still allows employers to expose workers to a maximum permissible exposure level (PEL) of 90 dBA for 8 hours each day under 29 CFR 1910.95. OSHA also a 5 dBA exchange allowing this to increase to 100 dBA for 4 hours of work or decrease to 85 dBA when working a 16 hour shift. Casino workers were generally found to be exposed to an 8-hr TWAs noise level of 76.4-81.8 dBA. Another key takeaway of the noise evaluation of the casino was that the highest noise detected was in the children's arcade with levels reaching 78 – 84 dBA.\n\nThe primary risk factor for casino workers is thought to be due to second hand smoke which can increase the risk of both lung cancer and breast cancer (42% higher) above the general population's risk. In addition to second hand smoke, an increased frequency of breast cancer of 35% has also been found in women who work night shifts. Female working night shift in casinos can lower their risks of breast cancer by limiting alcohol intake, staying physically active, and maintaining a healthy weight.\n\nIn 2000, NIOSH was asked to evaluate a casino for metal dust after employees reported eye, nose, and airway irritation that they thought might be related to the process used to count metal coins. NIOSH evaluated the air and employees for nickel, copper, and zinc because these metals make up the vast majority of modern US coins. All levels were below the NIOSH recommended exposure limit (REL), specifically nickel was 7 μg/m3 (REL 15 μg/m3), copper was 24 μg/m3 (REL 1,000 μg/m3), and zinc was below the limit of detection (REL 5,000 μg/m3).\n\nMusculoskeletal injury (MSI) is a common way dealers can be injured performing their routine duties. Ergonomics tries to prevent these injuries by \"fitting the job to the worker.\" This involves educating workers about how best to safely perform their job and prevent injury as much as it does providing them with any special or protective equipment. The human body is less vulnerable to injury when in a neutral posture. Beware that your risks of overuse injury increase when there are fewer players at the table as the variation in your body motions decrease. Stretching frequently or shifting your position during breaks in the game will decrease static posture. It is worth noting that dealing different card games poses different risks: for example black jack dealers deal more cards per shift than baccarat dealers. Therefore, a safety determination for one game does not assure a similar safety profile in other similar games. Rotation of dealers between different tables allows workers to engage different muscle groups. Common postures that put dealers at risk are listed below along with how best to minimize the risk of harm:\n\nMinimize bending your wrist by flicking the cards forward using your index and middle fingers. Keep your wrists straight (do not flex or bend them). Turn to face your players or use your peripheral vision, rather than turning your head which can strain your neck.\n\nThe cards and shoe should be at or just below elbow height and adjusted so that you can keep your elbows close to your body and do not have to move your elbows out to the side to deal or shuffle. Position the shoe so that you can use it comfortably with players in your line of sight without twisting your back, wrists, or hands. Alternatively, a shoe below the table allows the dealer to rest their hands on a flat surface. Keeping your joints in as straight a line as possible will decrease overuse injuries.\nYour waist should be even with the height of the table. An adjustable height step box for dealers is more appropriate than an adjustable height table, which could put patrons at risk of an awkward posture. Alternatively, patrons could be provided with chairs that adjust in height. If possible, use a step/footrest under the table to allow you to lean forward onto the elevated leg as you reach forward. A step/footrest also allows you to change your posture regularly to avoid becoming static. If cards are beyond your reach, ask players to slide them toward you. Standing tends to decrease static posture and relieve joint pain throughout the body. However, standing also increases pressure on your feet. Therefore, it is a good idea for employers to allow employees to wear supportive footwear.\n\nAdjust the chair such that it supports your lower back and your feet are supported with your knees flexed to 90 degrees. Use a chair that swivels to turn and face the player with whom you are interacting.\n\nMake sure commonly used items are within comfortable reach. When handing out or retrieving bets move along the length of the table so that you don't have to twist or reach. Using your arm to start the wheel spinning and use a \"snap\" technique to spin the ball in the opposite direction, rather than your wrist.\n\nIf work involves lifting or moving objects, then employees should be trained in safe manual handling procedures. Be careful to avoid awkward postures when loading or unloading luggage by having your feet facing the luggage and firmly planted on the ground. It is important to shorten the distance between you and the luggage by pulling it toward you or moving toward it because the further the weight is from your body, the more strain you put on your back. Although you may not feel pain while performing the movement, you can still put your joints at risk by lifting luggage awkwardly, especially if it is heavy. Use a luggage cart whenever the luggage does not have wheels or when moving more than 2 bags. When loading a luggage cart, attempt to store larger bags upright and on the bottom and medium bags at waist height and on top. As often as possible, avoid loading any bags higher than your shoulders as our ability to lift safely decreases substantially at this height. Loading the cart in this manner will also allow you to push, rather than pull the cart and will keep your field of vision clear. Pushing will protect your back and upper extremity from injury. Remember to use both hands touching the cart slightly below elbow level and generate power to push from your legs. If your luggage cart is not functioning properly due to misaligned or malfunctioning wheels, request it be serviced because a malfunctioning cart can lead to awkward forces being applied to your body.\n\nIt is important to make sure that you can see where you are going. Push your service cart with both hands just below shoulder level, rather than pulling it behind you. If your cart is not functioning properly due to misaligned or malfunctioning wheels, request it be serviced because a malfunctioning cart can lead to awkward forces being applied to your body. Use both arms to vary and lessen the load on either arm when doing tasks such as scrubbing, folding, vacuuming, and making beds. Employers should allow employees to wear comfortable shoes to reduce strain on their back and knees. If your work requires you to kneel, cushion your knees with a mat, towel, or knee pads. Maintain a straight back when making a bed by dropping to one knee to tuck in sheets, rather than bending your back. When changing duvets or pillows, turn the covers inside out to change them, rather than stuffing them back inside. This will reduce the force applied to your arm. Use a tool with a long handle or a step stool to clean hard or awkward to reach places like bathtubs and mirrors that extend above your head. When cleaning the shower or tub, stand inside to make it easier to reach. To avoid falling, never stand on the toilet or edge of the tub as it can be slippery. Housekeepers are often expected to clean biological material (blood, vomit, excrement) and if so, workers should receive proper training and protective equipment. Housekeepers need to be alert to possible abuse by guests and casino managers need to have a plan in place to keep workers safe from guests.\n\nIf standing for a prolonged period of time use anti-fatigue matting under your feet to provide cushioning or stand with one foot elevated to shift your weight periodically from side to side (see illustration above for card dealers). Employers should allow employees to wear comfortable shoes that provide them with enough cushioning. If you are too short to comfortably see and reach over the desk, ask for a platform to stand on or an adjustable chair with a footrest that your legs can reach. Make sure that frequently used items are within easy reach and in your line of sight that avoids twisting you back or rotating your neck. The telephone and computer require continuous attention to this recommendation. A goal is to have your computer monitor at or just below eye level and your keyboard just below or even with elbow height. Do not hold the phone by pinching the telephone between your ear and shoulder, but rather hold it or ask for a lightweight headset to prevent developing neck pain.\n\nMove toward the customer or around the table if possible to refill drinks or remove plates so as to avoid straining to reach. You are at higher risk when the pitcher or plate are full as they are heavier and your arm is outstretched moving the weight away from your body. Employers should allow employees to wear comfortable shoes to reduce strain on their back and knees which can lead to injury over time. Trays should be carried with the arm in a neutral position, which is typically with your elbow bent to 90° and the palm of your hand facing upward as close to the body as possible. To bring the weight of the tray closer to your body carry the weight on both your forearm and hand, rather than just your hand alone. Avoid awkward positions that can strain your body such as carrying the tray on your finger tips or above your shoulder. To avoid awkward positions or straining muscles unnecessarily, place heavy items close to the center of the tray or closer to your body such that they are over your forearm.\n"}

It involves the gifting or exchange of Pepero snacks, a line of chocolate-dipped cookie sticks, with the intention of displaying affection for friends and loved ones. It is held on this day due to the resemblance of Pepero sticks, which are vertical that mirror the shortened date of 11/11.\n\nThe exact origins of this day are unknown. The origins are usually traced to a news story set in 1983. In the story, two female middle school students in the Yeongnam region exchanged Pepero wishing that they would both become tall and thin. However, there is some doubt about this story. Some argue that the origin was due to the shape of 1’s in the date (November 11 – 11/11) resembling Pepero sticks, while some others attribute the similarity of shapes as factors that attributed to the popularity but not its origin.\n\nThe fad spread with the idea that, for maximum effectiveness for height and thinness, one must eat 11 packets of Pepero on November 11, 11:11am and 11:11pm at 11 seconds exactly.

Since the mid-1990s she has been engaged in research on social movements related to health and public health issues with a focus on the Progressive Era.\n\nAlthough born in Pennsylvania, Engs spent her formative years in the small town of Bethel, Vermont. She went through the local schools until her junior year in high school when she went to Cushing Academy, Ashburnham, Massachusetts Upon graduation in 1957 she entered the University of Vermont and graduated in 1961 with a B.A. in Liberal Arts (chemistry major and minors in biology and English literature).\n\nAfter college graduation she worked as the laboratory assistant in the Bacteriology Department of Harvard Medical School for two years. Deciding she did not like “bench research” and having the wanderlust, in the fall of 1963 she traveled to Australia on a freighter and returned a year later to San Francisco. She had noticed on her travels that registered nurses were able to get jobs anywhere, so she entered a two-year nursing program. In the mid-1960s she married her first husband, Bill Engs, whom she had met on a backpacking trip.\n\nAfter living in the Bay Area for five years, they went to Eugene, Oregon for graduate work. Although she like nursing she found she liked teaching better. At the University of Oregon she completed two master's degrees: counseling psychology and health education. After graduation and a divorce, she taught health education and nursing courses at Dalhousie University, Halifax, Nova Scotia for a year. While there with the help of medical and nursing students, she organized the “Med-Aid Station,” a street clinic, for the many youth who were coming to Canada during this era. Realizing the need for a doctorate, she went to, and graduated from, the University of Tennessee. For her dissertation she studied the “Personality traits and the health knowledge of telephone crisis intervention volunteers in the state of Tennessee.”\n\nWhen she graduated from Tennessee, she started working as an assistant professor in the Department of Applied Health Science, Indiana University. She was tenured and promoted to associate and then full professor. She retired from teaching in 2003. During most of her first twenty years, Professor Engs explored factors for the determinants of behavior focusing upon university student drinking. This focus on alcohol originated from an invitation by the Dean of Student’s Office to develop an alcohol education program. She and her committee organized and produced the film Booz and Yous (1975) and ten years later Drinking and Thinking. She also designed and tested the Student Alcohol Questionnaire that is now used by hundreds of students and researchers each year around the world.\n\nDuring her first 20 years she published numerous papers on various aspects of college student drinking practices in the United States and many other countries. Her co-author for many was David J. Hanson, SUNY, Potsdam. She also published several textbooks including Responsible Drug and Alcohol Use (1979), Alcohol and Other Drugs: Self Responsibility (1987), and with Molly Wantz Teaching Health Education in the Elementary School (1978). She was editor for Controversies in the Addiction Field (1990) and Women: Alcohol and Other Drugs (1989). During the 1980s and early 1990s she was active on the board of directors of several national organization.\n\nBy the early-1990s Engs’ research on the determinants of drinking and health behaviors led to a different vein of research. Taking a more global look, she investigated the origins of drinking attitude and behaviors from antiquity. The resulting article was featured in \"Archeology\" (October 1997). In the United States she discovered that anti-alcohol and pro-health campaigns with moral undertones had come in cycles. This led to Clean Lean Living Movement: American Cycles of Health Reform (2000) which was featured in the \"New York Times Science Book Section\". Her next book was The Progressive Era Health Reform Movement: A Historical Dictionary (2003), followed by The Eugenics Movement: An Encyclopedia (2005), and in the fall of 2007 Conversations in the Abbey. Currently she is working on a biography of Upton Sinclair as a health reformer.\n\nEngs was awarded the School of HPER (now School of Public Health-Bloomingon), Indiana University Outstanding Researcher Award in 2002 and the Robert Kirk Distinguished Alumni Award from the University of Tennessee’s Department of Health Education, 1997.\n\nShe is an instrument rated pilot and met her husband, Jeffrey Franz, through flying in the late 1980s.

{"id": "33390780", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=33390780", "title": "Second plague pandemic", "text": "Second plague pandemic\n\nThe second plague pandemic is a major series of epidemics of the plague that started with the Black Death, which reached mainland Europe in 1348 and killed up to a half of the population of Eurasia in the next four years. Although it died out in most places, it became epizootic and recurred regularly until the nineteenth century. A series of major plagues occurred in the late 17th century and it recurred in some places until the 19th. After this a new strain of the bacterium appeared as the third pandemic.\n\nPlague is caused by the bacterium \"Yersinia pestis\" which exists in the fleas of several species in the wild and particularly rats in human society. In an outbreak it may kill all its immediate hosts and thus die out, but remain active in other hosts which it does not kill and thereby cause a new outbreak years or decades later. It has several means of transmission and infection, including rats carried on board ships or vehicles, fleas hidden in grain, and in its more virulent forms is transmitted by blood and sputum directly between humans.\n\nThere have been three major outbreaks of plague. The Plague of Justinian in the 6th and 7th centuries is the first known attack on record, and marks the first firmly recorded pattern of bubonic plague. From historical descriptions, as much as 40% of the population of Constantinople died from the plague. Modern estimates suggest half of Europe's population died as a result of the plague before it disappeared in the 700s. After 750, major epidemic diseases did not appear again in Europe until the Black Death of the 14th century.\n\nThe Second pandemic originated in or near China and was most likely spread by the Silk Road or by ship. It may have reduced world population from an estimated 450 million down to 350–375 million by the year 1400.\n\nThe plague returned at intervals with varying virulence and mortality until the early 19th century. In England, for example, the plague returned in 1360–63 killing 20% of Londoners and in 1369 killing 10–15%. In the 17th-century outbreaks were a series of \"great plagues\": the Great Plague of Seville (1647–52); the Great Plague of London (1665–66); and the Great Plague of Vienna (1679). In its virulent form, after the Great Plague of Marseille in 1720–22, the Great Plague of 1738 (which hit Eastern Europe), and the Russian plague of 1770–1772, it seems to have gradually disappeared from Europe though lingering in Egypt and the Middle East. By the early 19th century, the threat of plague had diminished, but it was quickly replaced by a new disease. The Asiatic cholera was the first of several cholera pandemics to sweep through Asia and Europe during the 19th and 20th centuries.\n\nThe Third Pandemic hit China in the 1890s and devastated India, but was largely contained in the east, though becoming endemic in the Western United States. It still causes sporadic outbreaks.\n\nArab historians Ibn Al-Wardni and Almaqrizi believed the Black Death originated in Mongolia, and Chinese records show a huge outbreak in Mongolia in the early 1330s. Europe was initially protected by a hiatus in the Silk Road, but a 1347 Mongolian siege at Caffa—the last Italian outpost on the Crimean Peninsula—spread it to the defenders, who carried it back with them that winter. It arrived at Genoa and Venice in January 1348, while simultaneously spreading through Asia Minor and into Egypt. The bubonic form was described graphically in Florence in \"The Decameron\" and Guy de Chauliac also described the pneumonic form at Avignon. It rapidly spread to France and Spain, by 1349 was in England, in 1350 was afflicting eastern Europe and it reached the centre of Russia by 1351. In most parts it blew itself out within about three years, though only temporarily.\n\nThe 14th-century eruption of the Black Death had a drastic effect on Europe's population, irrevocably changing the social structure, and resulted in widespread persecution of minorities such as Jews, foreigners, beggars, and lepers (see Persecutions). The uncertainty of daily survival has been seen as creating a general mood of morbidity, influencing people to \"live for the moment,\" as illustrated by Giovanni Boccaccio in \"The Decameron\" (1353).\n\nThere were large epidemics in China in 1331 and 1351-54 in Hopei, Shansi and other provinces which are considered to have killed between 50% and 90% of the local populations, running into tens of millions. However, there is no proof currently that these were caused by plague though there are indications for the second set of epidemics.\n\nThe plague repeatedly returned to haunt Europe and the Mediterranean throughout the 14th to 17th centuries. According to Biraben, plague was present somewhere in Europe in every year between 1346 and 1671. Subsequent outbreaks, though severe, marked the retreat from most of Europe (18th century) and northern Africa (19th century). According to Geoffrey Parker, \"France alone lost almost a million people to plague in the epidemic of 1628–31.\"\n\nIn 1466, perhaps 40,000 people died of plague in Paris. During the 16th and 17th centuries, plague visited Paris for almost one year out of three. The Black Death ravaged Europe for three years before it continued on into Russia, where the disease hit somewhere once every five or six years from 1350 to 1490. Plague epidemics ravaged London in 1563, 1593, 1603, 1625, 1636, and 1665, reducing its population by 10 to 30% during those years. Over 10% of Amsterdam's population died in 1623–1625, and again in 1635–1636, 1655, and 1664. There were 22 outbreaks of plague in Venice between 1361 and 1528. The plague of 1576–1577 killed 50,000 in Venice, almost a third of the population. Late outbreaks in central Europe included the Italian Plague of 1629–1631, which is associated with troop movements during the Thirty Years' War, and the Great Plague of Vienna in 1679. Over 60% of Norway's population died from 1348 to 1350. The last plague outbreak ravaged Oslo in 1654.\n\nIn the first half of the 17th century, a plague claimed some 1.7 million victims in Italy, or about 14% of the population. In 1654, the Russian plague killed about 700,000 inhabitants. In 1656, the plague killed about half of Naples' 300,000 inhabitants. More than 1.25 million deaths resulted from the extreme incidence of plague in 17th-century Spain. The plague of 1649 probably reduced the population of Seville by half. In 1709–1713, a plague epidemic that followed the Great Northern War (1700–1721, Sweden v. Russia and allies) killed about 100,000 in Sweden, and 300,000 in Prussia. The plague killed two-thirds of the inhabitants of Helsinki, and claimed a third of Stockholm's population. Western Europe's last major epidemic occurred in 1720 in Marseilles, in Central Europe the last major outbreaks happened during the plague during the Great Northern War, and in Eastern Europe during the Russian plague of 1770-1772\nThe plague ravaged much of the Islamic world. Plague was present in at least one location in the Islamic world virtually every year between 1500 and 1850. Plague repeatedly struck the cities of North Africa. Algiers lost 30,000–50,000 to it in 1620–21, and again in 1654–57, 1665, 1691, and 1740–42. Plague remained a major event in Ottoman society until the second quarter of the 19th century. Between 1701 and 1750, 37 larger and smaller epidemics were recorded in Constantinople, and 31 between 1751 and 1800. Baghdad has suffered severely from visitations of the plague, and sometimes two-thirds of its population has been wiped out.\n\nThe second pandemic never became endemic in Europe. Most epidemics arrived with shipping from the near east and died out after a few years. But the pandemic died out progressively across Europe. One documented case was in 17th century London, where the first proper demographer, John Graunt, failed by just 5 years to see the last recorded death from plague, which happened in 1679, 14 years after the Great Plague of London. The reasons it died out totally are not well understood. It is tempting to think that the Great Fire of London the next year destroyed the hiding places of the rats in the roofs. Certainly there isn't a single plague death recorded \"within the walls\" after 1666. However the city by this time had spread well beyond the walls which contained most of the fire and most of plague cases happened beyond the limits of the fire. Probably more significant was the fact that all buildings after the fire were constructed of brick rather than wood and other flammable materials.\n\nThis pattern was broadly followed after major epidemics in northern Italy (1631), south and east Spain (1652), southern Italy and Genoa (1657), Paris (1668).\n\nAppleby considers six possible explanations:\n\nIt has been suggested that evolutionary processes may have favored less virulent strains of the pathogen \"Yersinia pestis\".\n\nProbably most of these have some weight, but the answer is unclear.\n\nThe disappearance happened rather later in the Nordic and eastern European countries but there was a similar halt after major epidemics.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "6665283", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=6665283", "title": "Shifting baseline", "text": "Shifting baseline\n\nA shifting baseline (also known as sliding baseline) is a type of change to how a system is measured, usually against previous reference points (baselines), which themselves may represent significant changes from an even earlier state of the system. \n\nThe concept arose in landscape architect Ian McHarg's 1969 manifesto \"Design With Nature\" in which the modern landscape is compared to that on which ancient people once lived. The concept was then considered by the fisheries scientist Daniel Pauly in his paper \"Anecdotes and the shifting baseline syndrome of fisheries\". Pauly developed the concept in reference to fisheries management where fisheries scientists sometimes fail to identify the correct \"baseline\" population size (e.g. how abundant a fish species population was \"before\" human exploitation) and thus work with a shifted baseline. He describes the way that radically depleted fisheries were evaluated by experts who used the state of the fishery at the start of their careers as the baseline, rather than the fishery in its untouched state. Areas that swarmed with a particular species hundreds of years ago, may have experienced long term decline, but it is the level of decades previously that is considered the appropriate reference point for current populations. In this way large declines in ecosystems or species over long periods of time were, and are, masked. There is a loss of perception of change that occurs when each generation redefines what is \"natural\". \n\nMost modern fisheries stock assessments do not ignore historical fishing and account for it by either including the historical catch or use other techniques to reconstruct the depletion level of the population at the start of the period for which adequate data is available. Anecdotes about historical populations levels can be highly unreliable and result in severe mismanagement of the fishery.\n\nThe concept was further refined and applied to the ecology of kelp forests by Paul Dayton and others from the Scripps Institution of Oceanography. They used a slightly different version of the term in their paper, \"Sliding baselines, ghosts, and reduced expectations in kelp forest communities\". Both terms refer to a shift over time in the expectation of what a healthy ecosystem baseline looks like.\n\nIn 2002, filmmaker and former marine biologist Randy Olson broadened the definition of shifting baselines with an op-ed in the \"Los Angeles Times\". He explained the relevance of the concept to all aspects of change and the failure to notice change in the world today. He and coral reef ecologist Jeremy Jackson (of Scripps Institution of Oceanography) co-founded \"The Shifting Baselines Ocean Media Project\" in 2003 to help promote a wider understanding and use of the concept in conservation policy.\n\nThe Shifting Baselines Ocean Media Project grew from its three founding partners (Scripps Institution of Oceanography, The Ocean Conservancy, and Surfrider Foundation) to over twenty conservation groups and science organizations. The project has produced dozens of short films, public service announcements, and Flash videos along with photography, video, and stand-up comedy contests, all intended to promote the term to a broader audience. The Shifting Baselines Blog, \"the cure for planetary amnesia\" is run by the Shifting Baselines Ocean Media Project on the Seed (magazine) Science Blogs.\n\n\n\n"}

He created seminal pieces of work in impression formation, prestige suggestion, conformity, and many other topics in social psychology. His work follows a common theme of Gestalt psychology that the whole is not only greater than the sum of its parts, but the nature of the whole fundamentally alters the parts. Asch stated: \"Most social acts have to be understood in their setting, and lose meaning if isolated. No error in thinking about social facts is more serious than the failure to see their place and function\" (Asch, 1952, p. 61). He is most well known for his conformity experiments, in which he demonstrated the influence of group pressure on opinions. A \"Review of General Psychology\" survey, published in 2002, ranked Asch as the 41st most cited psychologist of the 20th century.\n\nAsch was born in Warsaw, Poland on September 14, 1907 to a Jewish family. He grew up in a small town, Łowicz, Poland.\n\nIn 1920 Asch emigrated at the age of 13 with his family to the United States. They lived on the Lower East Side of New York, a dense area of many Jewish, Italian and Irish immigrants. His friends called him Shlaym.\n\nAsch was shy when he moved to the United States and did not speak English fluently due to being brought up in Poland. He went to the neighborhood public school, P.S. 147, to attend 6th grade. As a result of the language barrier, Asch had a very difficult time understanding in class. He learned English by reading Charles Dickens. Asch later attended Townsend Harris High School, a very selective high school attached to the City College of New York. After high school, he attended the City College of New York, majoring in both literature and science. He became interested in psychology towards the end of his undergraduate career after reading the work of William James and a few philosophers. In 1928, when he was 21 years old, he received his Bachelor of Science.\n\nAsch went on to pursue his graduate degree at Columbia University. He initially was interested in anthropology, not in social psychology. With the help of Gardner Murphy, Lois Murphy, Franz Boas, and Ruth Benedict he gained a summer fellowship and investigated how children become members of their culture. His master's thesis was a statistical analysis of the test scores of 200 children under the supervision of Woodworth. Asch received his master's degree in 1930. His doctoral dissertation examined whether all learning curves have the same form; H.E. Garrett assigned the topic to him. He received his PhD in 1932.\n\nAsch was exposed to Gestalt psychology through Gardner Murphy, then a young faculty member at Columbia. He became much more interested in Gestalt psychology after meeting and working closely with his adviser at Columbia, Max Wertheimer, one of the founders of Gestalt psychology. Asch later became close friend with Wertheimer.\n\nAsch met Florence Miller in a library on East Broadway on the lower East Side in New York City. He married her in 1930. Their relationship was reported as being \"easy, good-humored\" (Rock, pg. 5). Asch remained married to Florence his entire life. They had their first and only son, Peter, in 1937. Peter Asch became a Professor of Economics at Rutgers University, married Ruth Zindler and had two sons, Eric and David. Peter died of heart failure at age 52 (predeceasing both parents and his wife.)\n\nAsch began his teaching career at Brooklyn College. In 1947, he moved to Swarthmore College, where he stayed for 19 years (1947-1966). Swarthmore was the major center for scholars of Gestalt psychology at that time in the United States. Wolfgang Kohler, a German immigrant; W. C. H. Prentice, and Hans Wallach were faculty members at that time as well.\n\nIn 1966, Asch left to found the Institute for Cognitive Studies at Rutgers University (1966-1972). In 1972, Asch moved to the University of Pennsylvania. He taught there as a professor of psychology until he retired in 1979, and was Emeritus until 1996. Asch also had visiting posts at Harvard and MIT.\n\nAsch was interested in how humans form impressions of other human beings. He was intrigued how we are able to easily form impressions of humans even though we have such complex structures. He specifically was interested in how impressions of other people were established and if there were any principles that regulated these impressions. Asch concluded \"to know a person is to have a grasp of a particular structure\". He demonstrated through his experiments that forming an impression has the following elements:\n\nAsch conducted many experiments in which he asked participants to form an impression of a hypothetical person based on several characteristics said to belong to them.\n\nCentral characteristics on impression formation\nIn one experiment, two groups, A and B, were exposed to a list of exactly the same characteristics except one, cold vs. warm. The list of characteristics given to each group are listed below:\n\nGroup A: intelligent-skillful-industrious-\"warm\"-determined-practical-cautious\n\nGroup B: intelligent-skillful-industrious-\"cold\"-determined-practical-cautious\n\nOne group of people were told that the person was \"warm\" and another group of people were told the person is \"cold\". Participants were asked to write a brief description of the impression they formed after hearing these characteristics. The experimenters also produced a check list consisting of pairs of opposite traits, such as generous/ungenerous, shrewd/wise, etc. These words were related to the first list of characteristics they heard. Participants were asked to indicate which of these traits matched with the hypothetical person who had just been described to them.\n\nAsch found that very different impressions were found based on this one characteristic in the list. In general, the \"A\" impressions were far more positive than the \"B\" impressions. Based on the results of the written descriptions of the hypothetical person, the meaning of the other characteristics in the list seemed to change, related to whether the hypothetical person was described as a \"warm\" or \"cold\" person.\n\nNot all qualities were changed by this word. Words such as \"honest\", \"strong\", \"serious\", and \"reliable\" were not affected. The words \"warm\" and \"cold\" were shown to be of more importance in forming participant's impressions than other characteristics. They were considered to be basic to understanding the person, whereas other characteristics would be considered secondary. Thus, if another characteristic in this list was changed between two subjects, such as manipulating the words \"polite\" and \"blunt\", instead of the words \"warm\" and \"cold\", it would not affect the impression of the person as much as did \"warm\" and \"cold\". Asch called \"warm\" and \"cold\" \"central\" characteristics, and \"polite\" and \"blunt\" peripheral characteristics.\n\nOrder effects on impression formation\n\nIn another experiment, Asch found that the order in which he presented the traits of a hypothetical person drastically influenced the impression formed by participants formed. For example, participants were read one of the following lists below:\n\nA. intelligent-industrious-impulsive-critical-stubborn-envious\n\nB. envious-stubborn-critical-impulsive-industrious-intelligent\n\nSeries A starts with desirable qualities and ends with undesirable qualities, while the reverse is true for Series B. As a result of this slight difference, people perceive person A as someone who is an \"able person who possesses certain shortcomings which, do not, however, overshadow his merits\". But, people perceive person B as a \"problem, whose abilities are hampered by his serious difficulties\". The meaning of the other words in this list also change in the majority of subjects between list A and list B. Words such as \"impulsive\" and \"critical\" take on a positive meaning with A, but a negative meaning with B.\n\nSimilarity and difference of impression\n\nIn another central experiment, Asch presented participants with four groups of characteristics. Each participant was exposed to the group of words listed below.\n\nSet 1: Quick, Skillful, Helpful\n\nSet 2: Quick, Clumsy, Helpful\n\nSet 3: Slow, Skillful, Helpful\n\nSet 4: Slow, Clumsy, Helpful\n\nNotice that only one characteristic, \"helpful\", is the same throughout all of the four sets. Participants were asked 1) which of the other three sets most resemble Set I, and 2) which of the other sets most resembles Set 2. In 87 percent of the cases, Set 1 was seen most similar with Set 3. In only 13 percent of the cases, people reported Set 1 to be similar to Set 2. Also, Set 2 was said to resemble Set 4 in 85 percent of the cases and only 9 percent of the cases was it said to resemble Set I was the closest.\n\nHowever, there are more \"identical elements\" in Set 1 and 2 and in Set 3 and 4. Notice that two of the three words are the same in Set 1 and 2 and in Set 3 and 4. The similarity in sets can not be based on the number of shared elements in the set. Participants also reported that the word \"quick\" of set 1 was most similar in meaning to \"slow\" of set 3. Similarly, \"quick\" of set 2 was perceived to be most similar in meaning to \"slow\" of set 4.\n\nAsch reached the following conclusions based on this experiment:\n\n1)The meaning of a characteristic changes based on a change in the \"environment\" it's in. Thus, the meanings of the words \"quick\" and \"slow\" change based on what other words it is presented with or associated with in real life. The meaning of the word \"quick\" in set 1 is associated more with \"one of assurance, of smoothness of movement\" while in set 2 the word is associated with \"forced quickness, in an effort to be helpful\". In everyday life, we perceive a quick, skillful person to be very different from a quick, clumsy person. However, we perceive someone who is \"quick and skillful\" and \"slow and skillful\" as being similar and sharing the same quality of being more of an expert.\n\n2) The change in the meaning of the characteristic is determined by its relationship with other characteristics. \"[Set] I is quick because he is skillful; [Set] 2 is clumsy because he is fast\"\n\"In [Set] 3 slowness indicates care, prides in work well-done. Slowness in [Set] 4 indicates sluggishness, poor motor coordinate, some physical retardation\" We perceive our overall impression by integrating the relationships of the different qualities of a person. Therefore, we form very different impressions when one of these qualities differ.\n\n3) \"Dynamic consequences are grasped in the interaction of qualities\", (Asch, pg. 280). Participants considered \"quick\" and \"skillful\" and \"slow\" and \"skillful\" as characteristics that cooperate together, but they think of \"quick\" and \"clumsy\" as characteristics that cancel one another.\n\nAs a result of World War II in the 1940s, Asch and other social psychologists were interested in propaganda. They wondered: How do you get people to believe what you want them to believe? How do you get people to believe they should sacrifice for the war effort? \n\nIn everyday life, psychologists noticed that people are persuaded by messages differently based on the identity of the author. It seemed that the more prestige the author/speaker has, the more likely the person will believe them. Many social psychologists prior to Asch had studied this phenomenon. However, Asch disagreed with many of them and critiqued their interpretations. His main conclusion was that a change in evaluation requires a change in the content and meaning of the response as a result of the change in context. Therefore, the meaning of the message is interpreted differently depending on who is the author of the message. He suggests that participants are not blindly accepting a message based on the author, but rather they are making meaning of the quote based on the author.\n\nAsch called into question the present theory for the underlying psychological process concerning the effect of group forces on the formation and change of opinions and attitudes. \nAsch critiques the experimental approach of many different psychologists, including Zillig, Moore, Marple, Sherif, Thorndike, and Lorge, in their investigations of evaluation change. Lorge's and Sherif's investigation of the effects of \"prestige\" on the evaluation of statements were investigated in detail in one of Asch's articles.\n\nThe same basic procedure was used by all of the above-mentioned psychologists. A participant makes a judgment about some particular issue. At a later time, they judge the same problem again but with information of how certain groups or prestigious people have evaluated the same problem. If the subject changes his judgment in the same direction as the evaluations of these groups of people or prestigious people, then this is considered a degree of influence that they have exerted on the participant's judgment.\n\nLorge critique\n\nLorge's main finding was that \"prestige\" can alter evaluations of statements of serious political and economic questions.\n\nIn his experiment, subjects rated a set of 50 quotations on a 5-point scale of \"agreement\" or \"disagreement\" with the statement. The quotes were followed by the names of two public people. Subjects were informed that one of the names was the author of the true source and were asked to select the true author. After about a month, the subjects again rated the same quotation but with the true author only listed below the quotation. Subjects also rated earlier their \"respect for the political opinions of each of these individuals\". This was used as a measure of prestige. Lorge found that the participants rated the same statement differently when it was referred to a different author. More specifically, the rating of a statement tended to rise when it was referred to a more \"prestigious\" author.\n\nOne of Lorge's main conclusions is that \"an unchanged object of judgment undergoes a change of evaluation\". Therefore, the prestige of the author is viewed as acting arbitrarily on the statement regardless of the content or merit of the statement. Participants simply view the statement as having higher value when the author has higher prestige.\n\nAsch, however, reinterprets Lorge's findings and suggests that there was \"a change in the object of judgment, rather than in the judgment of the object\" (Asch, 1940). He suggests that a person will redefine the object of judgment based on the content of the evaluations. Therefore, the person will base the meaning of the quote in the context of what he/she believes to be true about the person who said the quote, resulting in different meanings of the statements based on the author.\n\nIn evidence of his claims, Asch conducted an experiment in which college students read statements with the name of one author below each statement. They were instructed to describe what the statement meant to them. Two groups of students read the same statements but with different authors associated with them. The main finding was that there was a \"cognitive reorganization\" of the statement based on what was understood about the author of the statement. Participant's felt the meaning of the quote differed depending on who wrote the statement.\n\nFor example, the following quote was presented to both groups of subjects: \"Only the willfully blind can fail to see that the old style capitalism of a primitive freebooting period is gone forever. The capitalism of complete laissez-faire, which thrived on low wages and maximum profits for minimum turnover, which rejected collective bargaining and fought against justified public regulation of the competitive process, is a thing of the past.\" When participants thought that Bridges (a well-known union leader) was the author, they interpreted the passage to be an \"expression of the accomplishments of labor in the face of opposition from capital and contained a resolve to defend these gains from attack\". However, when Johnston (president of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce at the time) was the author, they interpreted the passage to be \"a perspective of policy in the interest of business, especially of 'enlightened' business\". Asch conducted a very similar and classic study with participants reading statements either attributed to Jefferson or Lenin.\n\nOne of the major points that Asch makes is that participants are not completely blind in the experiment and making arbitrary choices based on this bias. Asch claims that participants were acting reasonable in their change of evaluation of the judgment because the context of the judgment and thus the meaning of the judgment had changed. Lorge, however, suggested that if the participants were behaving logical, their evaluations should have remained the same despite the change in author.\n\nSherif critique\n\nMuzafer Sherif conducted an experiment, very similar to Lorge, in which he investigated how prestige affects the evaluation of literary materials. College students were asked to rank a set of prose passages according to their literary quality. Each passage also included the name of a well-known author. However, all of the passages were actually written by the same author. Participants rated the authors earlier in terms of their literary standing. Sherif found that passages that were identified with highly acclaimed authors received higher rankings.\n\nAsch suggested that Sherif's results could be largely influenced from the environment of a laboratory experiment. Because the experiment was designed to have each of the passages have very few differences between them, participants were faced with a dilemma when asked to distinguish between them. The experimenter and other neighboring participants may appear to find the task obvious, so the participant attends to any clues that might help him make the decision. In fear of looking ridiculous, the participant might now approach the task as, \"Which of these am I expected to like and dislike?\" With the only information that varies being the author, the participant might make conclusions about the quotes based on this one piece of information that varies.\n\nAsch is best known for his conformity experiments. His main finding was that peer pressure can change opinion and even perception.\n\nAsch asked: 1) To what extent do social forces alter people's opinions? 2) Which aspect of the group influence is most important–the size of the majority or unanimity of opinion?\n\nAsch's conformity experiment was conducted using 123 male participants who were told that they would be part of an experiment in visual judgment. Each subject was put into a group with 5 to 7 confederates (people who knew the true aims of the experiment, but were introduced as participants to the naive \"real\" participant). The group was shown a card with a line on it, followed by another card with 3 lines on it labeled a, b, and c. The participants were then asked to say which line matched in length the line on the first card. Each line question was called a \"trial\". The \"real\" participant answered last or penultimately. For the first two trials, the subject would feel at ease in the experiment, as he and the other \"participants\" gave the obvious, correct answer. However, after the fourth trial, all of the confederates respond with the clearly wrong answer at certain points such that in 12 of the 18 trials they all gave the wrong answer. The 12 trials in which the confederates answered incorrectly were the \"critical trials\". The participant could thus either ignore the majority and go with his own senses or he could go along with the majority and ignore the clearly obvious fact. The aim was to see whether the real participant would change his answer and respond the same way as the confederates or stick with what his eyes plainly told him.\n\nAsch found that some 1/4 of all subjects successfully withstands this form of social pressure, 1/20 completely succumbs, while the remainder conforms to the majority's manifestly incorrect opinion only in some experimental rounds. Asch suggested that this procedure created a doubt in the participants' mind about the seemingly obvious answer. Participants reported that the correct but rejected line was almost but not quite equal to the standard line. Asch also found that the effectiveness of the group pressure increased significantly from 1 person to 3 people unanimously responding incorrectly. However, there was not much increase after that. He also found that when one confederate responded correctly, the power of the majority to influence the subject decreased substantially.\n\nAsch told his colleagues that his studies of conformity were informed by his childhood experiences in Poland. He recalled being seven years old and staying up for his first Passover night. He recalls seeing his grandmother pour an extra glass of wine. When he asked who the glass of wine was for, she said that it was for the prophet Elijah. He then asked her whether Elijah would really take a sip from the glass and his uncle assured him that he would. His uncle told him to watch very closely when the time came. \"Filled with a sense of suggestion and expectation\" Asch \"thought he saw the level of wine in the cup drop just a bit\". Thus, early in life, Asch succumbed to social pressure, an experience which led him to investigate conformity later in life.\n\nMetaphors\n\nAsch looked at metaphors in a variety of different languages, such as Old Testament Hebrew, Homeric Greek, Chinese, Thai, Malayam, and Hausa. He found that there was a similar meaning for the sensory term, such as \"cold\" in English, and the corresponding personality trait. He concluded that metaphors, and thus language, reflects a person's attempt to understand the true properties of a person or object.\n\nUnitary and nonunitary associations\n\nAsch showed that simple properties would enter into associations much easier when they are part of the same unit than when they are from different units.\n\nAsch was Stanley Milgram's advisor at Princeton University, and Milgram completed his dissertation on national differences under conformity under Asch. Asch also largely influenced the theory of many other social psychologists, such as Harold Kelley.\n\nAccording to Levine (1999), Asch's research has led to four critical ideas that persist in social influence research. First, Asch believed that social interaction reflects the ability of individual people to synthesize information about group norms, the viewpoints of others and their own perceptions of themselves as group members. This point of view has been manifested in at least two important theories (social identity theory and self-categorization theory), and has been a source of inspiration for the work of many social psychologists (See Hardin & Higgins, 1996; Weick & Roberts, 1993).\n\nSecond, Asch emphasized that independent thought and disagreement among group members is a cornerstone of group functioning. He believed that only by settling our differences with other group members can we actually understand the shortcomings of our own beliefs (Levine, 1999). This notion has been embraced by social scientists like Moscovici, who has pursued this rationale as the basis for his theory of minority influence in group situations, and has also been incorporated into sociocognitive conflict theory.\n\nAsch also believed the relationship between conformity and non-conformity was not as simple as one being the opposite of the other. This was Asch's third influential idea, and he suggested that conformity and resistance might be explained by their own unique social psychological processes. Conformity, for instance, could be a function of how aware a person is that they are being influenced by the group (distortion of perception), the degree to which the person believes that the group consensus is correct (distortion of judgement), and how badly the person wants to be accepted by the group (distortion of action). Although these exact terms have not been directly ported over to the literature, researchers such as Moscovici and Nemeth have adopted the perspective that majority and minority influence are moderated by multiple processes (Levine, 1999).\n\nLastly, Asch suggested that group influence can change how people perceive stimuli (See Asch, 1940 for an example). This is the most obscure of Asch's major ideas, in large part because it has not been cited frequently (Levine, 1999), but is none-the-less important because it speaks to the power of group influence.\n\nIn the 1980s, Asch was disappointed and concerned by the direction social psychology was taking. He wrote, \"Why do I sense, together with the current expansion, a shrinking of vision, an expansion of surface rather than depth, a failure of imagination?...Why is not social psychology more exciting, more human in the most usual sense of that term? To sum up, is this discipline perhaps on the wrong track?\" (Asch, p. x) Asch was worried that social psychologists were not asking the deeper questions that would help change and improve the world.\n\nAsch died at the age of 88 on February 20, 1996 in his home in Haverford, Pennsylvania.\n\n\n"}

He that loveth his life shall lose it; and he that hateth his life in this world shall keep it unto life eternal. If any man serve me, let him follow me; and where I am, there shall also my servant be: if any man serve me, him will my Father honour.\nFrom the NIV:Very truly I tell you, unless a kernel of wheat falls to the ground and dies, it remains only a single seed. But if it dies, it produces many seeds. Anyone who loves their life will lose it, while anyone who hates their life in this world will keep it for eternal life. Whoever serves me must follow me; and where I am, my servant also will be. My Father will honour the one who serves me.\n\nJesus drew this parable about resurrection and the kingdom of God from the everyday circumstances of life. His rural audience could easily understand the principle of \"resurrection\" produced by dead seeds sown into the earth. Jesus uses the metaphor of the grain of wheat to illustrate the importance of ego death in the pursuit of salvation and entering the Kingdom of Heaven. He is suggesting that one must first allow their current convictions and ideas about the world to die and be shed, before they can be reborn with a purer, more virtuous self that is stronger than the original.\n\nThe image of the grain of wheat dying in the earth in order to grow and bear a harvest can be seen also as a metaphor of Jesus' own death and burial in the tomb and his resurrection. \n\nThe Rev. William D. Oldland in his sermon \"Unless a Grain of Wheat Falls into the Earth and Dies\" said:\n\nThe Apostle Paul also says: \"What is sown in the earth is subject to decay, what rises is incorruptible\" (1 Cor. 15:42).\n\n"}
{"id": "2555114", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2555114", "title": "USMLE Step 1", "text": "USMLE Step 1\n\nThe USMLE Step 1 (more commonly just Step 1 or colloquially, The Boards) is the first part of the United States Medical Licensing Examination. It aims to assess whether medical school students or graduates can apply important concepts of the foundational sciences fundamental to the practice of medicine. US medical students who wish to seek licensure to practice medicine in the US, typically take Step 1 at the end of the second year of medical school. Graduates of international medical schools (i.e., those outside the US or Canada) must also take Step 1 if they want to practice in the US. Graduates from international medical schools must apply through ECFMG, and the registration fee is $915. For 2016, the NBME registration fee for the test is $600, with additional charges for applicants who choose a testing region outside the United States or Canada.\n\nPrior to 1992, the NBME Part I examination served as the staple basic science examination for medical students at the end of their second year. Upon the launch of the three-part United States Medical Licensing Examination, NBME Part I exam was carried forward in its new format, the USMLE Step 1 examination, which has since evolved to become an increasingly clinically-applied examination of the foundational sciences. The exam became computer based several years later. In May 2015, the USMLE began emphasizing of concepts regarding patient safety and quality improvement across all parts of the USMLE exam series, including Step 1.\n\nWhile the USMLE Step 1 has traditionally been taken after students complete foundational sciences and before core clinical clerkships, in recent years a number of medical schools have reformed their medical school curriculum, moving to having students take the USMLE Step 1 \"after\" core clinical clerkships or preliminary clinical training. Top allopathic medical schools such as Harvard Medical School, Baylor College of Medicine, Weill Cornell Medical College, Perelman School of Medicine at the University of Pennsylvania, Vagelos College of Physicians and Surgeons at Columbia University, Stanford School of Medicine, University of Michigan, Yale School of Medicine, and New York University School of Medicine have instituted these changes, requiring completion of the exam in the third year of medical school. \n\nThe exam is currently an eight-hour computer-based test taken in a single-day, composed of seven 40-question sections with a maximum 280 multiple-choice questions. One hour is provided for each section, allotting an average of a minute and thirty seconds to answer each question. Between test sections, the test taker is allotted a cumulative 45 minutes (during the test day) for personal breaks. (There is a 15-minute tutorial at the beginning of the exam, which the test-taker can choose to skip and have that time added to break time.) If the taker finishes any section before the allotted one hour time limit, the unused time is added to the break time total. The test is administered at any of several Prometric computer testing sites.\n\nStep 1 is designed to test the knowledge learned during the basic science years of medical school as applied in the form of clinical vignettes. This includes anatomy, behavioral sciences, biochemistry, microbiology, pathology, pharmacology, and physiology, as well as to interdisciplinary areas including genetics, aging, immunology, nutrition, and molecular and cell biology. Epidemiology, medical ethics and questions on empathy are also emphasized. Each exam is dynamically generated for each test taker; while the general proportion of questions derived from a particular subject is the same, some test takers report that certain subjects are either emphasized or deemphasized.\n\nCurrently, students receive a three-digit score following sitting for the Step 1 examination. In 1999, the USMLE phased out the use of a percentile-based system in favor of a three-digit and two-digit scaled scoring system. In October 2011, two-digit scaled scores were no longer reported to any parties besides the examinees. In April 2013, the two-digit score was eliminated completely from the score report.\n\nWhile the USMLE program does not disclose how the three-digit score is calculated, Step 1 scores theoretically range from 1 to 300, most examinees score in the range of 140 to 260, the passing score is 194 and the national mean and standard deviation are approximately 229 and 20, respectively. Rise in the national mean Step 1 score has been observed with time, as shown in the table below. According to the National Resident Matching Program, the mean score for U.S. allopathic seniors who matched to residency programs in 2016 was 233.2 (sd = 17.4).\n\nThe USMLE score is one of many factors considered by residency programs in selecting applicants. However, at present, this test is the \"only\" standardized measure of all applicants. The median USMLE Step 1 scores for graduates of U.S. Medical Schools for various residencies are charted in Chart 6 on page 9 of \"Charting Outcomes in the Match\" available through NRMP Website\n\nMany residency programs use a \"cutoff\" score for Step 1, below which applicants are unlikely to be considered, although in some cases individuals with significantly higher Step 2 CK scores may still receive further consideration. The NRMP Residency Program Director survey contains more information, both overall and by specialty, regarding \"cutoff\" scores (i.e., scores below which programs generally do not grant interviews).\n\n\n"}

Almost 1 in 4 adults in England are currently obese, and if this pattern were to continue in this current manner 9 in 10 adults will be overweight or obese by 2050. One of the key reasons for this is that more than 85% of the adult population, either can't, won't or don't visit a gym or health club in order to participate in regular exercise. The typical barrier reasons to participation are personal reasons such as privacy, self-consciousness, intimidation, cost, flexibility and geography. The \"delivery solution\" from VirtualGym TV is designed to permit on-demand access to exercise to eliminate these participation barriers.\n\nThe company reached out to an audience of in excess of 130,000 retail and corporate users.\n\nThe idea was founded when the now Managing Director, Richard Davis (who found himself clinically obese), was having a conversation with a high level instructor colleague, where at the time, the only real options were to either create a Fitness DVD and distribute it in the normal way, or to broadcast on the television. Coming from a background in Employee Benefits (selling insurance to suckers), Davis developed what is primarily a corporate benefit for large scale, fragmented workforces, but is accessible by the wider genera public as well.\n\nThe company had continued to grow and by the summer of 2008 it formed a strategic alliance with the major sportswear manufacturer, Asics. More recently, they had achieved approval from the Department of Health and are a delivery partner of the Change4Life and MoreActive4Life social obesity campaigns (NHS) before they closed down. They also worked in partnership with their alcohol limits campaign, and the business awareness campaign with the FIA (Fitness Industry Association).\n\nThe core of the product was powered by the 'Virtual Personal Trainer' (VPT) software which was a bespoke facility. The software captured a broad range of physiological and psychological data, which was analysed by the VPT software and appropriate exercise recommendations were prescribed specifically tailored for the individual. The VPT would specifically recommend which sessions the customer should participate in, the frequency with which they should participate and the intensity level that was right for them. The user would then participate in regular exercise from their ever-changing library of exercise content across all exercise areas. This ranged from Aerobics through to Pilates, Stability Ball and very specific pre & post natal content.\n\nIt was rumoured that the launch of 'Virtual Personal Trainer 2' (VPT2) software, early in 2010, would see the introduction of new features to increase the accuracy of customers own fitness program, the capturing of live physiological data during exercise, as well as a number of downloadable software applications for mobile handset devices. How sad, it never worked!\n\nEach week no new classes classes are uploaded to the site. The bank of classes and tuition classes are no longer delivered through the internet to any past clients. Typical classes used to include Aerobics, Step Aerobics, Boxercise, Kick Boxing, Yoga, Pilates, T'ai chi, Body Conditioning, Circuit Training, Body Sculpting, Medicine Ball, Dance, Stationary (Spin) Bicycle, Treadmill, Interval Training, and various Martial Arts training sessions, (including meditation / relaxation).\n\nClasses were scheduled in a similar fashion to a traditional gym, with shorter energising sessions in the morning and longer sessions in the afternoon and evening, which last between 45 and 60 minutes before going off to the pub. Sessions were broadcast across a range of ability standards, so that customers could have chosen the appropriate complexity and fitness demand that was relevant for them. Customers could also learn a new fitness skill from scratch, with “starter” teaching sessions for those who have never participated in that exercise type before.\n\nInstructors are accredited with the Register of Exercise Professions (REPS), the governing body for the health and fitness industry, and the National Register of Personal Trainers. They are qualified to a minimum level by the relevant professional organisation. Instructors include Pierre Pozzuto, personal trainer of Gordon Ramsay, Christian Slater and Keira Knightley. Other well known instructors include Dan Little, Jackie Diss and Chris Roberts.\n"}

The plan was endorsed by the Sixtieth World Health Assembly on May 23, 2007 because of several concerns. First, workers represent a significant contribution to the world's economic and social development. Furthermore, an international disparity between countries of occupational hazard prevention and access to occupational health services was observed. As such, the plan is grounded on both humanitarian and economically practical grounds.\n\nThe plan of action deals with all aspects of workers' health, including primary prevention of occupational hazards, protection and promotion of health at work, employment conditions, and a better response from health systems to workers' health. It is underpinned by certain common principles. All workers should be able to enjoy the highest attainable standard of physical and mental health and favorable working conditions. The workplace should not be detrimental to health and well-being. Primary prevention of occupational health hazards should be given priority. All components of health systems should be involved in an integrated response to the specific health needs of working populations.\n\nThe plan lists several actions for the \"member states\" that adopt it.\n\nCountries and member states should formulate their national policy frameworks to promote workers' health, strengthening their ministries of health, and integrating workers' health concerns into national health strategies. They also need to minimize the gaps between different groups of workers in terms of levels of risk and health status. High-risk economic sectors and vulnerable working populations, such as younger and older workers, need special consideration and protection.\n\nMember states should improve their health risk management. They must adopt basic occupational health standards and make certain that all workplaces comply with minimum requirements. They must work to promote health and prevent noncommunicable diseases in\nthe workplace, in particular by advocating healthy diet and physical activity among workers, and promoting mental and family health at work. Additionally, the plan suggests that global health threats, such as tuberculosis, HIV/AIDS, malaria, and avian influenza, can also be prevented and controlled at the workplace.\n\nMember states can improve their coverage and quality of occupational health services by integrating their development into national health strategies, health-sector reforms and plans for improving health systems performance; determining standards for organization and coverage of occupational health services; setting targets for increasing the coverage of the working population with occupational health services; creating mechanisms for pooling resources and for financing the delivery of occupational health services; ensuring sufficient and competent human resources; and establishing quality assurance systems.\n\nMember states must design systems for surveillance of workers' health. This includes establishing national information systems, building capability to estimate the occupational burden of diseases and injuries, creating registries of exposure to major risks, occupational accidents and occupational diseases, and improving reporting and early detection of such accidents and diseases. Also strategies and tools need to be elaborated for improving communication and raising awareness about workers' health. They should target workers, employers and their organizations, policy-makers, the general public, and the media.\n\nMeasures to protect workers' health should be incorporated in economic development policies and poverty reduction strategies. Employment policies should be designed to influence worker health.\n\nThe plan suggests that improving the health of workers can be achieved through well-coordinated efforts of society as a whole, under government leadership and with substantial participation of workers and employers. WHO and its partners express in the plan an intention to work with the member states to promote partnership and joint action with ILO and other organizations of\nthe United Nations system, organizations of employers, trade unions, and other stakeholders in civil society and the private sector in order to strengthen international efforts on workers' health. Also to implement the plan the WHO expects to provide guidelines, promote and monitor their use, and contribute to the adoption and implementation of international labor conventions. The plan of action will be reviewed and monitored using a set of national and international indicators of achievement.\n"}
