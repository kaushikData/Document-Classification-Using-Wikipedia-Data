The infection affected poultry at one of Bernard Matthews' farms in Holton in Suffolk. It was the third instance of H5N1-subtype detected in the United Kingdom and a range of precautions were instituted to prevent spread of the disease including a large cull of turkeys, the imposition of segregation zones, and a disinfection programme for the plant.\n\nThe cause of the outbreak was not determined. However, it was considered significant that Bernard Matthews regularly transports turkeys and turkey products between the UK and its plant in Hungary, and that the H5N1 strains previously found in Hungary, and those found at Suffolk, were effectively genetically identical.\n\nH5N1 is a subtype of the Influenza A virus, the viruses responsible for influenza in humans and many other animal species. A bird-adapted strain of H5N1, called \"HPAI A(H5N1)\" for \"highly pathogenic avian influenza virus of type A of subtype H5N1\", is the causative agent of H5N1 flu.\n\nHPAI A(H5N1) is considered an avian disease, although there is some evidence of limited human-to-human transmission of the virus. A risk factor for contracting the virus is handling of infected poultry, but transmission of the virus from infected birds to humans is inefficient. Poultry farming practices have changed due to H5N1. The cost of poultry farming has increased, while the cost to consumers has gone down, due to fears from H5N1 driving demand below supply.\n\nThe outbreak was the third instance of H5N1 detected in the United Kingdom. The first outbreak occurred in October 2005 among exotic birds imported from Taiwan and South America at a privately owned quarantine facility in Essex, England. The second instance involved a dead whooper swan found to have the virus in Cellardyke, Scotland in April 2006. A corresponding incidence on a farm in south-eastern Hungary was confirmed by the European Commission on 25 January 2007.\n\nInitial signs of the outbreak occurred on Tuesday, 30 January when 55 turkey poults died and 16 had to be killed because they were sick. At least 185 more died the following day.\n\nIt was not until 1 February that the deaths were reported to Defra. The farm was sealed off while tests were carried out, on samples taken from the dead birds, at the Veterinary Laboratories Agency in Weybridge, Surrey. Another 1,500 birds died on 2 February. Then on 3 February 2007 the H5N1 causation was confirmed.\n\nA 3 km protection zone, 10 km surveillance zone and a restricted zone encompassing 2000 km were set up. Another 159,000 turkeys were slaughtered with the cull being completed on the evening of 5 February. Also on 5 February there was criticism that nearby farmers had not been advised as to the action to be taken. Around 320 workers at the plant were given anti-viral drugs. Although a vet from the site was admitted into hospital, suffering from a 'mild respiratory illness' during the evening of 6 February, it was found not to be bird flu. The plant was thoroughly disinfected, with cleaning complete on 12 February, and permission being given for production to resume.\n\nIt emerged in a highly critical report from Defra that there was a series of biosecurity failings at the Holton plant, some of which were drawn to the company's attention in the past. These included \"gulls were taking turkey waste to roosts on top of the turkey-house 500 m away\" and \"holes in the turkey houses could have allowed in birds or rodents\". Defra minister Jeff Rooker stated in a House of Lords debate on 22 February that the outbreak was \"exclusively a Bernard Matthews Holton problem\".\n\nThe Government, on 8 February, admitted that the outbreak may have been caused by semi-processed turkey meat imported directly from Hungary, where the disease is prevalent, despite earlier in the week the Environment Secretary, David Miliband assuring the House of Commons that there was \"no Hungarian connection\".\n\nBernard Matthews had been importing 38 tons of partly processed turkey meat on a weekly basis from their Saga Foods company, in Sárvár, Hungary, to a processing plant next to the farm. Though Saga Foods lies from where the recent Hungarian H5N1 outbreak had occurred, a company director admitted it was \"possible\" that some of the meat could have come from the exclusion zone. In response to this revelation, Whitehall expressed concern over biosecurity and whether any meat may have been distributed for human consumption in Britain. On 9 February 2007 the Hungarian authorities started an investigation to try to establish whether there was a connection between the Suffolk and Hungarian outbreaks. On 11 February the investigation revealed that turkey products were still being transported, in both directions, between the plant and Hungary with EU regulations being cited as the reason why a transport ban could not be imposed.\n\nThe Hungary link was dismissed by the European Commission on 12 February. Even so, the H5N1 bird flu strains found in Hungary and Britain were shown to be 99.96% genetically identical and, according to an analysis of the viruses by the Veterinary Laboratories Agency in Weybridge, Surrey, were almost certainly linked. A leak from the Government's COBRA emergency committee indicated that the authorities were not aware of the Hungarian connection until an investigator found a Gallfoods delivery wrapper in a Bernard Matthews bin. This raised the possibility that the outbreak was due to a \"third party abattoir, Gallfoods in Hungary, just outside the restricted zone\". This abattoir might have been a middle man for contaminated poultry farming tools, feed, or product from within the restricted zone, such as a Bernard Matthews owned subsidiary in Hungary.\n\nIn response to the incident and allegations of a cover-up, Bernard Matthews himself stated on 14 February \"I'm sorry - but this has not been of our making. There's been absolutely no cover up at our end. I've been upset about allegations that we may have withheld information. That is completely untrue.\"\n\nBernard Matthews was given permission to resume its shipments of poultry between the UK and Hungary from 17 February even though Defra indicated that Hungarian turkey products remained the \"most plausible\" cause of the outbreak.\n\nBy 8 February there was a lengthening list of countries that had banned the importation of poultry products from Britain including South Africa, Russia, Japan, and many others but a spokesman for the European Commission condemned the bans as \"totally disproportionate\" and the British Poultry Council pointed out that exports were less than 9% of the level of domestic sales. Supermarket sales of Bernard Matthews branded turkeys halved after the onset of the outbreak as shoppers sought out alternatives. One of the biggest ongoing surveys of consumer confidence revealed that, by 13 February 2007, Bernard Matthews was the least respected and trusted brand in Britain.\n\nFollowing the outbreak the company confirmed, on 19 February 2007, that 130 workers would be laid off for a period of twenty days due to a drop in product sales. The Transport and General Workers' Union then called for the government to provide compensation to the workers affected. The Transport and General Workers' Union paid out hardship monies from union funds to union members, on top of any state benefits to which the laid-off workers were entitled and a one-off £100 payment from Bernard Matthews.\n\nA row broke out on 1 March 2007 when it emerged that the Government were paying compensation to the company for the 159,000 culled turkeys while laid-off workers were receiving nothing. At £3.75 each for hens and £3.53 for toms, the payout was then estimated at between £537,000 and £570,000. In the event, though, the actual compensation bill came out at £589,356.89. The crisis cost Bernard Matthews at least £20 m in lost sales and costs.\n\n"}

They were personal companion spirits, comparable to the Roman \"genii\", who ensured good luck, health, and wisdom.\n\nThough little noted in Greek mythology (Pausanias conjectured that the name was merely an epithet of Zeus), he was prominent in Greek folk religion; it was customary to drink or pour out a few drops of unmixed wine to honor him in every symposium or formal banquet. In Aristophanes' \"Peace\", when War has trapped Peace (Εἰρήνη \"Eirene\") in a deep pit, Hermes comes to give aid: \"Now, oh Greeks! is the moment when, freed of quarrels and fighting, we should rescue sweet \"Eirene\" and draw her out of this pit... This is the moment to drain a cup in honor of the \"Agathos Daimon\".\" A temple dedicated to him was situated on the road from Megalopolis to Maenalus in Arcadia.\n\n\"Agathos Daimon\" was the spouse or companion of \"Tyche Agathe\" (, \"Good Fortune\"; ). \"Tyche we know at Lebadeia as the wife of the Agathos Daimon, the Good or Rich Spirit\". His numinous presence could be represented in art as a serpent or more concretely as a young man bearing a cornucopia and a bowl in one hand, and a poppy and an ear of grain in the other. The agathodaemon was later adapted into a general daemon of \"fortuna\", particularly of the continued abundance of a family's good food and drink.\n\nIn the syncretic atmosphere of Late Antiquity, agathodaemons could be bound up with Egyptian bringers of security and good fortune: a gem carved with magic emblems bears the images of Serapis with crocodile, sun-lion and Osiris mummy surrounded by the lion-headed snake Cnum–Agathodaemon–Aion, with Harpocrates on the reverse.\n\n\n"}

ASN publishes four journals in the field of nutrition. It has been criticized for its financial ties to the food and beverage industry.\n\nIn 1928 a group of United States biochemists and physiologists grouped together to form the first scientific society focused on nutrition, the American Institute for Nutrition. The Society held its first meeting at the Cornell Medical School in 1934. The society was renamed the American Society for Nutritional Sciences in 1996.\n\nIn 2005, the American Society for Nutritional Sciences, the American Society for Clinical Nutrition (established 1961); and the Society for International Nutrition (established 1996) merged to form The American Society for Nutrition (ASN).\n\nASN currently (2015) has a membership of about 5,000. It is one of the constituent societies comprising the Federation of American Societies for Experimental Biology, a non-profit organization that is the principal umbrella organization of U.S. societies in the field of biological and medical research.\n\nIn October 2010, the American College of Nutrition and American Society for Nutrition proposed to merge.\n\nThe ASN administered the \"Smart Choices\" food labelling program, which was suspended in 2009 after criticism.\n\nASN publishes four academic journals. Both publisher and some editorial staff accept funding from food industry organizations.\n\nThe 2017 \"Current Developments in Nutrition\" is an open-access journal aiming for rapid publication and a broader range of topics than the ASN's other journals.\n\nEligibility for membership:\n\nASN uses the term \"Sustaining Partners\" for corporate sponsors donating over $10,000 per year. According to their website:\n\nIndustry companies with the highest level of commitment to the nutrition profession are recognized as Sustaining Partners of the American Society for Nutrition. Engage with ASN as a Sustaining Partner today, and benefit from a number of advantages! Recognition includes print and online exposure, annual meeting benefits, and the ability to sponsor educational opportunities, grants and other items.

In mammals, including humans, domoic acid acts as a neurotoxin, causing permanent short-term memory loss, brain damage, and death in severe cases. \n\nThis toxin is produced naturally by marine diatoms belonging to the genus \"Pseudo-nitzschia\" and the species \"Nitzschia navis-varingica\". When accumulated in high concentrations by shellfish during filter feeding, domoic acid can then be passed on to birds, marine mammals and humans via consumption of the contaminated shellfish.\n\nAlthough human illness due to domoic acid has only been associated with shellfish, the toxin can bioaccumulate in many marine organisms that consume phytoplankton, such as anchovies and sardines. Intoxication by domoic acid in non-human organisms is frequently referred to as domoic acid poisoning or DAP.\n\nIn the brain, domoic acid especially damages the hippocampus and amygdaloid nucleus. It damages the neurons by activating AMPA and kainate receptors, causing an influx of calcium. Although calcium flowing into cells is a normal event, the uncontrolled increase of calcium causes the cell to degenerate. See reviews by Ramsdell (2007) and Pulido (2008).\n\nGastrointestinal symptoms can appear 24 hours after ingestion of affected molluscs. They may include vomiting, nausea, diarrhea, abdominal cramps and haemorrhagic gastritis. In more severe cases, neurological symptoms can take several hours or up to three days to develop. These include headache, dizziness, disorientation, vision disturbances, loss of short-term memory, motor weakness, seizures, profuse respiratory secretions, hiccups, unstable blood pressure, cardiac arrhythmia and coma.\n\nPeople poisoned with very high doses of the toxin or displaying risk factors such as old age and renal failure can die. Death has occurred in 4 of 107 confirmed cases. In a few cases, permanent sequelae included short-term memory loss and peripheral polyneuropathy.\n\nThere is no known antidote available for domoic acid, so if symptoms fit the description, it is advised to go quickly to a hospital. Cooking or freezing affected fish or shellfish tissue does not lessen the toxicity.\nNew research has found that domoic acid is a heat-resistant and very stable toxin which can damage kidneys at concentrations that are 100 times lower than what causes neurological effects.\n\nASP was first discovered in humans late in 1987, when a serious outbreak of food poisoning occurred in eastern Canada. Three elderly patients died and other victims suffered long-term neurological problems. Because the victims suffered from memory loss, the term \"amnesic\" shellfish poisoning is used. The story made front-page newspaper headlines.\n\nEpidemiologists from Health Canada quickly linked the illnesses to restaurant meals of cultured mussels harvested from one area in Prince Edward Island, a place never before affected by toxic algae. Mouse bioassays on aqueous extracts of the suspect mussels caused death with some unusual neurotoxic symptoms very different from those of paralytic shellfish poisoning toxins and other known toxins. On December 12, 1987, a team of scientists was assembled at the National Research Council of Canada laboratory in Halifax, Nova Scotia. Integrating bioassay-directed fractionation with chemical analysis, the team identified the toxin on the afternoon of December 16, just 4 days after the start of the concerted investigation.\n\nOn June 22, 2006, a California brown pelican, possibly under the influence of domoic acid, flew through the windshield of a car on the Pacific Coast Highway. The phycotoxin is found in the local coastal waters.\n\nSince March 2007, marine mammal and seabird strandings and deaths off the Southern California coast have increased markedly. These incidents have been linked to the recent and dramatic increase of a naturally occurring toxin produced by algae. Most of the animals found dead tested positive for domoic acid.\n\nAccording to the Channel Islands Marine and Wildlife Institute (CIMWI), \"It is generally accepted that the incidence of problems associated with toxic algae is increasing. Possible reasons to explain this increase include natural mechanisms of species dispersal (currents and tides) to a host of human-related phenomena such as nutrient enrichment (agricultural run-off), climate shifts or transport of algae species via ship ballast water.\"\n\nIn the TV series \"Elementary\" episode \"The Red Team\" (original air date January 31, 2013), a witness is intentionally poisoned with domoic acid.\n\nIn the \"Bad Fish\" episode of \"Get a Life\" (original air-date: February 2, 1992), Sharon and Gus get amnesia after eating bad shellfish, and Chris seizes the opportunity to convince them that they are his best friends.\n\nDomoic acid poisoning may have caused an August 18, 1961 invasion of thousands of frantic seabirds in Capitola and Santa Cruz, California. Director Alfred Hitchcock heard about this invasion while working on his adaptation of the Daphne du Maurier novelette \"The Birds\" for his feature film \"The Birds\" (1963), and asked the \"Santa Cruz Sentinel\" newspaper for any further news copy as \"research for his new thriller.\"\n\n\n"}

The document is a \"Guide\", in other words, not a European Standard (EN). The guide is identical to ISO/IEC Guide 71 and was adopted by both the CEN Technical Board and the CENELEC Technical Board, and published in January 2002. The adoption of CEN/CENELEC Guide 6 resulted from a European mandate to the European standardisation organisations, and the European Commission is funding projects to promote the use of the Guide.\n\nA revised version was published in December 2014; it is identical to ISO/IEC Guide 71:2014. \n\nIn 2000 ISO and IEC published the policy statement: \"Addressing the needs of older persons and people with disabilities in standardization work\". This policy statement recognised the need to include the requirements of older persons and persons with disabilities during the development and revision of standards. The document stated that this could be achieved by following the basic principles of:\nThe policy statement also recommended using ISO/IEC Guide 71, which would become available in 2001. ISO/IEC Guide 71:2001: \"Guidelines for standardization to address the needs of older persons and people with disabilities\" was published in 2001 and has been widely accepted: it has been used in Japan and was adopted by CEN and CENELEC as CEN/CENELEC Guide 6 (see below). ISO/IEC Guide 71 was also made available in Braille and was the first ISO publication that was made available in this format.\n\nCEN and CENELEC adopted ISO/IEC Guide 71 as CEN/CENELEC Guide 6 as a result of Mandate M/283, which the European Commission and the European Fee Trade Association (EFTA) gave to the three official European standardisation bodies CEN, CENELEC and ETSI. The text of the Mandate pointed out that special needs were addressed in standards related to assistive technologies, but that\nGuide 6 is part of a wider framework that standardisation organisations can use to support the need for more accessible products and services. The ISO/IEC Policy Statement 2000 \"Addressing the Needs of Older Persons and People with Disabilities in Standardization Work\" already provided principles and considerations for ensuring that the needs of older persons and persons with disabilities are addressed in the standardisation process.\n\nETSI, the third European standardisation body to which Mandate M/283 was addressed, did not adopt CEN/CENELEC Guide 6 but continued using ISO/IEC Guide 71 as a reference document. Since 2008 ISO/IEC Guide 71 has a supporting document: ISO/TR 22411:2008: \"Ergonomics data and guidelines for the application of ISO/IEC Guide 71 to products and services to address the needs of older persons and persons with disabilities\".\n\nIn December 2014 CEN and CENELEC adopted the revised ISO/IEC Guide 71: 2014 as CEN-CENELEC Guide 6:2014. This new version of Guide 6 is freely available on the website of CEN and CENELEC.\n\nCEN/CENELEC Guide 6 is a document for participants in CEN technical bodies: Technical Committees or TCs, Working Groups or WGs, Task Forces, Workshops etcetera. These technical bodies are responsible for addressing the needs of persons with disabilities and older people in the standards, specifications, reports or other documents that they produce.\n\nCEN/CENELEC Guide 6 has three goals:\n\nThe Guide consists of a few introductory sections followed by 10 other chapters which are called \"clauses\". The most important chapters are described in the list below.\n\nIn December 2001, CEN and CENELEC published CEN/CENELEC Guide 2: \"CEN/CENELEC Guide 2: Consumer interests and the preparation of standards\", which is a republication of CEN/CENELEC Memorandum 2 from 1977. This guide recommends member bodies of CEN and CENELEC to consult with consumer organisations when developing standards that are relevant to consumer interests. CEN/CENELEC Guide 2 is older than Guide 6 and therefore does not reference it.\n\nAt the end of 2004, CEN adopted a \"Mechanism on the use of the CEN/CENELEC Guide 6\" According to ANEC it took two years to develop this mechanism and its adoption followed after \"intense lobbying by ANEC\". The implementation mechanism has several implications:\n\nCEN/CENELEC Guide 11: \"Product information relevant to consumers - Guidelines for standard developers\" was published in 2006 and refers to CEN/CENELEC Guide 6 for guidance on informational needs of people with disabilities and older people.\n\nIn 2006 CEN sent a questionnaire on the use of Guide 6 to its technical committees. The results showed that 3 out of 275 CEN committees used the Guide 6. ANEC decided to propose to CEN how to take an initiative to change the situation. In 2007-2008, NEN - the Dutch standardisation organisation - and Standard Norge carried out a feasibility study within the European Mandate M/371. One of the findings was that the implementation of Guide 6 faced some difficulties. For this reason, NEN and CEN started an action to promote the use of Guide 6, and in December 2007 NEN proposed the installation of an CEN/CENELEC/BT/WG Accessibility for All. ANEC also supported the creation of such a working group. This led to the creation of the CEN/CENELEC/BT/WG \"CEN/CENELEC Guide 6 Implementation Mechanism\". The working group held a preliminary meeting on 29 October 2008 and its first official meeting on 8 April 2009.\n\nIn August 2008, the European Commission published a call for tenders on the subject of \"Training of Stakeholders on consultations on standardisation\" The main goal of this call is promoting the use of Guide 6:\nA guide for standardisers to address the needs of older persons and persons with disabilities (CEN/CENELEC Guide 6), has been developed and is available since 2003 but its use is not widespread. The use of Guide 6 in a more systematic way can certainly help to address the needs of people with disabilities and older persons from a \"design for all\" perspective.\nThe use of the guide should be promoted by training two types of stakeholders in the standardisation process:\n\nThe European project USEM (User Empowerment in Standardisation) also used CEN/CENELEC Guide 6 in its training on standardisation for representatives of older persons and persons with disabilities.\n\nCEN/CENELEC Guide 6 is also available in other languages, usually as a translation of ISO/IEC Guide 71, for example:\n\n\n \n"}

Because of this function, radioisotopes of iodine are concentrated in the thyroid gland along with nonradioactive iodine. In the case of a nuclear accident, the radioactive iodine-131 (I-131), which has a high fission product yield, is released into the environment. I-131 concentrates in the thyroid, and may cause cancer.\n\nTreatment of thyroid cancer may require surgery. \nThe surgery may leave the patient with one or two horizontal scars at the base of the neck, dubbed the Chernobyl necklace.\n\nAfter the Chernobyl disaster, incidents of thyroid cancer among civilians in Belarus, Ukraine, Russia, and Poland have risen sharply. \nIt is estimated that many of those affected have the necklace, however, no statistical information of the affected population exists at this time.

It is formed under the influence of progesterone and forms highly characteristic cells.\n\nThe part of the decidua that interacts with the trophoblast is the \"decidua basalis\" (also called \"decidua placentalis\"), while the \"decidua capsularis\" grows over the embryo on the luminal side, enclosing it into the endometrium. The remainder of the decidua is termed the \"decidua parietalis\" or \"decidua vera\", and it will fuse with the decidua capsularis by the fourth month of gestation.\n\nThree morphologically distinct layers of the decidua basalis can then be described:\nWithin the decidua, occasional fibrinoid deposits form where the syncytiotrophoblast is damaged. The region of fibrinoid deposition where trophoblasts meet the compact portion of the decidua basalis is called \"Rohr's layer\", while the fibrinoid deposits that occur between the compact and spongy layer of the decidua basalis is termed Nitabuch's layer. This layer is absent in placenta accreta.\nThe decidua has a histologically-distinct appearance, displaying large polygonal decidual cells in the stroma. These are enlarged endometrial stromal cells, which resemble epithelium (and are referred to as \"epithelioid\").\n\nDecidualization includes the process of differentiation of the spindle-shape stromal fibroblasts into the plump secretory decidual cells, which create a pericellular extracellular matrix rich in fibronectin and laminin (similar to epithelial cells).\n\nVascularity, as well as vascular permeability, is enhanced in the decidualizing endometrium.\n\nIts leukocyte population is distinct, with the presence of large endometrial granular leukocytes being predominant, while polynuclear leukocytes and B cells are scant.\n\nThe large granular lymphocytes (CD56 bright) are called \"uterine NK cells\" or \"uNK cells\" in mice, and \"decidual NK cells\" or \"dNK cells\" in humans.\n\nAfter ovulation, in placental mammals, the endometrial lining becomes hypertrophic and vascular under the influence of Estrogens and progesterone.\n\nIn animals exhibiting hemochorial placentation, the endometrium undergoes decidualization following implantation. If implantation does not occur, the secretory lining will be absorbed (estrous cycle) or shed (menstrual cycle).\n\nThe decidua is shed with the placenta during parturition.\n\nAs the maternal interface to the embryo the decidua participates in the exchanges of nutrition, gas, and waste with the gestation. It also protects the pregnancy from the maternal immune system. Further, the decidua has to allow a very controlled invasion of the trophoblast.\n\nIn invasive placental disorders like placenta accreta decidualization have been consistently found to be deficient.\n\nThe decidua secretes hormones, growth factors, and cytokines. It has receptors for estrogen, progesterone, growth hormone, and others.\n\nAmong its products are hormones commonly associated with other organs such as cortisol, CRF, GnRH, prolactin, and relaxin. Decidual prolactin is not under dopaminergic control.\n\nPregnancy protein 14 (PP-14), also called placental protein 12, and Insulin-like growth factor-binding protein 1(IGFBP1) appear to be specific products of the secretory and decidual lining.\n\nOther factors released include interleukin-15 and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF). A reasonable understanding of the role and interplay of these hormones and factors has not been evolved.\n\n\nA long-lasting infection of the decidua, chronic deciduitis, is associated with pre-term labour.\n\nThe word comes .\n\n"}

{"id": "40159918", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=40159918", "title": "Ecosystem health", "text": "Ecosystem health\n\nEcosystem health is a metaphor used to describe the condition of an ecosystem. Ecosystem condition can vary as a result of fire, flooding, drought, extinctions, invasive species, climate change, mining, overexploitation in fishing, farming or logging, chemical spills, and a host of other reasons. There is no universally accepted benchmark for a healthy ecosystem, rather the apparent health status of an ecosystem can vary depending upon which health metrics are employed in judging it and which societal aspirations are driving the assessment. Advocates of the health metaphor argue for its simplicity as a communication tool. \"Policy-makers and the public need simple, understandable concepts like health.\" Critics worry that ecosystem health, a \"value-laden construct\", is often \"passed off as science to unsuspecting policy makers and the public.\"\n\nThe health metaphor applied to the environment has been in use at least since the early 1800s and the great American conservationist Aldo Leopold (1887–1948) spoke metaphorically of land health, land sickness, mutilation, and violence when describing land use practices. The term \"ecosystem management\" has been in use at least since the 1950s. The term \"ecosystem health\" has become widespread in the ecological literature, as a general metaphor meaning something good, and as an environmental quality goal in field assessments of rivers, lakes, seas, and forests.\n\nRecently however this metaphor has been subject of quantitative formulation using complex systems concepts such as criticality, meaning that a healthy ecosystem is in some sort of balance between adaptability (randomness) and robustness (order) . Nevertheless the universality of criticality is still under examination and is known as the Criticality Hypothesis, which states that systems in a dynamic regime shifting between order and disorder, attain the highest level of computational capabilities and achieve an optimal trade-off between robustness and flexibility. Recent results in cell and evolutionary biology, neuroscience and computer science have great interest in the criticality hypothesis, emphasizing its role as a viable candidate general law in the realm of adaptive complex systems (see and references therein).\n\nThe term ecosystem health has been employed to embrace some suite of environmental goals deemed desirable. Edward Grumbine's highly cited paper \"What is ecosystem management?\" surveyed ecosystem management and ecosystem health literature and summarized frequently encountered goal statements:\n\nGrumbine describes each of these goals as a \"value statement\" and stresses the role of human values in setting ecosystem management goals.\n\nIt is the last goal mentioned in the survey, accommodating humans, that is most contentious. \"We have observed that when groups of stakeholders work to define … visions, this leads to debate over whether to emphasize ecosystem health or human well-being … Whether the priority is ecosystems or people greatly influences stakeholders' assessment of desirable ecological and social states.\" and, for example, \"For some, wolves are critical to ecosystem health and an essential part of nature, for others they are a symbol of government overreach threatening their livelihoods and cultural values.\"\n\nMeasuring ecosystem health requires extensive goal-driven environmental sampling. For example, a vision for ecosystem health of Lake Superior was developed by a public forum and a series of objectives were prepared for protection of habitat and maintenance of populations of some 70 indigenous fish species. A suite of 80 lake health indicators was developed for the Great Lakes Basin including monitoring native fish species, exotic species, water levels, phosphorus levels, toxic chemicals, phytoplankton, zooplankton, fish tissue contaminants, etc.\n\nSome authors have attempted broad definitions of ecosystem health, such as benchmarking as healthy the historical ecosystem state \"prior to the onset of anthropogenic stress.\" A difficulty is that the historical composition of many human-altered ecosystems is unknown or unknowable. Also, fossil and pollen records indicate that the species that occupy an ecosystem reshuffle through time, so it is difficult to identify one snapshot in time as optimum or \"healthy.\".\n\nA commonly cited broad definition states that a healthy ecosystem has three attributes:\n\nWhile this captures significant ecosystem properties, a generalization is elusive as those properties do not necessarily co-vary in nature. For example, there is not necessarily a clear or consistent relationship between productivity and species richness. Similarly, the relationship between resilience and diversity is complex, and ecosystem stability may depend upon one or a few species rather than overall diversity. And some undesirable ecosystems are highly productive.\n\n\"Resilience is not desirable per se. There can be highly resilient states of ecosystems which are very undesirable from some human perspectives , such as algal-dominated coral reefs.\" Ecological resilience is a \"capacity\" that varies depending upon which properties of the ecosystem are to be studied and depending upon what kinds of disturbances are considered and how they are to be quantified. Approaches to assessing it \"face high uncertainties and still require a considerable amount of empirical and theoretical research.\"\n\nOther authors have sought a numerical index of ecosystem health that would permit quantitative comparisons among ecosystems and within ecosystems over time. One such system employs ratings of the three properties mentioned above: Health = system vigor x system organization x system resilience. Ecologist Glenn Suter argues that such indices employ \"nonsense units,\" the indices have \"no meaning; they cannot be predicted, so they are not applicable to most regulatory problems; they have no diagnostic power; effects of one component are eclipsed by responses of other components, and the reason for a high or low index value is unknown.\"\n\nHealth metrics are determined by stakeholder goals, which drive ecosystem definition. An ecosystem is an abstraction. \"Ecosystems cannot be identified or found in nature. Instead, they must be delimited by an observer. This can be done in many different ways for the same chunk of nature, depending on the specific perspectives of interest.\"\n\nEcosystem definition determines the acceptable range of variability (reference conditions) and determines measurement variables. The latter are used as indicators of ecosystem structure and function, and can be used as indicators of \"health\".\n\nAn indicator is a variable, such as a chemical or biological property, that when measured, is used to infer trends in another (unmeasured) environmental variable or cluster of unmeasured variables (the indicandum). For example, rising mortality rate of canaries in a coal mine is an indicator of rising carbon monoxide levels. Rising chlorophyll-a levels in a lake may signal eutrophication.\n\nEcosystem assessments employ two kinds of indicators, descriptive indicators and normative indicators. \"Indicators can be used descriptively for a scientific purpose or normatively for a political purpose.\"\n\nUsed descriptively, high chlorophyll-a is an indicator of eutrophication, but it may also be used as an ecosystem health indicator. When used as a normative (health) indicator, it indicates a rank on a health scale, a rank that can vary widely depending on societal preferences as to what is desirable. A high chlorophyll-a level in a natural successional wetland might be viewed as healthy whereas a human-impacted wetland with the \"same\" indicator value may be judged unhealthy.\n\nEstimation of ecosystem health has been criticized for intermingling the two types of environmental indicators. A health indicator is a normative indicator, and if conflated with descriptive indicators \"implies that normative values can be measured objectively, which is certainly not true. Thus, implicit values are insinuated to the reader, a situation which has to be avoided.\"\n\nIt can be argued that the very act of selecting indicators of any kind is biased by the observer's perspective but separation of goals from descriptions has been advocated as a step toward transparency: \"A separation of descriptive and normative indicators is essential from the perspective of the philosophy of science … Goals and values cannot be deduced directly from descriptions … a fact that is emphasized repeatedly in the literature of environmental ethics … Hence, we advise always specifying the definition of indicators and propose clearly distinguishing ecological indicators in science from policy indicators used for decision-making processes.\"\n\nAnd integration of multiple, possibly conflicting, normative indicators into a single measure of \"ecosystem health\" is problematic. Using 56 indicators, \"determining environmental status and assessing marine ecosystems health in an integrative way is still one of the grand challenges in marine ecosystems ecology, research and management\"\n\nAnother issue with indicators is validity. Good indicators must have an independently validated high predictive value, that is high sensitivity (high probability of indicating a significant change in the indicandum) and high specificity (low probability of wrongly indicating a change). The reliability of various health metrics has been questioned and \"what combination of measurements should be used to evaluate ecosystems is a matter of current scientific debate.\" Most attempts to identify ecological indicators have been correlative rather than derived from prospective testing of their predictive value and the selection process for many indicators has been based upon weak evidence or has been lacking in evidence.\n\nIn some cases no reliable indicators are known: \"We found no examples of invertebrates successfully used in [forest] monitoring programs. Their richness and abundance ensure that they play significant roles in ecosystem function but thwart focus on a few key species.\" And, \"Reviews of species-based monitoring approaches reveal that no single species, nor even a group of species, accurately reflects entire communities. Understanding the response of a single species may not provide reliable predictions about a group of species even when the group is a few very similar species.\"\n\nA trade-off between human health and the \"health\" of nature has been termed the \"health paradox\" and it illuminates how human values drive perceptions of ecosystem health.\n\nHuman health has benefited by sacrificing the \"health\" of wild ecosystems, such as dismantling and damming of wild valleys, destruction of mosquito-bearing wetlands, diversion of water for irrigation, conversion of wilderness to farmland, timber removal, and extirpation of tigers, whales, ferrets, and wolves.\n\nThere has been an acrimonious schism among conservationists and resource managers over the question of whether to \"ratchet back human domination of the biosphere\" or whether to embrace it. These two perspectives have been characterized as utilitarian vs protectionist.\n\nThe utilitarian view treats human health and well-being as criteria of ecosystem health. For example, destruction of wetlands to control malaria mosquitoes \"resulted in an improvement in ecosystem health.\"\nThe protectionist view treats humans as an invasive species: \"If there was ever a species that qualified as an invasive pest, it is \"Homo sapiens\",\"\n\nProponents of the utilitarian view argue that \"healthy ecosystems are characterized by their capability to sustain healthy human populations,\" and \"healthy ecosystems must be economically viable,\" as it is \"unhealthy\" ecosystems that are likely to result in increases in contamination, infectious diseases, fires, floods, crop failures and fishery collapse.\n\nProtectionists argue that privileging of human health is a conflict of interest as humans have demolished massive numbers of ecosystems to maintain their welfare, also disease and parasitism are historically normal in pre-industrial nature. Diseases and parasites promote ecosystem functioning, driving biodiversity and productivity, and parasites may constitute a significant fraction of ecosystem biomass.\n\nThe very choice of the word \"health\" applied to ecology has been questioned as lacking in neutrality in a BioScience article on responsible use of scientific language: \"Some conservationists fear that these terms could endorse human domination of the planet … and could exacerbate the shifting cognitive baseline whereby humans tend to become accustomed to new and often degraded ecosystems and thus forget the nature of the past.\"\n\nCriticism of ecosystem health largely targets the failure of proponents to explicitly distinguish the normative dimension from the descriptive dimension, and has included the following:\n\nAlternatives have been proposed for the term ecosystem health, including more neutral language such as ecosystem status, ecosystem prognosis, and ecosystem sustainability. Another alternative to the use of a health metaphor is to \"express exactly and clearly the public policy and the management objective\", to employ habitat descriptors and real properties of ecosystems. An example of a policy statement is \"The maintenance of viable natural populations of wildlife and ecological functions always takes precedence over any human use of wildlife.\" An example of a goal is \"Maintain viable populations of all native species in situ.\" An example of a management objective is \"Maintain self-sustaining populations of lake whitefish within the range of abundance observed during 1990-99.\"\n\nKurt Jax presented an ecosystem assessment format that avoids imposing a preconceived notion of normality, that avoids the muddling of normative and descriptive, and that gives serious attention to ecosystem definition. (1) Societal purposes for the ecosystem are negotiated by stakeholders, (2) a functioning ecosystem is defined with emphasis on phenomena relevant to stakeholder goals, (3) benchmark reference conditions and permissible variation of the system are established, (4) measurement variables are chosen for use as indicators, and (5) the time scale and spatial scale of assessment are decided.\n\nEcological health has been used as a medical term in reference to human allergy and multiple chemical sensitivity and as a public health term for programs to modify health risks (diabetes, obesity, smoking, etc.). Human health itself, when viewed in its broadest sense, is viewed as having ecological foundations. It is also an urban planning term in reference to \"green\" cities (composting, recycling), and has been used loosely with regard to various environmental issues, and as the condition of human-disturbed environmental sites. Ecosystem integrity implies a condition of an ecosystem exposed to a minimum of human influence. Ecohealth is the relationship of human health to the environment, including the effect of climate change, wars, food production, urbanization, and ecosystem structure and function. Ecosystem management and ecosystem-based management refer to the sustainable management of ecosystems and in some cases may employ the terms ecosystem health or ecosystem integrity as a goal.\n"}

{"id": "620879", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=620879", "title": "Growth hormone deficiency", "text": "Growth hormone deficiency\n\nGrowth hormone deficiency (GHD) is a medical condition due to not enough growth hormone (GH). Generally the most noticeable symptom is a short height. In newborns there may be low blood sugar or a small penis. In adults there may be decreased muscle mass, high cholesterol levels, or poor bone density.\nGHD can be present at birth or develop later in life. Causes may include genetics, trauma, infections, tumors, or radiation therapy. Genes that may be involved include GH1, GHRHR, or BTK. In a third of cases no cause is apparent. The underlying mechanism generally involves problems with the pituitary gland. Some cases are associated with a lack of other pituitary hormones, in which case it is known as combined pituitary hormone deficiency. Diagnosis involves blood tests to measure growth hormone levels.\nTreatment is by growth hormone replacement. The frequency of the condition is unclear. Most cases are initially noticed in children. The genetic forms are estimated to affect about 1 in 7,000 people. Most types occur equally in males and females though males are more often diagnosed.\n\nSevere prenatal deficiency of GH, as occurs in congenital hypopituitarism, has little effect on fetal growth. However, prenatal and congenital deficiency can reduce the size of a male's penis, especially when gonadotropins are also deficient. Besides micropenis in males, additional consequences of severe deficiency in the first days of life can include hypoglycemia and exaggerated jaundice (both direct and indirect hyperbilirubinemia).\n\nEven congenital GH deficiency does not usually impair length growth until after the first few months of life. From late in the first year until mid teens, poor growth and/or shortness is the hallmark of childhood GH deficiency. Growth is not as severely affected in GH deficiency as in untreated hypothyroidism, but growth at about half the usual velocity for age is typical. It tends to be accompanied by delayed physical maturation so that bone maturation and puberty may be several years delayed. When severe GH deficiency is present from birth and never treated, adult heights can be as short as 48-65 inches (122–165 cm).\n\nSevere GH deficiency in early childhood also results in slower muscular development, so that gross motor milestones such as standing, walking, and jumping may be delayed. Body composition (i.e., the relative amounts of bone, muscle, and fat) is affected in many children with severe deficiency, so that mild to moderate chubbiness is common (though GH deficiency alone rarely causes severe obesity). Some severely GH-deficient children have recognizable, cherubic facial features characterized by maxillary hypoplasia and forehead prominence (said to resemble a kewpie doll).\n\nOther side effects in children include sparse hair growth and frontal recession, and pili torti and trichorrhexis nodosa are also sometimes present.\n\nRecognised effects include:\n\nGrowth hormone deficiency in childhood commonly has no identifiable cause (idiopathic), and adult-onset GHD is commonly due to pituitary tumours and their treatment or to cranial irradiation. A more complete list of causes includes:\n\nThere are a variety of rare diseases which resemble GH deficiency, including the childhood growth failure, facial appearance, delayed bone age, and low IGF levels. However, GH testing elicits normal or high levels of GH in the blood, demonstrating that the problem is not due to a deficiency of GH but rather to a reduced sensitivity to its action. Insensitivity to GH is traditionally termed Laron dwarfism, but over the last 15 years many different types of GH resistance have been identified, primarily involving mutations of the GH binding protein or receptors.\n\nAs an adult ages, it is normal for the pituitary to produce diminishing amounts of GH and many other hormones, particularly the sex steroids. Physicians therefore distinguish between the natural reduction in GH levels which comes with age, and the much lower levels of \"true\" deficiency. Such deficiency almost always has an identifiable cause, with adult-onset GHD \"without\" a definable cause (\"idiopathic GH deficiency\") extremely rare. GH does function in adulthood to maintain muscle and bone mass and strength, and has poorly understood effects on cognition and mood.\n\nAlthough GH can be readily measured in a blood sample, testing for GH deficiency is constrained by the fact that levels are nearly undetectable for most of the day. This makes simple measurement of GH in a single blood sample useless for detecting deficiency. Physicians therefore use a combination of indirect and direct criteria in assessing GHD, including:\n\n\"Provocative tests\" involve giving a dose of an agent that will normally provoke a pituitary to release a burst of growth hormone. An intravenous line is established, the agent is given, and small amounts of blood are drawn at 15 minute intervals over the next hour to determine if a rise of GH was provoked. Agents which have been used clinically to stimulate and assess GH secretion are arginine, levodopa, clonidine, epinephrine and propranolol, glucagon and insulin. An insulin tolerance test has been shown to be reproducible, age-independent, and able to distinguish between GHD and normal adults, and so is the test of choice.\n\nSevere GH deficiency in childhood additionally has the following measurable characteristics:\n\nIn childhood and adulthood, the diagnosing doctor will look for these features accompanied by corroboratory evidence of hypopituitarism such as deficiency of other pituitary hormones, a structurally abnormal pituitary, or a history of damage to the pituitary. This would confirm the diagnosis; in the absence of pituitary pathology, further testing would be required.\nGrowth hormone deficiency can be congenital or acquired in childhood or adult life. It can be partial or complete. It is usually permanent, but sometimes transient. It may be an isolated deficiency or occur in association with deficiencies of other pituitary hormones.\n\nThe term hypopituitarism is often used interchangeably with GH deficiency but more often denotes GH deficiency plus deficiency of at least one other anterior pituitary hormone. When GH deficiency (usually with other anterior pituitary deficiencies) is associated with posterior pituitary hormone deficiency (usually diabetes insipidus), the condition is termed panhypopituitarism.\n\nGH deficiency is treated by replacing GH with daily injections under the skin or into muscle. Until 1985, growth hormone for treatment was obtained by extraction from human pituitary glands collected at autopsy. Since 1985, recombinant human growth hormone (rHGH) is a recombinant form of human GH produced by genetically engineered bacteria, manufactured by recombinant DNA technology. In both children and adults, costs of treatment in terms of money, effort, and the impact on day-to-day life, are substantial.\n\nGH treatment is not recommended for children who are not growing despite having normal levels of growth hormone, and in the UK it is not licensed for this use. Children requiring treatment usually receive daily injections of growth hormone. Most pediatric endocrinologists monitor growth and adjust dose every 3–6 months and many of these visits involve blood tests and x-rays. Treatment is usually extended as long as the child is growing, and lifelong continuation may be recommended for those most severely deficient. Nearly painless insulin syringes, pen injectors, or a needle-free delivery system reduce the discomfort. Injection sites include the biceps, thigh, buttocks, and stomach. Injection sites should be rotated daily to avoid lipoatrophy. Treatment is expensive, costing as much as US $10,000 to $40,000 a year in the USA.\n\nGH supplementation is not recommended medically for the physiologic age-related decline in GH/IGF secretion. It may be appropriate in diagnosed adult-onset deficiency, where a weekly dose approximately 25% of that given to children is given. Lower doses again are called for in the elderly to reduce the incidence of side effects and maintain age-dependent normal levels of IGF-1.\n\nIn many countries, including the UK, the majority view among endocrinologists is that the failure of treatment to provide any demonstrable, measurable benefits in terms of outcomes means treatment is not recommended for all adults with severe GHD, and national guidelines in the UK as set out by NICE suggest three criteria which all need to be met for treatment to be indicated:\nWhere treatment is indicated, duration is dependent upon indication.\n\nCost of adult treatment in the UK is 3000-4000 GBP annually.\n\n\nWhen treated with GH, a severely deficient child will begin to grow faster within months. In the first year of treatment, the rate of growth may increase from half as fast as other children are growing to twice as fast (e.g., from 1 inch a year to 4 inches, or 2.5 cm to 10). Growth typically slows in subsequent years, but usually remains above normal so that over several years a child who had fallen far behind in his height may grow into the normal height range. Excess adipose tissue may be reduced.\n\nGH treatment can confer a number of measurable benefits to severely GH-deficient adults, such as enhanced energy and strength, and improved bone density. Muscle mass may increase at the expense of adipose tissue. Although adults with hypopituitarism have been shown to have a reduced life expectancy, and a cardiovascular mortality rate more than double controls, treatment has not been shown to improve mortality, although blood lipid levels do improve. Similarly, although measurements of bone density improve with treatment, rates of fractures have not been shown to improve.\n\nEffects on quality of life are unproven, with a number of studies finding that adults with GHD had near-normal indicators of QoL at baseline (giving little scope for improvement), and many using outdated dosing strategies. However, it may be that those adults with poor QoL at the start of treatment do benefit.\n\nThe incidence of idiopathic GHD in infants is about 1 in every 3800 live births, and rates in older children are rising as more children survive childhood cancers which are treated with radiotherapy, although exact rates are hard to obtain.\n\nThe incidence of genuine adult-onset GHD, normally due to pituitary tumours, is estimated at 10 per million.\n\nLike many other 19th century medical terms which lost precise meaning as they gained wider currency, \"midget\" as a term for someone with severe proportional shortness acquired pejorative connotations and is no longer used in a medical context.\n\nNotable modern pop cultural figures with growth hormone deficiency include actor and comedian Andy Milonakis, who has the appearance and voice of an adolescent boy despite being in his early 40s.\n\n\n"}

Furthermore, many programs devote significant resources to developing cultural competency training to promote the deliverance of culturally sensitive healthcare by faculty, staff, as well as current and future healthcare providers. These services are usually tailored to meeting specific goals or missions of the individual components common in most of the operating Health Disparities Centers. The overall mission of Health Disparities Centers is to eradicate health disparities and improve health care.\n\nThe Minority Health and Health Disparities Act of 2000, Public Law 106-525 led the way for an innovative program established by the National Center on Minority Health and Health Disparities (NCHMD). This program, originally entitled the Project EXPORT, now bears the title of the NCMHD Centers of Excellence (COE) Program. The mission of this program is to develop centers of research, training, partnership and community outreach in the field and study of health disparities. Through grant support from the NCHMD, these centers contribute to scientific advancements and community programs with the aim of eliminating health disparities. Successful centers are currently operating in 31 states, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands. Many of these centers are made in partnerships with research-intensive universities, medical colleges and institutions, historically black colleges and universities, universities that serve Hispanic populations, tribal colleges and liberal arts schools. As of 2007, the NCMHD COE program had supported the development of 37 centers.\n\nIt is a common misconception that Health Disparities Centers are tailored primarily for minorities, but in actuality their mission extends to a wide range of groups. These include age, gender, ethnicity, geographical location, or any other differences related to socioeconomic status or environmental factors. However, the largest disparities are most prominent in minority groups.\n\nAccording to the Healthy People 2010 Objectives list of ten largest Racial and Ethnic disparities:\n\n\nThe focus and importance of addressing growing national health disparities represents a relatively new shift in health research. Both the NCMHD Research Endowment Program and the Community-Based Participatory Research Program are initiatives to promote awareness and research incentives for those interested in studying specific health disparities and the effectiveness of current outreach programs. Major research concentrations currently being studied include, but are not limited to, conditions such as HIV/AIDS, obesity, diabetes, specific types of cancers, cardiovascular diseases, and child health promotion. \n\nA few examples of specific research studies that have been conducted through a partnership of Health Disparities Centers are as follows:\n\n\nAs disproportionate burdens of certain diseases and health conditions among specific populations are a growing concern, so is the need for widespread education and training for both the public and health professionals alike to be able to cope with, and prevent the occurrence of growing disparities in their communities. Health Disparities Centers across the nation are active in implementing educational resources that range from undergraduate and graduate coursework, postdoctoral training opportunities, conference or seminar series, and diversity and cultural competency training programs. Additionally, these centers are devoted to the recruitment and retention of research scientists and healthcare practitioners from racial/ethnic minority groups, people with disabilities and socio-economically disadvantaged individuals. Many institutions support faulty mentoring of underrepresented students who are interested in completing community-based participatory research on health disparities.\n\nThe community outreach component of Health Disparities Centers provides the essential link between advancements in research and implementing significant findings directly into the communities being studied. Emphasis has also been placed on giving target populations affected by health disparities access to health information in a community setting where they feel comfortable to have sensitive health queries addressed. A major goal of Health Disparities Centers is to give the public the knowledge and encouragement necessary to empower them to promote a healthy lifestyle in their homes and communities and be proponents for their own healthcare. Health Disparities Centers also may partner with grassroots and community-based organizations that can serve mediums to disburse educational materials and provide valuable information about the needs of the community to the centers. \nExamples of successful community outreach programs established by national Health Disparities Centers are provided below.\n\n\nThe administration component of numerous Health Disparities Centers is responsible for the oversight and management of all center initiatives and programs and ensures the fiscal responsibility of the institution. It is also common for the governing body of a health disparities center to manage grants and collaborative partnerships between the center and various university, hospital or community entities.\n\nHealth Disparities Centers promote the concept of social justice which is a key facet of sustainability. The process of eliminating health disparities involves breaking language barriers, improving access to health-care, stamping out violence, and alleviating poor health conditions associated with a life of poverty. An example:\n\nEnvironment factors contribute to health disparities. Environmental justice refers to the burden that certain groups experience due to the physical environment that encompasses there day-to-day lives. People in different geographical locations may experience health disparities due to pollutants in the food or air, stress factors caused by their physical environment, and availability of different resources. Many health disparity centers have programs to promote a cleaner environment and healthy lifestyles, preventing disparities caused by the environmental. A few examples:\n\n"}

Typically, researchers will use a survey methodology to gather information about certain people, use statistics in an attempt to generalize the information collected to the entire population, then use the statistical analysis to make a statement about the health of the population.\n\nHealth indicators are often used by governments to guide health care policy.\n\nA common example of a health indicator is life expectancy. A government might have a system for collecting information on each citizen's age at the time of death. This data about age at death can be used to support statements about the national life expectancy, in which case life expectancy would be a \"health indicator\". Life expectancy may be one of many \"health indicators\" which collectively researchers would use to describe the health of the population of the country.\n\nHealth indicators are commonly used to guide public health policy.\n\nA health indicator which will be used internationally to describe global health should have the following characteristics:\n\nHealth indicators are required in order to measure the health status of people and communities.\n\n\n\nIncidence counts of any of the following in a population may be health indicators:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVarious organizations exist to identify, collect, measure, share, analyze, and publish on the topic of health indicators.

{"id": "5659119", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=5659119", "title": "History of pizza", "text": "History of pizza\n\nThe history of pizza begins in antiquity, when various ancient cultures produced basic flatbreads with several toppings.\n\nThe precursor of pizza was probably the focaccia, a flat bread known to the Romans as \"panis focacius\", to which toppings were then added. Modern pizza developed in Naples, when tomato was added to the focaccia in the late 18th century.\n\nThe word \"pizza\" was first documented in 997 AD in Gaeta and successively in different parts of Central and Southern Italy. Pizza was mainly eaten in the country of Italy and by emigrants from there. This changed after World War II, when Allied troops stationed in Italy came to enjoy pizza along with other Italian foods.\n\nFoods similar to pizza have been made since the neolithic age. Records of people adding other ingredients to bread to make it more flavorful can be found throughout ancient history.\n\n\nSome commentators have suggested that the origins of modern pizza can be traced to \"pizzarelle\", which were kosher for Passover cookies eaten by Roman Jews after returning from the synagogue on that holiday, though some also trace its origins to other Italian paschal breads. Abba Eban has suggested that modern pizza \"was first made more than 2000 years ago when Roman soldiers added cheese and olive oil to matzah\".\n\nOther examples of flatbreads that survive to this day from the ancient Mediterranean world are focaccia (which may date back as far as the ancient Etruscans); Manakish in Lebanon, coca (which has sweet and savory varieties) from Catalonia; Valencia and the Balearic Islands; the Greek Pita; Lepinja in the Balkans; or Piadina in the Romagna part of Emilia-Romagna in Italy.\n\nFoods similar to flatbreads in other parts of the world include Chinese bing (a wheat flour-based Chinese food with a flattened or disk-like shape); the Indian paratha (in which fat is incorporated); the Central and South Asian naan (leavened) and roti (unleavened); the Sardinian carasau, spianata, guttiau, pistoccu; and Finnish rieska. Also worth noting is that throughout Europe there are many similar pies based on the idea of covering flat pastry with cheese, meat, vegetables and seasoning such as the Alsatian flammkuchen, German zwiebelkuchen, and French quiche.\n\nIn 16th-century Naples, a galette flatbread was referred to as a pizza. Known as the dish for poor people, it was sold in the street and was not considered a kitchen recipe for a long time. This was later replaced by oil, tomatoes (after Europeans came into contact with the Americas) or fish. In 1843, Alexandre Dumas, père, described the diversity of pizza toppings. An often recounted story holds that on 11 June 1889, to honour the Queen consort of Italy, Margherita of Savoy, the Neapolitan pizzamaker Raffaele Esposito created the \"Pizza Margherita\", a pizza garnished with tomatoes, mozzarella, and basil, to represent the national colours of Italy as on the Italian flag.\n\nPizza is now a type of bread and tomato dish, often served with cheese. However, until the late nineteenth or early twentieth century, the dish was sweet, not savory, and earlier versions which were savory more resembled the flat breads now known as schiacciata. Pellegrino Artusi's classic early-twentieth-century cookbook, \"La Scienza in cucina e l'Arte di mangiar bene\" gives three recipes for pizza, all of which are sweet. After the dispute of some readers, Artusi will add in a copy of 1911 edition (founded by food historian Alberto Capatti) a typed sheet, bound with the volume, with the recipe of \"pizza alla napoletana\": mozzarella, tomatoes, anchovies and mushrooms. \n\nHowever, by 1927, Ada Boni's collection of regional cooking includes a recipe using tomatoes and mozzarella.\n\nThe innovation that led to flat bread pizza was the use of tomato as a topping. For some time after the tomato was brought to Europe from the Americas in the 16th century, it was believed by many Europeans to be poisonous (as some other fruits of the nightshade family are). However, by the late 18th century, it was common for the poor of the area around Naples to add tomato to their yeast-based flat bread, and so the pizza began. The dish gained popularity, and soon pizza became a tourist attraction as visitors to Naples ventured into the poorer areas of the city to try the local specialty.\n\nAccording to documents founded by historian Antonio Mattozzi in State Archive of Naples, in 1807 already 54 pizzerias existed, with their owners and addresses. In the second half of the nineteenth century they increased to 120.\n\nIn Naples two others figures existed, connected to the trade: the pizza hawker (\"pizzaiuolo ambulante\n\"), \"who sold pizza but he did not make it, and the seller of pizza \" a oggi a otto\", who made pizzas but sold them in return for a payment for seven days\". \n\nPurists, like the famous pizzeria \"Da Michele\" in Via C. Sersale, consider there to be only two true pizzas—the marinara and the margherita—and that is all they serve. These two \"pure\" pizzas are the ones preferred by many Italians today.\n\nThe marinara is the older of the two and has a topping of tomato, oregano, garlic, and extra virgin olive oil. It is named “marinara” because it was traditionally the food prepared by \"la marinara\", the seaman's wife, for her seafaring husband when he returned from fishing trips in the Bay of Naples.\n\nThe margherita is topped with modest amounts of tomato sauce, mozzarella cheese and fresh basil. It is widely attributed to baker Raffaele Esposito, who worked at \"Pizzeria di Pietro\", established in 1880. Though recent research casts doubt on this legend, the tale holds that, in 1889, he baked three different pizzas for the visit of King Umberto I and Queen Margherita of Savoy. The Queen's favorite was a pizza evoking the colors of the Italian flag—green (basil leaves), white (mozzarella), and red (tomatoes). According to the tale, this combination was named Pizza Margherita in her honor. Although those were the most preferred, today there are many variations of pizzas.\n\n\"Associazione Verace Pizza Napoletana\" (\"True Neapolitan Pizza Association\"), which was founded in 1984, has set the very specific rules that must be followed for an authentic Neapolitan pizza. These include that the pizza must be baked in a wood-fired, domed oven; that the base must be hand-kneaded and must not be rolled with a pin or prepared by any mechanical means (\"i pizzaioli\"—the pizza makers—make the pizza by rolling it with their fingers) and that the pizza must not exceed 35 centimetres in diameter or be more than one-third of a centimetre thick at the centre. The association also selects pizzerias all around the world to produce and spread the verace pizza napoletana philosophy and method.\n\nThere are many famous pizzerias in Naples where these traditional pizzas can be found such as Da Michele, Port'Alba, Brandi, Di Matteo, Sorbillo, Trianon, and Umberto (founded: 1916). Most of them are in the ancient historical centre of Naples. These pizzerias will go even further than the specified rules by, for example, using only San Marzano tomatoes grown on the slopes of Mount Vesuvius and drizzling the olive oil and adding tomato topping in only a clockwise direction.\n\nThe pizza bases in Naples are soft and pliable. In Rome they prefer a thin and crispy base. Another popular form of pizza in Italy is \"pizza al taglio\", which is pizza baked in rectangular trays with a wide variety of toppings and sold by weight.\n\nIn 1962, the \"Hawaiian\" pizza, a pizza topped with pineapple and ham, was invented in Canada by restaurateur Sam Panopoulis at the Satellite Restaurant in Chatham, Ontario.\n\nIn December 2009, the pizza napoletana was granted Traditional Speciality Guaranteed status by the European Union.\n\nIn 2012, the world's largest pizza was made in Rome, and was measured to be 1261.65 square metres.\n\nIn 2016, robotics company BeeHex, widely covered in the media, was building robots that 3D-printed pizza.\n\nIn December 2017, the pizza napoletana was inscribed on the UNESCO Intangible Cultural Heritage Lists.\n\nCanada was first introduced to pizza in the late 1950s, with the first pizza ovens entering the country. It gained popularity throughout the 1960s, with many pizzerias and restaurants opening across the country. Pizza was mostly served in restaurants and small pizzerias. Most pizza restaurants across Canada also serve popular Italian cuisine in addition to pizza, such as pasta, salad, soups and sandwiches. Fast-food pizza chains also provide other side options for customers to choose from, in addition to ordering pizza, including chicken wings, fries and poutine, salad, and calzones. Pizza Pops are a Canadian calzone-type snack introduced in the 1960s. Pizza chains across Canada can be found in shopping centres, schools, and neighbourhood plazas, with the majority of these chains offering a sit-and-dine facility for customers.\n\nThe most distinct pizza in Canada is the \"Canadian\" pizza. A \"Canadian\" pizza is usually prepared with tomato sauce, mozzarella cheese, mushrooms and bacon. Many variations of this pizza exist, but the two standout ingredients that make this pizza distinctly Canadian are bacon and mushrooms. Pizzas in Canada are almost never served with \"Canadian bacon\", or back bacon as it's referred to in Canada. Rather, side bacon is the standard pork topping on pizza.\n\nIn Canada, pizza is served on a variety of crust types, including a traditional-style pan crust, a thin crust, multi-grain crust, whole-grain crust, and a gluten-free crust. Stuffed-crust pizza is also a popular pizza alternative for Canadian customers. It contains pizza toppings of the customer’s choice on a mozzarella-filled crust.\n\nIn the province of Quebec Pizza-ghetti is a combination meal commonly found in fast food or family restaurants. It consists of a pizza, sliced in half, accompanied by a small portion of spaghetti with a tomato based sauce. Although both pizza and spaghetti are considered staples of Italian cuisine, combining them in one dish is completely unknown in Italy. A popular variant involves using spaghetti as a pizza topping, under the pizza's mozzarella cheese\n\nSome of Canada's successful pizza brands include: Boston Pizza, Pizza Pizza, and Vanelli’s. Boston Pizza, also known as BP’s in Canada, and \"Boston's—the Gourmet Pizza\" in the United States and Mexico, is one of Canada’s largest franchising restaurants. The brand has opened over 325 locations across Canada and 50 locations in Mexico and the US. The first Boston Pizza location was opened in Edmonton, Alberta, in 1964, and operated under the name \"Boston Pizza & Spaghetti House\", with locations still opening across the nation. It is the first Canadian restaurant to introduce the heart-shaped pizza on Valentine’s Day, a 22-year tradition, where a dollar from each pizza ordered supports Boston Pizza Foundation Future Prospects. Pizza Pizza, and its subsidiary chain Pizza 73 in Western Canada, are among Canada’s largest domestic brands based in Ontario. To date, they have over 500 locations nationwide, and fill more than 29 million orders annually.\nVanelli’s is an international pizza chain that is based in Mississauga, Ontario. The chain first opened in 1981, serving both pizza and other fresh Italian cuisine, such as pasta and Italian sandwiches. In 1995, the brand opened its first international location in Bahrain and became an international success. The brand continued to open additional locations across the Middle East, with chains now opened in the United Arab Emirates, Lebanon, and Morocco. There are over 110 locations worldwide; making Vanelli’s the first pizza brand in Canada to open locations internationally.\n\nWith pizza gaining popularity across the nation, major American pizza chains such as Pizza Hut, Domino’s Pizza and Little Caesars have expanded their locations in Canada, competing against the domestic Canadian brands. The major American pizza chains have brought their signature classic pizza recipes and toppings into their Canadian chains, offering their traditional classic pizzas to Canadian customers. However, the American chains have also created Canadian specialty pizzas that are available only in Canada. Pizzas that have been made exclusively for Canada by the American chain Pizza Hut for a limited time, included the following:\n\n\nPizza first made its appearance in the United States with the arrival of Italian immigrants in the late 19th century and was very popular among large Italian populations in New York City, Chicago, Philadelphia, and Saint Louis. In the late 19th century, pizza was introduced by peddlers who walked up and down the streets with a metal washtub of pizzas on their heads, selling their pizzas at two cents a slice. It was not long until small cafes and groceries began offering pizzas to their Italian American communities.\n\nThe first printed reference to \"pizza\" served in the US is a 1904 article in \"The Boston Journal\". Giovanni and Gennaro Bruno came to America from Naples, Italy in 1903 to introduce the Neapolitan Pizza. Vincent (Jimmy) Bruno (Giovanni's son) went on to open the first pizzeria in The Loop in Chicago at 421 S. Wabash Avenue, the Yacht Club. Gennaro Lombardi opened a grocery store in 1897 which was later established as the \"said\" first pizzeria in America in 1905 with New York's issuance of the mercantile license. An employee of his, Antonio Totonno Pero, began making pizza for the store to sell that same year. The price for a pizza was five cents, but since many people could not afford the cost of a whole pie, they would instead say how much they could pay and they were given a slice corresponding to the amount offered. In 1924, Totonno left Lombardi's to open his own pizzeria on Coney Island called Totonno's. While the original Lombardi's closed its doors in 1984, it was reopened in 1994 just down the street and is run by Lombardi's grandson.\n\nPizza was brought to the Trenton area of New Jersey with Joe's Tomato Pies opening in 1910, followed soon by Papa's Tomato Pies in 1912. In 1936, De Lorenzo's Tomato Pies was opened. While Joe's Tomato Pies has closed, both Papa's and Delorenzo's have been run by the same families since their openings and remain among the most popular pizzas in the area. Frank Pepe Pizzeria Napoletana in New Haven, Connecticut, was another early pizzeria which opened in 1925 (after the owner served pies from local carts and bakeries for 20–25 years) and is famous for its New Haven–style Clam Pie. Frank Pepe's nephew Sal Consiglio opened a competing store, Sally's Apizza, on the other end of the block, in 1938. Both establishments are still run by descendants of the original family. When Sal died, over 2,000 people attended his wake, and \"The New York Times\" ran a half-page memoriam. The D'Amore family introduced pizza to Los Angeles in 1939.\n\nBefore the 1940s, pizza consumption was limited mostly to Italian immigrants and their descendants. The international breakthrough came after World War II. Allied troops occupying Italy, weary of their rations, were constantly on the lookout for good food. They discovered the pizzeria and local bakers were hard-pressed to satisfy the demand from the soldiers. The American troops involved in the Italian campaign took their appreciation for the dish back home, touted by \"veterans ranging from the lowliest private to Dwight D. Eisenhower\". By the 1960s, it was popular enough to be featured in an episode of \"Popeye the Sailor\".\n\nTwo entrepreneurs, Ike Sewell and Ric Riccardo, invented Chicago-style deep-dish pizza, in 1943. They opened their own restaurant on the corner of Wabash and Ohio, Pizzeria Uno.\n\nChain restaurants sprang up with pizza's popularity rising. Leading early pizza chains were Shakey's Pizza, founded in 1954 in Sacramento, California; Pizza Hut, founded in 1958 in Wichita, Kansas; and Josey's Pizza founded in Newnan, Georgia, in 1943. Later entrant restaurant chains to the dine-in pizza market were Bertucci's, Happy Joe's, Monical's Pizza, California Pizza Kitchen, Godfather's Pizza, and Round Table Pizza.\n\n\n"}

Accounts of cannibalism date back as far as Biblical times, and some anthropologists suggest that cannibalism was common in human societies as early as the Paleolithic Era. Historically, numerous tribal societies have engaged in cannibalism, although very few are thought to continue the practice to this day.\n\nOccasionally, starving people have resorted to cannibalism for survival necessity. Classical antiquity recorded numerous references to cannibalism during siege starvations. More recent well-documented examples include the \"Essex\" sinking in 1820, the Donner Party in 1846 and 1847, and the Uruguayan Air Force Flight 571. Some murderers, such as Albert Fish, Boone Helm, Andrei Chikatilo, and Jeffrey Dahmer, are known to have devoured their victims after killing them. Other individuals, such as artist Rick Gibson and journalist William Seabrook, have legally consumed human flesh out of curiosity, or to attract attention to themselves.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "10021492", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=10021492", "title": "Loxoscelism", "text": "Loxoscelism\n\nLoxoscelism () is a condition occasionally produced by the bite of the recluse spiders (genus \"Loxosceles\"). The area becomes dusky and a shallow open sore forms as the skin around the bite dies (necrosis). It is the only proven type of necrotic arachnidism in humans. While there is no known therapy effective for loxoscelism, there has been research on antibiotics, surgical timing, hyperbaric oxygen, potential antivenoms and vaccines. Because of the number of diseases that may mimic loxoscelism, it is frequently misdiagnosed by physicians.\n\nLoxoscelism was first described in the United States in 1879 in Tennessee. Although there are up to 13 different \"Loxosceles\" species in North America (11 native and two nonnative), \"Loxosceles reclusa\" is the species most often involved in serious envenomation. \"Loxosceles reclusa\" has a limited habitat that includes the Southeast United States. In South America, \"L. laeta\", \"L. intermedia\" (found in Brazil and Argentina), and \"L. gaucho\" (Brazil) are the three species most often reported to cause necrotic bites.\n\nLoxoscelism may present with local and whole-body symptoms:\n\n\n\"Loxosceles\" venom has several toxins; the most important for necrotic arachnidism is the enzyme sphingomyelinase D. It is present in all recluse species to varying degrees and not all are equivalent. This toxin is present in only one other known spider genus (\"Sicarius\"). The toxin dissolves the structural components of the cell membrane generating ring forms that perhaps act as a trigger for cellular self-destruction. The area of destruction is limited to the presence of the enzyme which cannot reproduce.\n\nThe spider biting apparatus is short and bites are only possible in experimental animals with pressure on the spider's back. Thus many bites occur when a spider is trapped in a shirt or pant sleeve. There is no commercial chemical test to determine if the venom is from a brown recluse. The bite itself is not usually painful. Many necrotic lesions are erroneously attributed to the bite of the brown recluse. (See Note). Skin wounds are common and infections will lead to necrotic wounds. Thus many terrible skin infections are attributed falsely to the brown recluse. Many suspected bites occurred in areas outside of its natural habitat. A wound found one week later may be misattributed to the spider. The diagnosis is further complicated by the fact that no attempt is made to positively identify the suspected spider. Because of this, other, non-necrotic species are frequently mistakenly identified as a brown recluse. Several certified arachnologists are able to positively identify a brown recluse specimen on request.\n\nReports of presumptive brown recluse spider bites reinforce improbable diagnoses in regions of North America where the spider is not endemic such as Florida, Pennsylvania, and California.\n\nThe mnemonic \"NOT RECLUSE\" has been suggested as a tool to help professionals more objectively exclude skin lesions that were suspected to be loxosceles.\nNumerous (should be solitary), Occurrence (wrong geography) Timing (wrong season), Red Center (center should be black), Elevated (should be shallow depression), Chronic, Large (more than 10 cm), Ulcerates too quickly (less than a week), Swollen, Exudative (there should be no pus, it should be dry)\n\nDespite being one of the few medically important spider bites, there is no established treatment for the bite of a Loxosceles spider. Physicians wait for the body to heal itself, and assist with cosmetic appearance. There are, however, some remedies currently being researched.\n\nAnti-venoms are commercially prepared antibodies to toxins in animal bites. They are specific for each bite. There are several anti-venoms commercially available in Brazil, which have been shown to be effective in controlling the spread of necrosis in rabbits. When administered immediately, they can almost entirely neutralize any ill effects. If too much time is allowed to pass, the treatment becomes ineffective. Most victims do not seek medical attention within the first twelve hours of being bitten, and these anti-venoms are largely ineffective after this point. Because of this, anti-venoms are not being developed more widely. They have, however, been proven to be very effective if administered in a timely manner and could be utilized in Brazil as a legitimate technique.\n\nIn cases where a large dermonecrotic lesion has developed, the dead tissue can be surgically removed. Skin grafting may ultimately be needed to cover this defect.\n\nIt is suspected that most if not all species of the genus \"Loxosceles\" have necrotic venom. Over fifty species have been identified in the genus, but significant research has only been conducted on species living in close proximity to humans.\n\nAmong the spiders bearing necrotic venom, the Brown Recluse is the most commonly encountered by humans. The range of the brown recluse spider extends from southeastern Nebraska to southernmost Ohio and south into Georgia and most of Texas. It can be distinguished by violin shaped markings on its back. The long spindly (\"haywire\") legs have no spines or banding pattern. The brown recluse has six eyes, arranged in pairs, an uncommon arrangement but not exclusive. However, many lesser known species of the Loxosceles genus are believed to have similar venoms. \"L. reclusa\" is a very non-aggressive species. There have been documented cases where a house has a very large population for many years without any of the human inhabitants being bitten. For this reason, \"L. reclusa\" bites are relatively rare, but, because its range overlaps human habitation, its bite is the cause of loxoscelism in North America.\n\n\"Loxosceles laeta\", commonly known as the Chilean Recluse Spider, is generally considered to be one of the most toxic species in the Loxosceles genus. It has a very wide range, having populations in Guatemala, Panama, Curaçao, Trinidad, Venezuela, Colombia, Ecuador, Peru, Bolivia, Chile and Argentina in South and Central America. In North America, there are populations in Vancouver, Canada, Massachusetts, California, Kansas and Florida. \"L. laeta\" can also be found in Finland and Australia. \"L. laeta\" has been documented at elevations between 200m and 2340m. This range can probably be attributed to the species ability to last long periods of time without food or water. The laeta is cryptozoic, meaning it lives in dark concealed places. This can often mean piles of wood or brick for the laeta, facilitating more transportation of the species into new areas. Another reason for the laeta’s strong populations is the high fertility rate among its females. Each female can produce up to fifteen egg sacs in its life, with between fifty and one hundred and fifty eggs in each. Loxosceles laeta eggs have a high egg fertility index.\n\n\"L. deserta\" is found in the Southwest United States. Human interactions with it are rare, because it usually is only found in native vegetation. It is not usually found within heavily populated areas, but its range does come near these areas. It is considered medically unimportant due to the low likelihood of human-to-spider encounters.\n\nThe white-tailed spider, found principally in Australia, was formerly blamed for a series of illnesses including necrotic arachnidism. This used to be part of academic and popular belief, but several reviews of the data have dispelled this myth.\n\n\"Cheiracanthium inclusum\", also known as the Black-Footed Yellow Sac spider, has been implicated in necrotic skin lesions. \"C. inclusum's\" venom has been claimed to be weakly necrotic, but arachnologists contest this assertion. This spider can be found all over North, Central, and South America, as well as in The West Indies. It is often encountered by people indoors and outdoors alike.\n\nMany necrotic lesions in the northwestern United States have been attributed to spider bite. The Centers for Disease Control made a survey as brown recluses are not found in the Pacific Northwest. However, there is a large population of the \"E. agrestis\". This fact has led many to believe that the bite of the Hobo Spider is also necrotic. Critics note that this evidence is only circumstantial. The species is of European origin and never known to have caused such effects over the hundreds of years that it has been known by, interacted with, and bitten people. Claims of a medically significant bite should be regarded as a myth.\n\nOne of the pioneers in antivenom studies in Brazil in the 1920s first focused on \"Lycosa\" species as causes for illness and widespread necrotic lesions. This belief lasted for 50 years until the wolf spider was exonerated.\n\n"}

Raymond Knighton, the first Executive director of the Christian Medical and Dental Society (CMDS). MAP International is a member of Integral, an international cooperation of 19 Christian aid organizations. MAP International’s first project was to supply Shering Corporation and Eli Lilly’s donation of 11 tons of medicines abroad in developing areas. \n\nSince then, MAP International has instituted numerous projects including but not limited to emergency relief efforts after Typhoon Gloria in Taiwan, civilian casualties in Panama, the fall of the Soviet Union, Hurricane Mitch in Honduras, the fall of the Taliban, Hurricanes Katrina and Rita, the 2010 Haiti earthquake, the Ebola outbreak in West Africa, the 2015 Nepal earthquake, the 2016 Ecuador earthquake, and Zika relief in Latin America. MAP International also started Fellowship programs to train medical students, opened offices in developing areas such as Ecuador, Kenya, and West Africa, and donated billions of dollars in medicines and supplies to people in need.\n\nMAP's Mission | MAP International is a global Christian health and relief organization that partners with people living in conditions of poverty to save lives and develop healthier families and communities. Recognized for our 99% efficiency rating, we respond to the needs of those we serve by providing medicines, preventing disease and promoting health to create real hope and lasting change. Our mission is to advance the Total Health of people living in the world’s poorest communities. We carry out that mission in the broad programmatic areas of community health development, disease prevention and eradication, relief and rehabilitation and global health advocacy. Although MAP International is a Christian organization, it has a policy against discrimination based on religion, gender, race, and other aspects of an individual’s background, and will not refuse help to anyone based on these classifications.\n\nMAP International’s status as a highly credible organization is well attested to by multiple well-known sources. Forbes, Inc. recognizes MAP International as the #37 Largest U.S. Charity. This shows that the MAP International program is very well recognized and generates a large amount of revenue. It illuminates important aspects of the program such as its donor dependency, total revenue, amount spent on charitable work, and fundraising efficiency. BBB lists MAP International as an accredited charity, meaning it meets the standards in terms of governance, measuring effectiveness, finances, and fund raising and information. Charity Navigator rates MAP International as 100 out of 100, and four out of four stars, and includes information about the program’s accountability and transparency. CNBC named MAP International #2 on their list of Top-Ten Charities Changing the World in 2015. Popline points out that some health workers have biases against working with faith-based programs, but that the merits of the MAP International program should dispel these biases. It also discusses the financial benefits of FBOs in relation to “their ability to leverage volunteer work with minimal effort.”\n\nMAP International works to respond to both natural and conflict related emergencies. MAP International provides medical relief shipments to those in need and monitors the health of those in need, if an emergency occurs in a country MAP International has instituted a country presence it implements a country office response in which MAP International staff mobilize to provide health care, and utilizes community based disaster mitigation to train community members to manage the effects of the disaster and promote health in the wake of the disaster on a long-term scale. Current MAP International disaster relief programs include Typhoon Haiyan: Philippines, Cyclone Phailin, Oklahoma Tornado, and Syrian Refugee relief. MAP International has responded to Typhoon Haiyan by shipping $4.2 million in medicines and supplies, and is still in the process of responding by providing emergency health care kits to victims. MAP International recognizes its partners for their integral role in efficiently distributing donated medicines and supplies, and states the difficulties they have encountered in getting the medicines to the victims. For example, all of the medicine shipments in Leyte Island were washed away when the typhoon hit that area. In response to the detrimental effects of Cyclone Phailin, MAP International is providing India with temporary shelter structures, food, medicine, and cooking utensils. MAP International has responded to the Oklahoma Tornado by donating over $127,000 of supplies to their partner, Convoy of Hope, in Oklahoma. The U.S. Chamber of Commerce Foundation also mentions MAP International's affiliation with Abbott in response to the tornado. In response to the civil war in Syria, MAP International has sent two shipments to refugees, and is still responding by preparing a third shipment to send when sufficient funding is acquired. The Saporta Report outlines MAP International's involvement in Syrian Refugee Crisis relief efforts, and briefly describes the cost of these emergency aid kits.\n\nA program to turn short-term missions into long-term local health programs.\n\nMedical or non-medical volunteers from the United States help with an existing program in a Total Health Village, assisted by members of MAP International.\n\nShort-term field study for students integrated into the curriculum of a scholastic establishment for credit within the degree areas of health or international development.\n\nOpportunity for fourth year medical students to work during an 8-week program in a MAP-approved hospital or clinic, usually in Kenya, Uganda, Ecuador, Honduras, Bolivia, Indonesia, Liberia, Cote d’Ivore, or Ghana.\n\nVolunteers are educated about a MAP Internal program and work with members of an underserved community to explore ways to collaborate with MAP International programs.\n\nEmergency aid teams from the United States respond quickly to help affected communities by implementing disaster management strategies and training community members to sustain these programs on a long-term basis.\n\nMAP International contributes over $250 million inexpensive bought and donated medicines and supplies to philanthropic relief organizations helping underserved communities each year. The medicines provided are from the Essential Drug List (EDL).\n\nMAP International has implemented programs in Ecuador, Uganda, Kenya, and Bolivia. These programs focus on a plethora of different topics including perinatal care, training health promoters, preventing sexual abuse, providing rehabilitation for victims of sexual abuse, and education.\n\nMAP International has implemented programs in Kenya, Uganda, Ecuador, Honduras, Bolivia, Indonesia, Liberia, Cote d’Ivore, and Ghana to treat and prevent Guinea worm, Buruli ulcer, Leprosy, Yaws, Lymphatic filariasis, Chagas Disease, Soil-transmitted Helminthes, and Rabies. Programs to eradicate these diseases include vaccinations, education, water and sanitation efforts, awareness building, community mobilization, and operations.\n\nMAP International has implemented programs in 65 villages throughout Kenya, Uganda, Ecuador, Honduras, Bolivia, Indonesia, Liberia, Cote d’Ivore, and Ghana to encourage and equip underserved communities to come up with their own innovative solutions to the daily challenges they face. This program focuses on local solutions to problems within the cultural context of the community and is designed to give the community command of the improvement plan. Community members take part in many aspects of other current projects listed such as water and sanitation efforts and disease treatment, as well as working to settle conflict, train local health promoters, and facilitate economic security.\n\nWater and Sanitation are aspects assimilated into all MAP International programs because of the significant impact they have on preventing disease and promoting other facets of Total Health. Water and Sanitation efforts involve building separate waste and clean drinking structures, providing water filters to communities, and establishing Community Led Total Sanitation programs. MAP International utilizes a sweat equity design to implement Sawyer water filters in underserved communities and implements a small-scale demonstration with the help of a few members in the community before introducing water sanitation efforts on a large-scale throughout the village. Sawyer attests to the integral role MAP International has played in distributing hundreds water filters to communities. Community Led Total Sanitation programs are designed to educate and empower local community members to make their village a more sanitary and healthy environment through education about the negative health effects of drinking unclean water and the importance of separating human waste structures and drinking water structures.\n"}

It holds the contracts for GPs and NHS dentists. The Secretary of State publishes, annually, a document known as the mandate which specifies the objectives which the Board should seek to achieve. National Health Service (Mandate Requirements) Regulations are published each year to give legal force to the mandate.\n\nNHS England employs around 6,500 staff in 50 sites around England. Most of its staff previously worked for the decommissioned primary care trusts and strategic health authorities.\n\nIn 2018 it became clear that the organisation, while maintaining its statutory independence, was for practical to be merged with NHS Improvement, and seven “single integrated regional teams” would be jointly established.\n\nNHS England is the operating name of the NHS Commissioning Board and, before that, the NHS Commissioning Board Authority. It was set up as a special health authority of the NHS in October 2011 as the forerunner to becoming an NDPB on 1 April 2013. It was renamed NHS England on 26 March 2013. Its legal name remains the NHS Commissioning Board.\n\nSir David Nicholson who became Chief Executive at the establishment of the Board retired at the end of March 2014 and was replaced by Simon Stevens. One of Stevens' first acts was to announce a restructure of its 27 area teams in response to a requirement to reduce running costs which would reduce staffing by around 500. The 27 teams outside London were reduced to 12 in 2015.\n\nIt produced a planning document the Five Year Forward View in October 2014 which envisaged development of new models to suit local needs. \n\nNHS England in conjunction with the other central regulators established what is called a \"success regime\" in south and mid Essex, North Cumbria and north east and western Devon in June 2015. It is intended to tackle “deep rooted and systemic issues that previous interventions have not tackled across [a] whole health and care economy”.\n\nIn 2016 it organised the geographical division of England into 44 Sustainability and transformation plan areas with populations between 300,000 and 3 million. These areas were locally agreed between NHS Trusts, local authorities and Clinical Commissioning Groups. A leader was appointed for each area, who is to be responsible for the implementation of the plans which are to be agreed by the component organisations. They will be \"working across organisational boundaries to help build a consensus for transformation and the practical steps to deliver it\".\n\nIn April 2017 it introduced a Capped Expenditure Process applied to NHS commissioners and providers in the 13 areas across England with the largest budget deficits. It is intended to reduce their spending by around £500 million, and health leaders were told to ‘think the unthinkable’.\n\nIn October 2016 it introduced a new system for the management of operational difficulties in English hospitals, replacing the rather poorly defined system of red and black alerts which were locally defined. There are 4 OPEL levels. Level 1 is a state of normality. Level 4 is a major crisis requiring external intervention either regionally or nationally. This is intended, among other things, to enable comparisons of trends over time and between different areas. \n\nApplications by GPs to reduce their catchment area are dealt with by NHS England. Requests to reduce the number of patients eligible to join a practice and in some cases also to deregister existing patients, have risen with 26 made between April and October 2014 compared to 30 for the whole of 2013/14. Only 15 have been approved.\n\nIn November 2014 Mr Justice Popplewell declared that NHS England “has acted unlawfully by reason of its failure to make arrangements for the involvement of patients in primary care commissioning decisions as required by the National Health Service Act 2006”. The case involved the decision to scrap minimum practice income guarantee. Richard Stein, a partner at Leigh Day, said the declaration could mean that patients would have to be involved in discussions on changes to the GP contract.\n\nNHS England awarded a 4-year contract to Capita to become sole provider of administrative services including payment administration, management of medical records, and eligibility lists for practitioners for GPs, opticians and dentists across the UK in June 2015. \n\nSee also General medical services\n\nThe organisation was reported to be developing a strategy to support the use of personal health records in June 2015. This, it is hoped, could achieve up to £3.4 billion in annual efficiency savings by 2020. In April 2016 it published an index of digital maturity, where each of the 239 NHS trusts assessed its own \"readiness\", \"capabilities\" and \"Enabling infrastructure\".\n\nIn 2018 the NHS app was unveiled, with very public backing from Matt Hancock, who presented it as the key a radical overhaul of NHS technology.\n\nSpecialised services are those provided in relatively few hospitals, accessed by comparatively small numbers of patients but with catchment populations of usually more than one million. These services tend to be located in specialised hospital trusts that can recruit a team of staff with the appropriate expertise. NHS England is responsible for commissioning £15.6 billion of specialised services and for dealing with Individual Funding Requests in respect of the specialist services it commissions.\nIt was criticised for delays in deciding on a policy for the prescription of Everolimus in the treatment of tuberous sclerosis. Twenty doctors addressed a letter to the board in support of the charity Tuberous Sclerosis Association saying \"around 32 patients with critical need, whose doctors believe everolimus treatment is their best or only option, have no hope of access to funding. Most have been waiting many months. Approximately half of these patients are at imminent risk of a catastrophic event (renal bleed or kidney failure) with a high risk of preventable death.\" In May 2015 it was reported that Luke Henry and Stephanie Rudwick, the parents of a child suffering from Tuberous Sclerosis were trying to sell their home in Brighton to raise the money to pay for treatment for their daughter Bethany who has tumours on her brain, kidneys and liver and suffers from up to fifty epileptic fits a day.\nIt authorises and pays for treatment of narcolepsy with sodium oxybate by means of individual funding requests on the basis of exceptional circumstances. In May 2016 the High Court ordered NHS England to provide funding to treat a teenager with severe narcolepsy. The judge criticised their “thoroughly bad decision” and “absurd” policy discriminating against the girl when hundreds of other NHS patients already receive the drug. The Department of Health is also paying for the treatment of people whose narcolepsy was caused by the swine flu vaccine Pandemrix in 2009-10 by means of private prescriptions outside the National Health Service.\n\nThe organisation's responsibilities include arbitration in disputes between clinical commissioning groups and NHS trusts.\n\nNHS England allocates funding (of £69.5 billion in 2016/7) to CCGs in accordance with a funding formula.

This problem is connected to several other illnesses and economic costs for the government. The causes for Malta's obesity are various and one of the leading aspects is physical inactivity.\n\nMalta's authorities declare that obesity is one of the major preventable causes of other illnesses and finally, leading to an earlier death. In 2014, with the publication of the Eurostat statistics, Malta's obesity problem caught the national, as well as international attention intensively. In the same year, Malta's Parliamentary Secretary for Health, Mr. Chris Fearne, announced that the government is committed to tackle the prevailing obesity problem in Malta.\n\nMalta appears to be the most obese country within the European Union - according to Eurostat and the World Health Organization.\n\nWith 26% - meaning one out of four adults - being obese, Malta is far ahead on the obesity scale, comparable to other EU countries. For children, the situation is worse in Malta, as 40% of all children are obese there. The prevalence of obesity has increased from 23% in 2002 to 25% in 2015.\n\nIn general, Eurostat bases its obesity observation on a BMI calculation. In regard to this method, the definition of obesity is that a person needs to have a higher BMI of 30 in order to be categorized as obese.\n\nImportant findings of the Eurostat statistics included the systematic difference between men and women concerning the obesity level. The proportion of men being obese, with 28.1%, was much higher than that of women in Malta, with 23.9%. The age also plays an important role in Malta's obesity problem. Whereas only one young adult person out of 10 is considered to be obese in Malta (12%), one out of three older persons in Malta (33.6%) is categorized as obese.\n\nEducation plays a certain role in Malta's obesity problem. In almost every EU member state, the share of obesity decreases with education level. 30.3% of Malta's obese population come from a low education level, and only 15.8% of people with a high education level were being classified as obese.\n\nObesity tends to lead to a number of non-communicable diseases and impacts individuals through a lower quality and length of life. The mental effects of obesity should not be ignored either: depression, discrimination and lower educational attainment are psychological aspects related to the physical negative consequences. Regarding the subsequent illnesses of obesity, the chances of being affected by diabetes type two, high blood pressure, heart diseases, a stroke, as well as some forms of cancer are way higher. Furthermore, there exists evidence that obesity and mortality risks are positively related. Malta, contradictory to this statement, has one of the highest life expectancies within Europe. It's life expectancy at birth was 81.9 years in 2015 and therefore above the EU average of 80.6 years. Nevertheless, cardiovascular diseases remain the leading cause in Malta for men and women. Additionally, death rates from ischaemic heart disease in Malta remain above the EU average, but have shown a relatively consistent downward trend. More than a quarter of all deaths from ischaemic heart disease were premature, occurring in people aged under 75.\n\nBut not only the health and quality of life of individuals is negatively influenced by obesity, the costs associated with obesity are weighting on the shoulders of several stakeholders, inter alia the government and the society at large. Based on the 2015 EHIS results, the cost of obesity in Malta has been estimated at 36.3 million euro. 23.8 million euros are thereby direct costs, divided into primary care, specialist care, hospital care, cost of allied healthcare professionals, pharmaceutical care, weight loss interventions and public interventions. The indirect costs, amounted to 12.5 million euro, consist of absenteeism, presenteeism, government subsidies, forgone earnings and forgone taxes. Different scholars point out a figure of 23.7 million euro for overweight and obesity in Malta, including herewith hospital costs and the cost of visits to general practitioners and specialists. Furthermore, the inability to stop the growing levels of obesity will probably result in a loss up to 90,000 hours of work for Malta due to the connected health complications. Besides, it is also estimated that, if the rising percentages of obesity will not be stopped, the costs of obesity will rise to 41.4 million euro which is equal to 110 euro per capita. In the long term, the figure could even rise to 46.5 million euros by 2050.\n\nFor decades, Malta has been sheltered from the influence of other cultures, but with its entry into the European Union and the growing globalization, Malta became easier to access. This aspect, in turn, led to more trade relations, enhancing its tourism and economic opportunities. Moreover, its culture and lifestyle was equally influenced. It is argued that it is exactly this change of Malta's traditional Mediterranean diet to a high-fat and high-sugar fast food nutrition which is favored by many Western European countries and the United States. When regarding the causes of obesity in general, the major reasons for weight gains include diminished physical activity, high fat diets and inadequate adjustments of energy intakes. On the one hand, it is Malta's extremely westernized diet - which the Mediterranean genes cannot adopt to fastly. On the other hand, it is Malta's lack of physical activity, affecting its obesity rate.\n\nTaking the aspect of physical activity more detailed into account, there can be different layers identified for impacting the physical activity of a country. There exist natural,- built,- and social environment factors, as well as individual determinants.\n\nOne factor influencing Malta's physical inactivity plays its built environment, meaning its urban design and its infrastructure. Infrastructure which is designed to encourage physical activity, such as the construction of bike lanes, diminishes obesity. Malta has the highest motorisation rate among any region from one of the Member States that joined the EU in 2004 or more recently. Following this argument, its motorisation rate consisted of 592 passenger cars per thousand inhabitants in 2012. There are usual smaller EU countries which are having the highest motorisation rates: Luxembourg makes the first place with 661 passenger cars per 1000 inhabitants, whereas Malta follows directly with 634 cars per 1000 inhabitants.\n\nNext to the built environment, it is the social environment which influences the physical activity of a country. In this respect, the income factor is decisive. There exist a definite correlation between physical inactivity and a low level of income. With 11 billion euro, Malta has the lowest GDP ration as country in 2017, compared to the other EU countries. When looking at the GDP per inhabitant (in accordance with the Purchasing Power Standards), Malta belongs with 27,500 euro to the lowest quarter of the EU countries. Luxembourg, with 75,000, is the country with the highest GDP per inhabitant. Malta's comparably low income level explains partly its physical inactivity and its high obesity rate.\n\nThe individual determinant includes the education factor. It is a concern that people with a lower education status are more prone to be less physcially active, since these groups have less leisure time or poorer access to recreation and sport facilities. With 18.6%, Malta has the highest percentage of all EU countries regarding early leavers from education (aged 18–24). Malta's low committment to exercise is also based on its general low education level.\n\nEspecially since 2014, when the statistics about Malta being the most obese country, got published, Malta's government tries actively to tackle to obesity issue. Childhood obesity in particular is one of its major concerns: Kindergarten children learn how to prepare healthy foods and shops in schools are allowed to sell only products the Maltese authorities consider as healthy. In general, Malta's government launched several initiatives in order to reduce obesity. One of the them is the 'Healthy Weight for Life strategy for 2012-2020, which aims to establish a society in which health lifestyles related to diet and physical activity become the norm and health choices are easy and accessible to all. Furthermore, Malta published the \"Food and Nutrition Policy and Action Plan for Malta 2015-2020\".\n"}

It brings together some 450 representatives each year.\nThe results of the conference are summarized in the \"British Journal of Ophthalmology\". and also, where useful to the wider profession, in the \"British Medical Journal\".\n\nIn 1902, Robert Walter Doyne was appointed the first Reader in Ophthalmology at the University of Oxford. The post was inaugurated thanks to a benefaction from Mrs. Margaret Ogilvie. Doyne held the chair for 11 years and was also consulting ophthalmic surgeon to the Radcliffe Infirmary in Oxford. He later founded the Oxford Eye Hospital.\n\nIn 1904 he was the lead representative for Ophthalmology at the annual meeting of the British Medical Association (BMA), which was held at Oxford in the summer. This programme was such a success that he was asked to arrange a similar meeting the following year and this then became a regular event each summer. \n\nAs a result, the Oxford Ophthalmological Congress was formally established in 1909, and Doyne was appointed its first Master the following year. \n\nIn 2014 Parul Desai became the first woman to be appointed Master, with the original title being maintained.\n\nThe Congress is a 3-day colloquium, held each July in Oxford in England, at which leading practitioners give talks on issues of interest to the profession. The main event of the Congress is the Doyne Memorial Lecture, but there are, in addition, opportunities for a number of quick-fire presentations, allowing newcomers to introduce themselves and their projects to a distinguished gathering of professional colleagues. The Founder's Cup is awarded for the best presentation and the Ian Fraser Cup is the other main award. The evenings are for socialising: an opportunity to catch up with old colleagues from other universities and hospitals, and a chance for the present and the future of the profession to meet each other.\n\nThe Founder's Cup is the leading prize of the Congress and a fair indicator of the leading British-trained ophthalmologists of the future:\n\nThe other main award of the Congress is the Ian Fraser Cup.\n\n"}

Super Slow is Hutchins trademarked name for the High intensity training approach advocated by Arthur Jones. It is based on ideas from the 1940s and 1960s called 10/10 \"muscle contraction with measured movement\" and implemented using fixed weight Nautilus machines. In more recent times such \"Time Under Load\" ideas have seen a renaissance with Dr Doug McGuff's best selling Body by Science.\n\nThe 10 second lifting, 10 second lowering repetition speed of movement was suggested to Ken Hutchins by Dr. Vincent Bocchicchio. Bocchicchio promoted his original idea as being impractical on compound movements such as leg press, chest press, overhead press, and pull downs (chin-ups). However, Hutchins developed a turnaround technique to include those important exercises during Nautilus-funded osteoporosis research at the University of Florida in the early 1980s. In addition, Hutchins improved the resistance curves of the exercise equipment and reduced their friction to further enhance the loading effect upon the muscles. The effect of this approach was further improved by the practice of the exercises in an \"ideal\" environment wherein the temperature was cool, ventilation was provided, and distractions (audio, smell, visual) were minimized. This clinical environment, in combination with the slow speed and improved mechanics, had never been managed before. SuperSlow instructors are also educated with an emphasis on using precise language in exercise.\n\nA ten/ten protocol was used in the 1940s by body builders and later in the 1960s by powerlifters as a plateau breaker under the name MC/MM or \"muscle contraction with measured movement\". This similar idea was sometimes advocated by Bob Hoffman of the York Barbell Company. None of these earlier approaches incorporated the ideal environment, the consistent turnaround technique, the superior equipment mechanics, nor the adherence to tracking muscular function that SuperSlow encompassed.\n\nThe method incorporates very slow repetition speeds as compared to traditional resistance training methods, with emphasis on minimizing acceleration and momentum to reduce the force the body is exposed to during exercise and improve muscular loading.\n\nSuperSlow workouts typically consist of one set of each exercise carried out to complete muscle fatigue. Hutchins recommends performing each set for between 100 and 240 seconds, depending on the exercise and the subject's competence. A frequency of twice weekly is recommended for most trainees, with even less frequency for more advanced trainees. A workout should last no longer than 30 minutes and be performed to the exclusion of all other intense activity for maximum progress. In recent years, Hutchins has continued to refine methods and expand publications to include additional training methodology and exercise history.)\n\nSome research indicates that Super Slow produces superior results compared to traditional methods in as little as 10 weeks.\n\nSlow repetitions may be particularly beneficial to trainees working around injuries or conditions requiring extra caution and may be useful for practicing proper form when learning new exercises. Personal trainers who have abandoned Super Slow for general use may still use it as a method for teaching new exercises or evaluating clients' exercise form.\n\nSimilar methods include Fred Hahn's Slow Burn system and Adam Zickerman's Power of 10 method. Zickerman's Power of Ten is identical to Super Slow in rep speed and philosophy. Hahn's Slow Burn method does not subscribe to the strict 10/10 rep tempo, and uses a heavier weight load than Super Slow. In Slow Burn training, the weight load chosen renders muscle fatigue in 40–90 seconds. Hahn also recommends two sessions per week for the vast majority of trainees. The word \"burn\" in Slow Burn is used to describe efficient fat burning via the use of a low carbohydrate eating regimen, NOT the feeling of burning muscles while doing the exercises.\n\n\n"}

Tobacco laws and regulations are controlled by the Ministry of Health of Armenia. Armenian men tend to be the most common tobacco users, as 42.5% of men over the age of 15 smoke.\n\nAccording to the World Health Organization (WHO) the three leading health risk factors in Armenia are: “alcohol use, road traffic injuries, and tobacco use.” Armenia Ranks first in Europe and sixth in the world with more than 70% of the population being cigarette smokers. In 2004, Armenia joined the WHO’s Framework Convention on Tobacco Control (FCTC) and the National Tobacco Program was approved by Armenia’s Parliament. A bill was proposed to abolish the promotion and sale of tobacco products to minors, ban smoking in public places (such as universities and hospitals), enforce stricter regulations on tobacco companies and raise prices on all tobacco products to promote healthy lifestyles among all individuals in the country.\n\nThe first “National Tobacco Control Law on Tobacco Realization, Consumption, Production and Usage Limitations” was signed into law in 2005 by President Robert Kocharyan. Although the law is in place to prohibit smoking in public places, regulate distribution of cigarettes by manufacturers, improve public health and awareness of the health hazards of smoking lack of enforcement has rendered this law to be unsuccessful.\n\nTobacco use in Armenia is most commonly seen in men, although, over the years, women have started to smoke cigarettes as well, allowing for the emergence of a new market directed towards female smokers. According to the most recent WHO reports, an estimated 52.5% of men 1.5% of women over the age of 15 are smokers. With smoking gaining popularity among women, tobacco companies are given an opportunity for a new market targeting female smokers. Large tobacco companies produce thin, colored, menthol flavored cigarettes especially designed for female smokers. Although there is a ban on the sale and advertisement of tobacco products to those who are underage (under the age of 18) adolescents have also began smoking at higher rates, starting as young as thirteen years of age due to a lack of enforcement of this ban. This increasing trend in cigarette smoke has led to major health risks such as various lung diseases, risk of heart attacks, an increased risk of malignant tumors and allergies.\n\nPer the FCTC’s requirements the 2005 law that was signed by President Kocharyan also imposed regulations on public advertisement of tobacco products and proposed a complete ban of advertisements by 2010. According to the FCTC’s requirements the law also mandated proper labeling of cigarette packs to inform the public about the health risks associated with smoking. The warning label on cigarette packs reads “Smoking is Hazardous Health” and serves as a warning label for smokers.\n\nThe is in control of laws and regulations associated with tobacco use. As of 2016 the current minister of the department is Levon Altunyan.

Historically, it was cultivated primarily in Thrace and Macedonia, now divided among Bulgaria, Greece, the Republic of Macedonia and Turkey, but it is now also grown on the Black Sea coast of Turkey, in Egypt, in South Africa and elsewhere.\n\nThe name \"Turkish\" refers to the Ottoman Empire, which ruled the historic production areas until the late 19th/early 20th century.\n\nTobacco originated in the Americas and was introduced to the Ottoman Turks by the Spanish. The Ottoman people over time developed their own method of growing and using tobacco.\n\nMany of the early brands of cigarettes were made mostly or entirely of Turkish tobacco; today, its main use is in blends of pipe and especially cigarette tobacco.\n\nTurkish tobacco is sun-cured, which makes it more aromatic and, like flue-cured tobacco, more acidic than air or smoke-cured tobacco, thus more suitable for cigarette production.\n\nTurkish tobacco has a much milder flavour and contains less nicotine and fewer carcinogens than other varieties. Cigarettes containing only Turkish tobacco, like Murad, Helmar, Balkan Sobranie or those supplied by urban tobacconists like Fribourg & Treyer or Sullivan Powell in London, are no longer available. Blends, however, persist: the American Blend cigarette, in particular, uses Turkish mixed with more robust tobacco such as Virginia tobacco and Burley. Turkish tobacco plants usually have a greater number and smaller size leaves. These differences can be attributed to climate, soil, cultivation and treatment methods.\n\n\"Balkan Smoke: Tobacco and the Making of Modern Bulgaria\" by Mary Neuburger offers a comprehensive history of Oriental tobacco in the Balkans and how it came to dominate global markets in the 1960s.\n"}

Poland (Application no. 5410/03) was a case decided by the European Court of Human Rights (ECtHR) in 2007. A pregnant woman from Poland, diagnosed with a severe eye disease, tried to get an abortion to avoid an escalation of her disease. Her requests were rejected by several medical doctors and she underwent labor of her third child. Her condition later deteriorated, and she sued one of the doctors. Her criminal lawsuits were rejected in Poland and the case was appealed to the European Court of Human Rights, which accepted one part of the complaint, and the plaintiff was awarded damages.\n\nMs. A. Tysiąc suffered from severe myopia. During her third pregnancy in 2000, she was examined by three ophthalmologists. All of them concluded that, due to pathological changes in her retina, the pregnancy and delivery constituted a risk to her eyesight. However, they refused to issue a certificate for the pregnancy to be terminated, despite Tysiąc's requests, saying that the risk of the retina detaching itself due to the strain caused by giving birth could be avoided if Mrs. Tysiąc delivered through cesarean section. Subsequently, Ms. Tysiąc sought further medical advice. A general practitioner (GP) issued a certificate stating that the third pregnancy constituted a threat to Ms. Tysiąc's health as there was a risk of rupture of the uterus, given her two previous deliveries by caesarean section. She further referred to Ms. Tysiąc's short-sightedness and to significant pathological changes in her retina. These considerations, according to the GP, also required that Ms. Tysiąc should avoid physical strain which in any case would hardly be possible as at that time the applicant was raising two small children on her own. Ms. Tysiąc understood that on the basis of this certificate she would be able to terminate her pregnancy lawfully.\n\nSubsequently, Ms. Tysiąc contacted a state hospital, the Clinic of Gynaecology and Obstetrics in Warsaw, in the area to which she was assigned on the basis of her residence, with a view to obtaining the termination of her pregnancy. On 26 April 2000 she had an appointment with Dr R.D., head of the Gynaecology and Obstetrics Department of the Clinic. Dr R.D. examined her, but did not examine her ophthalmological records. Afterwards, he made a note on the back of the certificate issued by the GP that neither her short-sightedness nor her two previous deliveries by caesarean section constituted grounds for therapeutic termination of the pregnancy. He was of the view that, in these circumstances, the applicant should give birth by caesarean section. During the applicant's visit Dr R.D. also consulted an endocrinologist.\n\nAs a result, Ms. Tysiąc's pregnancy was not terminated. She delivered the child by caesarean section in November 2000.\n\nSome time after the delivery, her eyesight deteriorated. On 11 January 2001 the social welfare centre issued a certificate to the effect that she was unable to take care of her children as she could not see from a distance of more than 1.5 metres.\n\nMs. Tysiąc lodged a criminal complaint against Dr R.D., alleging that he had prevented her from having her pregnancy terminated on medical grounds as recommended by the GP and permissible as one of the exceptions to a general ban on abortion. She complained that, following the pregnancy and delivery, she had sustained severe bodily harm by way of almost complete loss of her eyesight. The investigation of the applicant's complaint was carried out by the Warsaw-Śródmieście District Prosecutor. The prosecutor heard evidence from the ophthalmologists who had examined the applicant during her pregnancy. They stated that she could have had a safe delivery by caesarean section. The prosecutor further requested the preparation of an expert report by a panel of three medical experts (ophthalmologist, gynaecologist and specialist in forensic medicine) from the Białystok Medical Academy. According to the report, the applicant's pregnancies and deliveries had not affected the deterioration of her eyesight. Given the serious nature of the applicant's sight impairment, the risk of retinal detachment had always been present and continued to exist, and the pregnancy and delivery had not contributed to increasing that risk. Furthermore, the experts found that in the applicant's case there had been no factors militating against the applicant's carrying her baby to term and delivering it.\n\nThe criminal investigation against Dr R.D. was therefore discontinued.\n\nBy 6 votes to 1, the court held that there was a violation of Article 8 ECHR (right to private life), as \"\"it is not the Court's task in the present case to examine whether the Convention guarantees a right to have an abortion\" and \"it has not been demonstrated that Polish law as applied to the applicant's case contained any effective mechanisms capable of determining whether the conditions for obtaining a lawful abortion had been met in her case... the provisions of the civil law on tort as applied by the Polish courts did not afford the applicant a procedural instrument by which she could have vindicated her right to respect for her private life. The civil law remedy was solely of a retroactive and compensatory character. It could only, and if the applicant had been successful, have resulted in the courts granting damages to cover the irreparable damage to her health which had come to light after the delivery... Crucially, the examination of the circumstances of the case in the context of criminal investigations could not have prevented the damage to the applicant's health from arising. The same applies to disciplinary proceedings before the organs of the Chamber of Physicians.\"\n\nJudge Borrego Borrego filed a dissenting opinion, concluding that \"the Court has decided that a human being was born as a result of a violation of the European Convention on Human Rights. According to this reasoning, there is a Polish child, currently six years old, whose right to be born contradicts the Convention. I would never have thought that the Convention would go so far, and I find it frightening\". Judge Bonello filed a separate opinion, stating that his vote for finding a violation goes no further than \"whether, in cases of conflicting views (between a pregnant woman and doctors, or between the doctors themselves) as to whether the conditions to obtain a legal abortion were satisfied or not, effective mechanisms capable of determining the issue were in place\".\n\nBesides, the court ruled unanimously that there was no violation of Article 3 (no torture, inhuman or degrading treatment).\n\nMs. Tysiąc was awarded €25000 in respect of non-pecuniary damage and €14000 in respect of costs and expenses.\n\n\n"}

Based in Nevada, Missouri, it was founded by Sidney Abram Weltmer on February 19, 1897 and operated until 1933, being dissolved shortly after his death in 1930.\n\nThe institute was significant in generating business that helped boost the growth of Nevada. But the hypnotic and telepathic healing that it sold was criticized as ineffective voodoo and charlatanry.\n\nSidney Weltmer was an enthusiastic supporter of the idea that healing could be the basis of a successful business. In his book \"How to Make Magnetic Healing Pay\", he had written that \"a thorough knowledge of Magnetic Healing alone will not bring success, financially—a knowledge of the business side of the science is necessary as well\". Weltmer's interests in business culminated in his opening of the Weltmer Institute in Nevada, Missouri in 1897.\n\nAt its height, the institute treated 400 people a day, generating a daily income of $3,600. It employed 17 healers, and more than 100 stenographers and typists to process mail.\n\nAfter the closure of the Institute in 1933, the first building was sold to Milster Funeral Home. In 2005, the historical buildings were razed for the construction of new buildings on the site.\n\nAt the institute, practitioners performed mental healing through telepathy and mental suggestion.\n\nOne practitioner – J.O. Crone – wrote an account of his time at the institute; he claimed that he began work with scant instruction from Weltmer, who had been preoccupied. Crone wrote of his first hypnosis, of a woman patient, thus:\n\nF. H. Behncke wrote in his 1920 book, \"Pioneer Teachers\", that the Weltmer Institute \"may be called the foremost school for mental healing in America\".\n\nThe institute had a significant effect on the town of Nevada, Missouri. It was responsible for such an increase in volume of mail handled by the local post office, that these functions were upgraded to first class and housed in a new building. In addition, other of the town's facilities expanded in response to the business generated by the institute's activities. The railroad company scheduled extra trains to handle the passenger numbers generated by the institute's fame.\n\nWeltmer, and his institute, were attacked by critics. In his booklet of 1900, \"The Exposé of Weltmerism: Magnetic Healing De-magnetized\", Preston W. Pope described what he saw as errors in Welmer's practice; a local pastor referred to Weltmer's practices as \"an ignorant mixture of voodoo and Christian Science\". Iin 1910 issue of the \"British Medical Journal\", Weltmerism was described as \"one of the innumerable freaks of the charlatan fancy which flourished only on American soil.\"\n\n\n\n\n"}
