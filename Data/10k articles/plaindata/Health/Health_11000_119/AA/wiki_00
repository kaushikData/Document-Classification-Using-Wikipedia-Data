{"id": "41932", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=41932", "title": "Accuracy and precision", "text": "Accuracy and precision\n\nPrecision is a description of \"random errors\", a measure of statistical variability.\n\nAccuracy has two definitions:\n\nIn simplest terms, given a set of data points from repeated measurements of the same quantity, the set can be said to be \"precise\" if the values are close to each other, while the set can be said to be \"accurate\" if their average is close to the \"true value\" of the quantity being measured. In the first, more common definition above, the two concepts are independent of each other, so a particular set of data can be said to be either accurate, or precise, or both, or neither.\n\nIn the fields of science and engineering, the accuracy of a measurement system is the degree of closeness of measurements of a quantity to that quantity's true value. The precision of a measurement system, related to reproducibility and repeatability, is the degree to which repeated measurements under unchanged conditions show the same results. Although the two words precision and accuracy can be synonymous in colloquial use, they are deliberately contrasted in the context of the scientific method.\n\nThe field of statistics, where the interpretation of measurements plays a central role, prefers to use the terms \"bias\" and \"variability\" instead of accuracy and precision: bias is the amount of inaccuracy and variability is the amount of imprecision.\n\nA measurement system can be accurate but not precise, precise but not accurate, neither, or both. For example, if an experiment contains a systematic error, then increasing the sample size generally increases precision but does not improve accuracy. The result would be a consistent yet inaccurate string of results from the flawed experiment. Eliminating the systematic error improves accuracy but does not change precision.\n\nA measurement system is considered \"valid\" if it is both \"accurate\" and \"precise\". Related terms include \"bias\" (non-random or directed effects caused by a factor or factors unrelated to the independent variable) and \"error\" (random variability).\n\nThe terminology is also applied to indirect measurements—that is, values obtained by a computational procedure from observed data.\n\nIn addition to accuracy and precision, measurements may also have a measurement resolution, which is the smallest change in the underlying physical quantity that produces a response in the measurement.\n\nIn numerical analysis, accuracy is also the nearness of a calculation to the true value; while precision is the resolution of the representation, typically defined by the number of decimal or binary digits.\n\nIn military terms, accuracy refers primarily to the accuracy of fire (or \"justesse de tir\"), the precision of fire expressed by the closeness of a grouping of shots at and around the centre of the target.\n\nIn industrial instrumentation, accuracy is the measurement tolerance, or transmission of the instrument and defines the limits of the errors made when the instrument is used in normal operating conditions.\n\nIdeally a measurement device is both accurate and precise, with measurements all close to and tightly clustered around the true value. The accuracy and precision of a measurement process is usually established by repeatedly measuring some traceable reference standard. Such standards are defined in the International System of Units (abbreviated SI from French: Système international d'unités) and maintained by national standards organizations such as the National Institute of Standards and Technology in the United States.\n\nThis also applies when measurements are repeated and averaged. In that case, the term standard error is properly applied: the precision of the average is equal to the known standard deviation of the process divided by the square root of the number of measurements averaged. Further, the central limit theorem shows that the probability distribution of the averaged measurements will be closer to a normal distribution than that of individual measurements.\n\nWith regard to accuracy we can distinguish:\n\nA common convention in science and engineering is to express accuracy and/or precision implicitly by means of significant figures. Here, when not explicitly stated, the margin of error is understood to be one-half the value of the last significant place. For instance, a recording of 843.6 m, or 843.0 m, or 800.0 m would imply a margin of 0.05 m (the last significant place is the tenths place), while a recording of 8436 m would imply a margin of error of 0.5 m (the last significant digits are the units).\n\nA reading of 8,000 m, with trailing zeroes and no decimal point, is ambiguous; the trailing zeroes may or may not be intended as significant figures. To avoid this ambiguity, the number could be represented in scientific notation: 8.0 × 10 m indicates that the first zero is significant (hence a margin of 50 m) while 8.000 × 10 m indicates that all three zeroes are significant, giving a margin of 0.5 m. Similarly, it is possible to use a multiple of the basic measurement unit: 8.0 km is equivalent to 8.0 × 10 m. In fact, it indicates a margin of 0.05 km (50 m). However, reliance on this convention can lead to false precision errors when accepting data from sources that do not obey it. For example, a source reporting a number like 153,753 with precision +/- 5,000 looks like it has precision +/- 0.5. Under the convention it would have been rounded to 154,000.\n\nPrecision includes:\n\nA shift in the meaning of these terms appeared with the publication of the ISO 5725 series of standards in 1994, which is also reflected in the 2008 issue of the \"BIPM International Vocabulary of Metrology\" (VIM), items 2.13 and 2.14.\n\nAccording to ISO 5725-1, the general term \"accuracy\" is used to describe the closeness of a measurement to the true value. When the term is applied to sets of measurements of the same \"measure\"and, it involves a component of random error and a component of systematic error. In this case trueness is the closeness of the mean of a set of measurement results to the actual (true) value and precision is the closeness of agreement among a set of results.\n\nISO 5725-1 and VIM also avoid the use of the term \"bias\", previously specified in BS 5497-1, because it has different connotations outside the fields of science and engineering, as in medicine and law.\n\n\"Accuracy\" is also used as a statistical measure of how well a binary classification test correctly identifies or excludes a condition. That is, the accuracy is the proportion of true results (both true positives and true negatives) among the total number of cases examined. To make the context clear by the semantics, it is often referred to as the \"Rand accuracy\" or \"Rand index\". It is a parameter of the test.\nThe formula for quantifying binary accuracy is:\n\nAccuracy = (TP+TN)/(TP+TN+FP+FN)\n\nwhere: TP = True positive; FP = False positive; TN = True negative; FN = False negative\n\nIn psychometrics and psychophysics, the term \"accuracy\" is interchangeably used with validity and \"constant error\". \"Precision\" is a synonym for reliability and \"variable error\". The validity of a measurement instrument or psychological test is established through experiment or correlation with behavior. Reliability is established with a variety of statistical techniques, classically through an internal consistency test like Cronbach's alpha to ensure sets of related questions have related responses, and then comparison of those related question between reference and target population.\n\nIn logic simulation, a common mistake in evaluation of accurate models is to compare a logic simulation model to a transistor circuit simulation model. This is a comparison of differences in precision, not accuracy. Precision is measured with respect to detail and accuracy is measured with respect to reality.\n\nInformation retrieval systems, such as databases and web search engines, are evaluated by many different metrics, some of which are derived from the confusion matrix, which divides results into true positives (documents correctly retrieved), true negatives (documents correctly not retrieved), false positives (documents incorrectly retrieved), and false negatives (documents incorrectly not retrieved). Commonly used metrics include the notions of precision and recall. In this context, precision is defined as the fraction of retrieved documents which are relevant to the query (true positives divided by true+false positives), using a set of ground truth relevant results selected by humans. Recall is defined as the fraction of relevant documents retrieved compared to the total number of relevant documents (true positives divided by true positives+false negatives). Less commonly, the metric of accuracy is used, is defined as the total number of correct classifications (true positives plus true negatives) divided by the total number of documents.\n\nNone of these metrics take into account the ranking of results. Ranking is very important for web search engines because readers seldom go past the first page of results, and there are too many documents on the web to manually classify all of them as to whether they should be included or excluded from a given search. Adding a cutoff at a particular number of results takes ranking into account to some degree. The measure precision at k, for example, is a measure of precision looking only at the top ten (k=10) search results. More sophisticated metrics, such as discounted cumulative gain, take into account each individual ranking, and are more commonly used where this is important.\n\n"}

The dots are short-lived, visible for a second or less, and traveling short distances along seemingly random, curvy paths. Some of them follow the same path as predecessors. The dots may be elongated along the path like tiny worms. The speed of the dots varies in sync with the pulse; they briefly accelerate at each heart beat. The dots appear in the central field of view, within 15 degrees from the fixation point. The left and right eye see different dots; someone looking with both eyes sees a mixture.\n\nMost people are able to see this phenomenon in the sky, although it is rather weak, and many people do not notice it until asked to pay attention. The dots are highly conspicuous against a monochromatic blue background (~430 nm) instead of the sky.\n\nThe dots are white blood cells moving in the capillaries in front of the retina of the eye.\nBlue light (optimal wavelength: 430 nm) is absorbed by the red blood cells that fill the capillaries. The eye and brain \"edit out\" the shadow lines of the capillaries, partially by dark adaptation of the photoreceptors lying beneath the capillaries. The white blood cells, which are much rarer than the red ones and do not absorb blue light, create gaps in the blood column, and these gaps appear as bright dots. The gaps are elongated because a spherical white blood cell is too wide for the capillary. Red blood cells pile up behind the white blood cell, showing up like a dark tail. This behavior of the blood cells in the capillaries of the retina has been directly observed in human subjects by adaptive optics scanning laser ophthalmoscopy, a real time imaging technique for examining retinal blood flow.\nThe dots will not appear at the very centre of the visual field, because there are no blood vessels in the foveal avascular zone.\n\nIn a technique known as blue field entoptoscopy, the effect is used to estimate the blood flow in the retinal capillaries. The patient is alternatingly shown blue light and a computer generated picture of moving dots; by adjusting the speed and density of these dots, the patient tries to match the computer generated picture to the perceived entoptic dots.\n\nScheerer’s phenomenon can be easily distinguished from floaters (\"muscae volitantes\"). \nScheerer’s phenomenon consists of corpuscles of identical diameter and visual sharpness, of a simple dot or worm-like shape, brighter than the background. If the eye stops moving, the dots keep darting around. If the eye moves, the dots follow instantaneously, because they are contained in the retina. In contrast, floaters are specks or threads of variable diameter and variable visual sharpness, some of complex shape, darker than the background. If the eye stops moving, the floaters settle down. If the eye moves, the floaters follow sluggishly, because they are contained in the vitreous humor which is subject to inertia.\n\nScheerer's phenomenon can be distinguished from visual snow because it appears only when looking into bright light, whereas visual snow is constantly present in all light conditions including the dark.\n\n\n"}

Medical use of cannabis was legalized in 2018.\n\nFollowing the Portuguese seizure of Goa in 1510, the Portuguese became familiar with the cannabis customs and trade in India. Garcia da Orta, a botanist and doctor, wrote about the uses of cannabis in his 1534 work \"Colloquies on the Simples and Drugs and Medicinal Matters of India and of a Few Fruits\". Fifteen years later Cristobal Acosta produced the work \"A Tract about the Drugs and Medicines of the East Indies\", outlining recipes for bhang.\n\nThe 1919 work \"Glossário luso-asiatico\" noted the use of cannabis in Portugal's Indian colony of Goa:\n\"O bangue é formado por folhas secas e hastes tentras de cânhamo (Canabis sativa, Lin.) que se fumam o mascam e que embriaga como o ópio.\"\n\nCannabis was introduced to Brazil by the Portuguese colonists in the early 1800s. Their intent may have been to cultivate hemp fiber, but the slaves the Portuguese imported from Africa were familiar with cannabis and used it psychoactively, leading the Municipal Council of Rio de Janeiro in 1830 to prohibit bringing cannabis into the city, and punishing its use by any slave.\n\nPossession of cannabis in Portugal is decriminalized in amounts for personal use, considered to be up to 25 grams of plant material or 5 grams of hashish. In 2001 Portugal decriminalized all illegal drugs, meaning that possession of personal amounts (a 10 day supply) is not subject to any penalties for a first-time offense. Subsequent offenses may be subject to civil penalties or mandated treatment.\n\nIn July 2018, legislation was signed into law to allow for the medical use of cannabis in Portugal and its dispensation at pharmacies. Personal cultivation for medical use remains against the law.\n"}
{"id": "1602860", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1602860", "title": "Canned hunt", "text": "Canned hunt\n\nA canned hunt is a trophy hunt in which an animal is kept in a confined area, such as in a fenced-in area, increasing the likelihood of the hunter obtaining a kill. According to one dictionary, a canned hunt is a \"hunt for animals that have been raised on game ranches until they are mature enough to be killed for trophy collections.\" There have been criticisms of this method of hunting from both hunters and animal welfare advocacy groups. This is also sometimes referred to as vanity hunting.\n\nCanned hunting has been banned or restricted in 20 states of the USA, including Alabama, Arizona, California, Connecticut, Delaware, Georgia, Hawaii, Maryland, Massachusetts, Minnesota, Mississippi, Montana, Nevada, North Carolina, Oregon, Rhode Island, Virginia, Wisconsin, and Wyoming.\n\nIn 2006, Alabama was the most recent state to pass legislation banning many forms of canned hunting. In 2007, a bill in the New York State Legislature to ban all canned hunting of certain \"exotic\" animals was defeated by legislative inaction.\n\nA number of groups object to the practice of canned hunting for reasons such as cruelty to animals or that it takes away what is known as \"fair chase.\"\n\nThe Humane Society of the United States (HSUS) criticizes canned hunting. In a statement, the HSUS called canned hunts \"cruel and brutal activities,\" in which the hunted animal has \"absolutely no chance of escape.\" It went on to say that animals have been \"psychologically conditioned to behave as a target by life in captivity,\" among other objections.\n\nSome hunting groups, especially those who focus on hunters' ethics, also object to canned hunting. These objections are on the grounds of \"fair chase\", the idea that an animal has a fair chance of escaping the hunter, and it's not too easy for the hunter to kill the animal. It is believed that canned hunts remove these elements.\n\nHunting groups such as the Pope and Young Club and the Boone and Crockett Club do not accept animals killed in canned hunts for inclusion in their record books. Boone and Crockett Club refers to the activity as a \"canned shoot\", as they claim that there is no hunting involved.\n\nSafari Club International no longer accepts animals killed in canned hunts for inclusion in its record books and award categories.\n\nIn 2014, 62 cities across the globe participated in the first-ever global march against canned hunting. The march was organized by Campaign Against Canned Hunting. People from many parts of the world took part: Africa, Asia, Australia, Canada, Europe, Middle East, New Zealand, South America and the United States.\n\nIn 2005, internet hunting became a major news story when a man in Texas set up a webcam and remotely controlled gun to allow hunters to shoot from their computers. According to the Humane Society, most internet hunts involve game ranches where animals are kept penned, making them essentially canned hunts.\n\nOn August 15, 2006, Troy Gentry, half of the country music singing duo Montgomery Gentry, appeared in federal court in Duluth, Minnesota charged with canned hunting. Federal prosecutors allege that Gentry bought a bear named \"Cubby\" from Lee Marvin Greenly, then shot the tame bear while it was in an enclosed pen, tagged the bear as if it had been killed in the wild, then arranged for the editing of a videotape of the alleged \"wild\" kill. Gentry and Greenly are said to face a maximum penalty of five years in federal prison and a $20,000 fine if convicted. On November 27, 2006, Gentry pleaded guilty to a charge of falsely tagging the bear. Under the plea agreement, he agreed to pay a $15,000 fine, give up hunting, fishing and trapping in Minnesota for 5 years, and forfeit both the stuffed bear and the bow used to shoot the animal in 2004. Gentry posted a statement on the duo's website on November 9, 2010, apologizing for his actions.\n\nAnother less well-known incident occurred two years prior to the Dick Cheney hunting incident when the vice president participated in a canned hunt at the Rolling Rock Club in Ligonier Township, Pennsylvania. Cheney and nine companions killed 417 out of 500 ringneck pheasants, of which the Vice President himself is credited with killing 70, and an unknown number of mallard ducks.\n\nIn South Africa, the Minister of Environmental Affairs, Mr. Marthinus van Schalkwyk, in 2006, announced new laws to stop the practise of \"canned hunting\" in his country. South Africa environment minister announced long-awaited restrictions on lion hunting, declaring he was sickened by wealthy tourists shooting tame lions from the back of a truck and felling rhinos with a bow and arrow. This comes in response to the imbroglio created over the potential canned hunt of the African rhinoceros 'Baixinha.'\n\nDismissing threats of legal action by the hunting industry, Marthinus Van Schalkwyk said the new law would ban \"canned\" hunting of big predators and rhinos in small enclosures that offer them no means of escape.\nIn addition, lions bred in captivity would have to be released into the open for at least two years before they could be hunted. Van Schalkwyk said a previously proposed six-month delay would not give lions enough time to develop self-defence instincts.\n\"Hunting should be about fair chase ... testing the wits of a hunter against that of the animal,\" he told a press conference. \"Over the years that got eroded and now we are trying to re-establish that principle.\"\nThis measure was later overturned.\n\nIn May 2007 a much-reported hunting trip involved the killing of 1,051 pound pet pig in an alleged canned hunt. The pig was named \"Monster Pig\" by the media and it was believed that the pig was a feral hog. It was soon discovered that the pig, previously named \"Fred,\" had been someone's pet and was then sold to a hunting facility only a brief time before he was killed. On May 3, paying customers Mike Stone and his 11-year-old son, Jamison, hunted him in a fenced enclosure. Jamison shot Fred a total of eight times over a period of three hours.\n\nA June 2007 story on CNN detailed canned hunting in South Africa and includes a video of a canned lion hunt where the animal is shot against a fence. On November 30, 2014, CBS 60 Minutes broadcast a story (\"The Lion Whisperer\") about one man's sanctuary in South Africa for 26 lions, raised in captivity, who he rescued from the fate of canned lion hunting.\nIn November 2015, the Professional Hunters' Association of South Africa (PHASA) voted to disassociate itself from the practice of canned lion hunting in South Africa. Unless the conservation value of canned lion hunting is demonstrated to PHASA, the organization will remain against the practice and, under penalty of expulsion, no PHASA members will be permitted to participate canned lion hunts.\n\nIn November 2017 PHASA came under fire over the body's reversal of its 2015 policy against the hunting of captive-bred lions.\n\n\n\n"}

Choroidal neovascularization is a common cause of neovascular degenerative maculopathy (i.e. 'wet' macular degeneration) commonly exacerbated by extreme myopia, malignant myopic degeneration, or age-related developments.\n\nCNV can occur rapidly in individuals with defects in Bruch's membrane, the innermost layer of the choroid. It is also associated with excessive amounts of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF). As well as in wet macular degeneration, CNV can also occur frequently with the rare genetic disease pseudoxanthoma elasticum and rarely with the more common optic disc drusen. CNV has also been associated with extreme myopia or malignant myopic degeneration, where in choroidal neovascularization occurs primarily in the presence of cracks within the retinal (specifically) macular tissue known as lacquer cracks.\n\nCNV can create a sudden deterioration of central vision, noticeable within a few weeks. Other symptoms which can occur include colour disturbances, and metamorphopsia (distortions in which straight lines appears wavy). Hemorrhaging of the new blood vessels can accelerate the onset of symptoms of CNV. CNV may also include the feeling of pressure behind your eye.\n\nCNV can be detected by using a type of perimetry called preferential hyperacuity perimetry. On the basis of fluorescein angiography, CNV may be described as classic or occult. Two other tests that help identify the condition include indocyanine green angiography and optical coherence tomography.\n\nCNV is conventionally treated with intravitreal injections of angiogenesis inhibitors (also known as \"anti-VEGF\" drugs) to control neovascularization and reduce the area of fluid below the retinal pigment epithelium. Angiogenesis inhibitors include pegaptanib, ranibizumab and bevacizumab (known by a variety of trade names, such as Macugen, Avastin or Lucentis). These inhibitors slow or stop the formation of new blood vessels (angiogenesis), typically by binding to or deactivating the transmission of vascular endothelial growth factor ('VEGF'), a signal protein produced by cells to stimulate formation of new blood vessels. The effectiveness of angiogenesis inhibitors has been shown to significantly improve visual prognosis with CNV, the recurrence rate for these neovascular areas remains high.\n\nCNV may also be treated with photodynamic therapy coupled with a photosensitive drug such as verteporfin (Visudyne). The drug is given intravenously. It is then activated in the eye by a laser light. The drug destroys the new blood vessels, and prevents any new vessels forming by forming thrombi.\n\n"}

In many cases, the condition continues to be difficult to diagnose and therefore benefits from a good understanding of the underlying cause.\n\nSigns and symptoms of constrictive pericarditis are consistent with the following: fatigue, swollen abdomen, difficulty breathing (dyspnea), swelling of legs and general weakness. Related conditions are bacterial pericarditis, pericarditis and pericarditis after a heart attack.\n\nThe cause of constrictive pericarditis in the developing world are idiopathic in origin, though likely infectious in nature. In regions where tuberculosis is common, it is the cause in a large portion of cases.\n\nCauses of constrictive pericarditis include:\n\n\nThe pathophysiological characteristics of constrictive pericarditis are due to a thickened, fibrotic pericardium that forms a non-compliant shell around the heart. This shell prevents the heart from expanding when blood enters it. This results in significant respiratory variation in blood flow in the chambers of the heart.\n\nDuring inspiration, pressure in the thoracic cavity decreases but is not relayed to the left atrium, subsequently a reduction in flow to the left atrium and ventricle happens. During diastole, less blood flow in left ventricle allows for more room for filling in right ventricle and therefore a septal shift occurs.\n\nDuring expiration, the amount of blood entering the right ventricle will decrease, allowing the interventricular septum to bulge towards the right ventricle, and increased filling of the [[left ventricle and subsequent increased pressure generated by the left ventricle during systole.This is known as [[ventricular interdependence]], since the amount of blood flow into one ventricle is dependent on the amount of blood flow into the other ventricle.\n\nThe diagnosis of constrictive pericarditis is often difficult to make. In particular, [[restrictive cardiomyopathy]] has many similar clinical features to constrictive pericarditis, and differentiating them in a particular individual is often a diagnostic dilemma.\n\n\nThe definitive treatment for constrictive pericarditis is [[pericardiectomy|pericardial stripping]], which is a surgical procedure where the entire pericardium is peeled away from the heart. This procedure has significant risk involved, with mortality rates of 6% or higher in major referral centers.\n\nA poor outcome is almost always the result after a pericardiectomy is performed for constrictive pericarditis whose origin was radiation-induced, further some patients may develop heart failure post-operatively.\n\n\n\n[[Category:Pericardial disorders]]\n[[Category:Disorders of fascia]]\n[[Category:Inflammations]]\n\n[[ja:心膜炎#慢性収縮性心膜炎]]"}

Eighty seven of Hamilton's careful drawings of the Annaimalai Hills, Palani Hills and Shevaroy Hills are in the British Library, ninety six drawings were published in his autobiography, \"Records of Sport in Southern India...\" and an additional thirty one were published in \"Forests and Gardens of South India\". \n\nLieutenant-Colonel Douglas Hamilton (1818 – 1892) was a British Indian Army officer, gazetted to the 21st Regiment of the Madras Native Infantry from 1837 to 1871. Hamilton was a well known forester, surveyor and illustrator of the early British hill stations in South India and a famous sportsman, shikari, big-game hunter and trophy collector. He was an acute observer of nature and a gentleman.\n\nThough executed only in pen and ink or pencil, these drawings have artistic merit due to the artists skillful use of hatching and stippling to achieve realistic texture, shading and perspective. Hamilton's illustration of subjects and backgrounds that are unfamiliar to most people, creates initial interest in his drawings. His effective portrayal of actual or implied recent or future dramatic action heightens the viewers interest in his subjects. Hamilton selected his sketches that best illustrate scenes in his writing. This implies there were also additional drawings, however their existence is now unknown.\n\nIn 1862 Colonel Hamilton was relieved of routine regimental Army duties and given a roving commission by Sir Charles Trevelyan, the Finance Minister of India and former Governor of Madras Presidency, to conduct surveys and make drawings for the Government of all the hill plateaus in Southern India that might suit as Sanitaria, or quarters for European troops. Thereafter, Douglas Hamilton was on \"special duty\" with the 44th Regiment, Madras Native Infantry. \n\nA series of five albums of careful drawings of the Annaimalai Hills, Palani Hills and Shevaroy Hills was the result of this commission. While at work on this commission he had great opportunities to follow his favorite pursuit of big game hunting, and also to observe the habits of the various animals inhabiting the different districts. These well-known drawings showed him as an accurate observer and a careful draughtsman. Each series of drawings was accompanied by a Survey article describing all aspects of the district.

A failure in infection control in the treatment of the second patient led to an isolated infection of Ebola virus disease in a health worker in Spain itself. The health worker survived her Ebola infection, and has since been declared infection-free.\n\nOn 5 August 2014, the Brothers Hospitallers of St. John of God confirmed that Brother Miguel Pajares, who had been volunteering in Liberia, had become infected. He was evacuated to Spain on 6 August 2014, and subsequently died on 12 August.\n\nOn 21 September it was announced that Brother Manuel García Viejo, another Spanish citizen who was medical director at the San Juan de Dios Hospital in Lunsar, had been evacuated to Spain from Sierra Leone after being infected with the virus. His death was announced on 25 September. Both of these cases were treated at the Hospital Carlos III in Madrid.\n\nIn October 2014, María Teresa Romero Ramos, an auxiliary nurse who had cared for Manuel García Viejo at the Hospital Carlos III had become unwell and on 6 October tested positive for Ebola at her local hospital in Alcorcón, the Hospital Universitario Fundación Alcorcón. A second test confirmed the diagnosis, making this the first confirmed case of Ebola transmission outside Africa. Following testing, she was transferred to the Hospital Carlos III in Madrid for treatment.\n\nAs of October 7, 50 contacts were being monitored, with 7 kept in isolation at the Hospital Carlos III, and an investigation was under way.\n\nOn 7 October, Madrid's regional government got a court order to euthanize Romero's pet dog, Excalibur, concerned that it posed a risk as a reservoir host. By the afternoon there were over 30 animal rights activists who had barricaded the apartment to prevent officials from removing the dog. A number of online petitions were started rallying to save the dog, garnering hundreds of thousands of indications of support. Ramos' quarantined husband, Javier, called on a veterinarian radio show host, and recorded a video appeal, for help to save his dog. On 8 October, Spanish authorities removed, sedated and euthanized the dog and arranged for the safe disposal of its remains.\n\nOn 9 October the Spanish health ministry quarantined three more people.\nThe health authorities announced that Maria Teresa Romero Ramos' condition had worsened significantly. On October 12, she began to show some improvement. \nAccording to one report, the improvement may be attributed to Romero's having received the experimental drug ZMab which is similar to ZMapp, which has been used to treat several Ebola patients. However, according to information released by Spain's Centre for Health and Emergency Alerts, the nurse did not receive ZMab due to concerns over possible side-effects. Romero, however, was given the experimental antiviral drug Favipiravir, and it was reported that the dosages used were much higher than those used in the treatment of other patients.\n\nMedical staff in Madrid protested about the lack of effective protective equipment and safety precautions. It was reported on October 17 that all the other people suspected of being infected in Spain had tested negative for the Ebola virus.\n\nOn October 20 it was announced that Teresa Romero had tested negative for the Ebola virus, suggesting she may have cleared the virus from her system. On November 1, it was announced that she was Ebola-free, and had been moved out of the isolation ward into a normal hospital bed to finish the process of recuperation from her illness. The WHO declared Spain Ebola-free on 2 December, 42 days after Teresa Romero was shown to be free of Ebola on 21 October.\n\nIn July 2018, a Spanish team from the in Madrid announced the discovery of an antibody and the development of a prototype vaccine against five strains of Ebola, including the most common and deadliest.\n"}
{"id": "58608087", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=58608087", "title": "Ecclesia Athletic Association", "text": "Ecclesia Athletic Association\n\nThe Ecclesia Athletic Association (EAA) was an organization founded by Eldridge Broussard in 1975, with the stated mission of helping children escape the dangers of inner-city Los Angeles through strict discipline and athletic training. In 1987, the group moved from its headquarters in the Watts neighborhood of Los Angeles to Sandy, Oregon. The group sometimes attracted accusations that it was a cult, often from neighbors or the family of members inside the group. Broussard publicly denied the label, including in 1984 and in a 1988 appearance on the The Oprah Winfrey Show.\n\nThe EAA became defunct in October 1988 after the death of Eldridge's daughter, Dayna Broussard, prompted the removal of the remaining 53 children in the organization's care and an investigation into the group. The investigation found that the children were subject to extreme fitness training and physical punishments, including floggings. Four EAA staff members were convicted of manslaughter, while Broussard and seven others were charged with child slavery by the Federal government. Broussard died before the trial, while the other seven pleaded guilty to lesser charges. \nThe Ecclesia Athletic Association (EAA) was founded in the Watts neighborhood of Los Angeles in 1975 as a sister organization to the Watts Christian Center, a church. Broussard had been a basketball star at Pacific University, was drafted by the Portland Trail Blazers, and was ordained a minister. He founded the Ecclesia Athletic Association with the goal to \"lift children out of the dead-end ghetto life through athletic training and strict discipline\". With the help of donations which for some members amounted to their entire salaries, the church was able to buy an Avalon Boulevard bakery to serve as a commune.\n\nIn 1977 Broussard shifted his focus from the Watts Christian Center, which had lost most of its membership, to the Ecclesia Athletic Association, founded by Broussard and the few remaining members of the Christian Center. Ecclesia sponsored a successful 32-team basketball league, the largest in Los Angeles at the time, and Broussard's sister ran a school focusing on nutrition; children in the care of the Ecclesia Athletic Association stopped receiving formal schooling in 1984. By this time, accusations that the group was a cult were being made publicly. Broussard, who was called \"The Coach\" or \"El\" by members, denied Ecclesia was a cult, saying: \"People who call us a cult group have never been [to the Avalon Boulevard building]. They have never examined us. They assume people are kept here because they see our discipline, because our kids walk in a straight line\". The children were described as \"hav[ing] a very clear picture in their minds that they don't want to be the same as other blacks in the Watts community\". David Jackson, who was 14 when he and his mother Constance Jackson joined the EAA, credits Broussard with rescuing him from gangs, \"\"[Broussard] actually was the person that got me out of gangs in LA and...taught me that I have options...\"\n\nThe bulk of the group's members moved to Sandy, Oregon, in 1987, though they did maintain their Avalon Boulevard headquarters. The Sandy property offered a lot more space––on which Broussard told neighbors they planned to build pools and gymnasiums. Broussard told the neighbors of their \"plan for the welfare of a lost generation\". Ecclesia bragged of the extensive calisthenics, including one to five thousand continuous jumping jacks that the children in its care could do as part of the goal of training them to be Olympic athletes.\n\nBy late 1988 Ecclesia housed 53 children ranging in age from six weeks to sixteen years, and the group had a second house in Clackamas. The parents of these children were all members of the group; they had been forced to sign a vow of poverty upon joining the group which put themselves, their children, and their assets under Broussard's control. The life of residents in Oregon was highly regimented, with the children training under the supervision of Broussard's oldest son, Eldridge Broussard III, who had been born in 1976. During a reporter's visit to Oregon, teens and adults were observed working long days in the fields, unable to talk or sing because it would, according to a group spokeswoman, lower productivity. Jackson, who was 18 and a trainer when the EAA moved to Oregon, described the conditions as basic.\n\nNeighbors did not notice any signs of bruising or other scars when they saw the children, and lent advice and equipment to Ecclesia for their farming activities. Some neighbors did experience unusual interactions with the children, not seeing them play, and once one of the children explained she was unable to speak to a neighbor who should instead talk to Ecclesia's minister of external affairs. Some neighbors feared the group was a cult reminiscent of the followers of Rajneesh. Their suspicions grew when Ecclesia began planting more crops, claimed to have grown of produce, and attempted to secure permission to place more tents and outdoor toilets across its property in order to legally house 100 people. \n\nNeighbors who suspected that the children were being abused repeatedly called authorities. A deputy who was dispatched after several complaints found 50 children living in a sweltering garage but took no action, with the Oregon Children's Services Division also declining to investigate, as association members explained the children were in a training session. Following an outcry at the zoning application by its neighbors, which included the public release of the vow of poverty, Ecclesia withdrew its application and seemingly abandoned the property in October 1987. The group had also faced resistance from neighbors in Clackamas, where Broussard was informed his land was zoned for farming, not for housing large numbers of children.\n\nOn October 14, 1988, four members of Ecclesia, Willie K. Chambers, Brian James Brinson, Constance Zipporah Jackson, and Frederick Paul Doolittle, brought the body of Dayna Broussard, Eldrige's 8-year-old daughter and the second oldest of five children, to the Sandy fire station. The four were arrested and charged with manslaughter. Eldridge had been in Los Angeles at the time of his daughter's death, but members of Ecclesia had begun returning to Sandy two months earlier. While investigating the death of Dayna, child welfare officials learned that 42 of the 53 children, all those who were older than five, were subjected to beatings of at least 100 lashes with paddles and an electrical cord and had been scarred. The children were also regularly forced to watch others being punished; many had watched the punishment of Dayna which led to her death. In an affidavit, officials described a \"cruel and terrifying experience, giving rise to mental injury\". The children were also regularly forced to go with limited food, sleep on the floor, and share only one or two working bathrooms. Authorities explained that no children had attempted to run away because Ecclesia was the only life they knew.\n\nBroussard said that the conditions authorities found were due to inexperienced members being placed in charge of the children while he was away. He defended the punishments while talking about the beatings he had experienced from his father and the cultural differences between Watts and Oregon. Following his daughter's death, Broussard announced he was going to shut down both the Ecclesia Athletic Association and the Watts Christian Center. However, Ecclesia continued to operate. In the aftermath, Broussard's brother Alvin was arrested for beating a 10-year-old boy at their Watts headquarters but prosecutors declined to charge Alvin with a felony. The Oregon Children's Services Division defended their failure to investigate, stating: \"The issues raised were not neglect or child abuse, which is the only reasons we can go out in an investigation. They felt that the kids weren't being parented properly and that's not something we go out on. If we went out on every case of parenting skills, first of all we couldn't do it, and second, people would be angry at us\".\n\nOnce in state care, most of the children were placed in two reform schools, with the remainder being placed in foster care. During this time, the children expressed more of a desire to see Broussard than their own parents. The children acted much younger than their age and had little in the way of traditional schooling, instead having biblical and fitness knowledge. The children were \"abnormally quiet and compliant\" when initially entering care, but became more rowdy when they discovered they would not be beaten for misbehaving. The state attempted to recoup over $30,000 ($ in present US dollars) in costs of caring for the children removed from their parents, though the overall costs of the care were substantially more. \n\nBy the end of 1988, Oregon state officials wanted to return some children to California to live with relatives. These plans were complicated a few weeks later when the children's parents, who had been visiting their children, announced that they would stop visiting as they refused to renounce their connection to Ecclesia. Ecclesia faced its own roadblocks in reunification when a judge blocked its request in July 1989 to let the children participate in a summer camp. Officials also tried, unsuccessfully, to prevent the children from meeting with defense lawyers.\n\nThe trial of Chambers, Brinson, Jackson, and Doolittle lasted three weeks. Many were angry that the defendants were only charged with manslaughter in Dayna's death, which the prosecutor explained by stating that more serious charges would have required more evidence of intent. During the trial, prosecutors said that Dayna's punishment stemmed from her stealing zucchini from another child and escalated from there. Several of the Ecclesia children testified that Dayna had been beaten 200 to 845 times, while children and adults testifying for the defense said it was 50 to 100 times. After a day of deliberation, the jury found all four defendants guilty of first-degree manslaughter. At the sentencing, Broussard asked the judge for clemency, but the four were sentenced to the maximum 20 years. Brinson and Doolittle were eligible for parole in 40 months, Chambers and Jackson were eligible for parole in 10 years.\n\nOn February 7, 1991, Federal prosecutors indicted Broussard, his brother, Chambers, Jackson, and four others for child slavery under the 13th Amendment, and denying children their civil rights. Stephen Peifer, an Assistant U.S. Attorney who was involved in prosecuting the case, called Ecclesia \"the largest child slavery ring in the history of the United States\". While still awaiting trial, Broussard, who had become more reclusive following the indictments and convictions, died of complications from diabetes on September 5, 1991. On January 17, 1992, the remaining seven \"pleaded guilty ... to lesser charges and were given prison terms ranging from 2 1/4 to 8 years\".\n\nBrinson was released early from his 20-year prison sentence. In 2002 he was charged with several counts of sexual abuse and found guilty of one count. The charges were unrelated to his involvement in Ecclesia. In May 2013, he was shot to death by two teenagers.\n"}

The first products were all-purpose kits that were made available to small businesses and consumers across the United States. The company’s initial first aid kit, coined FAO-134, remains successful today.\n\nIn years thereafter, the company continued to expand the number of offerings. By 1992, First Aid Only was generating $3.4 million in sales and moved to a modern 50,000 square-feet facility in Vancouver, Washington.\n\nAfter 10 years, the company started focusing on Occupational Safety & Health Administration (OSHA) compliance products for the workspace. As part of this business expansion, the company thoughtfully decided to continue to do all of its assembly and distribution work in the United States.\n\nIn its search for product innovation and improvement of delivery mechanisms for first aid products, First Aid Only acquired First Aid Exchange in 2006. First Aid Exchange owned the rights to SmartCompliance, a first aid solution that makes it convenient for organizations to remain compliant with OSHA as well as ANSI standards.\n\nIn June 2014, Acme United Corporation acquired First Aid Only for $13.8 million. First Aid Only had revenues in 2013 of $17.3 million. Shortly after the acquisition, Acme United started making capital investments in First Aid Only’s Vancouver facility, both through mechanization and staffing increases.\n\nAcme United has been in the first aid business for over 40 years and was a competitor of First Aid Only with its PhysiciansCare and Pac-Kit brands. Combined, the three brands are among the top-10 producers of first aid kits in the United States, and they accounted for 35% of Acme United’s total sales in 2014.\n\nIn 2015, Acme United consolidated its production facilities. As such, the Pac-Kit production was moved from Norwalk, Connecticut to the First Aid Only plant in Washington state. This resulted in production efficiencies and cost savings.\n\nToday, First Aid Only is will known for its SmartCompliance kits. Most businesses are federally mandated to have first aid solutions that are compliant with OSHA as well as ANSI standards.

{"id": "50123287", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=50123287", "title": "Forensic epidemiology", "text": "Forensic epidemiology\n\nThe discipline of forensic epidemiology (FE) is a hybrid of principles and practices common to both forensic medicine and epidemiology. FE is directed at filling the gap between clinical judgment and epidemiologic data for determinations of causality in civil lawsuits and criminal prosecution and defense.\n\nForensic epidemiologists formulate evidence-based probabilistic conclusions about the type and quantity of causal association between an antecedent harmful exposure and an injury or disease outcome in both populations and individuals. The conclusions resulting from an FE analysis can support legal decision-making regarding guilt or innocence in criminal actions, and provide an evidentiary support for findings of causal association in civil actions.\n\nApplications of forensic epidemiologic principles are found in a wide variety of types of civil litigation, including cases of medical negligence, toxic or mass tort, pharmaceutical adverse events, medical device and consumer product failures, traffic crash-related injury and death, person identification and life expectancy.\n\nThe term Forensic Epidemiology was first associated with the investigation of bioterrorism in 1999, and coined by Dr. Ken Alibek, the former chief deputy of the Soviet bioweapons program. The scope of FE at that time was confined to the investigation of epidemics that were potentially man-made. After the US Anthrax attacks of 2001 the CDC defined forensic epidemiology as a means of investigating possible acts of bioterrorism.\n\nAt the present time FE is more widely known and described as the systematic application of epidemiology to disputed issues of causation that are decided in (primarily) civil, but also criminal courts. The use of epidemiologic data and analysis as a basis for assessing general causation in US courts, particularly in toxic tort cases, has been described for more than 30 years, beginning with the investigation of the alleged relationship between exposure to the Swine Flu vaccine in 1976 and subsequent cases of Guillain–Barré syndrome.\n\nMore recently FE has also been described as an evidence-based method of quantifying the probability of specific causation in individuals. The approach is particularly helpful when a clinical differential diagnosis approach to causation is disputed. Examples covering a wide variety of applications of FE are listed below under Examples of Investigative Questions Addressed by Forensic Epidemiologists.\n\nThe metric of a case-specific FE analysis of cause is the comparative risk ratio (CRR). The CRR is a unique metric to FE; it allows for the comparison of probabilities applicable to the investigated circumstances of an individual injury or disease. Because a CRR is based on the unique circumstances surrounding the injury or disease of an individual, it may or may not be derived from a population-based relative risk (RR) or odds ratio (OR). An example of an RR analysis that could be used as a CRR is as follows: for an unbelted driver who was seriously injured in a traffic crash, an important causal question might be what role the failure to use a seat belt played in causing his injury. A relevant RR analysis would consist of the examination of the frequency of serious injury in 1000 randomly selected unbelted drivers exposed to a 20 mph frontal collision versus the frequency of serious injury in 1000 randomly selected restrained drivers exposed to the same collision severity and type. If the frequency of serious injury in the group exposed to the presumptive hazard (failure to use a seat belt) was 0.15 and the frequency in the unexposed (belted) group was 0.05, then the CRR would be the same thing as the RR of 0.15/0.05. The RR design of the analysis dictates that the populations that the numerator and denominator of the CRR are substantially similar in all respects, with the exception of the exposure to the investigated hazard, which was the failure to use a seat belt in the example.\n\nIn some instances encountered in a legal setting, however, the numerator and denominator risk must be derived from dissimilar populations in order to fit the circumstances of an investigated injury or disease. In such a case the CRR cannot be derived from either an RR or OR. An example of such a situation occurs when the numerator is a per event risk, and the denominator is a per-time risk (also known as a cumulative risk). An example of this type of analysis would be the investigation of a pulmonary embolism (PE) that occurred a week after a patient sustained a lower extremity fracture in a traffic crash. Such complications often result from blood clots forming in the legs and then traveling to the lungs. If the patient had a history of deep vein thrombosis (DVT) in the lower extremities prior to the crash, then a CRR might consist of the comparison between the risk of a PE following a lower extremity fracture (a per event rate) and the 1-week risk of PE in a patient with DVT (a time-dependent probability).\n\nAnother example of a CRR based on dissimilar populations is when there are only a limited number of potential causes to be compared. An example is the investigation of the cause of an adverse reaction in a person who took two different drugs at the same time, both of which could have caused the reaction (and which, for the example, do not interact with each other). In such a situation, the CRR applicable to the unique circumstances experienced by the individual could be estimated by comparing the adverse reaction rate for the two drugs.\n\nThe attributable proportion under the exposed (AP ) is an indication of the proportion of patients who were exposed to the potential cause and got sick because of this exposure. It can only be used if the RR >1 and can be calculated by [(RR-1)/RR X 100%]. When the CRR is based on an RR, these formulae also apply to the CRR. The result of the analysis, given as an RR, CRR, or AP , meets the legal standard of what is “\"more likely true than not\",” when the RR or CRR is >2.0 (with a 95% confidence interval lower boundary of >1.0), or the AP is >50%. The AP is also known as the \"\"Probability of Causation\" (PC)\" a term that is defined in the US Code of Federal Regulations (Federal Register / Vol. 67, No. 85 / Thursday, May 2, 2002 / Rules and Regulations p. 22297) and elsewhere.\n\nAnalysis of causation, particularly for injury or other conditions with a relatively short latency period between exposure and outcome, is accomplished using a 3-step approach, as follows:\n\nThe 3-step methodology was challenged in United States District Court for the District of Colorado in \"Etherton v Auto-Owners Insurance Company.\" The defendant challenged, among other things, the reliability and fit of the methods described by the expert. After an extensive examination and discussion of the 3-step process used by the expert, the Court found that the methodology appropriately fit the specific facts of the case, and that a population-based (epidemiologic) approach was an appropriate part of the causal methodology. The Court denied the Defendant’s motion to strike the expert’s testimony in the order, which was entered on 3/3l/l4.\n\nThe Defendant appealed the ruling from the District Court, and in July 2016, the Tenth Circuit U.S. Court of Appeals affirmed the 3-step causal methodology as generally accepted and well established for assessing injury causation, under the Daubert standard. See \"Etherton v. Auto-Owners Insurance Company\", No. 14-1164 (10th Cir, 7/l9/l6).\n\nPlausibility of an investigated association can be assessed in an FE investigation, in part, via application of the Hill criteria, named for a 1965 publication by Sir Austin Bradford-Hill, in which he described nine “viewpoints” by which an association described in an epidemiologic study could be assessed for causality. Hill declined to call his viewpoints “criteria” lest they be considered a checklist for assessing causation. The term “ Hill criteria” is used widely in the literature, however, and for convenience is used in the present discussion. Of the nine criteria, there are seven that have utility for assessing the plausibility of an investigated specific causal relationship, as follows:\n\nSubsequent authors have added the feature of Challenge/ Dechallenge/ Rechallenge for circumstances when the exposure is repeated over time and there is the ability to observe the associated outcome response, as might occur with an adverse reaction to a medication. Additional considerations when assessing an association are the potential impact of confounding and bias in the data, which can obscure a true relationship. Confounding refers to a situation in which an association between an exposure and outcome is all or partly the result of a factor that affects the outcome but is unaffected by the exposure. Bias refers to a form of error that may threaten the validity of a study by producing results that are systematically different from the true results. Two main categories of bias in epidemiologic studies are selection bias, which occurs when study subjects are selected as a result of another unmeasured variable that is associated with both the exposure and outcome of interest; and information bias, which is systematic error in the assessment of a variable. While useful when assessing a previously unexplored association, there is no combination or minimal number of these criteria that must be met in order to conclude that a plausible relationship exists between a known exposure and an observed outcome.\n\nIn many FE investigations there is no need for a causal plausibility analysis if a general causal relationship is well established. In large part, plausibility of a relationship is entertained once implausibility has been rejected. The two remaining Hill criteria are temporality and strength of association. While both criteria have utility in assessing specific causation, temporality is the feature of an association that must be present, at least with regard to sequence (\"i.e.\", the exposure must precede the outcome), in order to consider a relationship causal. Temporal proximity can also be useful in some specific causation evaluations, as the closer the investigated exposure and the outcome are in time the less opportunity there is for an intervening cause to act. Another feature of temporality that may have a role in a specific causation evaluation is latency. An outcome may occur too soon or too long after an exposure to be considered causally related. As an example, some food borne illnesses must incubate for hours or days after ingestion, and thus an illness that begins directly following a meal, and which is later found to be caused by a food borne microorganism that requires >12 h incubation, was not caused by the investigated meal, even if an investigation were to reveal the microorganism in the ingested food. Strength of association is the criterion that is used in general causation to assess the impact of the exposure on the population, and is often quantified in terms of RR. In a specific causation evaluation the strength of the association between the exposure and the outcome is quantified by the CRR, as described above.\nTest accuracy investigation is a standard practice in clinical epidemiology. In this setting, a diagnostic test is scrutinized to determine by various measures how often a test result is correct. In FE the same principles are used to evaluate the accuracy of proposed tests leading to conclusions that are central to fact finder determinations of guilt or innocence in criminal investigations, and of causality in civil matters. The utility of a test is highly dependent on its accuracy, which is determined by a measure of how often a positive or negative test result truly represents the actual status that is being tested. For any test or criterion there are typically four possible results: (1) a true positive (TP), in which the test correctly identifies tested subjects with the condition of interest; (2) a true negative (TN), in which the test correctly identifies test subjects who do not have the condition of interest; (3) a false positive (FP), in which the test is positive even though condition is not present, and; (4) a false negative (FN) in which the test is negative even though the condition is present. Fig. 3.19 is a contingency table illustrating the relationships between test results and condition presence, as well as the following test accuracy parameters:\n\nProbability is used to characterize the degree of belief in the truth of an assertion. The basis for such a belief can be a physical system that produces outcomes at a rate that is uniform over time, such as a gaming device like a roulette wheel or a die. With such a system, the observer does not influence the outcome; a fair six-sided die that is rolled enough times will land on any one of its sides 1/6th of the time. An assertion of a probability based in a physical system is easily tested with sufficient randomized experimentation. Conversely, the basis for a high degree of belief in an asserted claim may be a personally held perspective that cannot be tested. This does not mean that the assertion is any less true than one that can be tested. As an example, one might truthfully assert that “if I eat a banana there is a high probability that it will make me nauseous” based upon experience unknown to anyone but one’s self. It is difficult to test such assertions, which are evaluated through collateral evidence of plausibility and analogy, often based on similar personal experience. In forensic settings, assertions of belief are often characterized as probabilities, that is, \"what is most likely\", for a given set of facts. For circumstances in which a variety of conditions exist that may modify or “ condition” the probability of a particular outcome or scenario, a method of quantifying the relationship between the modifying conditions and the probability of the outcome employs Bayesian reasoning, named for Bayes’ Theorem or Law upon which the approach is based. Most simply stated, Bayes’ Law allows for a more precise quantification of the uncertainty in a given probability. As applied in a forensic setting, Bayes’ Law tells us what we want to know given what we do know. Although Bayes’ Law is known in forensic sciences primarily for its application to DNA evidence, a number of authors have described the use of Bayesian reasoning for other applications in forensic medicine, including identification and age estimation.\n\nThe post-test probability is a highly useful Bayesian equation that allows for the calculation of the probability that a condition is present when the test is positive, conditioned by the pretest prevalence of the condition of interest. This equation is given in box to the right:\n\nThe equation results in a positive predictive value for a given pre-event or pretest prevalence. In a circumstance in which the pretest prevalence is considered “indifferent” the prevalence and (1-prevalence) values cancel out, and the calculation is a simplified to a positive predictive value.\n\n\n\nCitations\n\nFurther reading\n"}

{"id": "319138", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=319138", "title": "French paradox", "text": "French paradox\n\nThe French paradox is a catchphrase, first used in the late 1980s, that summarizes the apparently paradoxical epidemiological observation that French people have a relatively low incidence of coronary heart disease (CHD), while having a diet relatively rich in saturated fats, in apparent contradiction to the widely held belief that the high consumption of such fats is a risk factor for CHD. The paradox is that if the thesis linking saturated fats to CHD is valid, the French ought to have a higher rate of CHD than comparable countries where the per capita consumption of such fats is lower.\n\nThe French paradox implies two important possibilities. The first is that the hypothesis linking saturated fats to CHD is not completely valid (or, at the extreme, is entirely invalid). The second possibility is that the link between saturated fats and CHD is valid, but that some additional factor in the French diet or lifestyle mitigates this risk—presumably with the implication that if this factor can be identified, it can be incorporated into the diet and lifestyle of other countries, with the same lifesaving implications observed in France. Both possibilities have generated considerable media interest, as well as some scientific research.\n\nIt has also been suggested that the French paradox is an illusion, created in part by differences in the way that French authorities collect health statistics, as compared to other countries, and in part by the long-term effects, in the coronary health of French citizens, of changes in dietary patterns which were adopted years earlier.\n\nThe term \"French Paradox\" was first used in \"The Letter\", the newsletter of the International Organisation of Vine and Wine, in 1986. In 1989, theatre Professor George Riley Kernodle of the University of Arkansas used the term in a chapter in his book \"Theatre In History\", later republished as a separate academic paper.\n\nIn 1991, Serge Renaud, a scientist from Bordeaux University, France—considered today the father of the phrase—presented the results of his scientific study into the term and actual scientific data behind the perception of the phrase. This was followed by a public documentary broadcast on the American CBS News television channel, \"60 Minutes\".\n\nRenaud's observations regarding the apparent disconnect between French patterns of high saturated fat consumption and their low rates of cardiovascular disease can be quantified using data from the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations. In 2002, the average French person consumed 108 grams per day of fat from animal sources, while the average American consumed only 72 grams. The French eat four times as much butter, 60 percent more cheese and nearly three times as much pork. Although the French consume only slightly more total fat (171 g/d vs 157 g/d), they consume much more saturated fat because Americans consume a much larger proportion of fat in the form of vegetable oil, with most of that being soybean oil. However, according to data from the British Heart Foundation, in 1999, rates of death from coronary heart disease among males aged 35–74 years were 115 per 100,000 people in the U.S. but only 83 per 100,000 in France.\n\nIn 1991, Renaud extended his studies in partnership with then junior researchers, cardiologist Michel de Lorgeril and dietician Patricia Salen. The three enhanced Renaud's study, with their paper concluding that: a diet based on southwestern Mediterranean cuisine; which is high in omega-3 oils, antioxidants and includes \"moderate consumption\" of red wine; created lower cases of cancer, myocardial infarction and cardiovascular disease; partly through increasing HDL cholesterol whilst reducing LDL cholesterol.\n\nIn 1999, Malcolm Law and Nicholas Wald published a study in the \"British Medical Journal\", using data from a 1994 study of alcohol and diet to explain how the French paradox might actually be an illusion, caused by two statistical distortions.\n\nFirst, Law and Wald attributed about 20% of the difference in the observed rates of CHD between France and the United Kingdom to the under-certification of CHD in France, relative to the UK.\n\nSecond, Law and Wald presented a time-lag hypothesis: if there were a delay in serum cholesterol concentrations increasing and a subsequent increase in ischaemic heart disease mortality, then the current rate of mortality from CHD is more likely to be linked to past levels of serum cholesterol and fat consumption than to current serum cholesterol levels and patterns of fat consumption. They wrote,\n\nWe propose that the difference is due to the time lag between increases in consumption of animal fat and serum cholesterol concentrations and the resulting increase in mortality from heart disease—similar to the recognised time lag between smoking and lung cancer. Consumption of animal fat and serum cholesterol concentrations increased only recently in France but did so decades ago in Britain.\n\nEvidence supports this explanation: mortality from heart disease across countries, including France, correlates strongly with levels of animal fat consumption and serum cholesterol in the past (30 years ago)...\n\nIn addition, the French population has become increasingly overweight. A study published by the French Institute of Health and Medical Research (INSERM) revealed an increase in obesity from 8.5% in 1997 to 14.5% in 2009, with women showing a greater tendency toward obesity than men.\n\nMuch commentary has been based on the assumption that the French paradox is real and is not the statistical distortion posited by Law and Wald. If the French paradox is regarded as real, the most obvious implication is that under certain circumstances, it is possible for individuals to consume a diet rich in saturated fats, and nonetheless avoid cardiovascular disease. Therefore, proposed explanations for the paradox have attracted considerable interest in other countries, including the creation of considerable demand for foods or supplements said to explain the paradox. The search for an explanation for the paradox has also led to some additional research.\n\nThe overall impact of the popular perception, in the English-speaking world, that the French paradox is a real phenomenon, has been to give added credibility to health claims associated with specific French dietary practices.\n\nThis was seen most dramatically when, in 1991, an early account of the then-novel concept of the French paradox was aired in the United States on \"60 Minutes.\" The broadcast left the impression that France's high levels of red wine consumption accounted for much of the country's lower incidence of cardiac disease. Within a year, the consumption of red wine in the United States had increased by 40% and some wine sellers began promoting their products as \"health food.\"\n\nThe cultural impact of the French paradox can be seen in the large number of book titles in the diet-and-health field which purport to give the reader access to the secrets behind the paradox: \n\nOther books sought to boost their credibility by reference to the French paradox. The American edition of \"The Dukan Diet\", written by Pierre Dukan, a Paris-based doctor, is marketed with the subtitle, “The real reason the French stay thin.”\n\nThe existence of the French paradox has caused some researchers to speculate that the link between dietary consumption of saturated fats and coronary heart disease might not be as strong as had previously been imagined. This has resulted in a review of the earlier studies which had suggested this link.\n\nSome researchers have thrown into question the entire claimed connection between natural saturated fat consumption and cardiovascular disease. In 2006 this view received some indirect support from the results of the Nurses' Health Study run by the Women's Health Initiative. After accumulating approximately 8 years of data on the diet and health of 49,000 post-menopausal American women, the researchers found that the balance of saturated versus unsaturated fats did not appear to affect heart disease risk, whereas the consumption of trans fat was associated with significantly increased risk of cardiovascular disease.\n\nSimilarly, the authors of a 2009 review of dietary studies concluded that there was insufficient evidence to establish a causal link between consumption of saturated fats and coronary heart disease risk.\n\nIt has been suggested that France's high red wine consumption is a primary factor in the trend. This hypothesis was expounded in a \"60 Minutes\" broadcast in 1991. The program catalysed a large increase in North American demand for red wines from around the world. It is believed that one of the components of red wine potentially related to this effect is resveratrol; however, the authors of a 2003 study concluded that the amount of resveratrol absorbed by drinkers of red wine is small enough that it is unlikely to explain the paradox.\nResearch suggests that moderate drinkers are less likely to suffer heart attacks than are abstainers or heavy drinkers (see alcohol and cardiovascular disease for details). Therefore, the alcohol in wine might be a factor in the French paradox.\n\nHowever, the difference between U.S. annual \"per capita\" alcohol consumption (9.2 litres per year) and French consumption (12.2 litres per year) is only 3 litres per year more.\n\nThere is a lack of medical consensus about whether moderate consumption of beer, wine, or distilled spirits has a stronger association with longevity. Of ten major studies, three found stronger evidence for wine, three for beer, three for liquor, and one study found no difference between alcoholic beverages.\n\nWines, particularly red wines, are a source of low levels of resveratrol. High doses of resveratrol have been linked to longevity and cancer prevention in other species.\nAlthough research continues on resveratrol, the concentration in wine seems too low to account for the French paradox.\n\nOligomeric procyanidins have been proposed to offer protection to human vascular cells, with other research indicating that red wine polyphenols reduce absorption of malondialdehyde which is implicated in elevating levels of low-density lipoprotein in the onset of arteriosclerosis.\n\nHowever, once digested and metabolized, the role of polyphenols to assert possible health effects in humans cannot be determined. Although polyphenols are speculated to be part of the health-promoting effects of wine consumption, no evidence exists to date that ingesting polyphenols from red wine or food sources actually provides health benefits.\n\nIn his 2009 book \"Cholesterol and The French Paradox\", Frank Cooper argues that the French paradox is due to the lack of hydrogenated and trans fats in the French diet. The French diet is based on natural saturated fats such as butter, cheese and cream that the human body finds easy to metabolize, because they are rich in shorter saturated fatty acids ranging from the 4-carbon butyric acid to the 16-carbon palmitic acid. But the American diet includes greater amounts of saturated fats made via hydrogenating vegetable oils which include longer 18- and 20-carbon fatty acids. In addition, these hydrogenated fats include small quantities of trans fats which may have associated health risks.\n\nIn his 2003 book, \"The Fat Fallacy: The French Diet Secrets to Permanent Weight Loss\", Will Clower suggests the French paradox may be narrowed down to a few key factors, namely:\n\nClower tends to downplay the common beliefs that wine consumption and smoking are greatly responsible for the French paradox. While a higher percentage of French people smoke, this is not greatly higher than the U.S. (35% in France vs. 25% in U.S.) and is unlikely to account for the weight difference between countries.\n\nMireille Guiliano, author of the 2006 bestseller \"French Women Don't Get Fat\", agrees that the weight differences are not due to French smoking habits. She points out that the smoking rates for women in France and the U.S. are virtually identical. Guiliano explains the key factors to the French woman's ability to stay slim as:\n\nIn his 2008 book \"In Defense of Food\", Michael Pollan suggests the explanation is not any single nutrient, but the combination of nutrients found in unprocessed food; not any one nutrient, nor the amount of carbohydrates or fats or proteins, but the whole length and breadth of nutrients found in \"natural\" foods as opposed to \"processed\" foods.\n\nIt has been suggested that a higher intake of fruit and vegetables in the diet may lower the risk of cardiovascular diseases.\n\nOne proposed explanation of the French paradox regards possible effects (epigenetic or otherwise) of dietary improvements in the first months and years of life, exerted across multiple generations. Following defeat in the Franco-Prussian War in 1871, the French government introduced an aggressive nutritional program providing high quality foods to pregnant women and young children with the aim of fortifying future generations of soldiers (the program was implemented about three decades prior to an analogous initiative in England in response to the Boer War). It has been suggested that the particular timing of this historical intervention might help explain the relatively low rates of obesity and heart disease found in France.\n\n\n\n\n"}

It was expanded to include a facility for tuberculosis patients and included 12 new beds for the medically indigent. In 1949, the number of beds increased to 330. Additionally, a laboratory and the ability to treat patients with pulmonary diseases was added. The facility was expanded again in 1953, adding a surgical unit named after Guibert Germain and a blood transfusion unit. The hospital was renamed in 1955 after General Peltier to commemorate his service as a chief physician for 25 years. Additional operating theaters were added the same year. The facility expanded again in 1968 to include a 35 bed maternal ward and 30 beds for eye and ENT.\n\nIn 2010 there were an estimated 23 physicians and 80 nurses per 100,000 people.

Its headquarters are in Terrasses de la Chaudière, in downtown Gatineau, Quebec.\n\nPursuant to the Department of Indian Affairs and Northern Development Act the term \"Indian\" remains in the department's legal name, although the term \"Indigenous\" is used in its applied title under the Federal Identity Program.\n\nFirst Nation, has been used since the 1970s instead of the word \"Indian\", which some people found offensive. The term \"Indian\" is used for legal and historical documents such as Status Indians as defined by the \"Indian Act\". For example, the term \"Indian\" continues to be used in the historical and legal document, the Canadian Constitution and federal statutes. Aboriginal Affairs and Northern Development Canada used the term Inuit in referring to \"an Aboriginal people in Northern Canada, who live in Nunavut, Northwest Territories, Northern Quebec and Northern Labrador. The word means \"people\" in the Inuit language — Inuktitut. The singular of Inuit is Inuk.\" Eskimo is found in historical documents about Canadian Inuit.\nThe term \"Aboriginal\" is commonly used when referring to the three groups of indigenous peoples as a whole. It is also used by Aboriginal people who live within Canada who claim rights of sovereignty or Aboriginal title to lands.\n\nIndigenous and Northern Affairs Canada (INAC) is one of the federal government departments responsible for meeting the Government of Canada's obligations and commitments to First Nations, Inuit and Métis, and for fulfilling the federal government's constitutional responsibilities in the North. INAC's responsibilities are largely determined by numerous statutes, negotiated agreements and relevant legal decisions. Most of the Department's programs, representing a majority of its spending - are delivered through partnerships with Aboriginal communities and federal-provincial or federal-territorial agreements. INAC also works with urban Indigenous people, Métis and Non-Status Indians (many of whom live in rural areas).\n\nIndigenous and Northern Affairs Canada (INAC) supports indigenous peoples (First Nations, Inuit and Métis) and Northerners in their efforts to:\n\nINAC also works with urban First Nations, Métis and Non-Status Indians (many of whom live in rural areas) through the Office of the Federal Interlocutor. INAC also manages the resources and lands of federal lands, including land and subsurface leases and resource royalties.\n\nIn 1755, the British Crown established the British Indian Department. The Indian Governors General held control of Indian Affairs, but usually delegated much of their responsibility to a series of Civil Secretaries. In 1860, the responsibility for Indian affairs was transferred from the government of Great Britain to the Province of Canada and the responsibility for Indian Affairs was given to the Crown Lands Department Commissions Responsible for Indian Affairs.\n\nThe federal government's legislative responsibilities for Indians and Inuit derive from section 91(24) of the Constitution Act, 1867 and responsibility was given to the Secretary of State for the Provinces Responsible for Indian Affairs. In 1876, the Indian Act, which remains the major expression of federal jurisdiction in this area, was passed and a series of treaties were concluded between Canada and the various Indian bands across the country.\n\nThe responsibility for Indian Affairs and Northern Development rested with various government departments between 1873 and 1966. The Minister of the Interior also held the position of Superintendent-General of Indian Affairs after the Indian Affairs Department was established in 1880. In 1939, federal jurisdiction for Indian peoples was interpreted by the courts to apply to the Inuit. A revised Indian Act was passed in 1951.\n\nFrom 1950 to 1965, the Indian Affairs portfolio was carried by the Minister of Citizenship and Immigration. On October 1, 1966, the Department of Indian Affairs and Northern Development was created as a result of the Government Organization Act, 1966. Effective June 13, 2011, the department began using the applied title Aboriginal Affairs and Northern Development Canada in addition to the legal name of the department.\n\nThe Northern Development part of the department has its origins in the Department of the Interior, a body created by then Prime Minister John A. Macdonald for the purpose of administering the Dominion Lands Act of 1872. When the Department of the Interior dissolved in 1936 (with the Natural Resources Acts transferring control over natural resources to the Prairie provinces), Indian Affairs fell under the purview of the Department of Mines and Resources. However, the need for social and health-care services in the North led to the establishment of the Northern Administration and Lands branch in 1951, which led to the creation of the Department of Northern Affairs and National Resources in 1953. This became the Department of Indian Affairs and Northern Development in 1966. Under the Federal Identity Program, the department is known as Indigenous and Northern Affairs Canada.\n\nBeginning in the early 20th century, the Canadian government sponsored annual expeditions to the Canadian North. These expeditions yielded extensive photographic documentation of the lives of northern indigenous peoples by participating explorers, engineers, scientists and medical staff.\n\nExplorer, photographer, filmmaker, writer and lecturer Richard S. Finnie accompanied numerous expeditions to the North. His first voyage was aboard CGS \"Arctic\", under the command of Captain Bernier in 1924. During the 1930–1931 expedition to the Western Arctic, Finnie served as filmmaker. Lachlan T. Burwash, an exploratory engineer with the Department of the Interior, made a survey of the east coasts of Hudson Bay and James Bay, and the Belcher Islands in the late 1920s.\n\nZoologist Joseph Dewey Soper travelled to the Baffin Island (Qikiqtaaluk) region in the late 1920s in order to document the landscape, as well as the plant and bird life.

This report recommends an increase in Inuit participation in Nunavut's federal and territorial public service.\n\nBy January 2012 there were two government audits that revealed that the federal government had earmarked about a billion dollars annually on constructing and/or maintaining First Nations infrastructure in First Nations communities.\n\n\"Findings from the \"AFN First Nations Regional Longitudinal Health Survey 2002/2003 study (March 2007) are notable: More than 1/5 of adult respondents report that they have no access to garbage collection services; Nine percent of homes do not have either sewage service or a septic tank; and Only 2/3 of respondents considered their water safe to drink: Over 60 percent of respondents obtain their drinking water from bottled water. To cite a 2003 INAC study, 39 percent of water systems exceeded one or more of the risk indicator thresholds occasionally or continuously. Among key informants, there was unanimous consensus that there is a clear infrastructure deficit on reserve and in the different categories, according to the community; investment needed in housing, school, water facilities, and roads were usually mentioned as examples.\"\n\nCommunity Infrastructure $1.028 billion\n\nFNIF $234 million (lifespan)\n\nThe First Nations Infrastructure Fund (FNIF) was introduced in 2007 to improve the quality of life and the environment for First Nation communities. It is a targeted fund that accepted proposals for community projects under the following headings: 1) Planning and Skills Development, 2) Solid Waste Management, 3) Roads and Bridges 4) Energy Systems 5) Connectivity. The amount available to each community through the First Nations Infrastructure Fund (FNIF) was limited to a total of $10 million over a five-year period. By March 2008, a total of 262 proposals (out of the 714 submitted) were approved for FNIF funding. Nationally, $94.3 million of FNIF funding was dispersed.\nFirst Nations Water and Wastewater Action Plan (FNWWAP) $2.5 billion (lifespan)7\nN/A\n\nIn 2005, the Office of the Auditor General of Canada \"reported the lack of a legislative regime to ensure that water quality on reserves met the Guidelines for Canadian Drinking Water Quality, despite the existence of such a regime in every province and territory (OAG 2011 page 11).\" The auditor general's report (2011-06) noted that INAC and Health Canada \"do not ensure that drinking water is tested on a regular basis.\"\n\nIn 1991, less than 80% of on-reserve housing had basic water and sewer services. (NAWWSFNS 2003:26)\n\nBy 2001, about 98% of on-reserve houses had water and 94% had sewer services. (NAWWSFNS 2003:26)\n\nThe report dated May 2003 revealed that \"of the 740 community water systems assessed, about 29% posed a potentially high risk that could negatively impact water quality (p. i. ) Only 25% were in the low or no risk category. Of the 462 community waterwater systems assessed, 16% (74) were classified at a potential high risk that could negatively impact wastewater effluent quality. (p. ii.) Circuit Rider Training Program began in 2000. \"The capital cost to address deficiencies to water and wastewater systems was estimated between $475 million and $560 million in 2003. The capital investment to provide basic water and wastewater services to about 5,300 homes which did not have basic water and wastewater services would have cost $185 million in 2003. Support for normal recapitalization and expansion for growth was estimated at $90 million to $100 million annually. p.iii)\n\n\"The National Assessment released in April 2011 was the result of \"the most rigorous and comprehensive evaluation of water and wastewater systems on reserve ever under taken. Between July 2009 and spring 2011, independent engineers inspected 4000 on-reserve systems including 1,300 water and wastewater systems and more than 800 wells and 1,900 septic fields serving 571 First Nation communities.\"\n\nThe National Assessment of Water and Wastewater Systems in First Nation Communities (2011) \"found that 39 per cent of First Nations water systems were at high risk of being unsafe, affecting 25 per cent of people living on reserves. It said Ottawa would need $1.2 billion in repairs, better infrastructure and training to fix the problem, as well as an additional $4.7 billion over 10 years to keep pace with growing demand.\"\n\n39% of the 807 water systems inspected were classified as high overall risk affecting 25 per cent of the on-reserve population base. The study found that \"314 water systems were high risk, 161 water systems in 116 First Nation communities were under Health Canada Drinking-Water Advisories (DWA) as of February 2011. These DWAs may be impacting up to 18,900 people, which is approximately 3.9 percent of the total on-reserve population cited as 484,321 in the National Roll-up.\"\n\nThe National Assessment of Water and Wastewater Systems in First Nation Communities 'suggests many communities remain vulnerable to the health and environmental problems that result from poor water quality and inadequate sanitation. The assessment, which was released in April 2011, looked at the water and sewer systems of 571 First Nations (with a total population of 484,321 and 112,836 \"dwellings\") and evaluated their water source and how well each system was designed, operated and monitored. It categorized 39 per cent of the water systems as \"high risk,\" meaning they have \"major deficiencies\" that pose a high risk to water quality and could lead to potential health and safety or environmental concerns. Thirty-four per cent were assessed as posing medium risk to the quality of water and health and having deficiencies that \"should be corrected to avoid future problems.\"\n\n\n\n"}

It is administered directly into the bloodstream of patients suffering from chronic kidney disease (CKD) in an effort to decrease the associated morbidity and mortality experienced in patients with renal failure. IDPN contains protein (amino acids), carbohydrates (dextrose), and fats (lipids) in an attempt to meet a patient's weekly nutritional needs. Solutions can be individualized for each patient based on weight, needs, medical history and enteral intake.\n\nPrior to 1990, traditional therapies for dialysis patients such as liberalized diet and oral supplements, led to protein malnutrition and/or calorie malnutrition.\n\nEfforts to supplement nutritional intake by providing nutrients during the dialysis procedure were attempted. As a result, IDPN became an established therapy to replete malnourished CKD-5 dialysis patients in the early 1990s. Generally the patients received a set formulation containing standard amounts of dextrose, amino acids and lipids regardless of the patient's weight, dialysis time and complicating co-morbid conditions.\n\nTo address specific nutritional needs of individual patients, several providers of IDPN therapy developed formulations that take clinical variables into account in order to best fit the patient’s individual needs and condition. Specific formulations address distinct differences between nutritional needs of those patients who exhibit protein malnutrition and those patients who exhibit calorie malnutrition.\n\n"}

He was Deacon (President) of the Incorporation of Surgeons and Barbers of Edinburgh.\n\nJohn Naysmith was the younger son of Sir Michael Naysmyth (or Nasmyth) of Posso (1516-1607), Chamberlain to John Hamilton, the archbishop of St Andrews. His mother was Elizabeth,(1503-1606) daughter of John Baird of Posso (1483-1526), owner of the estate of that name in Peebles-shire. His elder brother James Naysmith inherited the Posso estate and became falconer to King James VI. John Naysmyth's early education was at St Mary's College, St Andrews after which he was apprenticed to the surgeon Gilbert Primrose in Edinburgh. He was admitted to the Incorporation of Surgeons and Barbers of Edinburgh in 1588.\n\nHe married Helen Macmath in Edinburgh on 26 March 1600.\n\nHe was elected Deacon (President) of the Incorporation of Surgeons and Barbers of Edinburgh in 1595.\n\nGilbert Primrose, his surgical master had been surgeon to King James VI and became Serjeant-Surgeon to King James VI and I when the King and his court moved to London. Presumably as a result of Primrose’s patronage Naysmith was made a surgeon to King James VI, and he too moved with the Court to London on the occasion of the Union of the Crowns. King James VI, now King James I made him Royal Herbalist for life. During his time in London he attended Prince Henry during his fatal illness.\n\nLike his father he was an active supporter of Mary, Queen of Scots. It is thought that he was a member of Lord Seton's party, a small select group who were entrusted to journey to England in 1675, ostensibly to pay homage to Queen Elizabeth, but in reality to smuggle letters to the imprisoned Mary Queen of Scots from the then Scottish Regent, James Douglas, 4th Earl of Morton. This was achieved successfully, and, as a result of his part in this exploit he found favour with the teenage King James VI. Yet in an era of plotting and conspiracy and vaccillating political loyalty he had been suspected of involvement in the 1591 plot against the King by Francis Stewart 5th Earl of Bothwell. He was imprisoned in Edinburgh Castle then Dumbarton Castle before being ordered by the privy council to go abroad under caution of 1000 merks (£666 Scots). The caution was subsequently deleted by warrant of the King on 1 August 1593. He fled to France where he became Chief Surgeon to the Scots Guards of the King of France.\n\nReturning to Scotland in 1599, he appears to have been forgiven for his earlier infidelity, and was accepted back into the Royal Court. He was among the retainers with the King at Falkland Palace on the occasion of the Gowrie Conspiracy in 1600. Gilbert Primrose, his surgical master, had by now been made Serjeant-Surgeon (or Chief Surgeon) to King James VI. Naysmith became a surgeon to King James VI and, on the Union of the Crowns in 1603, he travelled with the Court to London. King James, now King James I of England, made him Royal Herbalist for life.\n\nNaysmith died in London and was buried in Greyfriars churchyard in Edinburgh where an elaborate monument marks his grave. The inscription in Latin is now almost obliterated but has been translated as follows; Here lies John Nasmyth, of the family of Posso, an honourable family of Tweedale, a citizen of Edinburgh, chief surgeon to his most Serene Majesty and to the King of France's troop of guards from Scotland - having excellently performedall the duties of a godly life; who dying at London to the grief of both nations, in the exercise of office with his Majesty, ordered his body to be conveyed hither (such was his love to his country), to be buried in this dormitory; acquiting himself to his King, his country and his friends by the utmost of his power and duty. He died in the 57th year of his age, the 10th of September 1613. Why is it grievous to return whence you came?His testament was proved in the Edinburgh Commissary Court on 19 January 1614\n"}

{"id": "46215453", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=46215453", "title": "Mukbang", "text": "Mukbang\n\nMukbang or muk-bang (; ) is a live online audiovisual broadcast in which a host eats large amounts of foods while interacting with their audience. Usually done through an internet webcast (such streaming platforms include Afreeca, Youtube, Twitch and etc), mukbang became popular in South Korea in the 2010s. Foods ranging from pizza to noodles are consumed in front of a camera for an internet audience (who pay or not, depending on which platform one is watching).\n\nIn each broadcast, a host will often interact with their viewers through online chatrooms. With the rising popularity of these eating shows, hosts have found lucrative ways of benefiting from the online show. Many hosts generate revenue through mukbang, by accepting donations or partnering with advertising networks.\n\nThe word mukbang is a portmanteau of the Korean words for \"eating\" () and \"broadcast\" ().\n\nThe mukbang Internet culture began on AfreecaTV in 2009. The phenomenon of mukbang became more global interest after American entertainment duo \"The Fine Brothers\" created a video which shows the reaction of Western people to mukbang eating contests.\n\nThere are several explanations given by various scholars. Jeff Yang, an Asian-American cultural critic and senior vice president of the global research firm Kantar Futures, said that mukbang had its origins in \"the loneliness of unmarried or uncoupled [South] Koreans, in addition to the inherently social aspect of eating in [South] Korea\" during the interview with Quartz.\n\nKim-Hae Jin, Ph.D candidate from Chosun University, argued that one can vicariously satisfy the desire for the food. The hosts, who call themselves BJs (Broadcast Jockeys), interact with the people who are watching the broadcast through chatting. BJs sometimes claim to be the audience's \"avatar\" and will exactly follow what people ask them to do.\n\nAdema contends in her article: \"food television incorporates the vicarious pleasures of watching someone else cook and eat; the emulsion of entertainment and cooking; the jumbling of traditional gender roles; and ambivalence toward cultural standards of body, consumption, and health. ... simultaneously perpetuates the stress of social expectations. \"\n\nOther genres of mukbang include \"cook-bang\" (cooking and eating) shows. \n\nSouth Korean video game players have sometimes broadcast mukbang as breaks during their overall streams. The popularity of this practice among local users led the video game streaming service Twitch.tv to begin trialling a dedicated \"Social eating\" category in July 2016; a representative of the service stated that this category is not necessarily specific to mukbang, but would leave the concept open to interpretation by streamers within its guidelines.\n\nThe popularity of mukbang has inspired different variations and adaptions of the \"Eating Broadcasting\" concept. This trend has continued to gain viewers, create stars, and profit, catching the interest of mainstream media both domestically and internationally. \nIn South Korea, there was a drama called \"Let's Eat\" (Hangul: 식샤를 합시다; RR: Siksareul Habsida) that focused on people who were brought together due to their love of food. In the drama, the characters explore various restaurants and after each episode, the featured foods became a hot topic among young adult viewers. Viewers sought out these restaurants.\n\nBroadcasting stations are looking to capitalize on this interest in other ways as well. Happy Together, a popular entertainment show in South Korea, has a segment where their celebrity guests will cook and then share their favorite dishes with the rest of the cast. JTBC, a South Korean general cable TV network is also looking to jump on the bandwagon with a new variety show in the works. They are planning on a food-centric variety show called \"Girls Who Eat Well\" and are looking to cast girl group members from popular South Korean K-pop girl groups. Popular South Korean variety series \"Infinite Challenge\" has also showcased the phenomenon.\n\nMainstream media is not the only platform to showcase mukbang. For example, celebrities have done mukbang broadcasts as a CF to promote a food brand.\n\nMukbang has also gained international interest as well. The popular YouTube series, Youtubers React, showed various YouTube stars reacting to the South Korean trend and ended with their own mini mukbang show.\n\n"}

{"id": "6874331", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=6874331", "title": "Nero (Devil May Cry)", "text": "Nero (Devil May Cry)\n\nNero was created by Bingo Morihashi and designed by Tatsuya Yoshikawa, who wanted to make the character fit into the world while contrasting him with Dante. The character was redesigned for \"Devil May Cry 5\" to establish his relationship with Dante's father Sparda and Dante's brother Vergil based on their multiple physical similarities. Nero is voiced by Johnny Yong Bosch in English and Kaito Ishikawa in Japanese.\n\nCritical reception to Nero has been mostly positive. While game journalists found that fans would miss playing as Dante during Nero's debut, his personality and abilities would be found as appealing. His new look and actions in the upcoming \"Devil May Cry 5\" have also been praised by critics.\n\nNero was created by the Capcom staff as a new protagonist who would develop across the \"Devil May Cry\" series because Dante had become stronger with each game. Nero was created as a weak character who develops new powers in the story until he reaches Dante's level. This was mostly done through his \"Devil Bringer\" ability, which makes him stand out. Another reason for Nero's introduction was to attract new gamers to the franchise. The Devil Bringer was originally suited to be part of Dante's mechanics, but the staff found the games would be more interesting if a character who cannot transform into a demon would develop a demon arm. In the making of the game, Capcom wished to keep Nero's traits, except that Kyrie is his love interest, under wraps. Bingo Morihashi was inspired to write Nero's story by the writings of late manga artist Ramo Nakajima in the series \"Amagasaki City\"; \"I love you, so I protect the city you love\". Love is the focus of the \"Devil May Cry\" series; \"Devil May Cry 4\" focuses on Nero's love for Kyrie. While making \"Devil May Cry 4\" a simple story similar to Hollywood movies involving a damsel in distress, the staff were satisfied with the story because it also carried Morihashi's ideas well.\n\nFearing negative feedback, as happened when Konami's stealth game \"\" introduced a new character, replacing protagonist Solid Snake with newcomer Raiden, producer Hiroyuki Kobayashi stated Capcom aimed to make Nero fun to play, even when compared to Dante; they said the team aimed to make him stronger at some point. Kobayashi described Nero as \"characteristically wild, quite immature, young, and very passionate. At the same time he is kind of a rebel.\"\n\nCapcom originally planned to name their new character after the French sculptor Auguste Rodin, who created \"The Gates of Hell\" from \"Dante's Inferno\". This work is referenced in \"Devil May Cry 4\"; it causes demons to spawn within the human world. The Capcom team, however, later wanted a simpler name similar to the ones from Dante and Vergil. Writer Morihashi Bingo persuaded the staff to use the name Nero from the Roman emperor with the same name; he said the similarities between Nero and the name of Vergil's alter-ego Nero Angelo were coincidental and there is no connection between these two characters. Most of Nero's moves were named after casino terms, which Morihashi believed would fit with the character's personality.\n\nNero was designed by Tatsuya Yoshikawa who did research for the entire \"Devil May Cry\" series when designing the new main character. Yoshikawa was satisfied with Nero's appearance and he believes he fits the \"Devil May Cry\" world. Nero's physical appearance underwent several changes during the development of \"Devil May Cry 4\"; early designs looked more like Vergil until the final design that resembled Dante. Capcom wanted to balance the traits between Nero and Dante, the game's two playable characters. While Nero was created to be weak due to his young age, Dante comes across as a more experienced person based on his previous works. Existing fans would be pleased by Dante's characterization and would stop playing as Nero. Capcom had planned ideas for another \"Devil May Cry\" game, in which Nero would return and possibly team up with Dante. The company, however, first expected to see the fan response to \"Devil May Cry 4\".\n\nYoshikawa also created another devil transformation, the Devil Trigger, for Nero. Unlike Dante's transformation that makes him look like a devil, Nero's Devil Trigger generates a creature situated behind his back. The one that did not appear in the game turned Nero into a demon like Dante. Nero's hood covers one eye as a form of symbolism, which was left up to the fans. Yoshikawa wanted to incorporate this into the game and hoped to make it into a figurine, but this was not possible.\n\nNero's redesign for \"Devil May Cry 5\" was intended to contrast with Dante's older look. Capcom used an older incarnation of Nero so he would be \"at the top of his game in body and mind\". Because the graphics of the game are meant to be as realistic as possible, Nero's face was modeled after an actor named Karlo Baker. Fans of the series speculated whether Nero was related to Dante or Vergil, as in \"Devil May Cry 4\". Nero is said to be a descendant of Sparda, Dante's and Vergil's father, based on their similarities and Nero's power up, the Devil Trigger, which makes him look like Vergil's devil form. In June 2018, Capcom confirmed Nero is Vergil's son. Replacing his lost Devil Bringer, Capcom added Nero's prosthetic arm Devil Breaker, which will be important for the use of the character in combat.\n\nPlayers who purchase the Deluxe Edition of \"Devil May Cry\" will receive four Devil Breaker weapons for Nero, including a Mega Buster based on \"Mega Man 11\".\n\nNero was voiced by Johnny Yong Bosch; while having played many characters—he enjoyed playing Ichigo Kurosaki from \"Bleach\" and Vash the Stampede from \"Trigun\"—Bosch felt Nero became his favorite. The actor stated that Nero was one of his favorite characters he has ever worked because of his story and because he went to Japan to do the motion capture for Nero.\n\nIn the Japanese version of \"Devil May Cry 4: Special Edition\", an updated version of the original \"Devil May Cry 4\", Nero was given a Japanese actor; Kaito Ishikawa. When dubbing the character, Ishikawa tried following Bosch's work so he could understand Nero's personality but he found this difficult because he did not know English. While Ishikawa had no previous experience with the series before working in \"Special Edition\", his friends gave him a positive outlook at it. During the recording of the series, Ishikawa met Dante's Japanese voice actor, Toshiyuki Morikawa, with whom he interacted many times and helped him to understand the franchise. As he worked, Ishikawa gained a greater understanding of the game because it was translated in Japanese, which might attract more fans and was grateful for the experience.\n\nIshikawa said Nero is a character who encompasses the \"naughty young boy\" that everyone has experienced being. He noted Nero's interactions with the enemies show a big contrast between his and Dante's characterization. Of the two main characters, Ishikawa said he believed Nero is taking his own path rather than following Dante's steps; he enjoyed the relationship between the two characters, which he took into account when recording the game. He decided to \"cheer\" on Nero for trying to act stylishly when facing his enemies, unlike Dante, whom he took notes from seeing Morikawa's work.\n\nIn the fourth installment of the \"Devil May Cry\" series, having never knew his father, Nero's nature as Vergil's son begins to manifest when he injured himself protecting his childhood friend Kyrie from a pack of demons. Later while attending a mass at the Order of the Sword, Nero's injured arm mutated into the Devil Bringer as the result of seeing Kyrie endangered when Dante appeared and killed their religious leader Santus and what he learned were demons dressed as Order acolytes. As he made a reputation as a lone wolf, Nero is given a mission to find and capture Dante. During his journey, Nero learns that the influx of demons on the island were arranged by Sanctus and learns of his resurrect as a demon by the Order's scientist Agnus, who developed demons from reverse engineering the remains of Nelo Angelo and Vergil's Devil Arms sword . Nero escaped death as Yamato sensed its master blood in Nero, fully awakening his powers while revealing him as a descendant of Sparda.\n\nThis revelation convinces Sanctus into using Kyrie as bait to force Nero into assuming the role he intended Dante in animating the Savior colossus he created to wipe out all the demons and create a new utopia after destroying the world. But Dante sabotages Sanctus's plans and frees Nero so he can save Kyrie and destroy both Sanctus and the Savior. Despite the two being ignorant of their familial ties, Nero and Dante part on good terms with the latter allowing Nero to keep Yamato.\n\nA \"Devil May Cry 4\" novel by Bingo Morihashi expands Nero's background; he was found as a baby in Fortuna and was bullied by other children who claimed his mother was a prostitute. Nero was taken by Credo and Kyrie's family, and later joined the Order of the Sword to defeat demons, though Nero often worked alone. During the main story, Dante states he has fun interacting with Nero because Nero reminds him of his brother Vergil but cannot understand their connection. In June 2018, Capcom confirmed Nero's father is Vergil.\n\nNero will be one of the main protagonists of the upcoming game \"Devil May Cry 5\"; he is depicted as being older than in the previous game and having lost his demonic arm, he wears a prosthetic arm to fight. Nero is shown to be a member of the mobile branch of Dante's \"Devil May Cry\" business and is working alongside a woman named Nico.\n\nNero was also planned to appear in the fighting game \"Tatsunoko vs. Capcom\" but he was not available due to time constraints. He is mentioned in \"Marvel vs. Capcom 3\" by Deadpool while interacting with Dante. In the fighting game \"Street Fighter V\", Nero's original appearance serves an alternate design for Ed.\n\nNero has received many reviews from video game critics. Since his introduction in a demo, GameSpot felt the character would appeal to the series' fans, although Dante was more popular within the fandom. Dante's replacement with Nero as the new main character was the subject of controversy within the fandom; \"GameAxis Unwired\" expected he would play similarly to Dante and that his Devil Bringer power would satisfy newcomers. Nero's gamplay style was praised by IGN, which said he \"strike[s] the right tone of gravity and sarcasm\". Capsule Monster labeled Nero as \"our anti-hero with a heart\" and enjoyed the character's mechanics as much as Dante's. Despite finding Nero a likable character due to his personality, GameSpot said players would also be pleased with the switch between Nero and Dante as \"Devil May Cry 4\" progresses. Den of Geek noted that while his debut might have surprised fans of Dante, his similar appearance and distinctive style might appeal to them. GameSpy described his combat by saying, \"He has a fuel injector built in, so that he can 'rev' up his blade for charged attacks\".\n\nUS Gamer noted that despite Nero being one of the easiest characters from \"Special Edition\" to use, his combat still provides depth and that defeating the bosses was far more challenging using Nero than using Dante. While noting similarities between Nero and Dante, Metro said the former's other skills make him unique due to his swordsmanship and Devil Bringer. IGN also listed the Devil Bringer as the ninth-best weapon in the \"Devil May Cry\" series because Nero can attack any kind of enemy with his arm. Dual Shockers enjoyed Nero's combat, which it said added new depth to the series because it is different from Dante's. The website, however, dismissed Nero's story, finding it unappealing.\n\nCapcom said it would not make a bad protagonist similar to that of \"Metal Gear Solid 2\". GameZone found Nero likable based on his actions in the plot and his powers. Game Informer agreed with GameZone, stating that Nero is as likable as Dante because he \"lives up to his legacy\". \"Edge\" was more critical about his introduction because he replaced Dante while comparing him to \"God of War\" protagonist Kratos based on personality traits that make him unlikable. Despite finding Nero's improvements in abilities less enjoyable, \"Edge\" still found that players will still find Dante more appealing in the progress of the story. In the book \"1001 Video Games You Must Play Before You Die\", the author said the change to Nero from Dante was an attempt to please new gamers to the franchise because Nero performs simpler moves than Dante, who the writer said many players might have found boring due to the amount of moves and apparent decrease of sales in the series. The book describes Nero as a \"a dead ringer\" with moves similar to those of Kratos. Bosch's voice acting in the English-language version was also praised by GameZone for the way he portrays Nero, with GameSpot agreeing, calling Bosch's work \"superb acting makes for one of the most appealing new game characters to be introduced in some time\".\n\nReaction to Nero's upcoming role in \"Devil May Cry 5\" has been mostly positive. GamesRadar found Nero's actions in the \"Devil May Cry 5\" trailer appealing due to the way his character engages demons. While joking about Nero's new look, \"Metro\" enjoyed his actions in the trailer. IGN criticized Nero's appearance in \"Devil May Cry 5\", comparing it to the redesigned version of Dante by Ninja Theory as a desperate, failed attempt to appeal to gamers during the Electronic Entertainment Expo 2018. Machitery Okabe from Capcom, however, stated the response from gamers to Nero's new appearance was positive. Despite a confusing scene in the trailer in which it appears Vergil cuts Nero's arm, Kotaku was looking forward for the return of the three main characters—Dante, Vergil and Nero—in the game based on the preview. Another Kokatu writer praised Nero's new costume and his metallic arm. Daily Star found the character likable based on his personality which reminded him on the comic superhero Spider-man.\n"}

It was established in the NSW Hunter Region in 1952 to provide health insurance for workers at the BHP Steelworks, and has since grown into a national and international operation, providing health and medical insurance to more than one million Australian and New Zealand residents.\n\nIn 2007, nib became the first private health insurance fund to list on the Australian Securities Exchange (ASX).\n\nA series of meetings of eligible policyholders and company members held in Newcastle on 19 July 2007 voted overwhelmingly in favour of demutualisation of the health fund. The Federal Court of Australia then approved the vote the following week with the demutualisation completed on 5 November 2007.\n\nThe share price opened at $AUD0.85.\n\nIn 2010, nib set about expanding the business globally, entering into the international workers and international students market.\n\nTo support this expansion, nib purchased IMAN International Pty Ltd, a specialist provider of health cover for temporary migrant workers in Australia for approximately $25 million.\n\nIn November 2012, nib acquired the New Zealand health insurer, TOWER Medical Insurance Limited (TOWER Medical), for approximately NZ$102 million (Au$80 million). nib New Zealand is the country’s second largest health insurer, providing health and medical insurance to around 160,000 New Zealanders.\n\nnib established its first whitelabelling partnership in May 2014, entering a strategic distribution alliance with Apia to sell private health insurance under the Apia brand.\n\nSince then nib has been developing their whitelabelling capability further through partnerships with Qantas, Suncorp and AAMI in Australia while in New Zealand they’ve partnered with AA Health and Fairfax Media New Zealand.\n\nIn September 2014, nib partnered with leading global medical insurer AXA PPP International in launching a global health cover pilot product in New Zealand. nib global health provides comprehensive health and medical insurance cover to New Zealanders in most countries around the world. Further nib took health cover global for Aussie expats in September 2016, with the launch of nib Expatriate Health Insurance Cover.\n\nIn July 2016, nib announced the acquisition of World Nomads Group, Australia's third-largest distributor of travel insurance, for $95 million.\n\nWhile in October 2017, nib completed the acquisition of GU Health, Australia’s only established specialist corporate group health insurer, servicing over 34,000 policyholders across more than 260 corporate clients, for $155.5 million.\n\nWhitecoat is a free online search and comparison service that was developed and launched by nib in 2013.\n\nWhitecoat provides contact details and ratings information for more than 210,000 Australian healthcare providers across 40 different provider types, including dentists, optometrists, and physiotherapists. Along with providing publicly-available contact details for different healthcare providers, the Whitecoat website carries ratings information regarding availability, listening skills, explanation of treatment and likelihood to recommend as well as comments from customers about their overall service experience.\n\nIn 2014, Whitecoat allowed reviews from the public for the first time. Reviews are now sourced from Whitecoat users as well as members of affiliated private health insurers who have been provided with a billable service from the provider. It hosts more than 250,000 customer reviews and while the platform now includes allied healthcare providers such as dentists, physiotherapists, and general practitioners, it is looking to expand to include medical specialists. The site has been likened to being the 'Trip Advisor' of the healthcare sector.\n\nIn 2016, Bupa and HBF announced a joint venture with nib and signed a heads of agreement to join nib as investors and participants in expanding the Whitecoat healthcare provider platform. With the participation by Bupa and HBF along with foundation investor nib, Whitecoat will increase its reach to approximately six million Australians. When fully developed, Whitecoat will allow consumers to find, book, review and pay for healthcare treatment with their chosen provider.\n\nnib established the nib foundation in 2008, following a $25 million donation from nib health funds, raised through the issue of new shares at the time of listing nib on the Australian Securities Exchange (ASX) in November 2007. Each year, the foundation aims to provide up to $2 million in funding to support a range of Multi-Year Partners and Community Partners. Since inception, almost $16 million in grant funding has been provided to aid the development and delivery of health and wellbeing initiatives. The foundation has partnered with 100+ Australian charities at a local and national level.\n\nnib sponsors a number of major sporting organisations in Australia and New Zealand, including the Newcastle Knights (NRL), NSW State of Origin team (NRL), Auckland Blues (Super Rugby) and the Richmond Tigers (AFL).\n\nRetired rugby league player, Paul Harragon, has been the face of nib in Australia since 1991.\n\n"}

Dishes are made using pure compounds instead of using animal or plant tissues. Hervé This said the cuisine is like \"a painter using primary colours, or a musician composing electroacoustic music, wave by wave, using a computer\".\n\nAccording to Hervé This, Note by Note cuisine began in 1994. In the French edition of \"Scientific American\", This wrote that he dreamt of the day when recipes gave advice like \"add to your bouillon two drops of a 0.001 percent solution of benzylmercaptan in pure alcohol\". This said promoting the cuisine was a struggle, between 1994 and 1999 (he gave the name in 1997) and he got no remuneration out of it (and even today, he is not selling anything, nor products, or machine, or education). After 2006, he convinced his friend the French chef Pierre Gagnaire to develop Note by Note dishes, and after about one year of work, Pierre Gagnaire served the first Note by Note dish ever served in a restaurant. They presented the first Note by Note dish (\"Note à note N°1\") in Hong Kong the 26th of April 2008. Then, after more common work, Pierre Gagnaire named the second Note by Note dish called \"Chick Corea\", after the jazz pianist of the same name.\n\nIn 2012, This published \"La cuisine note à note\", where the concept of Note by Note cuisine is discussed. \n\nSince the proposal of note by note cooking, This succeeded having many places in world to organize Note by Note dinners of events. For example: \n- 2010 : lecture at the meeting of the Japan Society for the Promotion of Science, in Strasbourg, in order to invite two Alsatian cooks, Hubert Maetz and Aline Kuntz, to make two note by note dishes, that they did in front of the audience.\n\n- 2010 : at the Institute for Advanced Studies in Gastronomy, note by note educational dinner at the Ecole du Corbon bleu, in Paris. The chefs were Patrick Terrien, Patrick Caals, Frédéric Lesourd, Bruno Stril, Philippe Clergue, Marc Thivet, Franck Poupard, Patrick Lebouc, Jean-François Deguignet, Jean-Jacques Tranchant, Nicolas Bernardé (MOF), and Xavier Cotte. And the menu was the following: \nRoyale de sous bois, blanc-manger truffé et bouillon légèrement mousseux\nProfondeur iodée de poulpe et Saint-Pierre, écume et transparence de spaghettis aux cèpes\nPigeonneau en deux cuissons, sa compotée de cuisses, potimarron fondant, gelée aux polyphénols, asperges virtuelles\nMille-feuille de chèvre frais au siphon\nGuimauve en deux textures\nArdoise « This »\nSucrette glacée au parfum de Menton\n\n- 2011 : for the International Year of Chemistry, the official partner was the Dow Chemicals Company, who accepted to fund a note by note banquet, the day before the official opening at UNESCO, in Paris : the 26 th of January, the team of the catering company Potel & Chabot, under the direction of the chef Jean-Pierre Biffi, served a wonderful menu : \nSur une idée d'huitres : huitres de tapioca, bavarois d'amylopectine, tapioca de citron vert, eau de mer gelée, crème d'huitres, vapeur cristallisée\nSoufflé au homard, sauce wöhler et gelée de framboises\nFibres de bœuf, capellini, cylindres orange\nBoule de cassis\nThis menu was also served at the Michelin Star Ceremony organized by the journal L'Hôtellerie-Restauration, the same year in Paris. \n\n- October 2011, another note by note dinner was served by the chefs-teachers of the Cordon bleu School, in Paris. The chefs were Patrick Terrien, Patrick Caals, Philippe Clergue, Frédéric Lesourd, Patrick Lebouc, Franck Poupard, Bruno Stril and Marc Thivet, Jean-François Deguignet, Xavier Cotte, Nicolas Jordan and Jean-Jacques Tranchant, and the menu was: \nMille feuilles terre et mer trois couleurs, souligné des deux sauces Kientzheim et crustacés\nRecherche note à note en pot-au-feu\nReconstitution d'une mozarella, huile d'olive et mâche\nLe dessert Cordon bleu\n\n- November 2011 : the Association Toques blanches internationales was doing his first « Workshop innovation », on note by note cooking : Jean-Pierre Lepeltier (Hôtel Renaissance La Défense, Paris), David Desplanques (Hôtel Crowne Plazza République, Paris), Michael Foubert (Hôtel Renaissance Arc de Triomphe), Marie Soyez (Hôtel Renaissance La Défense, Paris), David Crenn (Hôtel Renaissance La Défense, Paris), Vincent Vitasse (Hôtel Concorde Lafayette, Paris), Julien Mercier (Hôtel Pullmann Bercy, Paris) were experimenting, after some products were shown. \n\n- December 2011 : This workshop led, this same year in December, on culinary courses given by the chefs of the same Association, during the raise funding event Téléthon: Jean-Pierre Lepeltier (Hôtel Renaissance La Défense, Paris), David Desplanques (Hôtel Crowne Plazza République, Paris), Michael Foubert (Hôtel Renaissance Arc de Triomphe), Marie Soyez (Hôtel Renaissance La Défense, Paris), David Crenn (Hôtel Renaissance La Défense, Paris), Vincent Vitasse (Hôtel Concorde Lafayette, Paris), Julien Mercier (Hôtel Pullmann Bercy, Paris) were educating public that had paid for the courses and taste the dishes. \n\n- April 2012, a series of lectures and press conferences were organized at the Institut du Tourisme et d'Hôtellerie du Québec (ITHQ), in Montreal. For the first press conference, the chef Ismael Osorio and the scientist Erik Ayala Bribiesca, along with chefs and students of ITHQ, served four bouchées note by note to about 150 journalists. \nThe next day, a note by note meal that was less « art moderne » was served to international journalists, with comments. \n\n- 2012 was also the year in which the public and free Courses on molecular gastronomy discussed note by note cooking. During three podcasted days of lectures, chefs were invited : Philippe Clergue, from le Cordon bleu, and Jean Pierre Lepeltier, the president of the Toques blanches internationales. The courses are on line on the internet site of AgroParisTech http://www2.agroparistech.fr/podcast/-Cours-2012-La-cuisine-note-a-note-.html\n\n- July 2012 : at Euroscience Open Forum, Dublin, Ireland, a lecture by Hervé This was followed by the production of note by note food samples by the chef David Desplanques. \n\n-August 2012 : note by note cooking was shown to the students of the Eramus Mundus Master Program Food Innovation and Product Design, at AgroParisTech, Paris. The chef Jean-Pierre Lepeltier (Hôtel Renaissance La Défense, Paris) came to show new note by note dishes. \n\nLater, there are too many things, such as a new workshop of the Toques blanches internationales, in August 2012, a press conference with demonstrations when the book \"La cuisine note à note en 12 questions souriantes\" was shown to the press, with dishes prepared by chefs Jean-Pierre Lepeltier, chef Hôtel Renaissance Paris La Défense, Laurent Renouf, sous chef Hôtel Renaissance Paris La Défense, Julien Lasry, chef de partie Hôtel Renaissance Paris La Défense, Marie Soyer, chef de partie Hôtel Renaissance Paris La Défense, Mickael Foubert, chef Hôtel Renaissance Arc de Triomphe, Lucille Bouche, sous chef Hôtel Renaissance Le parc Trocadéro, Yannick Jaouen (sous-chef Hôtel Mariott Rive Gauche Paris)\n\n- In 2013, the first International Contest for Note by Note Cooking took place in Paris.

The menu was :\n\"Amuses bouche\n1-cis-hexen-3-ol\ngaïacol et 2,4,6-triisobutyl-5-dihydro-4H-1,3,5-dithiazine\n2-acétylthiazole\nacétyl méthyl carbinol acétyl propionyl\npipérine\nChick Corea\nbenzaldéhyde\"\n\nNow, the most important : \n- in 2016, a lecture at the World Chefs Association, in Thessaloniki\n- in 2017, a company was created by a young French entrepreneur to sell note by note compounds. \n- in May 2017, the chef Andrea Camastra moved to full Note by Note, in his restaurant Senses, in Warsaw, Poland\n- in February 2018, a 100 % Note by Note Dinner served by the Alsatian chef Julien Binz (Michelin Star), in Ammerschwihr, Alsace (France)\n- in April 2018, a Note by Note Dinner at the Culinary School Le Monde, Athens, Greece\n- in July 2018, two Note by Note Dinners served by chefs of the At-Sunrice Global Chef Academy, in Singapore, to Ministers, Ambassadors and other distinguished guests\n\nNow, note by note is regularly taught in some universities, including AgroParisTech and the Dublin Institute of Technology, whereas the International contest goes on every year at AgroParisTech.\n\nIngredients used in Note by Note cuisine are called compounds, which include water, ethanol, sucrose, protein, amino acids and lipids. For example, in the \"wölher sauce\" made by Note by Note cuisine, the following might be added: water, anthocyanins (for colour), sugars, ethanol, amino acids (for flavour), glycerol, phenols, quinones, and organic acids.\n\n"}
{"id": "1086440", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1086440", "title": "Ornithine transcarbamylase deficiency", "text": "Ornithine transcarbamylase deficiency\n\nOrnithine transcarbamylase deficiency (or OTC deficiency) is the most common urea cycle disorder in humans. It is an inherited disorder which causes toxic levels of ammonia to build up in the blood.\n\nOrnithine transcarbamylase, the defective enzyme in this disorder, is the final enzyme in the proximal portion of the urea cycle. It is responsible for converting carbamoyl phosphate and ornithine into citrulline. OTC deficiency is inherited in an X-linked recessive manner, meaning males are more commonly affected than females.\n\nIn severely affected individuals, ammonia concentrations increase rapidly, causing ataxia, lethargy, and death without rapid intervention. OTC deficiency is diagnosed using a combination of clinical findings and biochemical testing, while confirmation is often done using molecular genetics techniques.\n\nOnce an individual has been diagnosed, the treatment goal is to avoid precipitating episodes that can cause an increased ammonia concentration. The most common treatment combines a low protein diet with nitrogen scavenging agents. Liver transplant is considered curative for this disease. Experimental trials of gene therapy using adenoviral vectors resulted in the death of one participant, Jesse Gelsinger, and have been discontinued.\n\nOTC deficiency can become apparent at any age. Early-onset OTC deficiency is most commonly found in males. Later in life, the disease may present in both males and females. \n\nIn the classic presentation, a male infant appears well initially, but by the second day of life becomes irritable, lethargic, and stops feeding. Infants may have poorly-controlled body temperature and respiratory rates, and may experience seizures. Without urgent intervention, a metabolic encephalopathy develops; this can progress to coma and death within the first week of life. High levels of ammonia cause preferential damage to the brain, leading to devastating consequences.\n\nLater onset forms of OTC deficiency can have variable presentations. Although late onset forms of the disease are often considered milder than the classic infantile presentation, any affected individual is at risk for an episode of hyperammonemia that could still be life-threatening if presented with the appropriate stressors. These patients will often present with headaches, nausea, vomiting, delirium, erratic behavior, or seizures. A detailed dietary history of an affected individual with undiagnosed OTC deficiency will often reveal a history of protein avoidance.\n\nThe prognosis of a patient with severe OTC deficiency is well correlated with the length of the hyperammonemic period rather than the degree of hyperammonemia or the presence of other symptoms, such as seizures. Even for patients with late onset forms of the disease, their overall clinical picture is dependent on the extent of hyperammonemia they have experienced, even if it has remained unrecognized.\n\nOTC deficiency is caused by mutations in the \"OTC\" gene, which is located on the X chromosome. \"OTC\" codes for the mitochondrial enzyme ornithine transcarbamylase, which is expressed only in liver. The functional enzyme consists of three identical subunits. OTC is the last enzyme in the proximal portion of the urea cycle, which consists of the reactions that take place in the mitochondria. The substrates of the reaction catalyzed by ornithine transcarbamylase are ornithine and carbamyl phosphate, while the product is citrulline.\n\nThere are no common mutations that cause disease, however 10 - 15% of disease causing mutations are deletions. It is inherited in an X-linked recessive manner, meaning males are more commonly affected than females. Females who carry a defective copy of the gene can be severely affected or asymptomatic, largely depending on the random nature of X-inactivation. There is some degree of genotype - phenotype correlation with OTC deficiency, but this depends on a number of situations. Individuals with milder mutations, often associated with late onset disease can still present with severe illness when exposed to sufficient metabolic stress. Correlations are more difficult to ascertain in females, since the residual activity of OTC in the liver is impacted not only by the nature of the mutation, but also by the random pattern of X-inactivation. OTC deficiency is estimated to be the most common urea cycle disorder. An exact incidence is difficult to calculate, due to the varying clinical presentations of later onset forms of the disease. Early estimates of the incidence were as high as 1:14,000 live births, however later studies have decreased these estimates to approximately 1:60,000 - 1:72,000.\n\nIn individuals with marked hyperammonemia, a urea cycle disorder is usually high on the list of possible causes. While the immediate focus is lowering the patient's ammonia concentrations, identifying the specific cause of increased ammonia levels is key as well.\n\nDiagnostic testing for OTC deficiency, or any individual with hyperammonemia involves plasma and urine amino acid analysis, urine organic acid analysis (to identify the presence or absence of orotic acid, as well as rule out an organic acidemia) and plasma acylcarnitines (will be normal in OTC deficiency, but can identify some other causes of hyperammonemia). An individual with untreated OTC deficiency will show decreased citrulline and arginine concentrations (because the enzyme block is proximal to these intermediates) and increased orotic acid. The increased orotic acid concentrations result from the buildup of carbamoyl phosphate. This biochemical phenotype (increased ammonia, low citrulline and increased orotic acid) is classic for OTC deficiency, but can also be seen in neonatal presentations of ornithine aminotransferase deficiency. Only severely affected males consistently demonstrate this classic biochemical phenotype.\n\nHeterozygous females can be difficult to diagnose. With the rise of sequencing techniques, molecular testing has become preferred, particularly when the disease causing mutations in the family are known. Historically, heterozygous females were often diagnosed using an allopurinol challenge. In a female with reduced enzyme activity, an oral dose of allopurinol would be metabolized to oxypurinol ribonucleotide, which blocks the pyrimidine biosynthetic pathway. When this induced enzymatic block is combined with reduced physiologic enzyme activity as seen in heterozygotes, the elevation of orotic acid could be used to differentiate heterozygotes from unaffected individuals. This test was not universally effective, as it had both false negative and false positive results.\n\nOrnithine transcarbamylase is only expressed in the liver, thus performing an enzyme assay to confirm the diagnosis requires a liver biopsy. Before molecular genetic testing was commonly available, this was one of the only methods for confirmation of a suspected diagnosis. In cases where prenatal diagnosis was requested, a fetal liver biopsy used to be required to confirm if a fetus was affected. Modern molecular techniques have eliminated this need, and gene sequencing is now the preferred method of diagnosis in asymptomatic family members after the diagnosis has been confirmed in a proband.\n\nThe treatment goal for individuals affected with OTC deficiency is the avoidance of hyperammonemia. This can be accomplished through a strictly controlled low-protein diet, as well as preventative treatment with nitrogen scavenging agents such as sodium benzoate. The goal is to minimize the nitrogen intake while allowing waste nitrogen to be excreted by alternate pathways. Arginine is typically supplemented as well, in an effort to improve the overall function of the urea cycle. If a hyperammonemic episode occurs, the aim of treatment is to reduce the individual's ammonia levels as soon as possible. In extreme cases, this can involve hemodialysis.\n\nGene therapy had been considered a possibility for curative treatment for OTC deficiency, and clinical trials were taking place at the University of Pennsylvania in the late 1990s. These were halted after the death of Jesse Gelsinger, a young man taking part in a phase I trial using an adenovirus vector. Currently, the only option for curing OTC deficiency is a liver transplant, which restores normal enzyme activity. A 2005 review of 51 patients with OTC deficiency who underwent liver transplant estimated 5-year survival rates of greater than 90%. Severe cases of OTC deficiency are typically evaluated for liver transplant by 6 months of age.\n\nA 1999 retrospective study of 74 cases of neonatal onset found that 32 (43%) patients died during their first hyperammonemic episode. Of those who survived, less than 20% survived to age 14. Few of these patients received liver transplants.\n\nEven with proper identification and treatment, the majority of patients who present in the neonatal period have severe neurological and intellectual impairments. Liver transplantation cannot cure brain damage which has already occurred, but it will prevent future hyperammonemic episodes and prevent further damage.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "240096", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=240096", "title": "Photokeratitis", "text": "Photokeratitis\n\nPhotokeratitis or ultraviolet keratitis is a painful eye condition caused by exposure of insufficiently protected eyes to the ultraviolet (UV) rays from either natural (e.g. intense sunlight) or artificial (e.g. the electric arc during welding) sources. Photokeratitis is akin to a sunburn of the cornea and conjunctiva, and is not usually noticed until several hours after exposure. Symptoms include increased tears and a feeling of pain, likened to having sand in the eyes.\n\nThe injury may be prevented by wearing eye protection that blocks most of the ultraviolet radiation, such as welding goggles with the proper filters, a welder's helmet, sunglasses rated for sufficient UV protection, or appropriate snow goggles. The condition is usually managed by removal from the source of ultraviolet radiation, covering the corneas, and administration of pain relief. Photokeratitis is known by a number of different terms including: snow blindness, arc eye, welder's flash, bake eyes, corneal flash burns, sand man's eye, flash burns, niphablepsia, potato eye, or keratoconjunctivitis photoelectrica.\n\nCommon symptoms include pain, intense tears, eyelid twitching, discomfort from bright light, and constricted pupils.\n\nAny intense exposure to UV light can lead to photokeratitis. Common causes include welders who have failed to use adequate eye protection such as an appropriate welding helmet or welding goggles. This is termed \"arc eye\", while photokeratitis caused by exposure to sunlight reflected from ice and snow, particularly at elevation, is commonly called \"snow blindness\". It can also occur due to using tanning beds without proper eyewear. Natural sources include bright sunlight reflected from snow or ice or, less commonly, from sea or sand. Fresh snow reflects about 80% of the UV radiation compared to a dry, sandy beach (15%) or sea foam (25%). This is especially a problem in polar regions and at high altitudes, as with every thousand feet (approximately 305 meters) of elevation (above sea level), the intensity of UV rays increases by four percent.\n\nFluorescein dye staining will reveal punctate areas of uptake under ultraviolet light.\n\nPhotokeratitis can be prevented by using sunglasses or eye protection that transmits 5–10% of visible light and absorbs almost all UV rays. Additionally, these glasses should have large lenses and side shields to avoid incidental light exposure. Sunglasses should always be worn, even when the sky is overcast, as UV rays can pass through clouds.\n\nThe Inuit, Yupik, and other Arctic peoples carved snow goggles from materials such as driftwood or caribou antlers to help prevent snow blindness. Curved to fit the user's face with a large groove cut in the back to allow for the nose, the goggles allowed in a small amount of light through a long thin slit cut along their length. The goggles were held to the head by a cord made of caribou sinew.\n\nIn the event of missing sunglass lenses, emergency lenses can be made by cutting slits in dark fabric or tape folded back onto itself. The \"SAS Survival Guide\" recommends blackening the skin underneath the eyes with charcoal (as the ancient Egyptians did) to avoid any further reflection.\n\nThe pain may be temporarily alleviated with anaesthetic eye drops for the examination; however, they are not used for continued treatment, as anaesthesia of the eye interferes with corneal healing, and may lead to corneal ulceration and even loss of the eye. Cool, wet compresses over the eyes and artificial tears may help local symptoms when the feeling returns. Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) eyedrops are widely used to lessen inflammation and eye pain, but have not been proven in rigorous trials. Systemic (oral) pain medication is given if discomfort is severe. Healing is usually rapid (24–72 hours) if the injury source is removed. Further injury should be avoided by isolation in a dark room, removing contact lenses, not rubbing the eyes, and wearing sunglasses until the symptoms improve.\n\n"}

The tablet is positioned, and the blade pressed down to split it. With care it is often possible to cut a tablet into quarters. Also available as consumer items are \"multiple pill splitters\", which cut numerous round or oblong pills in one operation.\n\nA drug manufacturer may score pills with a groove to both indicate that a pill may be split and to aid the practice of splitting pills. When manufacturers do create grooves in pills, the groove must be consistent for consumers to be able to use them effectively. Many manufacturers choose to not use grooves. The United States government Center for Drug Evaluation and Research makes the following recommendations for manufacturers when scoring pills with grooves:\n\nIn the U.S. \"uniformity of dosage units\" is defined by the United States Pharmacopeia (USP), which describes itself as \"the official public standards-setting authority for all prescription and over-the-counter medicines, dietary supplements, and other healthcare products manufactured and sold in the United States.\" More than 140 countries develop or rely upon US pharmaceutical standards according to the USP.\n\nThe USP standard for dosage uniformity expresses statistical criteria in the complex language of sampling protocols. The pharmaceutical dosage literature sometimes boils this down as requiring a standard deviation in dosage weight of less than 6%, which roughly corresponds to the weaker rule-of-thumb offered for public consumption that the vast majority of dosage units should be within 15% of the dosage target. \"Dosage unit\" is a technical term which covers oral medications (tablets, pills, capsules), as well as non-oral delivery methods.\n\nA 2002 study of pill-splitting as conducted in four American long-term care facilities determined that 15 of the 22 dispensed prescriptions evaluated (68%) had fragment weight variance in excess of USP standards.\n\nPill-splitting can be used to save money on pharmaceutical costs, as many prescription pharmaceuticals are sold at prices less than proportional to the dose. For example, a 10 mg tablet of a drug might be sold for the same or nearly the same price as a 5 mg tablet. Splitting 10 mg tablets allows the patient to purchase half the number of tablets at a lower price than the same weight of 5 mg tablets.\n\nBoth specialist and generalist physicians are not sufficiently aware of and do not communicate with patients about the cost to them of medication.\n\nRandall Stafford of the Stanford School of Medicine published a study in 2002 of common prescription medications in the United States in which he evaluates pill splitting for \"potential cost savings and clinical appropriateness\". The study identifies eleven prescription medications that satisfied the study criteria, based on the American pharmaceutical cost structure, pill formulation, and dosages of the time. Most of the medications listed in the table from the psychiatric drug class are antidepressants.\n\nNot all tablets split equally well. In a 2002 study, Paxil, Zestril and Zoloft split cleanly with 0% rejects. Glucophage was described as a hard tablet, requiring significant force, causing tablet halves to fly. Glyburide exhibited very poor splitting with many splitting into multiple pieces. Hydrodiuril and Oretic crumbled. Lipitor did not split cleanly, and the coating peeled. The diamond shaped Viagra tablets made location of the midline difficult. The worst result reported was Oretic 25 mg in which 60% of tablets failed to split to within 15% of target weight.\n\nSome drugs have few different uses, and are usually sold in different packages and different doses for different applications. The price for some applications may be very different from that for other purposes. One example is Minoxidil, which is well known as a hair-growth stimulant; the same drug under the name Loniten is used for blood pressure control in much larger doses at a much lower price per unit weight.\n\nThe Food and Drug Administration has called pill splitting \"risky\". At the same time, the FDA approves the manufacture of pills which are intended to be split.\n\nSplitting pills may result in uneven splitting and creating pieces which will not deliver accurate dosage. Pills which are split might not be correctly halved, making the cut pieces unequal in size. Some pills are difficult to split. Some pills (particularly some time release drugs) are unsafe to split, and there could be mistakes in identifying when pills should not be split.\n\nIn a California court filing dated April 2001, Trial Lawyers for Public Justice (TLPJ) brought a class-action lawsuit against Kaiser Permanente (\"Timmis v. Kaiser Permanente\") on the grounds that \"Kaiser's mandatory pill-splitting policy endangers patients' health solely to enhance the HMO's profits\" in violation of the California Unfair Competition Law (UCL) and the California Consumer Legal Remedies Act (CLRA). In December 2004, the California Court of Appeal affirmed the trial court ruling that Kaiser's policy did not violate UCL or CLRA, noting the suit had failed to present evidence that the policy was unsafe.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "1910626", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1910626", "title": "Royal Commission on the Future of Health Care in Canada", "text": "Royal Commission on the Future of Health Care in Canada\n\nThe Royal Commission on the Future of Health Care in Canada, also known as the Romanow Report, is a committee study led by Roy Romanow on the future of health care in Canada. It was delivered in December 2002.\n\nRomanow recommended sweeping changes to ensure the long-term sustainability of Canada's health care system. The proposed changes were outlined in the Commission's Final Report, Building on Values: The Future of Health Care in Canada, which was tabled in the House of Commons on 28 November 2002.\n\nAlthough the Report of the Royal Commission dealt with a wide range of issues, much of the early attention was paid to the recommendations with respect to the financing of health care in Canada and especially transfers from the federal government to provincial and territorial governments.\n\nThe Report set the stage for another round of federal-provincial/territorial bargaining leading to a significant agreement in September 2004 whereby the Government of Canada agreed to transfer an additional $41 billion over the next 10 years in support of an action plan on health. The new funding is meant to strengthen ongoing federal health support provided through the Canada Health Transfer (CHT) as well as focus resources on addressing the fact that Canadians, like citizens in other OECD countries, often have significant wait times for access to essential health care services.\n\nThe report identifies significant problems in the way that aboriginal health is managed. Surprisingly, this is largely not due to a lack of funding; there is simply a mismanagement of assets. Funding sources are fragmented and there is no established system to provide care. In addition, there are extensive equity concerns due to this fragmentation of funding and differential care available to different Aboriginal communities.\n\nAs a result, the report suggests that new administration procedures be put in place. Integration of on-reserve healthcare into the current system is not a popular option amongst aboriginal leaders, although serves as a reasonable option for urban aboriginal healthcare. Specifically, the report suggests the formation of Aboriginal Partnerships that are an administrative authority composed of representatives from different levels of government and the aboriginal community.\n\nThese partnerships may work in a method similar to a regional health authority. They will serve as an organization with a specific health goal, such as organizing the public health and primary care for a community. The partnership will be granted federal funds to pursue these health goals in a manner that Partnership executives agree upon. Aboriginal representation in the Partnership ensures that these services are fitting with the cultural needs of the Aboriginal community. Partnerships will also interface with the existing health system to coordinate access to resources such as diagnostics and specialized care.\n\nIn an urban setting, the Partnership will serve as a voluntary health organization that coordinates access to specific health facilities such as primary care and diagnostics. The Partnership will have similar representation from Aboriginal community ensuring that services provided in the urban environment are still sensitive to Aboriginal cultural and linguistic concerns. Partnerships are especially needed in urban settings due to the specific needs of urban Aboriginals for problems such as diabetes and addiction. Furthermore, Partnerships may serve as an additional urban community organization that interfaces with other such Aboriginal organizations to serve as activists for the socioeconomic status of Aboriginals.\n\nAn important point stressed by the Romanow report is that healthcare initiatives must be accountable towards the taxpayer and consumer. Aboriginal health is no different; Partnerships must be closely monitored and their effect on health outcomes determined. Changes in policy may be necessitated as this is a new approach.\n\nThe conclusion of the Report set out 47 recommendations along with a timetable for their implementation.\n\nRecommendation 1 – A new Canadian Health Covenant should be established as a common declaration of Canadians’ and their governments’ commitment to a universally accessible, publicly funded health care system. To this end, First Ministers should meet at the earliest opportunity to agree on this Covenant.\n\nRecommendation 2 – A Health Council of Canada should be established by the provincial, territorial and federal governments to facilitate co-operation and provide national leadership in achieving the best health outcomes in the world. The Health Council should be built on the existing infrastructure of the Canadian Institute for Health Information (CIHI) and the Canadian Coordinating Office of Health Technology Assessment (CCOHTA).\n\nRecommendation 3 – On an initial basis, the Health Council of Canada should: Establish common indicators and measure the performance of the health care system; Establish benchmarks, collect information and report publicly on efforts to improve quality, access and outcomes in the health care system; and coordinate existing activities in health technology assessment and conduct independent evaluations of technologies, including their impact on rural and remote delivery and the patterns of practice for various health care providers.\n\nRecommendation 4 – In the longer term, the Health Council of Canada should provide ongoing advice and coordination in transforming primary health care, developing national strategies for Canada’s health workforce, and resolving disputes under a modernized Canada Health Act.\n\nRecommendation 5 – The Canada Health Act should be modernized and strengthened by: Confirming the principles of public administration, universality and accessibility, updating the principles of portability and comprehensiveness, and establishing a new principle of accountability; Expanding insured health services beyond hospital and physician services to immediately include targeted home care services followed by prescription drugs in the longer term; Clarifying coverage in terms of diagnostic services; Including an effective dispute resolution process; and Establishing a dedicated health transfer directly connected to the principles and conditions of the Canada Health Act.\n\nRecommendation 6 – To provide adequate funding, a new dedicated cash-only Canada Health Transfer should be established by the federal government. To provide long-term stability and predictability, the Transfer should include an escalator that is set in advance for five year periods.\n\nRecommendation 7 – On a short-term basis, the federal government should provide targeted funding for the next two years to establish: a new Rural and Remote Access Fund; a new Diagnostic Services Fund; a Primary Health Care Transfer; a Home Care Transfer; and a Catastrophic Drug Transfer\n\nRecommendation 8 – A personal electronic health record for each Canadian that builds upon the work currently underway in provinces and territories.\n\nRecommendation 9 – Canada Health Infoway should continue to take the lead on this initiative and be responsible for developing a pan-Canadian electronic health record framework built upon provincial systems, including ensuring the interoperability of current electronic health information systems and addressing issues such as security standards and harmonizing privacy policies.\n\nRecommendation 10 – Individual Canadians should have ownership over their personal health information, ready access to their personal health records, clear protection of the privacy of their health records, and better access to comprehensive and credible information about health, health care and the health system.\n\nRecommendation 11 – Amendments should be made to the Criminal Code to protect Canadians’ privacy and to explicitly prevent the abuse or misuse of personal health information, with violations in this area considered a criminal offense.\n\nRecommendation 12 – Canada Health Infoway should support health literacy by developing and maintaining an electronic health information base to link Canadians to health information that is properly researched, trustworthy and credible as well as support more widespread efforts to promote good health.\n\nRecommendation 13 – The Health Council of Canada should take action to streamline technology assessment in Canada, increase the effectiveness, efficiency and scope of technology assessment, and enhance the use of this assessment in guiding decisions.\n\nRecommendation 14 – Steps should be taken to bridge current knowledge gaps in applied policy areas, including rural and remote health, health human resources, health promotion, and pharmaceutical policy.\n\nRecommendation 15 – A portion of the proposed Rural and Remote Access Fund, the Diagnostic Services Fund, the Primary Health Care Transfer, and the Home Care Transfer should be used to improve the supply and distribution of health care providers, encourage changes to their scopes and patterns of practice, and ensure that the best use is made of the mix of skills of different health care providers.\n\nRecommendation 16 – The Health Council of Canada should systematically collect, analyze and regularly report on relevant and necessary information about the Canadian health workforce, including critical issues related to the recruitment, distribution, and remuneration of health care providers.\n\nRecommendation 17 – The Health Council of Canada should review existing education and training programs and provide recommendations to the provinces and territories on more integrated education programs for preparing health care providers, particularly for primary health care settings.\n\nRecommendation 18 – The Health Council of Canada should develop a comprehensive plan for addressing issues related to the supply, distribution, education and training, remuneration, skills and patterns of practice for Canada’s health workforce.\n\nRecommendation 19 – The proposed Primary Health Care Transfer should be used to “fast-track” primary health care implementation. Funding should be conditional on provinces and territories moving ahead with primary health care reflecting four essential building blocks – continuity of care, early detection and action, better information on needs and outcomes, and new and stronger incentives to achieve transformation.\n\nRecommendation 20 – The Health Council of Canada should sponsor a National Summit on Primary Health Care within two years to mobilize concerted action across the country, assess early results, and identify actions that must be taken to remove obstacles to primary health care implementation.\n\nRecommendation 21 – The Health Council of Canada should play a leadership role in following up on the outcomes of the Summit, measuring and tracking progress, sharing information and comparing Canada’s results to leading countries around the world, and reporting to Canadians on the progress of implementing primary health care in Canada.\n\nRecommendation 22 – Prevention of illness and injury, and promotion of good health should be strengthened with the initial objective of making Canada a world leader in reducing tobacco use and obesity.\n\nRecommendation 23 – All governments should adopt and implement the strategy developed by the Federal, Provincial and Territorial Ministers Responsible for Sport, Recreation and Fitness to improve physical activity in Canada.\n\nRecommendation 24 – A national immunization strategy should be developed to ensure that all children are immunized against serious illnesses and Canada is well prepared to address potential problems from new and emerging infectious diseases.\n\nRecommendation 25 – Provincial and territorial governments should use the new Diagnostic Services Fund to improve access to medical diagnostic services.\n\nRecommendation 26 – Provincial and territorial governments should take immediate action to manage wait lists more effectively by implementing centralized approaches, setting standardized criteria, and providing clear information to patients on how long they can expect to wait.\n\nRecommendation 27 – Working with the provinces and territories, the Health Council of Canada should establish a national framework for measuring and assessing the quality and safety of Canada’s health care system, comparing the outcomes with other OECD countries, and reporting regularly to Canadians.\n\nRecommendation 28 – Governments, regional health authorities, health care providers, hospitals and community organizations should work together to identify and respond to the needs of official language minority communities.\n\nRecommendation 29 – Governments, regional health authorities, and health care providers should continue their efforts to develop programs and services that recognize the different health care needs of men and women, visible minorities, people with disabilities, and new Canadians.\n\nRecommendation 30 – The Rural and Remote Access Fund should be used to attract and retain health care providers.\n\nRecommendation 31 – A portion of the Rural and Remote Access Fund should be used to support innovative ways of expanding rural experiences for physicians, nurses and other health care providers as part of their education and training.\n\nRecommendation 32 – The Rural and Remote Access Fund should be used to support the expansion of telehealth approaches.\n\nRecommendation 33 – The Rural and Remote Access Fund should be used to support innovative ways of delivering health care services to smaller communities and to improve the health of people in those communities.\n\nRecommendation 34 – The proposed new Home Care Transfer should be used to support expansion of the Canada Health Act to include medically necessary home care services in the following areas: Home mental health case management and intervention services should immediately be included in the scope of medically necessary services covered under the Canada Health Act; Home care services for post-acute patients, including coverage for medication management and rehabilitation services, should be included under the Canada Health Act; and palliative home care services to support people in their last six months of life should also be included under the Canada Health Act.\n\nRecommendation 35 – Human Resources Development Canada, in conjunction with Health Canada should be directed to develop proposals to provide direct support to informal caregivers to allow them to spend time away from work to provide necessary home care assistance at critical times.\n\nRecommendation 36 – The proposed new Catastrophic Drug Transfer should be used to reduce disparities in coverage across the country by covering a portion of the rapidly growing costs of provincial and territorial drug plans.\n\nRecommendation 37 – A new National Drug Agency should be established to evaluate and approve new prescription drugs, provide ongoing evaluation of existing drugs, negotiate and contain drug prices, and provide comprehensive, objective and accurate information to health care providers and to the public.\n\nRecommendation 38 – Working collaboratively with the provinces and territories, the National Drug Agency should create a national prescription drug formulary based on a transparent and accountable evaluation and priority-setting process.\n\nRecommendation 39 – A new program on medication management should be established to assist Canadians with chronic and some life-threatening illnesses. The program should be integrated with primary health care approaches across the country.\n\nRecommendation 40 – The National Drug Agency should develop standards for the collection and dissemination of prescription drug data on drug utilization and outcomes.\n\nRecommendation 41 – The federal government should immediately review the pharmaceutical industry practices related to patent protection, specifically, the practices of evergreening and the notice of compliance regulations. This review should ensure that there is an appropriate balance between the protection of intellectual property and the need to contain costs and provide Canadians with improved access to non-patented prescription drugs.\n\nRecommendation 42 – Current funding for Aboriginal health services provided by the federal, provincial and territorial governments and Aboriginal organizations should be pooled into single consolidated budgets in each province and territory to be used to integrate Aboriginal health care services, improve access, and provide adequate, stable and predictable funding.\n\nRecommendation 43 – The consolidated budgets should be used to fund new Aboriginal Health Partnerships that would be responsible for developing policies, providing services and improving the health of Aboriginal peoples. These partnerships could take many forms and should reflect the needs, characteristics and circumstances of the population served.\n\nRecommendation 44 – Federal and provincial governments should prevent potential challenges to Canada’s health care system by: Ensuring that any future reforms they implement are protected under the definition of “public services” included in international law or trade agreements to which Canada is party; and reinforcing Canada’s position that the right to regulate health care policy should not be subject to claims for compensation from foreign-based companies.\n\nRecommendation 45 – The federal government should build alliances with other countries, especially with members of the World Trade Organization, to ensure that future international trade agreements, agreements on intellectual property, and labour standards make explicit allowance for both maintaining and expanding publicly insured, financed and delivered health care.\n\nRecommendation 46 – The federal government should play a more active leadership role in international efforts to assist developing nations in strengthening their health care systems through foreign aid and development programs. Particular emphasis should be placed on training health care providers and on public health initiatives.\n\nRecommendation 47 – Provincial, territorial and federal governments and health organizations should reduce their reliance on recruiting health care professionals from developing countries.\n\n\nNote that most of these references are from the Romanow Report; this report is available here http://publications.gc.ca/site/eng/237274/publication.html.

The rankings are presented in the Mothers’ Index, which has been produced annually since the year 2000.\n\nThe 2014 report focuses on saving mothers and children in humanitarian crises. It finds that over half the 800 maternal and 18,000 child deaths every day take place in fragile settings which are at high risk of conflict and are particularly vulnerable to the effects of natural disasters.\n\nThe 2014 report ranks Finland the number one place to be a mother. Somalia in the Horn of Africa replaced Democratic Republic of the Congo (ranking 178th) as the worst place in the world to be a mother. The United States is down one spot from 2013, ranking 31st. Statistics show that 1 in 27 women from the bottom ranking countries will die from pregnancy-related causes. In addition, 1 in 7 children will die before his or her fifth birthday.\n\n\nAn original analysis by Save the Children estimates that within the first month of life, more than 1 million babies could be saved each year with universal access to these products, which cost between 13 cents and $6 each and are ready for rapid scale-up now. The products are: \n\n\n\nStunting - Stunting is when a child is too short for their age. It is caused by poor diet and frequent infections. Generally, stunting occurs before the age of 2, with largely irreversible effects. These effects include: delayed motor development, impaired cognitive function, and poor performance in school.\n\nWasting - Wasting is when a child's weight is too low for their height. Wasting is caused by acute malnutrition. It is a strong predictor of mortality for children under 5 years old. Usually, it is caused by either food shortage or disease.\n\nUnderweight - When a child is underweight, the child's weight is too low for their age. Being underweight can mean the child is stunted, wasted or both. Weight is an indicator of short-term undernutrition. A deficit in height (i.e. stunting) is difficult to correct but a deficit in weight (i.e. underweight) can be resolved if nutrition and health are improved later in childhood.\n\nMicronutrient deficiency - Micronutrient deficiency is when a child is lacking essential vitamins or minerals such as Vitamin A, iron, and zinc. These deficiencies are caused by a long-term lack of nutritious food or they can be caused by infections such as worms.\n\nThere are 171 million children (17%) globally who do not have the opportunity to reach their full potential. This is due to not only the physical, but the mental effects of poor nutrition in the earliest months of life. \n\nOut of 171 countries, Iceland is first and Somalia is last.\n\nMore than half of the world's children do not have access to the \"Lifesaving Six\": iron folate, breastfeeding, complementary feeding, vitamin A, zinc, and hygiene. \n\nVitamin A\n\nZinc\n\nHygiene\n\nBreastfeeding\n\nNorway \n\nNiger \n\nNorway \n\nAfghanistan \n\n\nNorway \n\nAfghanistan \n\nThe reports have been widely covered in the world press, with attention for local strengths and weaknesses. For example, in 2010 \"USA Today\" focused on the low ranking of the U.S. (28th place, below Estonia, Latvia, and Croatia) due to high rates of maternal and infant mortality, low preschool enrollment, and a particularly weak maternal leave benefit. It quoted the report: \"ABC News\" interviewed physicians and nonprofit leaders who questioned whether global comparisons could be made reliably, due to possible differences in the definition of ectopic pregnancy, stillbirth, and abortion statistics. Relevant factors may include lack of health insurance, illegal immigration by women with poor prenatal care, and maternal obesity statistics. According to Michael Katz, a senior vice president at the March of Dimes Foundation, \"The major question I would ask is, 'Why do African American populations have worse results than the white population?'\"\nPravda.ru and Sify picked up an IANS/EFE report focusing on Cuba's rating as the best place to be a mother in the developing world. The \"Herald Sun\" boasted Australia's second-best placement for mothers, quoting a happy mother about hospital, maternal and child health support, and 12-month workplace maternal leave. However, the \"Adelaide Advertiser\" focused on Australia's lower [28th] ranking on the Children's Index, due in part to a child mortality rate three times higher for aboriginal infants. It quoted Save The Children's Annie Pettitt:\n\nAn editorial in the \"Philippine Daily Inquirer\" discussed explanations for the Philippine's 48th-place ranking in the second tier. The column attributed much of the problem to a \"brain drain\", though it described as \"much too high\" the SOWM report's figure that 85% of Filipino nurses leave to pursue better pay and standards of living overseas. It questioned standards at \"diploma mills\" and called for incentives to bring health professionals into poor communities, while criticizing the chilling effects of a \"raid on a training session of health-care workers\" as subversives in Morong, Rizal. The Philippines local chapter of Save the Children produced a \"State of Filipino Mothers\" report in 2008 with rankings by province.\n\n\"The Times of India\" lamented India's 73rd of 77th place in the second tier, describing a critical shortage of 74,000 accredited social health activists and 21,066 auxiliary nurse midwives below governmental norms and that thousands of women were dying because they could not access the most basic healthcare facilities or that, if they were available, they were low quality.\n\nThough data for some countries are not known with much certainty, the \"SOWM 2010\" report had many findings in common with a recent study published in \"The Lancet\", which found that 23 of 181 countries are on track to achieve Millennium Development Goal 5 of a 75% reduction in maternal mortality rate between 1990 and 2015.\n\nThe 2010 report was released by Save the Children in Canada on May 4, 10:00 a.m., as a part of an action directed toward members of Parliament in support of an announcement by Prime Minister Stephen Harper that child and maternal health would be the top priority at the 36th G8 summit in Huntsville, Ontario in June. As described in the press release:\nThe list is incomplete and only includes the top 35 countries.\n\"Notes\"\n\n\n"}

Gawker raised money to buy the video, but were unable to acquire the video when the seller broke off contact. On October 31, 2013, Toronto Police announced that they were in possession of the video, \"and at least one other\". The video was retrieved in the course of an investigation of drug gangs, entitled \"Project Traveller\". Ford's associate Sandro Lisi was charged with extortion for attempting to retrieve the video, in exchange for marijuana.\n\nAn image was provided to Gawker and \"Toronto Star\" reporters depicting Ford posing with three individuals outside the house where the alleged video was recorded. The individuals standing with Ford were later identified as Anthony Smith, Muhammad Khattak and Monir Kassim, three alleged members of a local gang. The location was later identified as a house on Windsor Road in the Etobicoke area of Toronto. Khattak and Kassim were both arrested in a sweep of an apartment complex near the home in June 2013. Smith was killed in a shooting on the streets of downtown Toronto in March 2013. The home was identified as the residence of a friend of Ford's from his high school days. The home was attacked in a home invasion days after Gawker and the \"Toronto Star\" published the video story.\n\nFord consistently denied the existence of the video, and denied that he uses crack cocaine. He remained mayor although several members of Toronto City Council, as well as the editorial boards of the \"National Post\" and \"Toronto Sun\" and \"Toronto Star\", called for him to step down. The crisis led to the firing of the Mayor's chief of staff and the resignation of a half-dozen of his staff. After the police announcement, Ford announced that he would not resign from office.\n\nOn November 5, 2013, Ford admitted to smoking crack cocaine \"probably in one of my drunken stupors\", admitted to hiding his drug abuse from his family, his staff and the people of Toronto, but pledged to continue on as Mayor. On April 30, 2014, a second video showing Ford smoking crack emerged. Ford took a leave of absence to enter drug rehabilitation from May 1 through June 30, 2014. The original video of Ford smoking crack was released by the Toronto Police Service on August 11, 2016, after Ford's death and the extortion charge against Sandro Lisi was dropped.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTwenty office staff reported to Rob Ford on May 16, 2013.

This Declaration arose out of ever-growing concerns regarding worldwide famine, and in doing so, stressed that every country that is in a position to be able to assist developing nations to gain access to more, better quality food, has the responsibility to ensure that this right to food is realized.\n\nThe prevalence of hunger and malnutrition is an issue that has long been of international concern. Although it has been accepted that obtaining exact statistics regarding world hunger is difficult, it is believed that in the early 1960s, there were approximately 900 million undernourished individuals worldwide. The majority of these individuals were located in developing nations such as Africa, Asia and Latin America. It is believed that today, one in every nine individuals do not have an adequate access to food. Hunger and malnutrition have now been identified as the cause of more deaths worldwide than AIDS, malaria and tuberculosis combined. Today it is estimated that there are approximately 1.02 billion people across the world living in conditions of extreme hunger, 1 billion of whom live in developing countries. Hunger and malnutrition have been of growing concern throughout the international community, despite a number of intervention attempts from the likes of States and non-government organisations. The right to food, for example, was asserted in the 1948 Universal Declaration of Human Rights(UDHR), and was again recognised in 1966 through Article 11 of the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights.\n\nLeading up to the drafting and formation of the Universal Declaration on the Eradication of Hunger and Malnutrition, the international community as a whole was becoming increasingly aware of the severity of the worldwide issue of hunger and malnutrition, and identified an immediate need for some form of action to combat this. This growing concern was an important factor leading to the first World Food Conference convening in Rome in 1974 in an attempt to uncover an adequate solution in order to combat this issue.\n\nRepresentatives from 135 countries attended the 1974 World Food Conference where this Declaration was adopted. As well as these State representatives, a number of libertarian movements, United Nations bodies and intergovernmental organisations were also present at this Conference. Representatives from the following countries were present for the formation of the Universal Declaration on the Eradication of Hunger and Malnutrition: \n\nThe Declaration in itself is 12 paragraphs. Many of these paragraphs have now been elaborated on in subsequent international human rights treaties and regional human rights instruments. Throughout these paragraphs, the intended purposes, functions and goals of this Declaration are set out. A number of these paragraphs are worth further consideration. \n\nThe Declaration itself identifies that the key purpose in its adoption was to develop more adequate means for the international community as a whole, to take action to resolve the world hunger problem. It was further outlined that this Declaration was adopted to encourage and further develop international economic co-operation. Ultimately, this Declaration sought to develop a series of ways that the international community in its entirety, could work towards combatting, and ultimately overcoming, the growing issue of hunger and malnutrition. This Declaration highlighted the urgency of attending to this matter and called for rapid and sustained action to bring an end to this menacing problem of world hunger. Another crucial reason underlying the adoption of this Declaration was the need to remind the world’s population that freedom from hunger, and the right to food, is an inalienable human right that needs to be protected. It also sought to remind the world that the access to adequate food is an essential factor in the full development of an individual’s physical and mental faculties.\n\nThe following resolutions were adopted to attempt to fulfil the purpose of this Declaration:\n\n\nIn 2014, the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations recognised that the Universal Declaration on the Eradication of Hunger and Malnutrition was one of the key non-binding human rights instruments in relation to the right to food. A non-binding international instrument such as this Declaration outlines the guidelines and principles, imposing moral, but not legal, obligations on party states. The United Nations, in its description of the purpose of a Declaration, stated that the intention here is not to create binding obligations to be enforced on states, but rather to declare certain aspirations. Although states whom are party to a Declaration of this kind are not legally bound, non-binding Declarations are well accepted to be crucial in the development of international human rights law.\n\nThis Declaration has been crucial in the growing knowledge, support and aid of food and agriculture to developing nations. Research has identified that the number of people across the world who are chronically malnourished has decreased by 167 million over the past decade. However, in 1996 the World Food Summit called for the need for a 50% reduction in the amount of malnourished people by the year 2015 – a goal that was not achieved. Because of this, a number of human rights advocates such as the United Nations and the World Food Summit have since been calling for further action in the attempt to end this crisis. These organisations now believe that the best way to bring an end to this crisis is through the implementation of enforceable international laws that guarantee the right for people to be free from hunger. Such organisations believe that the international community needs to create some enforceable legal document such as an International Food Security Treaty that ensures the right to food is recognised, and imposes obligations on countries to develop their own national law on the issue.\n\n"}

{"id": "33443344", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=33443344", "title": "Water management in Dhaka", "text": "Water management in Dhaka\n\nWater management in Dhaka, the capital of Bangladesh and a city with 20 million inhabitants, faces numerous challenges such as flooding, poor service quality, groundwater depletion, inadequate sanitation, polluted river water, unplanned urban development, and the existence of large slums where more than one third of its population lives. Residents of Dhaka enjoy one of the lowest water tariffs in the world, which limits the utility's capacity to invest. The utility in charge of water and sanitation in Dhaka, DWASA, addresses these challenges with a number of measures. It says that in 2011 it achieved a continuous water supply 24 hours per day 7 days a week, an increase in revenues so that operating costs are more than covered, and a reduction of water losses from 53% in 2003 to 29% in 2010. For these achievements DWASA, got a \"Performer of the Year Award\" at the Global Water Summit 2011 in Berlin. In the future DWASA plans massive investment to replace dwindling groundwater resources with treated surface water from less polluted rivers located up to 160 km from the city. In 2011 Bangladesh's capital development authority, Rajdhani Unnayan Kartripakkha, made rainwater harvesting for new houses mandatory in an effort to address water scarcity and reduce flooding.\n\nThe first piped drinking water system in Dhaka was established in 1874 by Khwaja Abdul Ghani, the aristocrat that ruled Dhaka under the British colonial authorities. The system was fed by a water treatment plant in Chadnighat near the bank of the river Buriganga. After independence from the British in 1948 the Department of Public Health Engineering of the Pakistani government was in charge of drinking water supply as well as sanitary sewers and storm-water drainage. Dhaka WASA (Water Supply & Sewerage Authority) was established in 1963. In 1989, the storm-water drainage system of Dhaka city was handed over to DWASA. In 1990, the service area was extended to include Narayanganj city. In the early 1990s the World Bank had said it would only provide a loan for water supply in Dhaka if the utility would enter into a public-private partnership with an international water company. When this was rejected, it asked that revenue billing and collection should be outsourced to a private company for at least one service area on a pilot basis, and that DWASA should be transformed into a commercially oriented utility. The outsourcing in one service area was done in 1997, but the pilot project was not deemed successful and was stopped. DWASA's activities have been reorganised by the Dhaka WASA Act, 1996 that transformed DWASA into a service-oriented commercial organisation.\n\nThe service area of DWASA covers more than 360 square km with a population of about 12 million. It extends from Mirpur and Uttara in the North to Narayanganj in the South. Buriganga river and many canals flow through the city. Tropical vegetation and moist soils characterise the land, which is flat. The elevation of Greater Dhaka is 2 to 13 meters above the mean sea level, and most of the urbanised areas are at elevation of 6 to 8 metres. This leaves Dhaka susceptible to flooding during the monsoon seasons owing to heavy rainfall and cyclones.\n\nWater management in Dhaka faces numerous challenges such as flooding, poor service quality, groundwater depletion, inadequate sanitation, polluted river water, unplanned urban development, and the existence of large slums where more than one third of its population lives. Every year during the dry season, people demonstrate in Dhaka's streets demanding an uninterrupted supply of clean water. In 2010, Bangladesh's government had to even deploy troops to guard water pumps following angry protests.\n\nBangladesh has been repeatedly exposed to severe flooding. Dhaka was particularly hit by the floods of 1970, 1974, 1980, 1987, 1988, 1996, 1998, 2004, 2007 and 2009, some of which such as the ones in 1988 and 1998 were catastrophic with flood levels of up to 4.5m in parts of the city. During the 1998 flood about 56 percent of the city was inundated, including most of the eastern and 23 percent of the western parts of the city. During non-catastrophic floods some streets are inundated for up to 60 cm for several days. Flooding in Dhaka is caused by high rainfall in the city and/or by flooding from the surrounding rivers and canals. The western and most densely settled part of Dhaka is protected from river flooding by raised roads and an encircling embankment built after the 1988 flood. The eastern part of the city where most of the expansion takes place consists of low-lying floodplains that are submerged during the monsoon season. When high rainfall coincides with a high water level in the river, stormwater cannot be naturally evacuated through the drainage system. Retention areas are supposed to mitigate flooding and pumping stations have been set up to evacuate floodwater. However, encroachment of natural runoff detention areas, lack of maintenance of storm sewers and pumps, and a lack of co-ordination among responsible organisations hamper efforts at flood management. Four organisations are in charge of various aspects of stormwater management in Dhaka: The Bangladesh Water Development Board (BWDB) is in charge of operating regulators and gates in the embankment; DWASA is in charge of the larger open drainage canals and pipes; Dhaka City Corporation (DCC) operates smaller underground and surface drains; and the Capital Development Authority (RAJUK) constructs underground roadside drainage lines during the construction of new roads. Stormwater pumping stations of various sizes are operated by BWDB, DWASA and the Dkaha City Corporation. After the catastrophic 1998 flood caused by high river levels, it turned out that there was neither an operating policy nor person assigned to operate an important regulator, the Rampura Regulator. Many gates that were supposed to be closed to keep the water from the rising rivers out had not been closed. Furthermore, in 2002 it was noted that the existing earthen embankment was unstable and cracking in large sections. Also, construction of embankments through low-lying areas without providing adequate drainage facilities had caused internal flooding.\n\nAccording to background information for a representative survey conducted for the Asian Development Bank in 2005, out of the 12 million inhabitants of Dhaka, the Dhaka water utility provided drinking water for 9 million through house connections, as well as for an additional 600,000 through 1700 standpipes and 100,000 through bulk connections. Bulk connections are located in slums and are known as \"Water Points\". NGOs are responsible for the installation, operation, maintenance as well as collection of revenues from these connections. Only 39% of the residential customers surveyed reported having a continuous water supply. On average, customers received water 15 hours per day. 75% of residential and 85% of non-residential customers reported that they had water storage facilities at their premises. 62% of residential customers reported their water quality as good or fair, i.e. not smelly or dirty. Only 10% of residential customers reported drinking water directly from the tap. By far the most common treatment method was boiling. 75% of the domestic and 64% of the non-domestic households were willing to pay more for better services.\n\nThe authors of the survey note a number of discrepancies between utility data and the results of the survey. The utility indicated at the time that 70% of its customers had continuous supply, that 63% had meters and that 97% of meters were in working condition. However, the survey indicated that 42% had continuous supply, that 76% were metered and that only 77% of meters were in working condition.\n\n82% of the city's water supply is abstracted from groundwater through 577 deep tube wells, while four relatively small surface water treatment plants provide the remaining 18%. Groundwater levels are dropping at two to three metres every year. The city's water table has sunk by 50 metres in the past four decades and the closest underground water is now over 60 meters below ground level. The Asian Development Bank estimated in 2007 that by 2015 a severe supply shortage would occur if the utility did not reduce groundwater abstraction. Nevertheless, DWASA announced in 2012 that it will develop a new wellfield with 46 wells providing 150,000 cubic meters of water per day at a cost of USD63 million, of which USD45 million will be financed by the government of South Korea.\n\nIn Dhaka, nearly one third of domestic effluents does not receive any kind of treatment. About 38% of the population is covered by a sewerage system. There is one wastewater treatment plant with a capacity of 120,000 m³ per day. About 30% of the population uses conventional septic tanks and another 15% uses bucket and pit latrines. During the rainy season, sewage overflows are common.\n\nResidents of Dhaka enjoy one of the lowest water tariffs in the world. The Executive Head of DWASA lists provision of water at low cost as one of the achievements of the utility. However, low revenues limit the utility's capacity to make a higher contribution to investments.\n\nAccording to DWASA's official website, in November 2011 the metered residential tariff was 6.6 Taka (US$0.09) per cubic meter. For households with sewer connections the tariff was 15.5 Taka (US$0.21) per cubic meter. Unmetered residential water connections were billed 128 Takas (US$1.72) per month. The commercial, industrial and institutional tariffs are more than three times higher. Total revenues were the equivalent of about US$70 million per annum in 2010 and, according to DWASA management, cover about 25% more than the operating costs of the utility (operating ratio of 0.79).\n\nHowever, a recent study shows that for domestic water use slum dwellers in Dhaka Metropolitan Area are paying about 7 to 14 times higher than the legal connection holders covered by DWASA. Slum dwellers are spending about 12 to 15% of their average monthly income for domestic water supply, whereas in most of the countries, legal connection holders are spending less than 5% of their average monthly income for the same purpose.\n\nA common indicator of whether water utilities are overstaffed is the ratio of employees per 1,000 connections. Using this indicator, DWASA appears to be overstaffed: According to DWASA, the utility had 3,566 employees and served 325,717 connections in 2013, resulting in 10.9 employees per 1,000 connections. This figure is 30% higher than the average of 18 major Asian cities, which was 8.3 in 2001 according to the Asian Development Bank. However, in Dhaka there are more than 40 inhabitants per connection, an unusually high ratio. Thus, for a city of 12 million the utility is not necessarily overstaffed. For example, the city of Berlin, Germany, also had 3,948 employees in 2009, but served less than 4 million people. Given low salaries in Bangladesh, it is also appropriate to use more labour-intensive approaches than in richer countries, and the staffing level should thus probably not be considered to be overly high.\n\nIn 2010 the Dhaka water utility, DWASA, embarked on a \"Turnaround Plan\" for the period 2010–12. The Turnaround Plan includes capacity building, more transparency and accountability, and better customer orientation. According to the Executive Head of DWASA, as of early 2011 achievements are a continuous water supply 24 hours per day 7 days a week, an increase in revenues so that operating costs are more than covered, and a reduction of water losses. For these achievements DWASA, got a \"Performer of the Year Award\" at the Global Water Summit 2011 in Berlin, an event organised by an industry magazine. The award selection was made by participants based on presentations by the managers of seven invited utilities from Algeria, Bangladesh, Brazil, Poland, Romania and the United States.\n\nIn Dhaka, the share of non-revenue water (NRW), water which is not billed, e.g., due to leakage and illegal connections, has been reduced substantially. According to DWASA, system losses have been reduced from 36% in 2007–08 to 27% in 2012–13. Their goal is to continue reducing system loss by two percent per year. The average level of NRW in 17 other major Asian cities, as estimated by the ADB in 2004, was 34%.\n\nDWASA introduced a computerised billing system including the ability of customers to pay bills via SMS. Through this system and other measures revenues increased by 20% in a year and a half from 2009 on, while tariffs went up by only about 5% in July 2010.\n\nDWASA has eleven revenue zones. It sets a zone-wide annual target for billing, collection and reduction of non-revenue water. In at least three revenue zones utility staff are in charge of billing and collection directly, while in the other revenue zones this is done by an employees' cooperative, the Employees' Consumers Supplies Cooperative Society Ltd. (ECSCSL), under contract with the utility. Most of the workers at ECSCSL are seconded from Dhaka WASA. They receive salaries that are up to three times higher than at Dhaka WASA. Non-performing employees can be sent back to Dhaka WASA and ECSCSL can recruit new employees on its own. Workers also undertake water connections in informal houses, which Dhaka WASA rules do not normally permit.\n\nThe system was introduced in 1997 in the context of privatisation efforts (see history section) which were opposed by employees. It was thus decided that one zone would be privatised and another one would be given to the employees' cooperative, experimentally, for one year. The private company and ECSCSL started in September 1997. In 1998 a monitoring committee found that ECSCSL had out-performed the private company in revenue collection increases and non-revenue water reductions. Subsequently, Dhaka WASA asked ECSCSL to take over two more of its revenue zones. The cooperative made sure that consumers receive bills monthly rather than bimonthly. The Cooperative has met its contractual targets every year. However, an independent study conducted in 2004 found that Dhaka WASA tends to choose deliberately low financial targets in the Cooperative zones. Moreover, the cost of revenue collection in the cooperative zones has almost doubled.\n\nA project provided water to hitherto unserved slum areas through community-based organisations with the assistance of the NGO Dushtha Shasthya Kendra (DSK) and WaterAid from the UK. Initially the utility refused to provide water connections, saying that slum dwellers would not be able or not be willing to pay water bills. DSK, which knew the community-based organisations in the slums well due to its previous work on health issues there, gave financial guarantees in case the community failed to pay. On that basis, the utility provided water points. The communities paid their bills on time, so that the guarantee never had to be called. From 2008 onwards, the utility provided water points to the slums without requiring a guarantee. \n\nA pilot project for a small-bore sewer system in the Mirpur area of Dhaka was implemented several years ago, with financing from the Asian Development Bank. This scheme was never commissioned and is now completely non-functional.\n\nThe utility plans to substitute surface water for groundwater through the construction of four large water treatment plants until 2020 at a cost of US$1.8bn (Saidabad Phase II and III, Padma/Pagla and Khilkhet). The treatment plants will draw water from more distant and less polluted rivers up to 160 km from the city. The four plants are expected to have a combined capacity of 1.63 million cubic meters per year, compared to a 2010 supply of 2.11 million cubic meter per year that is mainly from groundwater. As of 2011, funding had been secured for the first plant which is under construction thanks to a USD250 million contribution from Danish development assistance. In 2012 the government signed a contract with a Chinese company to build a water treatment plant at Munshiganj on the Padma River. The project costs USD407 million, of which USD290.8 million is financed by a soft loan from the Chinese government, the remainder coming from the Bangladeshi government.\n\nTo alleviate the water scarcity, in 2011 the city of Dhaka announced it would amend its building code to require rooftop rainwater harvesting systems in new buildings. The measure aims to address the city's worsening water shortages and curb drops in groundwater levels. Collecting rainwater also will help avoid flooding problems in Dhaka during the monsoon season.\n\nDWASA is under the authority of the Ministry of Local Government, Rural Development and Cooperatives. DWASA's Board consists of 13 members and is chaired by a customer representative. The Ministry is represented by a Joint Secretary from the Local Government Division. Two board members are appointed by the municipal authority and one by the Minister of Finance. The Executive Head of DWSASA is also an ex officio member of the Board. Other Board members are appointed by professional associations and the Chamber of Commerce and Industry.\n\n\n"}

He is also known as Han Zhongli () because he was said to have been born in the Han dynasty. In legend, he wields a large fan which can resurrect the dead and transform stones into silver or gold.\n\nZhongli was born in Yanjing. According to legend, bright beams of light filled the labour room during his birth. After he was born, he did not stop crying until seven full days had passed. He was destined for greatness from the day he was born by showing features such as a broad forehead, thick ears, long eyebrows, deep eyes, red nose, square mouth, high cheeks, and scarlet lips. Stories depict that either seven days or seven years later, he began to speak, and the first sentence he uttered was, “my feet have wandered in the purple palace of the [immortals], my name is recorded in the capital of the jade emperor.\" Later Taoists celebrate his birthday on the fifteenth day of the fourth month of the Chinese calendar. Following his father's example, he became a member of the court, advancing to be general of one of the armies of the Han dynasty. During his time as a general, his army fought against Tibet. In his last battle he was beaten by the Tibetans, forcing him to flee into the mountainous areas surrounding him. There he came across an old man who led him to a spiritual sanctuary where he was welcomed in and told that he could stay as long as was needed. There he learned the ways of the immortal rituals and extensive amounts of alchemy. After three hard days of teaching, he was dismissed and told to use his newfound powers to serve his people. When he turned back to talk to the man, he and his home had vanished. Using his power of alchemy and his magical fan, he created silver and gold coins from stones and saved people from poverty and famine.\n\nThere are two stories that depict how he became one of the immortals. In the first, it was in his continuous use of the immortal powers and his magical fan that eventually caused his descent into the shimmering cloud of the immortals. In the second, he was meditating near a wall of his hermitage when all of a sudden it collapsed. Behind the wall was a jade vessel that took him as an immortal to the shimmering cloud.\n\nIn Taoism, he is known as \"Zhengyang Zushi\" (), literally \"True-Yang Ancestor-Master\". He is also called \"Master of the Cloud-Chamber\" () in accounts describing his encounter with Lü Dongbin before achieving immortality.\n\nUsually depicted with his chest and belly bare and holding a fan made of feathers or horse hair, Zhongli is often set apart from the other immortals in pictures by wisps of hair on his temples and a beard down to his navel. He is known for his pleasing disposition, and is often painted or drawn drinking wine.\n\nIn the television show \"Jackie Chan Adventures\", Zhongli was shown to be the Immortal who sealed away Xiao Fung, The Wind Demon.\n"}
