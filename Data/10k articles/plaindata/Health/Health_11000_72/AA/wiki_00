The earliest reported cases in the US began appearing in late March 2009 in California, then spreading to infect people in Texas, New York, and other states by mid-April. Early cases were associated with recent travel to Mexico; many were students who had traveled to Mexico for Spring Break. This spread continued across the country's population and by the end of May there were approximately 0 confirmed cases throughout all 50 states.\n\nOn April 28, 2009, the director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) confirmed the first official US death of swine flu, a 23-month-old toddler from Mexico who died on April 27 while visiting Texas.\nBy June 24, 132 deaths had been attributed to the virus.\nAs of January 11, 2010, at least 13,837 deaths were attributed to the virus worldwide, and at least 2290 deaths in the US were confirmed to be due to the virus. The CDC suspects, however, that the total number of deaths in the US is much higher than the official total, as some deaths probably went unconfirmed.\n\nOn May 2, 2009, the Alabama Department of Public Health confirmed the first case of H1N1 (swine flu) in Madison, Alabama, one of two probable cases previously identified at an elementary school in Madison. As a result, all public schools and most private schools and daycare centers in Madison County, Alabama, including the cities of Huntsville and Madison, closed for two days. After meeting with the state public health officer on May 3, 2009, all Madison city elementary schools were to be closed through May 13, 2009, but were reopened after the CDC updated its guidance to schools.\n\nAs of December 5, 2009, the Alabama Department of Public Health reports 2453 confirmed and 36 deaths from swine flu. As of January 9, 2010, Alabama was the only US state reporting widespread A/H1N1 flu activity.\n\nOn May 10, 2009, the Alaska state Division of Public Health reported the state's first probable case of swine flu in a crew member of a Royal Caribbean cruise ship traveling in Alaska waters. On May 12, they confirmed that the woman had been infected with swine flu but they do not consider it to be Alaska's first case because she became ill before entering state waters.\n\nAs of December 5, 460 cases of swine flu and 11 deaths were confirmed in Alaska.\nOn July 27, Alaska health officials confirmed the first H1N1-related death.\n\nAs of October 31, the Arizona Department of Health Services had reported a total of 6,302 confirmed cases of H1N1 infection since April 2009, with at least one case reported in each of the state's 15 counties. 786 of the cases had resulted in hospitalization of the patient, and 81 deaths were associated with H1N1 infection in that period of time. Of the H1N1 associated deaths reported in the state, 72% suffered an underlying medical condition (asthma, lung or heart conditions, cancer, metabolic disorders, pregnancy, immunosuppressive disorders, neurologic diseases or other chronic diseases) at the time of death.\n\nOn April 28, the first cases of H1N1 influenza infection in Arizona were confirmed in four school-aged patients in the Phoenix metropolitan area. The schools attended by the patients were immediately closed following recommendations from the CDC; after only 3 days, however, local authorities reopened the schools, stating that the H1N1 flu appeared to be no more deadly than the seasonal flu. School closures in the area have since been eliminated in favor of simply sending the infected children home, resulting in slightly elevated absence rates statewide. The first death in the state due to H1N1 swine flu complications was reported by the Maricopa County Department of Public Health on May 14.\nAs of January 15, Arizona has reported 142 deaths due to confirmed A/H1N1 influenza, including at least 2 in 2010 alone.\n\nAs of July 16, 2009, the Arkansas Department of Health has reported 51 confirmed cases of swine flu. Four of the cases were from Camp Robinson, a US Army National Guard base located in North Little Rock in Pulaski County.\nDeaths by county:\n\n\nThe first two cases detected in the US were two children living in San Diego County and Imperial County (a county in which 18% of the residents are not US citizens),\nwho became ill on March 28 and 30 respectively. A CDC alert concerning these two isolated cases was reported in the media on April 21. As of April 24 eight human cases were known in the US, including six in Southern California. The patients have recovered. The acting director of the US Centers for Disease Control (CDC) said that preliminary tests on seven out of fourteen samples from patients in Mexico had matched the virus found in the US, which experts say is a new strain of swine flu. None of the US patients had any contact with pigs, leading CDC officials to believe that human-to-human transmission has been occurring.\n\nGov. Arnold Schwarzenegger and the state of California activated the Joint Emergency Operations Center of the Department of Public Health, and are coordinating with the California Emergency Management Agency, the CDC, and the Mexican government. They have additionally stepped up other preparations to lessen the flu's threat. On April 28, Gov. Schwarzenegger declared a state of emergency which allows the state to deploy additional resources to the Department of Public Health and more quickly and easily purchase equipment and materials.\n\nSt. Mels Catholic School in Fair Oaks was closed after Sacramento County Health Department notified the school that a 7th grade student who reportedly recently returned from a family vacation in Mexico tested positive for an unidentified strain of influenza virus A. On April 27, CDC officials confirmed that the student tested positive for swine flu. In Marin County, a grandmother and her 20-month-old granddaughter have been confirmed to have the flu. By April 28, the CDC had confirmed 10 cases of swine flu in California.\n\nCalifornia State University, Long Beach reported on April 29 that a student had returned a \"probable positive\" test result for swine influenza. The student showed symptoms on Sunday April 26 and went to the campus health services office the following day. The test results were received by the school on April 28 and distributed to all students and faculty. The affected student had not attended any classes since falling ill and has an apparently mild case of the disease that does not appear life-threatening. Three high schools in Riverside County were closed April 29 after two teenage girls, from Corona and Indio respectively, were confirmed to have contracted the virus. Branham High School in San Jose was closed that day for a week after one teenage girl was confirmed to be a probable case. Rucker Elementary School in Gilroy is set to be closed on Friday, May 1 after at least one student was being tested after exhibiting flu-like symptoms. Three students at the Grizzly Youth Academy in San Luis Obispo are confirmed cases of swine influenza. As many as 73 students are exhibiting flu-like symptoms at The Academy and are assumed to have the virus. All are being isolated. The Academy is set to stay open. On May 3, 2009, parent of students attending King Middle School in Berkeley were notified that their school would be closed down due to a swine flu outbreak involving students at the school. Days later, other schools were closed down because of students or staff exhibiting flu-like symptoms; for example, Sunnyside Elementary School and Woodville Elementary School, both in Tulare County.\n\nOn June 1, 2009, the first two deaths were confirmed, one by a middle-aged man in San Bernardino County, and another one by a middle-aged woman in Los Angeles County. A third death was confirmed on June 4, when a nine-year-old girl from Contra Costa County died. They were followed by an Orange County man's death on June 8 and a middle-aged man's death in Alameda County on June 9. As of June 9, there were 973 confirmed cases, 266 probable cases, and five deaths caused by the H1N1 flu. On June 10, another middle-aged man died in Alameda County, thus making it the third death in the San Francisco Bay Area.\n\nOn July 1, a woman who had been hospitalized in Marin County died of swine flu.\n\nAs of July 23, 2009, 2,655 cases and 61 deaths in California had been confirmed.\n\nA list of hospitalizations and deaths can be viewed at the California Department of Health Website.\n\nAs of mid-September 2009, California had 2,655 cases and 152 deaths.\nAs of January 15, at least 479 California residents had died from confirmed H1N1 infection.\n\nOn April 30 two cases of the flu virus were confirmed in the state of Colorado. The confirmed cases were a woman from Arapahoe County who recently returned from a cruise to Mexico and a Denver International Airport baggage handler. Two more H1N1 influenza cases were confirmed on May 2, both in Jefferson County, Colorado. One case is a middle school student, which has caused the school he attends to close for a week. The tally increased to seven on May 4 when The University of Colorado at Boulder (CU) confirmed three of its students contracted the virus.\n\nThere were 171 cases reported in Colorado as of July 18.\nOn July 29, 2009 Colorado reported its first A(H1N1) swine flu death in El Paso County of a woman in her forties.\n\nOn April 28, it was announced that there were suspected cases of swine flu in three Connecticut towns. Schools were closed due to suspected cases in East Haddam and Wethersfield, though tests on these patients later came back negative. On April 30, two students at Fairfield University were announced as having \"probable\" swine flu, in addition to another person in Glastonbury, bringing the total number of likely cases to 6. On May 1, the first confirmed case of swine flu was reported in Connecticut in Stratford. On May 2, the second confirmed case was reported in a child from Middlefield that had recently returned from a family trip to Mexico. On May 5, Fairfield University announced that two \"probable\" cases had tested positive for the H1N1 flu, with five other \"probable\" cases awaiting test results. One May 8, Fairfield announced that those five students had also tested positive, although the students by that time were nearly recovered, and there remained one \"probable\" case remained to be confirmed.\nOn Wednesday, June 3, The first death confirmed to be linked to the H1N1 virus happened in New Haven County. As of Wednesday, June 17 there are 7 confirmed cases of the H1N1 virus at Joseph A. Foran High School of Milford. The school is following a half day schedule until the end of the year, which was reported as being successful for preventing the virus.\n\nBy July 22, 2009, there were 1,713 confirmed cases of swine flu in Connecticut. New Haven has the most of any town with 175 cases.\nIn January 2010, the Connecticut CDC stated that there were 1,996 confirmed cases of A/H1N1 influenza in the first wave of the A/H1N1 influenza pandemic, and 3,386 confirmed cases of A/H1N1 influenza in the second wave of the A/H1N1 pandemic. 31 deaths from A/H1N1 were confirmed over the course of the pandemic.\n\nThe first probable cases of swine flu in Delaware were reported on Monday, April 27. Four probable cases of swine flu were reported on the University of Delaware campus after the students were experiencing flu like symptoms. Tests were sent to the CDC to see if the students had the swine flu. All four cases were confirmed by the CDC on April 28.

The department website has since not updated its case counts.\n\n\nOn April 28, it was reported that an individual in Florida had tested positive for influenza type A, of which swine flu is a subtype. A culture from that person has been sent to Jacksonville to be tested for swine flu, with results expected within 48 hours. Governor Crist announced the first two confirmed cases in Florida on May 1. The cases are both children and in Lee and Broward counties.\n\nOn May 3, the Hillsborough County Health Department announced 5 possible cases of H1N1, 4 of the persons are students, and the other is a relative who has recently traveled to Mexico. Three public schools (Wilson Middle School, Freedom High School, and Liberty Middle School) where the students attended have been closed till May 11.\n\nOn May 7, Alachua County announced its first case of H1N1 (Swine Flu). The person is a University of Florida student and has since recovered. On May 8, a 7-year-old boy tested positive of swine influenza in Rockledge, Brevard County, Florida .

A Kentucky woman was hospitalized in LaGrange while visiting family in Georgia; she had recently returned from a trip to Mexico. While Georgia health officials reported this as a confirmed case for the state, the CDC and the Kentucky health department reported it as a case in Kentucky. In relation to this case, state officials said they had no plans to close schools or other public institutions.\n\nOn May 4, the Georgia Department of Human Resources announced that all classes have been temporarily suspended at Eagle's Landing Christian Academy in Henry County until the CDC confirms the status of a student who became ill. The Georgia Public Health Laboratory sent three probable cases to the CDC over the weekend for confirmation.

Furthermore, the vaccine became readily available to the general public under 65.\n\nBy December 30, 2009 the state had 824 laboratory-confirmed cases since September 1, and the virus had contributed to the deaths of 20 people.\n\nBy January 23, 2010 despite at least 23 Idaho deaths and 385 hospitalizations and the widespread availability\nof the H1N1 vaccine, only 10% to 15% of the populace of Ada County had been inoculated, prompting concern amongst public health officials.\n\nThe state's first probable case of swine flu was reported on Wednesday, April 29. An elementary school in Chicago's Rogers Park neighborhood, on the city's Far North Side, was closed because a 12-year-old student was presumed to have the disease. The student reportedly was recovering at home. By April 30, over 40 probable cases had been identified by state and local health officials. In addition to 16 cases in the city of Chicago, and 11 in surrounding Cook County, cases were reported in Kane, Lake, DuPage, McHenry, and Will counties. Several schools in the affected areas were temporarily closed. Many other flu cases happened during or even before the launch of the alert were then confirmed, principally in the urban area of Chicago. By May 20, the following 17 counties had confirmed cases: Boone, Cook, DeKalb, DuPage, Franklin, Kane, Kankakee, Kendall, Knox, Lake, McDonough, McHenry, Ogle, Sangamon, Will, Williamson, and Winnebago.

A third confirmed death – the first outside of the Chicago metropolitan area – was reported by state health authorities on May 28, 2009 but this was not reflected in the CDC official numbers by the end of the month.\n\nA total of 3,366 cases and 17 deaths have been confirmed in Illinois as of July 24.\nAs of January 2010, a total of 2931 hospitalizations due to confirmed A/H1N1 infection and a total of 97 confirmed deaths due to H1N1 have been reported in Illinois.\n\nOn April 28, an unidentified Notre Dame student was confirmed as the first case of swine flu in this state. The patient had not recently traveled to Mexico or been in contact with anyone who has traveled to Mexico. The student was in voluntarily quarantine, and was doing well, according to Judy Monroe, Indiana's state health commissioner. Two other cases in the state which occurred in two Indianapolis elementary schools were confirmed by the CDC shortly thereafter. Additional cases later surfaced in the counties of Hendricks, Lake, Marion, Putnam, St. Joseph, and Tippecanoe. On July 10, 2009, a young teenager died of Swine Flu, this was the first death in Indiana because of this disease.\n\nAs of July 24, the CDC has reported 291 cases of swine flu.\nAs of February 2010, there have been at least 38 confirmed deaths due to A/H1N1 infection. Also, since September 1, there have been at least 468 confirmed cases of H1N1 in Indiana.\n\nOn April 29, two probable case of swine flu were reported in Des Moines County and Clinton County. One was a woman from California, the other one was a man from Mexico. On May 3, another case was found in Marshall County causing schools to close. On the week of February 28, 2009, a three-year-old caught the swine flu due to close contact with ill pigs, but not the same dangerous strain that came from Mexico. In early May, cases climbed up to 43. A few were in Polk County, where Des Moines is.\n\nAs of July 24, 165 cases have been reported by the CDC.\n\nIn Iowa City's Iowa City High School, there were over 400 students absent on Oct. 7 with suspected H1N1. The recent homecoming dance is credited with causing this. The school's 9-day absence limit is also believed to have influenced this, restricting sick students from going home if they have already been absent 9 days. The school has refused to close despite protests from parents, teachers and students alike. On October 9, 32% of all students were absent out of over 1,600. The school has continued to stay open despite advisement by the Johnson County Health Department even as more and more of the student population falls ill. There are serious concerns of students passing along the virus to the community, creating a large local outbreak. As of October 15 the school is still open.\n\nHealth officials in Kansas announced April 25 that two new cases of swine flu had been confirmed in Dickinson County, after both were isolated. The week prior, one patient had traveled to Mexico by plane to attend a professional conference; both he and his wife experienced minor influenza symptoms.\n\nAs of July 24, 2009 there were 213 confirmed cases of swine flu in Kansas, 101 in adults and 112 in children. However, in Wyandotte and Johnson counties the state had instructed that only hospitalized patients needed to be tested so the numbers were quite possibly higher. By June 30, 2009 there were 129 confirmed swine flu cases in Kansas.\nAs of January 9,26 people have died of infection with H1N1, including a healthy 52-year-old man with no underlying health problems that would place him at higher risk for A/H1N1 infection.also, a 6-year-old Kansas boy and 27-year-old Kansas woman, have also died from infection with H1N1, reinforcing the fact that young, healthy people can die from infection with A/H1N1, and that vaccination is recommended even for those without preexisting medical problems.\n\nA Warren County woman who had recently visited Mexico tested positive for the virus April 30. After returning to Kentucky from Mexico, she traveled to Georgia where she was hospitalized. Health officials from both states announced this as the first confirmed case in their states, however the CDC listed the case in Kentucky.\n\nIn Jefferson County, Meyzeek Middle school has three cases of H1N1 influenza. This initially started from a staff member, but spread to students.\n\nAs of July 21, there are a total of 232 swine flu cases confirmed by The Louisiana Department of Health and Hospitals. Up from 114 reported on May 28. As of January 2010, 1,973 confirmed cases of H1N1 have been reported, and 43 H1N1 deaths have been confirmed, in Louisiana.\n\nOn April 29, three cases of H1N1 (swine flu) were confirmed in Maine, according to the Maine Center for Disease Control. The three adults, two from Kennebec County and one from York County, were reported to be recovering at home. Dr. Dora Anne Mills, former director of Maine CDC, said on April 28 that at least 12 suspected cases were being tested.\n\nLate on April 29, Maine Governor John Baldacci declared a \"civil emergency\" and ordered a school and daycare facility in York County to close for seven days.\n\nAs of July 22, there have been 282 cases confirmed throughout Maine. As of November 26, 1562 confirmed cases, 97 hospitalized cases, and 9 deaths have been reported in Maine. Also, 172 schools have reported outbreaks of H1N1 since May, according to Dr. Dora Anne Mills and the Maine CDC. On December 2, 2009, it was announced that H1N1 has killed 2 more Mainers, bringing the death toll to 11. As of December 17, 2009, the Maine CDC states that although 203 Mainers have now been hospitalized and the death toll has risen to 17 in Maine, H1N1 flu activity is decreasing in Maine, and vaccine availability is increasing rapidly, so all Mainers can now get the vaccine. Dr. Dora Anne Mills reminded Mainers that 150 Mainers die every year from regular influenza. As of December 24, 2009, Maine was one of the only 7 states reporting widespread influenza activity, though Maine's influenza activity was declining as well. As of January 7, 2010, H1N1 activity has decreased from widespread to regional for the first time since October 17, 2009. Although H1N1 activity in Maine has declined for the time being, H1N1 continues to circulate in Maine. H1N1 could return later this year, so it is still very important to get vaccinated against A/H1N1 influenza, Dr. Dora Anne Mills says. So far, 18 deaths, 225 hospitalizations, and 2220 cases have been confirmed.\n\nAs of January 14, the CDC states just 3 more patients required hospital care due to H1N1 disease, no new deaths occurred, and only 6 new cases were confirmed. However, one outbreak in a long term care facility was confirmed. As of January 28, H1N1 activity has decreased significantly, with the CDC classifying current influenza activity as sporadic. No new cases of A/H1N1 influenza were confirmed between January 21 and January 28.\n\nHowever, as of February 4, the Maine CDC reports that influenza activity has increased enough for the state to be again classified as having regional influenza activity, and that one person had died of confirmed A/H1N1 infection over the previous week, bringing the number of confirmed deaths from A/H1N1 to 19 in the state.\n\nBy May 1, 2009, eleven probable cases had been identified in Maryland, in Anne Arundel, Baltimore, Charles, Prince George's, and Montgomery Counties. One of these cases, that of a high school student in Rockville, resulted in the closing of Rockville High School, the first Maryland school closing due to the outbreak. On May 1, three other schools in the state were closed. As of May 5, Rockville High School has reopened. Takoma Park Middle School also began to take action due to a student catching swine flu. Four of Maryland's probable cases were confirmed on May 4, including two adults and one child in Baltimore County as well as one young child in Anne Arundel county. There are 4 cases of swine flu in Worcester County Public Schools in Maryland. In Washington County in Northeast Maryland there were many cases of the Swine Flu almost causing the closing of four Schools.\n\nAs of Fall 2009, there have been 954 confirmed cases in Maryland.\n\nIn late September 2009 a 13-year-old Baltimore resident became the first minor to die from swine flu in Maryland. As of December 2, oseltamivir-resistant H1N1 was confirmed in Maryland.

The first death from swine flu in Massachusetts occurred on June 14, 2009 when a 30-year-old Boston woman died. Eleven deaths have been confirmed as being caused by the H1N1 virus in total.\n\n\nOn April 29, a 34-year-old woman from Livingston County was Michigan's first reported case of swine flu. On April 30, another 34-year-old woman from Ottawa County was confirmed as Michigan's second case. As of June 13, Michigan reports 655 confirmed flu cases, and as of July 23, nine deaths. The health department has since stopped reporting cases but continues to update deaths.\n\nThe first death in Michigan was of a 53-year-old woman who lived in Warren and had other under-lying health problems. The second Michigan death occurred in Roscommon County.\n\nAs of August 10, 2009, ten deaths have been reported in Michigan due to the H1N1 virus. Michigan has stopped keeping a running tally of confirmed cases.\n\nOn October 28, 2009 157 schools in Michigan were closed due to the swine flu.\n\nOn April 30, 2009, the Minnesota Department of Health announced that the first case of \"H1N1 novel influenza virus\" in the state was confirmed by the CDC. The infected individual is an unidentified resident of Cold Spring, Minnesota. Two schools in the affected city will remain closed until May 6, 2009.\n\nOn May 4, 2009 the second case of H1N1 was confirmed in Minnesota by the Minnesota Department of Health. The case was reported in a teen boy attending a Minneapolis Public School.\n\nA Minneapolis five-year-old girl had succumbed to the flu during the week of June 8.\n\nAs of July 23, 684 cases and three deaths have been reported.\nAs of January 13,2 more people died of confirmed A/H1N1 influenza, increasing the number of confirmed deathsfrom H1N1 to 55 in the state.However, H1N1 influenza activity is currently low in Minnesota, with only one school outbreak reported in the first week of 2010.\n\nIn Missouri, Gov. Jay Nixon announced in a written statement that a probable case had been discovered in a Platte County man, and that a sample had been sent to the CDC for confirmation.\n\nAs of May 8, 2009, the Missouri Department of Health and Senior Services (DHSS) reported 10 confirmed and 4 probable cases of swine flu.\n\nOn May 19, 2009, a St. Louis County man became the first death in Missouri due to the Swine Flu.\n\nOn May 21, 2009, St. Louis Public School District announced one of its students had the Swine Flu but has not been in class since May 15.\n\nIn St. Charles Missouri it was also found that a student from St. Charles High School who traveled to Mexico City was found infected with swine flu. The student who just came back from Mexico City was in school for a week than kicked out and brought back.\n\nOn June 11, 2009, a teenager from New Bloomfield (11 miles north of the Jefferson City) in Callaway County became the 50th confirmed case of H1N1 in Missouri.\n\nOn June 20, 2009, about 20 to 30 campers at a Lake of the Ozarks summer camp in Morgan County reported having mild flu-like symptoms, of which two cases were confirmed to be H1N1. The camp was closed down for a week.\n\nAnother summer camp in Stone County near Branson reported at least 15 campers who have tested positive for the flu in preliminary tests on June 24. The preliminary results were possibly sent to a lab in neighboring Taney County as local reporters attempted to dispute or deny that \"any\" flu cases were reported in Taney County by going as far as to cite that the Taney County Health Department found zero cases of the flu. Official results from the DHSS confirm the camp had five campers with H1N1, but that all the campers were from out of state.\n\nReports from Adair, Buchanan, and Jefferson County were added on June 25 to DHSS's list of confirmed cases, bringing the count to 58 cases. These reports may be based on where people with H1N1 are from rather than where it was located in relation to the H1N1 cases reported at summer camps.\n\nThe youngest case of H1N1 was confirmed by DHSS in Cole County on June 25, 2009.

{"id": "1690106", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1690106", "title": "Alcohol flush reaction", "text": "Alcohol flush reaction\n\nAlcohol flush reaction is a condition in which a person develops flushes or blotches associated with erythema on the face, neck, shoulders, and in some cases, the entire body after consuming alcoholic beverages. The reaction is the result of an accumulation of acetaldehyde, a metabolic byproduct of the catabolic metabolism of alcohol, and is caused by an acetaldehyde dehydrogenase deficiency.\n\nThis syndrome has been associated with an increased risk of esophageal cancer in those who drink. It has also been associated with lower than average rates of alcoholism, possibly due to its association with adverse effects after drinking alcohol.\n\nApproximately 36% of East Asians (Chinese, Japanese, and Koreans) show characteristic physiological responses to drinking alcohol that includes facial flushing, nausea, headaches and a fast heart rate.\n\nIndividuals who experience the alcohol flushing reaction may be less prone to alcoholism. Disulfiram, a drug sometimes given as treatment for alcoholism, works by inhibiting acetaldehyde dehydrogenase, causing a five to tenfold increase in the concentration of acetaldehyde in the body. The resulting irritating flushing reaction tends to discourage affected individuals from drinking.\n\nFor measuring the level of flush reaction to alcohol, the most accurate method is to determine the level of acetaldehyde in the blood stream. This can be measured through both a breathalyzer test or a blood test. Additionally, measuring the amount of alcohol metabolizing enzymes alcohol dehydrogenases and aldehyde dehydrogenase through genetic testing can predict the amount of reaction that one would have. More crude measurements can be made through measuring the amount of redness in the face of an individual after consuming alcohol. Computer and phone applications can be used to standardize this measurement.\n\nOther effects include \"nausea, headache and general physical discomfort\".\n\nMany cases of alcohol-induced respiratory reactions, which involve rhinitis and worsening of asthma, develop within 1–60 minutes of drinking alcohol and are due to the same causes as flush reactions.\n\nAround 80% of East Asians (less common in Southeast Asia and the Indian subcontinent) have a variant of the gene coding for the enzyme alcohol dehydrogenase called \"ADH1B\", whereas almost all Chinese, Japanese, and Korean people have a variant of the gene called \"ADH1C\", both resulting in an alcohol dehydrogenase enzyme that converts alcohol to toxic acetaldehyde at a much higher efficiency than other gene variants (40- to 100-fold in case of ADH1B).\n\nIn about 50% of East Asians, the increased acetaldehyde accumulation is worsened by another gene variant, the mitochondrial ALDH2 allele, which results in a less functional acetaldehyde dehydrogenase enzyme, responsible for the breakdown of acetaldehyde. The result is that affected people may be better at metabolizing alcohol, often not feeling the alcohol \"buzz\" to the same extent as others, but show far more acetaldehyde-based side effects while drinking alcohol.\n\nAlcohol flush reaction is best known as a condition that is experienced by people of East Asian descent. According to the analysis by HapMap project, the rs671 allele of the \"ALDH2\" responsible for the flush reaction is rare among Europeans and Sub-Saharan Africans. 30% to 50% of people of Chinese, Japanese, and Korean ancestry have at least one \"ALDH2\" allele. The rs671 form of ALDH2, which accounts for most incidents of alcohol flush reaction worldwide, is native to East Asia and most common in southeastern China. It most likely originated among Han Chinese in central China, Another analysis correlates the rise and spread of rice cultivation in Southern China with the spread of the allele. The reasons for this positive selection aren't known, but it's been hypothesized that elevated concentrations of acetaldehyde may have conferred protection against certain parasitic infections, such as \"Entamoeba histolytica\".\n\nThose with facial flushing due to ALDH2 deficiency may be homozygotes, with two alleles of low activity, or heterozygotes, with one low-activity and one normal allele. Homozygotes for the trait find consumption of large amounts of alcohol to be so unpleasant that they are generally protected from esophageal cancer, but heterozygotes are able to continue drinking. However, an ALDH2-deficient drinker who drinks two beers per day has six to ten times the risk of developing esophageal cancer as a drinker not deficient in the enzyme.\n\nThe idea that acetaldehyde is the cause of the flush is also shown by the clinical use of disulfiram (Antabuse), which blocks the removal of acetaldehyde from the body via ALDH inhibition. The high acetaldehyde concentrations described share similarity to symptoms of the flush (flushing of the skin, accelerated heart rate, shortness of breath, throbbing headache, mental confusion and blurred vision).\n\nSince the mutation is a genetic issue, there is currently no cure for the flush reaction. Clinicians and the East Asian public generally know about the alcohol flushing response. Prevention would include not drinking alcohol.\n\n"}

The practice has a large Bengali population. It is a very deprived neighbourhood. He saw opening records to patients as a way of rebuilding trust in a difficult situation. He told the BBC: \"The week before I started there was a sit-down protest in the waiting room, because the patients were not happy about this doctor that was being foisted on them. That gives you some idea of the battlefield I was walking into.\" 150 patients at the practice were given access to their medical records and test results over the internet in 2007. Prof Steve Field of the Care Quality Commission recounted: “It was very difficult to recruit to Shipman’s practice because of [the lack of] trust locally. But Amir said, ‘Right from the start I will share everything with my patients, and gave them access to all their own records. He’s got examples of patients being admitted to hospital where they have had to show the consultants their record which may have saved their lives. It’s policy to try and make it happen. But it’s not moving quickly enough.” , 34% of the patient population were accessing to their GP record. There was no difference between the proportion of Bengali patients doing so and the rest of the practice population.\n\nHe was one of the first GPs pioneering Patient record access using EMIS software. He says \"there are some doctors and nurses who have genuine concerns about patients suddenly being let loose to access their records without any controls in place or without clinicians having to do anything and a feeling of irresponsibility that that raises.\" Jacqui Gladwin, a nursing lecturer who is one of his patients, was worried about online access. She asked:\"What happens if patients see information that is incorrect? How safe is the system? What happens if they see something distressing when the surgery is closed?\" She was surprised to find that other patients in the practice did not share her worries. At a meeting at the practice to discuss the development of records access, several patients had found errors in their records. They were positive about being able to identify errors and the response they had received when they reported them. They felt trusted to own the information, and secure when travelling abroad that they could allow other health professionals to access their medical information.\n\nHe speaks regularly about the benefits of giving patients access to their full GP electronic health records, and about how this works at his practice. And in 2008 he authored the Patient Access to Medical Records pattern of the Liberating Voices pattern language.\n\nResearch in which Hannan participated showed that practices who give at least a third of their patients full online access to their records could experience a decrease in appointment demand of up to 12%. Dr Brian Fisher, one of the other participants in the study conceded that as the practices concerned were leaders in their field with regard to offering online access to medical records, it could be difficult to extrapolate the results.\n\nHe has defended the government's Summary Care Record project, which has been criticised by other GPs on the grounds of cost. Each time an SCR was accessed for a patient in 2012 it cost £1,200. He says \"The SCR isn’t a panacea, it’s just one solution\". He was, however, critical of the care.data fiasco, saying \"If patients felt that their data was leaking out, and I had not warned them about it, then that would destroy my relationship with them.\"\n\nHe was ranked in the Health Service Journal's list of Clinical Leaders in 2015.\n\n"}

First known as the Alabama State Hospital for the Insane and later as the Alabama Insane Hospital, the building is considered an architectural model. The hospital currently houses 268 beds for acute care, treatment and rehabilitation of full-time (committed) patients. The Mary Starke Harper Geriatric Psychiatry Hospital, a separate facility on the same campus, provides an additional 100 beds for inpatient geriatric care. The main facility was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1977.\n\nThe plans for a state hospital for the mentally ill in Alabama began in 1852. The new facility was planned from the start to utilize the \"moral architecture\" concepts of 1830s activists Thomas Story Kirkbride and Dorothea Dix. Dix's reformist ideas, in particular, are credited as the driving force behind the construction of the hospital. Architect Samuel Sloan designed the Italianate building using the Kirkbride Plan. Construction of the building began in 1853 but was not completed until 1859. The hospital was the first building in Tuscaloosa with gas lighting and central heat, \"all clad in a fashionable Italianate exterior.\"\n\nThe Alabama Insane Hospital opened in 1861. It was later renamed for its first superintendent, Peter Bryce, who had first begun as a 27-year-old psychiatric pioneer from South Carolina. Bryce had been brought to the attention of the hospital trustees by Dix. He had studied mental-health care in Europe and worked in psychiatric hospitals in New Jersey, as well as his native state of South Carolina. His tenure was marked by absolute discipline among the staff of the hospital. He demanded that patients be given courtesy, kindness and respect at all times. The use of shackles, straitjackets and other restraints was discouraged, and finally abandoned altogether in 1882. Various work programs and other activities were encouraged, including farming, sewing, maintenance and crafts. Between 1872 and the early 1880s, some of the patients wrote and edited their own newspaper, called \"The Meteor\". These writings provide a rare inside look at life in a progressive mental institution in the late 19th century. At that time, Bryce's management and commitment to \"scientific treatments\" was recognized around the country as being in a class of its own.\n\nDuring the 20th century, the patient population expanded while standards of care fell to abysmal levels. Alabama Governor Lurleen Wallace viewed the facility in February 1967, and was moved to tears after an overweight, mentally challenged nine-year-old attempted to hug her, crying, \"Mama! Mama!\" She lobbied her husband, George Wallace (who held the actual power of her governorship) for more funds for the institution.\n\nIn 1970, Alabama ranked last among U.S. states in funding for mental health. Bryce Hospital at that time had 5,200 patients living in conditions that a \"Montgomery Advertiser\" editor likened to a concentration camp. That same year, a cigarette tax earmarked for mental-health treatment was cut. One hundred Bryce employees were laid off, including twenty professional staff. Members of the Department of Psychology at the University of Alabama attempted to file suit on behalf of the laid-off workers, but Federal Judge Frank M. Johnson ruled that the courts had no standing to intervene on behalf of fired employees. He left open, however, the possibility of a suit filed on behalf of patients, whose quality of care was affected.\n\nIn October 1970, Ricky Wyatt, a fifteen-year-old who had always been labeled a \"juvenile delinquent\" and housed at Bryce despite not being indicated with a mental illness, became the named plaintiff in a class-action lawsuit. His aunt, W. C. Rawlins, was one of the employees who had been laid off. Together they testified about intolerable conditions and improper treatments designed only to make the patients more manageable. In 1971 the plaintiff class was expanded to include patients at Alabama's two other inpatient mental health facilities, Searcy Hospital (Mt. Vernon) and Camp Partlow (Coker). The resulting court-ordered agreements formed the basis for federal minimum standards for the care of people with mental illness or mental retardations who reside in institutional settings. In 1999 a new settlement agreement was made, recognizing a great deal of progress. The case was finally dismissed on December 5, 2003, with the finding by Judge Myron Thompson that Alabama was in compliance with the agreement.\n\nThe standards elaborated in that agreement have served as a model nationwide. Known as the \"Wyatt Standards,\" they are founded on four criteria for evaluation of care:\n\nThe case of \"Wyatt v. Stickney\" came to a conclusion after 33 years, through the tenure of nine Alabama governors and fourteen state mental health commissioners, the longest mental health case in national history. The State of Alabama estimates its litigation expenses at over $15 million.\n\nGov. Bob Riley announced on December 30, 2009 that Bryce Hospital was to relocate into a newly constructed facility across McFarland Boulevard in Tuscaloosa, and the University of Alabama would take over the current Bryce campus. For several years the university had sought the parcel of land, which is adjacent to its landlocked campus.\n\nRiley said that a hospital for about 268 patients had been envisioned but the final size was yet to be determined. The deal, approved by Gov. Bob Riley and the Alabama Department of Mental Health on December 30, 2009 was worth $72 million in cash for Mental Health to build a replacement hospital. The university will pay $50 million in cash and Mental Health will get another $22 million in state bond money. The university pledged another $10 million to clean up environmental problems on the Bryce grounds and restore the main hospital building, construction of which started in 1853.\n\nThe sale of Bryce Hospital and Harper Center to UA was finalized on May 27, 2010 at a price of $87.75 million. $77 million would go to installments plus the aforementioned $10 million for ground improvements. \nIn 2014, the remaining patients were moved to a new facility and UA began a restoration project estimated at $40 million. Dan Wolfe, University of Alabama planner, revealed the two buildings will house a welcome center, \ntwo museums focusing on mental health and the history of the university, event space and classrooms for performing arts students. The project is expected to be complete by 2020.\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "20196951", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=20196951", "title": "Chapultepec aqueduct", "text": "Chapultepec aqueduct\n\nThe Chapultepec aqueduct (in Spanish: acueducto de Chapultepec) was built to provide potable water to Tenochtitlan, now known as Mexico City. This fresh water was transported from the Chapultepec springs. Two aqueducts following the same route from the springs were built by the Aztecs during the 15th century, the first destroyed by flooding and the second by the Spanish. After the Spanish conquest a colonial aqueduct was built, the remains of which are located near Metro Sevilla.\n\nThe water level under Tenochtitlan was only 4–5 feet below the city, however, it was not a viable source of freshwater as the water retrieved was brackish. Shallow wells were constructed, and the water retrieved was used for household work. Construction of an aqueduct that brought fresh water, suitable for cooking and drinking, from Chapultepec springs to Tenochtitlan began in 1418. Building relied on mud and plant material to create the foundation, which rested on artificial islands that were spread 3 to 4 meters apart. Mounds consisting of mud were constructed on these islands and driven through with a wooden stake for support. The top of each mound had a hollowed out trough lined with compacted clay, and hollowed out logs were placed in the bottom of the flow path to bridge gaps between the islands. A wooden plank walkway flanked the aqueduct, making it easily accessible and a method of transportation from the city to the outlying areas. Once the water reached the city, it was delivered to small reservoirs and select households through a network of canals that extended in the four cardinal directions and branched off to individual streets.\n\nDespite its relative longevity, the composition of the aqueduct could not withstand the forces of nature. Erosion weathered away the compacted clay, and in 1449, heavy rains triggered a flood that destroyed the aqueduct and effectively shut down Tenochtitlan for weeks.\n\nAfter the destruction of the original aqueduct, the engineer, Nezahualcoyotl, lead the construction of another water system using sturdier materials following the same route as the original. This aqueduct consisted of two mortar lined troughs made of stone masonry. The addition of the second trough allowed for water to be diverted to the second pipe when maintenance had to be performed on the other. This allowed for a continuous supply of fresh water to be delivered to the city. Like the original aqueduct, the second rested on a chain of artificial islands. The pipes were secured to the islands by wood pilings attached to a foundation of sand, lime, and rock. The aqueduct was constructed using wood, carved stone, and compacted soil, with portions made of hollowed logs, allowing canoes to travel underneath.\n\nAfter his arrival in the Aztec empire, Hernan Cortes discovered the economic and political importance of the Chapultepec aqueduct. He took advantage of the city's dependence on the aqueduct and blocked the fresh water supply, eventually destroying it. Shortly after the Spanish conquest, he set about dividing the land among the conquistadors. He wanted to take the forest of Chapultepec for himself, but Charles V, King of Spain, denied his request and decreed that the springs were needed to provide the people with potable water and were thereby the property of the city of Tenochtitlan. Construction of a new aqueduct started under the reigning Viceroy Fernando de Alencastre, 1st Duke of Linares (1711-1716). The structure became known under another name as the Aqueduct of Belen, named after an old Belen convent it passed by. Built along the same path as the Aztec engineered aqueducts, it was constructed using Roman architecture, reflected in its 904 arches. In completion, it reached a total length of 4663 varas, roughly 4 kilometers. In conquest times, the aqueduct supplied the city with the majority of its freshwater, however, waterborne illness was a concern. In an effort to reduce the possibility of external contamination, iron and lead pipes were installed to replace the open troughs during the 19th Century. These shielded the water from air and outside contaminants but did not decrease the number of pathogen related illnesses and death.\n\nLocated on Chapultepec Avenue near Metro Sevilla, a small section, about twenty-two arches long, still survives today. Also standing today are two fountains associated with the aqueduct. The first is found wedged between Chapultepec Park and Metro Chapultepec. Constructed by the viceroy Agustín de Ahumada, this fountain was designed to divert a water to this section of the city. It also served a decorative and historical purpose. However, it is no longer in its original location: it was restored, enlarged and moved to its current location by Roberto Alvarez Espinoza in 1921. The second fountain, Salto del Agua, was built at the intersection of Eje Central and Arcos de Belen Street, where the historic center meets Colonia Doctores and Colonia Obrera. While it is at the original location, it is not the original fountain. It had deteriorated badly, and a reproduction was made by Guillermo Ruiz. The remains of the original are on display at the Museo Nacional del Virreinato in Tepotzotlán.\n"}

Since June 2012, the CEMD has been carried out by the MBRRACE-UK (Mothers and Babies: Reducing Risk through Audits and Confidential Enquiries) collaboration, commissioned by the Healthcare Quality Improvement Partnership (HQIP).\n\nThe predecessor to MBRRACE-UK, CMACE (Centre for Maternal and Child Enquiries) produced a report every triennium, analysing all maternal deaths from the previous three years divided into topic-specific chapters. Reports are now published on an annual basis, with each report focusing on a selection of chapters. Furthermore, each MBRRACE-UK report now contains the Confidential Enquiry into Maternal Morbidity (CEMM), a study focusing on women who survived severe pregnancy problems, with the topic chosen in an open application process. The 2014 CEMM topic was maternal sepsis.\n\nThe most recent report by the CEMD (and the first by MBRRACE-UK) was published in December 2014, and focused on deaths from AFE, sepsis, haemorrhage, deaths from neurological complications, and deaths from other medical and surgical complications between 2009 and 2012. During the time that the Confidential Enquiry into Maternal Deaths has existed, there has been a fall in overall maternal deaths in the UK, with rates having fallen from 90 per 100,000 women giving birth in 1952 to around 10 per 100,000 at present.\n\nAccording to the United Nations Maternal Mortality Estimation Inter-agency Group, which consists of representatives from the World Health Organization (WHO), United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF), the United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA), United Nations Population Division, the World Bank and world-renowned academics, maternal death is:\n\n\"The death of a woman while pregnant or within 42 days of termination of pregnancy, irrespective of the duration and the site of the pregnancy, from any cause related to or aggravated by the pregnancy or its management, but not from accidental or incidental causes.”\n\nIn addition, a late maternal death is one which occurs more than six weeks but less than one year after the end of pregnancy. Maternal deaths can be further divided by cause, typically into: direct deaths, resulting from obstetric complications of the pregnant state (e.g. amniotic fluid embolism, pre-eclampsia); indirect deaths, resulting from medical or medical health conditions exacerbated by pregnancy (e.g. cardiac disease) or coincidental deaths, where the cause is unrelated to pregnancy (e.g. RTA, homicide).\n\nThe CEMD reports on all maternal deaths in the UK and Ireland, including those that are late and/or coincidental.\n\nThe current system of confidential enquiries began in 1952, however, the history of smaller, local enquiries dates back to 1917 in Aberdeen, with national enquiries across England, Scotland and Wales following in the 1920s and 1930s. Maternal deaths during this period were particularly prevalent in poor, working-class families, thus a large part of these early local enquiries was focused on the social backgrounds of the women who died. Further emphasis was placed on educating women and their families on the importance of maternity care as well as an understanding of the warning signs of complications and the importance of seeking help.\n\nDue to the large number of births taking place in non-clinical settings, avoidable clinical factors were not the only consideration. There was an emphasis on the need for health care workers to improve hygiene standards and ensure training in the use of forceps, and to ensure deliveries requiring other forms of intervention were undertaken in hospital. These local enquiries, along with various medical advances (notably the introduction of antibiotics) were credited with a sharp decline in maternal deaths in the 1930s and 1940s.\n\nIn 1952, the Ministry of Health instituted the national confidential enquiry for both England and Wales, initially to reports its findings on a three-yearly basis, and since 2014 on a yearly basis. Since its inception, the overall aims of the enquiry have been:\n\n\nIn Northern Ireland, a similar report to the CEMD was published from 1956–84, initially covering four years of maternal deaths at a time. However, due to falling maternal death rates in the country, the final reports covered a larger period of time. The final report covering years 1978-84 covered just 32 deaths. Currently, the agency NIMACH (Northern Ireland Maternal and Child Health) is responsible for collecting and analysing data in support of MBRRACE-UK.\n\nScotland also conducted a series of confidential enquiries, with the first dealing with maternal deaths from 1965-71.\n\nFor maternal deaths from 1985 onwards, a single report has been published for the whole of the United Kingdom. Since 2009, maternal deaths from the Republic of Ireland have also been included in the CEMD, with the agency MDE Ireland responsible for all data collection for maternal deaths from the Republic of Ireland.\n\nSince the first CEMD report was published in 1952, maternal deaths have fallen from 90 per 100,000 women giving birth in 1952 to around 10 per 100,000 at present. It is regarded as the ‘gold standard’ for Confidential Enquiries worldwide.\n\nA confidential enquiry is an enquiry designed to improve health and health care by collecting data, identifying any shortfalls in the care provided and devising recommendations to improve future care. They are confidential in the sense that the details of the patient/hospital/involved clinicians remain anonymous to those conducting the enquiry.\n\nThe CEMD collects and processes anonymous data of every maternal death in the UK and Ireland before they are looked at by several of the MBRRACE-UK expert assessors. MBRRACE-UK has approximately 100 assessors from different specialty groups including obstetrics, anaesthesia, intensive care, midwifery, pathology, psychiatry, general practice, emergency medicine, obstetric medicine, neurology, infectious diseases and cardiology. Each maternal death case is typically looked at by between ten and fifteen expert reviewers. All of the assessors for the CEMD are volunteers who are not remunerated for their work.\n\nOnce all data has been collected and each case has undergone review, multi-disciplinary chapter writing groups are convened, where the expert reviews of each case are examined to enable key learning themes to be drawn out for the final report. The lead member of each chapter writing group will then draft the initial chapter, which is then reviewed by the other group members and the Programme Lead before a final version is completed. Where possible, any recommendations by the CEMD are linked to national guidance from organisations such as NICE or SIGN.\n\nThe latest CEMD was published in 2014 and focused on surveillance of all maternal deaths from the period 2009-12 and confidential enquiries where the cause of death was from haemorrhage, amniotic fluid embolism, anaesthetic-related causes, neurological and other indirect causes. A further sample of survivors of septic shock were also subject to Confidential Enquiry.\n\nBetween 2009 and 2012, 357 women died in the UK and Ireland during pregnancy or within six weeks of the end of their pregnancy. 106 of these were considered to be direct maternal deaths, representing a statistically significant decrease. The number of deaths from indirect causes increased however, with 215 women dying over the four-year period. The remaining 36 deaths were classified as coincidental. It was commented in news articles, as well as in the report itself that a significant number of late maternal deaths were attributable to psychiatric causes.\n\nDespite the overall fall, the researchers claimed there are ‘key areas that the health service can look to improve in order to reduce the number of maternal deaths from these indirect causes’.\n\nThe report urged clinicians to ‘Think Sepsis’ after almost a quarter of maternal deaths were from sepsis. More specifically, the advice was for staff to take all appropriate observations and act on them when presented with an unwell pregnant (or recently pregnant) woman. Furthermore, rapid administration of intravenous antibiotics and escalating the care of the woman to senior doctors and midwives quickly were considered essential.\n\nAnother key recommendation of the report was to encourage clinicians to promote the flu vaccine to all pregnant women, with flu one of the leading causes of preventable death in pregnancy (1 in 11 of the women who died). It was reported that less than half of pregnant women eligible for a free flu vaccine had taken it up. The MBRRACE-UK report notes that of the maternal deaths caused by Flu, more than half could have been prevented had the woman received a flu jab.\n\nIn addition to the full report, MBRRACE-UK publishes an executive summary listing separate key areas for action for policy-makers, medical directors, doctors and midwives.\n\nThe executive summary, lay report and full MBRRACE-UK report is published online and available publicly.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "74845", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=74845", "title": "Contact lens", "text": "Contact lens\n\nA contact lens, or simply contacts, is a thin lens placed directly on the surface of the eye. Contact lenses are considered medical devices and can be worn to correct vision, or for cosmetic or therapeutic reasons. In 2004, it was estimated that 125 million people worldwide use contact lenses, including 28 to 38 million in the United States. In 2010, the worldwide market for contact lenses was estimated at $6.1 billion, while the US soft lens market was estimated at $2.1 billion. Multiple analysts estimated that the global market for contact lenses would reach $11.7 billion by 2015. , the average age of contact lens wearers globally was 31 years old, and two-thirds of wearers were female.\n\nPeople choose to wear contact lenses for many reasons. Aesthetics and cosmetics are the main motivating factors for people who want to avoid wearing glasses or to change the appearance of their eyes. Others wear contact lenses for functional or optical reasons. When compared with spectacles, contact lenses typically provide better peripheral vision, and do not collect moisture (from rain, snow, condensation etc.) or perspiration. This can make them preferable for sports and other outdoor activities. Contact lens wearers can also wear sunglasses, goggles, or other eyewear of their choice without having to fit them with prescription lenses or worry about compatibility with glasses. Additionally, there are conditions such as keratoconus and aniseikonia that are typically corrected better with contact lenses than with glasses.\n\nThe size of the contact lens market is likely to grow due to the increasing occurrence of eye-related conditions such as astigmatism, hyperopia and myopia. The other drivers are increasing population, the desire to make fashion statements, and technological advancement. By the end of 2020, the value of the contact lens market is predicted to reach $13.5 billion.\n\nLeonardo da Vinci is frequently credited with introducing the idea of contact lenses in his 1508 \"Codex of the eye, Manual D\", wherein he described a method of directly altering corneal power by either submerging the head in a bowl of water or wearing a water-filled glass hemisphere over the eye. Neither idea was practically implementable in da Vinci's time. He did not suggest his idea be used for correcting vision, as he was more interested in learning about the mechanisms of accommodation of the eye.\n\nDescartes proposed another idea in 1636—a glass tube filled with liquid placed in direct contact with the cornea. The protruding end was to be composed of clear glass, shaped to correct vision; however, the idea was impracticable since it made blinking impossible.\n\nIn 1801, Thomas Young made a pair of basic contact lenses based on Descartes' model. He used wax to affix water-filled lenses to his eyes, which neutralized its refractive power. He then corrected for it with another pair of lenses.\n\nHowever, like da Vinci's, Young's device was not intended to correct refraction errors. Sir John Herschel, in a footnote of the 1845 edition of the \"Encyclopedia Metropolitana\", posed two ideas for the visual correction: the first \"a spherical capsule of glass filled with animal jelly\", and \"a mould of the cornea\" that could be impressed on \"some sort of transparent medium\". Though Herschel reportedly never tested these ideas, they were both later advanced by several independent inventors such as Hungarian Dallos with István Komáromy (1929), who perfected a method of making molds from living eyes. This enabled the manufacture of lenses that, for the first time, conformed to the actual shape of the eye.\n\nIn 1888, German ophthalmologist Adolf Gaston Eugen Fick constructed and fitted the first successful contact lens. While working in Zürich, he described fabricating afocal scleral contact shells, which rested on the less sensitive rim of tissue around the cornea, and experimentally fitting them; initially on rabbits, then on himself, and lastly on a small group of volunteers. These lenses were made from heavy blown glass and were in diameter. Fick filled the empty space between cornea and glass with a dextrose solution. He published his work, \"Contactbrille\", in the journal \"Archiv für Augenheilkunde\" in March 1888.\n\nFick's lens was large and unwieldy, and could be worn only for a couple of hours at a time. August Müller in Kiel, Germany, corrected his own severe myopia with a more convenient blown-glass scleral contact lens of his own manufacture in 1888.\n\nAlso in 1887, Louis J. Girard invented a similar scleral form of contact lens. Blown-glass scleral lenses remained the only form of contact lens until the 1930s when Perspex/Plexiglas was developed, allowing plastic scleral lenses to be manufactured for the first time. In 1936, optometrist William Feinbloom introduced plastic in lenses, making them lighter and more convenient. These lenses were a combination of glass and plastic. In 1939, Hungarian optometrist Dr István Györffy produced first fully plastic lenses. Later, in 1940, German optometrist Heinrich Wöhlk produced fully plastic lenses too, based on experiments performed during the 1930s.\n\nIn 1949, the first \"corneal\" lenses were developed. These were much smaller than the original scleral lenses, as they sat only on the cornea rather than across all of the visible ocular surface, and could be worn up to sixteen hours a day. Polymethyl methacrylate (PMMA) corneal lenses became the first contact lenses to have mass appeal through the 1960s, as lens designs became more sophisticated with improving manufacturing technology. On Oct. 18, 1964, in a television studio in Washington, D. C, Lyndon Baines Johnson became the first President in the history of these United States to appear in public wearing contact lenses, under the supervision of Dr. Alan Isen, who developed the first commercially viable soft-contact lenses in the United states.\n\nEarly corneal lenses of the 1950s and '60s were relatively expensive and fragile, resulting in the development of a market for contact lens insurance. Replacement Lens Insurance, Inc. (now known as RLI Corp.) phased out its original flagship product in 1994 after contact lenses became more affordable and easier to replace.\n\nOne major disadvantage of PMMA lenses is that they allow no oxygen to get through to the conjunctiva and cornea, causing a number of adverse and potentially serious clinical effects. By the end of the 1970s and through the '80s and '90s, a range of oxygen-permeable but rigid materials were developed to overcome this problem. Chemist Norman Gaylord played a prominent role in the development of these new oxygen-permeable contact lenses. Collectively, these polymers are referred to as \"rigid gas permeable\" or RGP materials or lenses. Though all the above contact lens types—sclerals, PMMAs and RGPs—could be correctly referred to as \"rigid\" or \"hard\", the latter term is now used to the original PMMAs, which are still occasionally fitted and worn, whereas \"rigid\" is a generic term for all these lens types; thus hard lenses (PMMAs) are a subset of rigid contact lenses. Occasionally, the term \"gas permeable\" is used to describe RGPs, which is somewhat misleading as soft contact lenses are also gas permeable in that they allow oxygen to get through to the ocular surface.\nThe principal breakthrough in soft lenses was made by Czech chemists Otto Wichterle and Drahoslav Lím, who published their work \"Hydrophilic gels for biological use\" in the journal \"Nature\" in 1959. In 1965, National Patent Development Corporation (NPDC) bought the American rights to produce the lenses and then sublicensed the rights to Bausch & Lomb, which started to manufacture them in the United States. The Czech scientists' work led to the launch of the first soft (hydrogel) contact lenses in some countries in the 1960s and the first approval of the Soflens material by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in 1971. These soft lenses were soon prescribed more often than rigid ones, due to the immediate and much greater comfort (rigid lenses require a period of adaptation before full comfort is achieved). Polymers from which soft lenses are manufactured improved over the next 25 years, primarily in terms of increasing oxygen permeability, by varying the ingredients. In 1972, British optometrist Rishi Agarwal was the first to suggest disposable soft contact lenses.\n\nIn 1998, the first silicone hydrogel contact lenses were released by Ciba Vision in Mexico. These new materials encapsulated the benefits of silicone—which has extremely high oxygen permeability—with the comfort and clinical performance of the conventional hydrogels that had been used for the previous 30 years. These contact lenses were initially advocated primarily for extended (overnight) wear, although more recently, daily (no overnight) wear silicone hydrogels have been launched.\n\nIn a slightly modified molecule, a polar group is added without changing the structure of the silicone hydrogel. This is referred to as the Tanaka monomer because it was invented and patented by Kyoichi Tanaka of Menicon Co. of Japan in 1979. Second-generation silicone hydrogels, such as galyfilcon A (Acuvue Advance, Vistakon) and senofilcon A (Acuvue Oasys, Vistakon), use the Tanaka monomer. Vistakon improved the Tanaka monomer even further and added other molecules, which serve as an internal wetting agent.\n\nComfilcon A (Biofinity, CooperVision) was the first third-generation polymer. Its patent claims that the material uses two siloxy macromers of different sizes that, when used in combination, produce very high oxygen permeability (for a given water content). Enfilcon A (Avaira, CooperVision) is another third-generation material that is naturally wettable; its water content is 46%.\n\nContact lenses are classified in many different ways: by their primary function, material, wear schedule (how long a lens can be worn), and replacement schedule (how long before a lens needs to be discarded).\n\nCorrective contact lenses are designed to improve vision, most commonly by correcting refractive error. This is done by directly focusing light so it enters the eye with the proper power for clear vision.\n\nA spherical contact lens bends light evenly in every direction (horizontally, vertically, etc.). They are typically used to correct myopia and hypermetropia. A toric contact lens has a different focusing power horizontally than vertically, and as a result can correct for astigmatism. Some spherical rigid lenses can also correct for astigmatism. Because a toric lens must have the proper orientation to correct for a person's astigmatism, such a lens must have additional design characteristics to prevent it from rotating away from the ideal alignment. This can be done by weighting the bottom of the lens or by using other physical characteristics to rotate the lens back into position. Some toric contact lenses have marks or etchings that can assist the eye doctor or the user in fitting the lens. The first disposable toric contact lenses were introduced in 2000 by Vistakon.\n\nCorrection of presbyopia (a need for a reading prescription different from the prescription needed for distance) presents an additional challenge in the fitting of contact lenses. Two main strategies exist: multifocal lenses and monovision.\n\nMultifocal contact lenses (e.g. bifocals or progressives) are comparable to spectacles with bifocals or progressive lenses because they have multiple focal points. Multifocal contact lenses are typically designed for constant viewing through the center of the lens, but some designs do incorporate a shift in lens position to view through the reading power (similar to bifocal glasses).\n\nMonovision is the use of single-vision lenses (one focal point per lens) to focus an eye (typically the dominant one) for distance vision and the other for near work. The brain then learns to use this setup to see clearly at all distances. A technique called modified monovision uses multifocal lenses and also specializes one eye for distance and the other for near, thus gaining the benefits of both systems. Care is advised for persons with a previous history of strabismus and those with significant phorias, who are at risk of eye misalignment under monovision. Monovision would also be unsuitable for an individual with only one functional eye. Studies have shown no adverse effect to driving performance in adapted monovision contact lens wearers.\n\nAlternatively, a person may simply wear reading glasses over their distance contact lenses.\n\nFor those with certain color deficiencies, a red-tinted \"X-Chrom\" contact lens may be used. Although such a lens does not restore normal color vision, it allows some color-blind people to distinguish colors better. Red-filtering contact lenses can also be an option for extreme light sensitivity in some visual deficiencies such as achromatopsia.\n\nChromaGen contact lenses have been used and shown to have some limitations with vision at night although otherwise producing significant improvements in color vision. An earlier study showed very significant improvements in color vision and patient satisfaction.\n\nLater work that used these ChromaGen lenses with dyslexics in a randomised, double-blind, placebo controlled trial showed highly significant improvements in reading ability over reading without the lenses. This system has been granted FDA approval for use in the United States.\n\nMagnification is another area being researched for future contact lens applications. Embedding of telescopic lenses and electronic components suggests that future uses of contact lenses may become extremely diverse. However, there are still barriers that prevent transition of these technologies, from research and development to practical application and commercial availability.\n\nA cosmetic contact lens is designed to change the appearance of the eye. These lenses may also correct refractive error. Although many brands of contact lenses are lightly tinted to make them easier to handle, cosmetic lenses worn to change eye color are far less common, accounting for only 3% of contact lens fits in 2004.\n\nIn the United States, the FDA labels non-corrective cosmetic contact lenses as \"decorative contact lenses\". Like any contact lens, cosmetic lenses carry risks of mild to serious complications, including ocular redness, irritation and infection.\n\nDue to their medical nature, colored contact lenses, similar to regular ones, are illegal to purchase in the United States without a valid prescription. Those with perfect vision can buy color contacts for cosmetic reasons, but they still need their eyes to be measured for a \"plano\" prescription, meaning one with zero vision correction. This is for safety reasons so the lenses will fit the eye without causing irritation or redness.\n\nSome colored contact lenses completely cover the iris, thus dramatically changing eye colour. Other colored contact lenses merely tint the iris, highlighting and beautifying its natural colour. A new trend in Japan, South Korea and China is the circle contact lens, which extend the appearance of the iris onto the sclera by having a dark tinted area all around. The result is an appearance of a bigger, wider iris, a look reminiscent of dolls' eyes.\n\nOne of the drawbacks of cosmetic lenses is not knowing how they will look before physically trying them on. This has led to an industry where lens retailers are heavily influenced by cutting edge digital fashion technology, specifically the Virtual Dressing Room technology. Virtual Dressing Room technology offers users the option to upload a photo so they can virtually try on different lenses and experience how they will look before committing to a purchase. Examples of retailers that currently offer this technology are Freshlook Color Studios and Colorful Eyes.\n\nCosmetic lenses can have more direct medical applications. For example, some contact lenses can restore the appearance and, to some extent the function, of a damaged or missing iris.\n\nA scleral lens is a large, firm, oxygen permeable contact lens that rests on the sclera and creates a tear-filled vault over the cornea. The cause of this unique positioning is usually relevant to a specific patient whose cornea is too sensitive to support the lens directly. Scleral lenses may be used to improve vision and reduce pain and light sensitivity for people suffering from a growing number of disorders or injuries to the eye, such as severe dry eye syndrome (Kerotanconjuctivis sicca), microphthalmia, keratoconus, corneal ectasia, Stevens–Johnson syndrome, Sjögren's syndrome, aniridia, neurotrophic keratitis (aneasthetic corneas), complications post-LASIK, high order Aberrations of the eye, complications post-corneal transplant and pellucid degeneration. Injuries to the eye such as surgical complications, distorted corneal implants, as well as chemical and burn injuries also may be treated with scleral lenses.\nSoft lenses are often used in the treatment and management of non-refractive disorders of the eye. A bandage contact lens protects an injured or diseased cornea from the constant rubbing of blinking eyelids thereby allowing it to heal. They are used in the treatment of conditions including bullous keratopathy, dry eyes, corneal abrasions and erosion, keratitis, corneal edema, descemetocele, corneal ectasis, Mooren's ulcer, anterior corneal dystrophy, and neurotrophic keratoconjunctivitis. Contact lenses that deliver drugs to the eye have also been developed.\n\nGlass lenses were never comfortable enough to gain widespread popularity. The first lenses to do so were those made from polymethyl methacrylate (PMMA or Perspex/Plexiglas), now commonly referred to as \"hard\" lenses. Their main disadvantage is they do not allow oxygen to pass through to the cornea, which can cause a number of adverse, and often serious, clinical events. Starting in the late 1970s, improved rigid materials which were oxygen-permeable were developed. Contact lenses made from these materials are called rigid gas permeable lenses or 'RGPs'.\n\nA rigid lens is able to cover the natural shape of the cornea with a new refracting surface. This means that a spherical rigid contact lens can correct corneal astigmatism. Rigid lenses can also be made as a front-toric, back-toric, or bitoric. Rigid lenses can also correct corneas with irregular geometries, such as those with keratoconus or post surgical ectasias. In most cases, patients with keratoconus see better through rigid lenses than through glasses. Rigid lenses are more chemically inert, allowing them to be worn in more challenging environments than soft lenses.\n\nSoft lenses are more flexible than rigid lenses, and can be gently rolled or folded without damaging the lens. While rigid lenses require a period of adaptation before comfort is achieved, new soft lens wearers typically report lens awareness rather than pain or discomfort.\n\nHydrogel lenses rely on their water content to transmit oxygen through the lens to the cornea. As a result, higher water content lenses allowed more oxygen to the cornea. In 1998, silicone hydrogel, or Si-hy lenses became available. These materials have both the extremely high oxygen permeability of silicone and the comfort and clinical performance of the conventional hydrogels. Because silicone allows more oxygen permeability than water, oxygen permeability of silicone hydrogels is not tied to the lenses' water content. Lenses have now been developed with so much oxygen permeability that they are approved for overnight wear (extended wear). Lenses approved for daily wear are also available in silicone hydrogel materials.\n\nDisadvantages of silicone hydrogels are that they are slightly stiffer and the lens surface can be hydrophobic, thus less \"wettable\" – factors that can influence comfort of lens use. New manufacturing techniques and changes to multipurpose solutions have minimized these effects. A surface modification process called plasma coating alters the lens surface's hydrophobic nature. Another technique incorporates internal rewetting agents to make the lens surface hydrophilic. A third process uses longer backbone polymer chains that results in less cross linking and increased wetting without surface alterations or additive agents.\n\nCurrent brands of soft lenses are either traditional hydrogel or silicone hydrogel. Because of drastic differences in oxygen permeability, replacement schedule, and other design characteristics, it is very important to follow the instructions of the eye care professional prescribing the lenses.\n\nA small number of hybrid lenses exist. Typically these contact lenses consist of a rigid center and a soft \"skirt\". A similar technique is the \"piggybacking\" of a smaller, rigid lens on the surface of a larger, soft lens. These techniques are often chosen to give the vision correction benefits of a rigid lens and the comfort of a soft lens.\n\nA \"daily wear\" (DW) contact lens is designed to be worn for one day and removed before sleeping. An \"extended wear\" (EW) contact lens is designed for continuous overnight wear, typically for up to 6 consecutive nights. Newer materials, such as silicone hydrogels, allow for even longer wear periods of up to 30 consecutive nights; these longer-wear lenses are often referred to as \"continuous wear\" (CW). EW and CW contact lenses can be worn overnight because of their high oxygen permeability. While awake, the eyes are mostly open, allowing oxygen from the air to dissolve into the tears and pass through the lens to the cornea. While asleep, oxygen is supplied from the blood vessels in the back of the eyelid. A lens hindering passage of oxygen to the cornea causes corneal hypoxia which can result in serious complications, such as corneal ulcer that, if left untreated, can permanently decrease vision. EW and CW contact lenses typically allow for a transfer of 5–6 times more oxygen than conventional softs, allowing the cornea to remain healthy, even with closed eyelids.\n\nWearing lenses designed for daily wear overnight has an increased risk for corneal infections, corneal ulcers and corneal neovascularization—this latter condition, once it sets in, cannot be reversed and will eventually spoil vision acuity through diminishing corneal transparency. The most common complication of extended wear is giant papillary conjunctivitis (GPC), sometimes associated with a poorly fitting contact lens.\n\nContact lenses are often categorized by their replacement schedule. Single use lenses (called 1-day or daily disposables) are discarded after one use. Because they do not have to stand up to the wear and tear of repeated uses, these lenses can be made thinner and lighter, greatly improving their comfort. Lenses replaced frequently gather fewer deposits of allergens and germs, making these lenses preferable for patients with ocular allergies or for those who are prone to infection. Single-use lenses are also useful for people who wear contact lenses infrequently, or when losing a lens is likely or not easily replaced (such as when on vacation). They are also considered useful for children because cleaning or disinfecting is not needed, leading to improved compliance.\n\nOther disposable contact lenses are designed for replacement every two or four weeks. Quarterly or annual lenses, which used to be very common, are much less so. Rigid gas permeable lenses are very durable and may last for several years without the need for replacement. PMMA hards were very durable and were commonly worn for 5 to 10 years, but had several drawbacks.\n\nLenses with different replacement schedules can be made of the same material. Although the materials are alike, differences in the manufacturing processes determine if the resulting lens will be a \"daily disposable\" or one recommended for two or four week replacement. However, sometimes manufacturers use absolutely identical lenses and just repackage them with different labels.\n\nTypically, soft contact lenses are mass-produced, while rigids are custom-made to exact specifications for the individual patient.\n\n\nMany companies make contact lenses. In the United States, there are five major manufacturers:\n\nThe parameters specified in a contact lens prescription may include:\n\nPrescriptions for contact lenses and glasses may be similar, but are not interchangeable. Prescribing of contact lenses is usually restricted to various combinations of ophthalmologists, optometrists and opticians. An eye examination is needed to determine an individual's suitability for contact lens wear. This typically includes a refraction to determine the proper power of the lens and an assessment of the health of the eye's anterior segment. Many eye diseases prohibits contact lens wear, such as active infections, allergies, and dry eye. Keratometry is especially important in the fitting of rigid lenses.\n\nContact lenses are prescribed by ophthalmologists, optometrists, or specially licensed opticians under the supervision of an eye doctor. Contact lenses can typically be ordered at the office that conducts the eye exam and fitting. The Fairness to Contact Lens Consumers Act gives consumers the right to obtain a copy of their contact lens prescription, allowing them to fill it at the lens provider of their choice.\n\nContact lenses are generally safe as long as they are used correctly. Complications from contact lens wear affect roughly 5% of wearers yearly. Factors leading to eye damage varies, and improper use of a contact lens may affect the eyelid, the conjunctiva, and, most of all, the whole structure of the cornea. Poor lens care can lead to infections by various microorganisms including bacteria, fungi, and \"Acanthamoeba\" (\"Acanthamoeba\" keratitis).\n\nMany complications arise when contact lenses are worn not as prescribed (improper wear schedule or lens replacement). Sleeping in lenses not designed or approved for extended wear is a common cause of complications. Many people go too long before replacing their contacts, wearing lenses designed for 1, 14, or 30 days of wear for multiple months or years. While this does save on the cost of lenses, it risks permanent damage to the eye and even loss of sight.\n\nOne of the major factors that causes complications is that the contact lens is an oxygen barrier. The cornea needs a constant supply of oxygen to remain completely transparent and function as it should; it normally gets that oxygen from the surrounding air while awake, and from the blood vessels in the back of the eyelid while asleep. The most prominent risks associated with long-term, chronic low oxygen to the cornea include corneal neovascularization, increased epithelial permeability, bacterial adherence, microcysts, corneal edema, endothelial polymegethism, dry eye and potential increase in myopia. That is why much of the research into the latest soft and rigid contact lens materials has centered on improving oxygen transmission through the lens.\n\nMishandling of contact lenses can also cause problems. Corneal abrasions can increase the chances of infection. When combined with improper cleaning and disinfection of the lens, a risk of infection further increases. Decreased corneal sensitivity after extended contact lens wear may cause a patient to miss some of the earliest symptoms of such complications.\n\nThe way contact lenses interact with the natural tear layer is a major factor in determining lens comfort and visual clarity. People suffering from dry eyes are particularly vulnerable to discomfort and episodes of brief blurry vision. Proper lens selection can minimize these effects.\n\nLong-term wear (over five years) of contact lenses may \"decrease the entire corneal thickness and increase the corneal curvature and surface irregularity.\" Long-term wear of rigid contacts is associated with decreased corneal keratocyte density and increased number of epithelial Langerhans cells.\n\nAll contact lenses sold in the United States are studied and approved as safe by the FDA when specific handling and care procedures, wear schedules, and replacement schedules are followed.\n\nBefore touching the contact lens or the eye, it is important to wash hands thoroughly with soap and rinse well. Soaps containing moisturizers or allergens should be avoided as these can cause eye irritation. Drying of hands using towels or tissues before handling contact lenses can transfer lint (fluff) to the hands and, subsequently, to the lenses, causing irritation upon insertion. Towels, unless freshly laundered on high temperature wash, are frequently contaminated with large quantities of bacteria and, as such, should be avoided when handling lenses. Dust, lint and other debris may collect on the outside of contact lenses. Again, hand contact with this material, before handling contact lenses, may transfer it to the lenses themselves. Rinsing the case under a source of clean running water, before opening it, can help alleviate this problem. Next the lens should be removed from its case and inspected for defects (e.g. splits, folds, lint). A 'gritty' or rough appearance to the lens surface may indicate that a considerable quantity of proteins, lipids and debris has built up on it and that additional cleaning is required; this is often accompanied and felt by unusually high irritation upon insertion.\n\nMake sure the soft lens is not inserted inside-out. Edge of a lens turned inside out has a different appearance, especially when the lens is slightly folded. Insertion of an inside-out lens for a brief time (less than one minute) should not cause any damage to the eye. Some brands of lenses have markings (e.g. numbers) on the rim that make it easier to tell the front of the lens from the back.\n\nThe technique for removing or inserting a contact lens varies depending upon whether the lens is soft or rigid. There are many subtle variations to insertion and removal techniques. Because of differences in anatomy, manual dexterity, and visual limitations, every person must find the technique that works best for them. In all cases, the insertion and removal of lenses requires some training and practice on part of the user.\n\nContact lenses are typically inserted into the eye by placing them on the pad of the index or middle finger with the concave side upward and then using that finger to place the lens on the eye. Rigid lenses should be placed directly on the cornea. Soft lenses may be placed on the sclera (white of the eye) and then slid into place. Another finger of the same hand, or a finger of the other hand, is used to keep the eye wide open. Alternatively, the user may close their eyes and then look towards their nose, sliding the lens into place over the cornea. Problems may arise if the lens folds, turns inside-out, slides off the finger prematurely, or adheres more tightly to the finger than the eye surface. A drop of solution may help the lens adhere to the eye.\n\nWhen the lens first contacts the eye, it should be comfortable. By making sure that particular attention is given to the eyelid margins for the presence of inflammation and signs of debris in the lashes, wearing contact lenses should be easy. A brief period of irritation may occur, caused by a difference in pH and/or salinity between that of the lens solution and the tear. This discomfort fades quickly as the solution drains away and is replaced by the natural tears. However, if irritation persists, the cause could be a dirty, damaged, or inside-out lens. Removing and inspecting it for damage and proper orientation, and re-cleaning if necessary, should correct the problem. If discomfort continues, the lens should not be worn. In some cases, taking a break from lens wear for a day may correct the problem. In case of severe discomfort, or if it does not resolve by the next day, the person should be seen as soon as possible by an eye doctor to rule out potentially serious complications.\n\nRemoving contact lenses incorrectly could result in damage to the lens and injury to the eye so certain precautions must be taken. Rigid contact lenses can best be removed by pulling the eyelid tight and then blinking, whereupon the lens drops out. With one finger on the outer corner of the eyelids, or lateral canthus, the person stretches the eyelids towards the ear; the increased tension of the eyelid margins against the edge of lens allows the blink to break the capillary action that adheres the lens to the eye. The other hand is typically cupped underneath the eye to catch the lens as it drops out. For soft lenses, which have a stronger adherence to the eye surface, this technique is less suitable.\n\nA soft contact lens may be removed by pinching the edge between the thumb and index finger. Moving the lens off the cornea first can improve comfort during removal and reduce risk of scratching the cornea with a fingernail. It is also possible to push or pull a soft lens far enough to the side or bottom of the eyeball to get it to fold then fall out, without pinching and thereby damaging it. If these techniques are used with a rigid lens, it may scratch the cornea.\n\nThere are also small tools specifically for removing lenses. Usually made of flexible plastic, they resemble small tweezers, or plungers that suction onto the front of the lens. Typically these tools are used only with rigid lenses. Extreme care must be exercised when using mechanical tools or fingernails to insert or remove contact lenses.\n\nLens care varies depending on material and wear schedule. Daily disposables are discarded after a single use and thus require no cleaning. Other lenses need regular cleaning and disinfecting to prevent surface coating and infections.\n\nThere are many ways to clean and care for contact lenses, typically called care systems or lens solutions:\n\nAside from cleaning the contact lenses, it is highly advised to also clean the cases to avoid any possible infection. Replacing the case monthly, and storing it in a clean and safe environment is also recommended.\n\nContact lenses can be mechanically cleaned of more substantial protein, lipid and debris build up by rubbing them between the clean pad of a finger and the palm of a hand, using a small amount of cleaning fluid as a lubricant. However, this method does not sterilize the lenses and so should be performed only before a full sterilization cycle (e.g. when putting the contact lens away at night).\n\nSome products must be used only with certain types of contact lenses. Water alone will not at all disinfect the lens, and can lead to lens contamination causing potentially irreparable harm to the eye.\n\nContact lens solutions often contain preservatives such as benzalkonium chloride and benzyl alcohol. Preservative-free products usually have shorter shelf lives, but are better suited for individuals with an allergy or sensitivity to a preservative. In the past, thiomersal was used as a preservative. In 1989, thiomersal was responsible for about 10% of problems related to contact lenses. As a result, most products no longer contain thiomersal.\n\nA large segment of current contact lens research is directed towards the treatment and prevention of conditions resulting from contact lens contamination and colonization by foreign organisms. Clinicians tend to agree that the most significant complication of contact lens wear is microbial keratitis and that the most predominant microbial pathogen is \"Pseudomonas aeruginosa\". Other organisms are also major causative factors in bacterial keratitis associated with contact lens wear, although their prevalence varies across different locations. These include both the \"Staphylococcus\" species (\"aureus\" and \"epidermidis\") and the \"Streptococcus\" species, among others. Microbial keratitis is a serious focal point of current research due to its potentially devastating effect on the eye, including severe vision loss.\n\nOne specific research topic of interest is how microbes such as \"Pseudomonas aeruginosa\" invade the eye and cause infection. Although the pathogenesis of microbial keratitis is not well understood, many different factors have been investigated. One group of researchers showed that corneal hypoxia exacerbated \"Pseudomonas\" binding to the corneal epithelium, internalization of the microbes, and induction of the inflammatory response. One way to alleviate hypoxia is to increase the amount of oxygen transmitted to the cornea. Although silicone-hydrogel lenses almost eliminate hypoxia in patients due to their very high levels of oxygen transmissibility, they also seem to provide a more efficient platform for bacterial contamination and corneal infiltration than other conventional hydrogel soft contact lenses. A recent study showed that \"Pseudomonas aeruginosa\" and \"Staphylococcus epidermis\" adhere much more strongly to unworn silicone hydrogel contact lenses than conventional hydrogel lenses and that adhesion of \"Pseudomonas aeruginosa\" was 20 times stronger than that of \"Staphylococcus epidermidis\". This might partly explain why \"Pseudomonas\" infections are the most predominant. However, another study conducted with worn and unworn silicone and conventional hydrogel contact lenses showed that worn silicone contact lenses were less prone to \"Staphylococcus epidermidis\" colonization than conventional hydrogel lenses.\n\nAnother important area of contact lens research deals with patient compliance. Compliance is a major issue pertaining to the use of contact lenses because patient noncompliance often leads to contamination of the lens, storage case, or both. However, careful users can extend the wear of lenses through proper handling: there is, unfortunately, no disinterested research on the issue of \"compliance\" or the length of time a user can safely wear a lens beyond its stated use. The introduction of multipurpose solutions and daily disposable lenses have helped to alleviate some of the problems observed from inadequate cleaning but new methods of combating microbial contamination are currently being developed. A silver-impregnated lens case has been developed which helps to eradicate any potentially contaminating microbes that come in contact with the lens case. Additionally, a number of antimicrobial agents are being developed that have been embedded into contact lenses themselves. Lenses with covalently attached selenium molecules have been shown to reduce bacterial colonization without adversely affecting the cornea of a rabbit eye and octyl glucoside used as a lens surfactant significantly decreases bacterial adhesion. These compounds are of particular interest to contact lens manufacturers and prescribing optometrists because they do not require any patient compliance to effectively attenuate the effects of bacterial colonization.\n\nA recent area of research is in the field of bionic lenses. These are visual displays that include built-in electric circuits and light-emitting diodes and can harvest radio waves for their electric power. Bionic lenses can display information beamed from a mobile device overcoming the small display size problem. The technology involves embedding nano and microscale electronic devices in lenses. These lenses will also need to have an array of microlenses to focus the image so that it appears suspended in front of the wearer’s eyes. The lens could also serve as a head-up display for pilots or gamers.\n\nDrug administration through contact lenses is also becoming an area of research. One application is a lens that releases anesthesia to the eye for post-surgery pain relief, especially after PRK (photorefractive keratectomy) in which the healing process takes several days. One experiment shows that silicone contact lenses that contain vitamin E deliver pain medication for up to seven days compared with less than two hours in usual lenses.\n\nAnother study of the usage of contact lens is aimed to address the issue of macular degeneration (AMD or age-related macular degeneration). An international collaboration of researchers was able to develop a contact lens that can shift between magnified and normal vision. Previous solutions to AMD included bulky glasses or surgical implants. But the advancement of this new contact lens, which is made of polymethyl methacrylate, could offer an unobtrusive solution.\n\nOne of the earliest known motion pictures to introduce the use of contact lenses as a make-up artist's device for enhancing the eyes was by the innovative actor Lon Chaney in the 1926 film \"The Road to Mandalay\" to create the effect of a character who had a blind eye. Dr. Rueben Greenspoon applied them to Orson Welles for the film \"Citizen Kane\" in 1940. In the 1950s, contact lenses were starting to be used in British color horror films. An early example of this is the British actor Christopher Lee as the Dracula character in the 1958 color horror film \"Dracula\", which helped to emphasize his horrific looking black pupils and red bloodshot eyes. Tony Curtis wore them in the 1968 film \"The Boston Strangler\". Contact lenses were also used to better emphasize the sinister gaze of the demonic characters in 1968's \"Rosemary's Baby\" and 1973's \"The Exorcist\". Colored custom-made contact lenses are now standard makeup for a number of special effects-based movies.\n\n\n"}

The pieces of legislation the regulations revoked and replaced were the 'Control of Asbestos at Work Regulations 2002', the 'Asbestos (Licensing) Regulations 1983' and the 'Asbestos (Prohibitions) Regulations 1992'. Key elements of the regulations include a greater emphasis on training requiring anyone who may come into contact with Asbestos in the course of their work to be given suitable training. Greater restrictions were also placed on the amount of exposure workers could be exposed to in the form of 'control limits'. The recently published 'Asbestos: The survey guide' (HSG264) is complementary to these regulations. When work with asbestos is being carried out the Regulations place a requirement on employers and self-employed workers to prevent exposure to asbestos fibres. \n\nThe Control of Asbestos 2006 regulations brought together three separate pieces of legislation which covered the prohibition of Asbestos, the control of asbestos at work and asbestos licensing. They prohibit the import, supply and use of all types of asbestos and also continue to ban the second hand use of asbestos products such as asbestos boards and tiles. The regulations require mandatory training to be given to anyone who may be exposed to asbestos whilst at work. This regulation will enable contracted workers on site to assess correctly the nature of a material before work is carried out, thus eliminating the risk of uncontrolled damage to Asbestos Containing Materials. Maintenance workers who may be coming onto a premises to carry out a job must also be given training. Should work need to be carried out that may result in the disturbing of asbestos then all measures should be taken to limit the exposure to asbestos fibres. Any exposure to those fibres should be below the 'airborne exposure limit' of 0.1 fibres per cm³. The control limit is the maximum concentration of asbestos fibres in the air if measured over any continuous 4 hour period. Any short term exposure to asbestos, as measured by continuous exposure over 10 minutes, should not exceed 0.6 fibres per cm³. These exposures must be strictly controlled with respiratory protective equipment if exposure can be reduced in no other way. In terms of asbestos removal, any work should be carried out by a licensed contractor although any decision as to whether work is 'licensable' is based on the risk. Anyone working on asbestos under the regulations must have a license issued by the Health and Safety Executive. \n\nOn 9 June 2009 a company in Swansea, Val Inco Europe Ltd, pleaded guilty to four charges under the Control of Asbestos Regulations and were fined £12,000 and ordered to pay £28,000 costs. The charges were in relation to work carried out by a contractor, A-Weld, on a furnace at the companies premises. Although asbestos surveys had been carried out on their site, the interior of the plant and equipment had not been surveyed. As a result, asbestos insulation material was disturbed and broken potentially giving rise to powders and fibres. Workers on the site also discovered a 'white material' which they believed to be asbestos and although the sample was sent away for tests, the site was not isolated and the work was allowed to continue. HSE principal inspector Andrew Knowles said that an \"important aspect was the failure to provide asbestos awareness training for employees, which is a specific requirement where asbestos may be present in a workplace\". He added \"The failures in this case were entirely preventable and the defendant fell far short of the high standards required. This should serve as a warning to others about the dangers of asbestos and the legal requirement to manage it properly.\"\n\nAsbestos is a naturally occurring group of silicate minerals that can readily be separated into thin strong fibres that are flexible, heat resistant and chemically inert. Within the United Kingdom and elsewhere in the world, asbestos was used extensively as a building material from the 1950s to the 1980s. It was used as a means of fireproofing as well as insulation and any building built before 2000 could contain asbestos. Although Asbestos can be safe if the material is kept in good condition and undisturbed, if damaged asbestos fibres could become airborne and cause serious risks to health if inhaled. Serious diseases including mesothelioma, lung cancer, and asbestosis could result if someone were to breathe in high levels of asbestos fibres. A particular risk if someone were to be working either on, or with, asbestos materials which had been damaged. There are six forms of Asbestos although only three are commonly used, these are Chrysotile (white asbestos), the most common; Amosite (brown asbestos) which can often be found in ceiling tiles and as a fire retardant in thermal insulation products; Crocidolite (blue asbestos), commonly used in high temperature applications.\n"}

This process includes consideration of the individual social, cultural, and feelings needs of patients for effective cross-cultural communication with their health care providers. The goal of cultural competence in health care is to reduce health disparities and to provide optimal care to patients regardless of their race, gender, ethnic background, native languages spoken, and religious or cultural beliefs. Cultural competency training is important in health care fields where human interaction is common, including medicine, nursing, allied health, mental health, social work, pharmacy, oral health, and public health fields.\n\nThe term cultural competence was first used by Terry L. Cross and colleagues in 1989, but it was not until almost a decade later that health care professionals began to be formally educated and trained in cultural competence. In 2002, cultural competence in health care emerged as a field and has been increasingly embedded into medical education curriculum since then.\n\nAlthough cultural competence in healthcare is a global concept, it is primarily practiced in the United States.\n\nCultural competence is defined as a set of congruent behaviors, attitudes, and policies that come together in a system, agency, or among professionals and that enables them to work effectively in cross-cultural situations. Essential elements that enable organizations to become culturally competent include valuing diversity, having the capacity for cultural self-assessment, being conscious of the dynamics inherent when cultures interact, having institutionalized cultural knowledge, and having developed adaptations to service delivery reflecting an understanding of cultural diversity. By definition, diversity includes differences in race, ethnicity, age, gender, size, religion, sexual orientation, and physical and mental ability. Accordingly, organizations should include these considerations in all aspects of policy making, administration, practice, and service delivery.\n\nCultural competence involves more than having sensitivity or awareness of cultures. It necessitates an active process of learning and developing skills to engage effectively in cross-cultural situations and re-evaluating these skills over time. Cultural competence is often used interchangeably with the term cultural competency.\n\nA healthcare system, sometimes referred to as health system, is the organization of people, institutions, and resources that deliver healthcare services to meet the health needs of target populations. A culturally competent health system not only recognizes and accepts the importance of cultural diversity at every level but also assesses the cross-cultural relations, stays vigilant towards any changes and developments resulting from cultural diversity, broadens cultural knowledge, and adapts services to meet the needs that are culturally-unique.\n\nAs more and more immigrants are coming to America, healthcare professionals with good cultural competence can use the knowledge and sensitivity that they obtain in order to provide holistic care for clients from other countries, who speak foreign languages. The challenges for American healthcare systems to meet the health needs of the increasing number of diverse patients are becoming very obvious. The challenges include but are not limited to the following:\n\nIn response to a rapid growth of minorities population in the United States, healthcare organizations have responded by providing new services and undergoing health reforms in terms of diversity in leadership and workforce. Despite improvements and progress seen in some areas, minorities are still underrepresented within both healthcare leadership and workforce. To improve the weak minorities representation in leadership and workforce, an organization must acknowledge the importance of cultures, be sensitive to cultural differences, and establish strategic plans to incorporate cultural diversity.\n\nAccording to the national survey of the U.S. healthcare leaders conducted by the search firm Witt/Kieffer, respondents viewed diverse leadership as a valuable business builder. They associated it with improved patient satisfaction, successful decision-making, improved clinical outcomes, and stronger bottom line.\n\nTo successfully recruit, mentor, and coach minority leaders in healthcare, it is important to keep these social science principles and cultural values in mind: \n\nTo provide culturally sensitive patient-centered care, physicians should treat each patient as an individual, recognizing and respecting his or her beliefs, values and care seeking behaviors. However, many physicians lack the awareness of or training in cultural competence. With the constantly changing demographics, their patients are increasingly getting diverse as well. It is utterly important to educate physicians to be culturally competent so that they can effectively treat patients of different cultural and ethnic backgrounds. \n\nImplicit bias aimed towards certain races or ethnicities is frequent in the healthcare field, specifically in the United States, commonly with Black Americans, Hispanic Americans, and American Indians. Subconscious discrimination occurs regardless of the advancement of disease prevention in the United States, as shown by the significantly high mortality rates of the groups mentioned earlier in the paragraph. This discrimination is shaped by attitudes of healthcare professionals, who often differ in effort and type of treatment based on the race and physical appearance of a patient. Carrying over to the diagnosis and treatment of minority patients, the disparities in quality of healthcare increase the likelihood of developing diseases such as asthma, HIV/AIDs and other life-threatening diseases. For example, a study that focused on the treatment and diagnosis differences between black women and white women in regards to breast cancer indicated this discrimination against minorities and its effects. Furthermore, the study indicated that \"white women are more likely to be diagnosed with breast cancer, [and] Black women are more likely to die from it.\" \n\nThe differences in responses from healthcare professionals to black patients versus white patients is drastic, indicated by subconscious negative perceptions of various races. In a study that evaluated physicians' immediate assumptions made about different races \"two-thirds of the clinicians subconsciously formed a bias against Blacks (43% moderate to strong) and Latinos (51% moderate to strong)\". Without intentionally concocting stereotypes about patients, these clinicians are indirectly negatively affecting the patients they mistreat. To remedy this, the study expresses support for clinicians to form a stronger connection with each patient and to focus on the patient at hand, rather than considering their race or background. This will help to prevent negative attitudes and tones when speaking with patients, creating a positive atmosphere that allows for equal environments and treatments for all patients, regardless of race or physical appearance. \n\nIn response to the increasingly diverse population, several states (WA, CA, CT, NJ, NM) have passed legislation requiring or strongly recommending cultural competency training for physicians. In 2005, New Jersey legislature enacted a law requiring all physicians to complete at least 6 hours of training in cultural competency as a condition for renewal of their New Jersey medical license, whether or not they actively practice in New Jersey. Physicians' responses to this CME requirement varied, both positively and negatively. But the overall feedback was positive towards the outcomes of participation in and satisfaction with the programs.\n\nIn order to provide culturally competent care for their diverse patients, physicians should at the first step understand that patients' cultures can influence profoundly how they define health and illness, how they seek health care, and what constitutes appropriate treatment. They should also realize that their clinical care process could also be influenced by their own personal and professional experiences as well as biomedical culture. Dr. Like pointed out in one of his articles that \"in transforming systems, transcultural nurses, physicians, and other health care professionals need to remember that cultural humility and cultural competence must go hand in hand.\"\n\nCultural competence in research is the ability of researchers and research staff to provide high quality research that takes into account the culture and diversity of a population when developing research ideas, design, and methodology. Cultural competence can be crucial for ensuring that the sampling is representative of the population and therefore application to a diverse number of people. It is important that a study's subject enrollment reflect as closely as possible the target population of those affected by the health problem being studied.\n\nIn 1994, the National Institutes of Health established policy (Public Law 103-43) for the inclusion of women, children, and members of minority groups and their subpopulations in biomedical and behavioral clinical studies. Overcoming challenges to cultural competence in research also means that institutional review board membership should include representatives of large communities and cultural groups as representatives.\n\nThe critical importance of training medical students to be future culturally competent physicians has been recognized by accrediting bodies such as the Accreditation Council on Graduate Medical Education (ACGME) and the Liaison Committee on Medical Education (LCME) and other medical organizations such as American Medical Association (AMA) and the Institute of Medicine (IOM).\n\nCulture is definitely beyond ethnicity and race. Healthcare professionals need to learn about the tolerance of other's beliefs. Professional care is about meeting patients' needs even if they do not align with the caretaker's personal beliefs. Discovering one's own beliefs and their origin (from upbringing or modeling of parents, for example) helps understand what is believed and moderates actions at times when others are cared for with different beliefs. As a result, it is essential for healthcare professionals to practice cultural competence and recognize the differences as well as cultural sensitivities to provide holistic care for the patients.\n\nAccording to the LCME standard for cultural competence, \"the faculty and students must demonstrate an understanding of the manner in which people of diverse culture and belief systems perceive health and illness and respond to various symptoms, diseases, and treatments.\" In response to the mandates, medical schools in the U.S. have incorporated teaching cultural competency in their curricula. A search on cultural competency in the curriculum of a medical school revealed that it was covered in 33 events in 13 courses in spring 2014. A similar search was performed on health disparities yielding 16 events in 10 courses covering the topic.\n\nThe cultural competence curriculum is intended to improve the interaction between patients and physicians and to assure that students will possess the knowledge, skills, and attitudes that enable them to provide high quality and culturally competent care to patients and their families as well as the general medical community.\n\nA \"visual intervention\" was completed to educate healthcare professionals on the dangers of subconscious discrimination toward minority groups in order to lessen the common discrimination certain races or ethnicities face in a healthcare setting. This study allowed for physicians to focus more on the problems of their patients, and truly listening to their issues. By creating a supportive space that fosters a strong channel of communication, the study targeted the lack of connection between healthcare professionals and patients due to either language barriers or the patient's mistrust in the professional.\n\nPatient-Physician communication involves two sides. While physicians and other healthcare providers are being encouraged or required to be culturally competent in delivery of quality healthcare, it would be reasonable to encourage patients as well to be culturally sensitive and be aware that not all health care providers are equally competent in cultures. When it comes to illness, cultural beliefs and values affect greatly a patient's behavior in seeking healthcare. They should try their best to communicate their concerns relating to their beliefs, values and other cultural factors that might affect care and treatment to their physicians and other healthcare providers. If effective communication is unlikely achieved, then they should be provided with language assistance and interpretation services. Recognizing that patients receive the best care when they work in partnership with doctors, the General Medical Council issued guidance for patients \"What to expect from your doctor: a guide for patients\" in April 2013.\n\nLinguistic competence involves communicating effectively with diverse populations, including individuals with limited English proficiency (LEP), low literacy skills or are not literate, disabilities, and individuals with any degree of hearing loss. According to the U.S. Census in 2011, 25.3 million people are considered limited English proficient, accounting for 9% of the U.S. population. Hospitals frequently admit LEP patients for treatment. With cultural and linguistic barriers, it is not surprising that it is hard to achieve effective communication between the health care providers and the LEP patients.\n\nIn order to improve communication and mutual understanding, health care systems have used the professionally trained interpreters to help health care providers to communicate with patients whose English proficiency is limited. Studies have shown that trained professional interpreters or bilingual health care professionals have a positive effect on LEP patients' satisfaction, their quality of care, and outcomes.\n\nThe National Culturally and Linguistically Appropriate Services (CLAS) Standards in Health and Health Care developed by the Office of Minority Health (OMH) are intended to advance health equity, improve quality and help eliminate health care disparities. The three themes of the fifteen CLAS standards areGovernance, Leadership, and workforce; Communication and Language Assistance; and Engagement, Continuous Improvement, and Accountability. The standards clearly emphasized that the top levels of an organizational leadership hold the responsibility for CLAS implementation, and that language assistance should be provided when needed, and quality improvement, community engagement, and evaluation are importance. that is a very good resource for healthcare systems and organizations to follow to become culturally and linguistically competent in the delivery of health care.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "16767087", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=16767087", "title": "Cure", "text": "Cure\n\nA cure is a substance or procedure that ends a medical condition, such as a medication, a surgical operation, a change in lifestyle or even a philosophical mindset that helps end a person's sufferings; or the state of being healed, or cured.\n\nA remission is a temporary end to the medical signs and symptoms of an incurable disease. Remissions can be of any length, from days to decades (depending on the disease). A disease is said to be incurable if there is always a chance of the patient relapsing, no matter how long the patient has been in remission. An incurable disease may or may not be a terminal illness; conversely, a curable illness can still result in the patient's death. \n\nThe proportion of people with a disease that are cured by a given treatment, called the cure fraction or cure rate, is determined by comparing disease-free survival of treated people against a matched control group that never had the disease.\n\nAnother way of determining the cure fraction and/or \"cure time\" is by measuring when the hazard rate in a diseased group of individuals returns to the hazard rate measured in the general population.\n\nInherent in the idea of a cure is the permanent end to the specific instance of the disease. When a person has the common cold, and then recovers from it, the person is said to be \"cured\", even though the person might someday catch another cold. Conversely, a person that has successfully managed a disease, such as diabetes mellitus, so that it produces no undesirable symptoms for the moment, but without actually permanently ending it, is not cured.\n\nRelated concepts, whose meaning can differ, include \"response\", \"remission\" and \"recovery\".\n\nIn complex diseases, such as cancer, researchers rely on statistical comparisons of disease-free survival (DFS) of patients against matched, healthy control groups. This logically rigorous approach essentially equates indefinite remission with cure. The comparison is usually made through the Kaplan-Meier estimator approach.\n\nThe simplest cure rate model was published by Berkson and Gage in 1952. In this model, the survival at any given time is equal to those that are cured plus those that are not cured, but who have not yet died or, in the case of diseases that feature asymptomatic remissions, have not yet re-developed signs and symptoms of the disease. When all of the non-cured people have died or re-developed the disease, only the permanently cured members of the population will remain, and the DFS curve will be perfectly flat. The earliest point in time that the curve goes flat is the point at which all remaining disease-free survivors are declared to be permanently cured. If the curve never goes flat, then the disease is formally considered incurable (with the existing treatments).\n\nThe Berkson and Gage equation is \nformula_1\n\nwhere formula_2 is the proportion of people surviving at any given point in time, formula_3 is the proportion that are permanently cured, and formula_4 is an exponential curve that represents the survival of the non-cured people.\n\nCure rate curves can be determined through an analysis of the data. The analysis allows the statistician to determine the proportion of people that are permanently cured by a given treatment, and also how long after treatment it is necessary to wait before declaring an asymptomatic individual to be cured.\n\nSeveral cure rate models exist, such as the expectation-maximization algorithm and Markov chain Monte Carlo model. It is possible to use cure rate models to compare the efficacy of different treatments. Generally, the survival curves are adjusted for the effects of normal aging on mortality, especially when diseases of older people are being studied.\n\nFrom the perspective of the patient, particularly one that has received a new treatment, the statistical model may be frustrating. It may take many years to accumulate sufficient information to determine the point at which the DFS curve flattens (and therefore no more relapses are expected). Some diseases may be discovered to be technically incurable, but also to require treatment so infrequently as to be not materially different from a cure. Other diseases may prove to have a multiple plateaus, so that what was once hailed as a \"cure\" results unexpectedly in very late relapses. Consequently, patients, parents and psychologists developed the notion of psychological cure, or the moment at which the patient decides that the treatment was sufficiently likely to be a cure as to be called a cure. For example, a patient may declare himself to be \"cured\", and to determine to live his life as if the cure were definitely confirmed, immediately after treatment.\n\nRemission is the state of absence of disease activity in patients known to have a chronic illness that cannot be cured. It is commonly used to refer to absence of active cancer or inflammatory bowel disease when these diseases are expected to manifest again in the future. A partial remission may be defined for cancer as 50% or greater reduction in the measurable parameters of tumor growth as may be found on physical examination, radiologic study, or by biomarker levels from a blood or urine test. A complete remission is defined as complete disappearance of all such manifestations of disease. Each disease or even clinical trial can have its own definition of a partial remission.\n\n\nThe most common example of a complete cure is a bacterial infection treated with antibiotics. In 1999, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the World Health Organization established a goal to cure 85% of tuberculosis patients in Russia. They reached an 80% success rate, with 75% of the diseased cured, and 5% that had otherwise successfully finished treatment.\n\n"}

{"id": "48639022", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=48639022", "title": "Dustiness", "text": "Dustiness\n\nDustiness is the tendency of particles to become airborne in response to a mechanical or aerodynamic stimulus. Dustiness is affected by the particle shape, size, and inherent electrostatic forces. Dustiness increases the risk of inhalation exposure.\n\nDusty materials tend to generate aerosols with high particle concentrations measured in number or in mass. The tendency of powdered materials to release airborne particles under external energies indicates their dustiness level.\n\nThe dusty level of powders directly affects worker exposure scenarios and associated health risks in occupational settings. Powder-based aerosol particles can pose advert effects when deposited in human respiratory systems via inhalation.\n\nA significant motivation for quantifying and measuring the dustiness of materials comes from the area of workplace safety. The potential health impacts of suspended particles, particularly by inhalation, can be significant.\n\nThe amount of dust produced during handling or processing of a powder can be affected by the nature of the handling process, the ambient humidity, the particle size and water content of the powder, and other factors. To measure dustiness of a particular powder in a replicable way, standardized testing procedures have been created and published. \n\nVarious laboratory systems have been developed to test dustiness of fine powders. A European standard on dustiness testing has been established by the European Committee for Standardization (CEN) since April 2006. This standard is especially related to human exposure in workplace (EN 15051). It describes two methods: the rotating drum system and continuous drop system, both of which use gravity to stimulate the material and generate aerosols. The rotating drum method involves placing the powder in a cylinder containing baffles, while the continuous drop system involves allowing a stream of powder to fall onto a surface. While the drum approach has been successfully scaled down by some researchers, published standards call for tens or hundreds of grams of material, a stipulation that can prove problematic for nanomaterials, pharmaceuticals and other expensive powders. \n\nRecently, an aerosol generation system based on laboratory funnel (resembling a fluidized bed) has been developed, which has the potential to become an alternative or supplementary method to the existing systems in dustiness testing. Its performance was compared to other three aerosolization systems using the same test materials.\n\nThe dustiness of the nanomaterials can influence potential exposures and the selection of the appropriate engineering control during the manufacturing production. Electrostatic forces influence the stability of particle dispersion in air and effect the dustiness. Nanomaterials in dry powder form tend to pose the greatest risk for inhalation exposure, while nanomaterials suspended in a liquid typically present less risk via inhalation.\n\nThe full life cycle of a nanomaterial should be considered when planning to control for dust exposure. Nanomaterial synthesis reactors, nanoparticle collection and handling, product fabrication with nanomaterials, product use, and product disposal are potential sources of dust exposure. \n\nNational Institute for Occupational Safety and Health recommends the use of high-efficiency particulate air (HEPA) filters on local exhaust ventilation, laboratory chemical hoods, lowflow enclosures, and any other containment enclosures as a best practice during the handling of engineered nanomaterials.\n"}

To this end, the organization distributes explanatory materials and offers economic aid to pregnant women considering abortion.\n\nThe name \"Efrat\" comes from I Chronicles, in which Efrat is the name of Caleb's wife (according to Jewish tradition, she is none other than Miriam). The Midrash Rabbah writes, \"Why was she called Efrat? Because Israel was fruitful (\"paru\") and multiplied through her.\" This refers to her actions against Pharaoh's decree of infanticide, by which she saved the lives of many Israelite children.\n\nEfrat's explanatory materials demonstrate the fetus' qualities of life during the different stages of pregnancy, with the goal of showing that the fetus is a human life. Additionally, the organization presents the medical dangers resulting from abortion, stories of women who had an abortion and later regretted it, and stories of women who planned to have an abortion but ultimately did not.\n\nSince the beginning of the 21st century, the organization has concentrated on providing financial support to pregnant women who plan on having an abortion due to their economic situation.\n\nThe organization's approach is illustrated by the following, quoted from Efrat's website:\n\nWhat is an abortion? Abortion means ending the life of child who is not sufficiently developed to survive outside its mother’s womb.\n\nAlthough the vast majority of abortions are performed on socio-economic grounds, an abortion does not resolve financial or social difficulties. Very often, the psychological scars caused by an abortion only serve to complicate existing problems. Sometimes, it takes women a lifetime to resolve these issues.\n\nEconomic and social problems can be worked out. Situations can - and do - change. But a life can never be restored.\n\nThe organization's main offices are located in Jerusalem, and is led by Dr. Eli J. Schussheim, and, according to the organization's website, has 2,800 volunteers working on the streets in Israel.\n\nAccording to the publications by the organization, in 2006 it prevented the abortion of about 2,600 unborn children, and, in total, has prevented about 25,000 abortions as of 2007.\n\nVarious bodies, among them Mishpacha Hadasha (\"New Family\"), have attacked the organization. The central complaint is that the religious stance of the organization supports the protection of the pregnancy at almost any price and can make both mother and child miserable, such as in cases of teen pregnancies, or pregnancies that involve medical danger.\n\nA law proposed by Knesset Member Reshef Chayne of Shinui attempted to prevent Efrat from providing information to women considering abortion, on the basis he considered it harassment of the pregnant woman. The law was not passed, and certain legalists attacked it.\n\nAnother criticism was that the organization would station women outside offices where abortion permits are issued, with the aim of appealing to women visiting the offices. The Israel Religious Action Center appealed against the rules which regulate the pay grade of those who volunteer for National Service by participating in Efrat's activities, claiming \"infringement of privacy, dignity and freedom of conscience of the women,\" an appeal which was dismissed by the Supreme Court of Israel.\n\nIn 2012, Efrat \"ambassadors\" were criticized for encouraging a pregnant teen not to have an abortion, because the teen couple later attempted suicide.\n\nIn response, Efrat claims that a stance opposing abortion is legitimate, and that in many cases, going through with an abortion will later make the woman miserable. Additionally, the organization claims that it does not coerce women to not perform an abortion, and only provides information. It also wants to ensure that women are not forced into abortions out of economic concerns.\n\n"}

{"id": "306169", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=306169", "title": "Ethylene oxide", "text": "Ethylene oxide\n\nEthylene oxide, called oxirane by IUPAC, is an organic compound with the formula . It is a cyclic ether and the simplest epoxide: a three-membered ring consisting of one oxygen atom and two carbon atoms. Ethylene oxide is a colorless and flammable gas with a faintly sweet odor. Because it is a strained ring, ethylene oxide easily participates in a number of addition reactions that result in ring-opening. Ethylene oxide is isomeric with acetaldehyde and with vinyl alcohol. Ethylene oxide is industrially produced by oxidation of ethylene in the presence of silver catalyst.\n\nThe reactivity that is responsible for many of ethylene oxide's hazards also make it useful. Although too dangerous for direct household use and generally unfamiliar to consumers, ethylene oxide is used for making many consumer products as well as non-consumer chemicals and intermediates. These products include detergents, thickeners, solvents, plastics, and various organic chemicals such as ethylene glycol, ethanolamines, simple and complex glycols, polyglycol ethers, and other compounds. Although it is a vital raw material with diverse applications, including the manufacture of products like polysorbate 20 and polyethylene glycol (PEG) that are often more effective and less toxic than alternative materials, ethylene oxide itself is a very hazardous substance. At room temperature it is a flammable, carcinogenic, mutagenic, irritating, and anaesthetic gas.\n\nAs a toxic gas that leaves no residue on items it contacts, ethylene oxide is a surface disinfectant that is widely used in hospitals and the medical equipment industry to replace steam in the sterilization of heat-sensitive tools and equipment, such as disposable plastic syringes. It is so flammable and extremely explosive that it is used as a main component of thermobaric weapons; therefore, it is commonly handled and shipped as a refrigerated liquid to control its hazardous nature.\n\nEthylene oxide was first reported in 1859 by the French chemist Charles-Adolphe Wurtz, who prepared it by treating 2-chloroethanol with potassium hydroxide:\n\nWurtz measured the boiling point of ethylene oxide as , slightly higher than the present value, and discovered the ability of ethylene oxide to react with acids and salts of metals. Wurtz mistakenly assumed that ethylene oxide has the properties of an organic base. This misconception persisted until 1896 when Georg Bredig found that ethylene oxide is not an electrolyte. That it differed from other ethers — particularly by its propensity to engage in addition reactions, which are typical of unsaturated compounds — had long been a matter of debate. The heterocyclic triangular structure of ethylene oxide was proposed by 1868 or earlier.\n\nWurtz's 1859 synthesis long remained the only method of preparing ethylene oxide, despite numerous attempts, including by Wurtz himself, to produce ethylene oxide directly from ethylene. Only in 1931 did French chemist Theodore Lefort develop a method of direct oxidation of ethylene in the presence of silver catalyst. Since 1940, almost all industrial production of ethylene oxide has relied on this process. Sterilization by ethylene oxide for the preservation of spices was patented in 1938 by the American chemist Lloyd Hall. Ethylene oxide achieved industrial importance during World War I as a precursor to both the coolant ethylene glycol and the chemical weapon mustard gas.\n\nThe epoxy cycle of ethylene oxide is an almost regular triangle with bond angles of about 60° and a significant angular strain corresponding to the energy of 105 kJ/mol. For comparison, in alcohols the C–O–H angle is about 110°; in ethers, the C–O–C angle is 120°. The moment of inertia about each of the principal axes are \"I\" = 32.921×10 g·cm, \"I\" = 37.926×10 g·cm and \"I\" = 59.510×10 g·cm.\n\nThe relative instability of the carbon-oxygen bonds in the molecule is revealed by the comparison in the table of the energy required to break two C–O bonds in the ethylene oxide or one C–O bond in ethanol and dimethyl ether:\nThis instability correlates with its high reactivity, explaining the ease of its ring-opening reactions (see Chemical properties).\n\nEthylene oxide is a colorless gas at and is a mobile liquid at – viscosity of liquid ethylene oxide at 0 °C is about 5.5 times lower than that of water. The gas has a characteristic sweet odor of ether, noticeable when its concentration in air exceeds 500ppm. Ethylene oxide is readily soluble in water, ethanol, diethyl ether and many organic solvents.\n\nMain thermodynamical constants are:\n\nBetween , vapor pressure \"p\" (in mmHg) varies with temperature (\"T\" in °C) as \n<nowiki>*</nowiki>N/A – data not available.\n<nowiki>*</nowiki>N/A – data not available.\n\nEthylene oxide readily reacts with diverse compounds with opening of the ring. Its typical reactions are with nucleophiles which proceed via the S2 mechanism both in acidic (weak nucleophiles: water, alcohols) and alkaline media (strong nucleophiles: OH, RO, NH, RNH, RR'NH, etc.). The general reaction scheme is\n\nand more specific reactions are described below.\n\nAqueous solutions of ethylene oxide are rather stable and can exist for a long time without any noticeable chemical reaction, but adding a small amount of acid, such as strongly diluted sulfuric acid, immediately leads to the formation of ethylene glycol, even at room temperature:\n\nThe reaction also occurs in the gas phase, in the presence of a phosphoric acid salt as a catalyst.\n\nThe reaction is usually carried out at about with a large excess of water, in order to prevent the reaction of the formed ethylene glycol with ethylene oxide that would form di- and triethylene glycol:\n\nThe use of alkaline catalysts may lead to the formation of polyethylene glycol:\n\nReactions with alcohols proceed similarly yielding ethylene glycol ethers:\n\nReactions with lower alcohols occur less actively than with water and require more severe conditions, such as heating to and pressurizing to and adding an acid or alkali catalyst.\n\nReactions of ethylene oxide with fatty alcohols proceed in the presence of sodium metal, sodium hydroxide or boron trifluoride and are used for the synthesis of surfactants.\n\nReactions of ethylene oxide with carboxylic acids in the presence of a catalyst results in glycol mono- and diesters:\n\nThe addition of acid amides proceeds similarly:\n\nAddition of ethylene oxide to higher carboxylic acids is carried out at elevated temperatures (typically ) and pressure () in an inert atmosphere, in presence of an alkaline catalyst (concentration 0.01–2%), such as hydroxide or carbonate of sodium or potassium. The carboxylate ion acts as nucleophile in the reaction:\n\nEthylene oxide reacts with ammonia forming a mixture of mono-, di- and tri- ethanolamines. The reaction is stimulated by adding a small amount of water.\n\nSimilarly proceed the reactions with primary and secondary amines:\n\nDialkylamino ethanols can further react with ethylene oxide, forming amino polyethylene glycols:\n\nTrimethylamine reacts with ethylene oxide in the presence of water, forming choline:\n\nAromatic primary and secondary amines also react with ethylene oxide, forming the corresponding arylamino alcohols.\n\nEthylene oxide readily reacts with aqueous solutions of hydrochloric, hydrobromic and hydroiodic acids to form halohydrins. The reaction occurs easier with the last two acids:\n\nThe reaction with these acids competes with the acid-catalyzed hydration of ethylene oxide; therefore, there is always a by-product of ethylene glycol with an admixture of diethylene glycol. For a cleaner product, the reaction is conducted in the gas phase or in an organic solvent.\n\nEthylene fluorohydrin is obtained differently, by boiling hydrogen fluoride with a 5–6% solution of ethylene oxide in diethyl ether. The ether normally has a water content of 1.5–2%; in absence of water, ethylene oxide polymerizes.\n\nHalohydrins can also be obtained by passing ethylene oxide through aqueous solutions of metal halides:\n\nInteraction of ethylene oxide with organomagnesium compounds, which are Grignard reagents, can be regarded as nucleophilic substitution influenced by carbanion organometallic compounds. The final product of the reaction is a primary alcohol:\n\n\\overset{primary~alcohol}{R-CH2CH2-OH}</chem>\n\nSimilar mechanism is valid for other organometallic compounds, such as alkyl lithium:\n\nEthylene oxide easily reacts with the hydrogen cyanide forming ethylene cyanohydrin:\n\nA slightly chilled (10–20 °C) aqueous solution of calcium cyanide can be used instead of HCN:\n\nEthylene cyanohydrin easily loses water, producing acrylonitrile:\n\nWhen reacting with the hydrogen sulfide, ethylene oxide forms 2-mercaptoethanol and thiodiglycol, and with alkylmercaptans it produces 2-alkyl mercaptoetanol:\n\nThe excess of ethylene oxide with an aqueous solution of hydrogen sulfide leads to the tris-(hydroxyethyl) sulfonyl hydroxide:\n\nReaction of ethylene oxide with aqueous solutions of barium nitrite, calcium nitrite, magnesium nitrite, zinc nitrite or sodium nitrite leads to the formation of 2-nitroethanol:\n\nWith nitric acid, ethylene oxide forms mono- and dinitroglycols:\n\nIn the presence of alkoxides, reactions of ethylene oxide with compounds containing active methylene group leads to the formation of butyrolactones:\n\nEthylene oxide enters into the Friedel–Crafts reaction with benzene to form phenethyl alcohol:\n\nStyrene can be obtained in one stage if this reaction is conducted at elevated temperatures () and pressures (), in presence of an aluminosilicate catalyst.\n\nA series of polynomial heterocyclic compounds, known as crown ethers, can be synthesized with ethylene oxide. One method is the cationic cyclopolymerization of ethylene oxide, limiting the size of the formed cycle:\n\nTo suppress the formation of other linear polymers the reaction is carried out in a highly dilute solution.\n\nReaction of ethylene oxide with sulfur dioxide in the presence of caesium salts leads to the formation of an 11-membered heterocyclic compound which has the complexing properties of crown ethers:\n\nWhen heated to about , or to in the presence of a catalyst (AlO, HPO, etc.), ethylene oxide isomerizes into acetaldehyde:\n\nThe radical mechanism was proposed to explain this reaction in the gas phase; it comprises the following stages:\n\nIn reaction (), M refers to the wall of the reaction vessel or to a heterogeneous catalyst.\nThe moiety CHCHO* represents a short-lived (lifetime of 10 seconds), activated molecule of acetaldehyde. Its excess energy is about 355.6 kJ/mol, which exceeds by 29.3 kJ/mol the binding energy of the C-C bond in acetaldehyde.\n\nIn absence of a catalyst, the thermal isomerization of ethylene oxide is never selective and apart from acetaldehyde yields significant amount of by-products (see section Thermal decomposition).\n\nEthylene oxide can be hydrogenated into ethanol in the presence of a catalyst, such as nickel, platinum, palladium, boranes, lithium aluminium hydride and some other hydrides.\n\nConversely, with some other catalysts, ethylene oxide may be \"reduced\" by hydrogen to ethylene with the yield up to 70%. The reduction catalysts include mixtures of zinc dust and acetic acid, of lithium aluminium hydride with titanium trichloride (the reducing agent is actually titanium dichloride, formed by the reaction between LiAlH and TiCl) and of iron(III) chloride with butyllithium in tetrahydrofuran.\n"}
{"id": "24366977", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=24366977", "title": "Food presentation", "text": "Food presentation\n\nFood presentation is the art of modifying, processing, arranging, or decorating food to enhance its aesthetic appeal.\n\nThe visual presentation of foods is often considered by chefs at many different stages of food preparation, from the manner of tying or sewing meats, to the type of cut used in chopping and slicing meats or vegetables, to the style of mold used in a poured dish. The food itself may be decorated as in elaborately iced cakes, topped with ornamental sometimes sculptural consumables, drizzled with sauces, sprinkled with seeds, powders, or other toppings, or it may be accompanied by edible or inedible garnishes.\n\nHistorically, the presentation of food has been used as a show of wealth and power. Such displays often emphasize the complexity of a dish's composition as opposed to its flavors. For instance, ancient sources recall the hosts of Roman banquets adding precious metals and minerals to food in order to enhance its aesthetic appeal. Additionally, Medieval aristocrats hosted feasts involving sculptural dishes and shows of live animals. These banquets existed to show the culture and affluence of its host, and were therefore tied to social class. Contemporary food aesthetics reflect the autonomy of the chef, such as in nouvelle cuisine and Japanese bento boxes. Dishes often involve both simplistic and complex designs. Some schools of thought, like French nouvelle cuisine, emphasize minimalism while others create complicated compositions based on modern aesthetic principles. Overall, the presentation of food reflects societal trends and beliefs.\n\nThe arrangement and overall styling of food upon bringing it to the plate is termed plating. Some common styles of plating include a 'classic' arrangement of the main item in the front of the plate with vegetables or starches in the back, a 'stacked' arrangement of the various items, or the main item leaning or 'shingled' upon a vegetable bed or side item. Item location on the plate is often referenced as for the face of a clock, with six o'clock the position closest to the diner. A basic rule of thumb upon plating, and even in some cases prepping, is to make sure you have the 5 components to a dish; protein, traditionally at a 6 o'clock position, vegetable, at a 2 o'clock position, starch at an 11 o'clock position, sauce and garnish.\n\nBanquets were important social events, usually hosted in private residences for friends and clients. The Romans placed great focus on the appearance of their dining room (triclinium), decorating it with murals and mosaics, as well as lavish sculptures and furniture. The overall purpose of a private banquet was entertainment, not only through live performances, but also through the presentation of the food itself. The meal consisted of three courses- appetizers, main course, and dessert- brought out in elaborate rituals. For instance, the main course was sometimes served to the tune of trumpets at particularly luxurious events. Foods that were particularly valued were wild game, such as pheasant and boar, certain kinds of fish, and wild berries, mainly because of their exoticism and high price. Some ancient writers recount Emperor Claudius adding crushed pearls to wine and flecks of gold to peas solely to increase their cost. Others recall live animals being served as shows of entertainment and richness. For instance, at one event mackerels were pickled live in order to showcase their silvery bodies thrashing in vinegar. Overall, Roman aristocrats desired to showcase their wealth and luxury through the presentation of food.\n\nMedieval aristocrats also desired to entertain and impress through food. Banquets were usually huge feasts with diverse choices of dishes. Social etiquette dictated that the wealthy and powerful be given beautiful and elaborate dishes while the poor be given simple food, usually scraps. Such banquets not only entertained guests, but also showed the wealth of the host. In particular, the patron sometimes commissioned artists to create complicated sculptures made from food items to awe and inspire. A popular sculpture was a pregnant woman modeled in marzipan or sugar paste. Other favorites were pies or cakes designed to expel live birds when cut open and multicolored jellies stacked together, dyed with spices and vegetable matter. Furthermore, since these foods often were not preserved properly and were somewhat rotted when stored, the stench of decaying food was covered with spices and other aromas. This indicates the medieval hosts concern with presentation as opposed to flavor.\n\nIn the same way, contemporary food reflects both personal and societal aesthetic beliefs. While cuisine in the past was intrinsically related to wealth and social status, contemporary cuisine is much less distinguished by class. The disintegration of highbrow and lowbrow foods has led to increased accessibility of various foods. Now, it is possible to find a hamburger at a five star restaurants and exotic cuisines on street corners. Therefore, contemporary food presentation is determined much more by modern aesthetics and creativity than displays of wealth and power.\n\nNouvelle cuisine is a school of French cooking that rejects ostentatious displays of food in favor of simple presentation and high-quality ingredients. In contrast to historical chefs that obeyed the orders of patrons, this manner of cooking elevates the chef from a skilled worker to an inventor and artist. The aesthetic of nouvelle cuisine emphasizes minimalism, serving fewer courses and utilizing simple plating. Chefs were extremely creative in constructing innovative recipes and plating.\n\nA bento box is a Japanese meal traditionally consisting of rice, meat/fish, and vegetables served in a portable box. In Japan, as well as in the United States, a large focus is placed on the aesthetic arrangement of the food. There have even been contests to see who can come up with the most inventive way of creating bento boxes, allowing for creativity in amateur chefs and everyday people. Sometimes bento boxes are used to make sculptural designs, such as rice shaped to look like animals. These specific types of bento boxes are known as Kyaraben or charaben, \"(\"キャラ弁\")\" a shortened form of character bento. \"(\"キャラクター弁当 \"kyarakutā bentō)\" Kyaraben are most often made by mothers to encourage their children to eat more nutritious diets and as a way of showing their love and dedication.\n\nKaiseki (懐石) is a Japanese multi-course haute cuisine dinner consisting of 7-14 courses, often served at \"ryokan\", but also in small restaurants known as \"ryōtei\", particularly in Kyoto. A large focus of kaiseki is in the elaborate preparation and aesthetic presentation of these meals to enhance the natural flavors of fresh, local ingredients. Meals are often garnished with edible leaves and flowers to enhance the seasonality of the meal and its ingredients and are arranged to resemble natural plants and animals.\n\nKaiseki dinners most commonly involve an appetizer, sashimi, a simmered dish, a grilled dish, and a steamed dish. Other dishes may be added or omitted depending on the chef.\n\nModern science can illuminate how and why people respond in certain ways to food plating and presentation. According to a sociological study, people react differently to various aesthetic principles such as color, composition (including a number of components, placement of components, and use of negative space), design, and the organization of a plate. They found that participants responded best to plates with four different colors, three different components, some empty space, and with a disorganized and casual design. This research is particularly important because understanding how food presentation affects how people eat can be used in the study of health and nutrition. For instance, another study showed that participants who ate off of uncleaned tables (i.e. all uneaten food was left on the table) ate less than those that had their tabled periodically cleaned. This is presumably because those that could see the leftovers of what they had eaten were less likely to take more food. This could be useful, for instance, in combatting the obesity endemic. Another example of science in food aesthetics is the development of molecular food in Spain, which emphasizes the essence of food using scientific elements. Molecular science can break down the roles of carbohydrates and protein in order to isolate what creates particular tastes. For instance, modern science makes it possible to freeze ice cream using liquid nitrogen and create wine using sugars, creating efficient and visually interesting new dishes.\n\nLike other aspects of culture, food presentation is subject to trends and fads. For instance, \"unicorn food\", a style of presentation that uses a rainbow color palette to decorate food, became popular in 2017. The pastel-like hues are supposed to represent the colors of the mythical unicorn.\n\n"}
{"id": "6332750", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=6332750", "title": "Grosse Isle, Quebec", "text": "Grosse Isle, Quebec\n\nGrosse Isle (, \"big island\"), is located in Gulf of St. Lawrence in Quebec, Canada. It is one of the islands of the 21-island Isle-aux-Grues archipelago. It is part of the municipality of Saint-Antoine-de-l'Isle-aux-Grues, located in the Chaudière-Appalaches region of the province.\n\nAlso known as Grosse Isle and the Irish Memorial National Historic Site, the island was the site of an immigration depot which predominantly housed Irish immigrants coming to Canada to escape the Great Famine, 1845-1849. In 1832, the Lower Canadian Government had previously set up this depot to contain an earlier cholera epidemic that was believed to be caused by the large influx of European immigrants, and the station was reopened in the mid-Nineteenth Century to accommodate Irish migrants who had contracted typhus during their voyages. Thousands of Irish were quarantined on Grosse Isle from 1832 to 1848.\n\nIt is believed that over 3000 Irish died on the island and over 5000 are currently buried in the cemetery there; many died en route. Most who died on the island were infected with typhus, which sprang up from the conditions there in 1847. Grosse Isle is the largest burial ground for refugees of the Great Famine outside Ireland. After Canadian Confederation in 1867, the buildings and equipment were modernized to meet the standards of the new Canadian government's immigration policies. The island is sometimes called Canada's Ellis Island (1892-1954), an association it shares with Pier 21 immigration facility in Halifax, Nova Scotia.\n\nIt is estimated that in total, from when it was set up in 1832 to the closing in 1932, almost 500,000 Irish immigrants passed through Grosse Isle on their way to Canada.\n\nOn arrival at Grosse Isle, emigrant ships were not permitted to sail onwards unless they had assured the authorities that they were free of disease. Those with fever cases on board were required to fly a blue flag. Dr. George Douglas, Grosse Isle's chief medical officer, recorded that by mid-summer the quarantine regulations in force were 'physically impossible' to carry out, making it necessary for the emigrants to stay on board their ships for many days. Douglas believed that washing and airing out the ships would be enough to stop the contagion spreading between infected passengers.\n\nRobert Whyte, pseudonymous author of the \"1847 Famine Ship Diary: The Journey of a Coffin Ship\", described how on arrival at Grosse Isle the Irish emigrant passengers on the \"Ajax\" dressed in their best clothes and helped the crew to clean the ship, expecting to be sent either to hospital or on to Quebec after their long voyage. In fact, the doctor inspected them only briefly and did not return for several days. By mid-summer doctors were examining their charges very perfunctorily, allowing them to walk past and examining the tongues of any who looked feverish. In this way, many people with latent fever were allowed to pass as healthy, only to succumb to their sickness once they had left Grosse Isle.\n\nOn 28 July 1847, Whyte recorded the neglect of his fellow passengers, who 'within reach of help' 'were to be left enveloped in reeking pestilence, the sick without medicine, medical skill, nourishment, or so much as a drop of pure water'. However, conditions on other Irish emigrant ships were still worse. Two Canadian priests who visited the \"Ajax\" described the holds of other vessels where they had been 'up to their ankles in filth. The wretched emigrants crowded together like cattle and corpses remain[ed] long unburied'. Whyte contrasted this with the condition of German immigrants arriving at Grosse Isle. These were all free of sickness, 'comfortably and neatly clad, clean and happy'. \"The Times\" also commented on the 'healthy, robust and cheerful' Germans.\n\nThe exact numbers of those who died at sea is unknown, although Whyte himself estimated it at 5293. During the crossing itself, bodies were thrown into the sea, but once the ships had reached Grosse Isle they were kept in the hold until a burial on land became possible. The dead were dragged out of the holds with hooks and 'stacked like cordwood' on the shore. On July 29, 1847 Whyte described 'a continuous line of boats, each carrying its freight of dead to the burial ground... Some had several corpses so tied up in canvas that the stiff, sharp outline of death was easily traceable'.\n\nEven those passengers who escaped typhus and other diseases were weakened by the journey. The Senate Committee of the United States on Sickness and Mortality in Emigrant Ships described the newly disembarked emigrants as 'cadaverous' and 'feeble'. Most had been misled by passage-brokers into believing that they would be provided with food on the ship.\n\nBefore the 1847 crisis, invalids were placed in hospitals while the healthy carried out their quarantine periods in sheds. However, in 1847 the island was quickly overwhelmed. Tents were set up to house the influx of people, but many new arrivals were left lying on the ground without shelter. Robert Whyte records seeing 'hundreds... literally flung on the beach, left amid the mud and stones to crawl on the dry land as they could'. The Anglican Bishop of Montreal, Bishop Mountain, recalled seeing people lying opposite the church screaming for water, while others lay inside the tents without bedding. One child he saw was covered in vermin; another who had 'been walking with some others, sat down for a moment, and died'. Many children were orphaned.\n\nAccommodation was found in the sheds, which were filthy and crowded, with patients lying in double tiers of bunks which allowed dirt from the top bunk to fall onto the lower. According to the Senate Committee's report, two or three invalids would be placed together in one berth, irrespective of age or sex. There was no bread: meals consisted of tea, gruel or broth served three times a day. As drinking water was carted, there was never enough for the fever patients. One Catholic priest, Father Moylan, reported giving water to invalids in a tent who had not been able to drink for 18 hours. The sheds were not originally intended to house fever patients and had no ventilation; new sheds were built without privies. The Senate Committee stated that because of the lack of personnel and space, the invalids lay in their own excrement for days and there were insufficient staff to take away those who died during the night. The hospitals themselves had very little equipment and planks for bedding were not always available, meaning that it was spread on the ground and became soaked.\n\nAt Quebec, the French and English speaking Catholic clergy ministered to the discharged emigrants and convalescents brought from the island. Father McMahon, founder of St. Patrick's Church (Quebec City), took a leading part in organizing relief to the sufferers and orphans of that awful period.\n\nAs well as a shortage of accommodation, there was a serious lack of medical personnel to care for the sick. Dr. Douglas attempted to enlist nurses from among the healthy female passengers with the promise of high wages, but fear of disease meant none accepted. Nurses were expected to sleep alongside the sick and share their food; they had no privacy, often caught the fever themselves and were not helped when they fell ill. Prisoners from the local jail were released to carry out the nursing, but many stole from the dead and the dying. All of the medical officers involved became ill at some stage, with four doctors dying of typhus. Under the Passenger Act of 1842, ships were not obliged to carry a doctor, and only two doctors arrived as passengers. One of these was a Dr. Benson from Dublin, a man with experience working in fever hospitals in Ireland. He arrived on May 21, volunteered to help the sick, contracted typhus himself and was dead within six days.\n\nMore than forty Irish and French Canadian priests and Anglican clergymen were active on Grosse Isle, many becoming ill themselves. The Chief Pastor, Bishop Power, contracted fever and died after delivering the last sacraments to a dying woman in September. The Mayor of Montreal, John Easton Mills, also died in the course of caring for the sick.\n\nMany immigrants who passed the perfunctory quarantine checks at Grosse Isle fell sick soon afterwards. Some died in the camp for the 'healthy', tents on the eastern side of Grosse Isle. When a priest, Father O'Reilly, visited this area in August, he gave the last rites to fifty people. In the week leading up to August 18 alone, 88 deaths occurred among the 'healthy'.\n\nOn June 8, Dr. Douglas warned the authorities of Quebec and Montreal that an epidemic was about to strike. On the previous Sunday between 4,000 and 5,000 'healthy' had left Grosse Isle, of whom Dr. Douglas estimated two thousand would develop fever within three weeks. Thousands were being discharged into Montreal, weak and helpless, some crawling because they could not walk, others 'lying on the wharves, dying'. Immigrants in Quebec were described as 'emaciated objects' huddled 'in the doors of churches, the wharves and the streets, apparently in the last stages of disease and famine'.\n\nFrom 1847 to 1848, an estimated 3,000 to 6,000 Irish died from ship fever in fever sheds set up at Windmill Point in Montreal. Their remains were discovered in 1859 by workers building the Victoria Bridge, who erected the Black Rock memorial in their honour. Its inscription reads:\n\nOther cities, including Kingston and Toronto, were anxious to push immigrants on. Whyte recorded seeing one family sheltering under boards by the side of the road and commented that 'there is no means of learning how many of the survivors of so many ordeals were cut off by the inclemency of a Canadian winter'.\n\nOne immigrant who did survive was the grandfather of Henry Ford, founder of the Ford Motor Company.\n\nA national memorial, the Celtic Cross, was unveiled on site on August 15, 1909. Designed by Jeremiah O'Gallagher, Country President of the Ancient Order of Hibernians at the time, the monument is the largest of its kind in North America. In 1974, the government of Canada declared the island a National Historic Site. A memorial was erected on the island in 1997.\n\nThis timeline has been derived from Cecil Woodham-Smith's work \"The Great Hunger: Ireland 1845-1849\", first published by Hamish Hamilton in 1962.\n\nOn February 19, the medical officer in charge of the quarantine station at Grosse Isle, Dr George M. Douglas, requested £3,000 to assist with an expected influx of Irish immigrants. He was granted £300, a small steamer and permission to hire a sailing vessel for not more than £50.\n\nQuebec citizens petitioned Earl Grey, Secretary of State for the Colonies, to take action in the face of the expected rise in immigration.\n\nThe Colonial Land and Emigration Commissioners published their seventh report without any mention of the approaching crisis.\n\nChief Emigration Officer Alexander Carlisle Buchanan failed to report concerns to the Canadian government because it was \"not within the control of [his] department\".\n\nDr. Douglas, believing 10,600 emigrants had left Britain for Quebec since April 10, requested £150 for a new fever shed. The authorities promised him £135. Preparations were made for 200 invalids.\n\nOn May 17 the first vessel, the \"Syria\", arrived with 430 fever cases. This was followed by eight more ships a few days later. Dr Douglas wrote that he had 'not a bed to lay [the invalids] on... I never contemplated the possibility of every vessel arriving with fever as they do now'. One week later seventeen more vessels had appeared at Grosse Isle. By this time, 695 people were already in hospital. Only two days afterwards the number of vessels reached thirty, with 10,000 immigrants now waiting to be processed. By May 29, a total of 36 vessels had arrived. The end of May saw forty ships forming a line two miles (3 km) long down the St. Lawrence River. According to Dr Douglas, each one was affected by fever and dysentery. 1100 invalids were accommodated in sheds and tents, or laid out in rows in the church.\n\nDue to the lack of space on Grosse Isle, Dr. Douglas required healthy passengers to stay on ship for fifteen days once the sick had been removed, by way of quarantine. Infection flourished on board the ships. One ship, the \"Agnes\", reached Grosse Isle with 427 passengers of whom only 150 survived the quarantine period.\n\nOn June 1, the Catholic archbishop of Quebec contacted all Catholic bishops and archbishops in Ireland, asking them to discourage their diocesans from emigrating. Despite this, of the 109,000 emigrants who had left for British North America, almost all were Irish.\n\nOn June 5, 25,000 Irish immigrants were quarantined on Grosse Isle itself or waiting in the ships anchored nearby.\n\nBy mid-summer 2500 invalids were quarantined on Grosse Isle, and the line of waiting ships stretched several miles. At the end of the month, Dr. Douglas abandoned the quarantine regulations because they were 'impossible' to enforce. His new instructions were that the healthy would be released after a cursory check by the doctor.\n\nIce blocks the St. Lawrence and immigration ceases.\n\nThis information was taken from \"Île of Irish Tears\", an article appearing in the \"Toronto Star\" on 2 May 1992.\n\n1862: A total of 59 casualties die on the island, 34 from typhus. Medical improvements, the abandonment of slow-sailing ships in favour of steam ships and tougher quarantine regulations helped slow the spread of disease.\n\n1870 - 1880: Only 42 deaths are reported on Grosse Isle during this decade.\n\n1880 - 1932: Grosse Isle continues to act as a quarantine station against typhus, cholera, beriberi, smallpox and bubonic plague.\n\n1909: The Ancient Order of Hibernians in America set up a Celtic cross with inscriptions in Irish, English and French, in memory of those who died during 1847 and 1848.\n\n1932: Grosse Isle ceases to be a quarantine station. By this time, immigrants are arriving at many different ports and the city hospitals are capable of dealing with them.\n\n1939 - 1945 (approx): Used by the Department of National Defence to research bacteriological warfare, including the manufacture of anthrax.\n\n1956: Taken over by Agriculture Canada for quarantining animals.\n\n1974: Declared a National Historic Site by the Canadian government.\n\n1993: Grosse Isle becomes a national historic park operated by Parks Canada.\n\n1997: A memorial is erected in memory of those who died on the island.\n\nVisitors can tour many of the buildings used for the immigrants and by the islanders. The disinfection building features the original showers, waiting rooms and steam disinfection apparatus, as well as a multimedia exhibit about the island's history. A walking trail or trolley are available for visits of the village and hospital sector, including the 1847 lazaretto (quarantine station), Catholic chapel, Anglican chapel, the superintendent’s gardens, the eastern wharf and a transport museum. In season, costumed interpreters portray various islanders, such as the quarantine station's staff, the nurse, Catholic priest, carter and school teacher.\n\nThe lazaretto features an exhibit about the tragic experiences of the immigrants in 1847.\n\nA walking trail leads to the Celtic cross and the Irish Memorial, which honours the memory of the immigrants, the employees of the quarantine station, the sailors, the doctors and the priests who perished on this island.\n\nGrosse Île and the Irish Memorial National Historic Site were twinned on May 25, 1998, with the Famine Museum in Strokestown, Ireland.\n\n\n\n"}

The Portuguese healthcare system was ranked number 12 in overall performance by the World Health Organization in a 2000 report ranking the healthcare systems of each of the 190 United Nations member nations. Nonetheless it ranked number 27 as the most expensive per capita healthcare system.\n\nSimilar to the other Eur-A countries, most Portuguese die from noncommunicable diseases. Mortality from cardiovascular diseases (CVD) is higher than in the Eurozone, but its two main components, ischaemic heart disease and cerebrovascular disease, display inverse trends compared with the Eur-A, with cerebrovascular disease being the single biggest killer in Portugal (17%).\nPortuguese people die 12% less often from cancer than in the Eur-A, but mortality is not declining as rapidly as in the Eur-A. Cancer is more frequent among children as well as among women younger than 44 years. Although lung cancer (slowly increasing among women) and breast cancer (decreasing rapidly) are scarcer, cancer of the cervix and the prostate are more frequent.\nPortugal has the highest mortality rate for diabetes in the Eur-A, with a sharp increase since the late 1980s.\n\nPortugal’s infant mortality rate has dropped sharply since the 1980s, when 24 of 1000 newborns died in the first year of life. It is now around 3 deaths per a 1000 newborns. This improvement was mainly due to the decrease in neonatal mortality, from 15.5 to 3.4 per 1000 live births.\n\nPeople are usually well informed about their health status, the positive and negative effects of their behaviour on their health and their use of health care services. Yet their perceptions of their health can differ from what administrative and examination-based data show about levels of illness within populations. Thus, survey results based on self-reporting at the household level complement other data on health status and the use of services.\nOnly one third of adults rated their health as good or very good in Portugal (Kasmel et al., 2004). This is the lowest of the Eur-A countries reporting and reflects the relatively adverse situation of the country in terms of mortality and selected morbidity.\n\nIn 2015 it was estimated that 13.09% of the population has diabetes, costing about $2,011 per person per year.\n\nMadeira had the third highest death rate from respiratory diseases of any region in Europe in 2015 at 151 per 100,000 population.\n\n"}

They can be expected, on average, to be healthier as they are concerned for their health and are predisposed to follow medical advice, both factors that would aid one's health. In a sense, being healthy or active about one's health is a precondition for becoming a subject of the study, an effect that can appear under other conditions such as studying particular groups of workers (i.e. someone in ill health is unlikely to have a job as manual laborer).\n\n\n"}
{"id": "51243485", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=51243485", "title": "High-grade serous carcinoma", "text": "High-grade serous carcinoma\n\nHigh-grade serous carcinoma (HGSC) is a type of tumour that arises from the serous epithelial layer in the abdominopelvic cavity and is mainly found in the ovary. HGSCs make up the majority of ovarian cancer cases and have the lowest survival rates.\nHGSC is distinct from low-grade serous carcinoma (LGSC) which arises from ovarian tissue, is less aggressive and is present in stage I ovarian cancer where tumours are localised to the ovary.\n\nAlthough originally thought to arise from the squamous epithelial cell layer covering the ovary, HGSC is now thought to originate in the Fallopian tube epithelium. HGSC is much more invasive than LGSC with a higher fatality rate - although it is more sensitive to platinum-based chemotherapy, possibly due to its rapid growth rate. In rare cases, HGSCs can develop from LGSCs, but generally the two types arise independently of each other.\n\nThe ‘incessant ovulation’ theory is suggested by the strong correlation between the number of ovulatory cycles of an individual and their risk of ovarian cancer.\n\nThis trend is reflected in the protective effects of pregnancy, parity and breastfeeding against ovarian cancer, and similar findings in epidemiological studies that have indicated a reduction of risk associated with use of oral contraceptive pills.\n\nOvulation is accepted as the cause of ovarian cortical inclusion cysts, the precursor lesions of serous carcinomas, and lower numbers of these cortical inclusion cysts are thought to be the mechanism by which reducing lifetime ovulations can lower the risk of developing HGSC.\n\nConversely, a temporal association with menopausal hormone therapy and incidence of HGSC was found, and polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS) was shown to contribute to a doubling of the risk of ovarian cancer.\n\nEndometriosis can increase risk for other ovarian cancer subtypes, but is not associated with HGSC.\n\nMore than 20% of ovarian cancer tumours have hereditary origin. The majority of these feature mutations in the tumour suppressor BRCA genes, which tend to give rise to HGSC. A mutation in BRCA1 or BRCA2 can confer a lifetime ovarian cancer risk of 40-50% and 10-20% respectively, with BRCA2 mutations strongly associated with better clinical outcomes.\n\nA specific tumour protein 53 (\"TP53)\" expression pattern in the Fallopian tube epithelium – the ‘p53 signature’ - is thought to be a precursor marker of HGSC. TP53-/- mice (in which the TP53 gene has been deleted) do not develop ovarian carcinomas. However, TP53 mutations were found in 96% of HGSC cases. A local abnormal TP53 expression may thus be indicative of HGSC. In women, pelvic HGSC show either a complete absence of P53 expression, or overexpression, suggesting that any aberration of P53 leads to tumour development. Additionally, overexpression of TP53 is associated with better clinical outcome whereas an absence of the p53 protein is linked to an increased risk of HGSC tumour recurrence.\n\nA recent mouse model suggest that a p53 mutation may induce HGSC arising from the ovary rather than the Fallopian tube.\n\nHGSC are further distinguished from LGSC by ‘type I/II’ ovarian tumour nomenclature; type I referring to tumour types (e.g. LGSCs) where precursor lesions within the ovary have been characterised, and type II referring to tumour types (e.g. HGSCs) without association of such lesions, tumours understood to develop \"de novo\" from the tubal and/or ovarian surface epithelium. This classification has more relevance to research rather than to clinical practice.\n\nThe serous membrane is a particular type of secretory epithelium which covers organs in body cavities and secretes serous fluid to reduce friction from muscle movement. Serous membrane lining the abdominopelvic cavity is called the peritoneum; that lining heart and mediastinum is the pericardium, and that lining the thoracic cavity and lungs is the pleura. Technically a ‘serous carcinoma’ can occur anywhere on these membranes, but high-grade serous carcinoma is generally limited to the peritoneal area.\n\nWhile until recently HGSC was thought to arise from simple differentiation of cortical inclusion cysts (CICs) of ovarian surface epithelium (OSE), the cell origin of HGSC is now understood to be much more complex, with evidence for other sites of origin, both intra- and extra-ovarian, having come to light.\n\nThe common Müllerian origin of the Fallopian tubes, uterus, cervix, and upper vagina has resulted in the proposal that peritoneal high-grade serous carcinoma is a spectrum of a single disease.\n\nRelevant animal models of HGSC can only be developed when the cell origin is properly understood. However, as HGSC tends to have the same clinical behaviour, regardless of its primary cell origin, determining cell origin is less important for clinical treatment, but may be of relevance when looking for biomarkers.\n\nThe specific process by which a HGSC arises may be related to the BRCA mutation status of the individual, as well as the p53 mutation status.\n\nA 2007 paper describes the process of determining cell of origin as “Tumour origin is typically assigned to the organ presenting with the dominant tumour mass. The one exception is the peritoneum, which is classified as a primary site only if a candidate origin is not found in the endometrium, tube or ovary”.\n\nIt is recognised that HGSC can have variable and complex primary origins, but understanding and determining this will give insight into its pathogenesis. \nAssuming a fimbrial origin, as observed in the majority of HGSC cases, the current understanding of HGSC genesis suggests a process by which STIC fimbrial cells implant into the ovary as cortical inclusion cysts through the ovulation rupture site.\n\nTo account for instances where there is no STIC involvement, endosalpingiosis or \"de novo\" metaplasia of ovarian surface epithelium inclusions are also possible. A much rarer occurrence is the differentiation of HGSC from LGSC.\n\nSymptoms include persistent bloating, postmenopausal bleeding, and/or appetite loss.\n\nTransvaginal ultrasonography as well as cancer marker CA125 level analysis is often used to determine potential malignancy of suspect pelvic masses.\n\nSurgical staging is the procedure by which the abdominal cavity and lymph nodes are examined for malignant tissue, usually via laparoscopy. Tissue biopsies may be taken for further analysis. It is not until this histological analysis stage that actual diagnosis of HGSC can be made.\n\nIf glands are seen to fuse with intricate, extensive papillae featuring epithelial tufting with solid nests surrounded by a space alongside irregular slit-like spaces, then serous carcinoma is suspected.\n\nDistinguishing between LGSC and HGSC:\nDistinction of HGSC from high-grade endometrioid carcinoma is not always possible.\n\nThe progression of HGSC may also be determined from examining the cadherin expression profile.\n\nAs ovarian cancer is rarely symptomatic until an advanced stage, regular pre-emptive screening is a particularly important tool for avoiding the late stage at which most patients present. However, A 2011 US study found that transvaginal ultrasound and cancer marker CA125 screening did not reduce ovarian cancer mortality. In contrast, a more recent UK study found that up to 20% of ovarian cancer deaths could be prevented through annual performance of these procedures.\n\nPrevention for an individual deemed at risk of HGSC has, up until recently, been (bilateral or unilateral) removal of both the ovary and the Fallopian tube (salpingo-oophorectomy).\n\nWith hormonal and even morbidity issues resulting from ovary removal, and the increased evidence for the role of the Fallopian tubes HGSC pathogenesis, optimisation of this procedure has been to remove just the Fallopian tube(s) (salpingectomy) with the ovaries remaining until age of menopause - although critics of this argue that a reduced blood supply to the ovaries may induce premature menopause regardless.\n\nProphylactic salpingo-oophorectomy is frequently performed in carriers of BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutations, although the benefits conferred by this procedure may vary dependent on the specific mutation.\n\nTubal ligation is a less impactful prophylactic treatment shown to significantly reduce the risk of HGSC.\n\nCytoreductive “debulking” surgery may be performed prior to chemotherapy treatment in order to decrease the physical mass of the tumour and thus reduce the number of chemotherapy cycles needed. The typical advanced presentation as well as extra-ovarian spread seen in HGSC can require aggressive debulking procedures. In some cases total abdominal hysterectomy will be performed, in other cases where the patient intends to bear children a salpingo-oophorectomy is performed instead.\n\nTypical chemotherapy is six cycles of intraperitoneally-delivered platinum-base adjuvant chemotherapy with agents such as carboplatin. Measurements of blood CA125 levels are used to determine patient response to the treatment.\n\nBetween 20% and 30% of patients relapse within six months of treatment.\n\nPoly ADP ribose polymerase (PARP) inhibitors are another possible treatment, with carriers of BRCA1/2 mutations being the most responsive \n\nA study of incidence rates in the US between 1992 and 1999 found that the age-specific incidence rate for HGSC doubles every 10 years up until age 55, where it plateaus at approximately 20 cases per 100,000 women - before dropping dramatically after age 75.\n\nOvarian cancer incidence rates are low in East Asia and highest in Europe, the United States, and Australia/New Zealand.\n\nSince 1975, survival rates for ovarian cancer have steadily improved with a mean decrease of 51% by 2006 of risk of death from ovarian cancer for an advanced stage tumour. The increase has mainly been due to successful extended life expectancy of affected patients rather than an improvement in cure rates.\n\nA racial disparity exists between black and white women in the US, where black women experience a higher mortality risk from ovarian cancer.\n"}

{"id": "44706575", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=44706575", "title": "Jean-Marie Coquard", "text": "Jean-Marie Coquard\n\nReverend Father Jean-Marie Coquard (27 November 1859 – 27 June 1933) was a French Christian medical missionary who traveled to Abeokuta, Nigeria, which is the capital of the Ogun State, to provide surgery and care. He was supervisor and visitor at the Abeokuta missionary and doctor to the Egba Government and Royal Family. He is known for establishing the Sacred Heart Hospital in Abeokuta, being the longest serving missionary of the Society for African Missions, receiving an OBE for his work, being recognized by the government of Nigeria, and being “a stubborn individualist with a contentious streak” and one of the outstanding missionaries of his generation.\n\nJean-Marie Coquard was born on November 27, 1859, in the Diocese of Nantes, France into a Catholic working-class family. Coquard was the second child and only son of Marie Louise and Francois-Marie Coquard, a \"paludier\" and cattle farmer. A few years after his birth, Coquard's family moved to the hamlet of Fontainebras. However, much of Coquard early life and schooling took place in the village of Mesquer, where he attended the school of the Brothers of Christian Instruction. Then, at fourteen, Coquard enrolled in the merchant navy, where he first developed his love for the sea and desire to travel. Coquard recalled his years in the merchant navy fondly, writing many years later after becoming a missionary in Africa, “To see so many beautiful sailing ships in port and to chat with the crewmen makes going to sea irresistible for a twelve-year old boy from Mesquer.”\n\nAt the age of 24, while in Montevideo with the merchant navy, Coquard encountered the Sacred Heart Missionaries of Betharram, a group of Christian missionaries that ran a prestigious school. Given his interest in a priestly calling as well as the idea of becoming a missionary, Coquard commenced schooling in Montevideo for the next four years. However, in 1886, Coquard learned that he was rejected as a candidate for priesthood with the Sacred Heart Missionaries. Yet, remaining undiscouraged, Coquard took rejection from Sacred Heart as a direction from God to go to Africa. Thus, Coquard applied for, and this time was accepted, to the Society of African Missions. Then, in 1890, Coquard sailed to West Africa, where he would remain for the last 43 years of his life, with the exception of two short return trips to Europe.\n\nCoquard's involvement in Abeokuta was one of the many missionary influences in Yorubaland over the years. The earliest Christian missionaries to Yorubaland came from Europe and America with the goal of proselytizing the Egba tribe. Initially, Christianity was not well received, but with time, Egba chiefs in Abeokuta allowed missionary work as a means of protection against hostile neighbors. However, missionaries quickly realized and exploited the fact that [Abeokuta]] could serve as the central gateway for Christianity to spread throughout Yorubaland.\n\nThe history of Christian missionaries in Yorubaland, and Abeokuta specifically, had mixed and numerous social, religious, economic, and political impacts in the region.\n\nSocially, the introduction of Christianity encouraged the expansion of cultural heritage in Yorubaland. That is, Christianity brought the increased study of European languages as well as newer systems of education and thought, including the establishment of primary, secondary, and technical schooling. The Abeokuta Grammar School was the first secondary school in Nigeria, established by the Anglicans in 1908. Coquard promoted education for women as well, and the school began to admit girls in 1914. The Abeokuta Grammar School teaches not just academics but character with expressions such as “my character is greater than my books.” Bishop Terrien of the Abeokuta mission opened St. Gregory's College in 1928 as the first Catholic Secondary School. In addition, Yorubaland experienced newer styles of architecture, which become evident in the details of chapels and cathedrals. Coquard's Sacred Heart Hospital also had a very European style as it had two wings, both two stories with columns and terraces and two towers that overlooked a square. The whole town of Abeokuta was rapidly modernizing with the introduction of an automobile, motorcycles, electricity, and a water tower. Coquard wrote at the time of the Sacred Heart Hospital's opening, “Thus you see, if not in the twinkling of an eye, certainly day by day, this great town is undergoing a transformation.”\n\nReligiously, Christianity had an adverse effect on traditional religious practices of the regions by encouraging the development of various institutions that promoted higher ideals and standards of morality. Christian influence also led to the emergence of the African church movements, including the Church of the Lord, the Christ Apostolic Church, and others. The Abeokuta was supposed to be the capital for efforts to convert West Africans. At the Abeokuta mission, there were prayers twice a day. Moreover, at the hospital Coquard claimed that they treated not just the body, but also the soul. The mission gained the respect of the people of Abeokuta as they cured patients with illnesses that used to be a death sentence. And thus many of the Abeokuta people began to convert. They baptized over three hundred people in just the first year Coquard was there. Additionally, they were able to continue teaching Christianity to the students of St. Gregory's School.\n\nPolitically, Christian missionary work intervened considerably in Yoruba politics. In order to maintain their own security and survival, missionary societies invited European intervention in government, often to destructive effect. For example, at the encouragement of British missionaries, the British Consul to Yorubaland bombed Lagos in order to force out Portuguese influence and maintain British control of the region. Furthermore, such intervention eventually facilitated annexation and colonization efforts later in the 19th century. The Abeokuta government actually was very supportive of the mission with little adverse effect. The government backed construction of the hospital which eventually provided dependable primary care to the people. Within the Abeokuta mission, there were frequent power struggles, particularly involving Coquard as he was very independent and self-assured, but the vicariate did not attempt to influence the local politics.\n\nJean-Marie Coquard was ordained a priest in 1880. He left Europe in November of the same year after a formal departure ceremony which the Cardinal Archbishop of Lyon attended. The Archbishop honored ten missionaries all leaving for Africa by kissing their feet. When they landed in Lagos after twenty-five days at sea, Coquard was greeted by excited school children and stood in awe at the benediction. He wrote in a letter to Rev. Father Planque, superior-general of the African missions of Lyons, “it is impossible to describe the joy of my Christians.” He claimed that it was at the Corpus Christi procession that night that “Christ the Saviour went out from the walls of our modest church, for the first time, to show Himself to His people ; and...each one seemed to understand that something grand and majestic was passing, and, without being able to explain the reason, felt awed.”\n\nUpon his arrival in Abeokuta in 1890, Coquard was put in charge of medical work at the mission dispensary under the guidance of Fr. Justin François. But four days after Coquard's arrival, he was left as the mission supervisor while François was traveling. He didn't know the language, so patients and mission boys served as his interpreters. \nWith the exception of a five-week apprenticeship, Coquard was largely self-taught. Although he had received no formal medical training, he reportedly demonstrated an extraordinary interest and ability for medical work. At the mission, there were no actual medical professionals, but they received permission from the Propaganda Fide for the clergy to perform surgery. Coquard quickly became much sought-after and beloved among the Egba people. In 1893, he was officially put in charge of the dispensary.\nHe also sought to help the lepers who were forced to live outside the city. He and Father François wanted to build a more permanent home for them, a goal they worked toward for six years. Finally in 1897, the leprosarium was realized.\nOver the course of his time at the Abeokuta mission, Coquard wrote frequently to Le Petit Messager to gain support for various mission projects. He described the Egba people living in Abeokuta and stressed that often patients left the mission not only cured of illness but also converted. In response to his articles, European readers of the journal sent him medical equipment and books as well as church props such as altar cloths, etc. In his letters to the Messenger, Coquard focused on the difference Christianity could have on the children taken into the orphanage at the mission and encouraged the sponsoring of individual children.\nHis primary goal, however, was building a hospital for the sick, the orphans, and the elderly. After spending some time at the mission, Coquard was convinced of the importance of his medical work for the mission, and he began advocating for the hospital despite the blatant lack of resources. He cited the expense of the time taken for long journeys to see patients who could not be accommodated due to lack of space at the mission and the fact that sometimes patients even had to sleep in the horse's stable. The mission then began accepting payment for medical care at the request of one of the Egba chiefs who wanted to ensure that the Egba people would receive proper care. The funds were a considerable help since the mission was barely staying afloat, and the financial boost allowed Coquard's hospital to be approved. Even with all the financial support from Europe as well, they still lacked the capital to actually complete the hospital. Coquard accordingly used a portion of the funds that were specifically designated for the leprosarium, for which he was criticized by many. The hospital was eventually completed in 1895.\nAfter the death of Father François in 1895, Coquard became the superior in Abeokuta. However, the following year when it became apparent that he wasn't following certain restrictions, he was sent to South America to fundraise. He was angry about being forced out of his position, but he had every intention of returning. As for the actual fundraising work, he called it pitiable since the people he was requesting donations from were so poor. He came back with an idea as well as the funding for a Christian village. He used the new project as a way to ensure his continued position at the mission, and in 1902, he was named visitor, responsible for the spiritual welfare of the confreres.\nHe began advocating for an addition to the leprosarium and for a newer hospital in 1903. His plans were for a grand two story hospital building. Bishop Lang found the layout including towers and terraces excessive and Bishop Paul Pellet ordered Coquard to only build a one-story building, but Coquard began construction without their approval. The Egba government and the Egba people held him in high regard and supported the construction of the new hospital. Although Coquard's strong personality often put him at odds with Society of African Missions leaders, Coquard's labor and medical work culminated in the establishment of the Sacred Heart Hospital. On May 5, 1911 with the Alake, his court, and members of the government in attendance, the new Sacred Heart Hospital was opened by the governor of Lagos, Sir Walter Egerton, who had also laid the foundation stone in 1904.\nSince Coquard was getting older, they wanted to be able to ensure that the hospital would not collapse after his decease. The government promised to ensure the hospital's future, and Coquard decided it would be best if the hospital was put under a doctor's supervision immediately while he just continued with administration work. However, instead of the government continuing the hospital's existence as initially planned, the Wuerzburg Institute ended up providing staff for the hospital.\nIn 1917, orders from the Propaganda Fide prevented Coquard from even practicing first-aid. In his anger, Coquard wrote letters that were offensive to many high-standing mission leaders. Because Coquard had brought the mission into debt, repeatedly disobeyed Bishop Terrien's orders and was now disrespecting his supervisors, many wanted him to be removed. In 1919, Coquard resigned from his position as superior of the Abeokuta mission. He was recalled to France, but the Egba people were outraged and petitioned for him to stay.\nIn 1923, he tried to implement a nursing sisterhood since there were so many women, both young and old, who spent their lives working at the hospital but never earned a degree. This progressive idea of women's education sadly was never realized. He did, however, open a school for midwives two years later that in 1998 became a general nursing school.\nIn 1933, after many dedicated years of missionary service Coquard died in Abeokuta.\n\nFather Coquard made contributions in Abeokuta much like Albert Schweitzer did in Lambaréné, Gabon in French Equatorial Guinea. While Schweitzer was religious and claimed that his mission was given to him by Jesus, he was not technically a religious missionary; yet he filled a quite similar role to that of Coquard. Both men were in charge of the medical efforts at their respective missions. They both pioneered efforts to create hospitals as well as leprosariums and also undertook expansions of the medical buildings. Additionally, they did much of the work single-handedly. Father Coquard was Sacred Heart's primary architect, fundraiser, and supervisor, as Albert Schweitzer had been of the hospital in Lambaréné. They were both proud men who had strong egos.\nThey also both wrote a significant amount over the course of their missionary work. Schweitzer wrote a book, The Primeval Forest, while Coquard wrote numerous articles and the Cronique d’Abeokuta, a history of the mission. Schweitzer and Coquard referred to the relationship between Europeans and Africans in the same way in their writing, calling Europeans “older brothers” and “elder brothers” respectively. While neither man was overtly racist, this language has racist undertones implying a belief in the superiority of whites over blacks. For Coquard at least, this viewpoint is a result of the fact that he was in Africa as a religious missionary; clearly he believed his culture was dominant if his intentions were to convert the West Africans. And Schweitzer grapples frequently with the issue of race in his book as he tries to see blacks as equals but still has different expectations of Africans. One difference between the men is that Schweitzer clearly segregated his hospital, building a separate building for white patients while Coquard's hospital according to the Lagos Standard, “makes no distinction of creed or colour in the objects of its benevolence.” Schweitzer and Coquard both performed work that resulted in the availability of medical care for West Africans, indicating that they did care about the African people but saw white men as higher up the social ladder.\n\nJean-Marie Coquard is remembered for his 43 years of missionary work in Yorubaland, only returning to Europe twice in so many years. He holds the record within the Society of African Missions for the longest missionary tour at 25 years.\nThe Sacred Heart Hospital was his greatest accomplishment. It is the oldest hospital outside of Lagos. As written in The Lagos Standard on Wednesday, Oct 25, 1911, “the hospital itself is a monument of what can be accomplished through the energy, zeal, patience, and devotion of a single individual...who was described by Sir Walter Egerton as having been ‘his architect, engineer, and labourer’ in building the hospital.” Upon the opening of the new hospital in 1911, the government built a road from the Alake’s palace to the hospital, which they called Fr. Coquard Road in tribute to him.\nHe was made a chief by Alake Ademola and given the title Baasegun of Egba and later also named an Officer of the Order of the British Empire by the British Government. In 1935, a new locomotive was named “the Jean-Marie Coquard” by the Nigerian government so no one would forget the priest-doctor. A Memorial School was planned, but with the decease of its chief proponent, Bishop O’Rourke, the school was named St. Peter's instead. In 1954, a life-size bronze statue was erected in front of the original hospital in his honor. It was unveiled by the Alake himself with the archbishop in the audience, and the same night the Abeokuta chief talked about Coquard's work and accomplishments on the radio. The following day, a mass was held to repose his soul.\nHe was a confident and often stubborn man. He was determined to achieve his goals and sought powerful positions. He often chafed under the rule of others and had frequent disagreements with his superiors. Although he was disinclined to obey the directions of his supervisors, he interacted with them in an honorable manner. He was on good terms with the Egba government as well as the British colonial representatives and was always a good friend to the Egba people.

The series, along with various educational materials including a companion comic book with additional adventures of the characters, was developed by the Michigan State University Cooperative Extension Service.\n\nThe series centers on the humorous adventures of a group of five school-aged kids who are all members of a rock band called \"Mulligan Stew\" (also referred to as the \"Stews\" or the \"Mulligan Stew Force\").\n\nThe band members are: \n\n(Mulligan, Maggie and Micki all sing lead vocals on most of the band's songs while Mike and Manny usually handle backing vocals.) The group's clubhouse is a basement in a brownstone apartment, fully furnished with a kitchen, shortwave radio, home gym, laboratory, and even a small stage where they rehearse their music. \n\nTheir grownup advisor and mentor is Wilbur Dooright (Barry Michlin), a bespectacled, bumbling accountant who, in some episodes, gives the kids their assignments \"from upstairs\", assumed to be a secret governmental organization (paying homage to the spy films and TV shows of the day). Wilbur provides much of the comic relief throughout the series.\n\nAn integral and ubiquitous part of the program's message was the \"4-4-3-2\" balanced diet program, part of the standard USDA nutrition guidelines/recommendations promoted during the 1960s and 1970s. The use of dietary supplements was strongly discouraged; it was taught that all nutritional needs, including the proper intake of vitamins, minerals, fats and carbohydrates, could be adequately obtained solely by adhering to a balanced diet, with appropriate servings from the \"basic four\" food groups. This message was enthusiastically repeated by the children several times per episode. (The \"basic four\" food groups were updated by USDA in subsequent decades by the 1990s-era \"Food Guide Pyramid\" and the current \"MyPlate\" nutritional guidelines program.)\n\n\"Mulligan Stew\" was developed in early 1971 by the USDA Extension Service, and filmed by the USDA Motion Picture Service (which for many years prior produced educational cinematic films and TV programs for public viewing). \"Mulligan Stew\" was developed based on plan and design proposals by Developmental Committees, Iowa State University Extension Service 4-H Nutrition Television Programs. The Expanded Food and Nutrition Education Program (EFNEP) provided a grant to produce the series. (4-H is the official youth outreach and development program of the land-grant universities' Cooperative Extension Services and USDA.)\n\nThe target audience of the program was older elementary school students, fourth through sixth grade.\n\nEleanor Wilson, the national 4-H TV coordinator at the time, was tapped to be the series' technical advisor. Wilson subcontracted with Iowa State University to develop an outline of educational concepts for the series. USDA Extension then hired Ira Klugerman to direct the series. Klugerman, who came from a background of children's television at WQED in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, came up with the title and general treatment for the series. V. \"Buddy\" Renfro was the credited producer.\n\nProduction began on location in southeast Washington, DC in 1971 (the opening sequence was filmed at RFK Stadium). Other filming locations included major production partner Michigan State University's home base of Lansing, Michigan, and on location for one episode at Johnson Space Center in Houston. The low budget of the project proved to be a significant challenge, as well as the unique challenges of working with child actors.\n\nThe producers wanted the style of the series to reflect trends begun in other popular and innovative TV shows such as \"Sesame Street\" and \"Laugh-In\". Puppetry and animation were frequently used. Sometimes one or two of the kids would conduct \"man-on-the-street\" interviews, asking ordinary citizens about nutrition-related topics. All of the music, including the theme song and the various songs sung by the kids during an episode (many times in musical \"romps\" reminiscent of the ones seen on \"The Monkees\" TV series), were composed and arranged by Washington, DC musician and recording engineer Paul Brier, and performed by a rock combo credited on screen as \"The Eye\".\n\n\"Mulligan Stew\" premiered on October 4, 1972, during the National 4-H Week at the National 4-H Center in Washington, DC. The program was considered a success, especially by previous standards for television outreach sponsored by 4-H. The series had a moderate impact on kids making better choices in what they ate, and provided 4-H with a sizable marketing, promotional and public relations boost. Thanks in part to the popularity of \"Mulligan Stew\", 4-H membership was boosted to an all-time high in 1974, and continued to air in reruns on public television until 1981.\n\nSeveral celebrities or future celebrities made uncredited appearances, either as part of the main storyline or in brief segments; among these were Richard Sanders who later gained fame playing Les Nessman on WKRP in Cincinnati. Ordinary citizens were interviewed by the kids in selected segments of some episodes in a \"man on the street\" format.\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "3762029", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=3762029", "title": "Osteochondritis dissecans", "text": "Osteochondritis dissecans\n\nOsteochondritis dissecans (OCD or OD) is a joint disorder in which cracks form in the articular cartilage and the underlying subchondral bone. OCD usually causes pain and swelling of the affected joint which catches and locks during movement. Physical examination typically reveals an effusion, tenderness, and a crackling sound with joint movement.\nOCD is caused by blood deprivation in the subchondral bone. This loss of blood flow causes the subchondral bone to die in a process called avascular necrosis. The bone is then reabsorbed by the body, leaving the articular cartilage it supported prone to damage. The result is fragmentation (dissection) of both cartilage and bone, and the free movement of these bone and cartilage fragments within the joint space, causing pain and further damage. OCD can be difficult to diagnose because these symptoms are found with other diseases. However, the disease can be confirmed by X-rays, computed tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans.\nNon-surgical treatment is rarely an option as the ability for articular cartilage to heal is limited. As a result, even moderate cases require some form of surgery. When possible, non-operative forms of management such as protected reduced or non-weight bearing and immobilization are used. Surgical treatment includes arthroscopic drilling of intact lesions, securing of cartilage flap lesions with pins or screws, drilling and replacement of cartilage plugs, stem cell transplantation, and joint replacement. After surgery rehabilitation is usually a two-stage process of immobilization and physical therapy. Most rehabilitation programs combine efforts to protect the joint with muscle strengthening and range of motion. During the immobilization period, isometric exercises, such as straight leg raises, are commonly used to restore muscle loss without disturbing the cartilage of the affected joint. Once the immobilization period has ended, physical therapy involves continuous passive motion (CPM) and/or low impact activities, such as walking or swimming.\nOCD occurs in 15 to 30 people per 100,000 in the general population each year. Although rare, it is an important cause of joint pain in physically active adolescents. Because their bones are still growing, adolescents are more likely than adults to recover from OCD; recovery in adolescents can be attributed to the bone's ability to repair damaged or dead bone tissue and cartilage in a process called bone remodeling. While OCD may affect any joint, the knee tends to be the most commonly affected, and constitutes 75% of all cases. Franz König coined the term osteochondritis dissecans in 1887, describing it as an inflammation of the bone–cartilage interface. Many other conditions were once confused with OCD when attempting to describe how the disease affected the joint, including osteochondral fracture, osteonecrosis, accessory ossification center, osteochondrosis, and hereditary epiphyseal dysplasia. Some authors have used the terms \"osteochondrosis dissecans\" and \"osteochondral fragments\" as synonyms for OCD.\nIn osteochondritis dissecans, fragments of cartilage or bone become loose within a joint, leading to pain and inflammation. These fragments are sometimes referred to as joint mice. OCD is a type of osteochondrosis in which a lesion has formed within the cartilage layer itself, giving rise to secondary inflammation. OCD most commonly affects the knee, although it can affect other joints such as the ankle or the elbow.\n\nPeople with OCD report activity-related pain that develops gradually. Individual complaints usually consist of mechanical symptoms including pain, swelling, catching, locking, popping noises, and buckling / giving way; the primary presenting symptom may be a restriction in the range of movement. Symptoms typically present within the initial weeks of stage I; however, the onset of stage II occurs within months and offers little time for diagnosis. The disease progresses rapidly beyond stage II, as OCD lesions quickly move from stable cysts or fissures to unstable fragments. Non-specific symptoms, caused by similar injuries such as sprains and strains, can delay a definitive diagnosis.\n\nPhysical examination typically reveals fluid in the joint, tenderness, and crepitus. The tenderness may initially spread, but often reverts to a well-defined focal point as the lesion progresses. Just as OCD shares symptoms with common maladies, acute osteochondral fracture has a similar presentation with tenderness in the affected joint, but is usually associated with a fatty hemarthrosis. Although there is no significant pathologic gait or characteristic alignment abnormality associated with OCD, the patient may walk with the involved leg externally rotated in an attempt to avoid tibial spine impingement on the lateral aspect of the medial condyle of the femur.\n\nDespite much research, the causes remain unclear but include repetitive physical trauma, ischemia (restriction of blood flow), hereditary and endocrine factors, avascular necrosis (loss of blood flow), rapid growth, deficiencies and imbalances in the ratio of calcium to phosphorus, and problems of bone formation. Although the name \"osteochondritis\" implies inflammation, the lack of inflammatory cells in histological examination suggests a non-inflammatory cause. It is thought that repetitive microtrauma, which leads to microfractures and sometimes an interruption of blood supply to the subchondral bone, may cause subsequent localized loss of blood supply or alteration of growth.\n\nTrauma, rather than avascular necrosis, is thought to cause osteochondritis dissecans in juveniles. In adults, trauma is thought to be the main or perhaps the sole cause, and may be endogenous, exogenous or both. The incidence of repetitive strain injury in young athletes is on the rise and accounts for a significant number of visits to primary care; this reinforces the theory that OCD may be associated with increased participation in sports and subsequent trauma. High-impact sports such as gymnastics, soccer, basketball, lacrosse, football, tennis, squash, baseball and weight lifting may put participants at a higher risk of OCD in stressed joints (knees, ankles and elbows).\n\nRecent case reports suggest that some people may be genetically predisposed to OCD. Families with OCD may have mutations in the aggrecan gene. Studies in horses have implicated specific genetic defects.\n\nOsteochondritis dissecans differs from \"wear and tear\" degenerative arthritis, which is primarily an articular surface problem. Instead, OCD is a problem of the bone underlying the cartilage, which may secondarily affect the articular cartilage. Left untreated, OCD can lead to the development of degenerative arthritis secondary to joint incongruity and abnormal wear patterns.\n\nOCD occurs when a loose piece of bone or cartilage partially (or fully) separates from the end of the bone, often because of a loss of blood supply (osteonecrosis) and decalcification of the trabecular bone matrix. The loose piece may stay in place or slide around, making the joint stiff and unstable. OCD in humans most commonly affects the knees, ankles, and elbow but can affect any joint.\n\nIn skeletally immature individuals, the blood supply to the epiphyseal bone is good, supporting both osteogenesis and chondrogenesis. With disruption of the epiphyseal plate vessels, varying degrees and depth of necrosis occur, resulting in a cessation of growth to both osteocytes and chondrocytes. In turn, this pattern leads to disordered ossification of cartilage, resulting in subchondral avascular necrosis and consequently OCD.\n\nFour minor stages of OCD have been identified after trauma. These include revascularization and formation of granulation (scar) tissue, absorption of necrotic fragments, intertrabecular osteoid deposition, and remodeling of new bone. With delay in the revascularization stage, an OCD lesion develops. A lesion can lead to articular-surface irregularities, which in turn may cause progressive arthritic deterioration.\n\nTo diagnose osteochondritis dissecans, an X-ray, CT scan or MRI scan can be performed to show necrosis of subchondral bone, formation of loose fragments, or both. Occasionally a nuclear medicine bone scan is used to assess the degree of loosening within the joint.\n\nPhysical examination often begins with examination of the patient's gait. In OCD of the knee, people may walk with the involved leg externally rotated in an attempt to avoid tibial spine impingement on the lateral aspect of the medial condyle of the femur.\n\nNext, the examining physician may check for weakness of the quadriceps. This examination may reveal fluid in the joint, tenderness, and crepitus. The Wilson test is also useful in locating OCD lesions of the femoral condyle. The test is performed by slowly extending the knee from 90 degrees, maintaining internal rotation. Pain at 30 degrees of flexion and relief with tibial external rotation is indicative of OCD.\n\nPhysical examination of a patient with ankle OCD often returns symptoms of joint effusion, crepitus, and diffuse or localized tenderness. Examination often reveals symptoms of generalized joint pain, swelling, and times with limited range of motion. Some with loose body lesions may report catching, locking, or both. The possibility of microtrauma emphasizes a need for evaluation of biomechanical forces at the knee in a physical examination. As a result, the alignment and rotation of all major joints in the affected extremity is common, as are extrinsic and intrinsic abnormalities concerning the affected joint, including laxity.\n\nX-rays show lucency of the ossification front in juveniles. In older people, the lesion typically appears as an area of osteosclerotic bone with a radiolucent line between the osteochondral defect and the epiphysis. The visibility of the lesion depends on its location and on the amount of knee flexion used. Harding described the lateral X-ray as a method to identify the site of an OCD lesion.\n\nMagnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is useful for staging OCD lesions, evaluating the integrity of the joint surface, and distinguishing normal variants of bone formation from OCD by showing bone and cartilage edema in the area of the irregularity. MRI provides information regarding features of the articular cartilage and bone under the cartilage, including edema, fractures, fluid interfaces, articular surface integrity, and fragment displacement. A low T1 and high T2 signal at the fragment interface is seen in active lesions. This indicates an unstable lesion or recent microfractures. While MRI and arthroscopy have a close correlation, X-ray films tend to be less inductive of similar MRI results.\n\nComputed tomography (CT) scans and Technetium-99m bone scans are also sometimes used to monitor the progress of treatment. Unlike plain radiographs (X-rays), CT scans and MRI scans can show the exact location and extent of the lesion. Technetium bone scans can detect regional blood flow and the amount of osseous uptake. Both of these seem to be closely correlated to the potential for healing in the fragment.\nOCD is classified by the progression of the disease in stages.\nThere are two main staging classifications used; one is determined by MRI diagnostic imaging while the other is determined arthroscopically. However, both stagings represent the pathological conditions associated with OCD's natural progression.\n\nWhile the arthroscopic classification of bone and cartilage lesions is considered standard, the Anderson MRI staging is the main form of staging used in this article. Stages I and II are stable lesions. Stages III and IV describe unstable lesions in which a lesion of the cartilage has allowed synovial fluid between the fragment and bone.\n\nTreatment options include modified activity with or without weight bearing; immobilization; cryotherapy; anti-inflammatory medication; drilling of subchondral bone; microfracture; removal or reattachment of loose bodies; mosaicplasty and osteoarticular transfer system (OATS) procedures. The primary goals of treatment are:\nThe articular cartilage's capacity for repair is limited: partial-thickness defects in the articular cartilage do not heal spontaneously, and injuries of the articular cartilage which fail to penetrate subchondral bone tend to lead to deterioration of the articular surface. As a result, surgery is often required in even moderate cases where the osteochondral fragment has not detached from the bone (Anderson Stage II, III).\n\nCandidates for non-operative treatment are limited to skeletally immature teenagers with a relatively small, intact lesion and the absence of loose bodies. Non-operative management may include activity modification, protected weight bearing (partial or non-weight bearing), and immobilization. The goal of non-operative intervention is to promote healing in the subchondral bone and prevent potential chondral collapse, subsequent fracture, and crater formation.\n\nOnce candidates for treatment have been screened, treatment proceeds according to the lesion's location. For example, those with OCD of the knee are immobilized for four to six weeks or even up to six months in extension to remove shear stress from the involved area; however, they are permitted to walk with weight bearing as tolerated. X-rays are usually taken three months after the start of non-operative therapy; if they reveal that the lesion has healed, a gradual return to activities is instituted. Those demonstrating healing by increased radiodensity in the subchondral region, or those whose lesions are unchanged, are candidates to repeat the above described three-month protocol until healing is noted.\n\nThe choice of surgical versus non-surgical treatments for osteochondritis dissecans is controversial. Consequently, the type and extent of surgery necessary varies based on patient age, severity of the lesion, and personal bias of the treating surgeon—entailing an exhaustive list of suggested treatments. A variety of surgical options exist for the treatment of persistently symptomatic, intact, partially detached, and completely detached OCD lesions. Post-surgery reparative cartilage is inferior to healthy hyaline cartilage in glycosaminoglycan concentration, histological, and immunohistochemical appearance. As a result, surgery is often avoided if non-operative treatment is viable.\n\nIf non-surgical measures are unsuccessful, drilling may be considered to stimulate healing of the subchondral bone. Arthroscopic drilling may be performed by using an antegrade (from the front) approach from the joint space through the articular cartilage, or by using a retrograde (from behind) approach through the bone outside of the joint to avoid penetration of the articular cartilage. This has proven successful with positive results at one-year follow-up with antegrade drilling in nine out of eleven teenagers with the juvenile form of OCD, and in 18 of 20 skeletally immature people (follow-up of five years) who had failed prior conservative programs.\n\nPins and screws can be used to secure flap (sometimes referred to as hinged) lesions. Bone pegs, metallic pins and screws, and other bioresorbable screws may be used to secure these types of lesions.\n\nThe three methods most commonly used in treating full thickness lesions are arthroscopic drilling, abrasion, and microfracturing.\n\nIn 1946, Magnusson established the use of stem cells from bone marrow with the first surgical debridement of an OCD lesion. These cells typically differentiate into fibrocartilage and rarely form hyaline cartilage. While small lesions can be resurfaced using this form of surgery, the repair tissue tends to have less strength than normal hyaline cartilage and must be protected for 6 to 12 months. Results for large lesions tend to diminish over time; this can be attributed to the decreased resilience and poor wear characteristics of the fibrocartilage.\n\nIn attempts to address the weaker structure of the reparative fibrocartilage, new techniques have been designed to fill the defect with tissue that more closely simulates normal hyaline articular cartilage. One such technique is autologous chondrocyte implantation (ACI), which is useful for large, isolated femoral defects in younger people. In this surgery, chondrocytes are arthroscopically extracted from the intercondylar notch of the articular surface. The chondrocytes are grown and injected into the defect under a periosteal patch. ACI surgery has reported good to excellent results for reduced swelling, pain and locking in clinical follow-up examinations. However, some physicians have preferred to use undifferentiated pluripotential cells, such as periosteal cells and bone marrow stem cells, as opposed to chondrocytes. These too have demonstrated the ability to regenerate both the cartilage and the underlying subchondral bone.\n\nSimilar to OATS, arthroscopic articular cartilage paste grafting is a surgical procedure offering cost-effective, long-lasting results for stage IV lesions. A bone and cartilage paste derived from crushed plugs of the non-weight-bearing intercondylar notch can achieve pain relief, repair damaged tissue, and restore function.\n\nSome methods of fixation for unstable lesions include countersunk compression screws and Herbert screws or pins made of stainless steel or materials that can be absorbed by the body. If loose bodies are found, they are removed. Although each case is unique and treatment is chosen on an individual basis, ACI is generally performed on large defects in skeletally mature people.\n\nContinuous passive motion (CPM) has been used to improve healing of the articular surface during the postoperative period for people with full-thickness lesions. It has been shown to promote articular cartilage healing for small (< 3 mm in diameter) lesions in rabbits. Similarly, Rodrigo and Steadman reported that CPM for six hours per day for eight weeks produced an improved clinical outcome in humans.\n\nA rehabilitation program often involves protection of the compromised articular surface and underlying subchondral bone combined with maintenance of strength and range of motion. Post-operative analgesics, namely a mix of opioids and NSAIDs, are usually required to control pain, inflammation and swelling. Straight leg raising and other isometric exercises are encouraged during the post-operative or immobilization period. A six to eight-week home or formal physical therapy program is usually instituted once the immobilization period has ended, incorporating range of motion, stretching, progressive strengthening, and functional or sport-specific training. During this time, patients are advised to avoid running and jumping, but are permitted to perform low impact activities, such as walking or swimming. If patients return to activity before the cartilage has become firm, they will typically complain of pain during maneuvers such as squatting or jumping.\n\nThe prognosis after different treatments varies and is based on several factors which include the age of the patient, the affected joint, the stage of the lesion and, most importantly, the state of the growth plate. It follows that the two main forms of osteochondritis dissecans are defined by skeletal maturity. The juvenile form of the disease occurs in open growth plates, usually affecting children between the ages of 5 and 15 years. The adult form commonly occurs between ages 16 to 50, although it is unclear whether these adults developed the disease after skeletal maturity or were undiagnosed as children.\n\nThe prognosis is good for stable lesions (stage I and II) in juveniles with open growth plates; treated conservatively—typically without surgery—50% of cases will heal. Recovery in juveniles can be attributed to the bone's ability to repair damaged or dead bone tissue and cartilage in a process called bone remodeling. Open growth plates are characterized by increased numbers of undifferentiated chondrocytes (stem cells) which are precursors to both bone and cartilaginous tissue. As a result, open growth plates allow for more of the stem cells necessary for repair in the affected joint. Unstable, large, full-thickness lesions (stage III and IV) or lesions of any stage found in the skeletally mature are more likely to fail non-operative treatment. These lesions offer a worse prognosis and surgery is required in most cases.\n\nOCD is a relatively rare disorder, with an estimated incidence of 15 to 30 cases per 100,000 persons per year. Widuchowski W \"et al.\" found OCD to be the cause of articular cartilage defects in 2% of cases in a study of 25,124 knee arthroscopies. Although rare, OCD is noted as an important cause of joint pain in active adolescents. The juvenile form of the disease occurs in children with open growth plates, usually between the ages 5 and 15 years and occurs more commonly in males than females, with a ratio between 2:1 and 3:1. However, OCD has become more common among adolescent females as they become more active in sports. The adult form, which occurs in those who have reached skeletal maturity, is most commonly found in people 16 to 50 years old.\n\nWhile OCD may affect any joint, the knee—specifically the medial femoral condyle in 75–85% of knee cases—tends to be the most commonly affected, and constitutes 75% of all cases. The elbow (specifically the capitulum of the humerus) is the second most affected joint with 6% of cases; the talar dome of the ankle represents 4% of cases. Less frequent locations include the patella, vertebrae, the femoral head, and the glenoid of the scapula.\n\nThe condition was initially described by Alexander Monro (primus) in 1738.\nIn 1870, James Paget described the disease process for the first time, but it was not until 1887 that Franz König published a paper on the cause of loose bodies in the joint. In his paper, König concluded that:\nKönig named the disease \"osteochondritis dissecans\", describing it as a subchondral inflammatory process of the knee, resulting in a loose fragment of cartilage from the femoral condyle. In 1922, Kappis described this process in the ankle joint. On review of all literature describing transchondral fractures of the talus, Berndt and Harty developed a classification system for staging of osteochondral lesions of the talus (OLTs). The term osteochondritis dissecans has persisted, and has since been broadened to describe a similar process occurring in many other joints, including the knee, hip, elbow, and metatarsophalangeal joints.\n\n\nOCD also is found in animals, and is of particular concern in horses, as there may be a hereditary component in some horse breeds. Feeding for forced growth and selective breeding for increased size are also factors. OCD has also been studied in other animals—mainly dogs, especially the German Shepherd—where it is a common primary cause of elbow dysplasia in medium-large breeds.\n\nIn animals, OCD is considered a developmental and metabolic disorder related to cartilage growth and endochondral ossification. Osteochondritis itself signifies the disturbance of the usual growth process of cartilage, and OCD is the term used when this affects joint cartilage causing a fragment to become loose.\n\nAccording to the Columbia Animal Hospital the frequency of affected animals is dogs, humans, pigs, horses, cattle, chickens, and turkeys, and in dogs the most commonly affected breeds include the German Shepherd, Golden and Labrador Retriever, Rottweiler, Great Dane, Bernese Mountain Dog, and Saint Bernard. Although any joint may be affected, those commonly affected by OCD in the dog are: shoulder (often bilaterally), elbow, knee and tarsus.\n\nThe problem develops in puppyhood although often subclinically, and there may be pain or stiffness, discomfort on extension, or other compensating characteristics. Diagnosis generally depends on X-rays, arthroscopy, or MRI scans. While cases of OCD of the stifle go undetected and heal spontaneously, others are exhibited in acute lameness. Surgery is recommended once the animal has been deemed lame.\n\nOsteochondritis dissecans is difficult to diagnose clinically as the animal may only exhibit an unusual gait. Consequently, OCD may be masked by, or misdiagnosed as, other skeletal and joint conditions such as hip dysplasia.\n\n"}

This is largely due to the increase in the precaution of the dangers of smoking and enforcement of stricter legislation on the tobacco industry. In 1996 the provinces with the highest percentage and prevalence of smoking include Northern Cape (55%), Western Cape (48%) and North-West (46%). However, the number of smokers still remains stagnant. Despite the efforts to bring awareness to the risks that come with smoking, there is still a high prevalence of tobacco use in South Africa; and it is a major contributor to morbidity and mortality.\n\nAs more significant studies are published on smoking and second handing inhalation of smoke, the South African public has become more educated on the dangers of smoking. This has led to the overall decline in number of smokers and thus number of related deaths. Currently, approximately 50,000 South Africans die per year due to the effects smoking such as an increased risk for lung cancer and cardiovascular disease. In 2000 approximately 34,108 males and 10,306 died due to the various consequences of smoking. According to the latest South African National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey in 2012 only about 16.4% of South Africans smoked which is a substantial drop from 32% in 1993. This decrease is attributed to legislation which led to restrictions in advertisement, and an increase tobacco prices. However, a Youth Risk Behavior Survey found that 21% of students in grades 8-11 smoke. This shows little to no change between 2002 and 2008.\n\nIn order to combat the dangers of smoking, legislation has been increasingly put into place in order to deter the public from smoking. Beginning in 1993 with the Tobacco Products Control Act, South African began to pass legislation to in order to protect the public. It was fully implemented and enforced in 1995, meaning smoking in public places became some-what regulated. In addition, the act prohibited some aspects of advertisement, the promotion of tobacco products, and the publicity of a sponsorship is prohibited. Merchandise containing tobacco may be visible when being sold, however costumers are not allowed to handle the products prior to the purchase. Labeling was limited in some aspects, however was not heavily regulated until 1999. Notably the act prohibited the sale of tobacco products to minor under the age of 16.\n\nThe Tobacco Products Control Act of 1993 was considered to be incomplete and incomprehension, and in 1999 the South African government passed the Tobacco Products Control Amendment Act. This created stricter regulations for public smoking and banned smoking in public places such as restaurants, the work place and public transport. Being set into motion in 2001 the act prohibited all forms of tobacco advertising and promotion. Additionally, the act suggests penalties for those who transgress the law. The act also places a limit on the permissible levels of nicotine and tar.\n"}
{"id": "1274169", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1274169", "title": "Squat (exercise)", "text": "Squat (exercise)\n\nIn strength training and fitness, the squat is a compound, full body exercise that trains primarily the muscles of the thighs, hips and buttocks, quadriceps femoris muscle (vastus lateralis, vastus medialis, vastus intermedius and rectus femoris), hamstrings, as well as strengthening the bones, ligaments and insertion of the tendons throughout the lower body. Squats are considered a vital exercise for increasing the strength and size of the legs as well as developing core strength. Squats are typically used to hone back, thigh, and hip stability. Isometrically, the lower back, the upper back, the abdominals, the trunk muscles, the costal muscles, and the shoulders and arms are all essential to the exercise and thus are trained when squatting with the proper form.\n\nThe squat is one of the three lifts in the strength sport of powerlifting, together with deadlifts and bench press. It is also considered a staple in many popular recreational exercise programs.\n\nWhen people discuss volume, the equation is sets performed times number of repetitions times external weight. Adding resistance to squats has been shown to affect the power and speed of the exercise. Though free-weight numbers fit nicely into the volume equation, adding resistance can complicate the equation and make volume less easy to calculate. More specifically, people have found that they can increase resistance while exercising by utilizing chains or rubber bands. One study discovered that the physical demand of exercises with resistance increases in a linear relationship with intensity. Differences in energy expenditure during squatting can be attributed to the various forms of movements, intensities, weights, repetitions, and types of items (Smith machine or barbell).\n\nIndividuals who are interested in strength training can utilize barbell squat in training and rehabilitation programs. If executed with proper form, the squat has the potential to develop knee stability. On the other hand, if done incorrectly, injuries to the knees and back can occur. The parallel squat is one way to increase knee flexion while activating the quadriceps and hamstrings. In the standard squat, it is crucial to have the shin vertical to minimize stress on the knee. Variations in squats include various knee placements and squat depths. For example, knees can be placed in knees in, knees out, and knees over toes; whereas squats can be performed at roughly 20°, 50°, and 80°. The parallel squat is more preferred than the deep squat because the potential of injury on the cruciate and menisci ligaments is higher in the latter.\n\nGluteus maximus (glutes), quadriceps (quads)\n\nThe movement begins from a standing position. Weight is often added; typically in the form of a loaded barbell but dumbbells and kettlebells may also be used. When a barbell is used, it may be braced across the upper trapezius muscle (a high bar squat) or held lower across the upper back and rear deltoids (a low bar squat). The movement is initiated by moving the hips back and bending the knees and hips to lower the torso and accompanying weight, then returning to the upright position.\n\nSquats can be performed to varying depths. The competition standard is for the crease of the hip (top surface of the leg at the hip joint) to fall below the top of the knee; this is colloquially known as \"parallel\" depth. Confusingly, many other definitions for \"parallel\" depth abound, none of which represents the standard in organized powerlifting. From shallowest to deepest, these other standards are: bottom of hamstring parallel to the ground; the hip joint itself below the top of the knee, or femur parallel to the floor; and the top of the upper thigh (i.e., top of the quadriceps) below the top of the knee.\n\nSquatting below parallel qualifies a squat as deep while squatting above it qualifies as shallow. Some authorities caution against deep squats; though the forces on the ACL and PCL decrease at high flexion, compressive forces on the menisci and articular cartilages in the knee peak at these same high angles. This makes the relative safety of deep versus shallow squats difficult to determine.\n\nAs the body gradually descends, the hips and knees undergo flexion, the ankle extends (\"dorsiflexes\") and muscles around the joint contract eccentrically, reaching maximal contraction at the bottom of the movement while slowing and reversing descent. The muscles around the hips provide the power out of the bottom. If the knees slide forward or cave in then tension is taken from the hamstrings, hindering power on the ascent. Returning to vertical contracts the muscles concentrically, and the hips and knees undergo extension while the ankle plantarflexes.\n\nTwo common errors include descending too rapidly and flexing the torso too far forward. Rapid descent risks being unable to complete the lift or causing injury. This occurs when the descent causes the squatting muscles to relax and tightness at the bottom is lost as a result. Over-flexing the torso greatly increases the forces exerted on the lower back, risking a spinal disc herniation.\n\nAnother error where health of the knee joint is concerned is when the knee is not aligned with the direction of the toes. If the knee is not tracking over the toes during the movement this results in twisting/shearing of the joint and unwanted torque affecting the ligaments which can soon result in injury. The knee should always follow the toe. Have your toes slightly pointed out in order to track the knee properly.\n\nSome common squat posture mistakes include:\n\nVarious types of equipment can be used to perform squats.\n\nA power cage can be used to reduce risk of injury and eliminate the need for a spotting partner. By putting the bar on a track, the Smith machine reduces the role of hip movement in the squat and in this sense resembles a leg press. The monolift rack allows an athlete to perform a squat without having to take a couple of steps back with weight on as opposed to conventional racks. Not many powerlifting federations allow monolift in competitions (WPO, GPC, IPO).\n\nOther equipment used can include a weight lifting belt to support the torso and boards to wedge beneath the ankles to improve stability and allow a deeper squat (weightlifting shoes also have wooden wedges built into the sole to achieve the same effect). Wrist straps are another piece of recommended equipment; they support the wrist and help to keep it in a straightened position. They should be wrapped around the wrist, above and below the joint, thus limiting movement of the joint. Heel wedges and related equipment are discouraged by some as they are thought to worsen form over the long term. The barbell can also be cushioned with a special padded sleeve.\n\nOn 8 October 2011, Jonas Rantanen of Finland performed a squat with a weight of 575 kg (1268 lb) at the Bullfarm Powerlifting Championships in Helsinki, beating the previous record by Donnie Thompson (USA) of 573 kg (1265 lb).\n\nThe single-ply squat record is held by Dustin Slepicka (USA) at 500 kg (1102 lb).\n\nThe raw world record with knee wraps is 500 kg (1102 lb) performed by Vlad Alhazov on 22 July 2017.<ref name=\"Vlad Alhazov hitting 1,102 lbs raw w/wraps\"></ref> and on September 2017 Mojtaba Maleki equalized this record \n\nThe raw world record without knee wraps belongs to Ray Williams who lifted 485 kg (1053 lb) on 4 March 2018, at the Arnold Classic in Columbus, Ohio.\n\nThe women world record belongs to Olga Gemaletdinova who lifted 310.0 kg (684 lb) on 5 May 2011.\n\nThe most squats with 130 kg in two minutes was Netherlands woman Maria Strik. She squat-lifted a weight of 130 kg, 29 times within two minutes.\n\nThe most bodyweight squats performed in one hour is 4,708 by Paddy Doyle (UK) on November 2007.\n\nThe most bodyweight sumo squats in one hour is 5,135, and was achieved by Dr. Thienna Ho (Vietnam) on December 2007.\n\nSilvio Sabba from Italy has :\n\nThe squat has a number of variants, some of which can be combined:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAlthough the squat has long been a basic element of weight training, it has in recent years been the subject of considerable controversy. Some trainers allege that squats are associated with injuries to the lumbar spine and knees. Others, however, continue to advocate the squat as one of the best exercises for building muscle and strength. Some coaches maintain that incomplete squats (those terminating above parallel) are both less effective and more likely to cause injury than a full squat (terminating with hips at or below knee level). A 2013 review concluded that deep squats performed with proper technique do not lead to increased rates of degenerative knee injuries and are an effective exercise. The same review also concluded that shallower squats may lead to degeneration in the lumbar spine and knees in the long-term.\n\nSquats can be used for some rehabilitative activities because they hone stability without excessive compression on the tibiofemoral joint and anterior cruciate ligament.\n\nIt is important to note that deeper squats are associated with higher compressive loads on patellofemoral joint. As a result, it is possible that people who suffer from pain in the patellofemoral joint cannot squat at increased depths. For some knee rehabilitation activities, patients might feel more comfortable with knee flexion between 0 and 50° because it places less force compared to deeper depths. Another study shows that decline squats at angles higher than 16° may not be beneficial for the knee and fails to decrease calf tension. Other studies have indicated that the best squat to hone quadriceps without inflaming the patellofemoral joint occurs between 0–50°.\n\nCombining single-limb squats and decline angles have been used to rehabilitate knee extensors. Conducting squats at a declined angle allows the knee to flex despite possible pain or lack of mobilization in the ankle. If therapists are looking to focus on the knee during squats, one study shows that doing single-limb squats at a 16° decline angle has the greatest activation of the knee extensors without placing excessive pressure on the ankles. This same study also found that a 24° decline angle can be used to strengthen ankles and knee extensors.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "14108393", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=14108393", "title": "Water supply and sanitation in Guatemala", "text": "Water supply and sanitation in Guatemala\n\nThe drinking water supply and sanitation sector in Guatemala is characterized by low and inconsistent service coverage, especially in rural areas; unclear allocation of management responsibilities; and little or no regulation and monitoring of service provision.\nIn 2015, around 1 million people lacked access to \"improved\" water and 6 million lacked access to \"improved\" sanitation. In Guatemala, 93% of the total population had access to \"improved\" water, 98% of the urban population and 87% of the rural population. As for sanitation, 64% of the total population, 78% and 49%, urban and rural respectively, had access to \"improved\" sanitation.\n\nAccording to the WHO/UNICEF Joint Monitoring Programme for Water Supply and Sanitation, access to water and sanitation services has slowly risen over the years in Guatemala. In 1990, 81% of the total population had access to improved water sources, while in 2004, 90% of the population had access. Sanitation coverage has also risen, from 62% of the total population having access to adequate sanitation in 1990, to 86% with access in 2004. The government of Guatemala estimates that the population with access to water services is growing at a rate of at least 100,001 people every year.\n\"Source\": Joint Monitoring Programme for Water Supply and Sanitation WHO/UNICEF\n\nAccurate and reliable data regarding coverage in rural areas is unavailable. Conflicting statistics as to the percentages of the population using improved drinking water sources present difficulties in assessing the seriousness of the problem. Although the data above shows that water and sanitation coverage in both rural and urban areas is fairly high in Guatemala, the National Water and Sanitation Information System (Sistema Nacional de Informacion de Agua y Saneamiento) (SAS), which collects and maintains information regarding water and sanitation in rural communities, released information in 2002 indicating that only 53% of homes (it is assumed that this statistic refers to households in rural areas due to the rural focus of SAS) had access to water services. The SAS considers accessible services to be less than 1 kilometer from a home and that at least 20 liters of water is available to each person every day. While 24,000 rural communities exist in Guatemala, SAS has only collected data from 36% of these, making it difficult to determine the actual number of individuals lacking services. \nAccess to water in urban areas is irregular, as 80% of urban water systems function for an average of 12 hours every day. As of the year 2000, 25% of water in urban systems was disinfected and only 1% of all collected sewage water has been treated.\n\nThe water and sanitation sector in Guatemala is characterized by “low coverage, poor quality services, and deteriorating physical assets,” related to a need for increased investments in basic infrastructures. Population growth, agricultural expansion, unevenly distributed services, and polluted sources have contributed to the inability of citizens to access adequate amounts of clean water.\n\nIn 1996 the government of Guatemala and the Guatemalan National Revolutionary Unity, the guerilla movement, signed a peace accord which ended 36 years of a civil, guerilla war. This conflict left over 100,000 Guatemalans dead and created over 1 million internally displaced refugees. This recent tumultuous history, along with a fairly new constitution written in 1985 and then again amended in 1993, can explain a lack of information regarding water and sanitation, as well as low service coverage.\n\nWhile many improvements have been made since the end of the war, Guatemala continually suffers from political violence and corruption, drug trafficking, and a large trade deficit. In light of these problems, it has been difficult for the national government to raise funds internally, or to attract assistance and investment from international donors and financial institutions. These financial setbacks prevent needed improvements in the countries’ general infrastructure, such as education, public health, and water and sanitation systems.\n\nFrom 1991 to 1998 the President of the Republic created a Secretary of Hydrological Resources whose mission was to order and plan the water sector and to make a Water Law. Several proposals for the law were turned down, largely due to the lack of a legal and institutional framework for managing water resources in Guatemala.\n\nIn 1995 COPECAS, in collaboration with other principal institutions, conducted a country-wide analysis of water and sanitation to address disorganization, contradictions and discrepancies in the sector. This study led to changes in the coordination and management of the sector, such as giving INFOM the responsibility to manage the sector.\n\nIn 1999 the Ministry of Agriculture, Livestock and Food (MAGA) was given responsibility for creating an Integrated Management Plan for Hydrological Resources, which will focus on water resources in terms of a political, legal and institutional framework, information and sustainability, and education.\n\nIn 2002 the Inter-American Development Bank gave Guatemala support for the reform and reorganization of INFOM in order to better serve and assist municipalities.\n\nThere are a multitude of government entities involved in water and sanitation and none of them has been assigned a clear leadership role in the sector. The Ministry of Health, the Municipal Development Agency (Instituto de Fomento Municipal)(INFOM), the Ministry of Environment and Natural Resources and the Planning Secretariat in the President's Office and all have a role, albeit ill-defined, in determining policies and strategies for water and sanitation, as well as for water resources management.\n\nINFOM, created in 1957, is a decentralized public institution whose mission is to support municipalities through the provision of administrative, financial, and technical assistance. In 1997 the Government Decree 376-97 gave INFOM the responsibility to manage the political and strategic aspects of the water and sanitation sector in Guatemala.\n\nIn the same year, the Executive Unit of the Rural Aqueduct Program (Unidad Ejectora del Programa de Acueductos Rurales) (UNEPAR) and the Highlands Drinking Water and Sanitation Project (Proyecto de Agua Potable y Saneamiento del Altiplano) (PAYSA), programs for rural water and sanitation that had formerly been under the Ministry of Health, were placed under the management of INFOM. Although UNEPAR is placed under INFOM it continues to have separate financing from the national budget as well as the German Development Bank KfW. UNEPAR also manages the data base of SAS.\n\nA Permanent Coordinating Committee for Water and Sanitation (Comité Permanente de Coordinación de Agua y Saneamiento) (COPECAS) was created in 1985 by the Government Decree (Acuerdo Gubernativo) 10036-85 to coordinate the work of all public agencies in the water and sanitation sector, but it is inactive. The committee is supported by the Pan–American Health Organization (PAHO).\n\nThere is no law granting all people the right to clean drinking water in Guatemala.\n\nThe Ministry of Public Health and Social Assistance (MSPAS) is legally responsible for monitoring drinking water quality at a national level.\nThey provide water quality testing services for private and public operators.\n\nThe Ministry of the Environment and Natural Resources (MARN), along with INFOM, is officially responsible for environmental regulation in the water and sanitation sector. However, there is no real effective environmental management in the sector.\n\nEconomic regulation in the sector is practically non-existent. Tariffs for service provision are determined by politics, and there are no organizations which monitor providers in order to detect abuses of the system.\n\nAccording to the law the provision of services is a responsibility of municipalities. Article 253 of the Constitution of the Republic of Guatemala gives the country's 332 municipalities the responsibility to use their resources to provide public services. In 2002 the Municipal Code published as Government Decree 12-2002 confirmed the legal responsibility of municipalities to deliver public services, including water and sanitation, to all those living in urban and rural areas.\n\nMunicipalities have a difficult time serving urban and especially rural areas due to a lack of resources. In reality, therefore, a variety of public, communal and private entities provide services alongside the municipalities.\n\nWater and sanitation services can be provided directly by a single municipality or through a group of municipalities who are organized to provide services together (“mancomunidades”).\n\nThe Municipality of Guatemala City created the Municipal Water Company (Empresa Municipal de Agua) (EMPAGUA) in 1972 to manage Guatemala City’s sewage and water services. Today it is the largest municipal water provider in the country. XELAGUA manages the water supplies in Quetzaltenango, Guatemala’s second largest city.\n\nThe Executive Unit of the National Xayá-Pixcayá Aqueduct (Unidad Ejecutora del Acueducto Nacional Xayá-Pixcayá), managed under the Ministry of Public Communications, Transportation and Labor, administers, operates, and maintains the National Aqueduct which supplies bulk water to Guatemala City.\n\nSeveral independent companies distribute potable water by tanker trucks and through private networks to rural and urban communities, serving at least 32% of Guatemala City alone. The National Mariscal Water Company (Compañía Nacional de Agua de Mariscal) is the largest and oldest of these companies, providing services to approximately 14% of the population of Guatemala City.\n\nCommunities themselves, through water committees (Comités administradores de agua potable, or CAAP), provide services in rural areas. Water committees are considered to be private operators and are regulated by the Civil Code. Committees are elected by community members and are responsible for the collection of tariffs and the operation and maintenance of the system.\n\nIt is written in Article 122 of the Constitution that all land within a 50-meter radius of a source of water is owned by the government of Guatemala. Communities and other private operators must purchase the land and water rights for a water source before developing a new system.\n\nAssistance to community-based service providers is a key function in the water and sanitation sector. In Guatemala this function is not clearly assigned to a government institution. INFOM, through UNEPAR (see above under policy), does provide this function. In addition, many NGOs also support community-based organizations.\n\nOne of them is Servicios para el Desarrollo (SER), a local NGO dedicated entirely to water and sanitation through its program \"Agua para todos\". Created in 1996, SER counts among its ranks 14 professionals from various disciplines dedicated to support communities in finding sustainable integrated, sustainable and affordable water and sanitation solutions. It also tries to raise the awareness of civil society and the state concerning water and sanitation, and undertakes research and documentation to systematically assess experiences in the sector.\n\nAnother is Agua del Pueblo (AdP) . Founded in 1972 in San Lucas Toliman, AdP has constructed more than 700 rural potable water projects. The State of Missouri incorporated the non-profit Agua del Pueblo-USA in 1973. At the time the state of Missouri only allowed English-named corporations. Agua del Pueblo-USA is also known as the People's Consultants . Eventually Agua del Pueblo's founders incorporated the Guatemalan: \"Associacion para Agua del Pueblo\"AdP is now headquartered in Quezaltenango with offices in Coban, Alta Vera Paz and Poptun, El Peten. AdP uses water as a means to the ultimate goal of rural development.\n\nAdditionally, several faith-based NGO's such as Water For Life International (www.h2oforlife.org), have been actively drilling fresh water wells, providing sanitation and educating the rural population about hygiene and health. Most of these groups have locations both in Guatemala and in the USA. Most also accept volunteers interested in helping Guatemala's poor overcome water poverty and provide ways in which to get involved.\n\nWater tariffs for municipally-managed systems are set by municipal councils for urban areas and by water users, through general meetings of users, for rural areas. In the case of privately owned small networks, which exist mainly in Guatemala City, and private water tankers, tariffs and prices are set by the private service providers. Since metering is not common, tariffs usually take the form of a monthly flat fee. Tariffs vary greatly from one locality to the other. In Guatemala city it stood at US$2.1 per month for 15 cubic meters, while in other towns it was as low as US$0.5 per month for 7.5 cubic meters.\n\nCost recovery in municipal and communal systems is generally low and usually revenues are barely sufficient to cover operating costs and routine maintenance. However, there are exceptions. For example, a program supported by USAID since 1992 in the Altiplano required communities to repay 50% of investment costs, which they did with only very limited payment arrears, showing the willingness of communities to pay for water supply.\n\nIn 2005 investments in water and sanitation stood at only US$14 million or about US$1/capita, one of the lowest levels in Latin America.\n\nIn 1999 investments had been much higher. The WHO estimated them at Quetzales 285.8 million (US$37.1).\nThis represented approximately 0.2% of the Gross Domestic Product and 1.5% of total government expenditures for 1999.\nSpending by the central government increased dramatically in the sector, with only US$6.07 million spent in 1995 to US$56.13 million spent in 1998.\nInvestments in the sector lagged far behind other sectors in 1998, especially when taking into consideration the previously small investments made in water and sanitation. For example, spending in each of the sectors of Education, Culture and Sports; Transportation; Defense and Security; and Work and Social Provision, exceeded that of the sector for Water and Sanitation by an average of 900%.\n\nGovernment sponsored investment is channeled through various organizations, including INFOM and UNEPAR, the Ministry of Health, the Social Investment Fund (Fondo de Inversión Social) (FIS), and the National Fund for Peace (Fondo Nacional para la Paz) (FONAPAZ).\nThe lack of cohesion amongst these organizations prohibits the coordinated growth and advancement of the water and sanitation sector. Various NGOs directly assist communities, especially in rural areas.\n\nA large share of the financing for water and sanitation comes from foreign donors. Communities and local governments, however, also make significant contributions in the form of unqualified labor, local materials and cash contributions. For example, under the program \"Agua, fuente de paz\" initiated in 1992, communities contributed 35% and local governments and other local stakeholders 25% of project costs, with only 40% financed by donors. The program supported 800 rural communities, focusing on those in extreme poverty.\n\nThe main donors currently active in the sector are the Inter-American Development Bank and NGOs such as CARE (relief) and Agua del Pueblo. Since 1994, the FIS has invested US$160 million in water and sanitation projects.\n\nA US$100,000 technical assistance grant for the GU-T1034 : Strengthening Office of the Presidential Commissioner for Water was approved in September 2005.\n\nA loan of $50 million for a GU0150 : Rural Water Investment Program\nwas approved in 2003 for the construction of potable water and sanitation projects to benefit a minimum of 500,000 new rural consumers. Loan components also include institutional strengthening of INFOM and community strengthening.\n\nKfW supported rural water and sanitation through a series of four projects implemented by UNEPAR and INFOM. The first three projects, executed between 1987 and 1998, benefited 165 communities in the western and eastern departments at a cost of 28 million Euros. A 2005 evaluation found that about 90% of the water systems were \"properly operated and maintained\", although only very few water committees disinfected water. The report also states that latrines built with support of the project were in good conditions.\n\nThe World Bank financed a US$50 million Guatemalan Second Social Investment Fund\nloan for community based projects implemented by the Social Fund FIS. The project was approved in 1998 and closed in 2003. It included 14% (US$7 million) dedicated to water and sanitation.\n\n\n\n"}

However, challenges remain, especially in rural areas.\n\nAccording to the Ministry of Health, in 2006 97% had access to potable water and also 97% had access to at least basic sanitation. WHO's and UNICEF's Joint Monitoring Program (JMP) estimates access to improved water supply in 2004 at 97% in urban areas and 82% in rural areas, while access to improved sanitation was 75% in urban areas and 50% in rural areas. The table below is updated with 2009 JMP data for water and sanitation coverage. \n\"Source\": Joint Monitoring Program WHO/UNICEF(JMP/2009).\n\nDespite a lack of statistical data about water quality and continuity of supply, potable water is perceived to be of good quality in Panama and most users receive continuous service.\n\nResponsibilities for the sector are allocated by the Panamanian Water Law, which was approved in 1997. As of 2016, the government considered reforming the water sector. by breaking up IDAAN into municipal-level service companies.\n\nThe Panamanian Health Ministry is responsible for defining the sector's policy, whereas the \"Autoridad Nacional de los Servicios Públicos\" ASEP or National Authority for Public Services acts as regulatory agency.\n\nResponsibility for water resources is vested in two institutions: The \"Autoridad Nacional del Ambiente\" or National Environment Authority and the \"Autoridad del Canal de Panamá\" or Panama Canal Authority.\n\nAccording to the Water Law, the \"Instituto de Acueductos y Alcantarillados Nacionales\" (IDAAN) is responsible for water and sanitation services in urban areas with more than 1,500 inhabitants, thus preventing decentralization to municipalities. The only exception is the municipality of Boquete, which manages its own water supply and sanitation system.\n\nThere are approximately 3,300 water supply systems in rural areas, of which 1,800 are managed by \"Juntas Administrativas de Acueductos Rurales\" (JAARs) or Rural Water Boards. The remaining are managed by Health Committees.\n\nIDAAN was created in 1961 and was made responsible for investments in water supply in urban areas and a significant increase in coverage of potable water and - to a lesser extent - sanitation. The institution disposed of high financial capacities and human resources during its first decades. However, IDAAN's financial situation deteriorated significantly due the absence of any tariff increase until 1982.\n\nTo face up IDAAN's weakness, its privatization was proposed at the end of the 1990s, following the telecommunications and electricity sector. At the same time, an agency for economic regulation of public services was created, which is now the ANSP. In 1997, a Water Law was adopted, defining the regulatory and institutional framework for water supply and sanitation.\n\nPrivatization was abandoned until a change of government in 1999. Under Mireya Moscoso's administration, Law 77 was approved to modify the Water Law, permitting privatization and strengthening IDAAN. To significantly increase IDAAN's investments in urban areas, the government decided in 2003 to use financial resources earned through the telecommunication and electricity companies' privatization.\n\nIn 2006, the government of Martín Torrijos established the \"Programa de Desarrollo Comunitario para Infraestructura Pública\" (PRODEC) or Community Development for Public Infrastructure Program (see below).\n\nNeither the tariffs of IDAAN, nor rural tariffs are sufficiently high to cover investment costs. In 2011 IDAAN incurred operating costs (including depreciation) of 131 million Balboas (one Balboa equals one US dollar) and had operating revenues of only 104 million Balboas, resulting in an operating deficit of 27 million Balboas. This was the second-highest annual operating deficit since 1994. Prior to 1994 IDAAN had a small operating surplus in most years. The tariff structure does not provide incentives to save water. Since half of urban and almost all rural users don't dispose of water meters, those users do not receive bills based on consumption.\n\nThose who have meters pay a fixed tariff for the first 8,000 gallons (30 cubic meters) each month in Panama City and for 6,000 gallons (23 cubic meters) in other cities and towns. These consumption levels are far above a basic water need of 50 liter per capita per day which corresponds to 6 cubic meters per month for a family of four. In 2012 the monthly residential water and sewer bill for a consumption of 30 cubic meters was 7.92 Balboas in Panama City (0.26 Cents per cubic meter) and 6.56 Balboas in other cities (0.29 Cents per cubic meter). This compares to USD 3 per cubic meter for residential water use in, for example, Chicago. \n\nAs of 2016, water users had accumulated substantial arrears in water bill payments to IDAAN. The utility is owed $104 million USD in past-due bills, of which $79 million USD is from residential customers, $16 million USD from public agencies and $10 million USD from businesses. IDAAN has disconnected many customers in an effort to secure payments.\n\nIn 2005, IDAAN invested US$49m in urban areas. FIS and MINSA invested a much lower amount in rural areas. The bulk of investments was in water supply, while much less was invested in sanitation. PRODEC aims at investing US$100m of the Panama Canal's gains into community infrastructure, including water supply and sanitation. The use of these funds is decided on a participatory basis through consultative councils at the local level. Furthermore, the National Investment Fund invests in potable water, in particular in rural areas.\n\nThe World Bank supports the sector through a US$32m loan for the Water Supply and Sanitation in Low-Income Communities Project which is executed by the Ministry of Health.\n\nThe Interamerican Development Bank (IDB) supports the sector through various projects. The US$45m Panama City and Bay of Panama Sanitation Project, approved in 2006 and executed by the Ministry of Health, supports the extension of the capital's sanitation network. The sustainable development projects in Darién Province and Bocas del Toro Province include support of water supply and sanitation systems. \n\nThe Japanese Overseas Economic Cooperation Fund (OECF) supports sanitation in the city and the bay of Panama through a loan for constructing a sewage plant.\n\nThe European Investment Bank (EIB) approved a loan to support sanitation in Panama City in 2007.\n\n\n"}

In 2014, he co-authored a review article that found that the United States' legal drinking age of 21 had saved lives since it was raised to that level as a result of a law passed in 1984.\n\nDeJong has been critical of designated driver programs, saying in 1994 that there was no evidence that they were effective. In 2001, when California State University adopted a new set of anti-drinking policies such as treatment programs and advisory boards, DeJong said that this represented a major change from the previous approach most schools used to address drinking on their campuses, which previously focused mainly on communicating messages. He has also said that almost all experts agree that Alcoholics Anonymous is effective, and has harshly criticized the alcoholic beverage industry for, according to him, \"rely to a great extent on underage drinkers and abusive drinkers for the profits that they make.\"\n"}
