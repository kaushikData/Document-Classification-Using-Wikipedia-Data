{"id": "1106093", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1106093", "title": "Chew Valley Lake", "text": "Chew Valley Lake\n\nChew Valley Lake () is a large reservoir in the Chew Valley, Somerset, England, and the fifth-largest artificial lake in the United Kingdom (the largest in south-west England), with an area of 1,200 acres (4.9 km²). The lake, created in the early 1950s and opened by Queen Elizabeth II in 1956, provides much of the drinking water for the city of Bristol and surrounding area, taking its supply from the Mendip Hills. Some of the water from the lake is used to maintain the flow in the River Chew.\n\nBefore the lake was created, archaeological investigations were carried out that showed evidence of occupation since Neolithic times and included Roman artefacts. The lake is an important site for wildlife and has been designated a Site of Special Scientific Interest (SSSI) and a Special Protection Area (SPA). It is a national centre for birdwatching, with over 260 species recorded. The lake has indigenous and migrant water birds throughout the year, and two nature trails have been created. The flora and fauna provide habitats for some less common plants and insects.\n\nSome restricted use for recreational activities is permitted by the owner, Bristol Water, including dinghy sailing and fishing, primarily for trout.\n\nChew Valley Lake is in the Chew Valley at the northern edge of the Mendip Hills, surrounded by meadows and woods and close to the villages of Chew Stoke, Chew Magna and Bishop Sutton. When it was built in the 1950s, its 1,200 acres (4.9 km²) were flooded with 4,500 million imperial gallons (20,000,000 m³) of water from the Mendip hills, with a catchment area of 14,000 acres (57 km²). It is shallow, with an average depth of 14 ft (4 m) at top level and a maximum depth of just 37 ft (11 m). It is fed by small rivers, and it flows into the River Chew for 17 miles (27 km) before it joins the Avon to head out to sea. The deepest part is near the dam and the outlet tower, where the steeply sloping shores of Walley Bank and the north shore result in depths of up to 20 ft (6 m). \"Denny Island\", above the surface throughout the year, is wooded and provides a habitat for wildlife.\n\nThe lake is owned and operated by Bristol Water, which created it in 1956 when the demand became too large for nearby Blagdon Lake. Working with the Avon Wildlife Trust, Somerset Wildlife Trust and other environmental groups, Bristol Water has encouraged various species of birds and plants, and created a venue for visitors.\n\nIt has two landscaped picnic areas. Facilities include a tea shop, with indoor and outdoor seating areas with a view of the lake, and information centre. There are a souvenir shop and small art gallery and two nature trails. The Grebe Trail is a hard-surfaced, all-weather path suitable for pedestrians, pushchairs and wheelchairs and covers a circuit 0.75 miles (1.2 km) long, starting and finishing at the wooded picnic area. The Bittern Trail is reached from the Grebe Trail by the footbridge over Hollow Brook. The grassy path is often waterlogged in winter, but there is a boardwalk over a short section. The trail runs along the east shore, visits an open bird hide and returns to the footbridge, making a 1-mile (1.5-kilometre) circuit. Bristol Water imposes conditions on visitors, particularly related to the areas where dogs are allowed.\n\nAccess to the waterside is restricted in places to reduce the disruption to wildlife. Paths around the lake are generally flat and, where paths are surfaced, wheelchair access is possible.\n\nVisitors are officially invited to use public transport, but overwhelmingly arrive by private car, encouraged by the provision of parking spaces. The \"Chew Valley Explorer\" bus route 672/674 provides access.\n\nIn 2002 a 1.9-mile (3-kilometre) safe cycle route, the Chew Lake West Green Route, was opened along the B3114 on the western part of the lake. It forms part of the Padstow to Bristol West Country Way, National Cycle Network Route 3. It has all-weather surfacing, providing a smooth off-road facility for ramblers, mobility-challenged visitors and cyclists of all abilities. It was funded by Bath and North East Somerset Council with the support of Sustrans and the Chew Valley Recreational Trail Association. Minor roads around the lake are also frequently used by cyclists.\n\nBristol Airport is approximately 10 miles (15 km) away. The nearest major road is the A368, which runs along the southern edge of the lake and provides access from Bath and Weston super Mare. The A37 and A38 are slightly further away, providing access from Bristol. Car parking is available at the visitor centre and Woodford Lodge, for which a charge is made, and a small amount of parking is available at points around the lake; some of these are restricted to those with fishing permits.\n\nThe area the lake covers was once rich farmland. Farms and houses had to be removed before the land was flooded, and old roads, hedgerows and tree stumps can reappear when dry summers cause the level of the lake to drop. Prior to the flooding of the reservoir, archaeological excavations were carried out by Philip Rahtz and Ernest Greenfield employed by the Ministry of Works, from 1953 to 1955. The excavations found evidence of people belonging to the consecutive periods known as Upper Palaeolithic, Mesolithic and Neolithic (Old, Middle and New Stone Age), Bronze Age and Iron Age, including implements such as stone knives, flint blades and the head of a mace, along with buildings and graves. The artefacts from this period are held at Bristol City Museum and Art Gallery. Further evidence of Neolithic and Bronze Age occupation is provided by the archaeological survey of the Mendip Hills Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty.\nExcavations have also uncovered Roman remains, indicating agricultural and industrial activity from the second half of the first century to third century AD. The finds included a villa at Chew Park where wooden writing tablets (the first in the UK) with ink writing were found. The tablets were sent to the British Museum, but other Roman material is on display at the Bristol City Museum and Art Gallery with the lake's other historical artefacts.\n\nFurther excavations around the village of Moreton, which has now been totally submerged, found evidence of a thriving community in medieval times and possibly the remains of the Nunnery of Santa Cruz. During the Middle Ages farming was the most important activity in the area covered by the lake, supported by four flour mills powered by the River Chew. Stratford Mill was demolished and re-erected in the grounds of Blaise Castle Museum, in north-west Bristol. The largest settlement was Moreton, which is listed in the Domesday Book and survived until the flooding of the lake, when the remains of the Moreton Cross were moved to Chew Stoke Parish Church. There is evidence of lime kilns, which were used in the production of mortar for the construction of local churches. Farming, both arable and dairy, continued until the flooding of the lake, with most households also keeping pigs. There were orchards for fruit production, including apples, pears and plums. Moreton was also the site of gunpowder mill in the 18th century.\n\nPlans for the building of the reservoir were under discussion before the Second World War, and an Act of Parliament submitted by the Bristol Waterworks Company was passed in 1939. Following this, farms were bought by the company and farmed by the previous owners as tenancies. Farms and buildings still remaining in private hands were acquired by compulsory purchase. The sanction for construction was given in 1949 and the contract awarded to A.E. Farr, who employed 300 people on the site. The main dam was stabilised by injecting concrete into the cracks in the bedrock. The core of the dam was made of puddled clay mixed with sand. This was the first time the gain in strength brought about by the use of sand drains had been quantified. The lake was inaugurated by Queen Elizabeth II, accompanied by Prince Philip, with the unveiling of a commemorative stone and plaque, which can be seen from the dam, on 17 April 1956, although it was not full until 25 February 1958. Flowers were presented to the Queen at the opening of Chew Valley Lake by Judith Blair Brown, daughter of Kennedy Brown, who worked at Bristol Water Works at the time of construction of the lake.\n\nDuring the storm of 10 July 1968, the lake gained an extra 471 million imperial gallons (2,140,000 m³) and rose 19 inches (480 mm) in under 12 hours. At one point worried Bristol police issued a warning that the dam might not hold, prompting localised evacuation of populated valley areas downstream including Pensford and Keynsham.\n\nThe lake is designated a Site of Special Scientific Interest (SSSI) and a Special Protection Area (SPA) (Site Code: UK9010041) largely because of the diversity of species and habitats. Providing further protection, much of the area around the lake also falls within the Mendip Hills Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty (AONB).\n\nThe lake appears to have a higher sedimentation rate than would be expected in other similar reservoirs, being in the region of 100–150 t.km.yr.\n\nThe main geological outcrops around the lake are mudstone, largely consisting of red siltstone resulting in the underlying characteristic of the gently rolling valley landscape. Bands of sandstone from the Triassic period contribute to the undulating character of the area. There are also more recent alluvial deposits beside the course of the River Chew.\n\nOver 260 species of birds have been recorded at Chew, an internationally important site for wintering and migrating wildfowl. From late July to February, up to 4,000 ducks (Anatidae) of twelve different species may be present, including internationally important numbers of northern shoveler (\"Anas clypeata\") and gadwall (\"Anas strepera\"). Up to 600 great crested grebes (\"Podiceps cristatus\") gather to moult on the lake in autumn. Data on bird species and their numbers on the lake, dating back to the first \"ringing\" in 1964, is available from the Chew Valley Ringing Station.\n\nNumerous other birds can be seen, especially during the spring and autumn migration. Sand martins (\"Riparia riparia\") arrive early and can usually be seen hawking over the water for insects in the second or third week of March. Flocks of tits (Paridae), swallows (Hirundinidae) and terns (Sternidae) can regularly be seen. Waders, such as lapwings (\"Vanellus vanellus\"), dunlin (\"Calidris alpina\") and common snipe (\"Gallinago gallinago\"), are attracted to the muddy shores if the water level drops in autumn. By midwinter up to 55,000 gulls, mostly black-headed gull (\"Chroicocephalus ridibundus\") and common gull (\"Larus canus\"), may be roosting. Good numbers of reed warblers (\"Acrocephalus scirpaceus\") and sedge warblers (\"A. schoenobaenus\") nest in the fringing reeds, along with grebes (Podicipedidae) and Eurasian coots (\"Fulica atra\").\n\nMuch of the management work carried out in the nature reserve is aimed at encouraging ducks to breed, and small numbers of tufted duck (\"Aythya fuligula\"), common pochard (\"Aythya ferina\"), common shelduck (\"Tadorna tadorna\") and gadwall raise broods most years. Recent breeding successes also include water rail (\"Rallus aquaticus\") and Cetti's warbler (\"Cettia cetti\").\n\nA wetland reserve has been created at Heron's Green Pool on the opposite side of the causeway to the lake. A shallow pool fringed with sedges (Cyperaceae), rushes (Juncaceae) and reedgrasses (\"Calamagrostis\") and surrounded by lightly grazed, rough grassland may also prove attractive to snipe and lapwings.\n\nIn late summer large shoals of roach (\"Rutilus rutilus\") and perch (\"Perca fluviatilis\") fry congregate around the margins and weed beds, which are predated by the brown trout (\"Salmo trutta\" morpha \"fario\") and rainbow trout (\"Oncorhynchus mykiss\"). Chew Valley also holds a large population of pike (\"Esox lucius\"), and fishing for these is permitted at certain times of the year.\n\nAquatic midges (Chironomidae) provide the highest proportion of the fly life of the lake. The trout (Salmonidae) will feed at the surface on these and water boatmen (Corixidae), and below the surface on the caddisfly (Trichoptera) larvae and pupae; they will also take the adult caddisflies when they emerge. Other aquatic fauna including \"daphnia\" and snails are also found in the lake. Large populations of dragonflies, including migrant hawker (\"Aeshna mixta\") and significant numbers of ruddy darter (\"Sympetrum sanguineum\"), occur at the lake. Eleven species of wainscot moth make their home in the reed beds, including the nationally local brown-veined wainscot (\"Archanara dissoluta\"), twin-spotted wainscot (\"Archanara geminipuncta\") and silky wainscot (\"Chilodes maritimus\").\n\nThe lake is surrounded with fringing reedbeds, carr woodland and grassland, which are managed by Bristol Water. The water conditions are eutrophic with run off from local fields and streams. Open-water plant communities are rather sparse, largely comprising fennel pondweed (\"Potamogeton pectinatus\"), lesser pondweed (\"Potamogeton pusillus\"), opposite-leaved pondweed (\"Groenlandia densa\") and water-crowfoot (\"Ranunculus spp.\"). On neutral soils around the reservoir, pepper-saxifrage (\"Silaum silaus\"), burnet-saxifrage (\"Pimpinella saxifraga\") and devil's-bit scabious (\"Succisa pratensis\") occur, and on calcareous soils fairy flax (\"Linum catharticum\"), dwarf thistle (\"Cirsium acaule\") and salad burnet (\"Sanguisorba minor\" subspecies \"minor\") are found.\n\nThe small and medium-sized fields around the lake are generally bounded by hedges and occasionally by tree belts and woodland, some of which date back to the most evident period of enclosure of earlier open fields which took place in the late medieval period. Mature oak (\"Quercus\") and ash (\"Fraxinus excelsior\") trees are characteristic of the area with occasional groups of Scots pine (\"Pinus sylvestris\") and chestnuts (\"Castanea sativa\"). Many elm (\"Ulmus\") trees have been lost in this area, and dead/dying elms are also evident in the surrounding landscape.\n\nFour areas of woodland containing 157 trees has been planted by The Life for a Life Charity around the lake on the Restaurant side, for the cremated remains of loved ones to be placed beneath them. These forests contain Scots pine (\"Pinus sylvestris\"), English oak (\"Quercus robur\"), rowan (\"Sorbus aucuparia\") and the silver birch (\"Betula pendula\").\n\nThe lake is used for a wide variety of leisure pursuits.\n\nDuring 2005–2006 Bristol Water started restoring two artificial islands. These are intended to provide safe nesting and roosting sites for a range of wildfowl. Permits to enter the reservoir enclosure and to use the access roads, paths and bird hides are available (for a fee) only to members of ornithological and naturalist societies recognised by Bristol Water. They can be obtained from Woodford Lodge and include conditions of use imposed by the owners.\n\nChew Valley Lake Sailing Club has a sailing area, approximately 1.9 miles (3 km) long, for dinghy sailing. The lake is divided into two areas: a restricted summer area which is available during the fishing season (mid-March to mid-October), and the full area which can be used throughout the winter and on Sunday afternoons. The sailing area is marked out by lines of small white buoys. Racing marks are red buoys with flags, although large inflatable marks are used of open events.\n\nThe club can cater for fleets of over one hundred boats and it hosts large national events. Normal club racing has fleet starts for the following dinghy classes: Flying Fifteen (keelboat), Laser (dinghy), Solo (dinghy) and Topper (dinghy) as well as a handicap fleet run under the Portsmouth yardstick scheme. Five slipways enable easy launching. Off the water, the clubhouse facilities include large changing rooms, hot showers, hot food at the weekends, a bar and terrace overlooking the lake. The club caters for disabled people with facilities on both floors and a lift. Royal Yachting Association sailing courses are held at the club for members including race training, youth training, powerboat training, race officer training as well as more informal training run within each fleet.\n\nSeasonal day and afternoon bank fishing permits are available at Woodford Lodge. The restrictions imposed by Bristol Water mean that no fishing is allowed from the dams or stone embankments, the sailing club, in front of Stratford bird hide, in front of the picnic areas and in the nature reserve. There is a fleet of 32 motor boats for hire to fish.\n\n\n"}

The amino-acid sequence of CSP consists of an immunodominant central repeat region flanked by conserved motifs at the N- and C- termini that are implicated in protein processing as the parasite travels from the mosquito to the mammalian vector.\n\nThe structure and function of CSP is highly conserved across the various strains of malaria that infect humans, non-human primates and rodents. It can first be detected in large quantities as sporozoites are forming within oocysts residing in the midgut walls of infected mosquitoes. Upon egression from mature oocysts, sporozoites begin migrating to the salivary glands, and CSP is known to be an important mediator of this process. Additionally, CSP is involved in hepatocyte binding in the mammalian host. Here, the N-terminus and central repeat region initially facilitate parasite binding. On the hepatocyte surface proteolytic cleavage at region 1 of the N-terminus exposes the adhesive domain of the C-terminus, thereby priming the parasites for invasion of the liver.\n\nCSP is an approximately 42 kD soluble protein and can readily be made using an \"E. coli\" expression system.\n"}

This element of the act was implemented in stages as definitive maps of different regions were produced. The act refers to areas of 'mountain, moor, heath and down' in addition to registered common land; not all uncultivated land is covered.\nA staged review of public rights of way, including limited rights to create new public footpaths where needed, is being conducted under the Act. Again, this is being conducted in a staged manner, which can produce anomalies – of the two administrative areas of the County of Gloucestershire, South Gloucestershire was revised in the Southern area and the rest of Gloucestershire in the Midlands.\n\nSome long-standing areas of dispute became accessible under the Act — these include Chrome Hill and Parkhouse Hill in the Peak District.\n\nThe Countryside and Rights of Way Act also made some changes in respect of nature conservation, in particular to Part I of the Wildlife and Countryside Act 1981. The three main changes are: the maximum penalty is now a term of imprisonment instead of a fine; the Secretary of State can designate \"wildlife inspectors\" who have a range of powers under the Act; offences of disturbing certain birds and animals are extended so as to cover reckless as well as intentional acts.\n\nThe act gave power to create local access forums (commonly referred to as 'LAFs'), comprising a balance of user, landowner and other interests, to give advice on development of access land and of the path network; the policy of footpath improvement would be set out in a Rights of Way Improvement Plan (RoWIP). (see for example http://www.jlaf.org.uk which covers a large part of the former Avon area).\n\nA more ambitious Land Reform (Scotland) Act 2003 was enacted by the Scottish Parliament which formalised the Scottish tradition of unhindered access to open countryside, provided that care is taken not to cause damage or interfere with activities including farming and game stalking.\n\n\n"}

Pronouncing words is impossible without first learning to pronounce the vowels and consonants that make them up (hence babies' babbling).\n\nThis is an essential cognitive capacity, allowing prior development to produce new foundations for further cognitive development. Cumulative learning consolidates the knowledge one has obtained through experiences, allowing it to be reproduced and exploited for subsequent learning situations through cumulative interaction between prior knowledge and new information.\n\nArguably, all learning is cumulative learning, as all learning depends on previous learning (except skills that are innate, such as breathing, swallowing, gripping etc).\n"}

J. Anderson from Guy’s Hospital Medical School, described the idea of manipulating occlusion by inducing over-eruption. This was achieved by placing bite-raising caps on certain teeth in the arch and observing the changes in distances between other teeth of opposing arches.\n\nHowever, in 1975, Bjørn L. Dahl from the Faculty of Dentistry of University of Oslo became the first author through a series of papers to report the successful use of the technique for the management of the worn dentition. Dahl, along with Olaf Krogstad and Kjell Karlsen, described this phenomenon where a Dahl appliance or anterior bite plane is used to increase the available interocclusal space available for restorations.\n\nA male, 18 year old patient with heavy wear on the palatal aspect of his dentition and no interproximal contacts in the anterior teeth was the subject of the experiment. A removable cobalt chromium platform was worn, which covered the upper palatal surface of the anterior teeth, while being held in place by clasps in the canine and premolar region. The appliance was worn for 24 hours each day over a 12 month period except for cleaning after every meal. This caused the premolars and molars of the patient to be propped open with the anterior teeth occluding the appliance.\n\nThe Dahl concept is commonly used when an increase in the interocclusal space is required together with an increase in occlusal vertical dimension ; for example when restoring a case of severe anterior tooth surface loss. Typically, restoring the worn anterior teeth with dental composite to the original proportions will result in an increase in OVD, with the posterior dentition held apart out of the occlusion.\n\nAdaptation occurs over a period of some months: compensatory eruption of the posterior teeth will occur, together with some intrusion of the anterior teeth and potential growth of the alveolar bone. This will allow the posterior occlusion to reestablish at the new increased OVD, stabilizing the increased interocclusal space.\n\nDentoalveolar tissues tend to compensate by remodelling when incisal/occlusal tooth surface loss has occurred to allow the teeth to regain a functional occlusion. A subsequent increase in the OVD with the Dahl approach could exceed the patient's tolerance and adaptive capacity. If the patient is unhappy with the height of their teeth and a Dahl approach cannot be tolerated then crown lengthening may be appropriate.\n\nThe original material used to construct Dahl's appliance was cobalt chromium. Now, many materials can be used to construct Dahl's appliance as long as the principles of technique are adhered to. A Dahl appliance should fulfil the following aims:\n\nThe advantages of this approach are:\n\nPlanned occlusal changes can be tested using a removable appliance prior to permanent treatment. Dental composite based approaches to tooth surface loss allow for easy adjustment or removal if required. One study published in the British Dental Journal, 2011 found that patient satisfaction was high when composite restorations were used in the Dahl approach and that the median survival time was between 4.75 and 5.8 years.\n\n"}

CBM, Sightsavers and WAHO arranged to build a new facility in the teaching hospital compound, which was opened on 9 April 2010.\n\nA 1989 study found that maternal mortality at the hospital was 12.47 per 1,000, an extremely high figure.\nCauses include lack of primary health care or peripheral obstetrical services, poor training of nurses and midwives and lack of general health education among the public.\nIn March 2011, the general wardroom for pre-mature babies in the Maternity Center had four incubators, but only one was working. It held five babies. The center is not equipped to handle the demand. About 80% of premature babies die within a few days.\n\nThe Donka Hospital Institute of Nutrition and Child Health is the only children's hospital in Conakry.\nBetween January and the end of September 2006, 623 malnourished children were admitted, a significant increase over previous years. The \"dark, airless wards\" were overcrowded, with some children sleeping two to a bed.\n\nThe hospital's dialysis department has five dialysis machines and can only treat 21 patients. There are private dialysis centers, but most patients cannot pay the $100 cost of the treatment.\nThe Donka hospital provides training for mass marketing, communication and marketing aspects of prevention of HIV/AIDS, funded by the World Bank and other sources.\n\nThe hospital has built up debt over the years, and cannot persuade the government or aid agencies to help with repayments.\nIt therefore enforces a rigorous pay-as-you-go policy, which puts treatment and drugs out of reach of many poor people.\nNew patients must first be tested for life-threatening illnesses such as tuberculosis, AIDS, cholera, malaria and cancer.\nThe cost of a measles vaccine is as low as US$1.\n\nSince many Guineans do not have enough money to pay for the blood test, they cannot get medical attention at the hospital.\nThe director of the hospital, Dr Taibou Barry, acknowledged the problem in 2003, saying: \"The families are poor and when they come to the hospital, they have to pay for everything, and that’s probably all the money they have, so they must choose to eat or to come to the hospital\".\n\nA 2008 report from IRIN described the case of Aboubacar Traoré, who took his two-year-old daughter to the hospital for emergency medical treatment. Although the fee for consultation was $5, as shown on a sign on the wall, the doctor demanded more. \nAnother doctor at the hospital said she was not surprised. She said \"I have seen colleagues here persuade patients that only they can treat them, and once the patient has gained trust in that doctor, he or she bribes the patient\".\n\nAt the start of 2007, strikes and protests were called due to rising commodity prices and falling living standards, coupled with pervasive corruption and political unrest. In the ensuing violence, about 180 people died and over 1,000 were injured. \nThe International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) provided six vehicles to take wounded people to Donka Hospital on 22 January 2007.\n119 patients were admitted, most with bullet wounds. \nThe ICRC supplied a surgical kit for treating up to 150 gunshot victims to the hospital.\nDonka hospital cared for at least 800 wounded people, assisted by Médecins Sans Frontières.\nAccording to Djoulde Barry, director general of the hospital, 33 dead were registered there.\n\nOn 28 September 2009 a demonstration against the military junta at a city stadium was violently suppressed by security forces, with dozens of deaths and hundreds of injuries.\nWomen reported that soldiers had raped them in public in the stadium. Medical records from Donka Hospital showed that at least 32 of the women protesters were raped.\nMore than 220 first aid workers from the Red Cross Society of Guinea gave emergency medical assistance to more than 350 wounded people and took the most serious cases to the hospitals, mostly to the Donka National Hospital.\nThe injured packed the emergency room. Military from the Presidential Guard and Anti-Drug and Anti-Organized Crime Unit showed up around 3:00 pm that day. They fired their rifles into the air, destroyed medicines and yelled at the wounded to leave the hospital. They prevented anyone else from entering the building. The register of people treated was later lost.\n\nFollowing the 28 September violence, the ICRC gave essential medical and surgical items to Conakry's hospitals, including kits to treat bullet wounds, masks, gloves and saline solution, and also provided body bags.\nThe ICRC and the Red Cross Society of Guinea tried to reunite family members, particularly children, who had been separated in the violence.\nThe NGO Terre des hommes was providing meals to patients in the Hospital, with the Health Ministry and private donations assisting in the supply of food. \nAs follow-up to the violence, the ICRC helped Donka Hospital revise its emergency plan for handling a large influx of patients with bullet wounds.\n\nFurther violence occurred before the October 2010 Presidential run-off elections. \nSupporters of the candidate Cellou Dalein Diallo of the Union of Democratic Forces of Guinea threw stones at police, who responded with gunfire. Two people were killed and at least 29 people were injured, treated in private clinics or Donka Hospital. The victims included \"13 adolescents and three young girls\".\nViolence continued after the elections, which were disputed.\nOn 16 November 2010, Donka hospital reported treating 30 gunshot wounds, mostly direct shots rather than from stray bullets.\n\nThe bleak conditions in the hospital were the subject of a 1996 documentary \"Donka, radioscopie d'un hôpital africain\" by the Belgian director Thierry Michel.\nOn 27 January 2009, a group of Marines from the U.S. Embassy delivered toys to each of the children at the Pediatric Hospital.\nThe actress Mia Farrow, who serves as a UNICEF Goodwill Ambassador, visited the hospital in May 2010.\nShe saw three newborn infants in one incubator in the maternity ward. \nShe met mothers of severely malnourished children, and saw children fighting measles and other preventable childhood killer diseases.\nShe said \"It is wrenching to watch a child dying of a disease that is completely preventable. This is a result of Guinea's failing health system\".\n\n"}

After three and a half years weathering the harsh winters and high altitude of Colorado while a student at the University of Denver, Danny returned home to Chicago to focus on his health. While training for the 2006 Accenture Triathlon, Danny came up with the idea to create the Fight Forever Foundation. Founded by Danny Ferrone and two of his close friends, the Foundation's immediate fundraising efforts were centered on a campaign which involved Danny competing in triathlon and marathon events which were supposed to culminate in the Ironman World Championship in Kona, Hawaii in 2008. Danny, with his limited lung capacity around 50%, finished marathons in Las Vegas, Los Angeles, and Chicago, and the Accenture Triathlon in Chicago, twice, over the two-year campaign. However, his goal of qualifying for the Ironman World Championship fell short after a hard-fought performance at the qualifying Buffalo Springs Lake triathlon event in Lubbock, Texas in June 2008, where his time of 5 hours, 48 minutes failed to land him a spot in Kona.\n\nNever willing to give in, Danny is currently in Milan, Italy working together with the Italian Cystic Fibrosis Research Foundation and researchers throughout Europe, while continuing his training to compete in more marathons and triathlons.

{"id": "86531", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=86531", "title": "Grannus", "text": "Grannus\n\nIn the Celtic polytheism of classical antiquity, Grannus (also \"Granus\", \"Mogounus,\" and \"Amarcolitanus\") was a deity associated with spas, healing thermal and mineral springs, and the sun. He was regularly identified with Apollo as Apollo Grannus. He was frequently worshipped in conjunction with Sirona, and sometimes with Mars and other deities.\n\nIn the early twentieth century, the name was connected with the Irish \"grian\", ‘sun’. Along these lines, the god was often linked to the Deò-ghrèine and the character Mac Gréine of Irish mythology. However, the Irish \"grian\", ‘sun’ is thought to be derived from Proto-Celtic *\"greinā\" ‘sun’ and the Proto-Celtic *\"greinā\" is unlikely to have developed into \"Grannos\" in Gaulish and other Continental Celtic languages. Derivation from a Proto-Celtic root *\"granno-\" ‘beard’ (cf. Middle Welsh \"grann\" ‘chin; beard, hairs’ and Old Irish \"grend\" ‘beard, hairs’) has enjoyed some scholarly support, from which Jürgen Zeidler dissents, proposing a different root *\"granno-\" with \"probable reference to the sun's heat and healing properties\".\nRanko Matasović, in his \"Etymological Dictionary of Proto-Celtic\", has tentatively proposed that the root of this theonym comes from Proto-Celtic *\"grenso\"-, which means \"heat\"; however, Proto-Celtic initial \"g-\" yields \"b-\" in Gaulish (cf. the name Brennus).\n\nAt Monthelon, Grannus is called \"Deus Apollo Grannus Amarcolitanus\" (\"The one with a piercing or far-reaching look\"), and at Horbourg-Wihr \"Apollo Grannus Mogounus\".\n\nIn all of his centres of worship where he is assimilated to a Roman god, Grannus was identified with Apollo, presumably in Apollo’s role as a healing or solar deity. In Trier, he is identified more specifically with Phoebus as Apollo Grannus Phoebus.\n\nOne of the god’s most famous cult centres was at Aquae Granni (now Aachen, Germany). Aachen means ‘water’ in Old High German, a calque of the Roman name of \"Aquae Granni\". The town’s hot springs with temperatures between 45 °C and 75 °C lay in the somewhat inhospitably marshy area around Aachen's basin-shaped valley region. Aachen first became a curative centre in Hallstatt times. \n\nAccording to Cassius Dio, the Roman Emperor Caracalla (188 AD to 217 AD) unsuccessfully sought help from Apollo Grannus—as well as Aesculapius and Serapis—during a bout of physical and mental illness, visiting the god's shrine and making many votive offerings; Dio claims that the gods refused to heal him because they knew Caracalla's intentions to be evil. Caracalla's visit to the shrine of ‘the Celtic healing-god’ Grannus was during the war with Germany in about 215.\n\nIn the early twentieth century, the god was said to have still been remembered in a chant sung round bonfires in Auvergne, in which a grain sheaf is set on fire, and called \"Granno mio\", while the people sing, “Granno, my friend; Granno, my father; Granno, my mother”. However, \"granno\" may simply be a derivative of an Occitan word of Latin origin meaning \"grain\" (compare Auvergnat \"gran\" \"grain\", \"grana\" \"seed\" and Languedocien \"grano\", from Latin \"grānum\" \"grain\").\n\nA 1st century AD Latin inscription from a public fountain in Limoges mentions a Gaulish ten-night festival of Grannus (lightly Latinized as \"decamnoctiacis Granni\"):\n\nTranslation: \"The vergobretus Postumus son of Dumnorix gave from his own money the \"Aqua Martia\" (\"Water of Martius [or Mars]\", an aqueduct) for the ten-night festival of Grannus\".\n\nThe name Grannus is sometimes accompanied by those of other deities in the inscriptions. In Augsburg, he is found with both Diana and Sirona; he is again invoked with Sirona at Rome, Bitburg, Baumberg, Lauingen, and Sarmizegetusa (twice). At Ennetach he is with Nymphs, at Faimingen with Hygieia and the Mother of the Gods, and at Grand with Sol. A votive altar at Astorga invokes him after \"holy Serapis\" and \"the many-named Isis\", and before \"the unvanquished Core and Mars Sagatus\". \n"}
{"id": "339747", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=339747", "title": "Gutta-percha", "text": "Gutta-percha\n\nGutta-percha refers to trees of the genus \"Palaquium\" in the family Sapotaceae and the rigid natural latex produced from the sap of these trees, particularly from \"Palaquium gutta\".\n\nThe word \"gutta-percha\" comes from the plant's name in Malay, \"getah perca\", which translates as \"percha latex\".\n\nPalaquium gutta trees are 5–30 m tall and up to 1 m in trunk diameter. The leaves are evergreen, alternate or spirally arranged, simple, entire, 8–25 cm long, glossy green above, and often yellow or glaucous below. The flowers are produced in small clusters along the stems, each flower with a white corolla with four to seven (mostly six) acute lobes. The fruit is an ovoid 3– to 7-cm berry, containing one to four seeds; in many species, the fruit is edible.\n\nIn Australia, gutta-percha is a common name specifically used for the euphorbiaceous tree \"Excoecaria parvifolia\", which yields an aromatic, heavy, dark-brown timber.\n\nChemically, gutta-percha is a polyterpene, a polymer of isoprene, or polyisoprene, specifically (trans-1,4-polyisoprene). The cis structure of polyisoprene is the common latex elastomer. While latex rubbers are amorphous in molecular structure, gutta-percha (the trans structure) crystallizes, leading to a more rigid material.\n\nScientifically classified in 1843, it was found to be a useful natural thermoplastic. In 1851, of gutta-percha was imported into Britain.\n\nDuring the second half of the 19th century, gutta-percha was used for myriad domestic and industrial purposes, and it became a household word. In particular, it was needed as insulation for underwater telegraph cables, which, according to author John Tully, led to unsustainable harvesting and a collapse of the supply.\n\nAccording to Harvey Wickes Felter and John Uri Lloyd's \"Endodontology\": \n\nGutta-percha latex is biologically inert, resilient, and is a good electrical insulator with a high dielectric strength. The wood of many species is also valuable.\n\nWestern inventors discovered the properties of gutta-percha latex in 1842, although the people of its Malayan habitat had used it for many applications for centuries. Allowing this fluid to evaporate and coagulate in the sun produced a latex which could be made flexible again with hot water, but which did not become brittle, unlike rubber prior to the discovery of vulcanization.\n\nBy 1845, telegraph wires insulated with gutta-percha were being manufactured in the UK. It served as the insulating material for early undersea telegraph cables, including the first transatlantic telegraph cable. Gutta-percha was particularly suitable for this, as it was not attacked by marine plants or animals, which had disabled previous undersea cables. The material was a major constituent of Chatterton's compound used as an insulating sealant for telegraph and other electrical cables.\n\nSince about 1930, polyethylene has supplanted gutta-percha as an electrical insulator.\n\nIn the mid-19th century, gutta-percha was also used to make furniture, notably by the Gutta-Percha Company (established in 1847). Several of these ornate, revival-style pieces were shown at the 1851 Great Exhibition in Hyde Park, London. When hot it could be moulded into furniture, decorations or utensils.\n\nIt was also used to make \"mourning\" jewelry, because it was dark in color and could be easily molded into beads or other shapes. Pistol hand grips and rifle shoulder pads were also made from gutta-percha, since it was hard and durable, though it fell into disuse when plastics such as Bakelite became available. Gutta-percha found use in canes and walking sticks, as well.\n\nThe material was adopted for other applications. The \"guttie\" golf ball (which had a solid gutta-percha core) revolutionized the game. Gutta-percha remained an industrial staple well into the 20th Century, when it was gradually replaced with superior (generally synthetic) materials, though a similar and cheaper natural material called \"balatá\" is often used in gutta-percha's place. The two materials are almost identical, and \"balatá \"is often called \"gutta-balatá\".\n\nIn 1856, United States Representative Preston Brooks used a cane made of gutta-percha as a weapon in his attack on Senator Charles Sumner.\n\nThe same bioinertness that made it suitable for marine cables also means it does not readily react within the human body. It is used in a variety of surgical devices and during root canal therapy. It is the predominant material used to obturate, or fill the empty space inside the root of a tooth after it has undergone endodontic therapy. Its physical and chemical properties, including but not limited to its inertness and biocompatibility, melting point, ductility, and malleability, make it important in endodontics, e.g. as gutta-percha points.\n\nMysterious blocks, about the size of a chopping-board, bearing the name \"Tjipetir\" (a plantation in the Dutch East Indies - now Indonesia - operating in the late 19th and early 20th centuries), have been washing up on the beaches of northern Europe for some time through 2013 and 2014. They are believed to be blocks of gutta-percha from the Japanese liner the Miyazaki Maru, which sank 150 miles (241.5 km) west of the Isles of Scilly during WWI.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "32054390", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=32054390", "title": "Günther Messner", "text": "Günther Messner\n\nGünther Messner (18 May 1946 – 29 June 1970) was an Italian mountaineer from South Tyrol and the younger brother of Reinhold Messner. Günther climbed some of the most difficult routes in the Alps during the 1960s, and joined the Nanga Parbat-Expedition in 1970 just before the beginning of the expedition due to an opening within the team.\n\nGünther was a member of a 1970 expedition to Nanga Parbat led by . Herrligkoffer had already organized six expeditions to Nanga Parbat and was said to be obsessed with the mountain after his half-brother, climber Willy Merkl, along with eight others, died on the peak in 1934.\n\nOn 26 June 1970 Reinhold, Günther and Gerhard were at Camp 5 watching for a signal rocket from base camp. Blue indicated good weather, red poor. Radio Peshawar reported good weather, so the expedition leader Herrligkoffer fired a rocket, but it exploded red, not blue. Consequently, Reinhold commenced a solo quick-and-light attack without gear shortly after 2 a.m. to avoid the presumed bad weather. Günther and Gerhard were still asleep. Reinhold had a difficult time finding his way up the Merkl Couloir by headlamp but emerged at dawn. At sunrise the next morning, Günther and were installing rope to aid Reinhold's return. Baur recounts the story that Günther did something impulsive in that he impatiently dumped the ropes they were fixing and sprinted into and then soloed the difficult Merkl Couloir. Günther and Reinhold reached the summit together late in the afternoon, when Günther started showing signs of exhaustion, possibly due to the effort he made in trying to catch up with Reinhold earlier in the day.\n\nWhat happened next was a matter of controversy for many years. According to Reinhold Messner, the two brothers stayed near the summit overnight in an emergency bivouac (with only space blankets) close to the so-called Merkle-notch (named in honor of Herrligkoffer's half brother) since a night descent seemed impossible on the Rupal face due to Günther's exhaustion and altitude sickness. Reinhold states that Günther worried that reversing down the sheer Rupal Face would be dangerous. He says that Günther suggested a descent via the gentler Diamir Face.\n\nThe next morning, Reinhold recalls that Günther was delirious. Reinhold says that he started shouting for help at 6 a.m. and about three hours later, he saw and in the Merkl Couloir, heading for the summit. The two parties got to within about 100 yards of each other and with difficulty there was some communication. \"Are you both OK?\" Kuen yelled. \"Yes! Everything's OK,\" Reinhold controversially replied. Unfortunately in a misunderstanding Kuen and Scholz continued to the summit. Reinhold and Günther were then forced to do a second bivouac at the Mummery Rib. By the next morning, the third day without shelter or water, Günther could only stumble slowly along. The multi-day descent had brought the two climbers to the limit of their physical and mental strength, and was to end in tragedy when Günther disappeared at the bottom of the Diamir face, most likely killed by an ice avalanche during the descent. Reinhold, walking ahead and facing exhaustion, severe frostbite and the loss of his brother, continued down along the Diamir valley until he found some local shepherds that helped him.\nThe expedition members Max von Kienlin and Hans Saler claimed that Reinhold declined the assistance of others when his brother Günther became ill. The main assertion by Hans Saler and Max von Kienlin was that Reinhold's decision to go down the Diamir face was not born of emergency, as suggested by Günther in his fatigue, but a gambit Reinhold had planned and had openly discussed with members of the team. Messner's version of events was that \"He (Günther) had to get lower. We couldn't continue along the southwest ridge either, because it is very long and up and down. And we couldn't wait for the others to come, because they couldn't have gotten to us until the following morning, and another day and night at that altitude would have been fatal for Günther. That left only the Diamir Face\". Messner was subsequently widely quoted as saying \"We had a choice between waiting for death and going out to meet it\".\n\nFor the next 30 years the dispute over the events of this expedition became possibly the most controversial fight in modern-day climbing. The dispute spawned more than a dozen lawsuits, countless attacks and counterattacks, a revenge theory (stemming from a post-expedition love affair between Messner and von Kienlin's wife), and numerous efforts by Messner to find Günther and vindicate himself.\n\nIn July 2000, climber found a human fibula at the base of the Diamir wall of Nanga Parbat. Due to the decomposition of the DNA, it could not be definitively determined at that time whether the bone belonged to Günther Messner - it was possible that the bone could have come from climbers who died on the mountain in 1962. A subsequent analysis at the University of Innsbruck strongly suggested that the owner of the fibula was Günther Messner.\nOn 17 July 2005, three local Pakistani guides found the remains of a climber at an altitude of 4,300 metres on the Diamir face an hour's climb above the Diamir base camp, near where Reinhold had believed Günther was lost. A search of the talus yielded a leather boot entombing a wool-socked foot and clothing which the climbers quickly realized could be the body of Günther Messner. Reinhold trekked to the spot and recognised the boot (a brown leather Lowa Triple Boot) and jacket on the body as those of his brother. Reinhold took the boot with him - with the bones still inside. The expedition doctor, Munich-based anesthesiologist Rudolf Hipp, harvested tissue samples for the DNA testing.\n\nOn 21 October 2005 scientists at the University of Innsbruck completed a DNA analysis of tissue samples from the remains, and confirmed that the remains were that of Günther. This evidence vindicated the version of events told by Reinhold that Günther was on the west side of the mountain when he was killed, and not on the descent through the Rupal Wall.\n\nDespite the undisputed DNA evidence controversy persists. Residual argument revolves largely around whether Günther perished in a fall near the summit, upper or middle part of the Diamir Face, versus toward the bottom, where Reinhold said he'd last seen his brother. The argument is based on glacial movement over a period of 35 years and the location where the remains were found. Saler has asserted that if Günther had died in the lower third of the face (as described by Reinhold) then the remains would have been found much lower than 14,110 feet (where they were reportedly recovered). The existence of a disputed handwritten note described in the 2003 book by von Kienlin, \"The Traverse\", was allegedly a \"confession\" recorded by von Kienlin documenting a conversation between Reinhold and von Kienlin in a motel room in Gilgit, Pakistan, before they both returned home. The note says that \"I lost Günther\" and \"For hours I was up there yelling for him. I don't know why, but he couldn't hear me. He was doing very badly. He didn't make it. Maybe he fell.\"\n\nOn 8 September 2005, the remains were burned at the foot of Nanga Parbat on a pyre in Tibetan tradition. Also borrowing from Tibetan tradition, Reinhold and his expedition team of 14 trekkers and two journalists built a chorten, a square-shaped stack of stones, as a monument. The participants sang \"yelo Lak, the gods were merciful,\" and threw rice into the air.\n\n\n"}

In domestic animals, luteolysis is initiated by the hormones prostaglandin F2alpha and oxytocin. In sheep, communication between the pars nervosa (posterior lobe of the pituitary gland), corpus luteum, and the uterus endometrium via the circulatory system is required for luteolysis. Studies with sheep have found that, if the uterine horn is ipsalateral to the ovary possessing the CL is surgically removed, the lifespan of the corpus luteum will increase drastically.\n\nLuteolysis in primates (including humans), however, is not caused by prostaglandin, and removal of the uterus will not prolong the life of the corpus luteum. However, primates do respond to PGF2a, and asthmatics should take great care when handling this hormone as PGF2a is bronchoconstrictor.\n\nEstrogen, secreted by Granulosa Cells and primarily progesterone, secreted by the corpus luteum, inhibit the release of luteinizing hormone (LH) and Follicle Stimulating Hormone (FSH) by the adenohypophysis (anterior lobe of the pituitary gland) via classical negative feedback mechanisms. This removes the luteotrophic support provided by the gonadotropin luteinizing hormone (LH). During a pregnancy, the corpus luteum remains on the ovary releasing progesterone which will maintain a state of uterine quiescence and close the cervix until the delivery of the fetus. Alternatively if no implantation of a blastocyst occurs, the corpus luteum is degraded to a corpus albicans (scar tissue) by PGF2alpha released by uterine endometrial cells.\n\nDegradation of the corpus luteum will result in reduced levels of progesterone, promoting an increase in follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) secretion by the adenohypophysis, which will trigger the development of a new follicle on the ovary.\n\nIf pregnancy occurs, the placental hormone chorionic gonadotropin continues to maintain the corpus luteum, but in some species it will eventually degrade sometime during pregnancy.\n\nIf pregnancy occurs in equine, the placental hormone equine chorionic gonadotropin released by endometrial cup continue to maintain the progesterone by acting as LH and FSH for follicles in ovary which will in return lead to increase in amount of corpus luteum.\n\n\n"}

This allows the damping characteristics of the shock absorber to be continuously controlled by varying the power of the electromagnet. Fluid viscosity increases within the damper as electromagnet intensity increases. This type of shock absorber has several applications, most notably in semi-active vehicle suspensions which may adapt to road conditions, as they are monitored through sensors in the vehicle, and in prosthetic limbs.\n\n\nMany applications have been proposed using magnetorheological (MR) dampers. While vehicle applications are the most common use of MR dampers, useful medical applications have risen as well, including implants and rehabilitation methods. Since MR dampers are not yet perfect, they are limited in terms of application. Disadvantages do exist when using a large scale MR damper, for example, particle settling within the carrier fluid may occur that inhibits some possible application.\n\nThe technology was originally developed by General Motors Delphi Automotive Division based in the USA and then developed further by BeijingWest Industries in China after BeijingWest Industries bought the technology from General Motors. BeijingWest Industries has subsequently introduced improvements including a redesigned ECU and the introduction of a dual coil system.\n\nThese types of systems are available from OEMs for several vehicles, including the Acura MDX, Audi TT and R8, Buick Lucerne, Cadillac ATS, CTS-V, DTS, XLR, SRX, STS, Chevrolet Corvette, Camaro ZL1, Ferrari 458 Italia, 599GTB, F12 Berlinetta, Shelby GT350, Holden HSV E-Series and Lamborghini Huracán. These systems were produced by the Delphi Corporation and now by BWI Group under the proprietary name MagneRide.\n\nMillenWorks has also included them in several military vehicles including the MillenWorks Light Utility Vehicle, and in retrofits to the US Army Stryker and HMMWV for testing by TARDEC.\n\nMRF-based dampers are excellent candidates for stability augmentation of the lead-lag (in-plane bending) mode of rotor blades in helicopters.\nMRF-based squeeze film dampers are being designed for use in the rotary wing industry to isolate vibrations from the aircraft structure and crew.\n\nA magnetorheological damper is controlled by algorithms specifically designed for the purpose. There are plenty of alternatives, such as skyhook or groundhook algorithms. The idea of the algorithms is to control the yield point shear stress of the magnetorheological fluid with electric current. When the fluid is in the presence of an applied magnetic field, the suspended metal particles align according to the field lines. Viscosity of the fluid increases according to the intensity of the magnetic field. When this occurs at the right instant, the properties of the damper change helps in attenuating an undesired shock or vibration. The relative efficacy of magnetorheological dampers to active and passive control strategies is usually comparable.\n\n"}

The range of medically active compounds that have been identified include antibiotics, anti-cancer drugs, cholesterol inhibitors, psychotropic drugs, immunosuppressants and even fungicides. Although initial discoveries centred on simple moulds of the type that cause spoilage of food, later work identified useful compounds across a wide range of fungi.\n\nAlthough fungi products have been used in traditional and folk medicines, probably since pre-history, the ability to identify beneficial properties and then extract the active ingredient started with the discovery of penicillin by Alexander Fleming in 1928. Since that time, many additional antibiotics have been discovered and the potential for fungi to synthesize biologically active molecules, useful in a wide range of clinical therapies, has been extensively exploited.\n\nPharmacological research has now isolated antifungal, antiviral, and antiprotozoan, isolates from fungi. \nThe fungus with probably the longest record of medicinal use, \"Ganoderma lucidum\", is known in Chinese as líng zhī (\"spirit plant\"), and in Japanese as mannentake (\"10,000-year mushroom\"). In ancient Japan, \"Grifola frondosa\" was worth its weight in silver, although no significant therapeutic benefits have been demonstrated in humans.\n\nStudies have shown another species of genus \"Ganoderma\", \"G. applanatum\", contains compounds with anti-tumor and anti-fibrotic properties.\n\n\"Inonotus obliquus\" was used in Russia as early as the 16th century, and it featured in Alexandr Solzhenitsyn's 1967 novel \"Cancer Ward\".\n\nPaclitaxel is synthesised using \"Penicillium raistrickii\" and plant cell fermentation. Fungi can synthesize other mitotic inhibitors including vinblastine, vincristine, podophyllotoxin, griseofulvin, aurantiamine, oxaline, and neoxaline.\n\n11,11'-Dideoxyverticillin A, an isolate of marine \"Penicillium\", was used to create dozens of semi-synthetic anticancer compounds. 11,11'-Dideoxyverticillin A, andrastin A, barceloneic acid A, and barceloneic acid B, are farnesyl transferase inhibitors that can be made by \"Penicillium\". 3-O-Methylfunicone, anicequol, duclauxin, and rubratoxin B, are anticancer/cytotoxic metabolites of \"Penicillium\".\n\n\"Penicillium\" is a potential source of the leukemia medicine asparaginase.\n\nSome countries have approved Beta-glucan fungal extracts lentinan, polysaccharide-K, and polysaccharide peptide as immunologic adjuvants. Evidence suggests this use as effective in prolonging and improving the quality of life for patients with certain cancers, although the Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center observes that \"well designed, large scale studies are needed to establish the role of lentinan as a useful adjunct to cancer treatment\". According to Cancer Research UK, \"there is currently no evidence that any type of mushroom or mushroom extract can prevent or cure cancer\". Fungal metabolites such as ergosterol, clavilactones, and triterpenoids are efficient Cdk inhibitors that lead to G1/S or G2/M arrest of cancer cells. Other metabolites, such as panepoxydone, are inhibitors of NF-κB. Fucose and mannose fragments of fungal cell wall are antagonists of VEGF-receptors \n\nAlexander Fleming led the way to the beta-lactam antibiotics with the \"Penicillium\" mold and penicillin. Subsequent discoveries included alamethicin, aphidicolin, brefeldin A, Cephalosporin, cerulenin, citromycin, eupenifeldin, fumagillin, fusafungine, fusidic acid, itaconic acid, MT81, nigrosporin B, usnic acid, verrucarin A, vermiculine and many others.\n\nAntibiotics retapamulin, tiamulin, and valnemulin are derivatives of the fungal metabolite pleuromutilin. Plectasin, austrocortilutein, austrocortirubin, coprinol, oudemansin A, strobilurin, illudin, pterulone, and sparassol are antibiotics isolated from basidiomycete species.\n\nStatins are an important class of cholesterol-lowering drugs; the first generation of statins were derived from fungi.\n\nThe Pravastatin precursor mevastatin can be extracted from \"Penicillium\". Lovastatin, the first commercial statin, was extracted from a fermentation broth of \"Aspergillus terreus\". Industrial production is now capable of producing 70 mg lovastatin per kilogram of substrate.\nThe red yeast rice fungus, \"Monascus purpureus\", can synthesize lovastatin, mevastatin, and the simvastatin precursor monacolin J. Zaragozic acids were isolated from ascomycota. Nicotinamide riboside, a cholesterol biosynthesis inhibitor, is made by \"Saccharomyces cerevisiae\".\n\nOther compounds include Simvastatin, a semi-synthetic derivative of Lovastatin.\n\nSome antifungals are derived or extracted from other fungal species. Griseofulvin is derived from a number of Penicillium species, caspofungin is derived from Glarea lozoyensis. Strobilurin, azoxystrobin, micafungin, and echinocandins, are all extracted from fungi. Anidulafungin is a derivative of an \"Aspergillus\" metabolite.\n\nCiclosporin, was discovered in \"Tolypocladium inflatum\". Bredinin was discovered in \"Eupenicillium brefeldianum\". Mycophenolic acid was discovered in \"Penicillium stoloniferum\". Thermophilic fungi were the source of the fingolimod precursor myriocin. \"Aspergillus\" synthesizes immunosuppressants gliotoxin and . Subglutinols are immunosuppressants isolated from \"Fusarium subglutinans\".\nOther compounds include mizoribine.\n\nCodinaeopsin, efrapeptins, zervamicins, and antiamoebin, are made by fungi.\n\nMany fungal isolates act as DPP-4 inhibitors, alpha-glucosidase inhibitors, and alpha amylase inhibitors \"in vitro\". Ternatin is a fungal isolate that suppresses hyperglycemia.\nAspergillusol A is an alpha-glucosidase inhibitor made by \"Aspergillus\". \nSclerotiorin is an aldose reductase inhibitor made by \"Penicillium\".\n\nA number of fungi have well documented psychotropic effects, some of them severe and associated with sometimes acute and life-threatening side-effects. Well known amongst these is \"Amanita muscaria\", the fly agaric. More widely used informally are a range of fungi collectively known as \"magic mushrooms\", which contain psilocybin and psilocin.\n\nThe history of bread-making is also peppered with references to deadly ergotism caused by ergot, most commonly \"Claviceps purpurea\", a parasite of cereal crops. A number of therapeutically useful drugs have subsequently been extracted from ergot including ergotamine, pergolide and cabergoline.\n\nPsychotropic compounds created from ergot alkaloids also include dihydroergotamine, methysergide, methylergometrine, hydergine, nicergoline, lisuride, bromocriptine, cabergoline, pergolide. \"Polyozellus multiplex\" synthesizes prolyl endopeptidase inhibitors polyozellin, thelephoric acid, kynapcins. Neurotrophic fungal isolates include L-theanine, tricholomalides, scabronines, termitomycesphins. Many fungi synthesize the partial, non-selective, serotonin receptor agonist/analog psilocin.\n\nA number of other fungal species, including species of \"Aspergillus\" and \"Penicillium\", have been induced to produce ergot alkaloids.\n\nFungi are a source of ergosterol which can be converted to vitamin D upon exposure to ultraviolet light to synthesize vitamins D (ergocalciferol), D (22-dihydroergocalciferol), and D (Lumisterol+D).\n\n\"Aspergillus niger\" is used to produce recombinant phytase, an enzyme added to animal feeds to improve absorption of phosphorus.\n\nEdible species which contain drugs (biologically active constituents) include:\n\n\"Saccharomyces\" is used industrially to produce the amino acid lysine, as well as recombinant proteins insulin and Hepatitis B surface antigen. Transgenic yeast are used to produce artemisinin, as well as a number of insulin analogs. \"Candida\" is used industrially to produce vitamins ascorbic acid and riboflavin. \"Pichia\" is used to produce the amino acid tryptophan and the vitamin pyridoxine. \"Rhodotorula\" is used to produce the amino acid phenylalanine. \"Moniliella\" is used industrially to produce the sugar alcohol erythritol.\n\n"}

Under the first Obama administration, he served on the Council of Economic Advisors as chief economist. His research interests focus on the nexus between development economics and environmental economics.\n\nA native of the United States, Michael Greenstone earned a B.A. in economics from Swarthmore College in 1991 and a Ph.D in economics from Princeton University in 1998. Thereafter, he worked as a Robert Wood Johnson Scholar at the University of California, Berkeley (UCB, 1998-2000) before becoming an assistant professor of economics at the University of Chicago (2003–06). In 2006, Greenstone moved to MIT, first as associate professor (2003–06) and then as the 3M Professor of Environmental Economics (2006–14). During his tenure at MIT, Greenstone also held visiting appointments at UCB, the University of California Energy Institute, and Stanford University. Most recently, in 2014, he followed a call back to the University of Chicago, where he was made the Milton Friedman Professor in Economics and the College. At the University of Chicago, he further holds positions as director of the Becker Friedman Institute for Economics (BFI), director of the Energy Policy Institute at Chicago (EPIC), and faculty director of the Environment and Energy Lab at the University's Urban Labs. Additionally, Greenstone currently serves among else as co-chair of J-PAL's Environment and Energy sector (with Mushfiq Mobarak), director of the Energy Research Programme at the International Growth Centre (IGC), faculty director of the E2e Project, a fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences and a non-resident senior fellow at the Brookings Institution.

According to IDEAS/RePEc, he currently (February 2018) belongs to the top 1% of highest ranked economists in terms of research publications.\n\nHow does air pollution affect economic outcomes? To investigate this question, Michael Greenstone and Kenneth Y. Chay use geographic variation in the reduction of air pollution due to the 1981-82 recession to estimate the impact of air pollution on infant mortality in the U.S.; they find that reducing TSPs by 1% results in a 0.35% decline in the county-level mortality rate of infants, with most of the reduction concerning newborn deaths, in particular among Afro Americans. In another study with Chay, Greenstone exploits the impact of the U.S. 1970 and 1977 amendments to the Clean Air Act, which set a federal ceiling for total suspended particulates (TSPs), empowered the newly created Environmental Protection Agency to designate \"non-attainment\" counties in excess of that ceiling, and to impose strict air quality regulations on polluters in such counties, on housing prices, to study the relationship between housing prices and air quality. They find that the legislation was effective in reducing TSP air pollution and, based on an elasticity of housing values with regard to TSP concentration ranging from -0.20 to -0.35, that the improvements in air quality between 1970 and 1980 attributable to the regulations imposed under the non-attainment designation caused an increase of housing values in non-attainment counties worth $45 billion. However, Greenstone also finds that the Clean Air Act's non-attainment designation probably played only a minor role in the 80% reduction of sulfur dioxide (SO2) concentrations in the United States, possibly because regulators assigned the SO2 non-attainment designation to many counties that hadn't even exceeded SO2 ceilings for a single day and consequently didn't impose excessively strict regulatory oversight. Finally, Greenstone also analysed the impact of the 1970 and 1977 Clean Air Act Amendments on industrial activity in the U.S. and found that pollution-intensive in \"non-attainment\" counties lost ca. 590,000 jobs, $37 billion in capital stock, and $75 billion (at 1987 U.S. dollars) of output over 1972-87 as a consequence of the greater regulatory oversight exercised by EPA.\n\nTogether with Olivier Deschênes, Michael Greenstone initially found that climate change will increase agricultural profits in the U.S. over 2010-2100 by an average of $1.3 billion per year (in 2002 U.S. dollars) and that the measurement of climate change effects on land prices (the hedonic approach) is extremely sensitive to seemingly minor choices about control variables, sample, and weighting. However, following Fisher et al.'s (2012) critique with regard to data coding errors and conceptual oversights in Deschênes and Greenstone (2007), Deschênes and Greenstone subsequently re-estimated climate change to \"decrease\" U.S. agricultural profits by $4.5 billion per year over 2010-2100. In another collaboration, Greenstone and Deschênes study the relationship between climate change and mortality and its mitigation through adaptation, and estimate that under \"business-as-usual\" scenarios climate change will increase the age-adjusted mortality rate in the U.S. by 3% by the end of the 21st century, though this effect may be strongly mitigated through populations adapting to the expected increase in the frequency of extreme temperature days.\n\nTogether with Hunt Allcott, Greenstone reconsiders the evidence in favour of an energy efficiency gap, i.e. whether consumers and firms fail to invest as much into energy efficiency as the expected increases in terms of utility or profits due to such investments would warrant. Overall, they cannot substantiate claims of a widespread energy efficiency gap, though their differentiation of specific investment inefficiency types leads them to conclude that policies aimed at addressing a supposed energy efficiency gap must be targeted to those consumer subject to investment inefficiencies if they are to be at all effective.\n\nHow much do people value the removal of hazardous waste? Investigating this question, Greenstone and Justin Gallagher use a regression discontinuity design to compare the reaction of housing market prices at hazardous waste sites that narrowly qualified to benefit from Superfund cleanups relative to those who narrowly missed qualifying. They find the reaction to be economically small and statistically insignificant, suggesting that the average local benefits of Superfund cleanups are likely to be much lower than the cleanups' average cost of $43 million.\n\nIn environmental economics as well as in other areas, Greenstone has strongly advocated for the greater application of (quasi-)experimental methods to identify which policies are effective and efficient in terms of increasing social welfare.\n\nHow does the opening of a new manufacturing plant affect the productivity of incumbent manufacturing plants? Studying this question with Richard Hornbeck and Enrico Moretti, Greenstone finds that \nthe TFP of incumbent plants in counties that were selected as the site for the opening of a new plant increase 12% more than in their runner-up competitors, with the agglomeration spillovers being particularly large if the old and new plants are similar. However, they also find that the wage growth in \"winning\" counties caused by the increased local labour demand tends to exceed productivity growth, thus reducing plant profits.\n\nExploiting the 1987 federal permission to U.S. states to only raise the speed limit on their rural interstates from 55 mph (ca. 90 kmh) to 65 mph (ca. 105 kmh), Greenstone and Orley Ashenfelter compare the time saved due to the increase in speed limit with the increase in fatality rates (an increasy by ca. 35%) to estimate the value of a statistical life.

In several countries, especially in Scandinavia, early birds are called \"A-people\" and night owls are called \"B-people\". Night owls who are involuntarily unable to fall asleep for several hours after a normal time may have delayed sleep phase syndrome. \n\nThe opposite of a night owl is an early bird – a lark as opposed to an owl – which is someone who tends to begin sleeping at a time that is considered early and also wakes early. Researchers traditionally use the terms \"morningness\" and \"eveningness\" for the two chronotypes or diurnality and nocturnality in animal behavior. \n\nThe term is derived from the primarily nocturnal habits of the owl. Most owls sleep during the day and hunt for food at night.\n\nUsually, people who are night owls stay awake past midnight, and extreme night owls may stay awake until just before or even after dawn. Night owls tend to feel most energetic just before they go to sleep at night. \n\nSome night owls have a preference or habit for staying up late, or stay up to work the night shift. Night owls who work the day shift often have difficulties adapting to standard daytime working hours.\n\nNight owls have often been blamed for unpunctuality or attitude problems. Employers, however, have begun to learn to increase productivity by respecting body clocks through flexible working hours, while the Danish \"B-Society\" of night owls and the American Start School Later movement lobby actively for more school and workplace flexibility for the post-agricultural world.\n\nSome research has found that night owls are more intelligent and creative and more likely to get high-paying jobs than larks. A study among 1000 adolescents by the University of Madrid found that owls are better than early birds in intuitive intelligence, creative thinking and inductive reasoning. However, they lag behind larks in academic performance, and they tend to have unhealthier eating habits.\n\nSome night owls with great difficulty adopting normal sleeping and waking times may have delayed sleep-phase disorder. Morning light therapy may be helpful in shifting sleep rhythms for the night owl.\n\nThe tendency to be a night owl exists on a spectrum, with most people being typical, some people having a small or moderate tendency to be a night owl, and a few having an extreme tendency to be a night owl. An individual's own tendency can change over time and is influenced by multiple factors, including:\n\n\nThe genetic make-up of the circadian timing system underpins the difference between early and late chronotypes, or early birds and night owls. While it has been suggested that circadian rhythms may change over time, including dramatic changes that turn a morning lark to a night owl or vice versa, evidence for familial patterns of early or late waking would seem to contradict this, and individual changes are likely on a smaller scale.\n\nA 2007 survey of over 55,000 people found that chronotypes tend to follow a normal distribution, with extreme morning and evening types on the far ends.\n\nNight owls tend to thrive in careers that do not require working in the early morning. People who want to work in the evening are often employed at restaurants, hotels, entertainment venues, retail stores, and some personal care businesses. Night owls who work the night shift may work in emergency services, in transportation, or at round-the-clock facilities, such as hospitals and some manufacturing plants.\n\nMany businesses that operate in the evening or at night need employees at all levels, from entry-level employees to managers to skilled staff, whenever they are open. For example, most hospitals employ many types of workers around the clock: \n\n\nIndustries that tend to be less favorable to night owls include farming, construction, and working for public utilities. Many employees in these industries start working before 7:00 a.m.\n\nA list of famous night owls includes:\n\nFor Robert Louis Stevenson, \"there is a romance about all those who are abroad in the black hours.\"\n\nIn Jayne Ann Krentz's \"Truth or Dare\", \"Arcadia and Harry were both creatures of the night. They managed to appear oddly stylish at one-thirty in the morning.\"\n\nBritish author Hilary Rubinstein wrote: \"Blessed are the owls, for they shall inherit the mystery and magic of the night.\"\n\nIn Pliny the Elder's Natural History, he states \"Vita vigila est\", \"to be alive is to be watchful\", a military metaphor for keeping watch in the night.\n\nIn The Little River Band, hit \"The Night Owls\": \"be strong, find the heart of a night owl falling/Stay up till dawn until the night is gone\"\n\n\n\n"}

He testified about KGB activities. The KGB unsuccessfully tried to kill him with poison in 1957.\n\nKhokhlov's parents divorced when he was very young. He was not well-acquainted with his father, who later served as a commissar in the Red Army. During the Battle for Moscow, the elder Khokhlov was transferred to a penal battalion because he had made unfavourable remarks about Joseph Stalin. Khokhlov's father died in the battalion.\n\nHis stepfather, a lawyer, volunteered to defend Moscow in 1941 and died in action almost immediately. As Khokhlov later put it, \"The army needed cannon fodder\".\n\nIn October 1941, Khokhlov, then 19 years old, was a member of an NKVD quartet who were trained to commit a spectacular attack against Nazi officers during their victory celebration in the occupied Moscow. The mastermind behind the plan was Mikhail Maklyarskiy, a senior NKVD official. The four young agents would have played a vaudeville group on the celebration. Khokhlov was chosen for his role on his whistling abilities. During the training, he had his first great romance with fellow agent, singer Tasya Ignatova. After the German retreat from the outskirts of Moscow, the deadly show was cancelled.\n\nNikolai Khokhlov was a member of a successful military unit that fought behind the enemy lines during World War II. He was disguised as a Nazi officer after parachuting into German-occupied Belarus. He played a part in the assassination of Wilhelm Kube, the Nazi Gauleiter of Belarus. After the war, Khokhlov became the prototype for the main character in a 1947 Soviet film, \"Feat of a Scout\" (\"Подвиг разведчика\").\n\nIn 1954, Khokhlov was sent by the KGB to supervise two other men whose task was to kill Georgiy Okolovich, a chairman of the National Alliance of Russian Solidarists. He decided not to follow the order and discussed the situation with his wife, Yana, who said, \"If this man is killed, you will be a murderer. I cannot be the wife of a murderer.\" Khokhlov went to Okolovich's flat in Frankfurt and told him: \"Georgiy Sergeyevich, I have come to you from Moscow. The Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union has ordered your assassination. The murder is entrusted to my group... I can’t let this murder happen.\" In retaliation, his wife was arrested and sentenced to five years of involuntary settlement in the Soviet Union. Khokhlov defected to the United States following his failure to carry out the assassination order.\n\nKhokhlov was treated for thallium poisoning in Frankfurt in 1957, as a result of a failed assassination attempt by the Thirteenth Department of the KGB. This case is often claimed to be the first radiological attack by the KGB, especially when comparison with the poisoning of Alexander Litvinenko is drawn, although it remains unclear what isotope was used, if any. Former KGB officer Stanislav Lekarev claimed, however, that Khokhlov was poisoned by radioactive polonium (not thallium), exactly as Litvinenko was. Litvinenko's poisoning was also initially mistaken for thallium.\n\nAfter graduating with a PhD from Duke University, Khokhlov taught undergraduate and graduate psychology classes at California State University, San Bernardino from 1968 to 1992. He retired as a professor emeritus in 1993. In 1992, Russian President Boris Yeltsin pardoned him. Khokhlov returned to Moscow for a short stay, for the first time since the 1950s. He later made an e-mail contact with, then eventually met, his son in Russia of whom he had not been previously aware. In the United States, Khokhlov married again. With his second wife Tanja, he had two daughters and a son, Misha, who died several years later due to a kidney failure.\n\nIn 2006, Khokhlov compared his poisoning half a century ago to the murder of Litvinenko. \"The situation within Russia today is very perilous. There are no more laws, and no more order. Putin brought back many KGB, and there are too many KGB at the top, the old dinosaurs who cannot get rid of old habits\", he added.\n\nNikolai Khokhlov died of a heart attack in San Bernardino, California, in September 2007. He was buried next to the grave of his son.\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "14470857", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=14470857", "title": "Radiation-induced cognitive decline", "text": "Radiation-induced cognitive decline\n\nRadiation-induced cognitive decline describes the possible correlation between radiation therapy and mild cognitive impairment. Radiation therapy is used mainly in the treatment of cancer. Radiation therapy can be used to cure care or shrink tumors that are interfering with quality of life. Sometimes radiation therapy is used alone; other times it is used in conjunction with chemotherapy and surgery. For people with brain tumors, radiation can be an effective treatment because chemotherapy is often less effective due to the blood–brain barrier. Unfortunately for some patients, as time passes, people who received radiation therapy may begin experiencing deficits in their learning, memory, and spatial information processing abilities. The learning, memory, and spatial information processing abilities are dependent on proper hippocampus functionality. Therefore, any hippocampus dysfunction will result in deficits in learning, memory, and spatial information processing ability.\n\nThe hippocampus is one of two structures of the central nervous system where neurogenesis continues after birth. The other structure that undergoes neurogenesis is the olfactory bulb. Therefore, it has been proposed that neurogenesis plays some role in the proper functionality of the hippocampus and the olfactory bulb. To test this proposal, a group of rats with normal hippocampal neurogenesis (control) were subjected to a placement recognition exercise that required proper hippocampus function to complete. Afterwards a second group of rats (experimental) were subjected to the same exercise but in that trial their neurogenesis in the hippocampus was arrested. It was found that the experimental group was not able to distinguish between its familiar and unexplored territory. The experimental group spent more time exploring the familiar territory, while the control group spent more time exploring the new territory. The results indicate that neurogenesis in the hippocampus is important for memory and proper hippocampal functionality. Therefore, if radiation therapy inhibits neurogenesis in the hippocampus it would lead to the cognitive decline observed in patients who have received this radiation therapy.\nIn animal studies discussed by Monje and Palmer in \"Radiation Injury and Neurogenesis\", it has been proven that radiation does indeed decrease or arrest neurogenesis altogether in the hippocampus. This decrease in neurogenesis is due to apoptosis of the neurons which usually occurs after irradiation. However it has not been proven whether the apoptosis is a direct result of the radiation itself or if there are other factors that cause neuronal apoptosis, namely changes in the hippocampus micro-environment or damage to the precursor pool. Determining the exact cause of the cell apoptosis is important because then it may be possible to inhibit the apoptosis and reverse the effects of the arrested neurogenesis.\n\nIonizing radiation is classified as a neurotoxicant. A 2004 cohort study concluded that irradiation of the brain with dose levels overlapping those imparted by computed tomography can, in at least some instances, adversely affect intellectual development. \n\nRadiation therapy at doses around \"23.4 Gy\" was found to cause cognitive decline that was especially apparent in young children who underwent the treatment for cranial tumors, between the ages of 5 to 11. Studies found, for example, that the IQ of 5-year-old children declined each year after treatment by additional several IQ points, thereby the child's IQ decreased and decreased while growing older though may plateau at adulthood.\n\nRadiation of 100 mGy to the head at infancy resulted in the beginning appearance of statistically significant cognitive-deficits in one Swedish/radiation-therapy follow-up study. Radiation of 1300-1500mGy to the head at childhood was similarly found to be roughly the threshold dose for the beginning increase in statistically significant rates of schizophrenia. \n\nFrom soliciting for participants in a study and then examination of the prenatally exposed at Hiroshima & Nagasaki, those who experienced the prompt burst of ionizing radiation at the 8-15 and 16–25 week periods after gestation were to, especially in the closest survivors, have a higher rate of severe mental retardation as well as variation in intelligence quotient (IQ) and school performance. It is uncertain, if there exists a threshold dose, under which one or more of these effects, of prenatal exposure to ionizing radiation, do not exist, though from analysis of the limited data, \"0.1\" Gy is suggested for both.\n\nAdult humans receiving an acute whole body incapacitating dose (30 Gy) have their performance degraded almost immediately and become ineffective within several hours. A dose of 5.3 Gy to 8.3 Gy is considered lethal within months to half of male adults but not immediately incapacitating. Personnel exposed to this amount of radiation have their cognitive performance degraded in two to three hours. Depending on how physically demanding the tasks they must perform are, and remain in this disabled state at least two days. However, at that point they experience a recovery period and can perform non-demanding tasks for about six days, after which they relapse for about four weeks. At this time they begin exhibiting symptoms of radiation poisoning of sufficient severity to render them totally ineffective. Death follows for about half of males at approximately six weeks after exposure.\n\nNausea and vomiting generally occur within 24–48 hours after exposure to mild (1–2 Gy) doses of radiation. Headache, fatigue, and weakness are also seen with mild exposure.\n\nExposure of adults to 150−500 mSv results in the beginning observance of cerebrovascular pathology, and exposure to 300 mSv results in the beginning of the observance of neuropsychiatric and neurophysiological dose-related effects. Cumulative equivalent doses above 500 mSv of ionizing radiation to the head, were proven with epidemiological evidences to cause cerebrovascular atherosclerotic damage, thus increasing the chances of stroke in later life. The equivalent dose of 0.5 Gy (500 mGy) x-rays is 500 mSv.\n\nRecent studies have shown that there is a decrease in neurogenesis in the hippocampus after irradiation therapy. The decrease in neurogenesis is the result of a reduction in the stem cell pool due to apoptosis. However, the question remains whether radiation therapy results in a complete ablation of the stem cell pool in the hippocampus or whether some stem cells survive. Animal studies have been performed by Monje and Palmer to determine if there is an acute ablation of the stem cell pool. In the study, rats were subjected to 10 Gy dosage of radiation. The 10 Gy radiation dosage is comparable to that used in irradiation therapy in humans. One month after the reception of the dosage, living precursor cells from these rats’ hippocampus were successfully isolated and cultured. Therefore, a complete ablation of the precursor cell pool by irradiation does not occur.\n\nPrecursor cells may be damaged by radiation. This damage of the cells may prevent the precursor cells from differentiating into neurons and result in decreased neurogenesis. To determine whether the precursor cells are impaired in their ability to differentiate, two cultures were prepared by Fike et al. One of these cultures contained precursor cells from an irradiated rat’s hippocampus and the second culture contained non-irradiated precursor cells from a rat hippocampus. The precursor cells were then observed while they continued to develop. The results indicated that the irradiated culture contained a higher number of differentiated neuron and glial cells in comparison to the control. It was also found that the ratios of glial cells to neurons in both cultures were similar. These results suggest that the radiation did not impair the precursor cells ability to differentiate into neurons and therefore neurogenesis is still possible.\n\nThe microenvironment is an important component to consider for precursor survival and differentiation. It is the microenvironment that provides the signals to the precursor cells that help it survive, proliferate, and differentiate. To determine if the microenvironment is altered as a result of radiation, an animal study was performed by Fike et al. where highly enriched, BrdU labeled, non-irradiated stem cells from a rat hippocampus were implanted into a hippocampus that was irradiated one month prior. The stem cells were allowed to remain in the live rat for 3–4 weeks. Afterwards, the rat was killed and the stem cells were observed using immunohistochemistry and confocal microscopy. The results show that stem cell survival was similar to that found in a control subject (normal rat hippocampus); however, the number of neurons generated was decreased by 81%. Therefore, alterations of the microenvironment post radiation can lead to a decrease in neurogenesis.\n\nIn addition, studies mentioned by Fike et al. found that there are two main differences between the hippocampus of an irradiated rat and a non-irradiated rat that are part of the microenvironment. There was a significantly larger number of activated microglia cells in the hippocampus of irradiated rats in comparison to non-irradiated rats. The presence of microglia cells is characteristic of the inflammatory response which is most likely due to radiation exposure. Also the expected clustering of stem cells around the vasculature of the hippocampus was disrupted. Therefore, focusing on the microglial activation, inflammatory response, and microvasculature may produce a direct link to the decrease in neurogenesis post irradiation.\n\nRadiation therapy usually results in chronic inflammation, and in the brain this inflammatory response comes in the form of activated microglia cells. Once activated, these microglia cells start to release stress hormones and various pro-inflammatory cytokines. Some of what is released by the activated microglia cells, like the glucocorticoid stress hormone, may result in a decrease in neurogenesis. To investigate this concept, an animal study was performed by Monje et al. in order to determine the specific cytokines or stress hormones that were released by activated microglial cells that decrease neurogenesis in an irradiated hippocampus. In this study, microglia cells were exposed to bacterial lipopolysaccharide to elicit an inflammatory response, thus activating the microglia cells. These activated microglia were then co-cultured with normal hippocampal neural stem cells. Also, as a control, non-activated microglia cells were co-cultured with normal hippocampal neural stem cells. In comparing the two co-cultures, it was determined that neurogenesis in the activated microglia cell culture was 50% less than in the control. A second study was also performed to ensure that the decrease in neurogenesis was the result of released cytokines and not cell-to-cell contact of microglia and stem cells. In this study, neural stem cells were cultured on preconditioned media from activated microglia cells and a comparison was made with a neural stem cells cultured on plain media. The results of this study indicated that neurogenesis also showed a similar decrease in the preconditioned media culture versus the control.\n\nWhen microglia cells are activated, they release the pro-inflammatory cytokine IL-1β, TNF-α, INF-γ, and IL-6. In order to identify the cytokines that decreased neurogenesis, Monje et al. allowed progenitor cells to differentiate while exposed to each cytokine. The results of the study showed that only the recombinant IL-6 and TNF-α exposure significantly reduced neurogenesis. Then the IL-6 was inhibited and neurogenesis was restored. This implicates IL-6 as the main cytokine responsible for the decrease of neurogenesis in the hippocampus.\n\nThe microvasculature of the subgranular zone, located in dentate gyrus of hippocampus, plays an important role in neurogenesis. As precursor cells develop in the subgranular zone, they form clusters. These clusters usually contain dozens of cells. The clusters are made up of endothelial cells and neuronal precursor cells that have the ability to differentiate into either neurons or glia cells. With time, these clusters eventually migrate towards microvessels in the subgranular zone. As the clusters get closer to the vessels, some of the precursor cells differentiate in glia cells and eventually the remaining precursor cells will differentiate into neurons. Upon investigation of the close association between the vessels and clusters, it is apparent that the actual migration of the precursor cells to these vessels is not random. Since endothelial cells forming the vessel wall do secrete brain-derived neurotrophic factor, it is plausible that the neuronal precursor cells migrate to those regions in order to grow, survive, and differentiate. Also, since the clusters do contain endothelial cells, they might be attracted to the vascular endothelial growth factor that is released in the area of vessels to promote endothelial survival and angiogenesis. However, as noted previously, clustering along the capillaries in the subgranular zone does decrease when the brain is subject to radiation. The exact reasoning for this disruption of the close association between cluster and vessels remains unknown. It is possible that any signaling that would normally attract the clusters to the region, for example the bone-derived growth factor and the vascular endothelial growth factor, may be suppressed.\n\nNeurogenesis in the hippocampus usually decreases after exposure to radiation and usually leads to a cognitive decline in patients undergoing radiation therapy. As discussed above, the decrease in neurogenesis is heavily influenced by changes in the microenvironment of the hippocampus upon exposure to radiation. Specifically, disruption of the cluster/vessel association in the subgranular zone of the dentate gyrus and cytokines released by activated microglia as part of the inflammatory response do impair neurogenesis in the irradiated hippocampus. Thus several studies have used this knowledge to reverse the reduction in neurogenesis in the irradiated hippocampus. In one study, indomethacin treatment was given to the irradiated rat during and after irradiation treatment. It was found that the indomethacin treatment caused a 35% decrease in the number of activated microglia per dentate gyrus in comparison to microglia activation in irradiated rats without indomethacin treatment. This decrease in microglia activation reduces the amount of cytokines and stress-hormone release, thus reducing the effect of the inflammatory response. When the number of precursor cells adopting a neuronal fate was quantified, it was determined that the ratio of neurons to glia cells increased. This increase in neurogenesis was only 20-25% of that observed in control animals. However, in this study the inflammatory response was not eliminated entirely, and some cytokines or stress hormones continued to be secreted by the remaining activated microglia cells causing the reduction in neurogenesis. In a second study, the inflammatory cascade was also blocked at another stage. This study focused mainly on the c-Jun NH2 – terminal kinase pathway which when activated results in the apoptosis of neurons. This pathway was chosen because, upon irradiation, it is the only mitogen-activated protein kinase that is activated. The mitogen-activated protein kinases are important for regulation of migration, proliferation, differentiation, and apoptosis. The JNK pathway is activated by cytokines released by activated microglia cells, and blocking this pathway significantly reduces neuronal apoptosis. In the study, the JNK was inhibited using 5 µM SP600125 dosage, and this resulted in a decrease of neural stem cells apoptosis. This decrease in apoptosis results in increased neuronal recovery.\n\nIn previous work, environmental enrichment has been used to determine its effect on brain activity. In these studies, the environmental enrichment has positively impacted the brain functionality in both normal, healthy animals and animals that had suffered severe brain injury. It has already been shown by Elodie Bruel-Jungerman et al. that subjecting animals to learning exercises that are heavily dependent on the hippocampus results in increased neurogenesis. Therefore, the question of whether environmental enrichment can enhance neurogenesis in an irradiated hippocampus is raised. In a study performed by Fan et al., the effects of environmental enrichment on gerbils were tested. There were four groups of gerbils used for this experiment, where group one consisted on non-irradiated animals that lived in a standard environment, group two were non-irradiated animals that lived in an enriched environment, group three were irradiated animals that lived in a standard environment, and group four were irradiated animals that lived in an enriched environment. After two months of maintaining the gerbils in the required environments, they were killed and hippocampal tissue was removed for analysis. It was found that the number of precursor neurons that were differentiated into neurons from group four (irradiated and enriched environment) was significantly more than group three (irradiated and standard environment). Similarly, the number of neuron precursor cells was more in group two (non-irradiated and enriched environment), in comparison to group one (non-irradiated and standard environment). The results indicate that neurogenesis was increased in the animals that were exposed to the enriched environment, in comparison to animals in the standard environment. This outcome indicates that environmental enrichment can indeed increase neurogenesis and reverse the cognitive decline.\n\n\n"}

In medicine this is used to document the patient's exertion during a test, and sports coaches use the scale to assess the intensity of training and competition. The original scale introduced by Gunnar Borg rated exertion on a scale of 6-20. Borg then constructed a category (C) ratio (R) scale, the Borg CR10 Scale. This is especially used in clinical diagnosis of breathlessness and dyspnea, chest pain, angina and musculo-skeletal pain. The CR-10 scale is best suited when there is an overriding sensation arising either from a specific area of the body, for example, muscle pain, ache or fatigue in the quadriceps or from pulmonary responses.\n\nThe Borg scale can be compared to other linear scales such as the Likert scale or a visual analogue scale. The sensitivity and reproducibility of the results are broadly very similar, although the Borg may outperform the Likert scale in some cases.\n\nThe Borg RPE scale is a numerical scale that ranges from 6 to 20, where 6 means \"no exertion at all\" and 20 means \"maximal exertion.\" When a measurement is taken, a number is chosen from the following scale by an individual that best describes their level of exertion during physical activity.\n\n"}
{"id": "41965635", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=41965635", "title": "Refugee health care in Canada", "text": "Refugee health care in Canada\n\nRefugee health care refers to the provision of health services to refugees and refugee claimants. As early as 2009, health researchers identified particular medical needs and health vulnerabilities amongst these populations. Compared to other immigrants, they report more physical, emotional, and dental problems and, compared to those born in Canada, they have higher rates of infections and chronic diseases that are both treatable and preventable. In Canada, the federal government has been responsible for the provision of health care to refugees since 1957. In the international law context, this responsibility falls under Canada's human rights obligations to recognize the right to health for all, including refugees.\n\nThe concept of a “right to health” has been recognized in a number of international rights instruments to which Canada is a party. It was first articulated in the 1946 Constitution of the World Health Organization as “the right to the enjoyment of the highest attainable standard of physical and mental health.\" Article 25 of the 1948 Universal Declaration of Human Rights also mentions the right to health as part of the right to an adequate standard of living. Some international human rights instruments acknowledge a right to health by general application and others through the protection of rights of specific groups such as women or children. In 1966, the right to health was recognized as a human right in article 12 of the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights (ICESCR), which imposes an obligation on state parties to the Covenant to create “conditions which would assure to all medical service and medical attention in the event of sickness”.\n\nThe \"Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms\" does not include any express protection of the right to health. The Canadian government has frequently argued in court that social and economic rights - including the right to health - are merely ‘policy objectives’ that are not subject to judicial intervention. The ICESCR Committee has voiced concern over Canada's lack of compliance to these international obligations. It argues that such submissions are incompatible with Canada's obligations to provide remedies to violations of Covenant rights in domestic law.\n\nRight to health claims under the \"Charter\"'s section 15 equality provision have had limited success. In \"Eldridge v. British Columbia\", in the context of the provision of sign language, the Supreme Court found that the government should ensure that disadvantaged members of society have equal access to benefits. The Court noted that any finding to the contrary would result in a “thin and impoverished view… of equality”. In a later case about the provision of autism services, \"Auton v. British Columbia\", the Court narrowed the \"Eldridge\" approach by requiring that protected benefits be ones “provided by law”.\n\nThough a substantive equality approach to section 15 has had limited success in remedying health and other social and economic rights violations of disadvantaged groups, Colleen Flood, one of Canada's leading health law professors, argues that failed claims can contribute to furthering equality by illuminating a problem and generating political support for its resolution.\n\nIn Canada, the provision of basic health care for refugees and refugee claimants is regulated by the Interim Federal Health Programme (IFHP) before they are covered by provincial or territorial health insurance plans. The IFHP was introduced through an Order-in-Council by the federal government in 1957 and has been managed by Citizenship and Immigration Canada since 1995. Prior to June 2012, the IFHP provided refugees and asylum seekers with basic health care coverage as well as supplemental coverage including access to medication, dentistry, and vision care. Those whose application for refugee status were denied retained coverage until they were deported.\n\nThe Canadian government introduced a series of changes in April 2012, which came into effect on June 30, 2012. As of June 30, 2012, IFHP divides asylum seekers into three categories with differing levels of health coverage depending upon the person's country of origin. There are now three baskets of services: (1) expanded health care coverage, (2) health care coverage, and (3) public health or public safety health care coverage. If the refugee claimant is from a designated country of origin, they will receive “very limited” health coverage. Some of the provinces have stepped in to cover services and medication no longer provided under the IFHP.\n\nIn defending the changes, the government explained its rationale as being to ensure equality between the health care received by refugees and that afforded to Canadians such that refugees would not receive superior benefits. Former Citizenship and Immigration Minister Jason Kenney emphasized the generosity of Canadians and Canada's immigration system, stating that the government did “not want to ask Canadians to pay for benefits for protected persons and refugee claimants that are more generous than what they are entitled to themselves.” In a related case, Nell Toussaint v. Attorney General of Canada, the Supreme Court cautioned that by extending universal health care regardless of immigration status, Canada “could become a health-care safe haven”.\n\nThe government also made cost and deterrence arguments in favour of reforming the legislation. These changes were estimated to save 100 million dollars over five years. The government argued that the cuts would deter claimants who are drawn to the country for its health care.\n\nCritics of the 2012 reforms include the Canadian Medical Association Journal and the Canadian Paediatric Society. The heads of eight major professional associations including nurses, social workers, and physicians signed a letter opposing the cuts, demanding that pre-2012 refugee health provision be restored. These advocates argue that the differential treatment of refugees and refugee applicants depending on their country of origin is discriminatory. Ontario's Health Minister Deb Matthews called for the changes to be reversed stating that “this policy change will create a class system for health care in Canada.”\n\nThe Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms does not include any express protection of the right to health, but this right has been protected indirectly by Courts through the use of other provisions, such as the section 15 equality guarantee. Section 15(1) provides that “every individual is equal before and under the law and has the right to the equal protection and equal benefit of the law without discrimination and, in particular, without discrimination based on race, national or ethnic origin, colour, religion, sex, age or mental or physical disability.”\n\nThe current legal test for a section 15 equality analysis comes from Andrews as affirmed in R v Kapp. It requires that the court satisfy two conditions: (1) the law creates a distinction based on an analogous or enumerated ground (2) the distinction creates a disadvantage by perpetuating prejudice or stereotyping.\n\nPrior to the 2012 reforms, in Nell Toussaint v Attorney General, Toussaint challenged the constitutionality of the IFHP on the basis of the proposed analogous grounds of disability and citizenship. The Court found neither of these grounds to be applicable to the claimant in question, but made a point of leaving open the question as to whether immigration status could be an analogous ground. If found to be an analogous ground, the applicant's exclusion from IFHP coverage could have been in violation of section 15(1) of the Charter. The Canadian Civil Liberties Association, in its intervenor factum, drew a comparison between immigration status and non-citizens. A number of cases have recognized that non-citizens, which capture many different types of immigration statuses, constitute an analogous ground under section 15(1). For example, in Andrews v. Law Society of British Columbia, the Court held that citizenship is an analogous ground since it was a personal characteristic “typically not within the control of the individual, and in this sense, is immutable.” In Lavoie v. Canada, the Court held that “non-citizens suffer from political marginalization, stereotyping and historical disadvantage.”\n\nIn December 2013, the Canadian Doctors for Refugee Care (CDRC) and the Canadian Association of Refugee Lawyers (CARL) brought a challenge to the Federal Court of Canada claiming that the government's cuts to refugee health care were unconstitutional. Specifically, CARL proposes that both “country of origin” and “immigration status” are discriminatory grounds under section 15(1) of the Charter.\n\nThe right to health has been litigated under Charter provisions outside of section 15. The current CDRC/CARL challenge to the IFHP reforms is founded on two additional Charter provisions: (1) the right to life and security of the person under section 7; and (2)the right not to be subjected to cruel and unusual treatment under section 12.\n\nRecent studies have identified significant gaps in health care coverage for female refugees, particularly in the areas of pregnancy and mental health care. Specifically, barriers to health care access such financial difficulty have been shown to intersect with other post migration difficulties experienced by women with migrant status like downward social mobility, poor access to optimal nutrition, and limited social networks. Moreover, women with migrant status are more vulnerable to being refused care on the basis of their insurance status, thereby relying on informal networks of volunteers and willing physicians, dentists, and pharmacies. Disparities have further been identified in the area of perinatal care, where uninsured migrant women are shown to receive less overall coverage than their insured counterparts, in addition to paying for diagnostic, physician, and hospital fees, leading to less than optimal outcomes. Mental health issues among female Syrian refugees have been examined, specifically instances of maternal depression. Causes for these mental health issues are varied and include lack of social support, in addition to cultural and socioeconomic factors. Further, migrant and refugee women are more likely to succumb to postpartum depression due to the additional stressors of the migratory experience.\n\nAccess to health care for refugees and other migrant populations has been constrained by language barriers, among other cultural factors. A 2012 study showed that roughly sixty percent of government-assisted refugees had no English or French language skills, therefore acting as a deterrent to accessing proper health care. Concerns over privacy are also significant, as some women have expressed reluctance to using interpreters within the same, small ethnic community. However, proper interpreter training may help bridge the gaps between patient and health practitioner, as is the case in British Columbia where the Provincial Health Services Authority trained thirty interpreters in anticipation of the arrival of 3,500 Syrian refugees in 2016.\n\nSteady declines in migrant health have been noted to occur within a few years of arrival in Canada, a phenomenon known as the \"healthy immigrant effect\", due largely to Canadian immigration policy and medical evaluations of potential immigration candidates. In study of Tamil and Iranian female refugees in Canada, instances of mental symptoms such as recurring nightmares, emotional detachment, hyper vigilance, and difficulty concentrating have been noted. Moreover, it has been observed that youth who have experienced living as refugees demonstrate higher levels of emotional problems and aggressive behaviors due to past traumas. It was further noted that instances of post arrival trauma, in the form of discrimination based on race or refugee status, have significant negative effects on mental outcomes for youth.\n"}

She and her husband, Otis Banks, established the Temple Health Institute in East Los Angeles, which became a model for community-based health clinics across the country.\n\nDr. Ruth Janetta Temple was born in Natchez, Mississippi, in 1892 to Amy Morton and Richard Jason Temple. Ruth was her parents' second-born child. Her siblings included Walter, Vivian, Richard, Ethel, and Lanier Temple. Two other siblings died at a young age.\n\nTemple's parents stressed the importance of education and humanism. Her father, a Baptist minister and graduate of Denison University, especially stressed the importance of looking beyond racial barriers and therefore made his home to be a place where people of all backgrounds could congregate. He even shared his personal collection of books written in Greek and Hebrew with Jewish, Catholic and Protestant theologians who needed them for research. Her father felt that, \"People will come into our house. All people, all kinds of people, of all race all creeds, all colors, and all educational backgrounds. Our children will learn love before they learn hate.\" His perspective on race had a strong impact on Temple's life and made it easier for her to work in integrated spaces in her adult life. Temple's mother shared her husband's community spirit. She frequently invited people who were less fortunate into their home for food and clothing.\n\nTwo years after her father died in 1902, Ruth and her family moved to southeast Los Angeles. Originally Amy Temple had homeschooled her children, but she had to go back to work as a nurse to provide for her family. So Ruth had to act as a mother while she was gone. When Temple was 13, her oldest brother Walter, was experimenting with gunpowder outside. He put it into a hose and lit it, causing the gunpowder to blow up in his face. Ruth ran over to her brother who was lying on the ground, grabbed his head and turned it to her. Brushed the soot and powder off his face. She realized he hadn't done much damage, except from a singed eyebrow. After this she saw the possibility of helping others and taking pain away, from then on she wanted to be a physician. In another event Ruth was even more determined to be a physician. One day the Temple's neighbors son, Ernie Fennell, fell into an oil ditch in the area and was carried away for a quarter of a mile. When he was rescued he was covered with oil and wasn't breathing. Ruth knelt down and gave Ernie CPR. After a few moments he began coughing and breathing. One day Juliette Estelle Troy an African American Seventh-day Adventist witnessed to the Temple family. The Troy family and Temple family became the founding members of the Furlong Track Church, the first African American Seventh-day Adventist church in the West, founded in 1908.\n\nTemple enrolled in the College of Medical Evangelists (Loma Linda University) in 1913 and became the first African American woman to graduate from this institution. Temple's family could not afford to fund her college education, but T.W. Troy, a prominent member of the Los Angeles Forum, a black men's civic organization, arranged for the group to pay Temple's tuition. Troy continued to sponsor her education until she graduated with a bachelor's degree in medicine in 1918. She then interned in 1921 at the Los Angeles City Health Department, where she specialized in obstetrics and gynecology. After over twenty years of service in the medical profession, Temple was accepted in the Public Health master's program at Yale University in 1941, and the Los Angeles City Health Department awarded her with a scholarship to support her advanced educational endeavors.\n\nUpon graduation from Loma Linda, Ruth Temple began working to create public health services to underserved low-income communities in Los Angeles. She opened the first medical clinic in Southeast Los Angeles, a city of 250,000 people. Funding for the clinic was scarce, so she and her husband Otis Banks turned their newly purchased five-bedroom bungalow into the Temple Health Institute. The institute was a free medical clinic that discussed common community issues such as substance abuse, immunization, nutrition and sex education. Ruth found it important to educate adults and children; she wanted people to be self-sufficient, so that nothing would prevent them from getting the resources they need to maintain a healthy life. \n\nShe developed, within the institute, community-based programs like the Total Health Program, the Health Study Center, and the Health Study Club. These programs were designed to educate patients and other local residents about the resources available not only in her clinic, but also in the larger community. These services were offered in schools, PTAs, YWCAs, churches, synagogues, service agencies, private medical practices, study clubs, block-to-block trainings, and local health information centers. Her program gained national attention with acronyms like ABC, which stands for \"Acquiring basic health knowledge, Bringing into practice what is learned, and Communicating it to contacts\". Even after her retirement in 1962 Temple continued to work in the public health service.\n\nTemple was a member of the American Medical Association, the Women's University Club, the California Medical Association, the California Congress of Parents and Teachers, and Alpha Kappa Alpha.\n\nRuth Janetta Temple died in 1984 at age 91. A year prior to her death, the East Los Angeles Health Center was renamed the Dr. Ruth Temple Center in her honor.\n\n"}

Microbial simultaneous nitrification-denitrification is the conversion of the ammonium ion to nitrogen gas in a single bioreactor. The process is dependent on floc characteristics, reaction kinetics, mass loading of readily biodegradable chemical oxygen demand, rbCOD, and the dissolved oxygen, DO, concentration\n\nThe oxidation of the ammonium to nitrogen gas has been achieved with attached growth and suspended growth wastewater treatment processes. The most common bacteria responsible for the two step conversion are the autotrophic organisms, \"Nitrosomonas\" and \"Nitrobacter\", and many different heterotrophs. The former obtain energy from the oxidation of ammonia, obtain carbon from CO, and use oxygen as the electron acceptor. They are termed autotrophic because of their carbon source and termed aerobes because of their aerobic environment. The heterotrophic organisms are responsible for denitrification or the reduction of nitrate, NO, to nitrogen gas, N. They use carbon from complex organic compounds, prefer low to zero dissolved oxygen, and use nitrate as the electron acceptor.\n\nThe most common design uses two different basins: one catering to the autotrophic bacteria and the second to the heterotrophic bacteria. However, SNdN accommodates to both in one basin with strict control of DO. This has been done in two common approaches. One is to develop an oxygen gradient by adding oxygen in one location in the basin. Near the O2 injection point, a high DO concentration is maintained allowing for nitrification and oxidation of other organic compounds. Oxygen is the electron acceptor and is depleted. The DO level in localized environments decreases with increasing distance from the injection point. In these low DO locations, the heterotrophic bacteria complete the nitrogen removal. The Orbal process is a technology in practice today using this method. The other method is to produce an oxygen gradient within the bio floc. The DO concentration remains high in the outside rings of the floc where nitrification occurs but low in the inner rings of the floc where denitrification occurs. This method is dependent on the floc size and characteristics; however controlling flocs is not well understood and is an active field of study\n\nTypically, SNdN has slower ammonia and nitrate utilization rates as compared to separate basin designs because only a fraction of the total biomass is participating in either the nitrification or the denitrification steps. The SNdN limitation due to partial active biomass has led to research in novel bacteria and system designs. Huang achieved significant ammonia removal in an attached growth process with ciliated columns packed with granular sulfur where the denitrifying bacteria used the sulfur as the electron donor and nitrate as the electron acceptor. Another well established pathway is via autotrophic denitrifying bacteria in the process termed the Anammox process. It is typically used for high ammonia strength wastewater.\n\n"}

There are also surgeons in podiatry, dentistry and the veterinary fields.\n\nThe first person to document a surgery was the 6th Century BC Indian physician-surgeon, Sushruta. He specialised in cosmetic plastic surgery and had documented even an operation of open rhinoplasty. His magnum opus \"Suśruta-saṃhitā\" is one of the most important surviving ancient treatises on medicine and is considered a foundational text of Ayurveda and surgery. The treatise addresses all aspects of general medicine, but the translator G. D. Singhal dubbed Suśruta \"the father of surgical intervention\" on account of the extraordinarily accurate and detailed accounts of surgery to be found in the work. \n\nAfter the eventual decline of the Sushruta School of Medicine in India, surgery had been largely ignored until the Islamic Golden Age surgeon Al-Zahrawi (936-1013), reestablished surgery as an effective medical practice. He is considered the greatest medieval surgeon to have appeared from the Islamic World, and has been described as the father of surgery. His greatest contribution to medicine is the \"Kitab al-Tasrif\", a thirty-volume encyclopedia of medical practices. \nHe was the first physician to describe an ectopic pregnancy, and the first physician to identify the hereditary nature of hæmophilia. \n\nHis pioneering contributions to the field of surgical procedures and instruments had an enormous impact on surgery but it was not until the eighteenth century that surgery as a distinct medical discipline emerged in England.\n\nIn Europe, surgery was mostly associated with barber-surgeons who also used their hair-cutting tools to undertake surgical procedures, often at the battlefield and also for their employers. With advances in medicine and physiology, the professions of barbers and surgeons diverged; by the 19th century barber-surgeons had virtually disappeared, and surgeons were almost invariably qualified doctors who had specialized in surgery. Surgeon continued, however, to be used as the title for military medical officers until the end of the 19th century, and the title of Surgeon General continues to exist for both senior military medical officers and senior government public health officers.\n\nIn 1950, the Royal College of Surgeons of England (RCS) in London began to offer surgeons a formal status via RCS membership. The title \"Mister\" became a badge of honour, and today, in many Commonwealth countries, a qualified doctor who, after at least four years' training, obtains a surgical qualification (formerly Fellow of the Royal College of Surgeons, but now also Member of the Royal College of Surgeons or a number of other diplomas) is given the honour of being allowed to revert to calling themselves Mr, Miss, Mrs or Ms in the course of their professional practice, but this time the meaning is different. It is sometimes assumed that the change of title implies consultant status (and some mistakenly think non-surgical consultants are Mr too), but the length of postgraduate medical training outside North America is such that a qualified surgeon may be years away from obtaining such a post: many doctors previously obtained these qualifications in the senior house officer grade, and remained in that grade when they began sub-specialty training. The distinction of Mr (etc.) is also used by surgeons in the Republic of Ireland, some states of Australia, Barbados, New Zealand, South Africa, Zimbabwe, and some other Commonwealth countries.\n\nIn many English-speaking countries the \"military\" title of surgeon is applied to any medical practitioner, due to the historical evolution of the term. The US Army Medical Corps retains various surgeon MOS' in the ranks of officer pay grades for military personnel dedicated to performing surgery on wounded soldiers.\n\nSome physicians who are general practitioners or specialists in family medicine or emergency medicine may perform limited ranges of minor, common, or emergency surgery. Anesthesia often accompanies surgery, and anesthesiologists and nurse anesthetists may oversee this aspect of surgery. Surgeon's assistant, surgical nurses, surgical technologists are trained professionals who support surgeons.\n\nIn the United States, the Department of Labor description of a surgeon is \"a physician who treats diseases, injuries, and deformities by invasive, minimally-invasive, or non-invasive surgical methods, such as using instruments, appliances, or by manual manipulation\".\n\n\n"}

TST focuses on the child's emotional and behavioral needs as well as the environments where the child lives (home, school, community). The treatment model includes four components (skill-based psychotherapy, home and community based care, advocacy, and psychopharmacology) that are fully described in a published manual.

TST has also been successfully replicated.\n\nTrauma Systems Therapy treatment is not just for the victims. It also educates the victims significant others in order for them to support the victims in their recovery and help them control their emotions during future stressful events.\n\nWhen referring to TST, therapists are looking at four categories: the reason a child may need TST, the signs and symptoms expressed by the child, the management and treatment methods and the results of children who have gone through TST. A look at what causes emotional trauma, the families involved, and how therapy can heal the child as well as the adult are also important factors.\n\nTraumatic events that affect children are seen in households where sexual, mental, or physical abuse is present. The inability to regulate self-emotions either directly or indirectly is a clinical sign that a traumatic event has affected the child. According to child psychiatrist Dr. Glenn Saxe, “TST is a comprehensive model for treating traumatic stress in children and adolescents that adds to individually based approaches by specifically addressing the child’s social environment and/or systems of care”. This may include children or adolescents having social problems in school or in their home secondary to rape, physical abuse, neglect, death of a caregiver and/or any significant life altering emotion trauma. Sexual, physical, or mental traumatic events can affect present, past memory, and the anticipated future. Saxe’s theory in “The March of the Moments: Traumatic Stress in the Past, Present, and Future,” begins with “survival-in-the-moment” which causes severe emotions, unexplained personality changes, erratic behavior due to a sudden trigger that reminds the child of the event. Second, “Past memory” refers to “laying down of the present, conscious moments in the brain so that they can be accessible if we need them”. This causes significant long-term trauma because if a child is not able to understand what has happened to him or her in the past, then he or she will go through life with a band-aid on this wound instead of healing mentally and physically. Finally, “marching into the future” refers to one of the most detrimental causes of traumatic stress, its effect on the child’s ability to think into the future. Saxe states, “If consciousness is about the present, and memory is about the past, then planning and anticipation are about the future”. One’s ability to see into the future is part of the human cognition, when a child starts to “calculate survival-related risk”; this causes significant stress by continuously reliving the trauma. When a child or adolescent plans their future around what might happen, this never allows the cause of the problem to be resolved, insuring they will never mentally or emotional heal. In addition to the black and white causes of Traumatic Stress, there are also secondary causes that are directly related to these events. So TST not only addresses the event at hand but also the associated problems that come along with it.\n\nThe treatment for TST is based on professional finding. PTSD is an umbrella diagnosis that includes many children and adolescents who show the basic problem of the inability to regulate their emotions. When evaluating a child for TST, therapists look for awareness, affects, and actions when faced with a stressful event or unfamiliar situation. Children who have been exposed to traumatic events show secondary symptoms such as the following: self modulation, self-destructive behavior, disassociation, feeling shameful, sadness, anger, hostility, social withdrawal, poor relationship skills, or changes in personality. In many children, these symptoms can show up long after the event has occurred, during puberty or even the transition into adulthood.\n\nThere are three main groups used to categorize a child’s trauma, starting with Awareness (elements of attention, sense of self, orientation); Affect (mood disorders, personality disorders); and Action (conduct disorders, personality, mood disorders, eating disorders, or substance abuse). The disorders listed are usually first seen by family members, teachers, counselors, or other adults in the child’s life. Children who show signs of depression may also be affected by some sort of PTSD and would benefit from TST. Once children are clinically depressed, they tend to show changes in their thinking about themselves, their view of the world and how they see the future. We see the signs and symptom associated with the event spill over into the home life, social life, academics and extracurricular activities. Unfortunately, children haven’t learned coping skills to deal with traumatic events. Instead, they act out or start the downward spiral to self-destruction. Understanding what to look for and recognizing this behavior in a child or adolescent is key to early detection and success.\n\nManagement of such intense emotional stress has to include the child affected, as well as his or her social surroundings. TST treats the home and proved community based care, provides a service advocacy, helps with emotional regulation skills training and uses psychopharmacology to treat patients. Knowledge of the child’s trauma, what stage he or she is at in the recovery phase, and willingness to seek treatment is all part of the healing process for the child and his or her family.\n\nTherapy starts with the home environment. The caregiver has to understand the core problem by addressing if his or her child is sad a lot, destructive, or maybe the school keeps calling CPS (child protective services). Understanding why the child is acting in such a manner is crucial in the healing process. Treatment for family, teachers and social workers is done so all the adults are on the same page with the problem at hand; they understand the course for treatment and can all be tools for the child to use during TST. Next, everyone in the child’s life must become a service advocacy, which means holding “Family Collaborative Meetings”. This offers education and information to the adults so they know what to expect from TST. Dedication from the adults to meet at the scheduled times, have adequate transportation to therapy, ability to overcome language barriers, and put their children’s needs before their own are all essential to success. Emotional regulation skills training is very important to therapy. The process starts with assessment, and then going through the course of treatment. Coping skills are stable and healthy ways to overcome stress and manage a child’s emotions and emotional identification, giving the child tools so he or she can better deal with the strategies, and communication about feelings, emotions, fears and concerns. Finally, psychopharmacology is medication used to help a person’s emotional state. To reach the best therapeutic effect for a child, all of these concepts have to be integrated. The medication approach starts with SSRIs (Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitors); these help with anxiety, depression and impulsivity. The second-line medications are Benzodiazepines, Tricyclic antidepressants and Antipsychotic medication. These are very strong and are used as a last-ditch effort to prevent a child from having severe emotional problems. Occasionally, sleeping medication is prescribed but all are under careful supervision for harmful side effects. TST is an ongoing process that attempts to heal the child, not band-aid the problem; thus, medication is used sparingly and patients are weaned to lower therapeutic doses over time.\n\nTST patients showed a much longer committed enrollment time versus the patient in basic therapy by almost 90%. The key to success is preventing dropout; this is a long process and significant evidence-based treatment needs at least eight sessions. Children with emotional trauma tend to come from substance abuse families and lower income. This makes it hard for parents to be committed to TST, particularly if they struggle with addiction or abuse themselves. Children have shown significant progress just by the one-on-one attention during TST; a child’s social environment is crucial to his or her success in treatment. Results vary in different social levels of the country, different families and what each child has experienced and its severity.\n\n"}
