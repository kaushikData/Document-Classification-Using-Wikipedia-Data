The Dutch Association for Physical Education (NBLO) organised walking marches in those days. During the Second World War, these 'walking marches' were prohibited by the occupation forces.\n\nSince there was a demand for a walking event in the 't Gooi area, walks developed under the term 'wandelvierdaagse'. These walks were first held in 1940, and soon caught on in other places in the Netherlands. When occupation forces found out about this new form of walking, they banned the events as assemblies against the occupiers.\n\nAfter the Second World War, the avondvierdaagse was re-established by various municipalities and local associations. Within a few years, many avondvierdaagsen were being held again. Currently, almost all cities in the Netherlands have such events, and some of these have grown into major events such as the International Four Days Marches Nijmegen (Nijmeegse Vierdaagse).\n\nToday, overall coordination of these walks is done by the Royal Walkers Union of the Netherlands (Koninklijke Wandelbond Nederland), and the event has its own website at Avondvierdaagse.nl.\n\nOften, avondvierdaagsen are offered in 2 or 3 distances: typically 5 kilometres, 10 kilometres, and 15 kilometres. The same distance is usually not walked all 4 days, but the total distance usually comes out to average days multiplied by advertised kilometres. In many places, on the last day all participants walk the same distance.\n\nLarge walking events (such as the International Four Days Marches Nijmegen) have much greater distances, e.g. 30, 40 or even 50 kilometres.\n\n\n"}

They reflect neuronal activity in the auditory nerve, cochlear nucleus, superior olive, and inferior colliculus of the brainstem. They typically have a response latency of no more than six milliseconds with an amplitude of approximately one microvolt.\n\nDue to their small amplitude, 500 or more repetitions of the auditory stimulus are required in order to average out the random background electrical activity. Although it is possible to obtain a BAEP to a pure tone stimulus in the hearing range, a more effective auditory stimulus contains a range of frequencies in the form of a short sharp click.\n\nLong and Allen were the first to report the abnormal BAEPs in an alcoholic woman who recovered from acquired central hypoventilation syndrome. These investigators hypothesized that their patient's brainstem was poisoned, but not destroyed, by her chronic alcoholism.\n"}
{"id": "19981527", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=19981527", "title": "Bromance", "text": "Bromance\n\nA bromance is a close but non-sexual relationship between two or more men. It is an exceptionally tight affectional, homosocial male bonding relationship exceeding that of usual friendship, and is distinguished by a particularly high level of emotional intimacy. The emergence of the concept since the beginning of the 21st century has been seen as reflecting a change in societal perception and interest in the theme, with an increasing openness of western society in the twenty-first century to reconsider gender, sexuality, and exclusivity constraints.\n\n\"Bromance\" is a portmanteau of \"bro\" (or \"brother\") and \"romance\". Dave Carnie is credited with coining the term as editor of the skateboard magazine \"Big Brother\" in the 1990s to refer specifically to the sort of relationships that develop between skaters who spent a great deal of time together. The term did not attain broad currency until approximately 2005 when the theme became more prominent in the motion picture industry.\n\nNumerous examples exist of intense homosocial friendships throughout history; such relationships were common between men and also between women. The term \"romantic friendship\" is a modern historical construct with a different homoerotic connotation and social construction; it is discussed within its own article.\n\n\"Bromance\" has been examined from viewpoints such as historiography, discourse analysis, social research, and queer theory in book-length reviews. The emergence of \"bromance\" as a topic over the past decade has been seen as reflecting how society has collectively changed its perception and interest in the theme.\n\nSeveral characteristics of bromance have been cited:\n\nAccording to Chen, society has taken a collective interest in reexamination of some of the traditional constraints on male friendship, and in potentially reshaping the constructs of gender, sexuality, and intimacy. Bromance provides \"a case study of gender, sexuality, and exclusivity constraints in twenty-first century America as they operate in law and beyond. Those constraints in turn speak to the privilege and subordination imbued in this type of relationship, with implications for other types as well.\" This is distinct from the connotations of \"romantic friendship\", a term of 20th century historical scholarship that retrospectively described close homosocial relationships, which had become less common after potential physical intimacy between non-sexual partners came to be regarded with anxiety in the second half of the 19th century.\n\nOn the one hand, social interest in the theme has been seen as driving the film industry, which has then fed back to society at large, exploring peoples' mindsets and addressing acceptance of \"other types of relationships\" between people. On the other hand, some have seen the emphasis on platonic love as a rejection of homoeroticism, or as a deliberate confounding of \"homosocial\" and \"homoerotic\" relationships.\n\n\"Bromance\" has also been seen as a reflection of greater \"discursive expressivity\". The experiences of friendship and masculinity, perhaps due to more open parenting styles from the 1970s, reflect a trend toward more openness emotionally, with increased expressivity. According to sociologist Peter Nardi, \"men are less afraid of being perceived as gay. It has become more acceptable for them to show some emotion.\" Men are marrying later, if at all, which impacts male bonding. According to the 2010 US Census, the average age of a man's first marriage is 28, up from 23 in 1960; men with more education are waiting until their 30s before getting married.\n\nA number of celebrity relationships have been popularly characterised as \"\"bromances\". Although \"bromance\" is a new term, this treatment of celebrity relationships is not new: The composer Franz Schubert had a very close friendship with poet Franz von Schober, whose texts Schubert set to music. They were nicknamed \"Schobert\" in early 19th century Vienna.\n\nDean Martin and Jerry Lewis as the 1946-1956 ‘rock star’ comedy team Martin and Lewis set a new standard for a complex, multifaceted enactment of a ‘special’ male friendship.” Coming post-war, “the comedy of Martin and Lewis teased with a sly alternative to the model of heterosexual affirmation traditionally peddled by Hollywood, as their intense and unstable relationship showcased a panoply of emotional and erotic intensities between men. The cultural resonance of Martin and Lewis's comedy derived from the way it set in motion a more complex ‘queering of gender.’” They starred in 16 films together as an inseparable unit, as well as on early live television and in nightclubs. They had an immeasurable effect on millions of baby boomers and future comedians, (including George Clooney, whose aunt Rosemary Clooney was a guest on their show).\n\nBen Affleck and Matt Damon were described as \"perhaps the pioneering bromance in showbiz history\"\", which led to a hit off-Broadway play called \"Matt and Ben\". The relationship between Zachary Quinto and Chris Pine, stars of the 2009 \"Star Trek\" film, has been described similarly, in common with their on-screen characters' relationship.\n\nThe close friendship between George Clooney and Brad Pitt was once suggested to be \"George's longest-lasting affair\" and Clooney's bromantic tendencies served as the basis for an episode of the animated series \"American Dad!\" entitled \"Tears of a Clooney\", in which lead character Stan Smith becomes bromantically involved with Clooney as part of an elaborate revenge plot.\n\nProfessional footballers Eric Dier and Dele Alli, who play together for Tottenham Hotspur and England, have a close relationship that has been described as a \"bromance\".\n\nDuring the 2016 Olympic 100m finals, the friendship between Jamaican Usain Bolt and Canadian Andre De Grasse emerged, characterized and celebrated on social media as a bromance.\n\nThe tight relationship both on- and off-stage between Bruce Springsteen and the late E Street Band saxophonist Clarence Clemons has often been described as one of the most fitting examples of \"bromance\" in Western modern music. This relationship is most notably depicted in Springsteen's song \"Tenth Avenue Freeze-Out\", from \"Born to Run\" – in which Springsteen and Clemons appear respectively under their pseudonyms Bad Scooter and Big Man. It was also described in Clemons' autobiography \"Big Man: Real Life & Tall Tales\".\n\nThe Japanese and Korean music industry actively encourages bromance among male celebrities (particularly members of boy bands) as part of the fan service to please the audience.\n\nWhile the term has generally been applied to straight relationships, mixed gay-straight relationships without sexual intimacy have also been dubbed \"bromances\". Examples of well-known gay-straight bromances include George Michael and Andrew Ridgley from the band Wham!, Ronnie Kroell and Ben DiChiara from the Bravo reality series \"Make Me a Supermodel\", in which the pair was nicknamed \"Bronnie\", the relationship on \"\" between Charlie Herschel and Marcus Lehman, and \"American Idol\"'s Kris Allen and Adam Lambert, which was given the name \"Kradam\".\n\nBuddy films have to a degree been rebranded as \"bromance\" films, although critics draw a distinction between the two, noting that a buddy film tends to be more explicitly violent and less open about its latent homosexual content. The intersection between buddy films and what would come to be called the bromance film was noted comedically at least as early as 1978, when \"National Lampoon\" ran a parody ad for the football-themed buddy film \"Semi-Tough\", renamed \"Semi-Sweet\" and featuring an illustration of stars Burt Reynolds and Kris Kristofferson holding hands.\n\nProminent examples of \"bromantic comedy\" include Judd Apatow's \"The 40 Year Old Virgin\" (2005) and \"Knocked Up\" (2007), which targeted non-sexual homosocial behavior and masculinity in inventive ways, David Dobkin's \"Wedding Crashers\" (2005), \"Zoolander\", \"Funny People\" (2009), John Hamburg's \"I Love You Man\" (2009), Todd Phillips' \"The Hangover\" (2009), and Gordon's \"Horrible Bosses\" (2011).\n\nAlthough J. R. R. Tolkien's novels predate what could technically be called the \"bromance era\", the portrayal of the lifelong close relationships between Frodo Baggins and Samwise Gamgee, Meriadoc Brandybuck and Peregrin Took, and Gimli and Legolas in the novels have been characterized as bromance, as well as the depictions in the films based on them.\n\nThe theme remains popular, with different genres looking at the concept in various ways, such as the documentary \"Best of Enemies\" – about the 1960s feud between intellectuals Gore Vidal and William F. Buckley.\n\nBromance on television has also become more commonplace. It appeared early-on in the partnership of two CIA/KGB spies in the 1960s' \"Man from U.N.C.L.E.\", and in the 1970s' buddy-cop show \"Starsky & Hutch\", which producer Aaron Spelling called \"TV’s first heterosexual love affair.\" Some critics also point to the 1970s' \"Odd Couple\", about which executive producer Garry Marshall has said, \"The network was concerned that we were being too gay.\"\n\nIn October 2008, \"TV Guide\" placed Gregory House (Hugh Laurie) and James Wilson (Robert Sean Leonard) on the cover, under the headline \"Isn't It Bromantic?\".\n\nBrody Jenner, featured on MTV's reality show \"The Hills\" and the subject of bromance discussions for his relationships with castmates Justin Bobby and Spencer Pratt, debuted his own series on the network, called \"Bromance\", on December 29, 2008. The six-episode series features Jenner selecting from amongst competitors to become part of Jenner's \"entourage\".\n\nIn \"Scrubs\", J.D. is a sensitive doctor \"completely in touch with his feelings. He's not afraid of showing his best pal Turk how much he loves him.\" In one episode, they sing, \"Guy love. That’s all it is.\" The J.D. and Turk relationship truly embodies one of the best bromances ever. They always stand by each other's side and often one thinks they are more in love with each other than their significant other. \"The Good Guys\" \"promotes male bonding while self-consciously acknowledging its homoerotic overtones.\" \"The Independent\" analyzed the BBC's \"Sherlock\" as a \"bromance\", and looked at bromance thematically. The relationship between Sherlock Holmes and Dr. Watson as a bromance has been visited elsewhere also.\nThe cultural concept that \"bromance\" connotes particular closeness has been taken up thematically. The concept has been visited in biology, as well as an experimental acrobatic video dance piece, \"Bromance\", which explores “... the intimacy of physical interaction between guys; of their ‘bromance’.”\n\nThe relationship between George W. Bush and former press secretary Scott McClellan as told in McClellan's book \"What Happened\" was called by one reviewer \"the tale of one long, failed bromance\".\n\nIn 2012, the song \"Bromance\" by comedian, YouTube personality, and actor Ryan Higa (also known by his YouTube username \"nigahiga\"), went viral.\n\nThe former premiers Dalton McGuinty of Ontario (2003–2013) and Jean Charest of Quebec (2003–2012) were described as a \"\"burgeoning bromance\". Stephen Harper of Canada (2006–2015) and Tony Abbott of Australia (2013–2015), and their respective countries, were characterized as a \"conservative bromance\"\". The term has been used to describe Narendra Modi from India and Barack Obama from the United States during the January 2015 visit, and Vladimir Putin from the Russian Federation with Gerhard Schröder from Germany.\n\nIn early 2017, a number of internet memes surfaced which alluded to Obama's relationship with Vice President Joe Biden as a \"bromance\".\n\nA Bromance has been linked with a decrease in “problems such as anxiety, depression, heart disease, and memory and concentration impairment”\n\n"}

It was developed by chemists Lowell Schleicher and Barry Green, as an alternative to carbon paper and is sometimes misidentified as such.\n\nInstead of inserting a special sheet in between the original and the intended copy, carbonless copy paper has micro-encapsulated dye or ink on the back side of the top sheet, and a clay coating on the front side of the bottom sheet. When pressure is applied (from writing or impact printing), the dye capsules rupture and react with the clay to form a permanent mark duplicating the markings made to the top sheet. Intermediary sheets, with clay on the front and dye capsules on the back, can be used to create multiple copies; this may be referred to as multipart stationery.\n\nCarbonless copy paper consists of sheets of paper that are coated with micro-encapsulated dye or ink or a reactive clay. The back of the first sheet is coated with micro-encapsulated dye (referred to as a Coated Back or CB sheet). The lowermost sheet is coated on the top surface with a clay that quickly reacts with the dye to form a permanent mark (Coated Front, CF). Any intermediate sheets are coated with clay on top and dye on the bottom (Coated Front and Back, CFB).\n\nWhen the sheets are written on with pressure (e.g., ball-point pen) or impact (e.g., typewriter, dot-matrix printer), the pressure causes the micro-capsules to break and release their dye. Since the capsules are so small, the resulting print is very accurate.\n\nCarbonless copy paper was also available in a self-contained version that had both the ink and the clay on the same side of the paper.\n\nCarbonless copy paper was first produced by the NCR Corporation, applying for a patent on June 30, 1953. Formerly, the options were to write documents more than once or use carbon paper, which was inserted between the sheet being written upon and the copy. Carbonless paper was used as business stationery requiring one or more copies of the original, such as invoices and receipts. The copies were often paper of different colors (e.g., white original for customer, yellow copy for supplier's records, and other colors for subsequent copies). Stationery with carbonless copy paper can be supplied collated either in pads or books bound into sets, or as loose sets, or as continuous stationery for printers designed to use it.\n\nThe first dye used commercially in this application was crystal violet lactone, which is widely used today. Other dyes and supporting chemicals used are PTSMH (\"p\"-toluene sulfinate of Michler's hydrol), TMA (trimellitic anhydride), phenol-formaldehyde resins, azo dyes, DIPN (diisopropyl naphthalenes), formaldehyde isocyanates, hydrocarbon-based solvents, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, polyoxypropylene diamine, epoxy resins, aliphatic isocyanates, Bisphenol A, diethylene triamine, and others. The dyes in carbonless copy papers may cause contact dermatitis in sensitive persons.\n\nUntil the 1970s, when the use of polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) was banned due to health and environmental concerns, PCBs were used as a transfer agent in carbonless copy paper. PCBs are readily transferred to human skin during handling of such papers, and it is difficult to achieve decontamination by ordinary washing with soap and water. In Japan, carbonless copy paper is still treated as a PCB-contaminated waste.\n\nExposure to certain types of carbonless copy paper or its components has resulted, under some conditions, in mild to moderate symptoms of skin irritation and irritation of the mucosal membranes of the eyes and upper respiratory tract. A 2000 review found no irritation or sensitization on contact with carbonless copy paper produced after 1987. In most cases, good industrial hygiene and work practices should be adequate to reduce or eliminate symptoms. These include adequate ventilation, humidity, and temperature controls; proper housekeeping; minimal hand-to-mouth and hand-to-eye contact; and periodic cleansing of hands.\n\nIn a 1997 study, the University of Florida found that a poorly-ventilated office where large amounts of carbonless copy paper were used had significant levels of volatile organic compounds present in its air, whereas a well-ventilated office where little such paper was used did not. The study also found that there were higher rates of sick leave and illness complaints at the office using large amounts of carbonless copy paper. Another study, which was published in \"Environmental Health Perspectives\", connected chronic occupational exposure to paper dust and carbonless copy paper with an increased risk of adult-onset asthma.\n\nThe average carbonless copy paper contains a high concentration of Bisphenol A (BPA), an endocrine disruptor.\n\nIn 2001, three employees of a medical center in San Francisco filed a lawsuit against their employer, blaming exposure to carbonless copy paper and other chemicals for their inflammatory breast cancer.\n\n\n\n"}

In Catholic Europe, convents were heavily endowed over the centuries, and were sponsored by the aristocracy. Religious orders were founded by entrepreneurial women who saw a need and an opportunity, and were staffed by devout women from poor families. the numbers grew exponentially from about 900 in the year 1840, to a maximum of nearly 200,000 in 1965, falling to 56,000 in 2010. The network of Catholic institutions provided high status, but low-paying lifetime careers as nuns in parochial schools, hospitals, and orphanages. They were part of an international Catholic network, with considerable movement back and forth from Britain, France, Germany and Canada.\n\nSome American Catholics came to the defense of American sisters when the Vatican initiated an investigation into what it viewed as unorthodox leanings among the Leadership Conference of Women Religious. The controversial investigation, which was viewed by many U.S. Catholics as a \"vexing and unjust inquisition of the sisters who ran the church's schools, hospitals and charities\" was ultimately closed in 2015 in meeting with Pope Francis. \n\nThe first women religious in what would become the United States, were fourteen French Ursuline nuns who arrived in New Orleans in July 1727, and opened Ursuline Academy, which continues in operation and is the oldest continuously operating school for girls in the United States.\n\nThe Sisters of Saint Anne are a Roman Catholic religious institute, founded in 1850 in Vaudreuil, Quebec, Canada, by the Blessed Marie Anne Blondin, S.S.A. The Sisters arrived in the United States in September 1867 at the request of the Bishop of Buffalo, opening a school in Oswego, New York. Between 1840 and 1930 approximately 900,000 Quebec residents, most of them French Canadian left for the United States. Textile manufacturing centers and other industrial towns such as Lewiston, Maine, Fall River, Massachusetts, Woonsocket, Rhode Island and Manchester, New Hampshire attracted significant French-Canadian populations. The Sisters went on to expand throughout northern New York and New England, staffing many schools of French-speaking parishes.\n\n\n\nOther communities who assisted the sick and wounded include: the Sisters of St. Joseph, Carmelites, Dominican Order, Ursulines, Sisters of Mercy, Congregation of the Sisters of Our Lady of Mercy, Daughters of Charity of St. Vincent de Paul, Sisters of Charity of Nazareth, and the Congregation of Divine Providence.\n\nThe majority of these women followed an active apostolate; the number of contemplative communities being relatively small. About sixty percent were primarily involved with teaching, while the rest were engaged in nursing.\n\nThe numbers grew rapidly, from 900 sisters in 15 communities in 1840, 50,000 in 170 orders in 1900, and 135,000 in 300 different orders by 1930. Starting in 1820, the sisters always outnumbered the priests and brothers. Young women entered after elementary school, and spent one year at a novitiate training program before entering full-time roles. Their total number peaked in 1965 at 180,000 then plunged to 56,000 in 2010. Most simply left their orders. There were very few replacements. In the early 1960s, 7000 young women a year joined the orders; by 1990 there were only 1000 a year.\n\n<nowiki>*</nowiki>estimate\n\nin the period before the American Civil War, it was common for anti-Catholic Protestants to sponsor semi-pornographic lectures by ex-Catholic nuns. Ugly rumors spread to the effect that convents and nunneries were organized for the sexual pleasure of the male priests, with the corpses of dead babies buried underneath. The Know-Nothing movement of the 1850s was especially focused on these allegations. Winning control of the Massachusetts state legislature in 1854, the Know Nothings set up a legislative investigation to try and substantiate the rumors. The press had a field day following the story, especially when it was discovered that the key reformer was using committee funds to pay for a prostitute in Boston. The legislature shut down its committee, ejected the reformer, and saw its investigation became a laughing stock.\n\nBy the middle of the 19th century, the Catholics in larger cities started building their own parochial school system. The main impetus was fear that exposure to Protestant teachers in the public schools, and Protestant fellow students, would lead to a loss of faith. Protestants reacted by strong opposition to any public funding of parochial schools. The Catholics nevertheless built their elementary schools, parish by parish, using very low paid sisters as teachers. They created the world's largest network of religious schools.\nIn the classrooms, the highest priorities were piety, orthodoxy, and strict discipline. Knowledge of the subject matter was a minor concern. The sisters came from numerous denominations, and there was no effort to provide joint teachers training programs. The bishops were indifferent. Around 1911, led by The Catholic University of America, Catholic colleges began summer institutes to train the sisters in pedagogical techniques. Dolan notes that in the early 20th century a majority young nuns who became teachers had not attended high school. They taught for a half-century or more and long past World War II, the Catholic schools were noted for inferior conditions compared to the public schools, and less well-trained teachers. The rapid growth of the Catholic population continued, and after 1945 it started to pour into the suburbs. At the peak in 1960, 13,000 schools served over 5 million students.\n\nBy the 1960s there was a growing lack of teaching sisters. The solution was to hire much more expensive lay teachers, who grew from 4% of the elementary teachers in the Chicago archdiocese in 1950 to 38% by 1965.\n\nThe tension between the sisters' religious commitment and their professional role emerged in the 19th century and grew more serious over time. In the 19th century the women generally saw the religious role as paramount, with their service to God expressed through their nursing or teaching or other activities. The bishops put little emphasis on advanced training or education. In hospitals, the sisters were prohibited from working in obstetric units, or venereal disease care. By the 20th century, however, the demands for professionalism in nursing grew stronger; many Catholic hospitals opened nursing schools, and the students did much of the routine nursing care for patients. In 1948 the Conference of Catholic Schools of Nursing was formed to promote college education for the nursing sisters. Before the 1940s the Catholic educators held that sisters who had not graduated from high school could learn to teach from their elders and by experience, while the public schools were requiring much stronger credentials. The goal was to quickly open as many schools as possible. The 90,000 teaching sisters were served by 150 collegiate centers designed to provide them a bachelor's degree before they taught.\n\nBishop Jean-Marie Odin (1800–1870), rebuilt the Catholic Church in antebellum Texas. Odin vigorously recruited priests and religious workers from the Eastern states, Quebec, England, and France. He reached the Hispanic, Irish, German and Polish children by bringing in the Ursuline teaching order of sisters and the Missionary Oblate priests of Mary Immaculate.\n\nIn German districts, the Catholic parochial schools were taught entirely in German until World War I, despite the protests of Yankees and Irish Catholics who tried to Anglicize those schools through the Bennett Law of 1890 in Wisconsin.\n\nThe Americanization of new immigrants was a major role for the teaching sisters especially with the arrival of the Italians, Poles and others from Eastern and Southern Europe in the late 19th century, and the arrival of Hispanics after 1960. The Felician Sisters originated in Poland and came to the United States in 1874, which became its main base. The sisters provided social mobility for young Polish women. Although the congregation was involved in the care of orphans, the aged, and the sick, teaching remained its primary concern. In Toledo, Ohio, in the early 20th century Polish nuns were used to assist the assimilation of Polish children. The sisters deemphasized the children's Polish heritage and taught in English, making frequent reference to Polish words .\n\nIn Chicago, some of the black children arriving from Louisiana were already Catholic, and were taught by Catholic sisters. The primarily Irish American Sisters of the Blessed Sacrament for Indians and Colored People, the mostly German-American Franciscan Sisters, and the Polish-American Sisters of the Holy Family lived in the all-black segregated neighborhoods, where they learned about the pervasiveness of racism in America.\n\nIn April 1956 the Holy See's Congregation of the Affairs of Religious requested that religious sisters in the U.S. form a national conference. In November of that year, the committee of sisters in the U.S. called a meeting in Chicago of general and provincial superiors of pontifical communities consider the formation of a national conference. They voted unanimously to establish the Conference of Major Superiors of Women (CMSW) to \"promote the spiritual welfare\" of the country's women religious, \"insure increasing effectiveness of their apostolate,\" and \"foster closer fraternal cooperation with all religious of the United States, the hierarchy, the clergy, and Catholic associations.\" The name was changed in 1971 to the \"Leadership Conference of Women Religious\". The conference includes over 1500 members, encompassing approximately 80 percent of the 57,000 women religious in the United States as of 2015. The conference describes its charter as assisting its members \"collaboratively carry out their service of leadership to further the mission of the Gospel in today's world.\" The canonically-approved organization collaborates in the Catholic church and in society to \"influence systemic change, studying significant trends and issues within the church and society, utilizing our corporate voice in solidarity with people who experience any form of violence or oppression, and creating and offering resource materials on religious leadership skills.\" The conference serves as a resource both to its members and to public seeking resources on leadership for religious life.\n\n\nCouncil of Major Superiors of Women Religiou, http://www.cmswr.org, more recently founded.\n\n"}

CVP reflects the amount of blood returning to the heart and the ability of the heart to pump the blood back into the arterial system. CVP is often a good approximation of right atrial pressure (RAP), although the two terms are not identical, as a pressure differential can sometimes exist between the venae cavae and the right atrium. CVP and RAP can differ when arterial tone is altered. This can be graphically depicted as changes in the slope of the venous return plotted against right atrial pressure (where central venous pressure increases, but right atrial pressure stays the same; VR = CVP − RAP).\n\nCVP has been, and often still is, used as a surrogate for preload, and changes in CVP in response to infusions of intravenous fluid have been used to predict volume-responsiveness (i.e. whether more fluid will improve cardiac output). However, there is increasing evidence that CVP, whether as an absolute value or in terms of changes in response to fluid, does not correlate with ventricular volume (i.e. preload) or volume-responsiveness, and so should not be used to guide intravenous fluid therapy. Nevertheless, CVP monitoring is a useful tool to guide hemodynamic therapy. \nThe cardiopulmonary baroreflex responds to an increase in CVP by decreasing systemic vascular resistance while increasing heart rate and ventricular contractility in dogs.\n\nNormal CVP in patients can be measured from two points of reference:\n\n\nCVP can be measured by connecting the patient's central venous catheter to a special infusion set which is connected to a small diameter water column.

These sponsors include several video game marathons such as the Mario Marathon and Desert Bus for Hope, as well as YouTube series such as Far Lands or Bust by Kurtjmac.\n\nChild's Play was announced on November 24, 2003 by the authors of Penny Arcade as a challenge to their readership, and as a response to the often negative portrayal of video gamers in the media, most notably a HeraldNet article by Bill France entitled \"Violent video games are training children to kill.\" (France later made an apology in the same column, praising the effort.) It received positive press on many popular weblogs, including Slashdot and received direct endorsement from Wil Wheaton. In less than one month of publicity and operation, the charity raised over $250,000 in cash and toys for the Children's Hospital and Regional Medical Center in Seattle, Washington.\n\nIn 2004, the charity was expanded and partnered with children's hospitals in Seattle; Oakland, California; San Diego, California; Houston, Texas and Washington, D.C.\n\nBy January 5, 2005, when the final numbers for 2004 were tabulated, the charity had raised over $310,000 ($60,000 more than the previous year), and gained forty corporate sponsors in the process. Among these sponsors were Nintendo, Midway Games, Cerulean Studios, and THQ.\n\nIn 2005, the charity was again expanded to partner with an additional seven children's hospitals across the United States, as well as children's hospitals in Toronto and Halifax, Nova Scotia, Canada. It is also partnered with Alder Hey Children's Hospital in Liverpool, England. At the time when they stopped accepting donations, the community had raised $605,000. There was an auction to appear in a Penny Arcade comic strip at the 2005 Child's Play Charity Dinner. The winning bid of $20,000 was placed by Christian Boggs. Mr. Boggs also placed the winning bid on an original pencil sketch of the PAX 2005 program cover on eBay. 100% of the profits went to the American Red Cross.\n\nIn 2006, the charity was further expanded, adding four hospitals in the United States, two in Australia, and one in Egypt. In addition to this, on December 13, 2006 there was a charity dinner and auction, where items participants were able to bid on included a gaming day for four in the Penny Arcade office, an appearance in a Penny Arcade strip, a tour of Bungie and recording session for the voice of a character in Halo 3, and a two-year subscription to World of Warcraft and the Burning Crusade special edition signed by all the developers. The year 2006 also became the first time that the 1 million dollar mark was reached.\n\nIn 2007, the charity added a hospital each in Hawaii and New Zealand.\n\nDuring the 2008 Penny Arcade Expo, Harmonix announced that three songs from the Expo will be made available for download for the \"Rock Band\" video game. The proceeds of these three songs will go to the charity.\n\nOn November 13, 2009, Mike Krahulik announced that after one week, the Child's Play 2009 total had already reached $455,863.80.\n\nIn 2010, Epic Games held a vote-by-purchase event between July 29 and September 6 to determine the fate of a character, Clayton Carmine, in their upcoming game \"Gears of War 3\". Gamers voted by purchasing Xbox avatar T-shirts through Xbox live, or real life T-shirts at the San Diego Comic-Con, with all purchases counting towards the vote. The voting campaign raised over $150,000, all of which was donated to Child's Play.\n\nIn 2011, Mike Krahulik announced the first annual Child's Play Invitational Golf Tournament to be held at the Brookside Golf Course in Pasadena, California on June 5, 2011. All proceeds from the event go to the partner hospitals & facilities in the Child's Play network. The Golf Tournament was subsequently held at Angeles National Golf Course in Sunland, CA on June 8, 2012 and Inglewood Golf Club in Kenmore, WA on May 20, 2013.\n\nIn November 2013, Program Coordinator Jamie Dillion announced the first ever expansion of Child's Play to benefit children in domestic violence facilities. The program was announced as a pilot and is scheduled to expand to open applications in Spring 2014. The shelter program will provide a pre-built game cart with game system, television, and games and will serve emergency shelters, long term shelters, advocacy centers and more.\n\nIn 2016, the charity raised over $160k at their Annual Dinner Auction, provided nearly 30 grants to libraries, shelters, schools, trauma centers, transitional housing, day programs and more to help them purchase games and systems. Also helped supply VR setups to hospitals for therapy and distraction along with iPads to special education classrooms and inpatient psychiatric units.\n\nIn November 2017, former Program Coordinator Jamie Dillion posted on her tumblr a list of problems she has with the way the charity is currently being run, mainly around the lack of transparency of how donations are being spent and a lack of annual totals being announced since 2014. This post was acknowledged by a current Child's Play staff member during the live stream of Desert Bus For Hope 2017, but only provided the information that they have a blog post planned for when they aren't busy.\n\n\n"}

As with most fish oils, it contains the omega-3 fatty acids, eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA). Cod liver oil also contains vitamin A and vitamin D. Historically, it was given to children because vitamin D had been shown to prevent rickets, a consequence of vitamin D deficiency.\n\nCod liver oil has traditionally come in many grades. Cod liver oil for human consumption is pale and straw colored, with a mild flavor. Ancient Scandinavian Vikings produced cod liver oil by laying birch tree branches over a kettle of water, and fresh livers were laid over the branches. The water was brought to a boil and as the steam rose, the oil from the liver dripped into the water and was skimmed off. There was also a method for producing fresh raw cod liver oil.\nIn the Industrial Revolution, cod liver oil became popular for industrial purposes. Livers placed in barrels to rot, with the oil skimmed off over the season, was the main method for producing this oil. The resulting oil was brown and foul tasting. In the 1800s cod liver oil became popular as a medicine and both pale and brown oils were used. Brown oils were common because they were cheaper to produce. Some doctors believed in only using the fresh pale oil, while others believed the brown oil was better. However the brown oils tended to cause intestinal upset.\n\nThe Möller Process was invented by Peter Möller in 1850. The livers are ground with water into a slurry, then this is gently simmered until the oil rises to the top. The oil is skimmed off and purified. Other methods used in modern times include the Cold Flotation Process, Pressure Extraction, and Pressure Cooking. These all require further purification steps to get a pure oil.\nThough similar in fatty acid composition to other fish oils, cod liver oil has higher concentrations of vitamins A and D. According to the United States Department of Agriculture, a tablespoon (13.6 grams or 14.8 mL) of cod liver oil contains 4,080 μg of retinol (vitamin A) and 34 μg ( ) of vitamin D. The Dietary Reference Intake of vitamin A is 900 μg per day for adult men and 700 μg per day for women, while that for vitamin D is 15 μg per day. The Tolerable upper intake levels (ULs) are 3000 μg/day and 100 μg/day, respectively. People consuming cod liver oil as a source of omega-3 fatty acids should pay attention to how much vitamin A and vitamin D this adds to their diet.\n\nCod liver oil is approximately 20% omega-3 fatty acids. For this reason cod liver oil may be beneficial in secondary prophylaxis after a heart attack. Diets supplemented with cod liver oil have also been demonstrated to have beneficial effects on psoriasis.\n\nA tablespoon (13.6 g) of cod liver oil contains 136% of the UL for preformed vitamin A (retinol). Vitamin A accumulates in the liver, and can reach harmful levels sufficient to cause hypervitaminosis A. Pregnant women may want to consider consulting a doctor when taking cod liver oil because of the high amount of retinol. \n\nFatty acid oxidation and environmental toxins content are reduced when purification processes are applied to produce refined fish oil products. \n\nIn Newfoundland, cod liver oil was sometimes used as the liquid base for traditional red ochre paint, the coating of choice for use on outbuildings and work buildings associated with the cod fishery.\n\nIn Tübingen, Germany, drinking a glass of cod liver oil is the punishment for the loser at the traditional , a punting boat race by University of Tübingen groups.\n\n"}

Compassionate mind training helps transform problematic patterns of cognition and emotion related to anxiety, anger, shame, self-criticism, depersonalization, and hypomania.\n\nBiological evolution forms the theoretical backbone of CFT. Humans have evolved with at least three primal types of emotion regulation system: the threat (protection) system, the drive (resource-seeking) system, and the soothing system. CFT emphasizes the links between cognitive patterns and these three emotion regulation systems. Through the use of techniques such as compassionate mind training and cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT), psychotherapy clients can learn to manage each system more effectively and respond more appropriately to situations. There are an increasing number of empirical research papers that demonstrate the importance of compassion as a way of directing behavior to deal with threat and resolve conflict.\n\nCompassion focused therapy is especially appropriate for people who have high levels of shame and self-criticism and who have difficulty in feeling warmth toward, and being kind to, themselves or others. Such problems of shame and self-criticism are often rooted in a history of abuse, bullying, neglect, and/or lack of affection in the family. CFT can help such people learn to feel more safeness and warmth in their interactions with others and themselves.\n\nNumerous methods are used in CFT to develop a person's compassion. For example, people undergoing CFT are taught to understand compassion from the third person, before transferring these thought processes to themselves.\n\n"}
{"id": "25755219", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=25755219", "title": "Curry Awards", "text": "Curry Awards\n\nThe Curry Awards is an award given to curry restaurants in the United Kingdom, which have achieved \"total excellence\" in all departments by The Curry Club in association with its publication, The Good Curry Guide.\n\nThe Good Curry Guide Awards ceremony was established in May 1991 by Pat Chapman and was the first awards ceremony of any restaurant sector.\n\nPat Chapman’s first Good Curry Guide was published in 1984. About 600 Indian restaurants were selected for entry (out of the 4,000 that existed then) and it carried little critical information. The next edition (1987) addressed this by having critical entries from correspondents. No one restaurant was rated higher than any other. In other words neither of these editions named the ‘Best in Class’; Chapman considered that since only the top percentage achieved entry, all entries were ‘Good Curry Guide Restaurants’. The publication attracted considerable media attention. However journalists and food writers from such publications as The Evening Standard, The Daily Telegraph, The Times, and BBC Good Food Magazine pressured Chapman to name the best.\n\nChapman asked his correspondents which restaurants could qualify into a TOP 30 category (which became TOP 100 in 1995), and which could be best regionally and best in UK. The results were duly published in the 1991 Guide and to launch it Chapman decided to hold an Awards Ceremony for the winners. Unlike today, it was a time when there were few such ceremonies. Chapman modelled it on the Academy Award, by commencing with a formal presention of a certificate to each winner in turn before a group of their peers and media, and following with a luncheon to emphasise the event’s social side. On that first ceremony, there were eight winners, including Chutney Mary Indian restaurant London, SW10 as Best in UK, where the event was held. \nMedia and public response to this was enormous. So by the time the next GCG was due for publication, the TOP 30 was increased to the new TOP 100 category, and from that no less that 18 ‘Best in Category were to be awarded.\nIt was clear a bigger venue was needed, and one which was divorced from winning restaurants. Chapman had been to an Asian wedding at a Heathrow Hotel where the catering was by Madhu’s. Chapman suggested they did his catering and the Park Lane Hotel was chosen with a seating capacity of 330 seats. It was the first time Madhu’s had catered for any event other than Asian weddings. Chapman organised the entire event. Of the 300 seats, 80 were taken by media.\n\nBetween 18 and 20 Awards are given before an audience of restaurant personnel and their guests, sponsors, media, press and others, totalling some 800. \nThe luncheon is a major feature of the event. Catering for any event attended by others in the catering trade is a challenge; Chapman's Awards the more so. Being an Indian Restaurant event, the restaurateurs are from all countries of the subcontinent so it is no mean task for the caterer to satisfy 800 of his international peers, and one few caterers would attempt. \nThe event is widely reported in the UK and in the subcontinent, and it is televised by Sony Entertainment Television Asia and is screened and repeated in Australia, Canada, Europe, Pakistan, India, Mauritius, the Middle East, New Zealand, South Africa, the United Kingdom and the United States to millions of viewers.\n\nOf the 9,000 Indian restaurants in Britain, each of which are scrupulously examined, only seventy restaurants become shortlisted with four to each of the eighteen Award categories. Of these only eighteen win the Awards. That is one-in-500 or 0.2% (zero-point two) percentage of the total.\n\nThe Good Curry Guide Awards ceremony has been held each time a Good Curry Guide is published as follows: \nThe chief Award is the Best in the UK.\n\nRegional Awards\n\nThese 25 restaurants (and one group of 11) are located all over the UK, and are considered to be the best in their region. Each of these winners, has been visited by Pat Chapman during 2012/3 and presented with their Award Certificate.\n\n\nBEST UK GROUP ~ Akbars (11 restaurants): Bradford (2), Birmingham, Glasgow, Leeds (2), Manchester, Middlesbrough, Newcastle, Rotherham & York.\n\nBEST IN YORKSHIRE ~ Ashoka Sheffield\n\nBEST IN MERSEYSIDE ~ Gulshan Liverpool\n\nBEST IN NORTH EAST ~ Valley 397 Newcastle\n\n\nBEST IN MIDLANDS ~ Anoki Burton, Derby, Nottingham\n\nBEST IN EAST MIDLANDS ~ Curry Fever Leicester Leics\n\nBEST IN WEST MIDLANDS ~ Maharaja Birmingham West Midlands\n\nBEST IN CENTRAL ENGLAND ~ Calcutta Brasserie Milton Keynes Bucks\n\n\nBEST IN the SOUTH EAST ~ The Ambrette Margate Kent & Rye Sussex\n\nBEST ON SOUTH COAST ~ Bombay Bay, Southsea Hants\n\nBEST IN OUTER LONDON, WEST ~ Brilliant Southall, Middlesex\n\nBEST IN HOME COUNTIES, NORTH ~ Chez Mumtaj St Albans, Herts\n\nBEST IN SURREY ~ India Dining, Warlingham, Surrey\n\nBEST IN SOUTH ENGLAND ~ Massala, Cobham, Surrey\n\nBEST IN HOME COUNTIES, WEST ~ Mango Lounge Windsor Berks\n\nBEST IN OUTER LONDON, SOUTH ~ Sesame New Malden\n\n\nBEST IN THE WEST COUNTRY ~ Viceroy, Yeovil, Somerset\nBEST IN THE SOUTH WEST ~ Mysterica, Bristol\n\nBEST IN CORNWALL ~ Rajdoot, St Ives, Cornwall\n\n\nBEST OVERALL in SCOTLAND ~ Verandah Edinburgh\n\nBEST IN NORTH SCOTLAND ~ Balaka St Andrews Fife\n\nBEST IN EAST SCOTLAND ~ Mya, Edinburgh, Lothian\n\n\nBEST IN WALES ~ Moksh Cardiff Glamorgan\n\nBEST IN NORTH WALES ~ Bengal Dynasty Shotton & Llandudno\n\nCuisine Awards \"(Not Awarded in 2012/3)\"\n\nSpeciality Awards \"(Not Awarded in 2012/3)\"\n\nLifetime Achievement Award \"(Not Awarded in 2012/3)\"\n\nAwarded 2007 to Satish Arora, Chef Culinaire, Taj Group \n\nPat Chapman\n\nThe Curry Club\n\nGood Curry Guide\n\n • 1984 Good Curry Guide, Curry Club — \n\n • Good Curry Guide Award Ceremony 2007 http://www.patchapman.co.uk/catalogue/product/914/2461\n\n"}

Defensive wounds are often found on the hands and forearms, where the victim has raised them to protect the head and face or to fend off an assault, but may also be present on the feet and legs where a victim attempts defense while lying down and kicking out at the assailant.\n\nThe appearance and nature of the wound varies with the type of weapon used and the location of the injury, and may present as a laceration, abrasion, contusion or bone fracture. Where a victim has time to raise hands or arms before being shot by an assailant, the injury may also present as a gunshot wound. Severe laceration of the palmar surface of the hand or partial amputation of fingers may result from the victim grasping the blade of a weapon during an attack. In forensic pathology the presence of defense wounds is highly indicative of homicide and also proves that the victim was, at least initially, conscious and able to offer some resistance during the attack.\n\nDefense wounds may be classified as active or passive. A victim of a knife attack, for example, would receive active defense wounds from grasping at the knife's blade, and passive defense wounds on the back of the hand if it was raised up to protect the face.\n"}

{"id": "10228998", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=10228998", "title": "Dried blood spot", "text": "Dried blood spot\n\nDried blood spot testing (DBS) is a form of biosampling where blood samples are blotted and dried on filter paper. The dried samples can easily be shipped to an analytical laboratory and analysed using various methods such as DNA amplification or HPLC.\n\nThe concept that capillary blood, obtained from pricking the heel or finger and blotted onto filter paper, could be used to screen for metabolic diseases in large populations of neonates was introduced in Scotland by Robert Guthrie in 1963. Neonatal screening for phenylketonuria became nationwide in 1969-70. Since then, Guthrie card samples have been collected routinely from infants in over 20 countries to screen for phenylketonuria and more recently for congenital hypothyroidism, sickle cell disorders and HIV infection. The limitations of sensitivity and specificity when screening such small volumes of blood restricted the use of dried blood spots for many years. However, recent advances such as the production of monoclonal antibodies, expression of synthetic proteins, and the introduction of the polymerase chain reaction have overcome many of these problems.\n\nThis type of blood testing is now available for use at home by consumers in the U.S. Available blood tests include vitamin D, estrogen, testosterone, cortisol, TSH and lipids. New York is the only state that prohibits home blood spot testing.\n\nDried blood spot specimens are collected by applying a few drops of blood, drawn by lancet from the finger, heel or toe, onto specially manufactured absorbent filter paper. The blood is allowed to thoroughly saturate the paper and is air dried for several hours. Specimens are stored in low gas-permeability plastic bags with desiccant added to reduce humidity, and may be kept at ambient temperature, even in tropical climates.\n\nOnce in the laboratory, technicians separate a small disc of saturated paper from the sheet using an automated or manual hole punch, dropping the disc into a flat bottomed microtitre plate. The blood is eluted out in phosphate buffered saline containing 0.05% Tween 80 and 0.005% sodium azide, overnight at 4 °C. The resultant plate containing the eluates forms the \"master\" from which dilutions can be made for subsequent testing.\n\nAs an alternative to punching out a paper disc, recent automation solutions extract the sample by flushing an eluent through the filter without punching it out. An automation including the application of an internal standard prior extraction was developed by the Swiss company CAMAG.\n\nThe technology holds promise for expanding diagnostic services to HIV-infected infants in resource-poor settings due to the samples' longer lifespan with reduced need for refrigeration and the less invasive nature of the test compared with other methods. Unlike ELISA testing for HIV-antibodies in the blood, which may be transmitted to infants in pregnancy independently of the virus itself, dried blood spot testing can be used to detect genetic material of the actual virus, thereby avoiding the likelihood of a false positive result. \nDried blood spot testing for HIV is not considered sensitive enough for diagnostic testing, but may be useful in estimating prevalence of HIV through surveillance. \nDBS specimens also pose less of a biohazard risk to handlers, and are easier to transport or store than liquid blood specimens.\n\nThe reason for stability of DNA, RNA or protein could be attributed to the fact that the biological material binds to the matrix of the filter paper and the process of drying excludes water which is an important factor necessary for protease or nuclease to act. Binding of the biological material also binds several inhibitors which may interfere with various nucleic acid amplification methods.\n\n"}
{"id": "36564536", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=36564536", "title": "Family support", "text": "Family support\n\nFamily support is the support of families with a member with a disability, which may include a child, an adult or even the parent in the family. In the United States, family support includes \"unpaid\" or \"informal\" support by neighbors, families and friends, \"paid services\" through specialist agencies providing an array of services termed \"family support services\", school or parent services for special needs such as respite care, specialized child care or peer companions, or cash subsidies, tax deductions or other financial subsidies. Family support has been extended to different population groups in the US and worldwide. Family support services is currently a \"community services and funding\" stream in New York and the US which has had variable \"application\" based on disability group, administrating agency, and even, regulatory and legislative intent.\n\nThe late 1970s and early 1980s are considered pivotal times for the development of respite and family support services, particularly through the demands and initiatives of parents of children with disabilities. These initiatives occurred throughout the US concurrent with the formation of activist parent groups in the 1970s, for example, in the state of New Hampshire. Foster care, which involved \"substitute care\" from birth families, preceded this organization of parents nationally and together with group homes were considered the primary forms of community residential services in the US. However, by the 1990s, family support had become an established service reported regularly in the field of intellectual and developmental disabilities, and part of States' and local service systems in the US. Family support services were considered one of the better ways of supporting families and their children, including \"building on natural supports\" and encouraging the integration of children in the community.\n\nBy the early 1980s, states such as New York had established family support programs and agencies, New York State Office of Mental Retardation and Developmental Disabilities, and \"model programs\" were identified nationally which served children and their families in the community (e.g., MacComb-Oakland, Michigan, Dane, LaCrosse, and Columbia counties, Wisconsin). New models of family support services were initiated, including professional models which involved both traditional respite for the families (i.e., opportunity for a break from the stress of caring for children with \"special needs\") and individual recreation opportunities in generic agencies/sites for the son or daughter (versus traditional in-home babysitting/child care). Professional parents sought to have respite places available in group homes (e.g., friend of the home), to develop small group respite settings, to hold parent-to-parent support groups and meetings, to establish councils, and to have cash subsidies to meet the extra expenses of raising a \"disabled child\" (e.g., Exceptional Family Resources, Syracuse, New York, 1985). By 1983, the State of New York had funded three major demonstration grants and then Governor Mario Cuomo and his wife Matilda held the first Family Support Conference in the Albany, New York. New York State indeed by 1988 reported $16,536,000 in discrete family support initiatives which did not include new agency family/cash subsidy demonstrations funded later in 1989-1990 in the state. or agency cash subsidies included as part of family support demonstration programs (e.g., recreation/respite in generic agencies). In the public policy arena, respite was often explored in the context of child care for children with disabilities, and additional expenses of raising a child with a disability as especially critical in low income families.\n\nIn 1985, Syracuse University's Center on Human Policy was awarded a three-year Community Integration Project from the Federal Government (National Institute on Disability Research and Rehabilitation) to work with states and communities in the US. The project, based on a national search conducted by the Wisconsin Developmental Disabilities Council, identified state cash subsidy programs in 21 states in the US. The project, together with a new national Center on Community Integration, prepared information on family support for distribution, including a news bulletin on family support based on the project's research studies, an article on the case for family support for families, bibliographic references, innovative agencies and organizations, and an introduction to family support issues, such as family-centered supports, individualized and flexible supports, empowering families, use of natural, community supports, and permanency planning.\n\nFamily support is based in part on theories related to families, particularly family systems theory, ecological and support theories, community support theories, life-span and life course theories, family psychosocial theories, family empowerment theory, and positivistic theories, such as the sociology of acceptance. In relation to services, basic policy concepts have included family-centeredness, capacity-based services, empowerment and participatory decision making, individualized (and appropriate) services, among others. Between the 1970s and 1990s, family support was developed in the context of community integration, building on the quarter century work on physical and social integration of families and their children. It differs from other models of family support developed in the context of employment programs, housing programs, nutrition, transportation, health care, or city emergency programs. These included: the Family Support Services of West Hawaii (including community and economic development activities), Family Support Services of Amarillo (including employee assistance and family therapy), Family Support Services of Southeastern Pennsylvania (e.g., child welfare and early intervention), City of Chicago Family and Support Services (e.g., domestic violence, senior services).(brief web review, 2011).\n\nBy the 1990s, family support had gained in great popularity in the field of intellectual disabilities, especially since 80-90% of children with disabilities continue to live with their families even today. Yet, the Human Services Research Institute determined that only 1.5% of the state budgets for developmental disabilities services was used to support these families as at 1990. By 2006, family support spending was reported to be $2,305,149,428 in the US, yet, in FY 2006, it remained at only 5% of total intellectual and developmental disabilities spending of $43.84 billion. In the US, the costs of \"family care\" in intellectual and developmental disabilities have been studied, including direct financial costs met by families, indirect and opportunity costs, and indirect psychological costs.\n\nIn related fields, though, family support is still often considered to be \"unpaid\", \"voluntary support\" by family members, family-to-family training programs, self-help groups, often near forms of family interventions by professionals (e.g., behavioral training, clinical assessments, vocational training, family therapy, clinical community re-entry) in traumatic brain injury. and in adult mental health. In children's mental health, family support and advocacy organizations are viewed to be increasing at the systems and policy levels, with the late 1980s formation of the Federation of Families for Children's Mental Health and the reformation of the National Alliance on Mental Illness, a strong parent organization from the late 1970s (see, also Wikipedia). Family support services today are viewed as important for families with individuals with diverse disabilities (e.g., motor-neuron disease, AIDS, epilepsy, cerebral palsy, autism)with a greater emphasis on choice in support services (e.g., counseling, training and information, respite).\n\nAs family support would be considered a parent-professional field, the research studies documented diverse disabilities (e.g., epilepsy, sickle cell anemia, hearing/visual impairment, spina bifida, cancer, learning disability), household incomes, level of assistance by daily living activities, behavioral and medical needs, insurance coverage, daily routines, impact of disability on the household, services for specialized needs, and so forth. The field then was challenged in the 1990s to broaden approaches to families, including gendered caring, inner-city population groups, rural areas of the country, a \"whatever it takes approach\", and over-professionalized approaches to people's homes. This was followed by a national research study on these organizations supporting families in the community and those supporting adults with disabilities to live in their own homes., two major national and international comprehensive reform efforts in community living. Baltimore, MD: Paul H. Brookes. In addition, governmental policy today appears to continue to encourage adults with disabilities to live at home with parents or caregivers (2011); thus, family support funds are usually designated for families with children and adults living at home, including in families with aging parents. However, family supports are also integral to adoptive and foster families and may take the form of in-home aides or home assistance, provision of equipment, respite and home adaptations, and shared care options between birth and foster parents/families.\n\nIn line with the parent-professional partnerships of the 1980s and 1990s, the Oregon Research Institute published a book on \"Support for caregiving families\". The book included the progressive professional stances on family stress and support (for critique, see Racino & Heumann, on children as a \"burden\"), value-based services based on the Center on Human Policy's statement in support for children and their families (1987), role of parents in quality services, coping skills (often addressed by behavioral or skills training), human development and informal support, and family life cycles, including infants and early intervention, school-aged children (school programs), transition to adulthood (and supported employment), and ecobehavioral/clinical treatment of families (stronger in fields such as mental health), among others. Family support and aging, a major concern in 2000s due to the aging population in the US, was also the focus of service reform in the 1990s. For example, 700,000 people with developmental disabilities live with one or more parent over the age of 65.\n\nAs deinstitutionalization policies in the US moved toward the development of community services, community parents also became more interested in \"out-of-home placements\" (e.g., small group homes) of their children (e.g., children moving from the parental home and beginning adult lives). This approach is valued internationally as one way of adult's attaining adult status, especially in Western countries. In states like New York and Connecticut, this resulted in tension between \"institutional\" and \"community parents\" vying for limited public funds, and between providers of services for funding (e.g., state institutions and private, non-profit community sectors). However, as states began to close institutions, funding was often available primarily to relocate those individuals living in institutional care or those at risk of institutionalization (e.g., home and community-based Medicaid waiver, HCBS). For example, \"15 states financed 90% or more of their family support services with Medicaid HCBS; 11 states financed their family support activities through state funding. Since family supports were recommended for children, options such as foster care (new models for adults and children)often included family support services, families on waiting lists were offered family support services, and a broader range of types of services were developed in different states (e.g., Wisconsin's menu of services).\n\nIn the 2000s, \"new population groups\" in family support, as part of family support theories in the US and worldwide, included:\n\nTraditional groups known to be at-risk of adolescent mothers were sometimes involved in social support and adolescent theories, as part of adolescent pregnancies and mothering research. At-risk families in intellectual disabilities also may be single mothers and early recommendations were for additional support options such as boarding nearby to family, modifying apartment programs to allow children, and increasing family support services in private homes. Critical are personal and family values, empowerment of families and home visitors, parent-child activities, and cluster groups (e.g., neighborhood improvement, natural child birth groups, toddler play groups, team group support), among others (e.g., Cochran, et al., 1984).\n\nIn addition, the needs of multicultural families, based on changing US demographics, also resulted in greater attention to the major minority groups, including African-Americans, Asian Americans, native Indian Americans, and Hispanic/Latino Americans. Original approaches involved services to Native Americans on reservations (often poverty) or as \"assimilation into white society\" in contrast to approaches involving housing integration of \"diverse populations\" (e.g., Asian Americans) in mixed-income housing in small cities. Today (2012), the American Indians, for example, own and operate casino gambling in the US and obtain funds toward their own social services. In addition, new transnational families, who may be separated from their families by international migration, form part of the new face of families in the US as does the gay, lesbian, bisexual, and transgender activist populations.\n\nYouth with disabilities became an emerging \"age group\" in the late 1980s and 1990s as family approaches (often-parent-based) competed with approaches based more on the desires of youth with disabilities. For example, personal assistance approaches based on diverse lifestyles and hiring of aides by service users became a popular way of thinking about services. In addition, major federal initiatives in transition planning in the US resulted in a variety of approaches to moving from child-centered to adult services, based in part, upon theories of adolescent development. Today, self-advocacy has grown worldwide and youth, in particular, have sought their own voices and futures.\n\nThe changing demographics of aging in the US have been well documented in diverse fields with its public facing the need to revamp the nation's Social Security system. The latter can no longer, as developed in the Depression Era, financially support the growing aging population which outstrips the younger generation paying into the system. For example, \"between 2010 and 2030, the number of people aged 65 and older is projected to increase by 76%, while the number of workers supporting the system is projected to increase by 8%\". The elder population also is living longer, expected to have a marked increase in the people living over the age of 80, involving an increase in \"disabilities\" such as dementia (e.g., Public Broadcasting, 2011), effecting social security disability benefits, and also the discovery of older adults with lifelong disabilities in \"community-dwelling\" two generation families.\n\nInstead of family support in the field of mental health, parent organizations have formed state and national chapters independent of their children (e.g., National Alliance for the Mentally Ill). In addition, community agencies often have developed parent education programs (which remains as a government-funded program in the US), and family therapists and counselors (often in private practice) tend to work with the whole family. Personal assistance and independent living approaches tend to begin with the desires and wishes of the youth or adult, and less often, the children; these approaches in mental health still remain relatively uncommon though psychosocial approaches have some similarity. While housing and support and employment supports have been transferred across fields, greater reluctance exists in the field of mental health for \"family support\" (often starting with parental concerns) who often bill the parents as secondary service recipients.\n\nIn psychiatric rehabilitation, \"families are a major resource impacting rehabilitation outcome\" (families as allies) with 50-60% returning home from hospitals in US (Anthony, et al., 2002, p. 185). Extended families are viewed as critical worldwide, and many approaches are categorized as \"family management\" (e.g., information, treatments, family management), family interventions or \"psychoeducational\" (Ibid, 2002). However, leading national research centers in the US examined state service systems and recommended prevention and family support for children in mental health and their families. Such \"ecologically-grounded models\" which are expected to improve or \"mediate child and parent outcomes\" have often been the first targeted in difficult economic times; the \"full fledged family support movement\" of community-based agencies was reported in 1992 as \"struggling to operationalize a new set of services and a new way of doing business with families\".\n\nBy the 2000s, internationally, the support of parents who themselves have intellectual disabilities moved to new prominence with extensive, multi-decade research after initial programs and studies in the US as early as the late 1980s and 1990s. In addition, traditional parent training programs moved to community building and parents/mothers with physical disabilities also prominently advocated for better lifestyles for themselves and their children, included as part of a new US National Resource Center for Parents with Disabilities. (April 1998). Through the Looking Glass administered the 5 year center on behalf of the \"8 million American families in which one or both parents has a disability.\"\n\nIn 2015, partially as a result of the Iraq and Afghanistan wars, veterans are returning home with head and brain injuries, and then return from hospital and rehabilitation to spouse and family. Common may be a referral to a support group for the spouse or caregiver who may experience \"caregiver stress\" and \"burden of care\", the result of inadequate community services in homes and for families. In addition, brain or head injuries can be caused by vehicular accidents, sports injuries, falls or accidents, war and terrorism, and related medical conditions (e.g., brain tumor, stroke). Family support in these fields often refers to support groups or direct support from the family and neighbors to the individual with the brain injury, or the rehabilitation or hospital program as the family support.\n\nIn the National Goals and Research for People with Intellectual and Developmental Disabilities, support of families and family life across the lifespan was considered one of the major goals of the extensive work group of leaders in that field (e.g., Ann Turnbull, Rud Turnbull, John Agosta, Elizabeth Erwin, Glenn Fujuira, George Singer, and Leslie Sodak, among others). The overarching goal was: To support the caregiving efforts and enhance the quality of life of all families so that families will remain the core unit of American society. The five subgoals include:\nSuch efforts are critical as the US has often been criticized for having a lack of a coherent family policy for all its people (e.g., health care, housing, employment, leisure, community and economic development).\n\nFamily support is indeed an international initiative with 1994 the International Year of the Family as proclaimed by the United Nations. Helle Mittler, from Great Britain, reported on the TASK Force of the International League of Societies for Persons with Mental Handicap which highlighted Face to Face in the United Kingdom, Young Muslim Women's Association Comprehensive Programme in Jordan, Service Brokerage in Canada, Swasahaya Sumachaya, Mysore, and Karnataka Parents' Association in India, Market Place Support Group in Côte d'Ivoire, Africa, Brothers and Sisters Groups in Nicaragua and India, Fathers' group in the United Kingdom, and Parents and Professionals Learning Together in Bangladesh and Pakistan.\n\nIn 2012, the international community is on individual and family life quality, family support is a long term services and supports (LTSS) in the US in communities and a new chapter, \"Family theories, family support and family studies\" will be released in 2014.\n\n\nhttps://www.usa.gov/disability-services"}
{"id": "1671777", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1671777", "title": "Fasciola gigantica", "text": "Fasciola gigantica\n\nFasciola gigantica is a parasitic flatworm of the class Trematoda, which causes tropical fascioliasis. It is regarded as one of the most important single platyhelminth infections of ruminants in Asia and Africa. Estimates of infection rates are as high as 80-100% in some countries. The infection is commonly called fasciolosis.\n\nThe prevalence of \"F. gigantica\" often overlaps with that of \"Fasciola hepatica\", and the two species are so closely related in terms of genetics, behaviour, and morphological and anatomical structures that it is notoriously difficult to distinguish them. Therefore, sophisticated molecular techniques are required to correctly identify and diagnose the infection.\n\n\"Fasciola gigantica\" causes outbreaks in tropical areas of southern Asia, Southeast Asia, and Africa. The geographical distribution of \"F. gigantica\" overlaps with \"Fasciola hepatica\" in many African and Asian countries and sometimes in the same country, although in such cases the ecological requirement of the flukes and their snail host are distinct. Infection is most prevalent in regions with intensive sheep and cattle production. In Egypt \"F. gigantica\" has existed in domestic animals since the times of the pharaohs.\n\nThe life cycle of \"Fasciola gigantica\" is as follows: eggs (transported with feces) → eggs hatch → miracidium → miracidium infect snail intermediate host → (parthenogenesis in 24 hours) sporocyst → redia → daughter redia → cercaria → (gets outside the snail) → metacercaria → infection of the host → adult stage produces eggs. \nAs with other trematodes, \"Fasciola\" develop in a molluscan intermediate host. Species of the freshwater snails from the family Lymnaeidae are well known for their role as intermediate hosts in the life cycle of \"Fasciola gigantica\"; however, throughout the years an increasing number of other molluscan intermediate hosts of \"F. gigantica\" have been reported. It has been reported that the Lymnaeid intermediate hosts of \"F. gigantica\" are distinguishable from those of \"F. hepatica\", both morphologically and as to habitat requirement. The species of \"Fasciola\" can become adapted to new intermediate hosts under certain conditions at least based on laboratory trials. The most important intermediate host for \"F. gigantica\" is \"Radix auricularia\". However, other species are also known to harbour the fluke including \"Lymnaea rufescens\" and \"Lymnaea acuminata\" in the Indian Subcontinent; \"Radix rubiginosa\" and \"Radix natalensis\" in Malaysia and in Africa respectively; and the synonymous \"Lymnaea cailliaudi\" in east Africa. Other snails also serve as natural or experimental intermediate such as \"Austropeplea ollula\", \"Austropeplea viridis\", \"Radix peregra\", \"Radix luteola\", \"Pseudosuccinea columella\" and \"Galba truncatula\". The Australian \"Lymnaea tomentosa\" (host of \"F. hepatica\") was shown to be receptive to miracidia of \"F. gigantica\" from East Africa, Malaysia and Indonesia.\n\n\"Fasciola gigantica\" is a causative agents (together with \"Fasciola hepatica\") of fascioliasis in ruminants and in humans worldwide.\n\nThe parasite infects cattle and buffalo and can also be seen regionally in goats, sheep, and donkeys.\n\nInfection with \"Fasciola\" spp. occurs when metacercariae are accidentally ingested on raw vegetation. The metacercariae exist in the small intestine, and move through the intestinal wall and peritoneal cavity to the liver where adults mature in the biliary ducts of the liver. Eggs are passed through the bile ducts into the intestine where they are then passed in the feces.\n\nDespite the importance to differentiate between the infection by either fasciolid species, due to their distinct epidemiological, pathological and control characteristics, there is, unfortunately, coprological (excretion-related) or immunological diagnosis are difficult. Especially in humans, specific detection by clinical, pathological, coprological or immunological methods are unreliable. Molecular assays are the only promising tools, such as PCR-RFLP assay, and the very rapid loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP).\n\nTriclabendazole is the drug of choice in fasciolosis as it is highly effective against both mature and immature flukes. Artemether has been demonstrated \"in vitro\" to be equally effective. Though slightly less potent, artesunate is also useful in human fasciolosis.\n\nThis article incorporates CC-BY-3.0 text from references.\n"}
{"id": "1349358", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1349358", "title": "Fasciola hepatica", "text": "Fasciola hepatica\n\nFasciola hepatica, also known as the common liver fluke or sheep liver fluke, is a parasitic trematode (fluke or flatworm, a type of helminth) of the class Trematoda, phylum Platyhelminthes. It infects the livers of various mammals, including humans. The disease caused by the fluke is called fasciolosis or fascioliasis, which is a type of helminthiasis and has been classified as a neglected tropical disease. Fasciolosis is currently classified as a plant/food-borne trematode infection, often acquired through eating the parasite's metacercariae encysted on plants. \"F. hepatica\", which is distributed worldwide, has been known as an important parasite of sheep and cattle for decades and causes significant economic losses in these livestock species, up to £23 million in the UK alone. Because of its relatively large size and economic importance, it has been the subject of many scientific investigations and may be the best-known of any trematode species. \"F. hepatica's\" closest relative is \"Fasciola gigantica\". These two flukes are sister species; they share many morphological features and can mate with each other.\n\n\"Fasciola hepatica\" occurs in the liver of a definitive host and its lifecycle is indirect. Definitive hosts of the fluke are cattle, sheep, and buffaloes. Wild ruminants and other mammals, including humans, can act as definitive hosts as well. The life cycle of \"F. hepatica\" goes through the intermediate host and several environmental larval stages. Intermediate hosts of \"F. hepatica\" are air-breathing freshwater snails from the family Lymnaeidae. Although several lymnaeid species susceptible to \"F. hepatica\" have been described, the parasite develops only in one or two major species on each continent. \"Galba truncatula\" is the main snail host in Europe, partly in Asia, Africa, and South America. \"Lymnaea viator\", \"L. neotropica\", \"Pseudosuccinea columella\", and \"L. cubensis\" are most common intermediate hosts in Central and South America. Several other lymnaeid snails may be naturally or experimentally infected with \"F. hepatica\", but their role in transmission of the fluke is low. The list of lymnaeid snails that may serve as natural or experimental intermediate hosts of \"F. hepatica\" include:\n\n\nThe metacercariae are released from the freshwater snail as cercariae, and form cysts on various surfaces including aquatic vegetation. The mammalian host then eats this vegetation and can become infected. Humans can often acquire these infections through eating freshwater plants such as watercress. Inside the duodenum of the mammalian host, the metacercariae are released from within their cysts. From the duodenum, they burrow through the lining of the intestine and into the peritoneal cavity. They then migrate through the intestines and liver, and into the bile ducts. Inside the bile ducts, they develop into an adult fluke. In humans, the time taken for \"F. hepatica\" to mature from metacercariae into an adult fluke is roughly 3 to 4 months. The adult flukes can then produce up to 25,000 eggs per fluke per day. These eggs are passed out via stools and into freshwater. Once in freshwater, the eggs become embryonated, allowing them to hatch as miracidia, which then find a suitable intermediate snail host of the Lymnaeidae family. Inside this snail, the miracidia develop into sporocysts, then to rediae, then to cercariae. The cercariae are released from the snail to form metacercariae and the life cycle begins again.\n\n\"Fasciola hepatica\" is one of the largest flukes of the world, reaching a length of 30 mm and a width of 13 mm (\"Fasciola gigantica\", though, is even bigger and can reach up to 75 mm). It is leaf-shaped, pointed at the back (posteriorly), and wide in the front (anteriorly). The oral sucker is small but powerful and is located at the end of a cone-shape projection at the anterior end. The acetabulum is a larger sucker than the oral sucker and is located at the anterior end.\n\nThe outer surface of the fluke is called the tegument. This is composed of scleroprotein, and its primary function is to protect the fluke from the destructive digestive system of the host. Its also used for renewal of the surface plasma membrane and the active uptake of nutrients. On the surface of the tegument are also small spines. Initially, these spines are single-pointed, then, just prior to the fluke entering the bile ducts, they become multipointed. At the anterior end of the fluke, the spines have between 10 and 15 points, whereas at the posterior end, they have up to 30 points. The tegument is a syncytial epithelium. This means it is made from the fusion of many cells, each containing one nucleus, to produce a multinucleated cell membrane. In the case of \"F. hepatica\", no nuclei are in the outer cytoplasm between the basal and apical membranes. Thus, this region is referred to as anucleate. Instead, the nuclei are found in the cell bodies, also known as tegumental cells, these connect to the outer cytoplasm via thin cytoplasmic strands. The tegumental cells contain the usual cytoplasmic organelles (mitochondria, Golgi bodies, and endoplasmic reticulum). The tegument plays a key role in the fluke’s infection of the host. Studies have shown that certain parts of the tegument (in this case, the antigen named Teg) can actually suppress the immune response of the mammalian host. This means that the fluke is able to weaken the immune response, and increase its chances of a successful infection. A successful infection is needed for the fluke to have enough time to develop into an adult and continue its lifecycle.\n\nThe alimentary canal of \"F. hepatica\" has a single mouth which leads into the blind gut; it has no anus. The mouth is located within the anterior sucker on the ventral side of the fluke. This mouth leads to the pharynx, which is then followed by a narrow oesophagus. The oesophagus, which is lined with a thin layer of epithelial cells, then opens up into the large intestine. As no anus is present, the intestine branches, with each branch ending blindly near the posterior end of the body. Flukes migrate into smaller capillaries and bile ducts when feeding within the host. They use their mouth suckers to pull off and suck up food, bile, lymph, and tissue pieces from the walls of the bile ducts. \"F. hepatica\" relies on extracellular digestion which occurs within the intestine of the host. The waste materials are egested through the mouth. The nonwaste matter is adsorbed back in through the tegument and the general surface of the fluke. The tegument facilitates this adsorption by containing many small folds to increase the surface area.\n\n\"F. hepatica\" has no respiratory organs: the adult flukes respire anaerobically (without oxygen). Glycogen taken from within the host is broken down by glycolysis to produce carbon dioxide and fatty acids. This process provides the fluke with energy.\nIn contrast, the free-living miracidia stages of the parasite generally develop within oxygen-rich environments. The free-living stages of the parasite are thought to respire aerobically, to gain the most energy from their environment.\n\n\"F. hepatica's\" excretory system contains a network of tubules surrounding one main excretory canal. This canal leads to the excretory pore at the posterior end of the fluke. This main canal branches into four sections within the dorsal and ventral regions of the body. The role of \"F. hepatica's\" excretory system is excretion and osmoregulation. Each tubule within the excretory system is connected to a flame cell, otherwise known as protonephridia. These cells are modified parenchyme cells. In \"F. hepatica\", their role is to perform excretion, but more importantly, osmoregulatory functions. Flame cells are therefore primarily used to remove excess water.\n\nThe nerve system of \"F. hepatica\" consists of a pair of nerve ganglia, each one is located on either side of the oesophagus. Around the oesophagus is a nerve ring, which connects the two nerve ganglia together. The nerves stem from this ring, reaching the posterior end of the body. At the posterior end, one pair of nerves becomes thicker than the others; these are known as the lateral nerve cords. From these lateral nerve cords, the other nerves branch. Sensory organs are absent from \"F. hepatica\".\n\n\"F. hepatica\" adult flukes are hermaphrodite; each contains both male and female reproductive organs. The male and female reproductive organs open up into the same chamber within the body, which is called the genital atrium. The genital atrium is an ectodermal sac which opens up to the outside of the fluke via a genital pore. The testes are formed of two branched tubules, these are located in the middle and posterior regions of the body. From the epithelium lining of the tubules, sperm is produced. The sperm then passes into the vas deferens and then into the seminal vesicle. From the seminal vesicle projects the ejaculatory duct, and this opens into the genital atrium, and many prostate glands surround this opening. The right side of the anterior testis has a branched, tubular ovary. From here, a short oviduct passes to the vitelline duct. This duct connects, via a junction, the ovaries, the uterus, and the yolk reservoir. From this junction, the uterus opens into the genital atrium; this opening is surrounded by Mehlis glands. In some flukes, the terminal end of the uterus is strengthened with muscles and spines.\n\n\"F. hepatica\" reproduces both sexually, via the hermaphrodite adult flukes, and asexually. The miracidia can reproduce asexually within the intermediate snail host.\n\nCurrently, \"F. hepatica\" has one of the widest geographical spread of any parasitic and vector-borne disease. Originating in Europe, it has expanded to colonize over 50 countries, covering all continents except Antarctica. In contrast, \"F. gigantica\" is generally considered more geographically restricted to the tropical regions of Africa, Asia, and the Middle East, with some overlap between the two species.\n\nClimate affects both \"F. hepatica\" and its intermediate host, the snail. For example, the development of \"F. hepatica\" miracidia and larvae, and the reproduction of \"Galba truncatula\", require a temperature range of 10 to 25 °C. In addition, they both require high levels of moisture in the air, as both are at risk of desiccation. Due to this, the prevalence, along with the intensity of infection, of \"F. hepatica\" is primarily dependent on rainfall levels and temperature.\n\n\"F. hepatica’s\" tegument protects it from the enzymes of the host's stomach, whilst still allowing water to pass through. Free-swimming larvae have cilia and the cercariae have a flagellum-like tail to help them swim through the aquatic environment and also allow them to reach the plants on which they form a cyst. To attach within the host, \"F. hepatica\" has oral suckers and body spines. Their pharynges also help them to suck onto the tissues within the body, particularly within the bile ducts. The adult fluke's respiration is anaerobic; this is ideal, as no oxygen is available in the liver. \"F. hepatica\" is adapted to produce a large number of eggs, which increases its chances of survival, as many eggs are destroyed on release into the environment. Also, \"F. hepatica\" is hermaphrodite, thus all flukes can produce eggs, increasing the number of offspring produced by the population.\n\nThe genome for \"F. hepatica\" was published in 2015. At 1.3 Gb, its genome is one of the largest known pathogen genomes. The genome contains many polymorphisms, and this represents the potential for the fluke to evolve and rapidly adapt to changes in the environment, such as host availability and drug or vaccine interventions.\n\n\"For more information on the epidemiology – see the disease page, fasciolosis\"\n\nInfection begins when cyst-covered aquatic vegetation is eaten or when water containing metacercariae is drunk. In the United Kingdom, \"F. hepatica\" frequently causes disease in ruminants, most commonly between March and December.\n\nHumans become infected by eating watercress or by drinking 'Emoliente', a Peruvian drink that uses drops of watercress juice. Cattle and sheep are infected when they consume the infectious stage of the parasite from low-lying, marshy pasture.\n\nHuman infections have been reported from more than 75 countries around the world. In Asia and Africa, people are infected both by \"F. hepatica\" and \"F. gigantica\" whereas human fasciolosis is caused only by \"F. hepatica\" in South and Central America and Europe.\n\nThe presence of \"F. hepatica\" can interfere with the detection of bovine tuberculosis in cattle. Cattle co-infected with \"F. hepatica\", compared to those infected with \"M. bovis\" alone, react weakly to the single intradermal comparative cervical tuberculin (SICCT) test. Therefore, an infection from \"F. hepatica\" can make it difficult to detect bovine tuberculosis, this is, of course, a major problem in the farming industry.\n\nBoth \"F. hepatica\" and \"F. gigantica\" can cause fasciolosis. Human symptoms vary depending on whether the disease is chronic or acute. During the acute phase, the immature worms begin penetrating the gut, causing symptoms of fever, nausea, swollen liver, skin rashes, and extreme abdominal pain. The chronic phase occurs when the worms mature in the bile duct, and can cause symptoms of intermittent pain, jaundice, and anemia. In cattle and sheep, classic signs of fasciolosis include persistent diarrhea, chronic weight loss, anemia, and reduced milk production. Some remain asymptomatic. \"F. hepatica\" can cause sudden death in both sheep and cattle, due to internal hemorrhaging and liver damage.\n\nFasciolosis is an important cause of both production and economic losses in the dairy and meat industries. Over the years, the prevalence has increased and it is likely to continue increasing in the future. Livestock are often treated with flukicides, chemicals toxic to flukes, including bromofenofos, triclabendazole, and bithionol. Ivermectin, which is widely used for many helminthic parasites, has low effectivity against \"F. hepatica\", as does praziquantel. For humans, the type of control depends on the setting. One important method is through the strict control over the growth and sales of edible water plants such as watercress. This is particularly important in highly endemic areas. Some farms are irrigated with polluted water, hence, vegetables farmed from such land should be thoroughly washed and cooked before being eaten.\n\nThe best way to prevent fasciolosis is by reducing the lymnaeid snail population or separating livestock from areas with these snails. These two methods are not always the most practical, so control by treating the herd before they are potentially infected is commonly practiced.\n\nA diagnosis may be made by finding yellow-brown eggs in the stool. They are indistinguishable from the eggs of \"Fascioloides magna\", although the eggs of \"F. magna\" are very rarely passed in sheep, goats, or cattle. If a patient has eaten infected liver, and the eggs pass through the body and out via the faeces, a false positive result to the test can occur. Daily examination during a liver-free diet will unmask this false diagnosis.\n\nAn enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) test is the diagnostic test of choice. ELISA is available commercially and can detect antihepatica antibodies in serum and milk; new tests intended for use on faecal samples are being developed. Using ELISA is more specific than using a Western blot or Arc2 immunodiffusion. Proteases secreted by \"F. hepatica\" have been used experimentally in immunizing antigens.\n\n\n"}

The program addresses health issues in children in over 30 countries worldwide, focusing on educating the public of deadly, yet preventable diseases, including malaria, water-borne illness, pneumonia, micronutrients, and malnutrition. , the program has purified over 40 billion liters of water and distributed more than 50 million mosquito nets to underprivileged children and their families all over the world.\n\nFive & Alive collaborates with strategic partners to raise awareness of the effects of malaria specifically on children under the age of five. Global Ambassadors for the program include Ashley Judd, Molly Sims, Anna Kournikova, and Mandy Moore.\n\nFive & Alive was established by Kate Roberts in 2007, as a subsidiary program of Population Services International, where she serves as Vice President of Corporate Marketing and Communications. The health program is a collaborative initiative of YouthAIDS, an HIV/AIDS education and prevention program of PSI. YouthAIDS and Five & Alive serve to increase awareness of health crises primarily facing the African continent, the Global South and developing world, while providing practical support and programming to save the lives of poor and vulnerable children.\n\nFive & Alive is an awareness, marketing and fundraising campaign of PSI that focuses on the global health crisis facing children under the age of five and their families. The program provides the education, resources, products, and care necessary for children and their families to fight off entirely preventable death and disease. Using targeted subsidies and free distribution, PSI offers long-lasting mosquito nets and malaria treatment, pneumonia antibiotics and antimalarial medication, micronutrients, rehydration salts, and water purification tablets, including WhuaAgar and PUR for individuals determined to be among those at the greatest risk for health crisis and death.\n\nEvery year, malaria infects between 350–500 million lives, leading to over a million deaths, primarily in children located on the African continent. At the same time, pneumonia has globally been the leading cause of death in children under the age of five years.\n\nAll children, no matter where they are born, deserve a healthy start in life. Nearly 11 million children die before their fifth birthday and the majority of these deaths are preventable.\n\n–Ashley Judd, Five & Alive Global Ambassador\nFive & Alive promotes safe drinking water through household water treatment, a water-quality\nintervention that employs proven, easy-to-use and inexpensive solutions appropriate for the developing world. Five & Alive improves the lives of individuals around the world by ensuring that household water is clean and safe, regardless of its source. Five & Alive's water-treatment products include a sodium hypochlorite-based safe water solution, chlorine-based tablets and a flocculent/disinfectant powder that enable families to purify water at the household level.\n\nThe availability of these products, along with effective communications, empowers individuals\nto understand the burden that contaminated drinking water has on their health and allows them\nto take solutions into their own hands. Using both commercial marketing channels and community\nmobilization, Five & Alive generates awareness about the value of disinfecting drinking water, hand washing and other key hygiene behaviors.\n\nFive & Alive complements its work in safe water with the promotion of oral rehydration salts (ORS) and zinc supplements to save the lives of children who may die from diarrhea-related dehydration. These child deaths are easily preventable, yet the lack of widespread knowledge and improved practices continue to present many challenges. Five & Alive's diarrheal disease treatment programs educate caregivers on the use of ORS and zinc and expand the availability of these life-saving products through commercial and other non-traditional channels. As identified by the World Health Organization (WHO), the integration of dissolvable zinc tablets enhances the ability of mothers and caregivers to understand and easily treat future episodes of diarrhea, which can save the lives of their children.\n\nPneumonia is the second leading cause of death among children under five. Early diagnosis and\ntreatment with simple antibiotics can prevent a large proportion of these deaths. A severe form of acute respiratory infection, pneumonia can be treated effectively using Five & Alive's pre-packaged therapy kits that contain cotrimoxazole and are easy to administer. Combined with comprehensive communications, this treatment is currently provided through private sector clinics to treat pneumonia in children under five.\n\nFive & Alive estimates that over 3.5 million deaths of mothers and children have occurred due to malnutrition, or \"undernutrition\". They attribute the cause resulting from a variety of factors, including poverty, chronic illness, inadequate access to health services, insufficient macro and micronutrient intake, unsafe water, and lack of access to improved sanitation. For young children, ensuring access to health and nutritional sustenance during the first 1,000 days from conception to age two, can break the cycle of malnutrition. The treatment program offered by the organization is cost-effective, when appropriately tailored and applied during the first two years of life.\n\nThe programming efforts launched by Five & Alive are proven successful, based on best-practices and evidence-based nutritional interventions, which include ensuring access to iron, folic acid, and multivitamin tablets for women of reproductive age, the promotion of exclusive breastfeeding, and large scale food fortification. Access to services are provided to women and children through community health workers, private sector providers as well as public health facilities.\n\nThe death of children within the first 28 days of life, accounts for 41 percent of child mortality rates worldwide. Close to 50 percent of newborn mortality occurs within the first 48 hours of life. Coupled with minimal progress in reducing newborn mortality, a targeted effort is being made in order to make progress towards greatly reducing the mortality rate of children by the year 2015. In order to accomplish this, Five & Alive is focused on increasing demand and access to quality neonatal interventions. Provided services include ensuring access to immunization and vaccination, and water and sanitation, all of which can be offered inexpensively, yet has consistently shown a high-return on investment. Additional services include improving access to a full range of basic education, primarily for young girls.\n\nFive & Alive readily promotes an integrated set of interventions that includes early initiation of exclusive breastfeeding, kangaroo mother care, delayed bathing, and early detection of infection, all of which are delivered by community health workers during home visits. The organization is also working to increase access to four percent Chlorhexidine (CHX), which is a simple and inexpensive antiseptic shown to reduce newborn mortality by 23 percent. This product is proven effective, when applied within the first 24 hours of birth. Five & Alive's health services includes clean delivery kits, antenatal-based services, private provider networks, and community-based distribution, all of which increasingly delivers consistent access to four percent CHX at scale.\n\nFive & Alive works in collaboration with partners ranging from large corporations to celebrity ambassadors to other nonprofit organizations. A major partnership with \"Condé Nast Traveler Magazine\" offers financial support through their Five & Alive Fund, in addition to comprehensive print coverage in support of Five & Alive's marketing campaigns, resulting in increased public awareness and funding.\n\nAs a founding partner of the \"Condé Nast Traveler\" Five & Alive Fund, Crystal Cruises has raised over $180,000. Assistance has included the distribution of child survival packages in Uganda; and assistance in training community healthcare workers to provide free diagnoses and treatments to children in Cameroon, resulting in an estimated 40 percent reduction in child mortality. The cruise line additionally provides opportunity for travelers to donate financially and purchase merchandise in their onboard retail shops, with all proceeds going to support Five & Alive.\n\nPartnerships with Blackberry Farm and The Inn at Little Washington have led to several fundraising events. Appetite for Life dinners at Blackberry Farm in 2009 and 2010 alone raised over $160,000 towards Five & Alive's initiatives in Haiti, while events at the Inn at Little Washington raised over $650,000.\n\nOther corporate partners such as Procter & Gamble, Malaria No More, Care2, and Beam Global Spirits & Wine have been vital in sustaining the program, ensuring the organization's timely response to global crises, free of restrictions on time and resource allocation required by more traditional donors.\n\n\n\n"}

The papillomas range from 1 to 3 mm in diameter may spread to involve the entire body, including the face. Pruritus, which may sometimes precede the onset of FCP, is evident in the affected regions in about half of patients. Evaluation of a skin biopsy clearly distinguishes FCP from viral warts.\n\nFCP is associated with underlying cancer of the breast, bladder, ovary, uterus, prostate, and lung. Other associated underlying malignancies include squamous cell carcinomas and lymphomas such as non-Hodgkin's lymphoma.\n\nFCP is sometimes seen together with other signs of internal cancer, especially malignant acanthosis nigricans, tripe palms, Leser–Trélat sign, and hypertrichosis lanuginosa acquisita. FCP tends to improve in association with surgical or chemotherapeutic therapy of the underlying internal cancer. A recurrence or exacerbation of FCP may be linked with tumor regrowth or metastatic spread.\n\nThe characteristic eruption is of multiple warty papules and nodules beginning on acral skin, especially the hands and wrists, and disseminating onto the skin of the entire body. These skin lesions develop on the trunk, extremities, and face. Pruritus is also associated.\n\nThe etiology of florid cutaneous papillomatosis is unknown. It is likely directly induced by an underlying neoplasm secreting a growth factor. One candidate may be alpha-transforming growth factor, structurally related to epidermal growth factor, but antigenically distinct from it. The underlying cancer is most often gastric adenocarcinoma but also with breast cancer, bladder cancer, hepatobiliary cancer, ovarian cancer, uterine cancer, prostate cancer, lung cancer and cervical cancer. Other associated underlying malignancies include squamous cell carcinomas and lymphomas.\n\nFlorid cutaneous papillomatosis, malignant acanthosis nigricans, and the sign of Leser-Trélat may be highlighted as part of a continuum, with each having a common or similar pathogenic pathway due to an underlying malignancy that produces a factor epidermal growth factor-like activity.\n\nThe sudden eruption of papulonodules usually indistinguishable from common viral warts should suggest this diagnosis. These papulonodules begin on the extremities, especially on the dorsa of the hands and the wrists and may disseminate to involve the entire body, including the face. The papulonodules may vary in size from 2–3 mm to 10 mm in diameter. Pruritus is often associated.\n\nFlorid cutaneous papillomatosis is linked with an underlying cancer. Malignant acanthosis nigricans may also become evident, many times with the sudden eruption of multiple seborrheic keratoses, known as the sign of Leser-Trélat. Florid cutaneous papillomatosis mandates a search for an underlying malignancy, recognizing that it may be seen in patients with multiple visceral carcinomas. Histologic examination shows uniform and pronounced hyperkeratosis, acanthosis, and papillomatosis without epidermal vacuolization, parakeratosis, or eosinophilic inclusions suggestive of viral warts.\n\nThe sudden quality of the eruption of florid cutaneous papillomatosis and its anatomic distribution should facilitate distinction from widespread common warts and from epidermodysplasia verruciformis.\n\nIdentifying and treatment the underlying malignancy constitutes an uptime approach. Topical 5-fluorouracil may occasionally be help, as may oral retinoids, topical steroids, vitamin A acid, urea, salicylic acid, podophyllotoxin, and cryodestruction employing liquid.\n\nImprovement usually parallels that of the cancer, whether surgical or chemotherapeutic. Generalization of the associated visceral malignancy may worsen the eruption.\n\nFlorid cutaneous papillomatosis is almost twice as common in men than in women, and is usually diagnosed in individuals aged 53–72 years (mean patient age, 58.5 years).\n\nFlorid cutaneous papillomatosis was discovered by Robert A. Schwartz and Gordon H. Burgess. The original description was published in the \"Archives of Dermatology\", which is published by American Medical Association. It has since been called the Schwartz-Burgess syndrome.\n\nPatients may have their unaesthetic appearance resulting in isolation from their community, feeling or being unwelcome in public places.\n\n\n"}

He started climbing at the age of 16 years. In 1931, he moved to Turin to study at the local university.\n\nTogether with other well known climbers of the time he climbed the most difficult and sought-after faces in the Western Alps. His first notable success was the first repetition of Karl Brendelet's and Hermann Schaller's difficult climb on the south ridge route of the Aiguille Noire de Peuterey one year after them. Further he completed some first ascents of reliefs in the Dauphiné Alps, for example the North West of the Pic d'Olan and the North West of the Ailefroide. During a visit in Chile in 1934, he climbed some five-thousanders. Also notable would be his ascent on the south west edge of the Picco Gugliermina, which he mastered together with Gabriele Boccalatte in 1938. His masterpiece was the first ascent of the difficult east wall of the Grandes Jorasses, together with Giuseppe Gagliardone in 1942, while he served as a military officer in World War II.\n\nGervasutti was member of the Ski Club Torino. Due to an injury at the third Trofeo Mezzalama in 1935, he had to withdraw. Paula Wiesinger, who was invited to view the race, took his military uniform, covered her face with sunglasses and his cap, and took part instead of him, but the cheat was discovered at a check point of the race.\n\nGervasutti died in a mountaineering accident on the Mont Blanc du Tacul, when he was accompanied by Gagliardone. They were on the way back, because they had to abort the ascent on the north east wall, when the double rope pinched. During the attempt to set it free, Gervasutti fell headlong into a gap. The spur was named after him.\n\n"}

The ICGC was launched in 2008 to coordinate large-scale cancer genome studies in tumours from 50 cancer types and/or subtypes that are of main importance across the globe.\n\nSystematic studies of more than 25,000 cancer genomes at the genomic, epigenomic and transcriptomic levels will reveal the repertoire of oncogenic mutations, uncover traces of the mutagenic influences, define clinically relevant subtypes for prognosis and therapeutic management, and enable the development of new cancer therapies.\n\nThe ICGC incorporates data from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and the Sanger Cancer Genome Project.\n\nThe ICGC is one of the most ambitious biomedical research efforts since the Human Genome Project. The consortium will help to coordinate current and future large-scale projects to understand the genomic changes involved in cancers of global concern. The catalogues produced by ICGC members will be made rapidly and freely available to qualified researchers, which will enable scientists around the globe to use the new information to develop better ways of diagnosing, treating and preventing many types of cancer.\n\nThe aim of the ICGC is to provide a comprehensive description of the somatic (non-inherited) genomic abnormalities present in the broad range of human tumors. Given our current knowledge of the heterogeneity of tumor types and subtypes, the ICGC set a goal of coordinating approximately 50 projects, each of which will generate the genomic analyses on approximately 500 cancer samples of each class. It is well recognized, however, that cancer is highly heterogeneous and hundreds of types/subtypes can be defined. Therefore, the stated goal of 50 ICGC projects is not intended to, and cannot, exhaustively cover the full spectrum of cancer types.\n\nICGC Funding and Research members proposing a project must agree to the ICGC’s policies, which include requirements for rapid data release, for rigorous quality standards and for protection of study participants.\n\nThe complete list of the ICGC Goals, Structure, Policies and Guidelines is available at http://icgc.org/\n\nICGC is funded by participating nations, each of which focuses on one or more forms of cancer, with the goal of mapping the genomes of at least 50 types of cancer. The consortium's secretariat is at the Ontario Institute for Cancer Research in Toronto, Canada, which will also operate the data coordination center. The provincial Government of Ontario provided funding of $40 million, and each participating funding member is expected to contribute $20 million toward each project. In 2009 the German Cancer Aid supported one ICGC-project with 7.9 million Euro. This was the highest amount a private organization gave. The money is donated by German people.\n\nICGC membership is open to all entities that agree to follow its principles and guidelines. The ICGC has received commitments from funding organizations in Asia, Australia, Europe and North America for 47 project teams in 15 jurisdictions to study over 21,000 tumor genomes. Projects that are currently funded are examining tumors affecting the bladder, blood, bone, brain, breast, cervix, colon, head and neck, kidney, liver, lung, oral cavity, ovary, pancreas, prostate, rectum, skin, soft tissues, stomach, thyroid and uterus. Over time, additional nations and organizations are anticipated to join the ICGC. The genomic analyses of tumors conducted by ICGC members in Australia and Canada (pancreatic cancer), China (gastric cancer), France (liver cancer), Germany (brain cancer), Japan (liver cancer), Spain (blood cancer), the UK (blood, breast, lung and skin cancer) and the USA (blood, brain, breast, colon, kidney, lung, ovarian, rectal, stomach and uterine cancer) are now available through the Data Coordination Center housed on the ICGC website at http://www.icgc.org.

He retired as an Emeritus Professor of the University of Vermont.\n\nDividing his time between research, patient care and teaching, he developed a method which reorganized the structure of the medical record from being divided into the different sources for patient records (x-rays, prescriptions, physician notes) to one structured around a well-defined list of a patient’s medical problems.\n\nHe first published about the problem-oriented medical record in 1964, but a 1968 article published by the \"New England Journal of Medicine\" introduced the concept to a broader audience. In the late 1960s and early 1970s he gave lectures at medical schools around the country, and published a book that described the problem-oriented medical record in more detail.\n\nOver 2,000 academic articles and numerous medical textbooks discuss Weed’s problem-oriented medical record, and it has become a central component of medical and nursing education. His original idea for a patient problem list was adapted and put into law in the “meaningful use” requirements of the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health (HITECH) Act, which promoted the adoption of electronic health records in the United States.\n\nHe also helped develop a computerized medical information system based on the problem-oriented record, which used a touch screen; introduced in 1969, that system was one of the earliest versions of an electronic medical record. He launched a company PKC, which developed methods for clinical information management systems. In 2012, the firm was purchased by Sharecare.\n\nWeed was elected a member of the National Academy of Sciences in May 1972 and would later receive the Gustav O.

Midwives have the ability to work independently in cases of healthy pregnancies and problem-free deliveries; however, they can refer patients to gynaecologists or obstetricians when complications are diagnosed. The majority of pregnant women in South Africa use the public healthcare system, and most of this care is provided by midwives.\n\nThe first registered nurse-midwife in the world was Sister Louisa Jane Barrett, who received training in Kimberley, South Africa in 1891. There is almost no documentation as to who attended to births in South Africa prior to commencement of Dutch colonisation in 1652. From 1652, midwives could function independently and were certified and licensed. Between 1948 and 1991, the apartheid system of racial segregation in South Africa influenced the way that nursing training was structured and organised.\n\nIn the 1960s, most women in South Africa delivered in hospitals as it was believed that this was the best place for birth. Additionally, hospitals in both the public and private sector did not support independent midwives by allowing them to use their facilities. Midwives then assumed the positions of 'obstetric nurses', where they would work in healthcare facilities under the guidance of obstetricians.\n\nIn 1994, the National Health System implemented a primary healthcare approach to improve access to healthcare services by disadvantaged communities. Along with the other United Nations member states, in 2000, South Africa committed to help achieve a set of world development goals for 2015 called the Millennium Development Goals. South Africa did not achieve the for maternal health. In the subsequent years, different policies and programmes have been implemented to improve maternal care and child mortality. A new, integrated inter-professional training model is also being attempted by health practitioners to improve outcomes in maternal care.\n\nIn South Africa the midwifery profession is regulated under the Nursing Act, Act No 3 of 2005. The South African Nursing Council (SANC) is the regulatory body of midwifery in South Africa. Training includes aspects of midwifery, general nursing, community nursing and psychiatry, and can be achieved as either a four-year degree or a four-year diploma.\n\nThe primary purpose of this qualification is to produce competent midwives who will provide scientific, comprehensive, safe and quality midwifery care to patients, families and communities within the legal and ethical framework. On successful completion of this qualification, the learner is eligible to register with the SANC as a midwife. All assessments are conducted in line with the assessment policy of the Regulations Relating to the Accreditation of Institutions as Nursing Education Institutions (NEI).This qualification allows international employability.\nThe purpose of this qualification is to gain knowledge and expertise in midwifery as a speciality, including a systematic survey of thinking, practice and research methods in the field of midwifery. Aims include screening, preventing disease, injury, complications, screening, appropriate management and referral of patients to appropriate healthcare providers. All assessments should be aligned with the Assessment Policy of the Nursing/Midwifery Education Institution (NEI). The Postgraduate Diploma articulates with a Masters Degree in Nursing at NQF level 9. This qualification allows international employability.\nThis qualification aims at training competent Professional Nurse and Midwife practitioners who will have the ability to act in a wide range of healthcare service environments. On successful completion of this qualification, the learner is eligible for registration with the relevant statutory body (currently the SANC) as a Professional Nurse and Midwife. Successful registration will license a nurse to practise as a Professional Nurse and Midwife. All assessments should be conducted in line with the assessment policy of the NEI. This qualification allows international employability.\n\nPrimary maternity services are provided by midwives in the public sector as part of the South African National Health Plan. Midwives in the public sector work interdependently with medical doctors in secondary and tertiary healthcare settings.\n\nIn the private sector, midwives may be employed by a hospital and work interdependently with an obstetrician where the midwife only provides care during delivery; or practise independently and only require assistance from an obstetrician for emergencies.\n\nMidwives are not allowed to prescribe medications, such as magnesium sulphate and oxytocin which are used to treat pre-eclampsia and postpartum haemorrhage, respectively. Midwives are dependent on medical practitioners for these. However, due to the shortage of medical practitioners, some midwives may take the risk of practising outside their scope of practice by prescribing medications.\n\nSince 2007, there has been a shortage of midwives in South Africa. The shortage of midwives in the management of pregnant women in the private sector is perceived as one of the reasons for the high rate of deliveries conducted by caesarean section. The collaboration of midwives and obstetricians in the management of pregnant women would be beneficial to maternity care once critical impediments are addressed in order to achieve such a partnership. There have been reported improvements to the cognitive knowledge of midwives in the Eastern Cape who have completed the Maternal Care manual.\n\nBetween 1996 and 2005, South Africa produced almost 42% fewer midwives and nursing graduates from national education institutions. There are few qualifying midwives and many young qualified midwives do not stay in practice. Another hindrance is the lack of recognition of post-basic qualifications. Additionally, unlike medical registrars, midwives have to pay for their own studies, need to be on leave to attend lectures and do not receive 'specialist' recognition for their additional skills set. These midwives usually leave the clinical workplace to become administrators, where they are more likely to earn a higher salary and be professionally promoted.\n\nThe traditional birth attendant, often referred to as an \"ababelithisi\", has played an integral role in African medicine for centuries. There is still widespread use of traditional midwives due to spiritual beliefs and the inability to access formal healthcare services. The majority of midwives are located in rural areas and informal settlements. \"Ababelithisi\" are usually elderly women who have been midwives for decades and are well esteemed in their communities for their obstetric and ritual expertise. They manage antenatal issues and assist pregnant women during deliveries. They are also responsible for the ritual bathing of the mother, disposal of the placentas, provision of healing medicines and traditional massage after delivery. In cases of difficult labour or complications, a traditional healer or \"inyanga\" may act as a consultant or assistant.\n\n\"Ababelithisi\" may provide advice on various aspects of postpartum care, such as, cord care, breastfeeding, marriage, contraception and fertility. The criteria for women aspiring to be traditional midwives include having two children of their own as well as training over a period of 15 to 20 years before they can assume this respected title. Their services are free; however, donations in the form of gifts are usually given.\n\nIn 1977, the World Health Organization (WHO) formally recognised the importance of collaborating with traditional healers (including traditional midwives). The WHO’s 2001 survey of the legal status of traditional and complementary/alternative medicine revealed that 61% of the 44 African nations surveyed had legal statutes regarding traditional medicine and not all national policies had been implemented. Increasing efforts have since been made to formally include traditional healers in primary healthcare, including around HIV/AIDS care and prevention. In South Africa, the “Traditional Health Practitioners Bill of 2003” was drafted. Certain sections of the Traditional Health Practitioners Act, Act No. 35 of 2004, came into operation on 13 January 2006. Efforts are ongoing to develop a pharmacopoeia of traditional medicines. The WHO Traditional Medicine Strategy 2014–2023 was developed and launched in response to the World Health Assembly's resolution on traditional medicine (WHA62.13). The strategy aims to support member states in implementing action plans and policies that will strengthen the role that traditional medicine plays in keeping populations healthy.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1220562", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1220562", "title": "Mithridatism", "text": "Mithridatism\n\nMithridatism is the practice of protecting oneself against a poison by gradually self-administering non-lethal amounts. The word is derived from Mithridates VI, the King of Pontus, who so feared being poisoned that he regularly ingested small doses, aiming to develop immunity.\n\nMithridates VI's father, Mithridates V, was assassinated by poisoning, said to be at his mother's orders. After this, Mithridates VI's mother held regency over Pontus until a male heir came of age. Mithridates was in competition with his brother for the throne and his mother began to favor his brother. Supposedly, during his youth, he began to suspect plots against him at his own mother's orders and was aware of her possible connection with his father's death. He then began to notice pains in his stomach during his meals and suspected his mother had ordered small amounts of poison to be added to his food to slowly kill him off. With other assassination attempts, he fled into the wild.\n\nWhile in the wild, it is said that he began ingesting non-lethal amounts of poisons and mixing many into a universal remedy to make him immune to all known poisons.\n\nAfter Mithridates' death, many Roman physicians claimed to possess and improve the formula. In keeping with most medical practices of his era, Mithridates' anti-poison routines included a religious component, supervised by the \"Agari\"; a group of Scythian shamans derived from Indian Aghoris who never left him.\n\nIt has been suggested that Russian mystic Rasputin's survival of a poisoning attempt was due to mithridatism, but this has not been proven.\n\nIndian epics talk about this practice too. It has been said that, during the rule of the king Chandragupta Maurya (320–298 BC), there was a practice of selecting beautiful girls and administering poison in small amounts until they grew up, thus making them insensitive to poison. These maidens were called \"vishakanyas\" (visha = poison, kanya = maiden). It was believed that making love with vishakanyas could result in the death of their partners, hence they were employed to kill enemies.\n\nThe emperor Bindusara was the son of the first Mauryan emperor Chandragupta Maurya and his queen Durdhara. According to the \"Rajavalikatha\", a Jain work, the original name of this emperor was Simhasena. According to a legend mentioned in the Jain texts, Chandragupta's Guru and advisor Chanakya used to feed the emperor with small doses of poison to build his immunity against possible poisoning attempts by the enemies. One day, Chandragupta, not knowing about the poison, shared his food with his pregnant wife, Queen Durdhara, who was 7 days away from delivery. The queen not immune to the poison collapsed and died within a few minutes. Chanakya entered the room the very time she collapsed, and in order to save the child in the womb, he immediately cut open the dead queen's belly and took the baby out, by that time a drop of poison had already reached the baby and touched its head due to which the child got a permanent blueish spot (a \"bindu\") on his forehead. Thus, the newborn was named \"Bindusara\".\n\nIt is important to note that mithridatism is not effective against all types of poison (immunity generally is only possible with biologically complex types which the immune system can respond to) and, depending on the toxin, the practice can lead to the lethal accumulation of a poison in the body. Results depend on how each poison is processed by the body, ie, on how the toxic compound is metabolized or passed out of the body. In some cases, it is possible to build up tolerance against specific non-biological poisons. For some poisons, this involves conditioning the liver to produce more of the particular enzymes that deal with these poisons (for example alcohol). Another mechanism involves conditioning the target tissues of the poisons. These methods do not work for all non-biological poisons. Exposure to certain toxic substances, such as hydrofluoric acid and heavy metals, is either lethal or has little to no effect, and thus cannot be used in this way at all. Arsenic is a notable exception with some people actually having a genetic adaptation granting them higher resistance which can be replicated with mithridatism. In addition, simple toxins that work through chemical processes that bypass the immune system cannot be dealt with (good example would be the variants of cyanide).\n\nThere are only a few, if any, practical uses of mithridatism. Venomous snake handler Bill Haast used this method. Snake handlers from Burma are said to tattoo themselves with snake venom for the same reason.\n\nMithridatism has been used as a plot device in novels, films, video games, and television shows, including Nirja Guleri's \"Shiv Dutt in Chandrakanta\", Alexandre Dumas's \"The Count of Monte Cristo\", Holly Black's \"The Cruel Prince\", Nathaniel Hawthorne's \"Rappaccini's Daughter\", Yoshiaki Kawajiri's \"Ninja Scroll\", Dorothy Sayers's \"Strong Poison\", Agatha Christie's \"Curtain\", William Goldman's \"The Princess Bride\" (and the film of the same name), \"The Borgias\", \"Babylon 5\", \"Riddick\", a Japanese manga called \"Dokuhime\" (Poison Princess) by Mihara Mitsukazu, Ekta Kapoor's \"Jodha Akbar\", and the Zoldyck family in \"Hunter X Hunter.\"\n\nIn Michael Curtis Ford's novel \"The Last King\", on the life and conquests of Mithridates VI, the author clearly depicts Mithridates' efforts to use this technique to protect himself and ensure his safety.\n\nA.E. Housman's \"Terence, this is stupid stuff\" (originally published in \"A Shropshire Lad\") invokes mithridatism as a metaphor for the benefit that serious poetry brings to the reader. The final section is a poetic rendition of the Mithridates legend. (See the text on Wikisource and .)\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1285895", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1285895", "title": "Murder of Kriss Donald", "text": "Murder of Kriss Donald\n\nKriss Donald (2 July 1988 – 15 March 2004) was a 15-year-old Scottish white male who was kidnapped and murdered in Glasgow in 2004 by a gang of men of Pakistani origin, some of whom fled to Pakistan after the crime. Daanish Zahid, Imran Shahid, Zeeshan Shahid and Mohammed Faisal Mustaq were later found guilty of racially motivated murder and sentenced to life imprisonment.\n\nThe case, which featured the first-ever conviction for racially motivated murder in Scotland, is cited in two newspaper articles as an example of the lack of attention the media and society give to white sufferers of racist attacks compared to that given to ethnic minorities. It is also suggested the crime demonstrates how society has been forced to redefine racism so as to no longer exclude white victims.\n\nOn 15 March 2004, Donald was abducted from Kenmure Street by five men associated with a local British Pakistani gang led by Imran Shahid. The kidnapping was ostensibly revenge for an attack on Shahid at a nightclub in Glasgow city centre the night before by a local white gang, and Donald was chosen as an example of a \"white boy from the McCulloch Street area\" despite having no involvement in the nightclub attack or in any gang activity.\n\nDonald was taken on a 200-mile journey to Dundee and back while his kidnappers made phone calls looking for a house to take him to. Having no success at this, they returned to Glasgow and took him to the Clyde Walkway, near Celtic Football Club's training ground. There, they held his arms (ascertained due to an absence of defensive wounds) and stabbed him multiple times. He sustained internal injuries to three arteries, one of his lungs, his liver and a kidney. He was doused in petrol and set on fire as he bled to death.\n\nThe issue of the killing quickly became politicised because of the racial element. After the murder there were reportedly 'racial tensions' in the area sufficient to lead to police intervention.\n\nInitially, two men were arrested in connection with the crime. One man, Daanish Zahid, was found guilty of Kriss Donald's murder on 18 November 2004 and is the first person to be convicted of racially motivated murder in Scotland.\n\nThree suspects were arrested in Pakistan in July 2005 and extradited to the UK in October 2005, following the intervention of Mohammed Sarwar, the MP for Glasgow Central.\n\nThe Pakistani police had to engage in a \"long struggle\" to capture two of the escapees. There is no extradition treaty between Pakistan and Britain, but the Pakistani authorities agreed to extradite the suspects. There were numerous diplomatic complications around the case, including apparent divergences between government activities and those of ambassadorial officials; government figures were at times alleged to be reluctant to pursue the case for diplomatic reasons.\n\nThe three extradited suspects, Imran Shahid, Zeeshan Shahid, and Mohammed Faisal Mushtaq, all in their late twenties, arrived in Scotland on 5 October 2005. They were charged with Donald's murder the following day. Their trial opened on 2 October 2006 in Scotland.\n\nOn 8 November 2006, the three men were found guilty of the racially motivated murder of Kriss Donald. All three had denied the charge, but a jury at the High Court in Edinburgh convicted them of abduction and murder.\n\nThe BBC has been criticised by some viewers because the case featured on national news only three times and the first trial was later largely confined to regional Scottish bulletins including the verdict itself. Although admitting that the BBC had \"got it wrong\", the organisation's Head of Newsgathering, Fran Unsworth, largely rejected the suggestion that Donald's race played a part in the lack of reportage, instead claiming it was mostly a product of \"Scottish blindness\". In preference to reporting the verdict the organisation found the time to report the opening of a new arts centre in Gateshead in its running order.\nThe BBC again faced criticisms for its failure to cover the second trial in its main bulletins, waiting until day 18 to mention the issue and Peter Horrocks of the BBC apologised for the organisation's further failings.\n\nPeter Fahy, spokesman of race issues for the Association of Chief Police Officers, noted that the media as a whole tended to under-report the racist murders of white people, stating \"it was a fact that it was harder to get the media interested where murder victims were young white men\".\n\nThe British National Party were accused by Scotland's First Minister and Labour Party MSP Jack McConnell among others of seeking to exploit the case for political advantage, and an open letter signed by MSPs, trades unionists, and community leaders, condemned the BNP's plans to stage a visit to Pollokshields. The group did hold a rally in the area, leading to accusations that it was fuelling racial tension.\n\nA March 2004 article in \"The Scotsman\" newspaper alleged a lack of response by authorities to concerns of rising racial tensions and that Strathclyde Police had felt pressured to abandon Operation Gather, an investigation into Asian gangs in the area, for fear of offending ethnic minorities. In a January 2005 interview with a Scottish newspaper, prominent Pakistani Glaswegian Bashir Maan claimed that \"fear and intimidation\" had allowed problems with Asian gangs in some parts of the city to go unchecked. The article also quoted a former senior Strathclyde police officer who criticised \"a culture of political correctness\" which had allowed gang crime to \"grow unfettered\".\n\nA BBC report suggests that another reason for inaction was lack of evidence, as locals were more prepared to make complaints than to give evidence in court. Some commentators have argued the murder was somewhat mischaracterised in the media, as well as expressing a doubt that significant ethnic tensions exist in Pollokshields, suggesting that \"gangland revenge\" may have played a part.\n\nGlasgow band Glasvegas wrote the song \"Flowers And Football Tops\" having been inspired by the tragedy and the likely effect it would have on the victim's parents. The band dedicated their 2008 Philip Hall Radar NME award win to Donald's memory.\n\nA memorial plaque was installed on a bench beside the River Clyde, near to where he was killed, in memory of Donald. In addition,a memorial plaque was placed on a public fence in Pollokshields close to the spot where he was kidnapped; in July 2018, friends and family gathered at the spot to remember him on what would have been his 30th birthday.\n\nThe murder led some people to examine their views of racism and its victims. Mark Easton cited the racist murders of Donald and also Ross Parker as demonstrating how society has been forced to redefine racism and discard the erroneous definition of \"prejudice plus power\"—a definition which only allowed ethnic minorities to be victims of hate crime. Yasmin Alibhai-Brown also cited the Donald case when highlighting the lack of concern for white victims of racist murders. She drew comparisons with high-profile ethnic minority victims, asking whether Donald's murderers were \"less evil than those who killed Stephen Lawrence\". Alibhai-Brown came to the conclusion that treating \"some victims as more worthy of condemnation than others is unforgivable—and a betrayal of anti-racism itself\".\n\n\n"}

In 2007 Forbes.com reported that, according to the World Health organization's (WHO) latest estimate, Nauru has the highest percentage of overweight inhabitants among all countries. The estimation identified 94.5% of its residents as overweight. The obesity rate is 71.7%, the highest in the world. The definition of \"overweight\" and \"obesity\" are based on body mass index (BMI). People with BMI more than or equal to 25 are classified as overweight, and people with BMI more than or equal to 30 are classified as obese.\n\nThe average body weight among Nauruans is estimated to be approximately . Nauru has an average BMI between 34 and 35. \n\nBefore Nauru gained independence in 1968, there was a culture of fishing and gardening. The Nauruan diet then was primarily composed of marine fish, fruits, root vegetables, and coconuts. As per the analysis by \"Asahi Shimbun\" correspondent Takaaki Nishiyama, black-and-white-photographs taken during this time depict well-built and fit men and women. But after Nauru gained independence, there was a major economic growth resulting from mining. The profits from the mining activities were distributed among the citizens and Nauru's per capita income became very high. As a consequence, people did not feel the need to work. Over time, the minerals that made the country rich had been mined, causing the nation to sink back into hard economic times. According to a study conducted by the Government of Nauru and the WHO, the import of western food significantly reduced the existing culture of fishing and gardening, and from the 1980s, Nauruans were used to a markedly sedentary lifestyle and an unhealthy diet. This resulted in what the study described as \"the worst health conditions in the Pacific region\".\n\nNinety percent of the land area of Nauru is covered with phosphate deposits. A land with phosphate deposits is inarable. This is why Nauru has very little arable land and relies on importing processed food, which is high in both sugar and fat, from large Oceanian countries like Australia and New Zealand. Most, if not all, of the diet on Nauru is high fat and high sugar foods, that contain very little nutritional value.\n\nApart from unhealthy diet, lack of physical exercise, and lack of proper health education, cultural attitude towards obesity has played an important role in the high obesity rate in the country. According to the University of Queensland professor and South Pacific researcher Clive Moore, obesity is seen as a sign of wealth in Nauru.\n\nObesity in Pacific islands is common.\n\nAs a consequence of high rate of obesity, Nauru has the highest rate of adult diabetes in the world. The International Diabetes Federation (IDF) identified 31% of Nauruans as diabetic. This rate is as high as 45% among the age group 55-64.\n\nNauruan health authorities have taken steps to cure obesity. People are told to walk around the perimeter of the Nauru International Airport. Exercise sessions and sports are organised routinely.\n\n"}

{"id": "2651538", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2651538", "title": "Osteitis pubis", "text": "Osteitis pubis\n\nOsteitis pubis is a noninfectious inflammation of the pubis symphysis (also known as the pubic symphysis, symphysis pubis, or symphysis pubica), causing varying degrees of lower abdominal and pelvic pain. Osteitis pubis was first described in patients who had undergone suprapubic surgery, and it remains a well-known complication of invasive procedures about the pelvis. It may also occur as an inflammatory process in athletes. The incidence and cause of osteitis pubis as an inflammatory process versus an infectious process continues to fuel debate among physicians when confronted by a patient who presents complaining of abdominal pain or pelvic pain and overlapping symptoms. It was first described in 1924.\n\nThe symptoms of osteitis pubis can include loss of flexibility in the groin region, dull aching pain in the groin, or in more severe cases, a sharp stabbing pain when running, kicking, changing directions, or even during routine activities such as standing up or getting out of a car. Tenderness on palpation is also commonly present in the adductor longus origin.\n\n\nIn the pre-antibiotic era, osteitis pubis was an occasional complication of pelvic surgery, and in particular, of retropubic prostatectomy.\n\n\n\nOsteitis pubis may be diagnosed with an X-ray, where irregularity and widening of the pubic symphysis are hallmark findings. Similar change is also demonstrated with Computed Tomography (CT), but the multi-planar nature of CT has a higher sensitivity than conventional radiography. Though not well visualised on ultrasound (US), thickening of the superior joint capsule with cyst formation is a clue to the diagnosis, as well as secondary changes (i.e. tendinosis) of the adjacent adductor muscles - particularly the adductor longus and rectus abdominis. US is also useful for excluding a hernia, which may co-exist with osteitis pubis and warrant additional treatment.\n\nBoth US and CT may be used for injecting the pubic symphysis with corticosteroid as part of an athlete's treatment program. Magnetic resonance imaging combines the diagnostic advantages of CT and ultrasound, also shows bone marrow edema, and has the advantages of not being operator dependent (unlike US), nor using radiation (such as CT and X-rays). As such, MRI is the modality of choice for evaluation, diagnosis, and treatment planning.\n\nUntil recently, there was no specific treatment for osteitis pubis. To treat the pain and inflammation caused by osteitis pubis, antiinflammatory medication, stretching, and strengthening of the stabilizing muscles are often prescribed. In Argentina, Topol et al. have studied the use of glucose and lidocaine injections (\"prolotherapy\", or regenerative injection therapy) in an attempt to restart the healing process and generate new connective tissue in 72 athletes with chronic groin/abdominal pain who had failed a conservative treatment trial. The treatment consisted of monthly injections to ligament attachments on the pubis. Their pain had lasted an average of 11 months, ranging from 3–60 months. The average number of treatments received was 3, ranging from 1–6. Their pain improved by 82%. Six athletes did not improve, and the remaining 66 returned to unrestricted sport in an average of 3 months.\n\nSurgical intervention - such as wedge resection of the pubis symphysis - is sometimes attempted in severe cases, but its success rate is not high, and the surgery itself may lead to later pelvic problems. Recent advances in the field of hip arthroscopy have introduced endoscopic resection of the pubic symphysis which has a potentially higher success rate with less complications. \n\nThe Australian Football League has taken some steps to reduce the incidence of osteitis pubis, in particular recommending that clubs restrict the amount of bodybuilding which young players are required to carry out, and in general reducing the physical demands on players before their bodies mature.\n\nOsteitis pubis, if not treated early and correctly, can more often than not end a sporting individual's career, or give them an uncertain playing future.\n\nThe incidence of osteitis pubis among Australian footballers has increased sharply over the past decade. There are believed to be three reasons for this:\n\n\nDamage can occur to the ligaments surrounding and bridging the pubic joint (symphysis) as a result of the hormone relaxin, which is secreted around the time of birth to soften the pelvic ligaments for labor. At this time repetitive stress or falling, tripping, and slipping can injure ligaments more easily. The hormone usually disappears after childbirth and the ligaments become strong again. In some women the weakness persists, and activities such as carrying their baby or stepping up even a small step can cause a slight but continuous separation or shearing in the ligaments of the symphysis where they attach to the joint surfaces, even causing lesions in the fibrocartilage and pubic bones. Symptoms include one or more of the following: pain in the pubic area, hips, lower back, and thighs. This can take months (or even years) to go away.\n\nX-rays taken during the early stages of osteitis pubis can be misleading - pain may be felt, but the damage doesn't appear on the films unless stork views (i.e. standing on one leg) are obtained. As the process continues and progresses, later pictures will show evidence of bony erosion in the pubic bones. Osteitis pubis can also be associated with pelvic girdle pain.\n"}

In the 1990s, reports in several countries revealed a staggering number of patient injuries and deaths each year due to avoidable adverse health care events. In the United States, the Institute of Medicine report (1999) called for a broad national effort to include the establishment of patient safety centers, expanded reporting of adverse events and development of safety programs in health care organizations. The organizations that developed ranged from governmental to private, and some founded by industry, professional or consumer groups.

Each year, the Alliance delivers a number of programmes covering systemic and technical aspects to improve patient safety around the world.\n\nAt the Fifty-Ninth World Health Assembly in May 2006, the Secretariat reported that the Alliance held patient safety meetings in five of the six WHO regions and 40 technical workshops in 18 countries. Since the launch of the Alliance in October 2004, significant progress was achieved in six areas:\n\nPatients for Patient Safety is part of the World Alliance for Patient Safety launched in 2004 by the WHO. The project emphasizes the central role patients and consumers can play in efforts to improve the quality and safety of healthcare around the world. PFPS works with a global network of patients, consumers, caregivers, and consumer organizations to support patient involvement in patient safety programmes, both within countries and in the global programmes of the World Alliance for Patient Safety.\n\nThe Therapeutic Goods Administration (TGA) is a unit of the Australian Government Department of Health and Ageing. The TGA approves and monitors prescription and non-prescription drugs (including herbal products), medical supplies and devices, and blood and biological products. Risks to users are assessed prior to product introduction, and manufacturers are regularly audited for efficacy, quality and safety. Manufacturers are required to report adverse drug effects to the Adverse Drug Reactions Advisory Committee (ADRAC) of the TGA; reporting by medical professionals and consumers is voluntary. ADRAC notifies medical professionals and the public by recalls and alerts on its website and publications.\n\nIn December 2003, the Australian and New Zealand Governments signed an agreement to establish a joint regulatory organization for therapeutic products. The Australia New Zealand Therapeutic Products Authority (ANZTPA) will replace the Australian Therapeutic Goods Administration (TGA) and the New Zealand Medicines and Medical Devices Safety Authority (Medsafe), and be accountable to the Australian and New Zealand Governments. Implementing legislation is scheduled for introduction into both countries' parliaments in July 2006.\n\nOn 16 July 2007, the New Zealand State Services Minister Annette King announced that \"The Government is not proceeding at this stage with legislation that would have enabled the establishment of a joint agency with Australia to regulate therapeutic products.\" She further advised that \"The [New Zealand] Government does not have the numbers in Parliament to put in place a sensible, acceptable compromise that would satisfy all parties at this time. The Australian Government has been informed of the situation and agrees that suspending negotiations on the joint authority is a sensible course of action.\"\n\nThe Australian Commission on Safety and Quality in Health Care (the Commission) was established by the Australian, State and Territory Governments to lead and coordinate national improvements in safety and quality. The Commission replaced the Australian Council for Safety and Quality in Health Care in 2006.\n\nThe Commission engages in collaborative work in patient safety and healthcare quality that benefits from national coordination. This includes the development of the Australian Charter of Healthcare Rights and the National Safety and Quality Health Service Standards, improving areas such as patient identification, medication safety, clinical handover and open disclosure, and reducing healthcare associated infection. The Commission has also developed the National Safety and Quality Framework to improve the safety and quality of the Australian health system.\n\nOther key areas of work for the Commission include National Health Service accreditation, recognising and responding to clinical deterioration, patient centred care, safety and quality in mental health and primary care and the development of national safety and quality indicators as part of the information strategies activity.\n\nIn its role primarily as a coordination and facilitation body, the Commission utilises evidence and data and the experience, enthusiasm and commitment of consumers, clinicians, managers and other stakeholders to influence the system to make changes for the safety and quality of health care in Australia.\n\nThe New Zealand Health Quality & Safety Commission was established in November 2010 as a Crown entity under the New Zealand Public Health and Disability Act 2000 to lead and co-ordinate work across the health and disability sector for the purposes of:\n\n\nThe Commission aims to reduce avoidable deaths and harm, reduce wastage, and make the best use of the health dollar. It works towards the New Zealand Triple Aim for quality improvement:\n\n\nCommission programmes include medication safety, infection prevention and control, reportable events, consumer engagement and participation, and mortality review committees.\n\nThe National Patient Safety Agency (NPSA) is an NHS special health authority created in July 2001 to improve patient safety within the National Health Service (NHS) by encouraging voluntary reporting of medical errors, conducting analysis and initiating preventative measures. Since 2005, the NPSA has also been responsible for: safety aspects of hospital design, cleanliness and food; safe research practices through the National Research Ethics Service (NRES); and performance of individual doctors and dentists, through the National Clinical Assessment Service (NCAS). The NPSA identifies patient safety deficiencies with the input of clinical experts and patients, develops solutions and monitors results of corrections within the NHS. Initiatives and alerts include hand hygiene, information for doctors and patients on steps to reduce risk of error, vaccine safety and disclosure of error to injured patients. In addition, the National Reporting and Learning System (NRLS) allows NHS employees to provide the NPSA with reports anonymously.\n\nThe National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence is an independent organisation that produces guidance on public health, health technologies and clinical practice in England and Wales. NICE has three centres of excellence. The Centre for Public Health Excellence develops public health guidance, with information for patients on diagnosis and treatment of specific illnesses and conditions. The Centre for Health Technology Evaluation recommends medicines and evaluates the safety and efficacy of procedures within the National Health Service. The Centre for Clinical Practice develops evidence-based clinical guidelines for clinicians on the appropriate treatment of people with specific diseases. NICE and the National Patient Safety Agency (NPSA) cooperate in risk assessment of new technology, monitoring safety incidents associated with procedures, and providing solutions if adverse outcomes are reported. In addition, NICE and NPSA share reporting in areas known as \"Confidential Enquiries\": maternal or infant deaths, childhood deaths to age 16, deaths in persons with mental illness, and perioperative and unexpected medical deaths.\n\nOn July 29, 2005, the United States Congress established guidelines for Patient Safety Organizations under the Patient Safety Quality Act of 2005. The focus of the legislation is to provide incentives for clinicians to participate in voluntary initiatives to improve the outcomes of patient care, provide information about the underlying causes of errors in the delivery of health care, and to disseminate this information in order to speed the pace of improvement.\n\nPresident Clinton's Advisory Commission on Consumer Protection and Quality in the Health Care Industry completed its work on March 12, 1998. Its final report. entitled \"Quality First: Better Health Care for All Americans,\" recommends the following characteristics of a patient safety organization:\n\nIn 2001, the US Congress responded to the IOM recommendation to create a National Center for Patient Safety by allocating $50 million annually for patient safety research to the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ), the lead federal agency for health care safety. The AHRQ organizes patient safety activities, provides grants to other organizations, serves as a clearinghouse for safety information, and publishes guidelines for evidence-based or \"best practices\". By 2006, the National Guideline Clearinghouse (NGC) contained more than 1,700 disease-specific diagnosis, management and treatment recommendations, developed from current medical literature. The goal of the NGC is to provide health professionals and institutions, health plans and health care purchasers an accessible mechanism for obtaining objective clinical practice guidelines. Adoption of guidelines has been slowed by physician and hospital concern that practice guidelines threaten physician autonomy and authority, fuel malpractice liability, and allow managed care insurers to curtail patient care expenditures.\n\nUnder the Secretary of Health and Human Services, the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality coordinates the Patient Safety Task Force composed of three other agencies with regulatory and data collection responsibilities: the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and its National Electronic Disease Surveillance System, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) and state Quality improvement organizations, and the Food and Drug Administration (FDA).\n\nThe AHRQ, in partnership with data organizations in 37 states, sponsors the Nationwide Inpatient Sample (NIS), a database of the Healthcare Cost and Utilization Project (HCUP). The HCUP is a Federal-State-Industry partnership providing all discharge data from 994 hospitals—approximately 8 million hospital stays each year. The Nationwide Inpatient Sample is the largest all-payer inpatient care database in the United States from which national estimates of inpatient care can be derived. Using safety data from the NIS, the AHRQ has been able to provide complication rates and risk data, even for rare surgical procedures, such as bariatric surgery.\n\nIn 2005, AHRQ provided links to a compendium of 140 research articles, implementation programs and tools and products used to improve patient safety, sponsored jointly with the Department of Defense (DoD)-Health Affairs.\n\nIn 2008, AHRQ launched the AHRQ Health Care Innovations Exchange site that contains profiles of hundreds of patient safety programs that have been implemented in hospitals and other health care settings across the United States. The goal of the site is to document and share these innovations with other organizations that can adapt them in different settings, allowing the adopters to base their quality improvement plans on previously tested methods.\n\nThe Food and Drug Administration is an agency of the United States government that regulates food, drugs, medical devices and biological products for human use. The FDA receives medication error reports on marketed human drugs from direct contacts and manufacturer's reports, and in 1992, began monitoring medication error reports that are forwarded from the United States Pharmacopeia (USP) and the Institute for Safe Medication Practices (ISMP).\n\nThe effectiveness of the FDA's drug safety monitoring procedures was called into question after several approved drugs were shown to have serious side-effects. In September 2006, an Institute of Medicine report commissioned by the FDA found that its drug safety system is limited by inadequate funding, insufficient regulatory authority, and a lack of oversight by experts free of pharmaceutical industry ties.\n\nThe FDA launched a new program in 2005 to provide drug risk information directly to the public through internet-accessible drug sheets and bulletins. The enactment of the Food and Drug Administration Amendments Act of 2007 (FDAAA), expanded the authority of the FDA over drug safety monitoring after approval and introduction for use by the public. In 2008, the FDA established a single website for both the public and the healthcare profession with access to drug safety information, including warnings, recalls, and reporting of adverse reactions, using MedWatch.\n\nThe APSF is a non-profit independent organisation founded in 1989 for anaesthesia error monitoring, and expanded to patient incident reporting and monitoring after results from the Quality in Australian Health Care Study (QAHCS) in 1995 prompted reaction from the public. Adverse medical events, both sentinel events (patient death and injury) and near misses (medical errors with potential harm), are reported and analyzed through its subsidiary, Patient Safety International (PSI), using a software tool, the Advanced Incident Management System (AIMS). AIMS is used in over half of Australia's hospitals, and was adopted in 2005 by the New Zealand Accident Compensation Corporation and the University of Miami Medical Group in Florida. Data remains confidential is protected from legal discovery under Australian Commonwealth Quality Assurance legislation. Patient safety information is provided by electronic newsletters.\n\nThe Canadian Patient Safety Institute (CPSI, ) was developed in 2003 after consultations among Canadian healthcare professional organizations, provincial and territorial ministries of health and Health Canada. An independent non-profit corporation, the CPSI promotes solutions and collaboration among governments and stakeholders to improve patient safety, and has a five-year mandate. Areas of improvement are education, system innovation, communication, regulatory affairs and research. Together with the Institute For Safe Medication Practices Canada and Saskatchewan Health, a Canadian Root Cause Analysis Framework is offered to healthcare organizations to analyze the contributing factors that led to a critical incident or close call.\n\nIn April 2005, CPSI launched the \"Safer Healthcare Now!\" campaign, aimed at reducing error-related injuries by focusing on six evidence-based measures and through over 200 local organizations, based on the 100,000 lives campaign.\n\nThe Institute for Safe Medication Practices Canada (ISMP) is an independent national non-profit agency that reviews and analyzes medication incident and near-miss reports. In collaboration with the Canadian Institute for Health Information (CIHI), and Health Canada, ISMP established the Canadian Medication Incident Prevention and Reporting System (CMIRPS) in 2003. ISMP takes the lead role of collecting reports from health practitioners, analysing incidents, and disseminating preventative methods.\n\nBased in Berlin, the German Agency for Quality in Medicine is a not-profit organisation, which co-ordinates healthcare quality programmes. In the field of patient safety AQUMED was one of the first German organisations calling for effective patient safety programs. The agency was co-founder of the German Coalition for Patient Safety. AQUMED established a national network of Critical Incident Reporting Systems. The institution is partner of the international High 5 Project.\n\nThe German Coalition for Patient Safety (APS), established in 2005 and located in Bonn is a German non-profit association of organisations and individuals interested and involved in promotion of patient safety. APS' multidisciplinary working groups develop recommendations for patient safety activities in in- and outpatient healthcare institutions. The recommendations are available as open-access documents and distributed in healthcare institutions for free. APS acting together with the German Agency for Quality in Medicine is a Lead Technical Agency of the High 5 Project.\n\nBased in London, England, the Health Foundation is an independent charity that aims to improve the quality of health care for the people of the United Kingdom. The Safer Patients Initiative, one of the Foundation’s quality and performance improvement programmes, targets reducing medication-related adverse events and errors, reducing infections associated with intensive care units or surgery and improving organisational culture, leadership and expertise in measuring improvement. The goal of the initiative is a 50 percent reduction in adverse events per 1,000 patient days for each site. In 2004, The Health Foundation selected four hospitals from across the UK to work on a £4.3 million patient safety improvement programme. These four hospitals continue to show measurable improvements in their patient safety performance, and 16 more hospitals are being selected in 2006 to join the second phase.\n\nThe Unit was founded in January 2008 and is a collaborative venture between the University Hospitals of Morecambe Bay NHS Trust and Lancaster University. It is funded by the UK National Health Service through the National Institute for Health Research. The unit has two aims. The first is to conduct research in patient safety. The second is to make sure that the unit's findings are used in practice, to improve the welfare of people in North Lancashire and South Cumbria and throughout the National Health Service. In June 2010 the Unit's director, Professor Andrew Smith, helped launch The Helsinki Declaration for Patient Safety in Anaesthesiology, a practical manifesto aimed at improving the safety of anaesthesia care throughout Europe. He is now part of a joint European Society of Anaesthesiology/European Board of Anaesthesiology Task Force overseeing the implementation of the Declaration.\n\nOn November 5, 2008, ECRI Institute PSO was officially listed as a federal Patient Safety Organization under the Patient Safety and Quality Improvement Act of 2005. ECRI Institute Patient Safety Organization serves nationwide as a PSO directly for providers, hospitals, and health systems as well as provide support services to state and regional PSOs.\n\nThe Medication Safety Officers Society formerly known as The American Society of Medication Safety Officers (ASMSO) is a not-for-profit association established in 2006 with a mission to advance and encourage excellence in the profession of pharmacy by providing leadership, direction, education and communication among its members, to represent pharmacy in organized healthcare settings and promote the advancement of safe medication use.\n\nIt was designed for medication safety officers with the goal to provide an open forum of information sharing and collaboration. ASMSO was acquired by the Institute for Safe Medication Practices (ISMP) in 2013 and renamed the Medication Safety Officers Society (MSOS). Membership in MSOS is currently free to all interested parties who register.\n\nThe Missouri Center for Patient Safety (MOCPS) is a private, not-for-profit corporation fostering change throughout Missouri’s health care delivery systems and across the continuum of care. It was established by the Missouri Hospital Association (MHA), the Missouri State Medical Association (MSMA) and Primaris in response to recommendations from the Governor’s Commission for Patient Safety.\n\nInitiatives that are currently the focus of MOCPS include the People, Priorities and Learning Together (PPLT) initiative, which brings together evidence-based practices that have been part of the work of the MOCPS and Missouri Hospital Association. This approach offers options for hospitals to select components of the initiative to fit their own unique needs for quality and safety efforts, providing options to select components of most value to the individual hospital. In addition to opportunities to learn the Comprehensive Unit-based Safety Program (CUSP), TeamSTEPPS™, Just Culture, and other processes to improve teamwork and communication, participants may join clinical collaboratives, including the national CUSP/Stop BSI and CUSP/CAUTI projects focused on prevention of blood stream infections and catheter-associated blood stream infections. Additional initiatives include the Hand Hygiene Project, Prevention of Injury from Falls, and Hospital and Medical Offices Surveys on Patient Safety.\n\nThe Council on Surgical & Perioperative Safety (CSPS) was founded in August 2007 and is incorporated in the State of Illinois. The CSPS is a unique coalition of seven professional organizations representing the entire spectrum of the surgical team. Its voting member organizations include the American Association of Nurse Anesthetists, the American Association of Surgical Physician Assistants, the American College of Surgeons, the Association of periOperative Registered Nurses, the American Society of Anesthesiologists, the American Society of PeriAnesthesia Nurses, and the Association of Surgical Technologists. The CSPS and its member organizations have a combined total of more than 250,000 members and represent more than two million healthcare practitioners.\nThe CSPS promotes excellence in patient safety in the surgical and perioperative environment and works to ensure that all patients receive the safest surgical care provided by an integrated team of dedicated professionals. The CSPS values a culture of patient safety and a caring workplace environment.\nThe CSPS is committed to the following goals and objectives:\n\nStaggered by increasing health insurance costs, several large US companies met in 1998 to influence quality and affordability. The resulting Leapfrog Group agreed to base their purchase of health care on principles that \"encourage provider quality improvement and consumer involvement\". The group was officially launched in November 2000 with the initial focus provided by the 1999 Institute of Medicine report – reducing preventable medical mistakes (the report recommended that large employers leverage their purchasing power for the quality and safety of health care). The \"leapfrog\" concept involved large advances stimulated by rewarding hospitals that implement significant improvements (the Leapfrog Hospital Rewards Program). The quality practices mandated are computerized physician order entry (CPOE), evidence-based hospital referral, intensive care unit (ICU) staffing by physicians experienced in critical care medicine, and a \"Leapfrog Safe Practices Score\", based on the National Quality Forum endorsed Safe Practices. Additional initiatives now include public reporting of health care quality and outcomes (hospital quality ratings) to influence consumers' choices. Leapfrog now includes more than 170 large private and public healthcare purchasers providing health benefits to more than 37 million employees and retirees, funded by the Business Roundtable, the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation and Leapfrog members.\n\nFounded in 1951, the Joint Commission on Accreditation of Healthcare Organizations (JCAHO) is an independent, not-for-profit organization that evaluates and accredits nearly 15,000 health care organizations and programs in the United States. An organization must undergo an on-site survey by a Joint Commission survey team at least every three years. The scope of reviews by JCAHO is broad, including hospitals, home care agencies, medical equipment providers, nursing homes, rehabilitation facilities, surgical centers and medical laboratories. Passing a survey is crucial for most organizations, since accreditation by JCAHO is required for participation in Medicare and some state and private health care programs. Since the accreditation rate is over 90%, there have been questions raised regarding the effectiveness of these surveys.\n\nIn 1997, JCAHO began including outcomes and other performance data into the accreditation process (the \"ORYX initiative\"). Information gained allowed the Joint Commission to develop National Patient Safety Goals to promote specific improvements in patient safety. The Goals highlight problem areas in health care and describe evidence-based solutions. Examples include prevention of falls, patient identification, reducing hospital infections and pressure ulcers, and improving hospital staff communication. In addition, the Joint Commission created a \"do not use\" list of abbreviations in 2004 to avoid acronyms and symbols that lead to misinterpretation.\n\nIdentifying sentinel events and analyzing the root causes has been a focus of JCAHO since 1996; the first eight alerts were published in 1998. The Commission defines a sentinel event as \"any unexpected occurrence involving death or serious physical or psychological injury, or the risk thereof.\" The health care facility experiencing the sentinel event is expected to complete a thorough root cause analysis, make improvements to the underlying processes, and monitor the effectiveness of the changes. Although the cause of most sentinel events is human error, changes in organizational systems will reduce the likelihood of human error in the future and protect patients from harm when human error does occur. Specific causes of sentinel events and the solutions that hospitals then used successfully to reduce risks are publicized by JCAHO annually. Alerts have included issues as varied as wrong site surgery, restraint deaths, transfusion and medication errors and patient abductions.\n\nIn 2005, JCAHO established an International Center for Patient Safety to collaborate with international patient safety organizations to identify, develop and share safety solutions, conduct joint research, and advocate public policy changes. Educational materials to help patients prevent medical errors, sentinel event alerts and other resources are provide on the internet.\n\nThe Institute for Healthcare Improvement (IHI) is an independent not-for-profit organization helping to lead the improvement of health care throughout the world. Founded in 1991 and based in Cambridge, Massachusetts, IHI works to accelerate improvement by building the will for change, cultivating promising concepts for improving patient care, and helping health care systems put those ideas into action.\n\nThe National Patient Safety Foundation is a not-for-profit organization founded in 1996 by the American Medical Association, CNA HealthPro, and 3M, with significant support from the Schering-Plough Corporation. Based on the model of the Anesthesia Patient Safety Foundation, the NPSF provides leadership training, research support, and education. Since 1998, an Annual Patient Safety Congress has been held to promote patient safety and medical error research in the United States. The Foundation publishes the \"Journal of Patient Safety\", containing original papers and reviews, and provides a searchable database on its website of active research projects.\n\nThe United States Pharmacopeia (USP) sets official standards for all prescription and over-the-counter medicines, dietary supplements, and other healthcare products manufactured and sold in the United States, but USP standards are also recognized and used in more than 130 other countries. USP operates two programs to promote patient safety. The Medication Errors Reporting Program enables healthcare professionals to report medication errors directly to USP. MEDMARX, an internet-based error and drug reaction reporting program, is designed for use in hospitals. The USP analyzes the data it receives through its reporting programs, develops professional education programs and disseminates alerts related to medication errors. The MEDMARX report released in 2007 analyzed 11,000 medication errors during surgery in 500 hospitals between 1998 and 2005. The analysis showed that medication errors that happen in the operating room or recovery areas are three times more likely to harm a patient than errors occurring in other types of hospital care. , this was the largest known analysis of medical errors related to surgery.\n\nThe Institute for Safe Medication Practices (ISMP), based in suburban Philadelphia, is a nonprofit organization devoted to preventing medication errors and the safe use of medications. Its medication error prevention efforts began in 1975 with a column in \"Hospital Pharmacy\" to inform healthcare professionals and others about medication error prevention. ISMP operates a voluntary practitioner error-reporting program to tabulate errors nationally, understand their causes, and share “lessons learned” with the healthcare community, known as the Medication Errors Reporting Program (MERP), operated by the United States Pharmacopeia (USP) in cooperation with ISMP. In addition, ISMP’s corporate subsidiary, Med-E.R.R.S. (Medical Error Recognition and Revision Strategies), works directly and confidentially with the pharmaceutical industry to prevent errors that stem from confusing or misleading naming, labeling, packaging, and device design. The ISMP list of error-prone abbreviations is distributed nationally.\nIn EGYPT Egyptian Neonatal Safety Training Network (ENSTN) is a network originated from project funded by Tempus (2013). Its broad objective was to develop and support the establishment of Egyptian Neonatal Safety Training Network in order to promote safe health care practices in neonatal intensive care units (NICU) and prevent inadvertent harm to patients as results of their care through contribution to learning /training of health care workers as neonatologist, pediatricians, nurses, as well as medical students on patient safety (PtS), dissemination and promotion of culture of patient safety. Also to establish protocols and guidelines to enhance continuity of safe practices in NICU& encourage implementation researches on patient safety. One of its specific objective is to foster development of safety culture in NICU that depend on system approach, promote reporting of adverse events, focused on prevention and learning . <https://www.egyneosafety.net >\nThe Safe Care Campaign is a not-for-profit corporation created to help eradicate hospital acquired infections. Its goal is to instigate a national change in ideology and practices within the health care environment in regard to hand hygiene, by emphasizing well-established methods proven to result in safer patient care.\n\n\n<67-Egyptian Neonatal Safety Training Network . https://www.egyneosafety.net></ref>\n\n"}
{"id": "7135499", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=7135499", "title": "Prevalence of tobacco use", "text": "Prevalence of tobacco use\n\nPrevalence of tobacco use is reported by the World Health Organization (WHO), which focuses on cigarette smoking due to reported data limitations. Smoking has therefore been studied more extensively than any other form of consumption.\n\nSmoking is generally five times more prevalent among men than women; however, the gender gap differs across countries and is smaller in younger age groups. In developed countries smoking rates for men have peaked and have begun to decline, and also started to stall or decline for women.\n\nSmoking prevalence has changed little since the mid-1990s, before which time it declined in English-speaking countries due to the implementation of tobacco control. However, the number of smokers worldwide has increased from 721 million in 1980 to 967 million in 2012 and the number of cigarettes smoked increased from 4.96 trillion to 6.25 trillion due to population growth.\n\nIn Western countries, smoking is more prevalent among populations with mental health problems, with alcohol and drug problems, among criminals, and among the homeless.\n\nIn 2002, about 20% of young teens (aged 13–15) smoked worldwide. 80,000 to 100,000 children begin smoking every day. Half of those who begin smoking in adolescent years are projected to go on to smoke for 15 to 20 years.\n\nThe World Health Organization (WHO) states that \"Much of the disease burden and premature mortality attributable to tobacco use disproportionately affect the poor\". Of the 1.22 billion smokers, 1 billion of them live in developing or transitional economies. Rates of smoking have leveled off or declined in the developed world. In the developing world, tobacco consumption is rising by 3.4% per year as of 2002.\n\nThe WHO in 2004 projected 58.8 million deaths to occur globally, from which 5.4 million are tobacco-attributed, and 4.9 million as of 2007. As of 2002, 70% of the deaths are in developing countries.\n\nIt is predicted that 1.5 to 1.9 billion people will be smokers in 2025.\n\nIn Australia the incidence of smoking is in decline, with figures from the 2011-12 Australian Health Survey showing 18% of the population to be current smokers, a decline from 28% in 1989-90.\n\nAmong the indigenous population, the rate was much higher: 50% of men and 44% of women reported being current smokers in 2007–08.\n\nPeople aged 25 to 34 are the most likely to smoke (24%), with a marked decline in smoking rates as age increases past 45 years in 2011-12.\n\nIn 2007–08, the prevalence of smoking was strongly associated with socioeconomic disadvantage: a greater proportion of men (33%) and women (26%) who live in the most disadvantaged 20% of areas were current smokers than those who live in the least disadvantaged 20% of areas (12% and 11% respectively).\n\nIn 2016 the daily smoking rate is less than 13%.\n\nIn December 2002, Statistics Canada published a report on smoking prevalence from 1985-2001. In that report they found from 1985 to 1991, prevalence of \"current smoking\" (which they defined as daily smokers and occasional smokers) declined overall, for both sexes and all age groups except for those aged 15 to 24. Even larger declines occurred from 1991 to 2001. While current smoking prevalence for youths did not significantly change from 1985 to 1994-1995, there was a significant decrease of 6 percentage points from 1994-1995 to 2001 (from 28.5% to 22.5%). Provincially, Newfoundland and Labrador, Nova Scotia, Quebec, Ontario, Saskatchewan, Alberta and British Columbia, experienced most of their declines in current smoking prevalence from 1994-1995 onwards. All of the provinces experienced some level of declines over the entire 1985 to 2001 period. Declines in daily smoking prevalence occurred for both sexes and all age groups over the entire 17-year time span, although youth smoking did not start significantly declining until the mid-1990s. Overall, for daily cigarette consumption, smokers by 2001 had a significantly lower proportion of smoking 26 or more cigarettes daily compared with 1985 (14.0% to 5.8%). Most of the declines in the different sex or age groups occurred after 1991. At the same time however, smokers in 2001 had a significantly higher proportion of smoking 1 to 10 cigarettes daily compared with 1985 (18.6% to 31.1%). Most of the decline occurred after 1991. As of 2008 the rate was estimated to be 18%, and declining. A 2011 survey estimates that 17% of Canadians smoke.\n\nIn 2005, 27% of the population admitted to being current smokers. 23% were regular smokers (28% of men and 19% of women,) while 4% smoked irregularly. The highest ratio of regular smokers was in the 20-24 age group: 38% of men and 30% of women. According to a 2010 study by University of Bielefeld, 9,9% of all 15-year-old males and 10,8% of 15-year-old females smoke daily, which shows a strong decline during the last decade.\n\nLike in the most industrial countries the smoking rate in Germany decreases with increasing education level.\n\nA 2006 comparative study found that 25.1% of male and 20.6% of female medical students in Göttingen smoke, while in London the ratios were only 10.9% and 9.1%.\n\nGermany has the largest number of cigarette vending machines per capita in the world: 800,000 per 82 million people.\n\nIn Israel, smoking prevalence among males had remained relatively constant at 30% in the years 1994–2004. Among females the prevalence has declined slightly from 25% in 1998 to 18% in 2003. For the youth, 14% smoked at least once per week in a 2001 publication.\n\nIn 2005, research has shown that Israeli youths have begun to use bidis and hookah, as alternative methods of tobacco use. In 1990, smoking was the cause of about 1,800 male deaths in Israel which was around 12% of all male deaths. Smoking has not been found to be significant cause of death among Israeli women. The average number of cigarettes smoked per Israeli stands at 2162 (6).\n\nThere are several anti-tobacco use legislations in effect. For instance, advertising is prohibited in youth publications and is forbidden on television and radio. in addition to substantial increases in tobacco taxes, although comparatively the prices are still among the lowest compared to all of the European countries. In addition, until 2004, there was no minimum age requirement for buying tobacco products in Israel, however, an amendment to the tobacco marketing and advertisement law that became effective at 2004 has limited the sale of tobacco to people above the age of 18.\n\nAccording to Israel Central Bureau of Statistics, the smoking rate in the Israeli adult population in 2009 was 20.9%, down from 34% in 2000. A Ministry of Health nationwide survey conducted in 2011 found that 20.6% of the population aged 21 and older were smokers. The highest percentage of smokers was among Arab males, 44% percent of whom smoked, though this figure is down from 50% in 1996.\n\nTobacco consumption in New Zealand peaked in the mid-1970s when 60% of the population were smokers. By 2011 that number had fallen to 20% of the population, thanks to stringent tobacco control laws which are amongst the world's strictest. However, despite these laws, the number of smokers appears to be increasing as the global economy worsens and a recent spate of natural disasters have seen an increase in tobacco sales and although more males smoke than females, this gap is slowly narrowing. Tobacco consumption by Maori remains disproportionately high despite having decreased over recent years thanks to television, internet, radio and print media anti-smoking advertising aimed at Maori. The high rate of Maori tobacco consumption has been described by many Maori health advocates and academics as a \"cultural genocide\".\n\nAccording to the Romanian Ministry of Health, the smoking rate among the general population declined from 36% in 2004 to 26% in 2011. A report commissioned in 2012 revealed that 34.9% of men smoked daily, compared to 14.5% of women, and in the preceding 12 months, 37.8% of regular smokers had attempted to quit at least once. Despite a general decline in smoking prevalence, the rate among women nearly doubled from 1991–2011, with 55% of women smokers belonging to the 15–34 age group.\n\nThe first research of smoking habits in Sweden was performed in 1946; it showed that 50% of men, and 9% of women were smokers. In 1977 41% of men were and 32% of women smokers. The use of smoking tobacco, on a daily basis, had in 2011 decreased to only 12.5% and 14.3% among women. The use of snus, on a daily basis among men older than 15 years, was approximately 19.4% and only 3.0% for women.\n\nFigures from 2013 show that proportion of the British population (UK excluding Northern Ireland) who smoke has fallen to 19%.\nThe Health Survey for England in 2002 found a smoking rate of 26%. By 2007 the proportion of adult smokers in England had declined four percentage points to 22%. In 2015, it was reported smoking rates in England had fallen to only 16.9%, a record low. Overall, the numbers of smokers in the UK in 2007 was estimated at 13.7 million. The rate of smoking amongst the most socioeconomically affluent patients was 14% in 2007 and 34% for the most deprived.\n\nAccording to the CDC, as of 2015, a total of 15.1% of U.S. adults (16.7% of men and 13.6% of women) smoke, which is down from 20.9% a decade earlier. Of U.S. smokers in 2005, 80.8% (or 36.5 million) smoked every day, and 19.2% (or 8.7 million) smoked some days. The prevalence of current cigarette smoking also varied substantially across population groups. For instance, current smoking was higher among men at 23.9% than women at 18.1%. This is consistent with other countries (see table). Among racial and ethnic groups, Native Americans and Alaska Natives had the highest prevalence at 32.0%, followed by non-Hispanic whites at 21.9%, and non-Hispanic blacks at 21.5%. Hispanics at 16.2%, and Asians at 13.3% had the lowest rates.\n\nSmoking prevalence also based on education level, with the highest among adults who had earned a General Educational Development (GED) diploma at 43.2% and those with 9–11 years of education at 32.6%. Prevalence generally decreased with increasing education. Adults aged 18–24 years were at 24.4% and 25–44 years were at 24.1% had the highest prevalences. The prevalence of current smoking was higher among adults living below the poverty line at 29.9% than among those at or above the poverty line at 20.6%.\n\nIn 2005, the CDC set a 2010 target of 12% for current cigarette smoking prevalence. Certain populations had already surpassed these when it was set. This included Hispanic (11.1%) and Asian (6.1%) women, women with undergraduate (9.6%) or graduate (7.4%) degrees, men with undergraduate (11.9%) or graduate (6.9%) degrees, men aged over 65 years (8.9%), and women aged over 65 years (8.3%).\n\nIn 2013, the national smoking average in the United States was 19.6% of the adult population. The following have some of the lowest percentages of smokers with their states: \n\nAmong cigarette smokers in 2005, an estimated 42.5% had stopped smoking for at least 1 day during the preceding 12 months because they were trying to quit. Among the estimated 42.5% (or 91.8 million) of people who had smoked at least 100 cigarettes during their lifetimes (the question the CDC asked to measure if they were ever smokers or not), 50.8% (or 46.5 million) did not smoke currently. In 2005, prevalence of current cigar smoking was 2.2% and current smokeless tobacco use was 2.3%. Prevalence of cigar smoking and use of smokeless tobacco were higher among men (4.3% and 4.5%, respectively) than women (0.3% and 0.2%).\n\nThere are large regional differences in smoking rates, with Kentucky, West Virginia, Oklahoma and Mississippi topping the list, and Idaho, California and Utah at significantly lower rates.\n\nPersons with mental illness, making up about 20% of the population, consume about 33% of the tobacco used. Persons with serious mental illness die 25 years earlier than average, often from smoking related illnesses.\n\nIn November 2015, the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) and Prevention noted in their report, “The percentage of U.S. adults who smoke cigarettes declined from 20.9 percent in 2005 to 16.8 percent in 2014. Cigarette smoking was significantly lower in 2014 (16.8 percent) than in 2013 (17.8 \npercent).” The CDC concluded this from data obtained by a survey of Americans. However, researchers said that they are not sure if products \nlike e-cigarettes are in any way helpful to reduce smokers in the country. Around 4,000 minors start smoking in the US every day.\n\nThe following is a list of countries by the percentage of age-standardized prevalence of tobacco smoking among persons 15 years and older in 2015 as published by the World Health Organization in 2016.\n\nThe following is from the \"table b\" of \"WHO Report on the Global Tobacco Epidemic\" (2008). From the initial survey the data is adjusted making it comparable between countries. Because of this, however, it is not for inferring the prevalence within those countries (\"table a\" provides for this). It contains 135 \"Countries with recent internationally comparable adjusted data\", 18 \"Countries with national data that are neither recent nor comparable internationally\", and 41 \"Countries with no data\". The data represents smoking any tobacco product at the time of the survey including daily and non-daily smoking; the error is with a 95% confidence interval (CI).\n\n\n"}
{"id": "30283592", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=30283592", "title": "Smoking in South Korea", "text": "Smoking in South Korea\n\nSmoking in South Korea is similar to other developed countries in the OECD, with a daily smoking rate of 19.9% in 2013 compared to 20.9% in Germany and 19.3% in Japan. However, male smoking is among the highest at 36.2% while female smoking by far the lowest at 4.3%. The South Korean government aims to take down male smoking rate to the OECD average of 29% by 2020 by making the country one of the world's most difficult places to smoke, using a combination of significant price hikes, mandatory warning photos on cigarette packs, advertising bans, financial incentives and medical help for quitting along with a complete smoking ban in public places including all bars, restaurants and cafes.\n\nSouth Korea enforced strict smoking bans in public places since July 2013, with fines of ₩100,000 won on any spotted smoker and up to ₩5 million won on shop owners not following the law. It is illegal to smoke in all bars and restaurants, cafes, internet cafes, government buildings, kindergartens, schools, universities, hospitals, youth facilities, libraries, children's playgrounds, private academies, subway or train stations and their platforms and underground pathways, large buildings, theaters, department stores or shopping malls, large hotels and highway rest areas. The strict bans came into force gradually beginning with a ban on places larger than 150 square meters in 2012, extended to 100 square meters in 2014, with a full-fledged complete nationwide ban on 1 January 2015.\n\nSmoking arrived in Korea in the early 1600s from Japan and until around 1880, both men and women smoked.\n\nSince 1 January 2015, South Korea has completely banned smoking on all bars, restaurants and cafes regardless of size, including any smoking rooms. Any spotted smoker must pay fines of 100,000 won and up to 5 million won on shop owners not obeying the law. Anyone can report a smoker via calling or sending a text message to a government hotline (in the case of Seoul, the number is 120) with their location address and authorities will raid the reported place, of which a picture of the offending smoker will be taken and fined 100,000 won. Disguised authorities also secretly check random places at random times for offending smokers.\n\nSince 1 January 2015, tobacco prices have nearly doubled to an average of ₩4,500 KRW, and it is illegal to advertise misleading claims such as \"light\", \"mild\", \"low tar\" or \"pure\" on cigarette packs.\n\nFrom December 2016, warning photos such as rotten teeth and black lungs will be mandatory on all cigarette packs.\n\nDiscussion is under way at the National Assembly to pass a law that will raise the prices every year pegged to inflation. The government will pass a law in 2015 to completely ban any form of advertising of cigarettes in convenience stores and make it illegal for tobacco companies to sponsor cultural or sport events.\n\nSmoking is illegal and strictly prohibited in the following premises:\n\n\nIn addition to the nationwide ban laws, Seoul designates the following areas must be smoke-free and any spotted smoker must pay a fine of 100,000 won:\n\n\nIn addition to the nationwide ban laws, several cities designate the following areas must be smoke-free:\n\nPeople who have successfully quit smoking will receive 50,000 to 150,000 KRW as a financial incentive from the government. A 12-week medical help program for quitting is provided at a heavily subsidised cost of 5,000KRW upon the first treatment, reduced to 3,000KRW thereafter. Smoking cessation aids such as bupropion, varenicline and nicotin patches are handed out for free at any participating medical center nationwide. Anyone in need of consulting smoking cessation can dial a hotline and consult a doctor or specialist.\n\nResidents of Seoul's Seocho District will receive a 5 million KRW cash prize if they have successfully quit smoking.\n\nReports suggest that persistently high rates of smoking in the military contribute to the high incidence of male smoking, and negate the efficacy of anti-smoking measures, as many men start smoking during their mandatory 2-year military service. The Public Health Graduate School of Yonsei University completed a 13-year medical study on 1.2 million patients and found that about 73% of male smokers and 18% of female smokers contracted lung cancer. There is rising awareness of the health effects of tobacco. The economy of South Korea loses more than 10 trillion \"won\" a year in terms of health-care expenses and lost man-hours due to smoking-related illness.\n\nEight out of ten teenagers were found to think they should not smoke by looking at cigarette pack warning pictures. According to the Center for Disease Control, 83.1% of teenagers who know cigarette warning pictures responded that they thought smoking cigarettes should not be allowed to smoke. The health authorities have announced that they will replace the cigarette warning label in December and will include a picture symbolizing 'carcinogenicity' in cigarette-type electronic cigarette packs.\n\nLocal smoking etiquette in South Korea is influenced by Confucianism. For instance, smokers generally refrain from, or seek permission before lighting up in the presence of social superiors; a social superior could be a boss, professor, parent, grandparent, or teacher.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "40848543", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=40848543", "title": "Social determinants of health in Mexico", "text": "Social determinants of health in Mexico\n\nSocial determinants of health in Mexico are factors that influence the status of health among certain populations in Mexico. These factors consist of circumstances in which people grow, live, work, and age, as well as the systems put in place to deal with illnesses.\n\nIn Mexico, the health inequality among the population is influenced by such social factors. In the past decade, Mexico has witnessed immense progress within their health care system that has allowed for greater access to health care and a decrease in mortality rate, yet there are still various health inequalities caused by social factors.\n\nSocial determinants of health are useful when identifying risk factors that affect the health of an individual or group. Health is defined as \"the overall condition of someone's body or mind\". As accessed by the World Health Organization, some major determinants of whether one is healthy or not include \"the social and economic environment, the physical environment, and the person's individual characteristics and behaviours\". Social determinants of health, as described by the World Health Organization, include income and social status, education, social support networks, health services, gender, employment status and conditions, and race and ethnicity.\n\nIn Mexico, poverty is reported using the Multidimensional Poverty Index and the Human Development Index. Together, these indicators suggest the overall poverty gradient of Mexico. The government’s social development agency reported a 0.6 percent drop of Mexico’s poverty rate from 2010 to 2012, but there are still 53.3 million people under the poverty line. A major effect of this poverty rate is the continuation of a huge wealth gap. Although there is a huge gap between the top ten percent and the bottom ten percent, Mexico has seen an increase in the percentage of Mexicans who are within the middle-class category.\n\nThe poverty within Mexico can be separated into two categories: moderate and extreme. Both categories total to about 45.5 percent of the total population of 117.3 million people. According to El Consejo Nacional de Evaluación de la Política de Desarrollo Social, also known as Coneval, there was a decrease in the percent of the Mexican population in extreme poverty, but an overall increase in the number of people that fall under the poverty line. The study showed that the extreme poverty rate fell from 11.3 percent to 9.8 percent, while the moderate poverty rate increased from 34.8 percent to 35.6 percent.\n\nThe correlation between poverty and health can be described as a negative relationship in which as poverty increases, health decreases. With a low income, families do not have the desired access to nutrition, resources, and health care as well as a means to reach these necessities.\n\nGender is a major factor that influences the health inequity hiamong the Mexican population. There’s a certain gender bias within general health and specific diseases. Gender inequality can be described as “the departure from parity in the representation of women and men in key dimensions of social life.” In Mexico, machismo still affects many parts of the country and the effect that it has on gender roles in a patriarchal society. According to the World Health Organization, a major step towards improving the overall health of the population would be gender empowerment. \nAccording to the 2012 National Survey of Health and Nutrition (ENSANUT), 38 percent of Mexican women aged 20–29 suffer abuses at home with more than 34.9 percent in public. With results like these, Mexico witnesses a huge gender bias that could explain major problems that emerge from within the household as well as those that partake in the work force. In the Mexican work force, women generally receive lower wages than men, even with educational levels taken into consideration. The median wage for female skilled technicians is 97.3 percent of what their male counterparts make, teachers with 97.6 percent, and female industrial supervisors make 68.4 percent of what males make in that same field. The gender inequity can be emphasized with the fact that there has not been \"a female head of state and has had very few female cabinet members.” This explains the \"26 percent of equality with men in the political sphere\" and that of \"42 percent within the economic and legal spheres.\" This gender inequality produces a gender bias that favors men. Women then lack the necessary access to resources such as medical care, transportation, and nutrition.\n\nLevel of educational attainment is a major determinant of health in Mexico. More education generally leads to increased income, better employment opportunities, and improved living conditions; these, in turn, lead to improved health. The educational system in Mexico has witnessed low enrollment as well as low student-achievement. According to the United Nations Educational, Scientific, and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) Institute for Statistics, 99% of children are enrolled in pre-primary school. Furthermore, 96% of girls and 95% of boys are in primary school. Evaluating data on secondary schools across the nation, only 69% of girls and 66% of boys are enrolled in secondary education. The data also shows that 28% of the population of tertiary age are in tertiary education.\n\nThe low enrollment can be correlated with the need for Mexican families to utilize all means to an income and having the whole family seek employment, even at a young age. A factor that can affect the low student-achievement is the matter of children lacking focus as a result of nutritional deprivation. Health indirectly influences education in the same way that education indirectly influences the health of an individual.\n\nLocation affects overall health and \"chances of leading flourishing lives\". Location affects the daily living conditions that people endure which in turn affects health equity. There are various differences between urban and rural living conditions. According to the 2011 Latin American Report on Poverty and Inequality, over the past decade, both national and urban inequality have decreased, yet rural inequality has increased. World Bank data reports that about 61% of those living in rural areas live in extreme poverty. The major causes for such social and economic gaps between these two sectors come from \"a manifestation of spatially-differentiated patterns of economic development\". A major factor to such disparity is the \"absence of rural development policy planning\", especially because the \"highest public spending on rural development benefits the country’s richest states\".\n\nUrban areas seem to be overpopulated with almost one-third of the population living in four major metropolitan areas-20 million people living in Mexico City alone. This major urbanization represents the differences in living standards as well as access to health and social services. \nThe lack of adequate housing within urbanized cities represents a major problem.\n\nAccording to research conducted by the Office of Population Research from Princeton University, the main causes of mortality in rural areas are infectious diseases and malnutrition. Moreover, chronic disease and other health problems associated with industrialization dominate mortality within urban areas. A report from the World Health Organization states that about 32% of the total urban population in Latin America dwell in slums. Slums do not provide the best access to sufficient living conditions. The same report details \"the shift in population levels of weight towards obesity\" due to nutrition transition that begins in cities.\n\nRural regions in Mexico comprise more than 80% of the land and house around 37 million people (36% of the population). These statistics confirm that Mexico is the country with \"the largest population [that lives] in predominantly rural areas\" within the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development. Additionally, the standards of living in rural populations are much lower than its urban counterpart and the gap is larger than OECD standards. The major drawbacks are the lack of good shelter, adequate drainage, and access to electricity. Within dispersed rural areas, about 68% of the houses had a solid floor, 52% had drainage, yet 87% had electricity.\n\nIn the mid-1990s, the \"Secretaría de Desarrollo Social\" introduced the \"Oportunidades\" program (formerly known as PROGRESA), which is a multi-sector policy that brought upon conditional cash transfers. \"Oportunidades\" dispenses money directly to poor households in return the families send their children to school, health services, and provide them with better nutrition by attending classes. Results from a study published in 2004 show that there have been improvements in overall health associated with better \noutcomes in child health, growth, and development.\n\nIn 2003, Mexico's Congress enacted reforms to Mexico's health legislation that aimed at making health care available nationwide. Mexico's former Minister of Health, Julio Frenk, as the original architect, implemented Seguro Popular which has insured 52.6 million previously-uninsured Mexicans. \nWith the implementation of this universal health care, more Mexicans can now access the health services in their community.\n\nIn 2008, the World Health Organization's Commission on Social Determinants of Health developed a plan of action to tackle the problems that social determinants of health have on health equity. The recommendations consist of \"improving daily living conditions, tackle the inequitable distribution of power, money, and resources, and measure and understand the problem and assess the impact of action.\"\n\n"}
{"id": "2301322", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2301322", "title": "Superfecundation", "text": "Superfecundation\n\nSuperfecundation is the fertilization of two or more ova from the same cycle by sperm from separate acts of sexual intercourse, which can lead to twin babies from two separate biological fathers. The term superfecundation is derived from fecund, meaning the ability to produce offspring. Heteropaternal superfecundation refers to the fertilization of two separate ova by two different fathers. Homopaternal superfecundation refers to the fertilization of two separate ova from the same father, leading to fraternal twins. While heteropaternal superfecundation is referred to as a form of atypical twinning, genetically, the twins are half siblings. Superfecundation, while rare, can occur through either separate occurrences of sexual intercourse or through artificial insemination.\n\nSuperfecundation most commonly happens within hours or days of the first instance of fertilization with ova released during the same cycle. The time window when eggs are able to be fertilized is small. Sperm cells can live inside a female's body for four to five days. Once ovulation occurs, the egg remains viable for 12–48 hours before it begins to disintegrate. Thus, the fertile period can span five to seven days.\n\nOvulation is usually suspended during pregnancy to prevent further ova becoming fertilized and to help increase the chances of a full-term pregnancy. However, if an ovum is released after the female was already impregnated when previously ovulating, a chance of a second pregnancy occurs, albeit at a different stage of development. This is known as superfetation.\n\nHeteropaternal superfecundation is common in animals such as cats and dogs. Stray dogs can produce litters in which every puppy has a different sire. Though rare in humans, cases have been documented. In one study on humans, the frequency was 2.4% among dizygotic twins whose parents had been involved in paternity suits.\n\nGreek mythology holds many cases of superfecundation:\n\n\nIn 1982, twins who were born with two different skin colors were discovered to be conceived as a result of heteropaternal superfecundation.\n\nIn 1995, a young woman gave birth to diamniotic monochorionic twins, who were originally assumed to be monozygotic twins until a paternity suit led to a DNA test. This led to the discovery that the twins had different fathers.\n\nIn 2001, a case of spontaneous monopaternal superfecundation was reported after a woman undergoing IVF treatments gave birth to quintuplets after only two embryos were implanted. Genetic testing supported that the twinning was not a result of the embryos splitting, and that all five boys shared the same father.\n\nIn 2016, an IVF-implanted surrogate mother gave birth to two children: one genetically unrelated child from an implanted embryo, and a biological child from her own egg and her husband's sperm.\n\n\n"}

Following its acquisition of the mineral sands business formerly belonging to South Africa's Exxaro Resources, Tronox is the largest fully integrated seller and marketer of titanium dioxide (TiO) pigment, which provides brightness to applications such as coatings, plastics and paper. Tronox also sells titanium ore – the main feedstock of titanium dioxide - and zircon directly to customers.\n\nTronox is the third-largest titanium feedstock producer, with approximately 10% of global titanium ore production; and the second-largest producer of zircon, with approximately 20% of global production. The company also has an electrolytic and speciality chemicals business that services the paper and battery industries. Formerly a part of the Kerr-McGee Chemical Corporation and based in Oklahoma City since it was spun off from its parent in 2005, the company announced in June 2012 that it was moving its headquarters to Stamford, Connecticut.\n\nThe company was spun off in part to offload its parent company Kerr-McGee's legacy of generations of environmental dumping of toxic waste across 22 states. According to one report, \"Kerr-McGee, rather than pay for the environmental mess it created, decided to shift the liabilities between 2002 and 2006 into Tronox. Kerr-McGee, meanwhile, kept its valuable oil and gas assets.\" Tronox did not reveal the massive hidden liabilities to investors, and after they became known, Tronox dropped to a penny stock in 2009. In response, shareholders sued Anadarko Petroleum Corporation (successor to Kerr-McGee) for keeping the scope of the environmental disaster a secret. In addition the US Federal Government sued Anadarko to pay for the cleanup, and in April 2014 settled on the largest environmental contamination settlement in American history, over $5 billion.\n\nThe company went public in 2005, when Oklahoma City-based Kerr-McGee, which had previously owned the company entirely, issued shares via an IPO on November 21, 2005. It became an independent company in March 2006.\n\nIn the first quarter of 2006, Tronox replaced Meade Instruments on the S&P SmallCap 600 index, when Kerr-McGee distributed the rest of its stock in Tronox under its former NYSE symbol TRX.B, a class B security. TRX.B started regular-way trading on March 31, 2006.\n\nIn 2008, the company's stock price declined significantly, and both classes of stock became penny stocks.\n\nIn September 2008, the company's stock moved from the NYSE to OTC.\n\nOn 14 January 2009, Tronox filed Chapter 11 bankruptcy. It specified that this action did not include the company's non-USA operations.\n\nIn 2009, shareholders of Tronox sued Anadarko Petroleum Corporation (successor to Kerr-McGee) for having misled investors about the large environmental and other debts Tronox would inherit from its parent corporation. The environmental pollution included polluting Lake Mead in Nevada with rocket fuel, leaving behind radioactive waste piles throughout the territory of the Navajo Nation and dumping carcinogenic creosote in communities throughout the East, Midwest and South at its wood-treating facilities.\n\nIn 2009, the Huntsman Corporation announced it would buy certain of Tronox's assets, such as its factories. In late 2009, Tronox terminated this deal.\n\nTronox emerged from Chapter 11 Bankruptcy on February 14, 2011.\n\nTom Casey became CEO in October 2011.\nOn June 15, 2012, Tronox announced that it had completed the acquisition of Exxaro Mineral Sands and combined both entities under Tronox Limited, an Australian holding company. Describing the benefits of the combination, Tronox Limited CEO Tom Casey said, \"We now have the ability to sell into a lucrative titanium feedstock market while assuring our titanium dioxide customers that we have the supply to deliver quality products at reasonable prices.\"\n\nIn April 2014, the federal government reached a $5 billion settlement with Anadarko (successor to Kerr-McGee) in the largest environmental contamination case in American history. According to one report, \"Kerr-McGee, rather than pay for the environmental mess it created, decided to shift the liabilities between 2002 and 2006 into Tronox. Kerr-McGee, meanwhile, kept its valuable oil and gas assets.\" The cost to clean up the mess inherited by Tronox from Kerr-McGee was estimated by the courts to be over $5 billion. There are contaminated sites in 22 states and the Navajo Nation. \"Among the dozens of locations targeted for cleanup under the settlement is a former chemical manufacturing site in Nevada that has led to contamination in Lake Mead, abandoned uranium mines in and around the Navajo Nation, and a Superfund site in Gloucester, N.J., polluted by thorium.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKerr-McGee spun off its chemical business circa 2005-6 after demands were made by corporate raider and major Kerr-McGee shareholder Carl Icahn.\n\nAmong other things, Tronox inherited several radioactive waste sites from Kerr-McGee. These include the Cimarron Fuel Fabrication Site and the Rare Earths Facility. They are, as of 2014, still undergoing cleanup.\n\nIt also inherited the Henderson, Nevada \"BMI\" site. This site had supplied Magnesium and other chemicals beginning around World War II. It eventually leaked perchlorate (used in rocket fuel) into the water table, which subsequently contaminated Lake Mead and the Colorado River, which supply water to millions of people.\n\nExiting bankruptcy in February 2011, Tronox's Chapter 11 plan created the Anadarko litigation trust to pursue Tronox's lawsuit against Anadarko and Kerr-McGee.

He was a prominent figure in Russian Catholicism at the beginning of the 20th century.\n\nZabugin was born into a family of civil servants. In 1903, he graduated with honors from St. Petersburg State University. He was then sent to Italy to do scientific work. While there, he became interested in the Greek Catholic Church, and he talked with the monks of the Byzantine Catholic Monastery of Grottaferrata, including the abbot Antonio Pellegrini, and with a future exarch of the Russian Catholic Church, Leonid Fyodorov.\n\nIn 1907, Zabugin converted to Catholicism from his native religion, Russian Orthodoxy. In 1911, he completed his doctoral thesis. After that, he worked as a professor at the University of Rome, where he taught the history of the Italian Renaissance. He published numerous papers on the history of the Renaissance and Italian humanism, where he sought to emphasize the Christian component of this cultural phenomenon. From 1910 to 1919, he worked as an editor of the journal \"Roma e l'Oriente\" (\"Rome and the East\"), which was published in the monastery of Grottaferrata. He also wrote numerous journal articles on the history of Russian Christianity, interfaith relations, and religious relations between Russia and the rest of Europe. Zabugin actively participated in the church and in the social lives of Russian Catholics in Europe, and he worked with Metropolitan Archbishop Andrey Sheptytsky. Zabugin was the author of the Russian Catholic catechism.\n\nIn June 1917, Zabugin was sent to Russia by the Italian government as a special envoy to strengthen bilateral ties. After the October Revolution, he returned to Italy, where he published \"Mad Giant: The Documentary Chronicles the Russian Revolution\", a book about his impressions of the recent events in Russia.\n\nVladimir Zabugin died on 14 September 1923 in a mountaineering accident in the Alps.\n\n"}

The entry location impacts wheelchair seating positions, parking options, the ability to accommodate other passengers, and storage availability.\n\nAdvantages of a side-entry configuration include: ability to drive from a wheelchair or sit in the front passenger position in a wheelchair or driver position; enter and exit curbside away from traffic; and more storage space. Disadvantages of this style are that it requires a handicap parking space or extra room for ramp deployment and that some driveways are not wide enough to accommodate the vehicle. Over 75% of personal use wheelchair-accessible vehicles employ a side-entry configuration.\n\nA rear-entry configuration can be used for attended applications in which the wheelchair occupant is not driving the vehicle but rather riding as a passenger. One advantage of a rear-entry vehicle is that, with the exception of parallel parking, no extra room is required for a ramp and the side passenger doors aren’t blocked if a folding-style ramp is installed. In addition, mid-passenger seats can be mounted next to the wheelchair position. Other advantages include more ground clearance and more room for long wheelchairs and/or leg rests. Limitations of the rear-entry style are the requirement to enter and exit from a traffic area, the inability to drive from the wheelchair and/or have the wheelchair in the front passenger position, and less storage space.\n\nRamp based modifications are most commonly performed on minivans. In order to provide access for the wheelchair user, the floor on side-entry vehicles is lowered . In rear-entry configuration, the floor is not lowered but rather removed, and a composite or steel tub is inserted.\n\nRamps come in two styles—fold-up or in-floor—and two operating modes—manual or motorized. Fold-up ramps fold in half and stow upright next to the side passenger door in a side-entry configuration or inside the rear access doors in a rear-entry configuration. Fold-up ramps present a lower ramp angle than in-floor ramps; however, in side-entry configurations, they are in the way of the passenger entrance when stowed. In-floor ramps slide into a pocket underneath the vehicle's floor and are only available for side-entry configurations. Folding ramps are available in manual or motorized versions for both entry configurations. However, in-floor ramps are only available as motorized. Power applications may also have a “kneeling feature” that reduces the angle of the ramp by compressing the suspension of the van on the ramp side.\n\nIn addition, portable ramps are available for use with many vehicles and typically do not require any vehicle modification. Portable wheelchair ramps cost much less both to purchase and to maintain. Since they are not attached to the vehicle, they can be also be used for handicapped access for other applications.\n\nMinivans that are most frequently converted:\n\nSome manufacturers also provide wheelchair accessible versions of their out going vehicles.\n\nFull size vans require lifts in the form of a platform that can be raised and lowered from inside the vehicle down to the ground outside.\nThere are many types of lifts available on the market. Mono-arm lifts, double-arm lifts and underbody lifts. Double-arm and underbody lifts are best-able for bigger vehicles such as minibuses or buses used for public transport. They have a bigger platform and higher load capacity so they are suitable even for heavy electric wheelchairs with a heavy occupant (more than 300 kg. in all). A mono-arm Lift is preferable for private transport because it can fit smaller vehicles. A mono-arm lift is lighter and smaller than the other ones and it ensures a clear view when it's installed in the back of the car. Moreover, mono-arm lifts are preferable for the side-door installation because they are thinner than a double-arm.\n\nCrane type lifts are combined with seats that turn and lower to the ground as a means of providing wheelchair access to some types of vehicles.\n\nSome companies offer the option of a \"transfer seat\", in which the front driver's or passenger's seat moves on a track back to the wheelchair's position allowing the wheelchair user to transfer into the OEM front seat and then move the seat back into its original position. The conversion is very simple and does not carry the complicated engineering and electronics typically found in a side-entry conversion. As a result, they are very well suited for commercial and heavy-cycle applications (i.e.-taxi, non-emergency ambulance, paratransit, assisted living, and dial-a-ride) and geographic areas prone to vehicle corrosion from salt and chloride usage on highways in winter seasons.\n\n\n"}

The name, meaning the \"Great Immortal Wong (Huang)\", is the divine form of Huang Chuping or Wong Cho Ping (; c. 328 – c. 386), a Taoist hermit from Zhejiang.\n\nAccording to the text \"Self-Description of Chisongzi\" (赤松子自述; \"Master Red Pine\") kept at the Wong Tai Sin Temple in Hong Kong, Wong Tai Sin was born Huang Chuping (Wong Cho Ping in Cantonese) in 328 in Lanxi, Jinhua, Zhejiang province. Western sources have him listed at c. 284 to 364 CE.\n\nWong Cho Ping is said to have experienced poverty and hunger, becoming a shepherd when he was eight years old. He began practising Taoism at the age of fifteen after meeting an immortal or saintly person on Red Pine Mountain in his hometown. Legend has it that he was able to transform stones into sheep forty years later. Wong Tai Sin later became known as the Red Pine Immortal (赤松仙子), after the mountain where he had his hermitage, and his birthday is celebrated on the 23rd of the eighth lunar month.\n\nIn the early 20th century, Leung Renyan (梁仁菴) spread the devotion to Wong Tai Sin from Xiqiao Mountain (西樵山) in Nanhai County, Guangdong to Wan Chai in Colonial Hong Kong. Leung arrived in Hong Kong in 1915 and upon renting an apartment in Wan Chai 灣仔, set up an altar to Wong Tai Sin in his apartment. He later opened an herbal medicine shop nearby and moved the altar to the back of the shop, where customers could pray to Wong Tai Sin and seek advice for their ailments. Leung would then fill their prescriptions, and the popularity of Wong Tai Sin grew probably due to several successful cures. Leung's shop was destroyed by fire in 1918.\n\nIn 1921, Leung said that he received a message from Wong Tai Sin instructing him to build a new shrine. Leung and some Taoist priests were told to walk 3,000 paces northwards from Kowloon City Pier, eventually stopping at Chuk Yuen Village (竹園村). They marked the place with a piece of bamboo in the ground, and using \"Fu Ji\" (扶乩) to consult Wong Tai Sin, were told that it was an auspicious site. Wong Tai Sin taught them to determine the would-be centre of the temple by three Chinese feet (approximately ) on the right and three Chinese feet backwards of the bamboo mark and the would-be temple was named as \"Chik Chung Sin Shrine\" (赤松仙館) (Red Pine Immortal Shrine). The Taoist god of literature, Wenchang Dijun (文昌帝君), told the priests, again via \"Fu Ji\", to begin construction of the shrine on 24th of the sixth lunar month.\n\nEventually, the shrine was completed and was dedicated on the 20th of the seventh lunar month, and the gods communicated several name changes over the next few years through \"Fu Ji\". In the same year, during the celebration of the birthday of Wong Tai Sin on the 23rd of the eighth lunar month, the altar was named \"Pu Yi Tan\" (普宜壇) by the Jade Emperor (玉帝). Later on, Wenchang Dijun gave the name of the premises as \"Sik Sik Yuen\" (嗇色園) and the managing body was established. In 1925, the shrine was renamed \"Chik Chung Wong Sin Hall\" (赤松黃仙祠) (Red Pine Wong Immortal Hall) by the god Lü Ju (呂祖), and it has been in use since then.\n\nSik Sik Yuen was once restricted to Taoists and their family members until 1934, when it formally applied to the government to have the temple open to the public during every 1st lunar month. The temple was finally opened to the general public in 1956.\n\nThe revival of venerating Wong Cho Ping as Wong Tai Sin occurred at the end of the 19th century. Prior to 1911, the Emperor of China was the primary divine religious symbol, often stretching the Mandate of Heaven into religious terms. After the fall of the Qing Dynasty, a replacement symbol was needed, and Leung Renyan arrived in Hong Kong in 1915 with a portrait of the god; it is thus disputed whether the success of Wong Tai Sin Temple is due to the timing of his worship's revival and historical circumstance.\n\nThe Wong Tai Sin area and Wong Tai Sin districts are named after the deity. Today, Sik Sik Yuen is an educational and charitable foundation that, true to Leung's origins as a healer, runs a free clinic.\nIn Hong Kong, there is one MTR station named after Wong Tai Sin and there is a Wong Tai Sin Temple. Many tourists from all over the world visit Wong Tai Sin Temple every day.\n\n\n"}
