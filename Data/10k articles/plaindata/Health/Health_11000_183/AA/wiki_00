{"id": "12633794", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=12633794", "title": "ASTM E 1714", "text": "ASTM E 1714\n\nASTM E 1714 is a Standard Guide for Properties of a Universal Healthcare Identifier (UHID). This standard was create by the Association for Information and Image Management and ASTM International. \n\nIt defines thirty characteristics required of a UHID. The scope of the guide does not include implementation methodology, cost, or policy decisions. Encrypted UHIDs (EUHIDs) are included in the guide for hiding the identity of individuals while linking information. Separate EUHIDs are allowed for different episodes of care for the same patient. The guide also recommends the use of temporary patient identifiers (TPIs) controlled by individual organizations for emergency use and requires them to subsequently transfer all information to the correct UHID.\n\nAccessible: Access is dependent upon the establishment of a network infrastructure, the trusted authority and policies and procedures that support the system.\n\nAssignable: Assignment of the Sample UHID or EUHID, regardless of time or place of request, depends on the establishment and functions of a network infrastructure, the trusted authority, and the implementation of policies and procedures that support the system. It will also depend on the mechanism to request a Sample UHID. \n\nIdentifiable: This will depend on the identification information that the trusted authority links to the Sample UHID.\n\nVerifiable: The Sample UHID includes a six (6) digit check-digit for verification.\n\nMergeable: The internal data structure of the Sample UHID does not directly support merging duplicate or redundant identifiers. They can be linked at the trusted authority. \n\nSplittable: There is no inherent support for splitting the Sample UHID. New IDs can be issued for future use. Splitting for retroactive information must be handled by the trusted authority.\n\nLinkable: The Sample UHID has the ability to function as a data element and support the linkage of health records in both manual and automated environment.\n\nMappable: With the use of appropriate database system and software, the Sample UHID can be used to map currently existing healthcare identifiers.\n\nContent Free: The Sample UHID is free of information about the individual. \n\nControllable: This depends on the policies and methods that will be adopted by the trusted authority.\n\nHealthcare Focused: The Sample UHID is recommended solely for the purpose of healthcare application.\n\nSecure: The Sample UHID includes an EUHID which offers mechanism for secure operation through the use of encryption and decryption processes. These capabilities depend on the policies and procedures that will be implemented by the trusted authority.\n\nDissidentifiable: EUHID supports multiple encryption schemes offering multiple EUHIDs to prevent revealing the identification of the individual. \n\nPublic: The EUHID's encryption scheme is intended to hide the identity of individual when linking information. However, public disclosure of a patient identifier without any risk to the privacy and confidentiality of patient information depends on appropriate access security and privacy legislation, similar to other identifiers.\n\nBased on Industry Standards: The Sample UHID is not based on existing industry standards. It is based on ASTM's Standard Guide for Properties of a Universal Healthcare Identifier (UHID). \n\nDeployable: The Sample UHID is capable of implementation in a variety of technologies such as scanners, bar code readers, etc. \n\nUsable: The Sample UHID is capable of implementation in a variety of technologies such as scanners, bar code readers, etc. The 28 digit identifier will present difficulty for manual computation and transcription. It may be a time-consuming process and subject to human errors.\n\nThe ASTM guide and the proposed Sample UHID do not address the implementation issues and infrastructure requirements. \n\nUnique: The trusted authority will be responsible for the uniqueness of the Sample UHID. \n\nRepository-based: The Sample UHID can be stored in a repository.\n\nAtomic: The Sample UHID consists of a sixteen (16) digit sequential identifier, a one (1) character delimiter, a six (6) digit check-digit and a six (6) digit encryption scheme. It can function as a single compound data element.\n\nConcise: The Sample UHID is not concise. It is a 29-character length identifier.\n\nUnambiguous: The Sample UHID is unambiguous. It uses numeric characters and a period as a delimiter. \n\nPermanent: The Sample UHID has sufficient capacity to prevent reuse of identifiers.\n\nCentrally governed: This policy issue is not addressed. The Sample UHID requires central administration and is dependent on the establishment and functions of a trusted authority. \n\nNetworked: The Sample UHID can be operated on a computer network. It requires establishment of the necessary network and technology infrastructure.\n\nLongevity: The Sample UHID can support patient identification for a foreseeable future.\n\nRetroactive: Has the capacity for retroactive assignment of the Sample UHID to every person in the United States\n\nUniversal: Can support patient identification for the entire world population\n\nIncremental Implementation: The Sample UHID can be implemented on an incremental basis. With the development and use of appropriate procedures and establishment of the necessary bidirectional mapping, both the Sample UHID and existing patient identifiers can co-exist during the time of transition.\n\nCost-effectiveness: The Sample UHID has the potential to support the functions of a Unique Patient Identifier. The establishment of both the administrative and technology infrastructures, the creation of a Trusted Authority, the design and development of computer software, hardware and communication networks, and the implementation security measures will require substantial investment of resources, time and effort.\n\n"}

{"id": "45449589", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=45449589", "title": "AntiGravity Fitness", "text": "AntiGravity Fitness\n\nAntiGravity Fitness is a fitness company founded by Christopher Harrison in 2007 and based in New York City, specializing in hybrid aerial fitness techniques that combine silk hammocks with yoga practices, Pilates, ballet barre exercises, and traditional strength training techniques into different exercise curriculums. Harrison first developed the initial program, AntiGravity Aerial Yoga, based on backstage warm-up exercises through which he would lead his athletes as director/choreographer of the performance troupe AntiGravity, Inc.\n\nSince 2007, Harrison has developed seven proprietary fitness programs under the AntiGravity Fitness brand, currently licensed in fitness centers in over 40 countries. AntiGravity Fitness also operates instructor training programs as part of their licensing agreements, certifying others to teach AntiGravity Fitness techniques.\n\nIn 1991, Christopher Harrison founded the acrobatic troupe AntiGravity to choreograph a performance for the New York Marathon. In the following decade, they performed in hundreds of live shows, corporate events, and advertising campaigns. Then in 1997, AntiGravity performed during the opening ceremonies of the Femina Miss India pageant, and Harrison, while unable to perform due to injury, cites this time in India as his first exposure to yoga and a major influence on the development of aerial yoga and what would become AntiGravity Fitness.\n\nLater, during a retreat at Club Med, Harrison and his performers came across a gazebo with hammocks hanging from the ceiling. After experimenting and developing a few flips, they hung up similar hammocks in their New York City gym. Harrison states that they soon discovered that “hanging upside down for a minute would take all the kinks out.” The hammocks soon became a regular part of their warm-up routine.\n\nIn 2007, Harrison launched AntiGravity Fitness which focused on aerial yoga.\n\nBy 2012, the chain had locations in China, Indonesia, Russia and Brazil. In June 2014, the first AntiGravity fitness studio, Fighting Gravity Fitness, opened in Virginia. The following October, the first AntiGravity yoga studio opened in Pennsylvania.\n\nAntiGravity classes are led by instructors trained in the programs, and typically last for 75 minutes. Before classes start, hammocks are adjusted to the individual heights of the students, and each lesson begins and ends with guided meditations inside the hammock, referred to as “Womb Pose.” Students are then led by their instructor through a series of motions and poses adapted for the hammocks from yoga, Pilates, ballet, and other exercise techniques, typically focusing on flexibility and core development.\n\nOne cornerstone of AntiGravity techniques is the concept of “zero-compression inversions.” During the inversions, students hang upside-down, supported at the waist and hip by the hammock, relieving pressure from the neck and spine and increasing blood flow to the brain. Christopher Harrison and some students credit these inversions with a temporary increase in body height of up to an inch or more.\n\nAntiGravity Fitness's first licensed technique was named AntiGravity Aerial Yoga, which Harrison credits as the catalyst of the growing aerial yoga genre. AntiGravity Fitness currently teaches eight programs of different levels under their trademarked name, based on various exercise techniques: AntiGravity Aerial Yoga, AntiGravity Fundamentals, AntiGravity Pilates, AntiGravity Restorative Yoga, AntiGravity Suspension Fitness, AntiGravity Kids, AntiGravity AIRbarre, and AntiGravity 1on1.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "679680", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=679680", "title": "Asymptomatic carrier", "text": "Asymptomatic carrier\n\nAn asymptomatic carrier (healthy carrier or just carrier) is a person or other organism that has become infected with a pathogen, but who display no signs nor symptoms.\n\nAlthough unaffected by the pathogen themselves, carriers can transmit it to others or develop symptoms in later stages of disease. Asymptomatic carriers play a critical role in the transmission of common infectious diseases such as typhoid, \"C. Difficile,\" influenzas, and HIV. While the mechanism of disease carrying is still unknown, researchers have made progress towards understanding how certain pathogens can remain dormant in a human for a period of time. A better understanding of asymptomatic disease carriers is crucial to the fields of medicine and public health as they work towards mitigating the spread of common infectious diseases.\n\nAsymptomatic carriers can be further categorized by their current disease state.  When an individual transmits pathogens immediately following infection but prior to developing symptoms, they are known as incubatory carriers. Humans are also capable of spreading disease following a period of illness. Typically thinking themselves cured of the disease, these individuals are known as convalescent carriers. Viral diseases such as hepatitis and poliomyelitis are frequently transmitted in this manner. Considered to the be classic asymptomatic carriers, “healthy carriers,” exhibit no signs or symptoms of disease yet are capable of infecting others.\n\nThe limited information on the prevalence of asymptomatic carriers creates a considerable difficulty when planning public health initiatives. Given that disease surveillance is dependent on estimates for both the asymptomatic rates and symptomatic rates of disease, the lack of information on the prevalence of carriers can lead to insufficient initiatives for the mitigation of common public health concerns such as \"C. Difficile\" or influenza.\n\nResearchers have expressed desire to better predict transmission methods in order to determine the appropriate public health response. For example, a disease with a known low asymptomatic rate may lead to increased surveillance of symptomatic cases, whereas a higher asymptomatic rate could lead to more aggressive methods such as travel-bans, compulsory quarantines since the number of infectious cases would be unknown.\n\nWhile an exact explanation for aymsptomatic carriage is unknown, reasearchers have been dedicating their efforts towards understanding how specific bacteria thrive in human hosts in the hopes of determining a universal understanding of asymptomatic transmission.\n\nNumerous research publications have demonstrated how salmonella is able to remain in immune cells and alter their metabolic systems in order to further transmit the disease.Utilizing a closely related strand of bacterium (\"S. typhimurium\"), scientists have been able to create a mouse model that mimicks the persistent salmonella cases seen in carriers of typhoid. Knowing that the bacterium can reside in mice for their entire lives, researchers have been able to determine that the bacterium tends to reside in macrophages. Further examination of the gut lymph nodes of the mice reveals that \"S. typhimurium\" changes the inflammatory response of the macrophages. Instead of eliciting an inflammatory response from the attack cells, the bacterium is able to convert them into an anti-inflammatory macrophage, allowing for optimal survival conditions. In the words of lead scientist Dr. Monack, “It wasn’t that inflammatory macrophages were invulnerable to infection, but rather that, having infected a macrophage, \"S. typhimurium\" was much more able to replicate in the anti-inflammatory type”\n\nInvestigators have also found that the presence of peroxide-proliferation-induced receptors, or PPARs, correlated to the presence of salmonella bacterium. PPARs, thought of as roaming genetic switches, are responsible for the fat metabolism needed to sustain anti-inflammatory macrophages in which \"S. typhimurium\" hides.\n\nAsymptomatc bacteriuria is a condition that typically impacts 3-5% of women, with the most vulnerable populations being the elderly and those diagnosed with diabetes. Within the female population, the risk of bacteriuria increases with age. \"Escherichia coli\" is the most common organism found during urine anylsis though the variety of potentially infectious organisms is diverse and can include Enterobacteriaceae, \"Pseudomonas aeruginosa\", Enterococcus species, and group B streptococcus. The Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality has issued a set of screening recommendations as well as offered some inisght into the mechanism of bacteriuria. Results of the meta-anylsis produced no clear explanation for asymptomatic carriage, but did yield new evidence that strengthened the support for screening for asymptomatic bacteriuria in pregnant women only.\n\nAsymptomatic carriers have furthered the spread of many infectious diseases. A common principle in epidemiology, the 80-20 rule speculates that 80% of the disease transmission is conducted by only 20% of people in a population. Carriers are responsible for significant bacterium transmission in many common diseases such as the flu, but may also contribute to the spread of less common infections.\n\nTyphoid fever is an ailment caused by bacterium \"Salmonella enterica\" ser. Typhi. An individual can acquire this infection from consuming risky foods or drinks, or by consuming foods or drinks prepared by an infected individual. (Hence, Typhoid Mary.) Those who recover from this infection can still carry the bacteria in their cells, and therefore be asymptomatic.\nMary Mallon, known as \"Typhoid Mary\", was an asymptomatic carrier of \"Salmonella\" \"enterica\" serovar typhi, the causative agent of typhoid fever. A  cook for several families and soldiers in New York City during the late 1800’s, several cases of typhoid fever were traced to her by the Health Department. At the time, there was no way of eradicating the disease, and it was spread primarily through fecal-oral transmission. Most of Mary Mallon's transmission risk was thought to arise from her continued involvement in occupations involving food preparation and handling. New York City's public health officials initially sought to merely restrict her from such employment rather than permanently quarantining her. When she continued to be non-compliant, the Health Commission ordered that she be quarantined on one of the islands surrounding Manhattan. She remained there until her death.\n\nDespite appearing perfectly healthy, it is estimated that Mary infected about 50 people before she was quarantined.Scientists calculate that between 1% and 6% of individuals infected with \"Salmonella\" \"typhi\" become chronic, asymptomatic carriers like Mary.\n\nHIV infection has a long period during which the person is asymptomatic. Although the host may not be experiencing symptoms, the virus can still be passed on to others. It is also possible for the infection to become symptomatic after this latent period. Whether the host is showing symptoms or not, opportunistic infections can take advantage of the weakened immune system and cause further complications.\n\nMany carriers are infected with persistent viruses such as Epstein-Barr Virus (EBV), which is a member of the herpes virus family. Studies show that about 95% of adults have antibodies against EBV, which means they were infected with the virus at some point in their life. \n\nClostridium difficile has also been shown to be spread by asymptomatic carriers, and poses significant problems in care home settings. Reports indicating that over 50% of long-term patients presented with fecal contamination despite a lack of symptoms have led many hospitals to extend the contact precautions period until discharge. \n\nChlamydia, an STI that affects both men and women, can also be asymptomatic in most individuals. Although the infection is not yielding any symptoms, it can still damage the reproductive system. If the infection goes unnoticed for a long time, the infected individual(s) are at risk of developing pelvic inflammatory disease (PID). Like Chlamydia, PID can also be asymptomatic. \n\nA small number of asymptomatic carriers (referred to as \"chronic excretors\") continue to produce active virus for years (or even decades) after their initial exposure to the oral Sabin vaccine. Carriers of the attenuated virus unintentionally spread the attenuated virus, inoculating others, giving them contact immunity; however some adults with weak immune systems have contracted paralytic polio from contact with recently immunized children. Carriers of virulent strains spread polio, increasing the difficulty of poliomyelitis eradication.\n\nTuberculosis (TB) is an infectious disease usually caused by the bacterium \"Mycobacterium tuberculosis\" (MTB). Tuberculosis generally affects the lungs, but can also affect other parts of the body. Active or symptoamtic tuberculoisis is spread from person to person through the air through baterium spores that are released into the air following a cough or sneeze. Some individuals may be infected with the mycobacterium tuberculosis but never display symptoms. Called latent turberculosis,these cases while uncontagious are particularly problemtatic from a public health perspective since approximately 10% of those diagnosed with latent TB will go on to develop an active (and contagious) case.\n"}

{"id": "772026", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=772026", "title": "Blepharitis", "text": "Blepharitis\n\nBlepharitis ( ) is one of the most common ocular conditions characterized by inflammation, scaling, reddening, and crusting of the eyelid. This condition may also cause burning, itching, or a grainy sensation when introducing foreign objects or substances to the eye. Although blepharitis is not sight-threatening, it can lead to permanent alterations of the eyelid margin. The overall etiology is a result of bacteria and inflammation from congested meibomian oil glands at the base of each eyelash. Other conditions may give rise to blepharitis, whether they be infectious or noninfectious, including, but not limited to, bacterial infections or allergies.\n\nDifferent variations of blepharitis can be classified as seborrheic, staphylococcal, mixed, posterior or meibomitis, or parasitic. In a survey of US ophthalmologists and optometrists, 37% to 47% of patients seen by those surveyed had signs of blepharitis, which can affect all ages and ethnic groups. One single-center study of 90 patients with chronic blepharitis found that the average age of patients was 50 years old.\n\nBlepharitis is characterized by chronic inflammation of the eyelid, usually at the base of the eyelashes. Symptoms include inflammation, irritation, itchiness, a burning sensation, excessive tearing, and crusting and sticking of eyelids. Additional symptoms may include visual impairment such as photophobia and blurred vision. Symptoms are generally worse in the mornings and patients may experience exacerbation and several remissions if left untreated. It is typically caused by bacterial infection or blockage of the meibomian oil glands. Diseases and conditions that may lead to blepharitis include: rosacea, herpes simplex dermatitis, varicella-zoster dermatitis, molluscum contagiosum, allergic dermatitis, contact dermatitis, seborrheic dermatitis, staphylococcal dermatitis, demodicosis (Demodex), and parasitic infections (\"e.g.\", Demodex and Phthiriasis palpebrarum).\n\nThe parasite, \"Demodex folliculorum\" (\"D. folliculorum\"), causes blepharitis when the parasite is present in excessive numbers within the dermis of the eyelids. These parasites can live for approximately 15 days. The parasites (both adult and eggs) live on the hair follicle, inhabiting the sebaceous and apocrine gland of the human lid. Direct contact allows this pathogen to spread. Factors that allow this pathogen to multiply include hypervascular tissue, poor hygienic conditions, and immune deficiency. In treating Blepharitis caused by \"D. folliculorum\", mechanical cleaning and proper hygiene are important towards decreasing the parasites numbers. \n\nAssociated Symptoms:\n\nChronic blepharitis may result in damage of varying severity and, in the worst cases, may have a negative effect on vision. This can be resolved with a proper eyeglass prescription. Long-term untreated blepharitis can lead to eyelid scarring, excess tearing, difficulty wearing contact lenses, development of a stye (an infection near the base of the eyelashes, resulting in a painful lump on the edge of the eyelid) or a chalazion (a blockage/bacteria infection in a small oil glands at the margin of the eyelid, just behind the eyelashes, leading to a red, swollen eyelid), chronic pink eye (conjunctivitis), keratitis, and corneal ulcer or irritation. The lids may become red and may have ulcerate, non-healing areas that may lead to bleeding. Blepharitis can also cause blurred vision due to a poor tear film. Tears may be frothy or bubbly, which can contribute to mild scarring along the eyelids. Symptoms and signs of blepharitis are often erroneously ascribed by the patient as \"recurrent conjunctivitis\".\n\nStaphylococcal blepharitis and Posterior blepharitis or \"rosacea-associated\" blepharitis Symptoms\n\nSymptoms include a foreign body sensation, matting of the lashes, and burning. Collarette around eyelashes, a ring-like formation around the lash shaft, can be observed. Other symptoms include loss of eyelashes or broken eyelashes. The condition can sometimes lead to a chalazion or a stye. Chronic bacterial blepharitis may also lead to ectropion. Posterior blepharitis or \"rosacea-associated\" blepharitis is manifested by a broad spectrum of symptoms involving the lids including inflammation and plugging of the meibomian orifices and production of abnormal secretion upon pressure over the glands.\n\nThe mechanism by which the bacteria causes symptoms of blepharitis is not fully understood and may include direct irritation of bacterial toxins and/or enhanced cell-mediated immunity to S. aureus.\n\nStaphylococcal blepharitis is caused by an infection of the anterior portion of the eyelid by Staphylococcal bacteria. In a study of ocular flora, 46% to 51% of those diagnosed with staphylococcal blepharitis had cultures positive for Staphylococcus aureus in comparison to 8% of normal patients. Staphylococcal blepharitis may start in childhood and continue into adulthood. It is commonly recurrent and it requires special medical care. The prevalence of Staphylococcus aureus in the conjunctival sac and on the lid margin varies among countries, likely due to differences in climate and environment. Seborrheic blepharitis is characterized by less inflammation than Staphylococcal blepharitis; however, it causes more excess oil or greasy scaling. Meibomian Gland Dysfunction is a result of abnormalities of the meibomian glands and altered secretion meibum, which plays an imperative role in lagging the evaporation of tear films and smoothing of the tear film to produce an even optical surface. Posterior blepharitis is an inflammation of the eyelids, secondary to dysfunction of the meibomian glands. Like anterior blepharitis, it is a bilateral chronic condition and may be associated with skin rosacea. There is growing evidence that, in some cases, it is caused by Demodex mites.\n\nDiagnosis of the condition is done via a physical examination under a slit lamp. Cultures of debris are occasionally collected for bacterial or fungal testing.\n\nIn all forms of blepharitis, optometrists or ophthalmologists examine the tear film, which is the most efficient method in determining instability. The most frequently used method is to measure tear production via tear break-up time (TBUT), which calculates the duration interval between complete blinks. This serves as a primary indication of regional dryness in the pre-corneal tear film after fluorescein injections. If TBUT is shorter than 10 seconds, then this suggests instability.\n\nStaphylococcal blepharitis is diagnosed by examining erythema and edema of the eyelid margin. Patients may exhibit alopecia areata of eyelashes and/or growth misdirection, trichiasis. Other signs may include telangiectasia on the anterior eyelid, collarettes encircling the lash base, and corneal changes. Seborrheic blepharitis is distinguished by less erythema, edema, and telangiectasia of the eyelid margins. Posterior blepharitis and Meibomian gland dysfunction are frequently associated with rosacea and can be seen during an ocular examination of the posterior eyelid margin. The Meibomian glands may appear caked with oil or visibly obstructed.\n\nCultures of the eyelid margins can be a clear indicator for patients suffering from recurrent anterior blepharitis with severe inflammation, in addition to patients who are not responding to therapy. Measurements of tear osmolarity may be beneficial in diagnosing concurrent dry eye syndrome (DES), which may be responsible for overlapping symptoms and would allow the physician to decipher between conditions and move forward with the most beneficial protocol for the patient. Consequently, the measurement of tear osmolarity has various limitations in differentiating between aqueous deficiencies and evaporative dry eye. Microscopic evaluation of epilated eyelashes may reveal mites, which have been evident in cases of chronic blepharoconjunctivitis. A biopsy of the eyelid can also determine the exclusion of carcinoma, therapy resistance, or unifocal recurrent chalazia.\nBlepharitis is a result of bacteria and inflammation from congested meibomian oil glands at the base of each eyelash. Routine washing of the eyelids helps subdue symptoms and prevent blepharitis. Washing each eyelid for 30 seconds, twice a day, with a single drop of hypoallergenic soap (e.g. baby shampoo) and ample water can help. The most effective treatment is over the counter lid scrubs used twice a day. Some doctors may recommend using a hypochloric acid treatment depending on the severity. \n\nBlepharitis is a chronic condition causing frequent exacerbation, thus requires routine eyelid hygiene. Hygienic practices include warm compresses, eyelid massages generating consistent heat at body temperature (98.6 degrees F), and eyelid scrubs. A Cochrane Systematic Review of topical antibiotics was shown to be effective in providing symptomatic relief and clearing bacteria for individuals with anterior blepharitis. Topical steroids provided some symptomatic relief, but they were ineffective in clearing bacteria from the eyelids. Lid hygiene measures such as warm compresses and lid scrubs were found to be effective in providing symptomatic relief for participants with anterior and posterior blepharitis.\n\nWarm compresses: \"Soften lid margin debris and oils\" by placing a very warm wet compress such as a clean, warm, wet washcloth over the closed eyelids for five minutes. Re-wet and reapply it as it cools. This warms, softens, and loosens crusty and oily eyelid gland deposits.\n\nEyelid hygiene: \"Remove lid margin debris\" immediately after the warm compresses by gently washing the eyelids with a warm, wet, soapy washcloth to remove accumulated debris. Use a diluted, hypoallergenic baby shampoo. Gently rub along the lid margins, keeping the eyes shut. Too much soap or shampoo may remove the essential oil layer of the eyes' tear film and create further stress to the eye, as well as dry eye discomfort. A moist cotton swab soaked in a cup of water and baby shampoo may be used to rub along the lid margins while tilting the lid outward with the other hand to avoid this problem. Finally, rinse the eyelid with warm water and gently dry with a towel. \"Eye make-up\" should not be used while inflammation is present. \"Dandruff shampoo\" can be helpful if dandruff is contributing to blepharitis and may relieve blepharitis symptoms.\n\nOral antibiotics: Ophthalmologists or optometrists may prescribe a low-dose, oral antibiotic such as Doxycycline.\n\nTopical antibiotics: If prescribed, topical creams or ointments can be applied after the cleansing of the lid margin. A small amount of antibiotic ophthalmic ointment is spread along the lid fissure with a swab or fingertip, while the eyes are closed. It is prescribed for use prior to bedtime to avoid blurred vision. Another method to reduce side effects of blepharitis are antibiotics such as erythromycin or sulfacetamide, which are used via eye drops, creams, or ointments on the eyelid margin. blepharitis caused by Demodex mites can be treated using a diluted solution of tea tree oil, via application by a cotton swab, for 5–10 minutes per day.\n\nSteroid eyedrops/ointments: Eye drops or ointments containing corticosteroids are frequently used in conjunction with antibiotics and can reduce eyelid inflammation.\n\nHypochlorous acid products: Both over-the-counter and prescription products with hypochlorous acid (HOCl) can be used to alleviate the signs and symptoms of blepharitis. In a recent study, a saline hygiene solution with hypochlorous acid was shown to reduce the bacterial load significantly without altering the diversity of bacterial species on the eyelids. After 20 minutes of treatment, there was >99% reduction of the Staphylococci bacteria, which is a common cause of blepharitis.\n\nBlepharitis is a chronic condition that has periods of exacerbation and remission. Patients should be informed that symptoms can frequently improve but are rarely eliminated. Infrequently, severe blepharitis can result in permanent alterations in the eyelid margin or vision loss from superficial keratopathy, corneal neovascularization, and ulceration. Patients with an inflammatory eyelid lesion that appears suspicious of malignancy should be referred to an appropriate specialist.\n\nA study conducted in November 2017, conveyed a correlation between blepharitis and early onset metabolic syndrome (MetS). To investigate the relationship between blepharitis and MetS, researchers used the Longitudinal Health Insurance Database in Taiwan. Results indicated that hyperlipidaemia and coronary artery disease were significantly correlated with the prior development of blepharitis. Therefore, blepharitis was shown to be significantly related to MetS and can serve as an early indication of the condition.\n\nIn another recent study, the presence of Demodex has been unveiled as a common cause of blepharitis. However, the pathogenesis of demodicosis is still unclear. In this study, researchers provide a diagnosis of the disease and propose diagnostic criteria of Demodex blepharitis.\n\n"}

{"id": "41525316", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=41525316", "title": "Charlotte's web (cannabis)", "text": "Charlotte's web (cannabis)\n\nCharlotte's Web is a high-cannabidiol (CBD), low-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) \"Cannabis\" strain marketed as a dietary supplement under federal law of the United States. It is produced by the Stanley brothers in Colorado. It does not induce the psychoactive \"high\" typically associated with recreational marijuana strains that are high in THC. In September 2014, the Stanleys announced that they would ensure that the product consistently contained less than 0.3% THC.\nCharlotte's Web is named after Charlotte Figi, born , whose story has led to her being described as \"the girl who is changing medical marijuana laws across America.\" Her parents and physicians say she experienced a reduction of her epileptic seizures brought on by Dravet syndrome after her first dose of medical marijuana at five years of age. Her usage of Charlotte's Web was first featured in the 2013 CNN documentary \"Weed\". Media coverage increased demand for Charlotte's Web and similar products high in CBD, which has been used to treat epilepsy in toddlers and children. It was originally called \"Hippie's Disappointment\" as it was a strain that had high CBD and could not induce a \"high\". \nWhile anecdotal reports have sparked interest in treatment with cannabinoids, there is not enough evidence to draw conclusions about their safety or efficacy. Physicians worry that some parents are willing to try treatments before proper research has been conducted, and that they may be disappointed. They are \"alarmed by parallels to past miracle-cure manias later proved false...\" and \"...wary of the heightened placebo effect in treatments involving children, when reports of progress depend on the view of parents.\"\n\nIn 2014, there was little evidence about the safety or efficacy of cannabinoids in the treatment of epilepsy. A 2014 Cochrane review did not find enough evidence to draw conclusions about its use. A 2014 review by the American Academy of Neurology similarly concluded that \"data are insufficient to support or refute the efficacy of cannabinoids for reducing seizure frequency.\"\n\nThe Cochrane review suggests cannabinoids be reserved for people with symptoms that are not controllable by other means, who have been evaluated by EEG-video monitoring to confirm diagnosis, and are not eligible for better established treatments such as surgery and neurostimulation. A second review described four placebo-controlled trials of cannabadiol including 48 people with a disease that was not manageable by other means. Three out of four trials reported some reduction in seizures, but no comparison with placebo was possible due to the small number of people in the trials. The drugs were well tolerated. A third review found that no reliable conclusions about the effect of cannabis on epilepsy could be drawn due to the poor quality of available data, but further research may be warranted because of the good safety profile observed in small clinical trials.\n\nA 2017 study in children with drug-resistant Dravet syndrome, using a comparatively high dose of 20 mg/kg, found cannabidiol reduced convulsive seizures (but not non-convulsive seizures), and resulted in more side effects compared with placebo.\n\nThree phase 3 clinical trials completed in 2017 demonstrated the efficacy of cannabidiol in reducing convulsive seizure activity at doses of 10–20 mg/kg per day in children with treatment-resistant Dravet Syndrome and treatment-resistant Lennox-Gastaut Syndrome.\n\nDue to the anecdotal nature of the health claims being made medical bodies have published statements of concern.\n\nA position statement by the American Epilepsy Society states:\n\nThe recent anecdotal reports of positive effects of the marijuana derivative cannabidiol for some individuals with treatment-resistant epilepsy give reason for hope. However, we must remember that these are only anecdotal reports, and robust scientific evidence for the use of marijuana is lacking... at present, the epilepsy community does not know if marijuana is a safe and effective treatment, nor do they know the long-term effects that marijuana will have on learning, memory and behavior, especially in infants and young children.\n\nCannabis-derived products are not mentioned in the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence epilepsy treatment guidelines.\n\nCharlotte's Web was developed in 2011 by the Stanley brothers (Joel, Jesse, Jon, Jordan, Jared and Josh) through crossbreeding a strain of marijuana with industrial hemp. This process created a variety with less tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) and more cannabidiol (CBD) than typical varieties of marijuana. The variety shows potential for medical usage, especially for those who do not wish to experience the typical high of recreational marijuana use. As it is so low in THC, the variety was originally called \"Hippie's Disappointment\", and also has been labeled \"boring\". It is a less profitable plant with \"close to no value to traditional marijuana consumers.\"\n\nThe Stanley brothers grow the plants at their farm and greenhouses. A CBD rich oil is extracted from the harvested plants and concentrated through rotary evaporation. To make it easier to perform clinical trials, they are planning to move the Charlotte's Web part of their operation to Uruguay. By doing so, they will also be able to import it into any U.S. state as hemp.\n\nThe Realm of Caring Foundation (RoC), a 501(c)(3) nonprofit organization, was set up by the Stanley brothers to help patients \"who can't afford the treatment.\" They have also started \"Stanley Brothers Social Enterprises, Inc.\", which has registered the trademark \"Charlotte's Web Hemp Products\". Some products are marketed through CW Hemp (formerly CW Botanicals).\n\nWith the main ingredient being classified as \"industrial hemp\", (Farm Bill) Charlotte's Web Oil and other CBD products are legal in all 50 states;\n(as long as the THC content is <0.3%) as they are dietary supplements. \n\nThe publicity associated with Charlotte's Web has inspired a number of legislative bills, some of which are in the planning stages, and others which have been proposed or actually passed. Children, as \"uniquely powerful advocates for medicinal pot across the country,\" have inspired \"the movement to legalize medicinal marijuana,\" a movement which \"has a face like Charlotte’s–and it’s a young one that’s hard to ignore. Lawmakers across the country are pushing legislation to legalize marijuana oil as a treatment for children with epilepsy.\"\n\nColorado law permits the use of medical cannabis for eight conditions: cancer, glaucoma, HIV/AIDS, muscle spasms, seizures, severe pain, severe nausea and dramatic weight loss, and muscle atrophy. The publicity surrounding anecdotal reports of successful treatment of intractable epilepsy with cannabinoids is likely to lead to a surge in interest.\n\nIn 2013, the parents of a two-year-old with Dravet syndrome confronted New Jersey governor Chris Christie, who signed a bill allowing access for sick children to medical marijuana in a controversy dubbed \"pot for tots\".\n\nIn 2014, legislative proposals in Utah, Arizona, New York, Washington state, Minnesota, and Florida were considered, where \"even some staunch opponents of medical marijuana now are willing to make an exception\" to allow the marijuana extract for medical treatment.\n\nIn Utah, Rep. Gage Froerer, R-Huntsville, said in October 2013: \"Nothing in federal or state law prohibits the sale or use of hemp products.\" He pledged to consult with the Utah Substance Abuse Authority, saying: \"We need to take a strong look at this and make sure that we as a legislature and we as citizens understand really what this is and what it's not.\" In November 2013, he said he would address \"three components in sponsoring legislation: access, quality control and research. He said the Utah Department of Health would probably be involved in quality-control efforts...\" Annette Maughan, President of the Epilepsy Association of Utah, said: \"The current Utah law doesn't exclude its use but also doesn't allow for its use. We are in limbo until Utah lawmakers decide what to call it.\" On March 21, 2014, Gary Herbert, the governor of Utah, signed a bill giving \"families access to the marijuana extract for treating epilepsy.\" The state bill, HB0105, allows import of Charlotte's Web extract across state lines from Colorado to Utah, and covers only use for intractable epilepsy with the consent of a neurologist. Also on March 21, 2014, an Arizona court found \"that Arizona's medical marijuana law allows consumption of the plant in extract form.\"\n\nOn March 20, 2014, the Florida House of Representatives Budget Committee passed the \"so-called Charlotte's Web measure (CS/HB 843)\" designed to limit prosecutors' ability to prosecute those in possession of low THC/high CBD marijuana (\"0.5 percent or less of tetrahydrocannabinol and more than 15 percent of cannabidiol\") used for treating seizures. The law took effect July 1, 2014. Since then, Florida legislators have passed a bill with bipartisan support legalizing the use of Charlotte's Web, and Governor Rick Scott signed the \"Compassionate Medical Cannabis Act of 2014\" (SB 1030) into law on June 6, 2014. The law is also referred to as the \"Charlotte's Web\" law. The law specifies the number of distribution centers, which types of nurseries can grow the plants, requires various other controls, and provides funding for research.\n\n\nOn October 31, 2017, the FDA sent warning letters to four CBD marketers, including Stanley Brothers Social Enterprises, LLC (d/b/a CW Hemp), the producer of Charlotte's Web. They were warned \"against making medical claims about cannabidiol (CBD). The agency also took issue with the businesses marketing CBD products as dietary supplements\".\n\nThe federal Schedule 1 drug classification blocks broad scientific research on cannabis. However, in late 2015, the United States Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) eased some regulatory requirements imposed by the Controlled Substances Act (CSA) for those who are conducting FDA-approved clinical trials on cannabidiol (CBD). These modifications will streamline the research process regarding CBD’s possible medicinal value and help foster ongoing scientific studies.\n\nBut the Marijuana Policy Project has expressed frustration over the fact that many legislative efforts inspired by Charlotte's Web are aimed at only legalizing low or no THC, high CBD medical marijuana products. They believe that such legislation is too restrictive and ignores claimed benefits of THC, leaving \"behind around 98% of the individuals who can benefit from it.\" Referring to the \"Charlotte’s Web Medical Hemp Act of 2014\", an editorial in \"Ladybud Magazine\" expressed concern that the law \"leaves thousands of patients out in the cold without safe, legal access to medical cannabis. It also ignores science that seems to indicate that whole plant medicine is optimal.\"\n\nCharlotte's Web is named after an American girl, Charlotte Figi. She developed Dravet syndrome (also known as severe myoclonic epilepsy of infancy or SMEI) as a baby. By age three, Figi was severely disabled and having 300 grand mal seizures a week despite treatment. Her parents learned about another child with Dravet Syndrome, who had been using a different type of medical marijuana since June 2011, and decided to try marijuana. Her parents and physicians said that she improved immediately. She now follows a regular regimen that uses a solution of the high-CBD marijuana extract in olive oil. She is given the oil under her tongue or in her food. Her parents said in 2013 that her epilepsy had improved so that she had only about four seizures per month, and she was able to engage in normal childhood activities.\n\nThe type now named after Figi was not the first type her parents tried. As their original supply, a type called R4 that is also high in CBD and low in THC, was running out, they contacted the Stanley brothers. From the Stanleys' stock, they chose the high-CBD variety that has since been renamed to Charlotte's Web.\n\nCharlotte's story has been featured on two CNN documentaries, \"The Doctors\" TV show, \"60 Minutes\" Australia, and \"Dateline NBC\", among many other sources. An article in the \"National Journal\" detailing the role of several children as \"uniquely powerful advocates for medicinal pot across the country\" described Charlotte as the \"first poster child for the issue...\" Her story has led to her being described as \"the girl who is changing medical marijuana laws across America,\" as well as the \"most famous example of medicinal hemp use\".\n\nWhen Charlotte was five years old, her story was featured in the August 11, 2013 CNN documentary \"Weed\", hosted by Sanjay Gupta. On November 24, 2013, Paige Figi was a guest on \"The Doctors\" TV show, where Charlotte's story was told. She was also featured in Gupta's March 11, 2014 CNN documentary \"Weed 2: Cannabis Madness\". The extract received more publicity on October 6, 2014, when \"The Doctors\" TV show again featured a story about usage of Charlotte's Web. The physicians called for a change of the Federal classification. Sanjay Gupta has also expressed his support for Charlotte's Web on \"The Doctors\" TV show. On the October 17, 2014 episode of the ABC TV series \"The View\", Paige Figi and Joel Stanley were interviewed by Whoopi Goldberg and Nicolle Wallace.\n\nThe CNN documentaries received widespread publicity and popularized Charlotte's Web as a possible treatment for epilepsy and other conditions. Colorado has legalized both the medicinal and recreational use of marijuana, and many parents have flocked there with their suffering children in search of Charlotte's Web and other forms of medical marijuana. In November 2013, CBS Denver reported that \"[t]here is now a growing community of 93 families with epileptic children using marijuana daily. Hundreds are on a waiting list and thousands are calling.\" In October 2014, \"Time\" noted the Stanley brothers had a waiting list of \"more than 12,000 families.\" They have been termed \"marijuana refugees\", \"part of a migration of families uprooting their lives and moving to Colorado, where the medicinal use of marijuana is permitted...forced to flee states where cannabis is off limits.\" In November 2014, David Nutt mentioned Charlotte's Web in the Royal Pharmaceutical Society's \"Pharmaceutical Journal\", where he appealed for \"the UK government [to] acts on evidence, allowing the use of medicinal cannabis and reducing barriers to its research.\"\n\nFamilies who say they have run out of pharmaceutical options have moved to Colorado to access Charlotte's Web. The demand has spurred calls for more research to determine whether these products actually do what is claimed. Amy Brooks-Kayal, vice president of the American Epilepsy Society, stated that epileptic seizures may come and go without any obvious explanation, and that Charlotte's web could cause developmental harm. She recommended that parents relocate so that their affected children could have access to one of the nation's top pediatric epilepsy centers rather than move to Colorado.\n\nThe product has been described as the \"country's most famous brand of CBD oil\", the \"largest selling CBD oil in the country\", and the \"number one brand\", with 7% of the market.\n\nIn November 2013, Josh Stanley said that Charlotte's web was 0.5% THC and 17% CBD, and that it \"is as legal as other hemp products already sold in stores across Utah, including other oils, clothing and hand creams, but is illegal, federally, to take across state lines.\" The legalities of selling the product to people who transport it across state lines is complicated, with difficulties for both the sellers and transporters. Regardless of state laws in Colorado and Utah which would allow the practice, it is still a Federal offense to transport hemp products across state lines. In September 2014, the content was measured at 0.3% THC.\n\nOn August 30, 2018, Charlotte's Web Holdings, Inc. (formerly Stanley Brothers Holdings Inc.) began its launch into the stock market with an initial public offering in Canada: \"The offering included a treasury issuance by the company of common shares…moreover, a secondary offering of Common Shares…for total gross proceeds of C$115,115,000 (USD 87,598,872).\"<ref name=\"Somerset_9/9/2018\"></ref>\n\nThe relationship between the Schedule I status of cannabis in the United States and the lack of scientific research on cannabis has been claimed by some to be directly related. The situation has been described as a \"catch-22\" paradox: \"Marijuana is restricted in large part because there is little research to support medical uses; research is difficult to conduct because of tight restrictions.\" Sanjay Gupta has described the complex interaction between restrictive laws and lack of scientific research:\n\nGupta repeated throughout the evening that the \"policy has outpaced the science.\" The states, he said, \"are moving forward without waiting for the science, and the issue is only compounded by the fact that the 'policies and the laws we have in [the US] make it challenging for the science to get done.\"\n\nEven though the Florida \"Compassionate Medical Cannabis Act of 2014\" (SB 1030) provides funding for research, the status of all cannabis products as illegal Schedule I drugs has limited the amount of research, with the University of Florida refusing to do such research for fear of losing federal funding.\n\nThe interest created by the documentary highlighted a need for increased scientific research, as well as caution against \"bad medicine\" and raising false hopes: Ed Maa, a specialist in epilepsy, stated: \"This is not going away. ...I think it needs to be studied vigorously and very quickly.\" He hopes to \"launch a clinical trial to study the pot and its potential.\" Physicians have called for more research to better understand the potential benefits of controlled use of medical marijuana; Sharon Levy, director of the Adolescent Substance Abuse Program at Children's Hospital Boston said:\n\"The AAP strongly supports more cannabinoid research to better understand both how these substances can be used therapeutically as well as their potential side effects—which we may well be underestimating...[But] the AAP does not support 'medical marijuana' laws as they circumvent regulations put in place to protect patients, and children are a particularly vulnerable population.\"\n\nPhysicians have expressed both positive interest and worry about the sudden explosion of interest in the legalization of medical marijuana and its research, admitting legalization is both \"a scientist's dream or a doctor's nightmare.\" They fear that some parents are too open to trying anything before proper research has been conducted, and that they may be disappointed. They are \"alarmed by parallels to past miracle-cure manias later proved false...\" and \"...wary of the heightened placebo effect in treatments involving children, when reports of progress depend on the view of parents.\" There is also danger that \"the [legalization] movement also opens the way for bad medicine...through treatments at best giving hope to the hysterical and at worst delivering damaging side effects.\" According to Alan Shackelford, Charlotte Figi's physician: \"We really don't know how it works... The cannabidiol seems to act as a neuro-stabilizer, but how? The research is minuscule on this.\"\n\nOrrin Devinsky, a neurologist at New York University's Comprehensive Epilepsy Center, where he will conduct clinical trials on Epidiolex, a high-CBD drug from GW Pharmaceuticals, expressed his sympathy for those who do not want to wait for research results:\n\nHe also expressed concern that the number of parents using the Charlotte's Web extract will make it harder to find children for the clinical trials, and that:\n\nThere are many more unknowns than knowns...the focus of the community—lay and scientific and governmental—should be on getting good information. That should be the real focus of what we need right now.\n\nThe Epilepsy Foundation and Devinsky issued a joint statement calling for increased research and immediate access to medical marijuana, specifically naming Charlotte Figi's case. Devinsky said:\n\nWe need to make a balanced decision about compassionate use. If I were Charlotte Figi's parents and lived in Colorado I would have done exactly what they did. And as a doctor, I would gladly prescribe marijuana products for many of my patients who failed existing therapies if it were legal in my state. ... Until we have the scientific data, we should make medical marijuana available to physicians who care for people with treatment-resistant epilepsy and their patients.\n\nDue to reports that some people with Dravet syndrome seem to benefit from treatment with Charlotte's Web, an observational clinical trial was launched in September 2014 at the University of Colorado. The study will run until February 2016, will focus on genetic differences between people who respond and do not respond, and attempt to determine if such genetic factors may be related to the success or failure of treatment.\n\nIn January 2018, it was reported that trials with Epidiolex, a high-CBD pharmaceutical, had been successful enough that it might be \"available as soon as the second half of 2018 in the United States, pending Food and Drug Administration approval.\"<ref name=\"Cha_1/24/2018\"></ref>\n\n"}

Chesil Beach itself is one of three major shingle structures in Britain, extending from West Bay to the Isle of Portland, the latter acting as a large groyne holding the beach in place. It also provides shelter from the prevailing winds and waves for the town of Weymouth and the village of Chiswell.\n\nThe adjoining village of Chiswell was established predominately as a fishing community. Despite its vulnerability to sea storms and flooding, Chiswell continued to develop into a thriving community. One of the best-documented incidents of flooding occurred in the Great Storm of 1824. The storm saw the death of thirty residents, the destruction of eighty houses, and the damage of many others. The construction of a sea wall finally commenced in 1958, and work on this scheme continued until 1965. The wall extended from the far end of Chesil Cove, at West Weares, to the location of the village's Cove House Inn. A promenade was laid-out on top of the wall, and this became a popular attraction.\n\nDespite the sea wall proving a worthy defence, incidents of widespread flooding continue. During December 1978 and February 1979, two major storms caused further devastation to Chiswell. Accordingly, further defence were installated during the 1980s. During January–February 2014, violent storms across the south-west of England caused more flooding in the village.\n\nThe Jurassic Coast stretches over a distance of , from Orcombe Point near Exmouth, in the west, to Old Harry Rocks on the Isle of Purbeck, in the east. The coastal exposures along the coastline provide a continuous sequence of Triassic, Jurassic and Cretaceous rock formations spanning approximately 185 million years of the Earth's history. The localities along the Jurassic Coast includes a large range of important fossil zones.\n\nChesil Cove is a popular site for scuba divers. It has become one of the best known shore dives in the UK. The cove is a reasonably shallow shore dive, and has an interesting selection of south coast marine life, as well as an abundance of flora and fauna. Although there have been many shipwrecks in the cove, few significant divable remains exist close to the beach due to its exposure to strong waves.\n\nThrough fishing, the beach provided the main occupation for the villagers of Chiswell and the rest of the islanders. The beach is still used by sea anglers and the British record for shore-captured shore rockling was set there in 1992. Recreational fishing is a popular pastime at the cove.\n\nChesil Beach, and the cove, have seen many cases of shipwrecks, more so than most other parts of the British coast, particularly during the age of sail. Chesil Beach became infamously known as \"Deadman's Bay\", taken after the name Thomas Hardy gave West Bay, including Chesil Cove, in his novel \"The Well Beloved\" of 1892.\n\nThe local fishermen, particularly at Portland, developed a purpose-built vessel to withstand the sea actions at Chesil Beach. The boat, known as a Lerret, is a double-ended open fishing boat, used for seine net fishing. The 18th-century public house The Cove House Inn remains one of Portland's most popular pubs and is Grade II Listed. Despite its particularly vulnerable position on the beach, the pub was a survivor of the Great Storm of 1824.\n\nSome of the ships wrecked at Chesil Cove include:\n\n\n"}

{"id": "25066324", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=25066324", "title": "Design for All (in ICT)", "text": "Design for All (in ICT)\n\nDesign for All in the context of information and communications technology (ICT) is the conscious and systematic effort to proactively apply principles, methods and tools to promote universal design in computer-related technologies, including Internet-based technologies, thus avoiding the need for \"a posteriori\" adaptations, or specialised design (Stephanidis et al., 2001).\n\nDesign for All is design for human diversity, social inclusion and equality. It should not be conceived of as an effort to advance a single solution for everybody, but as a user-centred approach to providing products that can automatically address the possible range of human abilities, skills, requirements, and preferences. Consequently, the outcome of the design process is not intended to be a singular design, but a design space populated with appropriate alternatives, together with the rationale underlying each alternative, that is, the specific user and usage context characteristics for which each alternative has been designed.\n\nTraditionally, accessibility problems have been solved with adaptations and the use of assistive technology products has been a technical approach to obtain adaptations. Universal Access implies the accessibility and usability of information and telecommunications technologies by anyone at any place and at any time and their inclusion in any living context. It aims to enable equitable access and active participation of potentially all people in existing and emerging computer-mediated human activities, by developing universally accessible and usable products and services and suitable support functionalities in the environment. These products and services must be capable of accommodating individual user requirements in different contexts of use, independent of location, target machine, or runtime environment. Therefore, the approach aiming to grant the use of equipment or services is generalized, seeking to give access to the Information Society as such. Citizens are supposed to live in environments populated with intelligent objects, where the tasks to be performed and the way of performing them are completely redefined, involving a combination of activities of access to information, interpersonal communication, and environmental control. Citizens must be given the possibility of carrying them out easily and pleasantly.\n\nFor a thorough discussion of the challenges and benefits of Design for All in the context of ICT, see also the EDeAN White Paper (2005) and the \"Report on the impact of technological developments on eAccessibility\" of the DfA@eInclusion project.\n\nThe European Commission Communication on e-Accessibility, identified a core of practical challenges, as well as market, legal and policy issues towards improving eAccessibility and e-Inclusion in Europe, and elaborated a three-fold approach based on:\n\nIn that respect, the challenges that need to be addressed include:\n\nThe present policy context of accessibility in the Information Society in Europe is the i2010 initiative. The \"i2010 – A European Information Society for growth and employment\" initiative was launched by the European Commission as a framework for addressing the main challenges and developments in the information society and media sectors up to 2010. It promotes an open and competitive digital economy and emphasises ICT as a driver of inclusion and quality of life. The initiative contains a range of EU policy instruments to encourage the development of the digital economy, such as regulatory instruments, research and partnerships with stakeholders.\n\nThe goal of the European Union Disability Strategy is a society that is open and accessible to all. The barriers need to be identified and removed. The European Union Disability Strategy has three main focuses: co-operation between the Commission and the Member States, full participation of people with disabilities, and mainstreaming disability in policy formulation.\nNon-discrimination is also one of the general principles of the \"Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities\", adopted by the United Nations General Assembly on 13 December 2006 and was opened for signatures on 30 March 2007.\n\nThere is a long tradition of European legislation with regard to telecommunications. In 2002, the European Union adopted a new regulatory framework for electronic communications networks and services, covering all forms of fixed and wireless telecoms, data transmission and broadcasting. From a Design for All perspective, the most important Directives are the Directive on a common regulatory framework and the Directive on universal service and users' rights relating to electronic communications networks and services (Universal Service Directive).\n\nPublic procurement is an important economic force, and therefore it is an important tool to promote accessibility. The legislative package of public procurement Directives, approved in 2004 by the European Parliament and the EU's Council of Ministers, will help simplify and modernize procurement procedures.\n\nThe new directives make it possible to take accessibility needs into account at several stages of a procurement process.\nIt is most convenient to refer to standards when making technical specifications. There are already many CEN, ETSI and ITU standards which can be used for this purpose and many sources which can be useful in practice. Likewise, guidelines like the WAI guidelines, for example, or national guidelines have been used.\nIn the future it will be easier to find suitable standards. Mandate M/376<ref name=\"M/376\">European Commission Enterprise and Industry Directorate-General (2005): Standardisation Mandate to CEN, CENELEC, and ETSI in support of European accessibility requirements for public procurement of products and services in the ICT domain, Accessed 2009-10-09.</ref> has been given by the European Commission to the European Standardisation Organisations CEN, CENELEC and ETSI, to come up with a solution for common requirements and conformance assessment.\n\nNot all products are accessible for persons with disabilities. When producing audio books, or certain other accessible works, an additional copy is created, and copyright can be a problem in this situation. On the other hand, copyright is an essential part of the sustainability of a creative society. This conflict of interests must be solved somehow in order to ensure the Information Society is a Society for All. There is international and European legislation in this field. The objectives of the Directive on the harmonisation of certain aspects of copyright and related rights in the information society are to adapt legislation on copyright and related rights to reflect technological developments and to transpose into Community law the main international obligations arising from the two treaties on copyright and related rights adopted within the framework of the World Intellectual Property Organisation (WIPO) in December 1996.\n\nThe relationship between design and privacy is not necessarily obvious. Modern technology, which is a result of design, is able to collect significant amounts of personal information. The user has an interest in that information being correct and in it being used appropriately. The person may want to keep something confidential and have access to the information that has been collected. In other words, privacy is desired.\nIn 1995 the European Union adopted a Directive on the processing of personal data.\n\nThis directive established the basic principles for the collection, storage and use of personal data which should be respected by governments, businesses and any other organizations or individuals engaged in handling personal data.\nWithin the context of Design for All (in ICT), privacy protection is called Privacy by Design.\n\nIn the US, Australia, Japan and in the European Union more and more legislative actions are put in place to require public bodies and companies to make sure that their products and services are accessible and usable not only by “standard” users but also by others such as elderly persons or people with an impairment. As it would be unwise to write down technical – and therefore time-bound – requirements into a law, legislative texts preferably refer to (international) standards.\n\nStandardisation, i.e., in very general terms, producing a \"standard\" (French: ; German: ; Spanish:\n) is a voluntary action set up in the past, almost uniquely, by commercial partners who believe that the standardisation will permit easier exchanges of products and goods. This implied very often that the acceptance of the standards is also voluntary and triggered by expected commercial benefits. Only to a very limited extent consumer representatives did participate in standardisation.\nOn the other hand, laws in many countries are referring more and more to the required acceptance of several standards (e.g. on safety or on ecological aspects). The net result of this need for standards is that nowadays many standardisation initiatives are stimulated (= subsidised) by public bodies or, in Europe, directly and indirectly by the European Commission. Also many guidelines have been created by stakeholder groups.\n\nAs DfA standardisation was explicitly mentioned in the eEurope2002 and i2010 Action Plans\nof the European Union, several new actions were established since then. Four major recent strategies can be distinguished:\n\nETSI Guide\n\"Human Factors (HF); \nGuidelines for ICT products and services; \n\"Design for All\"\".\n\n\"The Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.0\" is a technical standard that covers a wide range of recommendations for making Web content more accessible. Following these guidelines will make content accessible to a wider range of people with disabilities, including blindness and low vision, deafness and hearing loss, learning disabilities, cognitive limitations, limited movement, speech disabilities, photosensitivity and combinations of these. Following these guidelines will also often make your Web content more usable to users in general.\n\n\"\" provides guidance on how to embed accessibility concerns into organisation's policies and digital production processes. The Standard provides non-technical website owners a better understanding of the value of inclusive design, and a framework for how to use guidelines like WCAG 2.0 to help them create products which are Designed for All. The Standard's lead-author, Jonathan Hassell, has created a summary of BS 8878 to help organisations better understand how the standard can help them.\n\nThe application domains of Design for All in the context of ICT, practically include every field involving Information and Communication Technologies.\n\nThe significance of the application domains reflects their role in establishing a coherent and socially acceptable Information Society, but also the diverse range of human activities affected.\nThe critical application domains for Design for All, can be summarised as follows:\n\nThe White Paper \"Toward an Information Society for All: An International R&D Agenda\" (1998) published by the International Scientific Forum \"Towards an Information Society for All\" (ISF-IS4ALL), has discussed the significance of these application domains:\n\nOne major lever to improve awareness and practice in Design for All is the development of education and training programs. Professionals are needed who have acquired comprehensive specialist knowledge and skills in Design for All; in addition those professionals who currently work in ICT industry need to acquire additional knowledge and skills concerning Design for All.\n\nLittle evidence can be found of university degree programmes that specialize in Design for All (or Universal Design) or that explicitly includes a module about this. This lack was tackled in the project DfA@eInclusion, which devised curricula:\nThe implementation of such programmes is already under way in a few places, for example at Oslo and Akershus University College of Applied Sciences, the Middlesex University, UK, University of Linz, Austria and the University of Trás-os-Montes e Alto Douro, Portugal. Core topics include an understanding of the principles of human rights, the development of standards, regulations and legislation, the design and development of assistive technologies as well as improved access of mainstream products and services.\n\nWeb accessibility is an important component of accessing the information society and information and guidance is offered by the World Wide Web Consortium's Web Accessibility Initiative (WAI) as well as online tutorials (for example, Opera's Web Standards Curriculum).\n\nThe complementary approach of training for professionals in ICT industry has also been tackled by the DfA@eInclusion project.\nA comprehensive curriculum for such trainings has been recommended and is currently subject to a CEN workshop negotiation. The CEN workshop \"Curriculum for training professionals in Universal Design (UD-Prof)\" has been implemented in May 2009. Following the general rules for CEN workshops, it offers all interested stakeholders an opportunity to discuss and improve this DfA curriculum for ICT professionals.\n\n\nThe European Design for All e-Accessibility Network - EDeAN is a network of 160 organisations in European Union member states. The goal of the network is to support all citizens' access to the Information Society. EDeAN provides:\nThe network is coordinated by the EDeAN Secretariat, which rotates annually and the corresponding National Contact Centres which are the contact points for EDeAN in each EU member state.\n\nEIDD - Design for All Europe is a 100% self-financed European organisation that covers the entire area of theory and practice of Design for All, from the built environment and tangible products to communication, service and system design. Originally set up in 1993 as the European Institute for Design and Disability (EIDD),to enhance the quality of life through Design for All, it changed its name in 2006 to bring it into line with its core business. EIDD - Design for All Europe disseminates the application of Design for All to business and administration communities previously unaware of its benefits and currently (2009) has active member organisations in 22 European countries. The aim of EIDD is to encourage active interaction and communication between professionals interested in the theory and practice of Design for All and to build bridges between, on the one hand, these and other members of the design community and, on the other hand, all those other communities where Design for All can make a real difference to the quality of life for everyone.\n\nThis is a support project to EDeAN. The project aims to develop an exemplary training course for Design for all targeted to the Industry, course structures and curricula for studying Design for All in undergraduate and postgraduate levels as well as an online knowledge base on Design for All.\n\nThe project aims to develop an adaptable web browser interface for people with reduced cognitive skills, which can be used at home and at work.\n\nThe project seeks to develop a universal remote console that will allow networked access to everyday appliances in the home.\n\nThis project is developing scalable and adaptive ‘add-ons’ which will allow assistive technologies to be integrated into intelligent ICTs for the home.\n\nThis project is looking at the next generation of assistive devices which will help hearing-impaired people to participate fully in the Information Society.\n\nCogKnow aims to develop and prototype a cognitive prosthetic device to help those struggling with dementia to perform their daily activities.\n\nThe project seeks to mainstream the accessibility of consumer goods and services. The aim is to develop technology platforms that allow elderly and disabled people to continue living in their own homes and stay in their communities.\n\nThe project aims to train end-users in standardisation related issues and to enable them to participate in standardisation activities in the area of ICT.\n\nThe project aims at creating modeling and simulation supporting tools to optimize user interaction design and accessibility and usability validation process when developing Ambient Assisted Living solutions.\n\nThe project aims at further develop Ambient Assisted Living products and services that are affordable, easy to use and commercially viable. The project develops an integrated technological platform that seamlessly links up the different products and services for social inclusion, for support in daily life activities, for early risk detection, for personal protection from health and environmental risks, for support in mobility and displacements within his neighbourhood/town, all of which make a life of freedom worth living within their families and within the society.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "20517231", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=20517231", "title": "Dogmatic school", "text": "Dogmatic school\n\nThe Dogmatic school of medicine (\"Dogmatics\", or \"Dogmatici\", ) was a school of medicine in ancient Greece and Rome. They were the oldest of the medical sects of antiquity. They derived their name from \"dogma\", a philosophical tenet or opinion, because they professed to follow the opinions of Hippocrates, hence they were sometimes called \"Hippocratici\". Thessalus, the son, and Polybus, the son-in-law of Hippocrates, were the founders of this sect, c. 400 BC, which enjoyed great reputation, and held undisputed sway over the whole medical profession, until the establishment of the Alexandrian school known as the Empiric school. After the rise of Empiric school, for some centuries, every physician counted himself under either one or the other of the two parties. The most distinguished among this school were Diocles of Carystus, Praxagoras of Cos, and Plistonicus. The doctrines of this school are described by Aulus Cornelius Celsus in the introduction to his \"De Medicina\".\n\nThe Dogmatic school held that it was necessary to be acquainted with the \"hidden causes\" of diseases, as well as the \"more evident causes\", and to know how the \"natural actions and different functions\" of the human body take place, which necessarily assumes a knowledge of the \"interior parts\".\n\nThey gave the name of \"hidden causes\" to those things which concern the elements or principles of which our bodies are composed, and the occasion of good or ill health. It is impossible, they said, for people to know how to set about curing an illness unless they know what it comes from; since there is no doubt that they must treat it in one way, if diseases in general proceed from the excess or deficiency of one of the four elements, as some philosophers supposed; in another way, if all the malady lies in the humours of the body, as Herophilus thought; in another, if it is to be attributed to the respiration, according to the idea of Hippocrates (perhaps alluding to the \"De Flatibus\", which is generally considered spurious); in another, if the blood excites inflammation by passing from the veins which are meant to contain it into the vessels that ought only to contain air, and if this inflammation produces the extraordinary movement of the blood that is remarked in fever, according to the opinion of Erasistratus; and in another, if it is by means of corpuscles which stop in the invisible passages and block up the way, as Asclepiades affirms to be the case. If this be granted, it must necessarily appear that, of all physicians, he will succeed the best in the cure of diseased who understands best their first origin and cause.\n\nThe Dogmatic school did not deny the necessity of experiments; but they said that these experiments could not be made, and never had been made, but by reasoning. They added, that it is probable that the first people who applied themselves to medicine, did not recommend to their patients the first thing that came into their thoughts, but that they deliberated about it, and that experiment and use then let them know if they had reasoned justly or not. It mattered little, they said, that people declared that the greater number of remedies had been the subject of experiment from the first, provided they confessed that these experiments were the results of the reasoning of those who tried the remedies. They went on to say, that we often see new sorts of diseases break out, for which neither experiment nor custom has yet found out any cure; and that, therefore, it is necessary to observe where they came from and how they first began, for otherwise no one can tell why, in such an emergency, one should makes use of one remedy rather than another. Such are the reasons why a physician ought to try to discover the \"hidden causes\" of diseases.\n\nAs for the \"evident causes\", which are such as can easily be discovered by anybody, and where one has only to know if the illness proceeds from heat or from cold, from having eaten too little or too much, etc., they said it was necessary to inform one's self of all of that, make on it the suitable reflections; but they did not think that one ought to stop there without going any further.\n\nThey said also, in regard to the \"natural actions\", that it was necessary to know wherefore and in what manner we receive the air into our lungs, and why we afterward expire it; why food is taken into the body, how it is there prepared, and then distributed through every part of it; why the arteries are subject to pulsation; what is the cause of sleep, wakefulness, etc.; and they maintained that people could not cure diseases relating to these many functions unless they were able to explain these phenomena.\n\nLastly, they maintained that as the principal pains and diseases proceed from the \"internal parts\", it is impossible for people to administer any remedy unless they are acquainted with these parts. They therefore thought that it was necessary to dissect dead bodies, for it was not possible to treat sick organs if one did not understand the nature of healthy organs.\n\n\n\n"}

Examples of such legacy methods include:\neMix was one of the first cloud-based systems for accomplishing these tasks.\n\nCloud-based services are likely to help facilitate the trend toward universal access to medical imaging and other electronic medical information. For example, members of health information exchanges (HIEs) can use a service such as eMix to share radiology data even when those members have mutually incompatible IT systems. The service also makes it possible for a healthcare institution to include radiology data obtained from out-of-network facilities or physicians in the institution's PACS, radiology information system (RIS), healthcare information system (HIS), or electronic medical record (EMR). Finally, it is a logical system for patients to use when adding medical imaging information to their personal health record (PHR).\n\nA potential advantage of using a cloud-based system is affordability. Healthcare institutions, physician offices, and patients need no special infrastracture to use such a system—they only need a computer connected via broadband to the Internet. They don't need to acquire special hardware or software, and can pay for the service on a subscription basis, much like phone service.\n\nThe cloud-based service is a business venture of DR Systems, an independent provider of enterprise imaging and information management systems for hospitals, integrated healthcare networks and diagnostic imaging centers,\neMix debuted in beta phase in late 2009. During this period, it was successfully tested by three medical facilities in Montana on behalf of Image Movement of Montana, an organization of 30 medical institutions in Montana that formed to seek more efficient ways of sharing medical imaging data, The three IMOM members implemented eMix on a clinical basis in December 2009, becoming the first facilities in the nation to exchange data with the system, Other IMOM facilities have since tested and implemented eMix, as well.\neMix was launched as a commercially available product in early 2010. Besides the IMOM facilities, eMix is currently being used by healthcare providers in Florida, California, Texas, Washington, Alaska, Tennessee, Arkansas, and South Dakota.\nEuropean eMix service is scheduled to debut in European countries in the Fall of 2010.\n\nDR System's Chairman of the Board is Murray Reicher, M.D., a board-certified diagnostic radiologist and company co-founder.

{"id": "493567", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=493567", "title": "Epididymitis", "text": "Epididymitis\n\nEpididymitis is a medical condition characterized by inflammation of the epididymis, a curved structure at the back of the testicle. Onset of pain is typically over a day or two. The pain may improve with raising the testicle. Other symptoms may include swelling of the testicle, burning with urination, or frequent urination. Inflammation of the testicle is commonly also present.\nIn those who are young and sexually active gonorrhea and chlamydia are frequently the underlying cause. In older males and males who have sex with males enteric bacteria are common. Diagnosis is typically based on symptoms. Conditions that may result in similar symptoms include testicular torsion, inguinal hernia, and testicular cancer. Ultrasound can be useful if the diagnosis is unclear.\nTreatment may include pain medications, NSAIDs, and elevation. Recommended antibiotics in those who are young and sexually active are ceftriaxone and doxycycline. Among those who are older ofloxacin may be used. Complications include infertility and chronic pain. Those ages 15 to 35 are most commonly affected with about 600,000 people within this age group affected per year in the United States.\n\nThose ages 15 to 35 are most commonly affected. The acute form usually develops over the course of several days, with pain and swelling frequently in only one testis, which will hang low in the scrotum. There will often be a recent history of dysuria or urethral discharge. Fever is also a common symptom. In the chronic version, the patient may have painful point tenderness but may or may not have an irregular epididymis upon palpation, though palpation may reveal an indurated epididymis. A scrotal ultrasound may reveal problems with the epididymis, but such an ultrasound may also show nothing unusual. The majority of patients who present with chronic epididymitis have had symptoms for over five years.\nUntreated, acute epididymitis's major complications are abscess formation and testicular infarction. Chronic epididymitis can lead to permanent damage or even destruction of the epididymis and testicle (resulting in infertility and/or hypogonadism), and infection may spread to any other organ or system of the body. Chronic pain is also an associated complication for untreated chronic epididymitis.\n\nThough urinary tract infections in men are rare, bacterial infection is the most common cause of acute epididymitis. The bacteria in the urethra back-track through the urinary and reproductive structures to the epididymis. In rare circumstances, the infection reaches the epididymis via the bloodstream.\n\nIn sexually active men, \"Chlamydia trachomatis\" is responsible for two-thirds of acute cases, followed by \"Neisseria gonorrhoeae\" and \"E. coli\" (or other bacteria that cause urinary tract infection). Particularly among men over age 35 in whom the cause is \"E. coli\", epididymitis is commonly due to urinary tract obstruction. Less common microbes include \"Ureaplasma\", Mycobacterium, and \"cytomegalovirus\", or \"Cryptococcus\" in patients with HIV infection. \"E. coli\" is more common in boys before puberty, the elderly, and men who have sex with men. In the majority of cases in which bacteria are the cause, only one side of the scrotum or the other is the locus of pain.\n\nNon-infectious causes are also possible. Reflux of sterile urine (urine without bacteria) through the ejaculatory ducts may cause inflammation with obstruction. In children, it may be a response following an infection with enterovirus, adenovirus or \"Mycoplasma pneumoniae\". Rare non-infectious causes of chronic epididymitis include sarcoidosis (more prevalent in black men) and Behçet's disease.\n\nAny form of epididymitis can be caused by genito-urinary surgery, including prostatectomy and urinary catheterization. Congestive epididymitis is a long-term complication of vasectomy. Chemical epididymitis may also result from drugs such as amiodarone.\n\nDiagnosis is typically based on symptoms. Conditions that may result in similar symptoms include testicular torsion, inguinal hernia, and testicular cancer. Ultrasound can be useful if the diagnosis is unclear.\n\nEpididymitis usually has a gradual onset. Typical findings are redness, warmth and swelling of the scrotum, with tenderness behind the testicle, away from the middle (this is the normal position of the epididymis relative to the testicle). The cremasteric reflex (elevation of the testicle in response to stroking the upper inner thigh) remains normal. This is a useful sign to distinguish it from testicular torsion. If there is pain relieved by elevation of the testicle, this is called Prehn's sign, which is, however, non-specific and is not useful for diagnosis.\n\nBefore the advent of sophisticated medical imaging techniques, surgical exploration was the standard of care. Today, Doppler ultrasound is a common test: it can demonstrate areas of blood flow and can distinguish clearly between epididymitis and torsion. However, as torsion and other sources of testicular pain can often be determined by palpation alone, some studies have suggested that the only real benefit of an ultrasound is to assure the person that they do not have testicular cancer. Nuclear testicular blood flow testing is rarely used.\n\nAdditional tests may be necessary to identify underlying causes. In younger children, a urinary tract anomaly is frequently found. In sexually active men, tests for sexually transmitted diseases may be done. These may include microscopy and culture of a first void urine sample, Gram stain and culture of fluid or a swab from the urethra, nucleic acid amplification tests (to amplify and detect microbial DNA or other nucleic acids) or tests for syphilis and HIV.\n\nEpididymitis can be classified as acute, subacute, and chronic, depending on the duration of symptoms.\n\nChronic epididymitis is epididymitis that is present for more than 3 months. Chronic epididymitis is characterized by inflammation even when there is no infection present. Tests are needed to distinguish chronic epididymitis from a range of other disorders that can cause constant scrotal pain including testicular cancer (though this is often painless), enlarged scrotal veins (varicocele), calcifications, and a possible cyst within the epididymis. Some research has found that as much as 80% of visits to a urologist for scrotal pain are for chronic epididymitis. As a further complication, the nerves in the scrotal area are closely connected to those of the abdomen, sometimes causing abdominal pain similar to a hernia (see referred pain).\n\nChronic epididymitis is most commonly associated with lower back pain, and the onset of pain often co-occurs with activity that stresses the low back (i.e., heavy lifting, long periods of car driving, poor posture while sitting, or any other activity that interferes with the normal curve of the lumbar lordosis region).\n\nIn both the acute and chronic forms, antibiotics are used if an infection is suspected. The treatment of choice is often azithromycin and cefixime to cover both gonorrhoeae and chlamydia. Fluoroquinolones are no longer recommended due to widespread resistance of gonorrhoeae to this class. Doxycycline may be used as an alternative to azithromycin. In chronic epididymitis, a four- to six-week course of antibiotics may be prescribed to ensure the complete eradication of any possible bacterial cause, especially the various chlamydiae.\n\nFor cases caused by enteric organisms (such as \"E. coli\"), ofloxacin or levofloxacin are recommended.\n\nIn children, fluoroquinolones and doxycycline are best avoided. Since bacteria that cause urinary tract infections are often the cause of epididymitis in children, co-trimoxazole or suited penicillins (for example, cephalexin) can be used.\n\nHousehold remedies such as elevation of the scrotum and cold compresses applied regularly to the scrotum may relieve the pain in acute cases. Painkillers or anti-inflammatory drugs are often used for treatment of both chronic and acute forms. Hospitalisation is indicated for severe cases, and check-ups can ensure the infection has cleared up. Surgical removal of the epididymis is rarely necessary, causes sterility, and only gives relief from pain in approximately 50% of cases. However, in acute suppurating epididymitis (acute epididymitis with a discharge of pus), a epididymotomy may be recommended; in refractory cases, a full epididymectomy may be required. In cases with unrelenting testicular pain, removal of the entire testicle—orchiectomy—may also be warranted.\n\nIt is generally believed that most cases of chronic epididymitis will eventually \"burn out\" of patient's system if left untreated, though this might take years or even decades. However, some prostate-related medications have proven effective in treating chronic epididymitis, including doxazosin.\n\nEpididymitis makes up 1 in 144 visits for medical care (0.69 percent) in men 18 to 50 years old or 600,000 cases in males between 18 and 35 in the United States.\n\nIt occurs primarily in those 16 to 30 years of age and 51 to 70 years. As of 2008 there appears to be an increase in incidences in the United States that parallels an increase in reported cases of chlamydia and gonorrhea.\n\n"}

It encompasses the health care dimensions of family planning, preconception, prenatal, and postnatal care in order to ensure a positive and fulfilling experience in most cases and reduce maternal morbidity and mortality in other cases.\n\nThe United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA) estimated that 289,000 women died of pregnancy or childbirth related causes in 2013. These causes range from severe bleeding to obstructed labour, all of which have highly effective interventions. As women have gained access to family planning and skilled birth attendance with backup emergency obstetric care, the global maternal mortality ratio has fallen from 380 maternal deaths per 100,000 live births in 1990 to 210 deals per 100,000 live births in 2013. This has resulted in many countries halving their maternal death rates.\n\nWhile there has been a decline in worldwide mortality rates much more has to be done. High rates still exist particularly in impoverished communities with over 85% living in Africa and Southern Asia. The effect of a mother's death results in vulnerable families, and their infants, if they survive childbirth, are more likely to die before reaching their second birthday.\n\nBoth maternal mortality and severe maternal mortality (SMM) are \"associated with a high rate of preventability.\"\n\nIn 2010 the U.S. Joint Commission on Accreditation of Healthcare Organizations described maternal mortality as a \"sentinel event\", and uses it to assess the quality of a health care system.\n\nFour elements are essential to maternal death prevention. First, prenatal care. It is recommended that expectant mothers receive at least four antenatal visits to check and monitor the health of mother and foetus. Second, skilled birth attendance with emergency backup such as doctors, nurses and midwives who have the skills to manage normal deliveries and recognize the onset of complications. Third, emergency obstetric care to address the major causes of maternal death which are haemorrhage, sepsis, unsafe abortion, hypertensive disorders and obstructed labour. Lastly, postnatal care which is the six weeks following delivery. During this time bleeding, sepsis and hypertensive disorders can occur and newborns are extremely vulnerable in the immediate aftermath of birth. Therefore, follow-up visits by a health worker is assess the health of both mother and child in the postnatal period is strongly recommended.\n\nAccording to a UNFPA report, social and economic status, culture norms and values, and geographic remoteness increase all increases a maternal mortality, and the risk for maternal death (during pregnancy or childbirth) in sub-Saharan Africa is 175 times higher than in developed countries, and risk for pregnancy-related illnesses and negative consequences after birth is even higher. Poverty, maternal health, and outcomes for the child are all interconnected.\n\nWomen living in poverty-stricken areas are more likely to be obese and engage in unhealthy behaviors such as cigarette smoking and drug use, are less likely to engage in or even have access to legitimate prenatal care, and are at a significantly higher risk for adverse outcomes for both the mother and child. A study conducted in Kenya observed that common maternal health problems in poverty-stricken areas include hemorrhaging, anemia, hypertension, malaria, placenta retention, premature labor, prolonged/complicated labor, and pre-eclampsia.\n\nGenerally, adequate prenatal care encompasses medical care and educational, social, and nutritional services during pregnancy. Although there are a variety of reasons women choose not to engage in proper prenatal care, 71% of low-income women in a US national study had difficulties getting access to prenatal care when they sought it out. Additionally, immigrants and Hispanic women are at higher risk than white or black women for receiving little to no prenatal care, where level of education is also an indicator (since education and race are correlated). Adolescents are least likely to receive any prenatal care at all. Throughout several studies, women and adolescents ranked inadequate finances and lack of transportation as the most common barriers to receiving proper prenatal care.\n\nIncome is strongly correlated with quality of prenatal care. Sometimes, proximity to healthcare facilities and access to transportation have significant effects on whether or not women have access to prenatal care. An analysis conducted on maternal healthcare services in Mali found that women who lived in rural areas, far away from healthcare facilities were less likely to receive prenatal care than those who lived in urban areas. Furthermore, researchers found an even stronger relationship between lack of transportation and prenatal and delivery care. In addition to proximity being a predictor of prenatal care access, Materia and colleagues found similar results for proximity and antenatal care in rural Ethiopia.\n\nMaternal HIV rates vary around the world, ranging from 1% to 40%, with African and Asian countries having the highest rates. Whilst maternal HIV infection largely has health implications for the child, especially in countries where poverty is high and education levels are low, having HIV/AIDS while pregnant can also cause heightened health risks for the mother. A large concern for HIV-positive pregnant women is the risk of contracting tuberculosis (TB) and/or malaria, in developing countries.\n\nGestational weight gain should typically fall between in order to improve outcomes for both mother and child. Increased rates of hypertension, diabetes, respiratory complications, and infections are prevalent in cases of maternal obesity and can have detrimental effects on pregnancy outcomes. Obesity is an extremely strong risk factor for gestational diabetes. Research has found that obese mothers who lose weight (at least 10 pounds or 4.5 kg) in-between pregnancies reduce the risk of gestational diabetes during their next pregnancy, whereas mothers who gain weight actually increase their risk.\n\nMaternal oral health has been shown to affect the well-being of both the expectant mother and her unborn fetus.\n\nThe 2000 Surgeon's General Report stressed the interdependence of oral health on the overall health and well-being of an individual. Oral health is especially essential during perinatal period and the future development of the child. Proper management of oral health has benefits to both mother and child. Furthermore, lack of understanding or maintenance of good oral health for pregnant women may have adverse effects on them and their children. Hence, it is imperative to educate mothers regarding the significance of oral health. Moreover, collaboration and support among physicians across various fields, especially among family practitioners and obstetricians, is essential in addressing the concerns for maternal oral health. In 2007, the Maternal Oral Health Project was developed to provide routine oral care to low-income pregnant women in Nassau County, NY. Since its inception, the program has treated more than 2,000 pregnant women, many of whom had significant gum and/or tooth problems.\n\nOral health has numerous implications on overall general health and the quality of life of an individual. The \"Surgeon General's Report\" lists various systemic diseases and conditions that have oral manifestations. The oral cavity serves as both a site of and a gateway entry of disease for microbial infections, which can affect general health status. In addition, some studies have demonstrated a relationship between periodontal diseases and diabetes, cardiovascular disease, stroke, and adverse pregnancy outcomes. Furthermore, the report establishes a relationship between oral health and quality of life, including functional, psychosocial, and economic indicators. Poor oral health can affect diet, nutrition, sleep, psychological status, social interaction, school, and work.\n\nProtection and control of oral health and diseases safeguards a woman's health and quality of life before and during pregnancy. Also, it has the potential to decrease the transmission of pathogenic bacteria that occurs from mother to child. Along with pregnancy, come physiological changes for a woman. The changes, including fluctuating hormones, increase the woman's susceptibility to oral infections such as periodontal disease. This disease impairs the body's ability to repair and maintain soft tissues. It also causes indirect damage through bacterial induction of both inflammatory and immune responses of the host. During pregnancy, mild inflammation of the gums, \"pregnancy gingivitis\", is quite common and if left untreated can lead to periodontal disease. There have been an increased number of studies establishing associations between, periodontal disease and negative health outcomes, which include tooth loss, cardiovascular disease, stroke, poor diabetes control, and adverse birth outcomes. For example, one such study found that moderate or severe periodontal disease early in pregnancy was associated with delivery of small-for-gestational-age infant. Other studies have also found an association between periodontal disease and development of pre-eclampsia and pre-term births.\n\nAnother notable oral disease pertinent to maternal child health is dental caries. Dental caries is the process of tooth decay, and the development of what is commonly known as cavities. Dental caries are transmitted from mother to child vertically; colonization of cariogenic bacteria primarily occurs from mother to child through saliva-sharing activities. Maternal oral flora can ultimately foretell oral flora in offspring. In addition, other maternal factors such as social, behavioral, and biological factors can predispose a child's experience with tooth-decay. Some of these factors include the lack of knowledge a mother possesses concerning oral health, which can influence the development of caries among her children. Compared to children whose mothers have good oral health, children whose mothers have bad oral health are five times as likely to have poor oral health. Poor maintenance of oral health has profound implications on the development of children. As mentioned in the Surgeon's General Report, oral health affects the quality of life, especially children, with respect to functional, psychological, economic, and overall emotional well-being of an individual. To demonstrate the adverse effects of poor oral health, take for example the consequences a simple cavity can have on a child. First, it is painful. This might cause a child to miss school or have poor concentration, eventually compromising school performance. In addition, due to the pain, it might result in poor weight gain or growth. Also, children may exhibit reduced self-esteem because of cosmetic issues. Furthermore, it can affect language and impair speech. Impaired speech development can also result in low self-esteem. Finally, cavities although easily preventable, can pose a financial burden of a family. Public dental services are scarce and costly to individuals who lack dental insurance. It may also result in unwarranted visits to emergency department. Poor oral health permeates into other aspects of life, posing threats to overall well-being, if not handled timely and effectively\n\nThe significance of oral health is apparent, however, many women do not receive dental services before, during, and after pregnancy, even with obvious signs of oral disease. There are several factors at play regarding pregnant women not seeking dental care, including the role of the health care system and disposition of the woman herself. There is a common misconception that it is not safe to obtain dental services while pregnant. Many prenatal and oral health providers have limited knowledge about the impact and safety of delivering dental services; hence they might delay or withhold treatment during pregnancy. Moreover, some prenatal providers are not aware of the importance of oral health on overall general health, thus failing to refer their patients to dental providers. First and foremost, the misconception regarding the impact of dental services while a woman is pregnant needs to be purged. There is a consensus that prevention, diagnosis, and treatment of oral diseases are highly beneficial and can be performed on pregnant women having no added fetal or maternal risk when compared to the risk of providing no oral care. Equally important is establishing collaboration among clinicians, especially maternal health providers, with other dental providers. There should be coordination among general health and oral health providers, especially because of the interdependence of the two fields. Thus, it is imperative to educate and train health providers of the significance of oral health, designing methods to incorporate in their respective practices. Providers most provide education to pregnant women addressing the importance of oral health, because these women ultimately control the fate of themselves and their offspring. For example, providers can illustrate to mothers how to reduce cavities by wiping down the gums of their children with a soft cloth after breastfeeding or bottle-feeding. Bestowing knowledge and practical applications of good oral health maintenance measures to mothers can help improve overall health of the mother and child. \nThere are still other factors in play when analyzing the low use of dental services by pregnant women, particularly prevalent among ethnic and racial minorities. A major factor is the lack of insurance and or access to dental services. For this reason, more data needs to be collected and analyzed so that programs are set up to effectively to reach all segments of the population.\n\nPrenatal care is an important part of basic maternal health care. It is recommended expectant mothers receive at least four antenatal visits, in which a health worker can check for signs of ill health – such as underweight, anaemia or infection – and monitor the health of the foetus. During these visits, women are counseled on nutrition and hygiene to improve their health prior to, and following, delivery. They can also develop a birth plan laying out how to reach care and what to do in case of an emergency.\n\nPoverty, malnutrition, and substance abuse may contribute to impaired cognitive, motor, and behavioral problems across childhood. In other words, if a mother is not in optimal health during the prenatal period (the time while she is pregnant) and/or the fetus is exposed to teratogen(s), the child is more likely to experience health or developmental difficulties, or death. The environment in which the mother provides for the embryo/fetus is critical to its wellbeing well after gestation and birth.\n\nA teratogen is \"any agent that can potentially cause a birth defect or negatively alter cognitive and behavioral outcomes.\" Dose, genetic susceptibility, and time of exposure are all factors for the extent of the effect of a teratogen on an embryo or fetus.\n\nPrescription drugs taken during pregnancy such as streptomycin, tetracycline, some antidepressants, progestin, synthetic estrogen, and Accutane, as well as over-the-counter drugs such as diet pills, can result in teratogenic outcomes for the developing embryo/fetus. Additionally, high dosages of aspirin are known to lead to maternal and fetal bleeding, although low-dose aspirin is usually not harmful.\n\nNewborns whose mothers use heroin during the gestational period often exhibit withdrawal symptoms at birth and are more likely to have attention problems and health issues as they grow up. Use of stimulants like methamphetamine and cocaine during pregnancy are linked to a number of problems for the child such as low birth weight and small head circumference and motor and cognitive developmental delays, as well as behavioral problems across childhood. The American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry found that 6 year-olds whose mothers had smoked during pregnancy scored lower on an intelligence test than children whose mothers had not.\n\nCigarette smoking during pregnancy can have a multitude of detrimental effects on the health and development of the offspring. Common results of smoking during pregnancy include pre-term births, low birth weights, fetal and neonatal deaths, respiratory problems, and sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS), as well as increased risk for cognitive impairment, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and other behavioral problems. Also, in a study published in the International Journal of Cancer, children whose mothers smoked during pregnancy experienced a 22% risk increase for non-Hodgkin lymphoma.\n\nAlthough alcohol use in careful moderation (one to two servings a few days a week) during pregnancy are not generally known to cause fetal alcohol spectrum disorder (FASD), the US Surgeon General advises against the consumption of alcohol at all during pregnancy. Excessive alcohol use during pregnancy can cause FASD, which commonly consist of physical and cognitive abnormalities in the child such as facial deformities, defective limbs, face, and heart, learning problems, below average intelligence, and intellectual disability (ID).\n\nAlthough HIV/AIDS can be transmitted to offspring at different times, the most common time that mothers pass on the virus is during pregnancy. During the perinatal period, the embryo/fetus can contract the virus through the placenta.\n\nGestational diabetes is directly linked with obesity in offspring through adolescence. Additionally, children whose mothers had diabetes are more likely to develop Type II diabetes. Mothers who have gestational diabetes have a high chance of giving birth to very large infants (10 pounds or more).\n\nBecause the embryo or fetus's nutrition is based on maternal protein, vitamin, mineral, and total caloric intake, infants born to malnourished mothers are more likely to exhibit malformations. Additionally, maternal stress can affect the fetus both directly and indirectly. When a mother is under stress, physiological changes occur in the body that could harm the developing fetus. Additionally, the mother is more likely to engage in behaviors that could negatively affect the fetus, such as tobacco smoking, drug use, and alcohol abuse.\n\nGenital herpes is passed to the offspring through the birth canal during delivery. In pregnancies where the mother is infected with the virus, 25% of babies delivered through an infected birth canal become brain damaged, and 1/3 die. HIV/AIDS can also be transmitted during childbirth through contact with the mother's body fluids. Mothers in developed countries may often elect to undergo a caesarean section to reduce the risk of transmitting the virus through the birth canal, but this option is not always available in developing countries.\n\nGlobally, more than eight million of the 136 million women giving birth each year suffer from excessive bleeding after childbirth. This condition—medically referred to as postpartum hemorrhage (PPH)—causes one out of every four maternal deaths that occur annually and accounts for more maternal deaths than any other individual cause. Deaths due to postpartum hemorrhage disproportionately affect women in developing countries.\n\nFor every woman who dies from causes related to pregnancy, an estimated 20 to 30 encounter serious complications. At least 15 per cent of all births are complicated by a potentially fatal condition. Women who survive such complications often require lengthy recovery times and may face lasting physical, psychological, social and economic consequences. Although many of these complications are unpredictable, almost all are treatable.\n\nDuring the postpartum period, many mothers breastfeed their infants. Transmission of HIV/AIDS through breastfeeding is a huge issue in developing countries, namely in African countries. The majority of infants who contract HIV through breast milk do so within the first six weeks of life. However, in healthy mothers, there are many benefits for infants who are breastfed. The World Health Organization recommends that mothers breastfeed their children for the first two years of life, whereas the American Academy of Pediatrics and the American Academy of Family Physicians recommend that mothers do so for at least the first six months, and continue as long as is mutually desired. Infants who are breastfed by healthy mothers (not infected with HIV/AIDS) are less prone to infections such as \"Haemophilus influenza, Streptococcus pneunoniae, Vibrio cholerae, Escherichia coli, Giardia lamblia\", group B streptococci, \"Staphylococcus epidermidis\", rotavirus, respiratory syncytial virus and herpes simplex virus-1, as well as gastrointestinal and lower respiratory tract infections and otitis media. Lower rates of infant mortality are observed in breastfed babies in addition to lower rates of sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS). Decreases in obesity and diseases such as childhood metabolic disease, asthma, atopic dermatitis, Type I diabetes, and childhood cancers are also seen in children who are breastfed.\n\nMaternal health problems include complications from childbirth that do not result in death. For every woman that dies during childbirth, approximately 20 suffer from infection, injury, or disability\n\nAlmost 50% of the births in developing countries still take place without a medically skilled attendant to aid the mother, and the ratio is even higher in South Asia. Women in Sub-Saharan Africa mainly rely on traditional birth attendants (TBAs), who have little or no formal health care training. In recognition of their role, some countries and non-governmental organizations are making efforts to train TBAs in maternal health topics, in order to improve the chances for better health outcomes among mothers and babies.\n\nBreastfeeding provides women with several long-term benefits. Women who breastfeed experience better glucose levels, lipid metabolism, and blood pressure, and lose pregnancy weight faster than those who do not. Additionally, women who breastfeed experience lower rates of breast cancer, ovarian cancer, and type 2 diabetes. However, it is important to keep in mind that breastfeeding provides substantial benefits to women who are not infected with HIV. In countries where HIV/AIDS rates are high, such as South Africa and Kenya, the virus is a leading cause of maternal mortality, especially in mothers who breastfeed. A complication is that many HIV-infected mothers cannot afford formula, and thus have no way of preventing transmission to the child through breast milk or avoiding health risks for themselves. In cases like this, mothers have no choice but to breastfeed their infants regardless of their knowledge of the harmful effects.\n\nWorldwide, the Maternal Mortality Ratio (MMR) has decreased, with South-East Asia seeing the most dramatic decrease of 59% and Africa seeing a decline of 27%. There are no regions that are on track to meet the Millennium Development Goal of decreasing maternal mortality by 75% by the year 2015.\n\nIn a September 2016 ACOG/SMFM consensus, published concurrently in the journal \"Obstetrics & Gynecology\" and by the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG), they noted that while they did not yet have a \"single, comprehensive definition of severe maternal morbidity\" (SMM), the rate of SMM is increasing in the United States as is maternal mortality. Both are \"associated with a high rate of preventability.\"\n\nThe U.S. Joint Commission on Accreditation of Healthcare Organizations calls maternal mortality a \"sentinel event\", and uses it to assess the quality of a health care system.\n\nMaternal mortality data is said to be an important indicator of overall health system quality because pregnant women survive in sanitary, safe, well-staffed and stocked facilities. If new mothers are thriving, it indicates that the health care system is doing its job. If not, problems likely exist.\n\nAccording to Garret, increasing maternal survival, along with life expectancy, is an important goal for the world health community, as they show that other health issues are also improving. If these areas improve, disease-specific improvements are also better able to positively impact populations.\n\nDecreasing the rates of maternal mortality and morbidity in developing countries is important because poor maternal health is both an indicator and a cause of extreme poverty. According to Tamar Manuelyan Atinc, Vice President for Human Development at the World Bank:\n\n\"Maternal deaths are both caused by poverty and are a cause of it. The costs of childbirth can quickly exhaust a family's income, bringing with it even more financial hardship.\"\n\nIn many developing countries, complications of pregnancy and childbirth are the leading causes of death among women of reproductive age. A woman dies from complications from childbirth approximately every minute. According to the World Health Organization, in its \"World Health Report 2005\", poor maternal conditions account for the fourth leading cause of death for women worldwide, after HIV/AIDS, malaria, and tuberculosis. Most maternal deaths and injuries are caused by biological processes, not from disease, which can be prevented and have been largely eradicated in the developed world — such as postpartum hemorrhaging, which causes 34% of maternal deaths in the developing world but only 13% of maternal deaths in developed countries.\n\nAlthough high-quality, accessible health care has made maternal death a rare event in developed countries, where only 1% of maternal deaths occur, these complications can often be fatal in the developing world because single most important intervention for safe motherhood is to make sure that a trained provider with midwifery skills is present at every birth, that transport is available to referral services, and that quality emergency obstetric care is available. In 2008 342,900 women died while pregnant or from childbirth worldwide. Although a high number, this was a significant drop from 1980, when 526,300 women died from the same causes. This improvement was caused by lower pregnancy rates in some countries; higher income, which improves nutrition and access to health care; more education for women; and the increasing availability of \"skilled birth attendants\" — people with training in basic and emergency obstetric care — to help women give birth. The situation was especially led by improvements in large countries like India and China, which helped to drive down the overall death rates. In India, the government started paying for prenatal and delivery care to ensure access, and saw successes in reducing maternal mortality, so much so that India is cited as the major reason for the decreasing global rates of maternal mortality.\n\nUntil the early 20th century developed and developing countries had similar rates of maternal mortality. Since most maternal deaths and injuries are preventable, they have been largely eradicated in the developed world.\n\nThe U.S. has the \"highest rate of maternal mortality in the industrialized world.\" It is also estimated that 50% of the deaths are from preventable causes.\n\nSince 2016, ProPublica and NPR investigated factors that led to the increase in maternal mortality in the United States. They reported that the \"rate of life-threatening complications for new mothers in the U.S. has more than doubled in two decades due to pre-existing conditions, medical errors and unequal access to care.\" According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, c. 4 million women who give birth in the US annually, over 50,000 a year, experience \"dangerous and even life-threatening complications.\" Of those 700 to 900 die every year \"related to pregnancy and childbirth.\" A \"pervasive problem\" is the rapidly increasing rate of \"severe maternal morbidity\" (SMM), which does not yet have a \"single, comprehensive definition\".\n\nAccording to a report by the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, in 1993 the rate of Severe Maternal Morbidity, rose from 49.5 to 144 \"per 10,000 delivery hospitalizations\" in 2014, an increase of almost 200 percent. Blood transfusions also increased during the same period with \"from 24.5 in 1993 to 122.3 in 2014 and are considered to be the major driver of the increase in SMM. After excluding blood transfusions, the rate of SMM increased by about 20% over time, from 28.6 in 1993 to 35.0 in 2014.\"\n\nThe World Bank estimated that a total of 3.00 US dollars per person a year can provide basic family planning and both maternal and neonatal health care to women in developing countries. Many non-profit organizations have programs educating the public and gaining access to emergency obstetric care for mothers in developing countries. The United Nations Population Fund (UNPFA) recently began its Campaign on Accelerated Reduction of Maternal Mortality in Africa (CARMMA), focusing on providing quality healthcare to mothers. One of the programs within CARMMA is Sierra Leone providing free healthcare to mothers and children. This initiative has widespread support from African leaders and was started in conjunction with the African Union Health Ministers.\n\nImproving maternal health is the fifth of the United Nations' eight Millennium Development Goals (MDGs), targeting a reduction in the number of women dying during pregnancy and childbirth by three quarters by 2015, notably by increasing the usage of skilled birth attendants, contraception and family planning. The current decline of maternal deaths is only half of what is necessary to achieve this goal, and in several regions such as Sub-Saharan Africa the maternal mortality rate is actually increasing. However, one country that may meet their MDG 5 is Nepal, which has it appears reduced its maternal mortality by more than 50% since the early 1990s. As the 2015 deadline for the MDG's approaches, an understanding of the policy developments leading to the inclusion of maternal health within the MDG's is essential for future advocacy efforts.\n\nAccording to the UNFPA, maternal deaths would be reduced by about two-thirds, from 287,000 to 105,000, if needs for modern family planning and maternal and newborn health care were met. Therefore, investing in family planning and improved maternal health care brings many benefits including reduced risks of complications and improvement in health for mothers and their children. Education is also critical with research showing \"that women with no education were nearly three times more likely to die during pregnancy and childbirth than women who had finished secondary school.\" Evidence shows that women who are better educated tend to have healthier children. Education would also improve employment opportunities for women which results in improving their status, contributing to family savings, reducing poverty and contributing to economic growth. All of these invests bring significant benefits and effects not only for women and girls but also their children, families, communities and their country.\n\nDeveloped countries had rates of maternal mortality similar to those of developing countries until the early 20th century, therefore several lessons can be learned from the west. During the 19th century Sweden had high levels of maternal mortality, and there was a strong support within the country to reduce mortality rate to fewer than 300 per 100,000 live births. The Swedish government began public health initiatives to train enough midwives to attend all births. This approach was also later used by Norway, Denmark, and the Netherlands who also experienced similar successes.\n\nIncreasing contraceptive usage and family planning also improves maternal health through reduction in numbers of higher risk pregnancies and by lowering the inter-pregnancy interval. In Nepal a strong emphasis was placed on providing family planning to rural regions and it was shown to be effective. Madagascar saw a dramatic increase in contraceptive use after instituting a nationwide family planning program, the rate of contraceptive use increased from 5.1% in 1992 to 29% in 2008.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "39596990", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=39596990", "title": "Mink hunting", "text": "Mink hunting\n\nMink hunting is a country sport involving the hunting of American mink with scent hounds along the waterways which make up their habitat, in a manner similar to fox hunting. Mink hunting took place in the countryside in the UK and Ireland, but since 2005 traditional mink hunting has been banned in England and Wales.\n\nWhen the sport of otter hunting was given up in the British Isles in the late 1970s due to otters becoming endangered, many packs of Otterhounds converted to hunting the invasive American mink, which had become established in Britain from 1950 onward, from fur farm escapees. Unsuccessful efforts to eradicate the mink led to it being widely viewed as an invasive pest in Britain and in Ireland (where a bounty is paid per Mink killed).\n\nThere are 22 packs of Minkhounds in the UK, registered with the Masters of Minkhounds Association, and four packs in Ireland, registered with the Mink Hounds Association. Mink hunts meet once or twice a week over the Summer, from April to October, and draw waterways searching for mink. Followers try to keep up on foot, which may involve wading across a river. When a mink is found, a chase will ensue, with hounds hunting the scent of the mink until they catch it. It is estimated up to 1,400 mink were killed a year by mink hunts in the UK. Since the 2005 ban, mink hunts in the UK have adapted to the new legislation by undertaking legal trail hunting and other forms of exempt hunting (such as hunting rats).\n\nThe hounds used for Minkhunting are usually elderly foxhounds, drafted from foxhound packs, though some packs also use the historic Otterhound breed.\n\n"}
{"id": "15925282", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=15925282", "title": "Mobility aid", "text": "Mobility aid\n\nA mobility aid is a device designed to assist walking or otherwise improve the mobility of people with a mobility impairment.\n\nThere are various walking aids which can help people with impaired ability to walk and wheelchairs or mobility scooters for more severe disability or longer journeys which would otherwise be undertaken on foot. For people who are blind or visually impaired the white cane and guide dog have a long history of use. Other aids can help with mobility or transfer within a building or where there are changes of level.\n\nTraditionally the phrase \"mobility aid\" has applied mainly to low technology mechanical devices. The term also appears in government documents, for example dealing with tax concessions of various kinds. It refers to those devices whose use enables a freedom of movement similar to that of unassisted walking or standing up from a chair.\n\nTechnical advances can be expected to increase the scope of these devices considerably, for example by use of sensors and audio or tactile feedback.\n\nWalking aids include assistive canes (commonly referred to as walking sticks), crutches, and walkers. As appropriate to the needs of the individual user, these devices help to maintain upright ambulation by providing any or all of: improved stability, reduced lower-limb loading and generating movement.\n\nThe cane or walking stick is the simplest form of walking aid. It is held in the hand and transmits loads to the floor through a shaft. The load which can be applied through a cane is transmitted through the user's hands and wrists and limited by these.\n\nA crutch also transmits loads to the ground through a shaft, but has two points of contact with the arm, at the hand and either below the elbow or below the armpit. This allows significantly greater loads to be exerted through a crutch in comparison with a cane.\n\nDevices on the market today include a number of combinations for canes, crutches, and forearm crutches. These crutches have bands that encircle the upper arms and handles for the patient to hold and rest their hands to support the body weight. The forearm crutch typically gives a user the support of the cane but with additional forearm support to assist in mobility. The forearm portion helps increase balance, lateral stability and also reduces the load on the wrist.\n\nA walker (also known as a Zimmer frame) is the most stable walking aid and consists of a freestanding metal framework with three or more points of contact which the user places in front of them and then grips during movement. The points of contact may be either fixed rubber ferrules as with crutches and canes, or wheels, or a combination of both. Wheeled walkers are also known as rollators. Many of these walkers also come with an inbuilt seat so that the user may rest during use and with metal pouches to carry personal belongings.\n\nA walker cane hybrid was introduced in 2012 designed to bridge the gap between a cane and a walker. The hybrid has two legs which provide lateral (side-to-side) support which a cane does not. It can be used with two hands in front of the user, similar to a walker, and provides an increased level of support compared with a cane. It can be adjusted for use with either one or two hands, at the front and at the side, as well as a stair climbing assistant. The hybrid is not designed to replace a walker which normally has four legs and provides 4-way support using both hands.\n\nAnother device to assist walking that has entered the market in recent years is the gait trainer. This is a mobility aid that is more supportive than the standard walker. It typically offers support that assists weight-bearing and balance. The accessories or product parts that attach to the product frame provide unweighting support and postural alignment to enable walking practice.\n\nThe Walk Aid Scooter allows a user with normal balance and foot, knee or hip conditions to unload the lower extremities. The two-wheeled scooter has a bicycle-type seat and handlebars, and is manually propelled with one or both feet like a balance bicycle. This walking aid scooter provides more support than a cane and is lighter,less bulky and easier to propel than a wheelchair.\n\nWheelchairs and mobility scooters substitute for walking by providing a wheeled device on which the user sits. Wheelchairs may be either manually propelled (by the user or by an aide) or electrically powered (commonly known as a \"powerchair\"). Mobility scooters are electrically powered, as are motorized wheelchairs.\nWheelchairs and Scooters are normally recommended for any individual due to significant mobility/balance impairment. A Registered Occupational Therapist or Physiotherapist (few cases) are able to provide object and clinical testing to ensure proper and safe device recommendations.\n\nA stairlift is a mechanical device for lifting people and wheelchairs up and down stairs. Sometimes special purpose lifts are provided elsewhere to facilitate access for the disabled, for example at entrances to raised bus stops in Curitiba, Brazil (illustrated above). A wheelchair lift is specifically designed to carry the user and the wheelchair. This can either be through floor or utilizing the staircase.\n\nMobility aids may also include adaptive technology such as sling lifts or other patient transfer devices that help transfer users between beds and chairs or lift chairs (and other sit-to-stand devices), transfer or convertible chairs. Knee scooters help some users.\n\n\n"}

The reflex is mediated by nerve connections between the ophthalmic branch of the trigeminal cranial nerve via the ciliary ganglion, and the vagus nerve of the parasympathetic nervous system. Nerve fibres from the maxillary and mandibular divisions of the trigeminal nerve have also been documented. These afferents synapse with the visceral motor nucleus of the vagus nerve, located in the reticular formation of the brain stem. The efferent portion is carried by the vagus nerve from the cardiovascular center of the medulla to the heart, of which increased stimulation leads to decreased output of the sinoatrial node. This reflex is especially sensitive in neonates and children, particularly during strabismus correction surgery. However, this reflex may also occur with adults. Bradycardia, junctional rhythm and asystole, all of which may be life-threatening, can be induced through this reflex. This reflex has been seen to occur during many pan facial trauma surgeries due to stimulation of any of the three branches of trigeminal nerve.\n\nThe reflex can be blocked by intravenous injection of an anti-muscarinic acetylcholine (ACh) antagonist, such as atropine or glycopyrrolate. If bradycardia does occur, removal of the stimulus is immediately indicated. This often results in the restoration of normal sinus rhythm of the heart. If not, the use of atropine or glycopyrrolate will usually be successful and permit continuation of the surgical procedure. In extreme cases, such as asystole, cardiopulmonary resuscitation may be required.\n\n"}

{"id": "3346770", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=3346770", "title": "Prostate cancer screening", "text": "Prostate cancer screening\n\nProstate cancer screening is the screening process used to detect undiagnosed prostate cancer in those without signs or symptoms. When abnormal prostate tissue or cancer is found early, it may be easier to treat and cure, but it is unclear if early detection reduces mortality rates.\n\nScreening precedes a diagnosis and subsequent treatment. The digital rectal examination (DRE) is one screening tool during which the prostate is manually assessed through the wall of the rectum. The second screening tool is the measurement of prostate-specific antigen (PSA) in the blood. The evidence remains insufficient to determine whether screening with prostate-specific antigen (PSA) or digital rectal exam (DRE) reduces mortality from prostate cancer. A 2013 Cochrane review concluded PSA screening results in \"no statistically significant difference in prostate cancer-specific mortality...\" The American studies were determined to have a high bias. European studies included in this review were of low bias and one reported \"a significant reduction in prostate cancer-specific mortality.\" PSA screening with DRE was not assessed in this review. DRE was not assessed separately. \n\nGuidelines generally recommend that the decisions whether or not to screen be based on shared decision-making. This involves men being informed of the risks and benefits of screening. The American Society of Clinical Oncology recommends screening be discouraged in those who are expected to live less than ten years, while in those with a life expectancy of greater than ten years a decision should be made by the person in question. In general, they conclude that based on recent research, \"it is uncertain whether the benefits associated with PSA testing for prostate cancer screening are worth the harms associated with screening and subsequent unnecessary treatment.\"\n\nProstate biopsies are used to diagnose prostate cancer but are not done on asymptomatic men and therefore are not used for screening. Biopsies are the gold standard in detecting prostate cancer. Infection after prostate biopsy occurs in about 1% while death occurs as a result of biopsy in 0.2%. Prostate biopsy guided by magnetic resonance imaging has improved the diagnostic accuracy of the procedure.\n\nProstate-specific antigen (PSA) is secreted by the epithelial cells of the prostate gland and can be detected in a sample of blood. PSA is present in small quantities in the serum of men with healthy prostates, but is often elevated in the presence of prostate cancer or other prostate disorders. PSA is not a unique indicator of prostate cancer, but may also detect prostatitis or benign prostatic hyperplasia.\n\nA 2018 United States Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) draft reversed the prior opposition to PSA screening. The draft recommendations suggest shared decision-making regarding screening in healthy males 55 to 69 years of age. The final recommendation for that age group states screening should only be done in those who wish it. In those 70 and over, screening remains not recommended.\n\nScreening with PSA has been associated with a number of harms including over-diagnosis, increased prostate biopsy with associated harms, increased anxiety, and unneeded treatment.\n\nOn the other hand, up to 25% of men diagnosed in their 70s or even 80s die of prostate cancer, \"if\" they have high-grade (i.e., aggressive) prostate cancer. Conversely, some argue against PSA testing for men who are too young, because too many men would have to be screened to find one cancer, and too many men would have treatment for cancer that would not progress. Low-risk prostate cancer does not always require immediate treatment, but may be amenable to active surveillance. A PSA test cannot 'prove' the existence of prostate cancer by itself; varying levels of the antigen can be due to other causes.\n\nDuring a digital rectal examination (DRE), a healthcare provider slides a gloved finger into the rectum and presses on the prostate, to check its size and to check whether any lumps are present. If the examination suggests anomalies, a PSA test is performed. If an elevated PSA level is found, a follow-up test is then performed.\n\nA 2018 review recommended against primary care screening for prostate cancer with DRE due to the lack of evidence of the effectiveness of the practice. \n\nProstate biopsies are considered the gold standard in detecting prostate cancer. Infection is a possible risk. MRI guided techniques have improved the diagnostic accuracy of the procedure. Biopsies can be done through the rectum or penis.\n\nTransrectal ultrasonography (TRUS) has the advantage of being fast and minimally invasive, and better than MRI for the evaluation of superficial tumor. It also gives details about the layers of the rectal wall, accurate and useful for staging primary rectal cancer. While MRI is better in visualization of locally advanced and stenosing cancers, for staging perirectal lymph nodes, both TRUS and MRI are capable. TRUS has a small field of view, but 3D TRUS can improve the diagnosis of anorectal diseases.\n\nMRI imaging is used when screening suggests a malignancy. This model potentially minimizes unnecessary prostate biopsies while maximizing biopsy yield. Despite concerns about the cost of MRI scans, compared to the long-term cost burden of the PSA/TRUS biopsy-based standard of care, the imaging model has been found to be cost-effective. MRI imaging can be used for patients who have had a previous negative biopsy but their PSA continues to increase. Consensus has not been determined as to which of the MRI-targeted biopsy techniques is more useful.\n\nGa-PSMA PET/CT imaging has become, in a relatively short period of time, the gold standard for restaging recurrent prostate cancer in clinical centers in which this imaging modality is available. It is likely to become the standard imaging modality in the staging of intermediate-to-high risk primary prostate cancer. The potential to guide therapy, and to facilitate more accurate prostatic biopsy is being explored. In the theranostic paradigm, Ga-PSMA PET/CT imaging is critical for detecting prostate specific membrane antigen-avid disease which may then respond to targeted Lu-PSMA or Ac-PSMA therapies. For local recurrence, Ga-PSMA PET/MR or PET/CT in combination with mpMR is most appropriate. PSMA PET/CT may be potentially helpful for locating the cancer when combined with multiparametric MRI (mpMRI) for primary prostate care. Prostate multiparametric MR imaging (mpMRI) is helpful in evaluating recurrence of primary prostate cancer following treatment.\n\n\n\nFrom population screening to early diagnosis there is a lack of understanding. Screening for prostate cancer continues to generate debate by clinicians and broader lay audiences. Publications authored by governmental, non-governmental and medical organizations continue the debate and publish recommendations for screening. One in six men will be diagnosed with prostate cancer during their lifetime but screening may result in the overdiagnosis and overtreatment of prostate cancer. Though the death rates from prostate cancer continue to decline, 238,590 men were diagnosed with prostate cancer in 2013 while 29,720 died as a result. Death rates from prostate cancer have declined at a steady rate since 1992. Cancers of the prostate, lung and bronchus, and colorectum account for about 50% of all newly diagnosed cancers in men. Prostate cancer alone constitutes 28% cases in men. Screening for prostate cancer varies by state and indicates differences in the use of screening for prostate cancer as well as variations between locales. Out all cases of prostate cancer, African american men have an incidence of 62%. African American men are less likely to receive standard therapy for prostate cancer. This discrepancy may indicate that if they were to receive higher quality cancer treatment their survival rates would be similar to whites.\n\nProstate cancer is also extremely heterogeneous: many, perhaps most, prostate cancers are indolent and would never progress to a clinically meaningful stage if left undiagnosed and untreated during a man's lifetime. On the other hand, a subset are potentially lethal, and screening can identify some of these within a window of opportunity for cure. Thus, the concept of PSA screening is advocated by some as a means of detecting \"high-risk\", potentially lethal prostate cancer, with the understanding that lower-risk disease, if discovered, often does not need treatment and may be amenable to active surveillance.\n\nScreening for prostate cancer is controversial because of cost and uncertain long-term benefits to patients. Horan echos that sentiment in his book.\n\nPrivate medical institutes, such as the Mayo Clinic, likewise acknowledge that \"organizations vary in their recommendations about who should – and who shouldn't – get a PSA screening test. They conclude: \"Ultimately, whether you should have a PSA test is something you'll have to decide after discussing it with your doctor, considering your risk factors and weighing your personal preferences.\"\n\nA study in Europe resulted in only a small decline in death rates and concluded that 48 men would need to be treated to save one life. But of the 47 men who were treated, most would be unable to ever again function sexually and would require more frequent trips to the bathroom. Aggressive marketing of screening tests by drug companies has also generated controversy as has the advocacy of testing by the American Urological Association.\n\nOne commentator has observed: “[I]t is prudent only to use a single PSA determination as a baseline, with biopsy and cancer treatment reserved for those with significant PSA changes over time, or for those with clinical manifestations mandating immediate therapy... absolute levels of PSA are rarely meaningful; it is the relative change in PSA levels over time that provides insight, but not definitive proof of a cancerous condition necessitating therapy.“\n\nScreening of PSA began in the 1990s. In the European Randomized Study of Screening for Prostate Cancer (ERSPC) initiated in the early 1990s, the researchers concluded that PSA-based screening did reduce the rate of death from prostate cancer but created a high risk of overdiagnosis, i.e., 1410 men would need to be screened and 48 additional cases of prostate cancer would need to be treated to prevent just one death from prostate cancer within 9 years.\n\nA study published in the European Journal of Cancer (October 2009) documented that prostate cancer screening reduced prostate cancer mortality by 37 percent. By utilizing a control group of men from Northern Ireland, where PSA screening is infrequent, the research showed this substantial reduction in prostate cancer deaths when compared to men who were PSA tested as part of the ERSPC study.\n\nA study published in the New England Journal of Medicine in 2009 found that over a 7 to 10-year period, \"screening did not reduce the death rate in men 55 and over.\" Former screening proponents, including some from Stanford University, have come out against routine testing. In February 2010, the American Cancer Society urged \"more caution in using the test.\" And the American College of Preventive Medicine concluded that \"there was insufficient evidence to recommend routine screening.\"\n\nA further study, the NHS Comparison Arm for ProtecT (CAP), as part of the Prostate testing for cancer and Treatment (ProtecT) study, randomized GP practices with 460,000 men aged 50–69 at centers in 9 cities in Britain from 2001–2005 to usual care or prostate cancer screening with PSA (biopsy if PSA ≥ 3). The \"Comparison Arm\" has yet to report as of early 2018.\n\n"}

It was developed by Robert M. Koch in 1963 as an answer to the difficulties of using a feed conversion ratio to compare individual animals. Effective use of RFI data can greatly improve beef cattle farm profits. This approach is based on regression models developed for determining efficiency of feed use for weight gain during a standardized growth trial in growing beef cattle.\n\nIt was inspired by Koch's observations of the differences in how a maintained body weight and an increasing body weight affect the feeding of cattle. His research suggested that feed intake could be broken into two parts:\n\nThrough the use of these two items, animals that deviate from the expected feed intake, either by eating more than or less than what's expected of them, can be identified and managed as the farmer sees fit. Because feed intake is heritable, knowing the RFI index of an animal is also useful when breeding. By selecting animals with the aim to reduce RFI, farmers can breed animals that eat less but continue at the same rate of production. \n\nThere is no phenotype link between RFI and the characteristics used to calculate expected feed intake, which allows for the comparison of animals who function at differing production numbers. This has led some authors to believe that RFI is representative of individual differences in the metabolic processes of the animals. For example, one study shows that the amount of feed a Hereford bull requires to maintain a kilogram of body weight is closely related to genetic variation in its RFI. Similarly, in laying hens, variation in RFI is directly linked to variations in maintenance energy expenditure.\n"}

The position is more formally known as the \"Permanent Representative of the United States of America to the United Nations, with the rank and status of Ambassador Extraordinary and Plenipotentiary, and Representative of the United States of America in the Security Council of the United Nations\"; it is also known as the U.S. Permanent Representative to the United Nations.\n\nThe U.S. Permanent Representative, currently Nikki Haley, is charged with representing the United States on the U.N. Security Council and during almost all plenary meetings of the General Assembly, except in the rare situation in which a more senior officer of the United States (such as the U.S. Secretary of State or the President of the United States) is present. Like all United States ambassadors, he or she must be nominated by the U.S. President and confirmed by the Senate.\n\nMany prominent U.S. politicians and diplomats have held the post, including Adlai Stevenson II, George H. W. Bush, Jeane Kirkpatrick, and Madeleine Albright. The Ambassador serves at the pleasure of the President, and is therefore appointed by the President. \n\nNikki Haley was nominated for this position by President Donald Trump and was confirmed by the Senate. She assumed office upon presenting her credentials to the UN Secretary-General on January 27, 2017, but tendered her resignation to President Trump on October 9, 2018, to be effective on December 31.\nHenry Cabot Lodge Jr., a leading moderate Republican who lost his seat in the United States Senate to John F. Kennedy in the 1952 elections, was appointed ambassador to the United Nations in 1953 by Dwight D. Eisenhower in gratitude for the defeated senator's role in the new president's defeat of conservative leader Robert A. Taft for the 1952 Republican nomination and subsequent service as his campaign manager in the general election; Eisenhower raised the ambassadorship to cabinet rank in order to give Lodge direct access to him without having to go through the State Department.\n\nThe Ambassadorship continued to hold this status through the Ford, Carter, and Reagan administrations but was removed from cabinet rank by George H. W. Bush, who had previously held the position himself. It was restored under the Clinton administration. It was not a cabinet-level position under the George W. Bush administration (from 2001 to 2009), but was once again elevated under the Obama administration, and retained as such by the Trump administration.\n\nFormer UN Ambassador (and current National Security Advisor) John R. Bolton has publicly opposed the granting of cabinet-level status to the office, stating \"One, it overstates the role and importance the U.N. should have in U.S. foreign policy, second, you shouldn't have two secretaries in the same department\".\n\nThe following is a chronological list of those who have held the office:\nAs of , there are twelve living former U.S. Ambassadors to the United Nation (with all Ambassadors that have served since 2001 still living), the oldest being Edward J. Perkins (served 1992–1993, born 1928). The most recent Ambassador to die was George H. W. Bush (served 1971–1973, born 1924), on November 30, 2018.\n"}
{"id": "32241450", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=32241450", "title": "Vaccine-induced seropositivity", "text": "Vaccine-induced seropositivity\n\nVaccine-induced seropositivity or VISP is the phenomenon wherein a person who has received a vaccine against a disease would thereafter give a positive or reactive test result for having that disease when tested for it, despite not actually having the disease. This happens because many vaccines encourage the body to produce antibodies against a particular disease, and blood tests often determine whether a person has those antibodies, regardless of whether they came from the infection or just a vaccination.\n\nVISP is especially a concern in vaccine trials for HIV vaccine research because people who give a positive result in an HIV test, even if that result is because of a vaccine and not because of an infection, may face discrimination because of HIV infection.\n\nIn 1987 in America the first HIV vaccine was tested. HIV vaccines have been tested continually worldwide since then, but thus far, no one has developed any vaccine which reduces a person's risk of contracting HIV if exposed to that virus.\n\nMany HIV tests work not by checking a person's blood for HIV, but rather by determining whether the body's own antibodies against HIV are present in the blood. Most HIV vaccines are designed with the intent to promote the body's own production of antibodies which would combat HIV. Regardless of whether they are effective at stimulating the production of antibodies which fight HIV, they usually do cause the body to produce antibodies which standard HIV tests recognize as the antibodies which an HIV positive person would produce in response to HIV infection.\n\nA person who is HIV negative, and has received an HIV vaccine, and who then tests as positive in an HIV test is said to be positive because of VISP.\n\nWhen an HIV-negative person exhibits VISP and gets an HIV-positive result from a test then that person may have difficulty donating blood or negotiating for a life insurance policy.\n\nBetween 1987 and 2003 the number of persons who received experimental HIV vaccinations was about 10,000, and this number was considered small. The difficulties in determining the difference between antibodies produced by HIV infection and vaccine-induced antibodies were managed by individual vaccine research sites who had special capability to conduct additional laboratory testing on this small pool of vaccine recipients. However, at this time two new studies, the STEP Study in the USA and the RV 144 study in Thailand, greatly increased the number of people who received HIV vaccinations by another 4600 people. There came to be an increased need to raise awareness of VISP because more people were exhibiting it.\n\nAt the 2010 International AIDS conference presenters talked about the need for community healthcare providers to understand that if their patients have been in an HIV vaccine trial then their patients are likely to give a false positive HIV test result.\n\nHIV vaccine research happens worldwide to ensure that any vaccine which researchers develop could be used for people worldwide. In developing countries with limited access to healthcare, the problems associated with VISP are a special concern.\n\nResearchers from Africa, Asia, North America, and South America have said that getting local government and media support of the research is essential in addition to creating facilities for distinguishing between HIV positive individuals and individuals exhibiting VISP.\n\nPeople who participate in vaccine trials which test HIV vaccines may exhibit VISP for years or for the rest of their lives.\n\nA study done on participants in the HIV Vaccine Trials Network HIV vaccination studies showed that among 2176 HIV negative participants who received a vaccine, 908 (42%) had VISP. However, the occurrence of VISP varied depending on what kind of vaccine the participants received.\n\nWhen a person gets a hepatitis B vaccine then the most common test for hepatitis B will show them to be positive. The usual course of action in this case is to give the person a panel of tests for HBsAg, anti-HBc, and anti-HBs (hepatitis B surface antigen, anti-hepatitis B core, and anti-hepatitis B surface). A person who has never been exposed to hepatitis B but has gotten the vaccine will be positive for anti-HBs but negative for the other two tests in the panel. Other combinations of positive and negative in this test can mean other things, such as acute, chronic, or past infection.\n\nVISP is not often a practical concern for other diseases because in most cases good vaccines already exist and most people who have access to healthcare receive them. Also doctors do not routinely test people for recent infections with most diseases as they do for HIV.\n\nMedical literature on VISP for most diseases is not widely available because there is little practical need for doing that research.\n\n<Surender Khurana, Needham J, Mathieson B, Rodriguez-Chavez IR, Catanzaro AT, Bailer RT, Kim J, Polonis V, Cooper DA, Guerin J, Peterson ML, Gurwith M, Nguyen N, Graham BS, Golding H.
