The flu or \"influenza\" is mainly a seasonal disease that becomes most prevalent in winter.\n\nThe first infection was confirmed on May 7 in a man who had come from Mexico City and had entered the country without symptoms on April 24. The second case was detected on May 22. Towards the end of May infection started in some schools in the northern community of the City of Buenos Aires and its suburbs, the main part of the country affected by the epidemic.\n\nOn June 15 the first death was announced: a three-month-old baby in the Greater Buenos Aires area. In the second half of June, coinciding with the onset of winter, the virus was widely transmitted in Buenos Aires and spread to other parts of the country, especially the Province of Santa Fe, with its center in the city of Rosario.\n\nOn June 29, the Government decided to close schools throughout the month of July, a measure which affected 11 million students. Pregnant women and other categories at risk were also dispensed from working. The measures taken by the authorities were primarily targeted to limit contagion during the winter months until the start of spring.\n\nThe peak of infection lasted from the end of June until the beginning of July, increasing normal hospital demand fivefold and causing the collapse of the systems organizing hospital wards, home doctors and work place doctors. The most affected area was Greater Buenos Aires, home to some 12 million people. It was estimated that up to 10% of the population of that region (approximately 1,200,000 people) could be affected by the pandemic of influenza A.\n\nIn Argentina, seasonal flu outbreaks kill about 4,000 people each year, equivalent to a rate of 10 deaths per 100,000 inhabitants. The contingency plan developed in 2006 to face a possible influenza pandemic estimated that the dead could reach 13,000 in the event of a moderate rate of infection (15%) and 30,000 in the event of a serious infection rate (35%).\n\nApril 26:\nThe Ministry of Health issued an Epidemic Alert order asking airlines to report passengers with influenza symptoms arriving from Mexico and United States. The government also stepped up safety checks, and thermal scanners were used in airports to detect passengers running fevers.\n\nApril 28:\nThe Argentine government suspended all flights originating in Mexico until May 15 as a precautionary measure.\nThe first flight coming from Mexico arrived at Ezeiza International Airport on May 20.\n\nMay 1:\nThe Argentine government sent charter flights to Mexico to pick up all Argentine tourists abroad who wished to return.\n\nMay 7:\nThe first case of Influenza A (H1N1) was confirmed in the country, a tourist who had recently returned from Mexico. This man was from Puerto Madryn, Chubut Province.\n\nMay 22:\nHealth Authorities confirmed the second case, a woman who had arrived from the United States about 20 days before.\n\nJune 25:\nA case of human-to-swine transmission was discovered in Buenos Aires province. The hog farm where it occurred was interdicted. This was the second known case of reverse-zoonosis in the world.\n\nJune 28:\nDue to the ongoing legislative elections and the possible resignation of the Health Minister, Graciela Ocaña, reports of confirmed cases and deaths were suspended.\n\nJune 29:\nArgentina's Health Minister, Graciela Ocaña, announced her resignation due to some political instability in the country and stated that the current government did not support her on some projects and plans she recommended for the betterment of the country. The Provinces of Santa Fe (after confirming the first two deaths), San Luis (with 5 confirmed cases and more than 30 suspected cases) and Santiago del Estero (which on the same day confirmed 12 cases of swine flu) each decided to suspend all classes of elementary, primary and secondary schools, and recommended that the universities adopt the same procedure.\n\nJune 30:\nThe government of the Autonomous City of Buenos Aires alongside the government of the Buenos Aires province, decreed a \"Health Emergency\", though public services continued their operations. Winter holidays for students had started two weeks before.\n\nJuly 2:\nThe newly appointed Health Minister Juan Luis Manzur estimated the number of affected people to be as high as 100,000, as well as 44 confirmed deaths.\n\nJuly 14:\nThe number of officially recognised cases skyrocketed, with 137 deaths, making the death toll in Argentina the second highest in the world, only behind the United States and surpassing confirmed cases in Mexico.\n\nJuly 28:\nImpact on health services diminished significantly according to various specialists, though the death toll continued to increase, partly because of the delay in confirming previous fatalities. There had been no official report by the national Health Ministry since July 14.\n\nJuly 30:\nOfficial reports of confirmed deaths from the provinces put the death toll around 260, while \"Critica\" newspaper published an interview with Jorge Yabkowski, president of the Sindical Federation of Health Professionals of Argentina (Fesprosa), giving an estimate death toll from H1N1 flu of above 400 (while USA was at 340), based on the false death count in Buenos Aires, where many patients may have \"entered the hospitals almost dead and were not tested for H1N1\".\n\nAugust 3:\nThe students returned to schools in all except 3 provinces, while awaiting a possible second wave. The estimated cumulative number of H1N1 cases was more than 400,000 Argentinians.\n\nAugust 5:\nA new report was released by the ministry of health, showing 762,711 ILI cases up to Aug 1, 2009, of which more than 700,000 were of the A (H1N1) swine flu type. Only 47% of the 337 confirmed H1N1 flu deaths had a history of chronic disease or any other risk factor. Additionally, 402 deaths were in the process of being confirmed, whereas the number of cases began to decrease in 18 of the 24 provinces.\n\nAugust 14: Further decrease in activity levels. Official death count: 404.\n\nAugust 24:\nIndicators showed a decreasing activity tendency, while intensity was still high. The impact on health services returned to low, and most provinces had no recent deaths. The official death count was 439.\n\nAugust 29:\nWeek 32 saw no further decrease in new ILI cases, reaching 818,031 cumulative cases. Confirmed deaths: 465, deaths under study: 349.\n\nSeptember 7: ILI cases reported up to week 33: 1,054,707.

{"id": "53458418", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=53458418", "title": "AIDS Memoir Quartet", "text": "AIDS Memoir Quartet\n\nString Quartet: An AIDS Activist's Memoir in Music, commonly abbreviated to AIDS Memoir Quartet, is a musical composition by composer Lyle Chan which premiered in 2014. The work has been exclusively performed by the Acacia Quartet.\n\nThe work chronicles Chan's 6 years as an HIV/AIDS activist at the height of the epidemic in Australia, including importing experimental medications from Los Angeles to Sydney. It is the longest string quartet ever written in Australia\n\nThe 90-minute work was sketched in the during the years 1991-1996, but only completed some 20 years later. It contains reflections of historic events, portraits of famous activist friends now dead, and unusual effects like the use of police whistles to recall street demonstrations by ACT UP, the direct action protest group of which Lyle Chan was a core member. In those crisis years, he and fellow activists couriered AIDS treatments from the US that were unavailable in Australia, fiercely lobbied federal government to approve experimental treatments more quickly, and collaborated with drug companies to design clinical trials of promising new treatments.\n\nThe Melbourne Recital Centre, one of the first presenters of the work, states, \"This work tells the story of how activists transformed a stigmatized, fatal disease. Like the autobiographical quartets of Steve Reich or Shostakovich, Lyle Chan's AIDS memoir is in turn harrowing and touching but ultimately an intensely uplifting story of a community that fought against all odds for their lives and won.\"\n\n\"Activism is an attempt to reach some kind of normality\", he reflected in a 2014 interview, \"that you feel is being denied for some reason. Once it became clear, between 1994 and 1996, that we were no longer fighting against a constant backdrop of death, it became possible to imagine a future where every day was not a state of emergency.\"\n\nAsked about the message of the work, he replied, \"I don't have an overt 'message', aside from the message that we all should bring beauty into the world, in our deeds and in our relationships. Sometimes, there are obstacles to be overcome in order to do that. For two decades, AIDS was one such obstacle to beauty and love.\"\n\nA typical complete performance lasts 2 hours, without interval. In performance, Lyle Chan speaks onstage between sections of the music – a narrative entirely from memory, telling vivid stories about the events and people of this era.\nThe work is made up of 17 sections played continuously, lasting approximately 90 minutes. In performances where the composer narrates between sets of music, the entire show lasts 2 hours without any breaks. It is the longest string quartet ever written in Australia.\n\nOrganised by the presenter Music By The Sea, the world premiere performance of the entire work took place on 5 July 2014 at the Sandgate Town Hall in Brisbane, Australia.\n\nThe Sydney premiere occurred on 18 July of the same year, organised by the Australian Broadcasting Corporation as a live broadcast concert from its Eugene Goossens Hall in Ultimo. Preceding the performance, ABC Classic FM's presenter Julian Day interviewed the composer on air amid breaking news that Malaysian Airlines flight MH17 had been shot down over the Ukraine while carrying passengers destined for the 20th International AIDS Conference that was to be held in Melbourne only a few days later. The performance was dedicated to those killed on Flight MH17 and their loved ones. At the time of the broadcast, a large number of international media reports claimed that over 100 of the passengers were conference delegates. It was subsequently confirmed that the true number of conference delegates on the flight was 6, but it included the scientist Dr Joep Lange, known for his pioneering research on combination therapy to treat HIV infection.\n\nMelbourne Recital Centre organised a complete performance in conjunction with the 20th International AIDS Conference on 23 July 2014.\n\nThe North American premiere took place on 22 June 2016 in Vancouver, Canada, at the invitation of Pride In Art Society for its annual Queer Arts Festival.\n\nOther notable performances\n\nAlong with \"Dextran Man, Part 1\", the 14-minute section \"Don't Leave Me This Way\" was performed at the National Gallery of Victoria's exhibition \"When This You See Remember Me\", a retrospective of the work of artist David McDiarmid. This section relates to the underground drug trials that Chan helped organise and in particular tells the story of how the experimental lipid amphotericin was obtained to treat McDiarmid's lymphoma. Chan was one of McDiarmid's medical carers in the year leading to the artist's death from AIDS-related complications in May 1995. The performance was preceded by a 40-minute conversation between the composer and Justice Michael Kirby on stage.\n\nSeveral excerpts were performed by Acacia Quartet on the Global Village stage of the 2014 International AIDS conference.\n\nThe Quartet has met with widespread critical and audience acclaim.\n\nIn its review, The Age described the work as \"triumphantly articulating a story of humanity amid the gloom of disaster … sometimes words can fail to adequately describe what one witnesses.\"\n\nLimelight Magazine called it \"A crushingly powerful work of musical history … A towering piece.\"\n\nSBS newscaster Anton Enus wrote in his personal Twitter account: \"Impressive, admirable, so very moving.\"\n\nRenowned American composer John Corigliano said, \"Lyle Chan's string quartet is a very ambitious work born out of a seemingly endless plague. Its composer has taken his experiences of living through the enormous tragedy of AIDS and from them has molded a serious and deeply felt work of art.\"\n\nThe work was the subject of a half-page feature article in The Australian.\n\nIn December 2015, LA Weekly contacted Lyle Chan to obtain permission to quote the \"AIDS Memoir Quartet\"'s program notes about Jim Corti (the real identity of 'Dextran Man' referred to in the music), stating \"Chan's post is a fascinating chronicle of what people were willing to do to be of service to a cause, including manufacturing caplets of ddC (\"the most illegal thing Jim had ever done\") when the FDA refused to approve it and the pharmaceutical companies refused to expand clinical trials. In a second post, Chan recalls when the supply of ddC was interrupted by the '92 L.A. riots — Corti, who was white, lived in South Central.\"\n"}

Its sole mission is to raise the funds and awareness necessary to operate and maintain St. Jude. \nALSAC is the largest healthcare related charity in the United States. The National Executive Office is located in Memphis, Tennessee. ALSAC also has over 30 local fundraising offices located in cities throughout the United States that hold over 30,000 fundraising events annually.\n\nAs of 2017, St. Jude Children's Research Hospital requires more than $2.4 million in operating costs each day, and public contributions provide more than 75 percent of the funds necessary to operate the hospital. Only 14% of the money to operate the hospital comes from insurance recoveries and 9% comes from grants.\n\nTo cover these costs, ALSAC has been raising more than $1 billion annually for the hospital through its more than 30,000 fund-raising activities. These include the FedEx St. Jude Classic, which is a PGA Tour event and one of the most visible fund-raising events for the hospital. Other fund-raising programs include the St. Jude Math-A-Thon, Up 'til Dawn, direct mailings, radiothons and television marketing. \n\nSt. Jude also has a merchandise catalog called the Hope Catalog. The catalog contains everything from shirts to office items, and from patient art to \"Give Thanks\" wristbands. \n\nOne of the hospital's most recent and successful fund-raising efforts has been the Dream Home Giveaway. The giveaway allows contest entrants to reserve tickets for $100 each to qualify to win homes valued up to $500,000. The Dream Home Giveaway, one of the largest national fund-raising programs, is conducted in cities across the United States. \n\nIn November 2004, St. Jude launched its inaugural Thanks and Giving campaign which encourages consumers to help raise funds at participating retailers by adding a donation at checkout or by purchasing specialty items to benefit St. Jude. The campaign is supported by network television spots, advertisements in major publications, featured content on the TODAY show, interactive marketing on AOL and a movie trailer that runs on 20,000 screens nationwide.

Since 1972, ESA has raised more than $200 million for St. Jude.\n\nFrom 2013 to 2016, 81 cents of every dollar received has supported the research and treatment at St. Jude. In FY2016, 72% of ALSAC and St. Jude expenses were allocated to program services (33.3% patient care, 30.8% research, 7.5% education and training).\n\nThe above statement conflates ALSAC and St. Jude, however. More precisely, as a separate entity, ALSAC's FY2016 IRS Form 990 for FYE 6/30/2016 shows that of the $1.156 billion of Fundraising Revenue (that is, not including investment returns from the nearly $4.0 billion \"Fund\" that ALSAC has accumulated), only $807 million was granted to the St. Jude Hospital. This represents only 69.8% of Fundraising Revenue to St. Jude for FY2016 (FYE 6/30/2016). Total ALSAC Revenue for FY2016 (FYE 6/30/2016) was $1.260 billion; this includes Fundraising Revenue of $1.156 billion, Investment Returns of $104 million, and Other Revenue of $26 million.

It is used as a visual prosthesis to improve the vision of people with severe cases of retinitis pigmentosa. The Argus II version of the system was approved for marketing in the European Union in March 2011, and it received approval in the US in February 2013 under a humanitarian device exemption. The Argus II system costs about US$150,000, excluding the cost of the implantation surgery and training to learn to use the device.\n\nThe Argus II is specifically designed to treat people with retinitis pigmentosa. The device was approved with data from a single-arm clinical trial that enrolled thirty people with severe retinitis pigmentosa; the longest follow-up on a trial subject was 38.3 months. People in the trial received the implant in only one eye and tests were conducted with the device switched on, or switched off as a control. With the device switched on, about 23% of the subjects had improvements in their ability to see; all had been at 2.9 or higher on the LogMAR scale and improvements ranged from just under 2.9 to 1.6 LogMAR – the equivalent of 20/1262 reading ability. 96% of the subjects were better able to identify a white square on a black computer screen; 57% were more able to determine the direction in which a white bar moved across a black computer screen. With the device switched on, about 60% were able to accurately walk to a door that was 20 feet away, as opposed to only 5% with the device switched off; 93% had no change in their perception of light.\n\nAmong the thirty subjects in the clinical trial, there were nine serious adverse events recorded, including lower than normal intraocular pressure, erosion of the conjunctiva, reopening of the surgical wound, inflammation inside the eye, and retinal detachments. There is also a risk of bacterial infection from the implanted cables that connect the implant to the signal processor.\n\nThe implantation procedure takes several hours, with the person receiving the implant under general anaesthesia. The surgeon removes the vitreous humor and any membranes on the retina where the implant will be placed. The implant is attached to the surface of the retina with a tack. The cables connecting the implant to the processor are run through the pars plana, a region near where the iris and sclera touch.\n\nThe Argus implant's primary external element is a digital camera mounted on eyeglass frames, which obtains images of the user's surroundings; signals from the camera are transmitted wirelessly to a computerised image processor. The processor is in turn connected by cables to the implant itself, which is surgically implanted on the surface of the person's retina and tacked into place. The implant consists of 60 electrodes, each 200 microns in diameter.\n\nThe implant's manufacturer, Second Sight Medical Products, was founded in Sylmar, California, in 1998, by Alfred Mann, Samuel Williams, and Gunnar Bjorg. Williams, an investor in a cochlear implant company operated by Mann, approached Mann about founding a company to develop a similar product for the eye, and Mann called a meeting with the two of them and Robert Greenberg, who worked at Mann's foundation. Greenberg had previously worked on retinal prosthetics as a graduate student at Johns Hopkins University, and was appointed as CEO of the new company when it was launched. The first version of the prosthesis, the Argus I, was clinically tested on six people starting in 2002. The second version, the Argus II, was designed to be smaller and easier to implant, and was co-invented by Mark Humayun of the USC Eye Institute, who had been involved in the clinical testing of the Argus I. The Argus II was first tested in Mexico in 2006, and then a 30-person clinical trial was conducted in 10 medical centers across Europe and the United States.\n\nThe Argus II received approval for commercial use in the European Union in March 2011. In February 2013, the FDA approved the Argus II under a humanitarian device exemption, authorizing its use for up to 4,000 people in the US per year.\n\nThe Argus II was initially available at a limited number of clinics in France, Germany, Italy, the Netherlands, the United Kingdom and Saudi Arabia, at an EU market price of US$115,000. When the Argus II launched in the United States in February 2013, Second Sight announced that it would be priced at around $150,000, excluding the cost of surgery and usage training. In August 2013, Second Sight announced that reimbursement payments had been approved for the Argus II for blind Medicare recipients in the United States.\n\nA trial in England funded by NHS England for ten patients began in 2017.\n\n\n"}

Next the nerve cells in the feet send information, providing feedback to the brain, enabling it to adjust the muscle groups or amount of force required to walk across the ground. Different amounts of force are applied depending on the type of surface being walked across. The leg's muscle spindle nerve cells then sense and send the position of the floor back up to the brain. Finally, when the foot is raised to step, signals are sent to muscles in the leg and foot to set it down.\n\nBiosensors are used to detect what the user wants to do or their intentions and motions. In some devices the information can be relayed by the user's nervous system or muscle system. This information is related by the biosensor to a controller which can be located inside or outside the biomechatronic device. In addition biosensors receive information about the limb position and force from the limb and actuator. Biosensors come in a variety of forms. They can be wires which detect electrical activity, needle electrodes implanted in muscles, and electrode arrays with nerves growing through them.\n\nThe purpose of the mechanical sensors is to measure information about the biomechatronic device and relate that information to the biosensor or controller.\n\nThe controller in a biomechatronic device relays the user's intentions to the actuators. It also interprets feedback information to the user that comes from the biosensors and mechanical sensors. The other function of the controller is to control the biomechatronic device's movements.\n\nThe actuator is an artificial muscle. Its job is to produce force and movement. Depending on whether the device is orthotic or prosthetic the actuator can be a motor that assists or replaces the user's original muscle.\n\nBiomechatronics is a rapidly growing field but as of now there are very few labs which conduct research. The Rehabilitation Institute of Chicago, University of California at Berkeley, MIT, and University of Twente in the Netherlands are the researching leaders in biomechatronics. Three main areas are emphasized in the current research.\n\nA great deal of analysis over human motion is needed because human movement is very complex. MIT and the University of Twente are both working to analyze these movements. They are doing this through a combination of computer models, camera systems, and electromyograms.\n\nInterfacing allows biomechatronics devices to connect with the muscle systems and nerves of the user in order send and receive information from the device. This is a technology that is not available in ordinary orthotics and prosthetics devices. Groups at the University of Twente and University of Malaya are making drastic steps in this department. Scientists there have developed a device which will help to treat paralysis and stroke victims who are unable to control their foot while walking. The researchers are also nearing a breakthrough which would allow a person with an amputated leg to control their prosthetic leg through their stump muscles.\n\nHugh Herr is the leading biomechatronic scientist at MIT. Herr and his group of researchers are developing a sieve integrated circuit electrode and prosthetic devices that are coming closer to mimicking real human movement. The two prosthetic devices currently in the making will control knee movement and the other will control the stiffness of an ankle joint.\n\nAs mentioned before Herr and his colleagues made a robotic fish that was propelled by living muscle tissue taken from frog legs. The robotic fish was a prototype of a biomechatronic device with a living actuator. The following characteristics were given to the fish. \n\nNew media artists at UCSD are using biomechatronics in performance art pieces, such as Technesexual (more information, photos, video), a performance which uses biometric sensors to bridge the performers' real bodies to their Second Life avatars and Slapshock (more information, photos,video), in which medical TENS units are used to explore intersubjective symbiosis in intimate relationships.\n\nThe demand for biomechatronic devices are at an all-time high and show no signs of slowing down. With increasing technological advancement in recent years, biomechatronic researchers have been able to construct prosthetic limbs that are capable of replicating the functionality of human appendages. Such devices include the \"i-limb\", developed by prosthetic company Touch Bionics, the first fully functioning prosthetic hand with articulating joints, as well as Herr's PowerFoot BiOM, the first prosthetic leg capable of simulating muscle and tendon processes within the human body. Biomechatronic research has also helped further research towards understanding human functions. Researchers from Carnegie Mellon and North Carolina State have created an exoskeleton that decreases the metabolic cost of walking by around 7 percent.\n\nMany biomechatronic researchers are closely collaborating with military organizations. The US Department of Veterans Affairs and the Department of Defense are giving funds to different labs to help soldiers and war veterans.\n\nDespite the demand, however, biomechatronic technologies struggle within the healthcare market due to high costs and lack of implementation into insurance policies. Herr claims that Medicare and Medicaid specifically are important \"market-breakers or market-makers for all these technologies,\" and that the technologies will not be available to everyone until the technologies get a breakthrough. Biomechatronic devices, although improved, also still face mechanical obstructions, suffering from inadequate battery power, consistent mechanical reliability, and neural connections between prosthetics and the human body.\n\n"}

It has the mission of promoting the development and the interchange of ideas and results in the fields devoted to the information technologies applied to the health sciences (Medical informatics, Telemedicine, Bioinformatics, etc.).\n\nSBIS is a nonprofit membership organization of individuals and institutions interested in developing and using information technologies to improve health care in Brazil. To accomplish its goal, SBIS may develop the following activities:\n\nSome of SBIS areas of interest are:\n\n\nCurrently it has around 780 associates, thus being the third largest in the Americas, after the American Medical Informatics Association and the Canada's Health Informatics Association, and the largest in Latin America, according to the International Medical Informatics Association. The Society is affiliated to the International Medical Informatics Association since 1988.\n\nThe current Executive Board (2008–2010) is led by Dr. Cláudio Giulliano Alves da Costa (President). Former presidents were: Roberto J. Rodrigues, Renato M.E. Sabbatini, Mariza Machado Klück, Beatriz de Faria Leão, Daniel Sigulem, Umberto Tachinardi, Lincoln de Assis Moura Jr. and Heimar de Fátima Marin. Short histories of Health Informatics in Brazil have been published elsewhere by former presidents of the Society.\n\nSBIS organizes since 1986 a biannual national conference, the Brazilian Congress of Health Informatics and a biannual specialized conference on Electronic Health Records (PEP); besides other, smaller and less periodical meetings.\n\nThe Brazilian Congress on Health Informatics takes place in different cities every two years and has as its main subjects the applications of information technology and telematics to medicine, nursing, dentistry and allied health care sciences, from the point of view of the expert scientific and technical worker in these areas. The first conference was organized in November 1986, in the city of Campinas by Dr. Renato M.E. Sabbatini. The vice-president was Dr. Hugo Sabatino, and the editor-in-chief of the Conference's proceedings was Dr. Renato G.G. Terzi, all with the Medical School at the same university. During this conference, the Brazilian Society of Health Informatics was launched, as well as the \"Brazilian Journal of Health Informatics\". The conference was then repeated in 1988 (São Paulo), 1990, 1992, 1994, 1996 (Campos do Jordão), 1998, 2000, 2002, 2004 (Natal), 2006 (Florianópolis) and 2008 (Campos do Jordão). The next conference will be held in November 2010, in Porto de Galinhas, Pernambuco.\n\nSBIS' flagship periodical is the on-line scientific journal, \"Journal of Health Informatics\" (Heimar Marin, Editor-in-Chief). It also publishes \"SBIS News\", an electronic bulletin hosted by Yahoo! Groups (Renato M.E. Sabbatini, editor-in-chief), and coordinates the SBIS-L e-mail discussion list.\n\nIn collaboration with the Brazilian Federal Council of Medicine since 2007, SBIS has developed one of few programs in the developing world geared towards the software certification in the area of electronic health records. The standards for access, information security, digital certification, patient confidentiality, storage of records, etc., have been discussed together and officially approved by a number of decrees enforced by CFM and are part now of a Manual, a course for buildup of a task force of specialized consultants. The certification standards cover ambulatory healthcare, clinical laboratory and other areas, and in the future will be expanded for inpatient health records and Picture archiving and communication system.\n\nIn 2008 the Society approved the creation of a new initiative and a directorship to boost educational activities in health informatics. A website and a Learning Management System based on Moodle server were created in 2009 (address ). The site is used to support presential courses as well as to offer purely distance courses, seminars, lectures, and other educational activities. The site has also a digital library with on-line references to papers, reviews, e-books, multimedia files, etc., which are deemed useful for education and learning purposes. In addition, webconferencing facilities using DimDim have been added and can be used by associated individuals and institutions.\n\nIn October 2009 the Society launched a program for certificating health care professionals as specialists, in a manner similar to medical specialties coordinated by the Brazilian Medical Association and the Federal Council of Medicine in Brazil. The program entails a minimum list of technical proficiency, a written and oral annual examination, and the issue of a certificate which is valid for five years. The revalidation of the certificate will be mandatory by means of continuing education credits. The Society installed also an educational accreditation program in place, for recognizing courses and curricula in health informatics, for this purpose, with a point-based system of credits. The entire program is under the responsibility of a new Directorship of Professional Education, coordinated by Prof. Renato M.E. Sabbatini.\n\n"}

CAAF accomplishes its mission to help HIV-impacted children domestically and abroad through four district programs.\n\nThe mission of the Children Affected by AIDS Foundation (CAAF) is to make a positive difference in the lives of children infected with HIV and affected by AIDS. CAAF accomplishes this by helping meet their diverse special needs, advocating and educating on their behalf, and bringing joy and fun into their lives.\n\n\nIn collaboration with a local partner, the foundation has implemented its Prevention by Intervention initiative in 22 healthcare sites in Guatemala. The initiative is increasing HIV awareness, access to HIV pre and post test counseling for pregnant woman and rapid HIV testing to prevent children from being born with the virus. As a result, Prevention by Intervention is decreasing the rates of mother to child transmission of HIV and, consequently AIDS orphanhood in Guatemala.\n\nAfter entering the Latin American and Caribbean (LAC) region in 2005, CAAF has spread throughout the region and touched the lives of more than 28,000 children in 2008. CAAF has worked in Brazil to accelerate adoption procedures and offer legal aid to families adopting AIDS-orphaned children. Food was supplied and psychological support services were provided for Argentinean families affected by AIDS. In Peru, CAAF engaged healthcare workers, families, and children to promote medication adherence, among other programs.\n\nCAAF's international efforts have given funds to 31 nonprofits to support care, stability and well-being of Latin American and Caribbean children who are infected, affected or orphaned by HIV/AIDS.\n\nThe Foundation's premiere fundraising effort is Dream Halloween, kid-friendly costume parties held in October in Chicago, Los Angeles and New York.\n\nWhat is Dream Halloween? Since 1993, The Children Affected by AIDS Foundation has raised millions through its\nnationally recognized Dream Halloween special events. These events were created for a very special reason – to provide children with a safe, secure opportunity to enjoy Halloween through an experience that goes far beyond a child’s imagination. The goal of the events is to create an experience that exemplifies what every child would dream of when celebrating Halloween.\n\nNow, Dream Halloween is a unique national awareness and fundraising campaign launched annually in October to expand the efforts of the foundation. Incorporating the signature events with corporate cause\nmarketing efforts, a full media campaign and innovative new fundraising initiatives, Dream Halloween will highlight the unique work of the foundation and provide new opportunities to support the mission of the organization. The nation will be invited to join the campaign and dream…Dream of a day when all children living\nwith HIV/AIDS are living happy and healthy lives. Dream of a day without HIV/AIDS. Dream of a day when all children are safe and free from harm.\n\nComedy, laughter and hope! This is the foundation for CAAF’s A Night of Comedy annual event. Long time CAAF supporter, Doris Roberts hosts the event and Ray Romano serves as Master of Ceremonies. Past years have seen the likes of comedians such as Chris Rock, Kevin James, David Spade, Sarah Silverman, Drew Carey, Kathy Griffin, George Lopez, Lily Tomlin, Garry Shandling, Wayne Brady, Bryan Callen…the list goes on.\n\nIn addition to its major events, the Foundation accepts donations year-round on its Web site and by other means.\n\nAs a Mattel, Inc. executive, Joe Cristina’s professional life has centered on children for more than 22 years. In 1993, Joe was faced with a dilemma—his health had been deteriorating due to HIV, he had lost two life partners to AIDS, and he was contemplating a quiet disability leave.\n\nBut his boss, Jill Barad (then President of Mattel), proposed instead to Joe that he take a few weeks off to think about what he wanted to do with the rest of his life and trust that his friends and business colleagues would be there to support him. Joe decided to publicly disclose his HIV+ status, and he was overwhelmed by the enormous outpouring of support he received. The response from everyone was the same: “What can I do to help?”\n\nJoe realized that he was being faced with a once in a lifetime opportunity to help make a difference in the world. The encouragement and support that he received from those at Mattel and throughout the children’s industry inspired him. That inspiration, along with an improvement in his health due to the advent of “HIV cocktail therapy”, convinced him to stay at Mattel and find a way to mobilize this network of diverse resources to make a positive difference in the lives of children affected by HIV/AIDS. Hence, the Children Affected by AIDS Foundation was born. Through Joe’s vision and leadership, the Foundation has raised more than $33 million since its inception. In 2007, Joe’s health again began to falter due to the long-term effects of HIV coupled with medication side effects, and it became necessary for him to go on an extended medical leave from Mattel. Joe now focuses all of his time and energy on taking care of his health and continuing to help children affected by HIV/AIDS. Mattel, Inc. continues to provide major funding and support to the Foundation.\n\nJoe Cristina currently serves as the Board Chair for CAAF.\n\nCAAF has a staff of 7 led by President Catherine Brown. The group has its headquarters in Los Angeles and maintains a satellite office in Chicago.\n\nCAAF Web site\n"}

Cohiba is the Cuban Indians' name for tobacco.\n\nProduction of Cohiba cigarettes began in 1987 in Cuba as a joint venture between Habanos, S.A. and Cita Tobaccos de Canarias, S.L..

It stars Dick Van Dyke plus a long list of comedic actors. The film was directed, co-produced and co-written by Norman Lear and is based on the unpublished novel \"I'm Giving Them Up for Good\" by Margaret and Neil Rau.\n\nThe film was made in 1969, but was shelved for two years by the distributor due to concerns about its box-office potential.\n\nA musical theatre version of \"Cold Turkey\" was workshopped at the Village Theatre in Issaquah, Washington in February 2005.\n\nAs part of a public relations and marketing strategy to compare the empathy of Big Tobacco to the nobility of the Nobel Peace Prize, advertising executive Merwin Wren convinces the Valiant Tobacco Company to propose a challenge: a tax-free check for $25,000,000 ($ million today) to any city or town in America that can stop smoking, going cold turkey, for thirty days.\n\nAccording to Wren, the offer will generate Valiant worldwide free publicity and praise as a humanitarian gesture, but no town in America would ever be able to claim the prize, with cigarette smoking being too addictive to stop.\n\nThe Reverend Clayton Brooks, a kindly but fearsome minister of the Eagle Rock Community Church, takes up the challenge as a spiritual call. He urges the economically depressed (fictional) community of Eagle Rock, Iowa, population 4,006, to go for the prize.\n\nThe town council has been trying to woo back the military ever since it closed a base a few years earlier, hoping its return would help the local cash flow. Families have been moving out almost on a monthly basis and the town center is almost deserted.\n\nReverend Brooks recruits every smoker in the town to sign up. Needled for being a former smoker, he begins smoking again to find solidarity with his \"flock.\"\n\nAs the deadline to start the thirty-day clock approaches, only a very few of the town's residents haven't signed the no smoking pledge. One of them is alcoholic Edgar Stopworth, who Reverend Brooks decides to pay a house call on, to convince him to take the pledge. But Edgar knows himself pretty well and in desperation tells the Reverend \"My drinking is directly connected to my smoking. The booze bone's connected to the smoke bone.\" The Reverend looks defeated but comes up with the idea of Edgar leaving town for a thirty-day vacation, which Edgar immediately departs on. Problem solved.\n\nAt midnight, the challenge begins. For the next thirty days, no smoking is permitted, with Eagle Rock being the only city in America that got all of its smokers to pledge.\n\nOnce the no smoking ban begins, Reverend Brooks gets extremely frustrated with not being able to smoke. His only relief is having frequent sex with his wife Natalie. At one point she barely gets finished making the bed and straightening up from the preceding episode before the Reverend is back home again for more.\n\nThe tobacco company sends Merwin to report the progress of the townspeople's commitment. The company needs just one person to fail. Among the weakest: the elderly Doctor Proctor, who must always have a cigarette before surgery, and the anxiety-ridden wife of the mayor, Mrs. Wappler, who counts the small gherkin pickles she eats as the hours pass. However, a group of 29 non-smoking residents, all members of the ultra-conservative Christopher Mott Society (based on the John Birch Society) have been asked by Brooks to police all traffic entering Eagle Rock to ensure no tobacco products enter.\n\nEventually, the attention of the nation's leading newscasters at the time (all played by the comedy duo Bob and Ray), turns the small community's efforts into a matter of highly publicized failure or success. Soon the community is invaded by buxom \"massage therapists,\" beer vendors, souvenir shops and more. Rev. Brooks appears on a \"Time\" magazine cover, which leads him to another epiphany: if he can save the town, he will be a hero.\n\nMerwin is told by Valiant's board members to undermine the town's efforts at all costs, doing whatever he must to get someone to smoke before the thirty days are up, which includes speeding up the large clock in the town center prior to the end of the 30 day deadline, in the hopes that people will be tricked into starting to smoke again before they are allowed to. \n\nUltimately Eagle Rock succeeds and wins the $25 million prize. To cash in on the publicity, The President Of The United States (as seen from the side and back, then President Richard M. Nixon) arrives in a motorcade and makes an announcement that Eagle Rock will be the home of the new missile plant. As the film ends, it shows the huge smokestacks of the new plant spewing volumes of black smoke into the air around Eagle Rock.\n\n\nMost of the film, which is set in the fictional small town of \"Eagle Rock, Iowa\", was shot in and around Greenfield, Iowa, and many local people were used as extras. Some neighborhood scenes were shot in Winterset, Iowa. The Methodist church in Orient, Iowa, and the bank in Macksburg, Iowa, were used as well. The Grayson Mansion scenes were filmed at Terrace Hill, official residence of the Governor of Iowa, located in Des Moines. Some were also shot in the town of Columbia in south central Kentucky.\n\n\"Cold Turkey\" features original music by Randy Newman, including \"He Gives Us All His Love\", a ballad with a gospel influence that serves as the film's theme song. This was Newman's first film soundtrack.\n\nIn 2007 the Percepto Records label issued a limited-edition soundtrack CD for the film.\n\nThe film earned $5.5 million in theatrical rentals at the North American box office.\n\nArthur Krim of United Artists later did an assessment of the film as part of an evaluation of the company's inventory:\nAn old commitment to Dick Van Dyke, and what seemed to be a good idea for the American market, became an overpriced film with a has-been personality by the time of it's [ sic ] release. Albeit funny, the picture is way overpriced for its value, which is strictly for the American market – mainly for mid America. The producer and director went over a million dollars over budget on the film to deliver a minor American comedy with no overseas value. This film would be programmed today only if it could be made at one-half the cost.\n\nVincent Canby of The New York Times wrote that \"it is, within its limitations, a very engaging, very funny movie.\" \"Variety\" called it \"an often-hilarious, partly-muffed contemporary comedy\" marred by \"sluggish pacing\" and a climax called \"bizarre: Lear seems to have written himself into a corner, with no way out except to shift abruptly from human comedy to stylistic nonsense.\" Roger Ebert gave it four stars and praised several aspects of the production before concluding \"Even if you don't smoke, you'll find Cold Turkey funny.\" Gene Siskel of \"The Chicago Tribune\" gave it two-and-a-half stars out of four, calling it \"a fine and funny idea for a short film,\" but \"scene after scene runs too long. Too many gags are repeated too often.\" Charles Champlin of the \"Los Angeles Times\" called it \"an enterprising, very amusing, very contemporary social commentary.\" Gary Arnold of \"The Washington Post\" wrote, \"A shallow, self-deluding sort of comedy, it fails to make sense out of its own premise and characters and then tries to cover up by getting cynical about everything-in-general. It's as if Lear had been inspired to imitate Billy Wilder at his worst.\"\n\nIn 1993 \"Cold Turkey\" was released on VHS and LaserDisc, in the pan-and-scan format. In 2010, the film was released on DVD through Amazon.com with manufacturing on demand.\n\n\n"}

Columbia Asia is one of the largest and fastest-growing healthcare companies in Asia and owned by an investment fund : International Columbia USA LLC (ICU). The Group started operations in 1997 with a simple goal to \"deliver accessible, quality, cost-effective specialist care to people where they live.\". However, the costing provided by the hospital services are considered to be much higher to the living standards of that area. Some even consider that the chain of hospitals are only catering for high-class citizen and not sticking to orignal motive.\nThe company offers full-service hospitals usually built in the suburbs, mostly where there are rich industrial belts, rather than the central city. Columbia Asia has a cluster strategy where multiple hospitals are grouped to complement each facility, providing accessibility in the community. Columbia Asia's target market is the fast-growing middle income group.\n\nColumbia Asia believes in setting up smaller hospitals; less than 200 beds; built in residential areas for accessibility and efficiency. A typical hospital has about 90-150 beds, costing roughly $30 million to build. Each hospital sees about sees about 8,000 - 15,000 patients a month, and brings in about $1-2 million in monthly revenue. All hospitals in the group have the standardized design, which gives the same look and feel throughout all geographies under one unified brand.\n\nMost of the company’s 12,000 employees are from the host countries. Columbia Asia hires its doctors and staff largely from the local areas.\n\nThe company is in the midst of expansion and upon completion of this phase the company will have 12 facilities in India, 14 facilities in Malaysia, 3 facilities in Vietnam and 3 faciliites in Indonesia, together representing an investment of over $600 million (U.S.).

Collaboratively, researchers and laypeople review potential vaccines for safety, immune response, and efficacy. The HVTN is a network for testing vaccines, and while its members may also work in vaccine development for other entities, the mission of the HVTN does not include vaccine design.\n\nThe HVTN is the only HIV vaccine research network sponsored by the American government. It also manages the only large-scale HIV vaccine research trial network in Africa. The HVTN collaborates with the Division of Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome (DAIDS). Funding comes from the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases and National Institutes of Health, which oversee DAIDS. HVTN is headquartered at the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center in Seattle. The vaccines being tested come from various producers, both commercial and non-profit.\n\nTypically, researchers conduct clinical research on human subjects by asking volunteers to give informed consent to participate in an experiment by taking drugs that have not always been proven safe or effective in humans, though their safety has been tested (usually in animals) prior to any human trials. At the HVTN, many current vaccine studies are using products with a safety record that has been established in previous human trials.\n\nThe Nuremberg Code, the Declaration of Helsinki, and the Belmont Report are legal documents written in layman's terms which local governments use to model their laws for establishing rules for conducting clinical trials, and all contemporary clinical trials of international worth follow all the rules set by these precedents.\n\nHowever, HIV vaccine research requires more than just these protections, and because of this, from the inception of their research the HVTN has instituted a \"community advisory board\" (CAB) system in addition to the usual controls. The CAB is similar to an Institutional Review Board (IRB) in that the researchers facilitate the granting of public data to both entities, but the difference is that the IRB consists of a professional ethics committee and the CAB consists of any community member who wants to supervise the safety, ethics, efficacy, or any other aspect of the research.\n\nThe researchers of the HVTN deemed the creation of the CAB necessary for HIV vaccine research when it has not been necessary for other clinical research because the HIV epidemic is especially urgent, new research techniques are available now that did not exist before recent major advances in genetic engineering, the public is generally overly-willing to volunteer to receive experimental vaccines for this cause, and yet the educational infrastructure already in place to disseminate information about the inherent risk in participating in vaccine research is lacking in society. For too many reasons, there is no precedent for research of this sort on this scale, and without integrating educational programs about this research into existing community institutions, the HVTN simply could not educate people to the required level to make such a fast-moving, expensive, inherently non-commercial research project possible.\n\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "30071593", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=30071593", "title": "Jefferson Fish", "text": "Jefferson Fish\n\nJefferson Morris Fish is a professor emeritus of psychology at St. John's University in New York City, where he previously served as Chair of the Department of Psychology and as Director of the PhD Program in Clinical Psychology.\n\nFish was born in Manhattan, the grandson of Eastern European Jewish immigrants. After spending his internship year, 1966-1967, at the Langley Porter Neuropsychiatric Institute in San Francisco, he returned to New York to complete his studies during the Columbia riots. He received his PhD in clinical psychology from Columbia University and was a postdoctoral fellow at the State University of New York at Stony Brook.\n\nAlthough Fish had begun graduate school with the intention of becoming a psychoanalyst, he did a Rogerian PhD dissertation, followed by a postdoctoral program in behavior therapy. It was during his postdoctoral year that he developed his interests in hypnosis, placebo, and paradoxical interventions (also known as therapeutic double-binds)—leading ultimately to his involvement with family therapy. In his clinical books and articles Fish viewed therapy as a social influence process, and drew on social psychology, sociology and anthropology—-in addition to clinical psychology, psychiatry, and social work—-as sources for ideas and empirical evidence.\n\nAt Stony Brook, Fish met his wife, the African American anthropologist Dolores Newton, who had just returned from her second stint of field work with the Krikati Indians in Brazil. Married in 1970, the couple spent the years 1974-1976 as visiting professors in Brazil—including a month with the Krikati. It was there that Fish developed his interests in Brazil, languages, the relationship between psychology and anthropology, cross-cultural psychology, and the concept of race in different cultures. He contributed a panel comparing the concept of race in Brazil and the United States to the American Anthropological Association's exhibit \"Race: Are We So Different?\"\n\nFish is the author or editor of 12 books, and well over 100 journal articles, book chapters and other works. He is a Fellow of the American Psychological Association and of the Association for Psychological Science, and is board certified in Clinical Psychology and in Couple and Family Psychology by the American Board of Professional Psychology. He served in a variety of roles on local, national, and international psychology organizations and drug policy organizations, and on the editorial boards of eight psychology journals in the United States, Brazil, and India.\n\nFish has written widely on psychotherapy as a social influence process, on social and cultural factors in therapy, and on brief therapy—including brief behavioral, cognitive, strategic, systemic, and solution focused therapies, and on the use of hypnosis in brief therapy. In \"Placebo Therapy\", for example, Fish argued that stimulating the client's positive expectancy of change was a primary source of the effectiveness of therapy. Hence, rather than attempting to minimize or control for the placebo effect, therapy should be structured so as to\nmaximize it. Patrick Pentony's \"Models of Influence in Psychotherapy\" presented Fish's placebo model as one of only three models of influence underlying the numerous systems of psychotherapy. (The other two are the resocialization model and the contextual model). Fish's book also stimulated Irving Kirsch's research on response expectancy theory, in which people's experience—such as becoming calmer or happier—is affected by what they expect to experience.\n\nWithin cross-cultural psychology his writings have dealt mainly with comparing and contrasting the race concept in a variety of cultures, the race-IQ debate, and Brazil. Contrary to the folk view of race as a fixed biological phenomenon, Fish argues that people can change their race simply by traveling from one culture to another. What changes is not what they look like, or their genes, or ancestry, but rather the set of cultural categories (folk taxonomy) each culture uses to classify them. Fish's article \"Mixed Blood\", comparing the American and Brazilian conceptions of race, has been anthologized by various disciplines, including history and anthropology. Fish was a Fulbright Scholar in Brazil and China. He speaks Portuguese, French, Spanish, and German.\n\nFish has contrasted two causal models underlying drug policy. The current view is that drugs cause crime and corruption, and spread disease. As a result, drugs have been made illegal. Drug dealers have armed themselves to combat law enforcement, and an escalating arms race has ensued. Fish has argued that this model is fallacious, and has argued for an alternative model: Drug prohibition causes a black market, and the black market causes crime and corruption, and spreads disease. As a result, drug policy should be aimed at shrinking the black market. To achieve this aim, he has been active in bringing together multidisciplinary, international, and American sub-cultural perspectives on drug policy, and to promoting consideration of a wide range of policy alternatives to the War on Drugs. He has served as Adjunct Coordinator of the Committee on Drugs and the Law of the Association of the Bar of the City of New York; and his broadening the discussion of policy alternatives has influenced debates in legal and policy circles.\n\nSince his retirement in 2006, Fish has been involved in writing for a broader audience; and he has published in \"Psychology Today\", \"The Humanist\", \"The Independent Review\", and \"Newsday\". His Psychology Today blog is \"Looking in the Cultural Mirror\".\n\n\n"}

The illusion was discovered by Frederick Kingdom, Ali Yoonessi and Elena Gheorghiu at McGill University, and won first prize in the Best Illusion of the Year Contest 2007.\n\nThe authors suggest that the illusion occurs because of the way the visual system takes into account perspective. When two identical towers rise in parallel but are viewed from below, their corresponding outlines converge in the retinal image due to perspective. The visual system normally \"corrects\" for the perspective distortion and as a result perceives the towers correctly, i.e. as rising in parallel. However in the case of the two identical images of the Pisa tower, the corresponding outlines of the towers do not converge but run in parallel, and as a result the towers are perceived as non-parallel, i.e. as diverging. The illusion reveals that the visual system is obliged to treat the two images as part of the same scene, in other words as the \"Twin Towers of Pisa\".\n\nAlthough the Pisa tower demonstrates the illusion and provides a pun for its name, the illusion can be seen in any pair of (identical) images of a receding object.\n"}

The book is organized as a historical timeline of treatment development in the United States.\n\n\"Mad in America\" received positive reviews from the general public and mixed reviews from the medical community, which criticized some bias in sourcing but nonetheless acknowledged the need to address the critical questions raised by the book regarding modern psychiatry.\n\nPart One describes early treatments like a spinning chair which could reach 100 revolutions per minute, the Tranquilizer Chair which immobilized patients, and water therapies. Whitaker then describes moral treatment, dating back to 1793 and the French Revolution and established in the U.S. by Quakers in 1817, in which lay superintendents treated the mentally ill in small homes with great kindness and had good outcomes: About 35 to 80 percent of patients were discharged within a year, the majority of them cured. Pennsylvania Hospital reported that about 45 percent of patients were discharged as cured and 25 percent discharged as improved. In Worcester State Hospital, 35 percent were chronically ill or had died while mentally ill. Dr. George Wood, a visitor, reported in 1851:\n\nPart Two describes the rise of eugenics which did away with moral treatment in favor of forced sterilization of the mentally ill, and led to newly invigorated fields of psychiatry and neuroscience whose experts practiced insulin coma, metrazol convulsion, forced electroshock, and lobotomy.\n\nPart Three describes the invention of the neuroleptic drug chlorpromazine (Thorazine) by Rhône-Poulenc in France, and its purchase by Smith, Kline & French (today known as GlaxoSmithKline). The drug \"produced an effect similar to frontal lobotomy\", according to early reports by the company's lead investigator. Whitaker says that pharmaceutical advertising, articles published in the scientific literature, and stories in the media of \"miracle drugs\" transformed Thorazine into a \"healing\" drug.\n\nWhitaker says that marketing money from pharmaceutical companies began to flow to the American Medical Association in 1951, a year after Thorazine was synthesized, because of the Durham-Humphrey Amendment to the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act which \"greatly expanded the list of medications that could only be obtained with a doctor's prescription\".\n\nIn Part Three, Whitaker also describes the American (but not for example British) propensity to classify patients as \"schizophrenic\", as well as the error (confusion of schizophrenia with the yet-to-be-discovered encephalitis lethargica) in the original classification by Emil Kraepelin which psychiatry chose to not revisit and fix. Whitaker then describes three pathways that dopamine may take in the human brain, and quotes first-person accounts of the effects of antipsychotic drugs on individuals.\n\nHe calls a 1996 \"New York Times\" advertisement by a consortium of pharmaceutical companies a \"bald-faced lie\": the group sought to say that the cause of psychosis and schizophrenia is an abnormal dopamine level and that their drugs worked by altering the level of dopamine. Whitaker then criticizes some American studies, and points out the work of George Crane at the National Institute of Mental Health to get tardive dyskinesia recognized, and he contrasts the dosages that British doctors were comfortable in prescribing (300 milligrams per day of Thorazine) with what American psychiatrists prescribed (1,500 up to perhaps 5,000 milligrams per day).\n\nHe sees irony in the fact that \"The New York Times\" reported on Soviet forced use of neuroleptic drugs (which Florida Senator Edward Gurney called \"chemicals which convert human beings into vegetables\") in \"psychiatric jails\" but called the same drugs \"widely acknowledged to be effective\" when reporting on American schizophrenic patients.\n\nWhitaker describes the demise of modern-day moral treatment in a short history of Loren Mosher's Soteria Project, funded by the U.S. while Mosher was chief of schizophrenia at NIMH. He attributes the results in a World Health Organization 1979 study of outcomes for schizophrenia patients (which found better outcomes in undeveloped countries like India, Nigeria and Colombia than in developed countries like the United States, England, Denmark, Ireland, Russia, Czechoslovakia and Japan) to doctors in the developed world who maintained their patients on medications.\n\nHe then describes fifty years of American scientists doing experiments on schizoprenia patients: to intentionally exacerbate their symptoms and study the results. He compares the doctors' behavior, unfavorably, to 1947 after American trials of Nazi doctors ended in the Nuremberg Code for ethics in human experimentation.\n\nPart Four is Whitaker's description of drug trials for the newer atypical antipsychotics. He says that many of these trials were stacked in favor of the drug being proposed by eliminating the placebo, or by comparing multiple doses of the new drug against a single, very high dose of the old one. He says that the pharmaceutical companies and the press used their influence to make claims for these drugs (some claims that the Food and Drug Administration had explicitly asked them not to make). Risperidone and olanzapine, for example, were both claimed to have fewer side effects than the first generation of antipsychotics. Whitaker also tells the stories of patients whose deaths were caused by drug trials but were not mentioned to the public.\n\nWhitaker calls it a type of medical fraud that schizophrenics are told that they suffer from too much dopamine or serotonin activity and that drugs put these brain chemicals back in \"balance\". He writes, \"Little is known about what causes schizophrenia. Antipsychotic drugs do not fix any known brain abnormality, nor do they put brain chemistry back into balance. What they do is alter brain function in a manner that diminishes certain characteristic symptoms...\".\n\nRecognizing Whitaker for marshalling evidence, a reviewer writing for the \"Chicago Tribune\" thought his hopes for moral treatment were admirable but inadequate. Writers for \"The Baltimore Sun\" and \"In These Times\" both liked the book but wondered why the author didn't mention Thomas Szasz, a critic of psychiatry.\n\nClinical psychologist Claudia Bukszpan Rutherford acknowledged that though the author holds an extreme position, the book's insight into many of the problems of clinical psychiatry over the years has good points: \"While at times his lack of editorial restraint actually distracts from his message, and one may not agree with all of his arguments, his topic is a vital one that has needed to be raised for quite some time, and one which will hopefully be a catalyst for further discussion.\" \n\nThe book was also reviewed in \"JAMA\", where reviewer Daniel J. Luchins, MD, of the University of Chicago observed the review of scientific literature to be biased at times. Despite this, Luchins concluded the book was of value in highlighting social aspects of treatment in psychiatry.\n\nPhysician J. van Gijn, reviewing the book for the \"New England Journal of Medicine,\" writes that \"the book is more of an indictment than a historical account,\" and starts by pointing out that Whitaker \"virtually equates mental illness with schizophrenia; depression and other psychiatric disorders are mentioned only parenthetically.\" Van Gijn summarizes the pre-1950 coverage of the book without much commentary, but then criticizes the rest of the book. Specifically, he questions Whitaker's assertion that Kraepelin's schizophrenia patients in fact suffered from encephalitis lethargica. With regard to antipsychotic medication, van Gijn notes that \"Although there may be truth in the notion that dosages of antipsychotic drugs in the United States are higher than necessary, the author weakens his position by issuing continuous and unrelenting condemnations (for instance, “The Nuremberg Code doesn't apply here”), despite a dearth of evidence to support them.\" Van Gijn then describes Whitaker's attack on the dopamine hypothesis of schizophrenia as \"simplistic reasoning,\" and concludes that \"Although [Whitaker] is widely read on the subject, the facts are largely arranged to suit his prejudice, especially in the chapters on drug treatment. American psychiatric institutions may have their failings in the current management of patients with schizophrenia, but they deserve better critics.\"\n\nPsychologist Clare Mundell, PhD, writing for the \"Journal of the American Academy of Psychoanalysis and Dynamic Psychiatry\" said \"Mad in America\" \"should be required reading not only for mental health professionals, but also for those who still question whether profit has eclipsed patient care as the primary force in medicine in this country.\"\n\nDavid Pilgrim, writing \"News of scandal is a few decades too late\" for \"Times Higher Education,\" focuses on the book's shortcomings, saying, \"The semi-academic froth he generates distracts the reader from a legitimate outrage, which is not his alone. It was shared by many others well before 1998\" (the year Whitaker began writing on mental health).\n\nPhysician Larry S. Goldman wrote a critical review of the book in WebMD's \"Medscape Today\", claiming that Whitaker \"is ready to throw the baby out with the bath water\" because \"Mad in America\" fails to acknowledge any biological abnormalities in schizophrenia, while at the same conceding that Whitaker's argument is correct in the sense that the true causes of schizophrenia are not known. Goldman concludes that the \"overheated style\" of the book \"tends to undermine some of its more important points, such as the unhealthy symbiosis between the US pharmaceutical industry and much of the psychiatric research community and the ever-present miserliness of public mental healthcare systems.\"\n\nIn a rejoinder to Goldman's review, physician Nathaniel S. Lehrman disagrees with Goldman, and writes that \"Whitaker is right,\" and goes on to agree with the main points in the book, namely that antipsychotic drugs cause brain damage, that despite \"psychiatrically produced misconceptions,\" they \"do not fix any known brain abnormality nor do they put brain chemistry back into balance. What they do is alter brain functions in a manner that diminishes certain characteristic symptoms.\" Lehrman then writes that all the data accumulated on the neurobiology of schizophrenia \"has hardly helped patient care.\"\n\nLehrman later wrote in the official journal of the conservative political organization the Association of American Physicians and Surgeons, the \"Journal of American Physicians and Surgeons\" that \"Mad in America\" is \"perhaps the most important psychiatric book of the 21st century.\"\n\nChristian Perring, editor of \"Metapsychology Online Review\" and who was impressed by the book, wrote, \"Even though Whitaker himself could be accused of being overly critical of psychiatry, his argument against schizophrenia medication is cogent enough to urgently require an answer.\"\n\nE. Fuller Torrey writing for the Treatment Advocacy Center called it \"histrionic\" and \"deeply disappointing.\"\n\nPhysician Marcia Angell, MD, writing a two-part review for \"The New York Review of Books\" called this and similar books \"powerful indictments of the way psychiatry is now practiced,\" documenting \"the 'frenzy' of diagnosis, the overuse of drugs with sometimes devastating side effects, and widespread conflicts of interest.\"\n\n\n"}
{"id": "49289350", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=49289350", "title": "Medical Research Club", "text": "Medical Research Club\n\nThe London Medical Research Club is a society founded in 1891 composed of scientists and medical doctors carrying out research in all fields of medicine and related disciplines. The purpose of the club is to offer an informal venue in which members can confidentially share their opinion and ideas on different scientific and medical topics. Members include scientists who are working or have actively worked in medical research, in academic and biomedical research institutions or in biotech, largely, but not exclusively within the London-Oxford-Cambridge research triangle. Members of the club, many of whom are within the early years of their independent scientific career, meet five times per calendar year in different venues in London. Three guest speakers are invited by members to present their most recent work and these presentations offer the starting point for an open scientific discussion. Speakers may later be invited to join the club.\n\nThe foundation date of the London Medical Research Club coincides with that of the first recorded meeting on 1 July 1891. The meeting took place in the Theatre of the Conjoint Laboratories on the Victoria Embankment, and was attended by 15 people: Sims Woodhead (chair), Sidney Martin (provisional secretary), Edward Emanuel Klein, Victor Alexander Haden Horsley, William Dobinson Halliburton, Charles Smart Roy, Marc Amand Ruffer, Samuel George Shattock, Charles Sherrington, John Sutton, Frederick Walker Mott, John Wickenford Washbourn, Almroth Edward Wright, Charles Alfred Ballance, and William Hunter. It was during this meeting that the motion to found a Medical Research Club was presented and carried forward.\n\nA provisional list of rules had already been produced by an interim committee, and was reviewed by the members present at the first meeting. The second, third and fourth meetings of the club (on 8, 15 and 22 July 1891) focused on further discussion of the rules, which were finally considered point by point and approved at the fifth meeting (28 October 1891).\n\nThe first ordinary meeting of the Medical Research Club was held on Wednesday 18 November 1891, when the first two scientific papers were presented: \"The Influence of the Kidney on Tissue Metabolism\" by John Rose Bradford; and \"Concurrent Infection\" by Edward Emanuel Klein.\n\nBelow are some of the 31 original Rules, as first printed in 1891:\n\n1. This Society is called the Medical Research Club.\n\n2. The objects of the Club are the discussion, and, as far as possible, the demonstration of original work in General and Special Pathological Science, excluding purely clinical observation.\n\n3. The Club shall consist of not more than thirty-five members, all of whom shall be actively engaged in medical research.\n\n4. All communications to the Club shall be absolutely private. Any member who shall publish an account of the proceedings of the Club, shall, ipso facto, cease to be a member of the Club.\n\n11. A book shall be kept in which the qualifications of candidates for election shall be stated by the proposers.\n\n12. The election of new members shall take place annually at the meeting in October.\n\n13. At least seven days before the date of election, the Secretary shall send to each member a printed list of the candidates for election.\n\n14. The election shall be by ballot.\n\n19. The meetings of the Club shall take place six times annually, in October, November, February, March, May and June.\n\n21. The meetings shall take place on Wednesdays and at 8.30pm.\n\n23. At each meeting, one of the members shall, on the motion of the Secretary, be elected to act as Chairman.\n\n24. The Chairman shall direct the business of the meeting.\n\n25. All members shall at the meetings sign their name in an attendance book specially kept for that purpose.\n\n26. Each member may introduce one visitor, whose name shall be sent to the Secretary and announced at the meeting. The member shall be responsible for the observance of the rules by the visitor introduced by him.\n\nThe rules of the club have undergone several changes throughout the years, in wording, substance or numbering. Nonetheless, the nature and objectives of the club have not changed, and remain clearly stated in the latest fully revised version of the rules (November 2010).\n\nThe original rules 1 and 2 are now combined in rule 1: “This Society shall be called the MEDICAL RESEARCH CLUB. The objectives of the Club shall be primarily social, and include demonstration of original work in General and Special Pathological Science, and the discussion of the same, excluding purely clinical observations.”\n\nThe maximum number of Ordinary Members has progressively increased, and different types of membership are accepted, as stated in rule 2: “The Club shall consist of Honorary, Senior, Ordinary and Non-resident Members. There shall not be more than 100 Ordinary Members, all of whom shall be actively engaged in research”.\n\nThe process for the election of new Ordinary Members, as defined in the original Rules 11-14, formally remains similar in the current version of the rules. However, nowadays under rule 13 “Every candidate whose name is submitted for election to the Club shall previously have read a paper before the Club, and have been supported by the signatures of two members of the Club.” In addition, rule 15 (“The election shall be by ballot. […]”), is accompanied by a note stating that “In 2009, it has become accepted practice that 10 members’ signatures lead to election of a candidate to membership once the ordinary memberships fall below the maximum memberships’ number. […]”\n\nThe time limit for scientific communications was a subject of debate during the first years of the Club. Rule 24 states that “No communication to the Club shall occupy more than 15 minutes in delivery […]. The Chairman shall read this rule at the beginning of each meeting and shall enforce it.”\n\nThe main point that “All communications to the Club shall be absolutely private […]” (original rule 4) has been retained in rule 25 of the current list, but a note added in 1934 clarifies that “this rule was never intended to be a secrecy rule. Its prime objective was to enable members to bring forward for discussion unpublished work without incurring the risk of having their results prematurely broadcast. Reading a paper before the Club does not constitute publication. […]”\n\nThe Medical Research Club has held regular meetings since it was founded, with the exception of two periods of interruption coinciding with the two World Wars. The time and location of the meetings have changed over the years, but they have maintained their nature of informal gatherings in which scientific and medical topics are discussed among colleagues and are often accompanied by dinner.\n\nBy 1892, the club was already known outside the United Kingdom, and was invited by the Academy of Sciences of the Institute of France to send two representatives to the celebrations for the seventieth birthday of Pasteur, on 27 December 1892. Two members of the club were also present at the commemoration of the fiftieth year of the founding of the Pasteur Institute in Paris (15 March 1939).\n\nSir Almroth Wright gave his first presentation to the club in 1892, discussing alterations to the blood in haemophilia. Wright has been one of the most prominent members of the club since its foundation, and gave numerous communications over the years. In 1946 the club sent a congratulatory letter to Sir Almroth Wright on occasion of his 85th birthday and of the 50th anniversary of the publication of his method for prophylactic inoculation against typhoid fever.\n\nTwo of the most notable communications to the club were given by Alexander Fleming. In December 1921, Fleming first presented his discovery of lysozyme; then on 13 February 1929 he presented a paper entitled \"A medium for the isolation of Pfeiffer's bacillus\", in which he described his discovery of penicillin, and its ability to inhibit the growth of gram-positive bacteria. Fleming suggested that penicillin could have been used to isolate gram-negative bacteria, such as \"Haemophilus influenzae\", which are resistant to the antibiotic. Minutes from the meeting indicate that this communication did not elicit any discussion.\n\nOn 14 June 1933, the paper \"Propagation in ferrets of a virus obtained from influenza patients\" by Wilson Smith, Christopher Andrewes, and Patrick Laidlaw provided the first demonstration of the presence of a virus in human influenza.\n\nThe first woman to be invited as a visitor and speaker to the club was Harriet Chick in 1909 and 1911. However, the first woman to be elected as an ordinary member was Dorothy Russell, in November 1947.\n\nBetween 1967 and 1969, the club agreed that one meeting each year could be devoted to a specific topic, presented by a distinguished invited speaker in one single lecture lasting 45 minutes. Peter Medawar gave a lecture entitled “Anti-lymphocyte serum” in May 1967; Henry Harris discussed “The expression of genetic information: a study in a hybrid cell” in 1968; and William Hayes presented 'The bacterial chromosome' in 1969. Although members of the club received the lectures with enthusiasm, these mono-thematic meetings did not continue in subsequent years.\n\nAlick Isaacs presented three papers in 1958, 1961 and 1966 describing his work on interferon-alpha, a natural anti-viral molecule that is of major scientific and medical interest.\n\nIn 1970, Yvonne Cossart illustrated the relation between hepatitis and the Australia antigen, now known as the surface antigen of the hepatitis B virus.\n\nSeveral members of the Medical Research Club have received honours and prominent positions for their contributions to science and medicine. Eight members have been awarded the Nobel Prize, and nineteen current members are Fellows of the Royal Society.\n\n\n\nThe Medical Research Club has had regular meetings since resuming its activity after WWII. The meetings are held on Wednesdays, namely the second Wednesday of the month, in February, March, May, October and November. Many of the members who regularly attend the meetings are young, active scientists and clinicians in the early years of their independent research careers; 35 new ordinary members have been elected since 2011. Members are encouraged to bring guests, who are invited to join in the discussions. Guests must abide by the rules of the club, under their host’s responsibility. The location is often, but not always, within the research institution in London where the chairman of the meeting works. The meetings are preceded by a social gathering of approximately 30 minutes during which members can introduce their guests to other members. In the meeting proper, the chairman reads the minutes from the previous meeting, then welcomes the members and announces the names of the guests for the evening. Before introducing the speakers, the chairman reads rule 24 to the audience, to remind the speakers of the 15 minute time limit. Three scientific communications are given by the invited speakers, who then become candidates for membership, and the presentation is opened for discussion. The scientific presentations are followed by a dinner in a restaurant, which provides more opportunities for members and guests to interact.\n\nDuring the meeting, members and guests are asked to confirm their presence by signing the attendance book. A nomination book is also circulated during the meeting with the name of each candidate for membership on each page. Members only (not guests) have the opportunity to support a candidate by signing the relevant page of the nomination book. At the annual general meeting, which is usually held in November, a motion is made for the candidates who have received 10 nominations to be invited to join the club, and the page with their name is removed from the nomination book.\n\nThere are four types of members of the Medical Research Club: Honorary, Senior, Ordinary, and Non-resident. Ordinary Members are elected when, after having presented a paper in front of the club, they receive nominations from 10 current members. The number of Ordinary Members is limited to 100, and all Ordinary Members must be actively involved in bio-medical research and reside or work within a radius of 12 miles from Charing Cross.\n\nAn Ordinary Member who has retired from the club may be elected as an Honorary Member. Election must be supported by at least four-fifths of the members present at the annual general meeting.\n\nOrdinary Members can become Senior Members if their membership has lasted uninterruptedly for twenty years, or when they reach sixty years of age.\n\nAn Ordinary Member who has served at least one year and resides or is engaged in research work outside the 12 mile radius from Charing Cross can become a Non-Resident Member.\n\nAs of January 2016, the London Medical Research Club counts 83 Ordinary, 31 Senior, 45 Non-Resident (32 Ordinary and 13 Senior) and 1 Honorary Member, representing a total of 21 research institutions, including academia, government and industry.\n\nGovernance of the club is via an executive committee, led by ‘The Club Secretary’ (renamed ‘The Chair’ of the Medical Research Club in 2014), the Treasurer and six members of the club (who consider club governance and support the chair and treasurer). Each member of the executive committee is nominated and voted annually the annual general meeting.\n\n"}

{"id": "3141206", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=3141206", "title": "Plunket Society", "text": "Plunket Society\n\nThe Royal New Zealand Plunket Society was an incorporated society in New Zealand until 1 January 2018 when it became the Royal New Zealand Plunket Trust. Plunket provides a range of free health services to children under the age of five with their development, health and wellbeing. The Plunket Society mission is \"to ensure that New Zealand children are among the healthiest in the world\". A lot of Plunket's work is organised by volunteer bases all around New Zealand. There are many different ways to get involved in the Plunket Society.\n\nThe society is most commonly referred to in the community as \"Plunket\".\n\nFrom 1 January 2018 Plunket became the Royal New Zealand Plunket Trust under the Charitable Trusts Act 1957.\n\nWith the motivation to form a 'society' that would 'help mothers and save babies', Dr Frederic Truby King worked on an article focusing on child welfare. A meeting, which led to the founding of the society, was held on 14 May 1907, in Dunedin, by Truby King. King was a medical superintendent and lecturer in mental diseases. He believed that by providing support services to parents, the society could ensure children were fed on a nutritious diet, reducing child mortality rates. He also believed that this would improve adult health as the children got older.\n\nOriginally called the \"Society for the Health of Women and Children\", the society gained royal recognition and the prefix \"Royal\"\nin 1915. Plunket's name derives from an early patron of the Society, Victoria Alexandrina Plunket, mother of eight and wife of then Governor of New Zealand, William Plunket, 5th Baron Plunket.\n\nLater that year, the society first opened The Karitane Home For Babies in Dunedin, and then opened centres in Auckland, Wellington, and Christchurch. These centres were used for both training camps for the nurses and for the babies that were failing to flourish.\n\nThe society laboured for many years under the false perception that it was set up to cater only for European women and their babies; this impression was reinforced by the fact that the Department of Health operated a \"Native Health Nurse Service\" specifically for Maori in rural areas.\n\nIn 1912, King made a lecture tour on the Plunket Society. In these tours he was highly successful in attracting support for the society, partly because he exaggerated the effect on infant mortality rates. As a result of his tour, 60 new centres opened around New Zealand, each employing a nurse. The centres were badged as Plunket Rooms, however they are now referred to as Plunket Clinics. King published several manuals, among them \"Feeding and Care of Baby\" (1913), and \"The Expectant Mother and Baby's First Months\" (1916). This latter publication was given to every applicant for a marriage licence.\n\nMothers were even given practices to inform them of domestic hygiene and mothercraft that were based on King's ideology. They included the regularity of feeding, eating and bowel habits. In New Zealand the Plunket philosophy become 'parenting lore' and within three decades New Zealand had the lowest infant mortality rate in the world.\n\nMany changes have been made to Plunket teaching and organisation over the years. The initial strict parenting regimes have given way to more flexible care and support, and Karitane Hospitals were replaced in the 1970s with Plunket Karitane family centres. 1981 saw the introduction of a car seat rental scheme, and in 1994 a telephone advice service, PlunketLine, was inaugurated. Special training schemes have been initiated for Māori Health Workers to give culturally appropriate guidance where necessary, and Plunket is also seeing an increase in the number of Pacific Island families enrolling.\n\nToday, there are hundreds of centres across New Zealand. The Plunket society is continuing to grow, through the help of technology being able to promote the society. Instead of just having clinics they have centres/services that help with car seats, they also have Facebook chats online so parents/caregivers can ask questions or simply find an answer.\n\n"}

It consists of the retention of water during the period of time immediately preceding the menstrual cycle (that is, the latter half of the luteal phase, or the week before menstruation). This water retention is most noticeable for its temporary enlargement of the breasts, which is often related to breast tenderness. The excess fluid is lost during menstruation. During this event, the water retention can store enough extra fluid to add an extra of weight. The phenomenon is thought to be caused by high levels of circulating progesterone, estrogen, and prolactin, which stimulates secretory cells in the body. In the breasts, increased blood flow is also thought to be involved. Water retention and breast swelling can also be caused by hormonal contraceptives (which contain estrogen and/or a progestogen).\n\nAccording to three studies, fluid retention is not premenstrual, but rather peaks on the first day of menstrual flow. It also does not appear to be correlated to serum levels of progesterone or estradiol. Fluid retention is higher in recreational runners as compared to “normally active” women.\n\n"}
{"id": "34196819", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=34196819", "title": "Primary care ethics", "text": "Primary care ethics\n\nPrimary care ethics is the study of the everyday decisions that primary care clinicians make, such as: how long to spend with a particular patient, how to reconcile their own values and those of their patients, when and where to refer or investigate, how to respect confidentiality when dealing with patients, relatives and third parties. All these decisions involve values as well as facts and are therefore ethical issues. These issues may also involve other workers in primary healthcare, such as receptionists and managers.\n\nPrimary care ethics is not a discipline; it is a notional field of study which is simultaneously an aspect of primary health care and applied ethics. De Zulueta argues that primary care ethics has ‘a definitive place on the ‘bioethics map’, represented by a substantial body of empirical research, literary texts and critical discourse (2, 9, 10). The substantial body of research referred to by De Zulueta (9) has a tendency to be issue-specific, such as to do with rationing(11), confidentiality, medical reports, or relationships with relatives.\n\nMuch of the literature on primary care ethics concerns primary care physicians. The term primary care physician is synonymous with family practitioner, or general practitioner; meaning a medically qualified clinician who is the first point of access to health care, with general responsibilities which may but do not necessarily include child health or obstetrics and gynaecology. Other primary care clinicians; nurses, physiotherapists, midwives, and in some situations pharmacists may face similar issues, and some (confidentially, prioritisation of patients) may also involve administrative staff. In some healthcare systems primary care specialists may also encounter many of these issues.\n\nAlthough the ethical decisions made in primary care are often as less dramatic than those in high-tech medicine (1), their cumulative effect may be profound (2), because of the vast number of health care encounters which take place in primary care, (approximately 400.3 million in England in 2008 alone (3, 4) ). Each of these involves ethical judgements, occasionally difficult, often straightforward; often deliberate but more often unconscious. Also, since primary care is often the first step in the patient journey, small decisions made then may make big differences later on. Most of the bioethical literature however deals with tertiary medicine, and much less attention is paid to the daily concerns of primary care physicians and members of the primary care team (5).\n\nIn countries with well developed primary health care, patients often stay with the same practice for many years, allowing practices to gather a large amount of information and to develop personal relationships over time. Patients often see the same clinician for a variety of problems, at once or at different times. Whole families may see the same doctors and nurses, who may also be their friends and neighbours. These factors affect moral decisions in primary care, and raise ethical dilemmas which might not occur often in secondary and tertiary medical care (6, 7). Moreover, the transfer into the community of services previously provided in hospital (such as specialist chronic disease management and mental health) may lead to the ethical dilemmas arising which were previously only encountered in secondary care (8).\n\nSpicer and Bowman argue that the ‘tertiary’ level ethical problems that dominate so much of the debate about healthcare ethics, such as genetics, cloning, organ donation and research, are experienced entirely differently in primary care. Moreover, what might be argued to be core moral principles, such as autonomy and justice, may be reinterpreted when viewed through the lens of primary care (13). Toon, by contrast argues such re-interpretations are not exclusive to general practice and primary care. Doctors in other specialities (such as psychiatry, rheumatology, HIV medicine, where specialists take primary responsibility for a patient’s health care over a considerable period) may perform what he terms the interpretative function, but when then do so they are acting as generalists and practising generalism (14). The extension of this argument is that it is not just good primary care physicians who are aware of the ethics of the everyday, but good clinicians (15).\n\nAccording to Toon (16), doctors in primary care are charged with three tasks:\n\n1. To deliver the best possible, evidence based medical care to patients who have physical or mental illnesses that can be understood and treated or cured within a biomedical framework\n\n2. Insofar as it lies within their power, to help prevent avoidable illness and death in their patients\n\n3. To help those who are or who believe themselves to be ill to cope with their illnesses, real or feared, to the best of their ability and so to achieve their maximum potential as human beings.\n\nThe first two tasks largely involve understanding the patient as a biopsychosocial system that the doctor is seeking to influence, whilst the third involves seeing the patient as a fellow human being in need. Reconciling these tasks is not easy.\n\nIn many health-care systems patients can only see specialists by referral from doctors in primary care, a system which restricts access to secondary care and is often called “primary care gatekeeping”. Although historically in some countries this developed as a mutually beneficial arrangement between specialists and primary care doctors, rather than from a desire to improve patient care, it is widely recognised that it benefits both individual patients and the health care system. Individual patients benefit from having a personal doctor who can integrate their health care and view their problems together rather than in isolation, and who can protect them from over-investigation and over-treatment -which Toon characterises as the 'furor therapeuticus' of specialist medicine (16). Patients as a whole benefit because the system ensures that expensive secondary care resources are spent on those who have the greatest need.\n\nSome people however are concerned that gatekeeping can damage the doctor-patient relationship, since the doctor cannot act solely in the interests of the individual patient (17). Others have questioned whether this is ever possible, even without gatekeeping. Much depends on the system within which gatekeeping operates, and how great the pressures are on the primary care doctor not to refer, and how strong the incentives, personal, professional and financial are for or against referral. All are agreed that “positive gatekeeping” in which doctors are rewarded for encouraging patients to have unnecessary or dubious procedures, as exists in many private systems, is unethical, and that avoiding unnecessary treatment (therapeutic parsimony) is desirable. Heath has pointed out that the primary care doctor has influence over two other “gates” between illness and health, and between self care and professional care (18).\n\nIt is traditional in many countries that primary care doctors issue certificates to allow patients to be absent from work for reasons of sickness. In some countries such certificates are required even for one day’s absence from work, and this can form a considerable part of the primary care doctor’s workload. In other countries these certificates are only needed for longer periods of illness. In either case this can function can pose ethical problems for doctors as they try to reconcile a duty to do the best for the patient, a duty not to lie to employers, and the need to maintain the doctor patient relationship for professional and/or financial reasons.\n\nMany people want information on patients’ health, and are prepared to pay for it. Insurance companies, employers, social agencies such as the police and the courts and many other bodies have interests in the health status of individuals. The primary care physician is often best placed to provide this information, but doing so can pose ethical problems, particularly in respect of confidentiality. Although patients may sign a consent form to allow information to be released, this consent is not always free, since the patient is often in a position where it would be difficult to refuse, and/or it is not informed, in that patients are often given forms to consent to the release of medical records without what this means being properly explained to them. Doctors can face a conflict of interest in this situation, since they can benefit financially from the fees paid for the release of such information. This poses a difficult ethical conflict as the doctor tries to “serve two masters”; the patient who has a right to confidentiality and the employer or other agency that is paying for the information. Confidentiality has been identified as a key concern to general practitioners in the UK and has been described as one way in which they display their commitment to patient-centeredness (19).\n\nAs the first point of contact with health services, primary care doctors have particular responsibilities with respect to access. Patients typically and understandably want to see the doctor of their choice at the time and place of their choosing, without waiting, and for the length of time they feel they require; however it is rarely possible for all these conditions to be met. The decisions that doctors make about how best to reconcile these conflicting demands by appointment arrangements, arrangements for emergency consultation etc. have a strong ethical as well as practical component.\n\nSo too do decisions doctors make about the allocation of their time and resources between different problems and different patients. The three aspects of general practice are mentioned above but even within these doctors make choices that are ethical. One doctor may give priority to the care of patients with diabetes, another to women’s health, and a third to psychological problems and so on.\n\nIn some countries it is common place for doctors to strike – in others this is seen as unethical. This again depends on the values that doctors espouse, and in this case in particular on doctors' understanding of the nature of the doctor patient relationship.\n\nA characteristic feature of primary care is that doctors’ often care for several patients who are related to each other. They also often care for a number of individuals and families who live and/or work in close proximity, and whose lives are intimately related to each other. Particularly though not exclusively in rural areas, the same applies to the doctor and to his staff. This can be a considerable strength of general practice, since doctors gain a fuller understanding of the social context in which their patients live and become ill. It can also pose ethical problems, however particularly in conflicts between duties to different individuals – family members, employers and employees, and even between friends, when the illness of one affects the life or health of another. Confidentiality can also be a problem, as patients may not understand or accept that information given to the doctor by one family member may not be divulged to others.\n\nRespect for confidentiality, and maintaining confidence amongst patients that confidentiality is respected can be difficult not just for doctors but also for other members of their staff in such situations.\n\nAs in other aspects of applied ethics, different approaches may be used to understand these problems; they may be seen in terms of the rights and duties involved in medical practice, or how to maximise the good through the work clinicians do, or in terms of the virtues needed to flourish as a clinician or a patient. Deciding which moral framework to apply brings primary care ethics into contact with meta-ethics and epistemology. There is increasing interest in the empirical study of primary care ethics, often using qualitative research methods, which raises important metaethical and methodological questions about the relationship between facts and values.\n\n"}

Founded in 1998 by Jenifer Estess, Valerie Estess, Meredith Estess, and Julianne Hoffenberg, Project ALS recruits scientists and doctors to work together — rationally and aggressively — toward a better understanding of ALS and other closely related neuro-degenerative diseases.\n\nProject ALS was founded in 1998 as a non-profit organization when Jenifer Estess, a 35-year-old New York theater and film producer, was diagnosed with ALS. Historically, scientists working separately on various aspects of the disease conducted ALS research. Project ALS changed that approach by requiring that researchers and doctors work together, share data openly, and meet research milestones.\n\nProject ALS's Research Advisory Board (RAB) brings together accomplished scientists to seek out the most promising research and set the agenda for the entire research field.\n\nIn 2008, scientists from the Jenifer Estess Stem Cell Lab, Harvard, and Columbia achieved the \"Time\" \"Scientific Breakthrough of the Year\" by reprogramming motor neurons from a small sample of skin from an ALS patient — a method known as iPS, or induced pluripotent stem cell technology.\n\nA cell's inability to metabolize proteins is a hallmark of ALS, Alzheimer's, Parkinson's and Huntington's diseases. The Project ALS team led by researchers at Harvard and the University of Massachusetts are studying pathways responsible for poor protein management in ALS.\n\nALS affects nearly all voluntary muscles in the body except for the muscles controlling eye movement. Project ALS is driving a six-laboratory study of ocular motor neuron resistance. The goal is to confer resistance upon more vulnerable motor neurons in ALS.\n\nProject ALS researchers at Columbia University have identified distinctive lipid signatures that may lead to early diagnosis and information about disease progression.\n\nThe following people and groups have been involved with Project ALS:\n\n"}

Psychomotor retardation can cause a visible slowing of physical and emotional reactions, including speech and affect. This is most-commonly seen in people with major depression and in the depressed phase of bipolar disorder; it is also associated with the adverse effects of certain drugs, such as benzodiazepines. Particularly in an inpatient setting, psychomotor retardation may require increased nursing care to ensure adequate food and fluid intake and sufficient personal care. Informed consent for treatment is more difficult to achieve in the presence of this condition.\n\n\nExamples of psychomotor retardation include the following:\n\n\nIn schizophrenia, activity level may vary from psychomotor retardation to agitation; the patient will experience periods of listlessness and may be unresponsive, and at the next moment be active and energetic.\n\n"}

The RND superfamily includes seven families: the heavy metal efflux (HME), the hydrophobe/amphiphile efflux-1 (gram-negative bacteria), the nodulation factor exporter family (NFE), the SecDF protein-secretion accessory protein family, the hydrophobe/amphiphile efflux-2 family, the eukaryotic sterol homeostasis family, and the hydrophobe/amphiphile efflux-3 family. These RND systems are involved in maintaining homeostasis of the cell, removal of toxic compounds, and export of virulence determinants. They have a broad substrate spectrum and can lead to the diminished activity of unrelated drug classes if over-expressed. The first reports of drug resistant bacterial infections were reported in the 1940s after the first mass production of antibiotics. Most of the RND superfamily transport systems are made of large polypeptide chains. RND proteins exist primarily in gram-negative bacteria but can also be found in gram-positive bacteria, archaea, and eukaryotes.\n\nThe RND protein dictates the substrate for the completed transport systems including: metal ions, xenobiotics or drugs. Transport of hydrophobic and amphiphilic compounds are carried out by the HAE-RND subfamily. While the efflux of heavy metals are preformed HME-RND.\n\nRND proteins are large and can include more than 1000 amino acid residues. They are generally composed of two homologous subunits (suggesting they arose as a result of an intragenic tandem duplication event that occurred in the primordial system prior to divergence of the family members) each containing a periplasmic loop adjacent to 12 transmembrane helices. Of the twelve helices there is a single transmembrane spanner (TMS) at the N-terminus followed by a large extracytoplasmic domain, then six additional TMSs, a second large extracytoplasmic domain, and five final C-terminal TMSs. TM4 governs the specificity for a particular substrate in a given RND protein. Therefore, TM4 can be an indicator for RND specificity without explicit knowledge of the remainder of the protein.\n\nRND pumps are the cytoplasmic residing portion of a complete tripartite complex (Fig. 1) which spreads across the outer-membrane and the inner membrane of gram-negative bacteria, also commonly referred to as the CBA efflux system. The RND protein associates with an outer membrane channel and a periplasmic adaptor protein, and the association of all three proteins allows the system to export substrates into the external medium, providing a huge advantage for the bacteria.\n\nThe CusA protein, a HME-RND member transporter, was able to be crystallized providing valuable structural information of HME-RND pumps. CusA exists as a homotrimer with each unit consisting of 12 transmembrane helices (TM1-TM12). The periplasmic domain consists of two helices, TM2 and TM8. In addition, the periplasmic domain is made up of six subdomains, PN1, PN2, PC1, PC2, DN, DC, which form a central poor and a dock domain. The central pore is formed by PN1, PN2, PC1, PC2, and together stabilize the trimeric organization of the homotrimer.\n\nThe HME-RND family functions as the central protein pump in metal ion efflux powered by a proton-substrate antiport. The family includes pumps which export monovalent metals—the Cus system, and pumps which export diavlent metals—the Czc system.\n\nHeavy metal resistance by the RND family was first discovered in \"R. metallidurans\" through the CzcA and later the CnrA protein. The best characterized RND proteins include CzcCBA (Cd, Zn, and Co), CnrCBA (Ni and Co), and NccCBA (Ni, Co and Cd) in \"Cupriavidus,\" Czr (Cd and Zn resistance) in \"Pseudomonas aeruginosa,\" and Czn (Cd, Zn, and Ni resistance) in \"Helicobacter pylori.\" It has been proposed that metal-ion efflux occurs from the cytoplasm and periplasm based on the location of multiple substrate binding sites on the RND protein.\n\nThe Czn system maintains homeostasis of Cadmium, Zinc, and Nickel resistance; it is involved in Urease modulation, and gastric colonization by \"H. pylori\". The CznC and CznA proteins play the dominating role in nickel homeostasis.\n\nCzc confers resistance to Cobalt, Zinc, and Cadmium. The CzcCBA operon includes: CzcA (the RND family specific protein), the membrane fusion protein (MFP) CzcB, and the outer membrane factor protein (OMF) CzcC, all of which form the active tripartite complex, and the \"czcoperon\". Expression of the operon is regulated through metal ions.\n\nThe RND family plays an important role in producing intrinsic and elevated multi-drug resistance in gram-negative bacteria. The export of amphiphilic and hydrophobic substrates is governed by the HAE-RND family. In \"E. coli\" five RND pumps have been specifically identified: AcrAB, AcrAD, AcrEF, MdtEF, and MdtAB. Although it is not clear how the tripartite complex works in bacteria two mechanisms have been proposed: \"Adaptor Bridging Model\" and \"Adaptor Wrapping Model\".\n\nHAE-RNDs involvement in the detoxification and exportation of organic substrates allowed for recent characterization of specific pumps due to their increasing medical relevance. Half of the antibiotic resistance demonstrated in \"in vivo\" hospital strains of \"Pseduomonas aeruginosa\" was attributed to RND efflux proteins. \"P. aeruginosa\" contain 13 RND transport systems, including one HME-RND and the remaining HAE-RNDs. Among the best identified are the Mex proteins: MexB, MexD, and MexF, which detoxify organic substances. It is proposed that the MexB systems demonstrates substrate specificity for beta-lactams; while the MexD-system expresses specificity for cepheme compounds.\n\nIn \"E. coli\" multi-drug resistance develops from a variety of mechanisms. Particularly concerning is the ability of efflux mechanisms to confer broad band resistivity. RND efflux pumps provide extrusion for a range of compounds. Five protein transporters in \"E. coli\" cells that belong to the HAE-RND subfamily have been classified, including the multi-drug efflux protein AcrB, the outer membrane protein TolC and the periplasmic adaptor protein AcrA. The TolC and AcrA proteins are also utilized in the tripartite complex in other identified RND efflux proteins. The AcrAB-TolC efflux system is responsible for the efflux of antimicrobial drugs like penicillin G, cloxacillin, nafcillin, macrolides, novobiocin, linezolid, and fusidic acid antibiotics. Other substrates include dyes, detergents, some organic solvents, and steroid hormones. The ways in which the lipophilic domains of the substrate and the RND pumps is not completely defined.\n\nThe crystallized AcrB protein, provides insight into the mechanism of action of HAE-RND proteins, and other RND family proteins.\n\nMdt(A) is an efflux pump that confers resistance to a variety of drugs. It is expressed in \"L. lactis, E. coli\" and various other bacteria. Unlike other RND proteins Mdt(A) contains a putative ATP-binding site and two C-motifs conserved in its fifth TMS. Mdt is effective at providing the bacteria with resistance to tetracycline, chloramphenicol, lincosamides and streptomycin. The source of energy for active efflux by Mdt(A) is currently unknown.\n"}

Her cyst was removed August 1, 2005. Holmes sought treatment in the US claiming that she was unable to get timely treatment in Canada. Holmes sued the Ontario provincial government seeking payment for her medical and travel expenses. She has given testimony before members of the US Congress during a Republican-sponsored hearing about healthcare legislation, and has appeared in ads seeking to repeal the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act and defeat President Obama in the 2012 presidential election.\n\nThe facts surrounding her medical condition are controversial and cannot be independently verified because she has refused to release her medical records, citing her lawsuit. However, the Mayo Clinic, where the surgery was performed, has stated that she could have eventually lost her sight without surgery.\n\nShe is a resident of Waterdown, Ontario, a small community in the rural part of Hamilton.\nIn 2007, she described herself as a family mediator. In 2008, she described herself as a patient advocate.\n\nHolmes initiated a lawsuit against the Ontario government on September 5, 2007.\nThe Canadian Constitution Foundation sponsored the lawsuit, which also included Lindsay McCreith, a Newmarket, Ontario resident, who traveled to the United States for timely treatment of a brain tumor. Her case cited \"Chaoulli v Quebec\", a Supreme Court of Canada ruling on direct billing filed by Quebec physician Jacques Chaoulli. As of September 2009, the lawsuit was still unresolved.\n\nHolmes published a YouTube video of her appearance on Global TV in 2007. \nHolmes and her husband have two YouTube channels (homiemagnum and shonaholmes3) where copies were placed for the Canadian Constitution Foundation. This group is backing the joint statement of claim, along with Lindsay McCreith of Newmarket, against the province of Ontario. In 2009, the Holmes story was publicized in the United States debates on American health care reform. Holmes continued to participate in the US health care debate, publishing op-eds in American papers.\n\nIn 2009 her story was presented in a US television advertisement as a cautionary tale of what Americans could expect if they were to adopt a publicly funded health care system like the Canadian health care system. The advertisement was paid for by \"Patients United Now,\" a project of Americans for Prosperity Foundation, an American conservative political advocacy group.\nThe ad featuring Holmes was broadcast at a cost of $1.8 million in eight US states.\n\n\"We went 100 per cent into socialized medicine and we lost all our options,\" Holmes said recently of the Canadian system.\n\nAfter being told she would have to wait six months for treatment in Canada, she mortgaged her home to pay $100,000 for treatment at the Mayo Clinic. She is quoted as saying the Canadian health care system failed her. In an ad broadcast on American television she said, \"If I'd relied on my government, I'd be dead.\"\n\nWhile Holmes referred to her condition as a \"brain tumor,\" Ian Welsh, writing in the \"Huffington Post\", reports that while the Mayo Clinic characterizes Holmes's treatment as a success, they say she had \"a Rathke's Cleft Cyst on her pituitary gland\". The Canadian Broadcasting Corporation (CBC) interviewed neurosurgeons in Montreal and Toronto who described her claims as exaggerated; they stated that her condition was a benign cyst, not a medical emergency. The Mayo Clinic has been cited as saying that the condition is \"not known to be fatal\" and makes no claim that her life was in danger, but it stated that she could have eventually lost her sight without surgery.\n\nAs a result of publicity generated by the television ad, Holmes has been interviewed many times on American television, including five interviews on the Fox Network, and one interview on CNN.\n\nThe use of her claims in the US stirred great controversy in Canada, where the Canadian health care system is popular across the political spectrum.\nThe use of her claims triggered comments from Ujjal Dosanjh, the Liberal Party of Canada's health critic, who called her case \"an exception to the rule.\"\nJim Meek wrote in the \"Halifax Chronicle Herald\", commenting on the strength of Canadian reaction to the Holmes claims:\nThe late Jack Layton, the leader of the New Democratic Party at the time, travelled to the United States, so he could appear on American television to rebut Holmes's claims.\n\nOn July 23, 2009, a few days following the publication of the ad, the \"Hamilton Spectator\" reported on its front page the troubles faced by another resident of Waterdown, whose home phone was also listed under the name \"S. Holmes\".\nAccording to the \"Spectator\", Palmira Holmes was inundated by callers' wanting to chastise Shona Holmes, describing the volume of calls as \"like being bombarded\". The \"Spectator\" commented that the volume of angry calls Palmira was receiving was consistent with the large volume of comments left on Canadian media websites. \n\nThe \"Toronto Star\" published a letter to the editor from another Waterdown resident, who had a true brain tumor. She described the care she received in the Canadian health care system as being of \"exceptional quality\".\nHer letter concluded with the comment: \"I know our health care system works and if Holmes didn't have a problem with her physician what exactly are her motives for taking part in this media spectacle?\"\n\nThe \"Hamilton Spectator\" interviewed Kenneth Sherman, a leader of a group of American expatriates who live in Canada. According to Sherman, Americans who lived in Canada, and received care under the Canadian health care system, recognized that if her account was accurate, her case was an atypical one. He challenged the accuracy of her account. He said the Americans who were members of his group, Democrats Abroad, received care under the Canadian health care system and were considering sponsoring a counterad to rebut Holmes' claims.\n\nHolmes was featured again in an advertisement targeting the 2012 United States presidential election. In the ad, placed by the political action committee \"Americans For Prosperity\", Holmes refers to the condition treated as a \"rare brain condition.\"\n"}

Compiling a description of her character is a complex task because quite a few facts about her changed when her character was brought from page to screen.\n\nThe fact that Tara had a neglected childhood is one fact that remains the same, but in the books, we read that both of her parents were abusive alcoholics; on \"True Blood\", the only parent we see and hear about is her mother. The television show also expands Tara's family to include the spared Lafayette Reynolds and his mother, Ruby Jean Reynolds.\n\nTara has two siblings, a brother and a sister. They both left Bon Temps and Tara behind as soon as they were able. In \"Living Dead in Dallas\", Tara is engaged to \"Eggs\" Benedict Talley, but this relationship ends when a secret sex party they attend ends badly. She then opens up a clothing store called Tara's Togs, and then briefly dates the vampire Franklin Mott. He soon dumps her and gives her to the vampire Mickey who turns out to be a sadist. The situation with Mickey gets so bad, Sookie and the vampire Eric Northman must take steps to rescue her.\n\nAfter owning and operating her own business for a few years, Tara becomes ready to settle down. During the events of \"All Together Dead\", she and JB du Rone elope. Tara is currently pregnant with JB's twins. She confides this to Sookie, telling her that she did not plan on having a baby, but felt she should try her best and be the great mother that she herself never had. It is Claude who reveals that Tara is having twins, a boy and a girl. She later gives birth to a daughter named Sara Sookie and a son named Robert Thornton with help from Sookie. She and JB go through some financial problems after the birth of the twins and JB decides to work as a stripper at Hooligans, a bar owned by Sookie's fairy cousin Claude, to great annoyance of Tara. After \"Dead Ever After\" Tara and JB divorce. Tara became very successful in her business and even opened up a series of clothing stores.\n\nIn the HBO series \"True Blood\", Tara is portrayed by actress Rutina Wesley. Actress Brook Kerr was originally cast in the role, but she was replaced after the pilot episode., she first appeared in the BloodCopy.com video “Maxine & Tara Thornton interview”.\n\nIn the beginning of the television show, Tara lives with her mother Lettie Mae, who is described as an alcoholic turned fundamentalist who brings nothing but misery to Tara's life. As a child Tara would run to Sookie's house to get away from her mother's beatings. It is because of this and the fact that Tara's acceptance of Sookie as a telepath that the two became best friends. Despite enduring years of abuse, neglect, and disappointment from her mother, Tara still cares deeply about Lettie Mae's well-being, however, Tara is a very angry and wounded individual.\n\nTara leaves her mother's house and moves into Lafayette's home. The discovery of a hidden web cam in his bathroom results in her moving out and into her own apartment. After her mother undergoes an exorcism, Tara briefly moves back in with her, but then Tara is arrested for DUI, so Lettie Mae kicks Tara back out. Tara is later bailed out by the mysterious \"social worker\" Maryann Forrester and she takes up residence at Maryann's luxurious estate.\n\nTara and Sam Merlotte, who is Tara's boss, explore the possibilities of a romantic relationship, but it never establishes. Before they can give it another try, Tara meets \"Eggs\" Benedict Talley, who also lives with Maryann. Sensing that something is not quite right with the mysterious lady, Tara resists the temptation to live with them permanently and moves in with Sookie. However, Sookie goes to Dallas and leaves Tara alone. A vulnerable Tara succumbs to the draw of Maryann and Eggs, but instead of moving in with them, Tara invites the pair to move into Sookie's. Tara and Eggs use this opportunity to get to know each other, and Tara even falls in love with him despite his questionable past. The relationship ends when Eggs is killed by Jason Stackhouse.\n\nTara then crosses paths with the sociopathic vampire Franklin Mott. Franklin glamours and bites her, kidnaps her and holds her bound in a bathroom and takes her to the Mississippi mansion of Russell Edgington. Franklin mixes romantic talk and the prospect of turning her into a vampire with coercive actions, while Tara attempts to soothe him with compliant words, while plotting her own escape. She escapes him on her second attempt, and makes it back to Bon Temps, where she seeks help in a rape survivors' group. Franklin confronts her once more in the parking lot of Merlotte's Bar and Grill a few nights later and attempts to kidnap her again. Tara is saved when Jason Stackhouse arrives and kills Franklin.\n\nJason, the object of Tara's affection since she was a little girl, takes her back to his house to recover. They kiss, but then Jason confesses to being the one who shot Eggs. Tara leaves his place and goes back to Merlotte's where she finds a very angry-at-the-world Sam. The two end up spending another night together, and in the morning Tara feels a little less frayed around the edges. The feeling does not last, however, as Sam decides to reveal his shape-shifting secret to her. She leaves his house and goes back to her mother's house where she finds Lettie Mae in an intimate situation with the Reverend Daniels. It is all too much for Tara, and she leaves Bon Temps for New Orleans, where she changes her first name to \"Toni\" and finds work as a MMA-style cage fighter. Tara has also started a lesbian relationship with another female fighter, Naomi. But Tara eventually returns to Bon Temps and, through her association with the medium Marnie Stonebrook, becomes entangled in the vampires' battle against necromancy. Shortly afterward she is seen pushing Sookie out of the way of a shotgun blast from the gun of Debbie Pelt, but the buckshot hits her in the side and back of the head and neck.\n\nAfter being shot and left for dead, Tara is turned into a vampire by Pamela Swynford De Beaufort at the request of Lafayette and Sookie. She subsequently attacks Lafayette and Sookie upon awaking, holding resentment that the only people she loved would turn her into her worst nightmare. Pam gives her work at Fangtasia first as a bartender, and later as a dancer. As the fifth season progresses Tara becomes more comfortable with her new life, befriends fellow baby vampire Jessica Hamby, and begins to develop romantic feelings for Pam. During Eric Northman and Bill Compton's involvement with the Vampire Authority, Tara assists in the murder of vampire sheriff Elijah Stormer. Pam is arrested by the Authority and held captive, being freed when Tara joins Eric, Jason, Sookie, and Nora Gainesborough in the infiltration of the Authority's headquarters. Upon reuniting, Tara and Pam share a passionate kiss.\n\nTara and Pam are then captured and held in the vampire prison camps, created by Louisiana governor Truman Burrell as part of the state's efforts to control the vampire population. She becomes friends with Willa Burrell, the governor's daughter who was turned by Eric. The group later escapes when Bill breaks into the camp and feeds the vampires his faerie-infused blood, which allows them to (albeit briefly) walk in sunlight.\n\nTara is killed by another vampire in Episode 1 of Season 7.\n\nThroughout season 7 Tara appears to her mother who is under the influence of vampire blood trying to tell her something about their past. In episode 8 it is discovered Tara had an abusive father who left after a fight with Lettie Mae. During the fight a young Tara pulls out her father's gun and almost shoots him but decides to bury it in the yard resulting in his departure. In the end Tara and Lettie Mae make peace one last time. Tara ask her mother to forgive herself and then \"let her go\".

{"id": "4303321", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=4303321", "title": "Ten Cent Beer Night", "text": "Ten Cent Beer Night\n\nTen Cent Beer Night was a promotion held by Major League Baseball's Cleveland Indians during a game against the Texas Rangers at Cleveland Stadium on Tuesday, June 4, 1974.\n\nThe idea behind the promotion was to attract more fans to the game by offering 12 fluid ounce (355 ml) cups of 3.2% beer for just 10 cents each, a substantial discount on the regular price of 65 cents, with a limit of six beers per purchase but with no limit on the number of purchases made during the game. During the game, fans became heavily intoxicated, culminating in a riot in the ninth inning which caused the game to be forfeited due to the crowd's uncontrollable rowdiness and because the game could not be resumed in a timely manner.\n\nThe Indians had previously held such promotions without incident, beginning with Nickel Beer Day in 1971. However, a bench-clearing brawl in the teams' last meeting one week earlier at Arlington Stadium in Texas left some Indians fans harboring a grudge against the Rangers.\n\nIn Texas, the trouble had started in the bottom of the fourth inning with a walk to the Rangers' Tom Grieve, followed by a Lenny Randle single. The next batter hit a double play ball to Indians third baseman John Lowenstein; he stepped on the third base bag to retire Grieve and threw the ball to second base, but Randle disrupted the play with a hard slide into second baseman Jack Brohamer.\n\nThe Indians retaliated in the bottom of the eighth when pitcher Milt Wilcox threw behind Randle's legs. Randle eventually laid down a bunt. When Wilcox attempted to field it and tag Randle out (which he did successfully), Randle hit him with his forearm. Indians first baseman John Ellis responded by punching Randle, and both benches emptied for a brawl. After the brawl was broken up, as Indians players and coaches returned to the dugout, they were struck by food and beer hurled by Rangers fans; catcher Dave Duncan had to be restrained from going into the stands to brawl with fans.\n\nThe game was not suspended or forfeited, no players from either team were ejected, and the Rangers won 3–0.\n\nAfter the game, a Cleveland reporter asked Rangers manager Billy Martin \"Are you going to take your armor to Cleveland?\" to which Martin replied, \"Naw, they won't have enough fans there to worry about.\" During the week leading up to the teams' next meeting in Cleveland, sports radio talk show host Pete Franklin and Indians radio announcer Joe Tait made comments that fueled the fans' animosity toward the Rangers. In addition, \"The Plain Dealer\" printed a cartoon the day of the game showing Chief Wahoo holding a pair of boxing gloves with the caption, \"Be ready for anything.\"\n\nSix days after the brawl in Texas, Cleveland's Ten Cent Beer Night promotion drew 25,134 fans to Cleveland Stadium for the Tuesday night game, twice the number expected.\n\nThe Rangers quickly took a 5–1 lead. Meanwhile, throughout the game, the inebriated crowd grew more and more unruly. Early in the game, Cleveland's Leron Lee hit a line drive into the stomach of Rangers pitcher Ferguson Jenkins, after which Jenkins dropped to the ground. Fans in the upper deck of the stadium cheered, then chanted \"Hit 'em again! Hit 'em again! Harder! Harder!\" A woman ran out to the Indians' on-deck circle and flashed her breasts, and a naked man sprinted to second base as Grieve hit his second home run of the game. One inning later, a father-and-son pair ran onto the outfield and mooned the fans in the bleachers.\n\nAs the game progressed, more fans ran onto the field and caused problems. Ranger Mike Hargrove, who would later manage the Indians and lead them to the World Series twice in 1995 and 1997, was pelted with hot dogs and spit, and at one point was nearly struck by an empty gallon jug of Thunderbird.\n\nThe Rangers later argued a call in which Lee was called safe in a close play at third base, spiking Jenkins with his cleats in the process and forcing him to leave the game. The Rangers' angry response to this call enraged Cleveland fans, who again began throwing objects onto the field. Someone tossed lit firecrackers into the Rangers' bullpen.\n\nIn the bottom of the ninth, the Indians managed to rally, tying the game 5–5, and had Rusty Torres on second base representing the potential winning run. However, with a crowd that had been drinking heavily for nine innings, the situation finally came to a head.\n\nAfter the Indians had managed to tie the game, a 19-year-old fan named Terry Yerkic ran onto the field and attempted to steal Texas outfielder Jeff Burroughs' cap. Confronting the fan, Burroughs tripped. Thinking that Burroughs had been attacked, Texas manager Billy Martin charged onto the field with his players right behind, some wielding bats. A large number of intoxicated fans – some armed with knives, chains, and portions of stadium seats that they had torn apart – surged onto the field, and others hurled bottles from the stands. Hundreds of fans surrounded the outnumbered Rangers.\n\nRealizing that the Rangers' lives might be in danger, Cleveland manager Ken Aspromonte ordered his players to grab bats and help the Rangers, attacking the team's own fans in the process. Rioters began throwing steel folding chairs, and Cleveland relief pitcher Tom Hilgendorf was hit in the head by one of them. Hargrove, after subduing one rioter in a fistfight, had to fight another on his way back to the Texas dugout. The two teams retreated off the field through the dugouts in groups, with players protecting each other.\n\nThe bases were pulled up and stolen and many rioters threw a vast array of objects including cups, rocks, bottles, batteries from radios, hot dogs, popcorn containers, and folding chairs. As a result, umpire crew chief Nestor Chylak, realizing that order would not be restored in a timely fashion, forfeited the game to Texas. He too was a victim of the rioters, as one struck and cut his head with part of a stadium seat and his hand was cut by a thrown rock. He later called the fans \"uncontrollable beasts\" and stated that he'd never seen anything like what had happened, \"except in a zoo\".\n\nAs Joe Tait and Herb Score called the riot live on radio, Score mentioned the security guards' inability to handle the crowd.

{"id": "12037222", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=12037222", "title": "Third-hand smoke", "text": "Third-hand smoke\n\nThird-hand smoke is contamination by tobacco smoke that lingers following the extinguishing of a cigarette, cigar, or other combustible tobacco product.\n\nThe term \"third-hand smoke\" or \"THS\" is a neologism coined by a research team from the Dana–Farber/Harvard Cancer Center. The 'third-hand' component of the term is a reference to the remnants on surfaces after \"second-hand smoke\" has cleared out. The term \"first-hand smoke\" refers to what is inhaled into the smoker's own lungs, while \"second-hand smoke\" is a mixture of exhaled smoke and other substances leaving the smoldering end of the cigarette that enters the atmosphere and can be inhaled by others; third-hand smoke, by that token, is contamination on the surfaces of objects that remains after the second-hand smoke has cleared.\n\nIt is important to acknowledge the biomarkers of third-hand smoke because they indicate the severity and presence of disease. In a recent study involving mice, biomarkers of THS were discovered after four weeks of initial exposure at equivalent levels to those found in homes of smokers. Researchers used a system that mimicked that of the exposure to humans and sought out biomarkers found in serum, liver, and brain tissues in the mice. The mice were then exposed to THS at varying months and at as early as one month, they began to show signs of increased circulating inflammatory cytokines, tumor necrosis factor, granulocyte macrophage colony stimulating factor, and an increase in the stress hormone epinephrine. Damage from THS exposure continued after two, four, and six months. Such damages included oxidative stress and molecular damage. Some of the mice also became hyperglycemic and hyperinsulinimic, which could mean that insulin resistance could be a consequence of long-term exposure. This study implies that increased exposure time to THS can have dramatic effects. Additional studies with human subjects are still needed to fully understand the implications of THS.\n\nAlthough \"second-hand smoke\" dissipates from a room or confined space after a short period of time, nicotine and other components of the smoke tend to coat a space's surfaces including exposed skin, hair and clothing and continue to emit toxins. Third-hand smoke is environmental tobacco smoke that has oxidized with environmental nitrous acid to create carcinogens not seen in cigarette ingredients or tobacco smoke. The chemicals released in third-hand smoke reacts with indoor pollutants to create a toxic hazard to those exposed, especially children. Carcinogenic tobacco-specific nitrosamines (TSNAs) can be formed when the common indoor pollutant, nitrous acid, comes into contact with nicotine. One TSNA, called 4-(methylnitrosamino)-1-(3-pyridinyl)-1-butanone, is a potent lung-specific carcinogen ubiquitous in tobacco smoke and smokers' homes. The carcinogens found in THS are known as tobacco-specific nitrosamines.\n\nA study was done in 2016 to look at how long third-hand smoke stayed in three different fabrics over a timespan of 72 hours and post washing. The three different fiber types included wool, cotton, and polyester. Levels of THS were measured using a self-designed surface acoustic wave gas sensor (SAW) which measures a frequency change when a compound is laid down on the surface of the sensor. The results of this study found that third-hand smoke does tend to stay in wool the most right after smoking and polyester the least. Wool had the slowest desorption while polyester had the fastest. Also, the study concluded that even though doing laundry and washing these fibers with detergent was an effective way to get rid of some of the smoke, there was still about an average of 300 Hz of THS residue left on all the fibers.\n\nA 2010 study published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences found that nicotine residue which coats smokers as well as interior car or room surfaces can react with nitrous acid present in the air to create tobacco-specific nitrosamines, carcinogens found in tobacco products. This was demonstrated by spraying what was termed a \"high but reasonable\" level of nitrous acid (about 4–12 times the levels typically found in homes) onto cellulose substrates used to wipe the interior of a vehicle that had been heavily smoked in over time. Similar results were found when cellulose substrates were kept (without wiping) in the same vehicle for three days when smoking occurred. Ensuring ventilation while a cigarette is smoked does not eliminate the deposition of third-hand smoke in an enclosed space, according to the study's authors. The study found that eleven carcinogenic compounds could be found in third-hand smoke, including the radioactive element polonium-210.\n\nA study in 2004 measured the levels of nicotine in dust in the homes of three different groups of families. Homes where parents smoked with children present in the home had the highest levels of nicotine found in dust in all rooms of the house, including the rooms of infants and children. Homes where parents attempted to limit exposure of cigarette smoke to their children had lower levels of nicotine found in dust. Homes that had not been smoked in did not contain any traces of nicotine.\n\nHumans can be exposed to THS through inhalation, skin contact, or ingestion. There are also many surfaces that can accumulate THS compounds. Common surfaces that humans come into contact with daily include couches, furniture, curtains, and car seats. THS is thought to potentially cause the greatest harm to infants and young children because younger children are more likely to put their hands in their mouths or be cuddled up to a smoker with toxins on their skin and clothes. Infants also crawl on the floor and eat from their hands without washing them first, ingesting the toxins into their still developing systems.\n\nAccording to a study conducted by Northrup, 22% of infants and children are exposed to SHS/THS in their homes each year, comprising a major proportion of the 126 million nonsmokers exposed to harmful tobacco products annually.\n\nThough research is limited, there are many harmful health effects that have been linked to THS exposure. THS has the potential to impair wound healing by altering the body’s natural anti-inflammatory response, remodel respiratory structure due to increased collagen deposits in airways, and cause permanent damage to DNA. Other health effects include asthma, increased cough morbidity, and other respiratory conditions. If pregnant mothers are exposed to THS, it can slow fetal lung development in the third trimester. In children, THS exposure has also been linked to sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS) as a potential cause factor, and has also been linked to cognitive and memory deficits in growing children. Whether or not these largely theoretical relationships are actually causal in humans at realistic exposure levels remains to be seen.\n\nThird-hand smoke is a relatively newly postulated concept, and public awareness of it is lower than that of second-hand smoke. A 2013 study with six focus groups in metro and rural Georgia asked participants whether they had heard of THS, most of the participants had not heard about it and did not know what third-hand smoke was. Research on THS is growing, but does not compare to the 40 years of research on the effects of second-hand smoke. Yet, it is estimated that 5%-60% of second-hand smoke-related harm may actually be attributable to third-hand smoke exposure. THS poses such a risk because its exposure can linger much longer than second-hand smoke. Third-hand smoke-contaminated surfaces like carpet, walls, and car interiors are also especially hard to clean whereas second-hand smoke can be removed with ventilation.\n\nSmoking rates in the United States have fallen considerably from a high of 42.4% in 1965 to around 17.8% in 2016. But the downward trend is slowing and it is estimated that 23% to 42% of adults in America with low education or living in poverty still smoke. This exposes millions of nonsmokers, many of which are children.\n\nAwareness campaigns for THS are steadily growing in number and primarily focus on the health risks for young children. A 2014 study published in \"Pediatrics\" demonstrated that parents are more likely to attempt to quit smoking if they become convinced that third-hand smoke is harmful to children and are more likely to have smoke-free home and car policies if they are aware of the dangers of third-hand smoke. It was recommended for parents to safeguard their children by ensuring they have a smoke-free zone. One such way recommended for smokers to protect family, friends and others is by smoking outside and showering and changing clothes before coming into contact with others. However, research has shown that parents who are heavy smokers (> 10 cigarettes per day) are less likely to believe that third-hand smoke is harmful to children. Third-hand smoke is one of the issues promoting indoor smoking bans, especially supported by performers such as musicians, who are forced to bring third-hand smoke contamination into their homes through contaminated instruments and cases.\n\nSmoking restrictions have been in place in the US as early as 1975 starting in Minnesota and carrying on with various local and state governments legislating smoke-free or clean indoor air laws. By 1999, all 50 US states and the District of Columbia had some public smoking restrictions. Currently, 26 states have implemented comprehensive “smoke-free” laws that ban smoking in worksites, restaurants and bars and other public areas.\nHowever, while many states have laws in place to ensure smoke-free public areas, children especially receive the majority of their exposure while at home, in private spaces.\n\nA exposure assessment study performed by the Lawrence Berkeley National lab found that 80% to 90% of combusted cigarette nicotine adsorbs into surfaces. It has been shown that deposited nicotine may desorb or resuspend from non-cleaned surfaces and adsorb or redeposit elsewhere, including previously cleaned surfaces.\n\nAccording to the Americans for NonSmokers’ Rights organization website, “Parents, landlords, business owners and others need to be aware of the health risks of exposure to thirdhand smoke and recognize that eliminating smoking is the only way to protect against tobacco's smoke contamination.” This concept is referred to as the \"cessation imperative\" in a 2017 paper; the only way to fully protect people from exposure to thirdhand smoke is for smokers to quit smoking because even smoking in places when others are not present can expose people to tobacco smoke contaminants.\n"}

{"id": "17436480", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=17436480", "title": "Webster ruling", "text": "Webster ruling\n\nThe Webster ruling is a test case in association football law involving Andy Webster, a defender formerly with Heart of Midlothian football club in Edinburgh, Scotland. In September 2006 he became the first player to exploit the updated transfer regulations of FIFA, football's governing body, which stipulated that players are able to unilaterally walk away from a contract after a fixed period, regardless of the duration of the contract itself. Although the long-term effects of the decision remain unclear, it has been compared to the landmark Bosman ruling of 1995 in its potential significance.\n\nThe regulations which led to the Webster ruling were enacted in response to the European Commission, who in 1998 opined that FIFA's then current football transfer system served as an obstruction to players' freedom of movement compared to workers in other industries. FIFA, and its European governing body UEFA, campaigned for a special exemption for football, but after the Commission threatened to abolish the system, the new regulations were put in place by September 2001. Because of the complexity and potential legal ramifications for players, it was five years before Webster's test case emerged.\n\nArticle 17 of FIFA's \"Regulations for the Status and Transfer of Players\" is entitled \"Consequences of Terminating a Contract Without Just Cause\", and is the fifth article of Chapter IV, \"Maintenance of Contractual Stability between Professionals and Clubs\". It outlines the provisions which apply if a contract is terminated without just cause, and the requirement for the party in breach to pay compensation. Specifically, it states that any player who signed a contract before the age of 28 can buy himself out of the contract three years after the deal was signed. If he is 28 or older the time limit is shortened to two years. Article 17 was introduced in December 2004, with effect from 1 July 2005.\n\nIn March 2001, Andy Webster joined Hearts from Arbroath F.C. for a reported £75,000, plus a \"sell-on clause\" which entitled Arbroath to 17.5 percent of any future sum received by Hearts for him. He played regularly for the next five years, and also played for the Scotland national football team. In July 2005, Glasgow side Rangers F.C. were credited with an interest in Webster, and the player requested permission to speak to them. This was refused, and Hearts told the player he would be part of their squad that season. However, in 2006 he became involved in a dispute with club owner Vladimir Romanov after refusing to extend his contract, and was subsequently omitted from the squad for the remainder of the 2005–06 season. Webster, who still had a year of his existing contract remaining, then signed for English Premiership club Wigan Athletic in August that year. The transfer was a protracted affair; it took several months before contracts were approved by FIFA, and the governing body took further time to ascertain if Webster's former club were due any compensation. The matter was further complicated by Hearts' initial refusal to release the player from their books as they sought to challenge the decision.\n\nDespite the efforts made to sign him, Wigan did not provide Webster with a regular first team place, and in January 2007 he returned to Scotland after Rangers signed him on loan for the remainder of the 2006–07 season. Despite persistent injuries which prevented him playing, Rangers manager Walter Smith extended his loan contract to 2008, although a permanent move was not organised until June 2008 as litigation over the Hearts–Wigan transfer continued.\n\nHearts had initially placed a valuation of £5 million on Webster. However, because he had served more than three years of his contract he was outside of FIFA's \"protected period\", and any compensation due to Hearts would, per Article 17, be based primarily on the amount of Webster's salary still outstanding—a figure estimated by Webster's advisors at approximately £250,000.\n\nFIFA's transfer arbitration tribunal, the Dispute Resolution Chamber, met on 4 April 2007 and ruled that Hearts were due £625,000, based on Webster's future wages, his earning potential, and the legal costs. They also found Webster guilty of breaking his contract \"without just cause\", although only on a technicality; he and his agent were late informing the club of his intention to leave, because of confusion over the final match of the season (Hearts had reached the 2006 Scottish Cup Final, but the time limit was calculated from the club's last league game, four days prior to the Cup match). For this he was suspended for the first two weeks of the 2007–08 season.\n\nHearts were quick to lodge an appeal against the ruling, disputing the figure which they said had not been unambiguously calculated. Webster had also indicated a desire to appeal, believing the fine against him was excessive. On 30 January 2008 the Court of Arbitration for Sport, the highest arbitration authority in sport, met in Lausanne and clarified the original ruling. They also reduced the compensation due payable by Webster to £150,000.\n\nThe general assessment from commentators is that the ruling is the most significant since Jean-Marc Bosman successfully challenged the restrictions on freedom of movement for workers for footballers in 1995. There is also speculation that the days of record-breaking transfer fees may be at an end. High-profile players like Frank Lampard, Cristiano Ronaldo, Michael Owen, Steven Gerrard and Wayne Rooney have all been cited as examples of players who could either leave their club for a relatively small amount, or increase their contract bargaining power as a result. Several other players have taken advantage of Article 17, including Tony Sylva and Jonás Gutiérrez.\n\nFIFA were highly critical of the ruling; president Sepp Blatter said \"the verdict in favour of the player will have far-reaching and damaging effects on the game as a whole. [It] is... a Pyrrhic victory for those players and their agents who toy with the idea of rescinding contracts before they have been fulfilled.\" Football clubs were also hostile; A Hearts spokesman described it as a \"dark day for football clubs\", while Celtic, one of Hearts' and Rangers' rivals, stated bluntly that they would sue any player who broke his contract, believing that a court of law would support them regardless of any prior arbitration decision. The European Club Association has vocally criticised the ruling on several occasions, most notably after CAS decided Real Zaragoza had to compensate FC Shakhtar Donetsk for Brazilian midfielder Matuzalém's controversial transfer in May 2009.\n\nConversely, players' organisations were highly supportive of CAS's decision. Tony Higgins, a Scottish representative of international footballers' union FIFPro, said \"Article 17 gives footballers the sort of employee rights that anyone else would expect in the workplace\", while Fraser Wishart, the general secretary of the Scottish players' union who had supported Webster's case, described it as \"a new groundbreaking decision enabling players to enjoy greater freedom of employment.\"\n\n"}
{"id": "12739994", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=12739994", "title": "Whole-body counting", "text": "Whole-body counting\n\nIn health physics, whole-body counting refers to the measurement of radioactivity \"within\" the human body. The technique is primarily applicable to radioactive material that emits gamma rays. Alpha particle decays can also be detected indirectly by their coincident gamma radiation. In certain circumstances, beta emitters can be measured, but with degraded sensitivity. The instrument used is normally referred to as a whole body counter.\n\nThis must not be confused with a \"whole body monitor\" which used for personnel exit monitoring, which is the term used in radiation protection for checking for external contamination of a whole body of a person leaving a radioactive contamination controlled area. \n\nIf a gamma ray is emitted from a radioactive element within the human body due to radioactive decay, and its energy is sufficient to escape then it can be detected. This would be by means of either a scintillation detector or a semiconductor detector placed in close proximity to the body. Radioactive decay may give rise to gamma radiation which cannot escape the body due to being absorbed or other interaction whereby it can lose energy; so account must be taken of this in any measurement analysis. \n\nThere are many ways a person can be positioned for this measurement: sitting, lying, standing. The detectors can be single or multiple and can either be stationary or moving. The advantages of whole-body counting are that it measures body contents directly, does not rely on indirect bio-assay methods (such as urinalysis) as it can measure insoluble radionuclides in the lungs.\n\nOn the other hand, disadvantages of whole-body counting are that except in special circumstances it can only be used for gamma emitters due to self-shielding of the human body, and it can misinterpret external contamination as an internal contamination. To prevent this latter case scrupulous de-contamination of the individual must be performed first.\nWhole body counting may be unable to distinguish between radioisotopes that have similar gamma energies. Alpha and beta radiation is largely shielded by the body and will not be detected externally, but the coincident gamma from alpha decay may be detected, as well as radiation from the parent or daughter nuclides.\n\nAny radiation detector is a relative instrument, that is to say the measurement value can only be converted to an amount of material present by comparing the response signal (usually counts per minute, or per second) to the signal obtained from a standard whose quantity (activity) is well known.\n\nA whole-body counter is calibrated with a device known as a \"phantom\" containing a known distribution and known activity of radioactive material. The accepted industry standard is the Bottle Manikin Absorber phantom (BOMAB). The BOMAB phantom consists of 10 high-density polyethylene containers and is used to calibrate \"in vivo\" counting systems that are designed to measure the radionuclides that emit high energy photons (200 keV < E < 3 MeV).\n\nBecause many different types of phantoms had been used to calibrate \"in vivo\" counting systems, the importance of establishing standard specifications for phantoms was emphasized at the 1990 international meeting of \"in vivo\" counting professionals held at the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) (Kramer and Inn 1991). The consensus of the meeting attendees was that standard specifications were needed for the BOMAB phantom. The standard specifications for the BOMAB phantom provide the basis for a consistent phantom design for calibrating \"in vivo\" measurement systems. Such systems are designed to measure radionuclides that emit high-energy photons and that are assumed to be homogeneously distributed in the body.\n\nA well designed counting system can detect levels of most gamma emitters (>200 keV) at levels far below that which would cause adverse health effects in people. A typical detection limit for radioactive caesium (Cs-137) is about 40 Bq. The Annual Limit on Intake (i.e., the amount that would give a person a dose equal to the worker limit that is 20 mSv) is about 2,000,000 Bq. The amount of naturally occurring radioactive potassium present in all humans is also easily detectable. Risk of death by potassium deficiency approaches 100% as whole-body count approaches zero.\n\nThe reason that these instruments are so sensitive is that they are often housed in low background counting chambers. Typically this is a small room with very thick walls made of low-background steel (~20 cm) and sometimes lined with a thin layer of lead (~1 cm). This shielding can reduce background radiation inside the chamber by several orders of magnitude.\n\nDepending on the counting geometry of the system, count times can be from 1 minute to about 30 minutes. The sensitivity of a counter does depend on counting time so the longer the count, for the same system, the better the detection limit. The detection limit, often referred to as the Minimum Detectable Activity (MDA), is given by the formula:\n...where N is the number of counts of background in the region of interest; E is the counting efficiency; and T is the counting time.\n\nThis quantity is approximately twice the Decision Limit, another statistical quantity, that can be used to decide if there is any activity present. (i.e., a trigger point for more analysis).\n\n\nhttps://www.colorado.gov/pacific/cdphe/radiochemistry-laboratory\n"}
