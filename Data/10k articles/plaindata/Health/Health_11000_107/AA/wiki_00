It occurred in the Yap Islands, an island chain in the Federated States of Micronesia. Zika virus (ZIKV) is a vector-borne flavivirus in the same family as yellow fever, dengue, West Nile and Japanese encephalitis viruses.\n\nIn 2007, physicians in the Yap Islands reported to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention an outbreak of an illness characterized by rash, conjunctivitis, and arthralgia. Initial serum testing revealed some patients had the IgM antibody against dengue virus, yet the patients' signs and symptoms were clinically distinct from dengue fever. Subsequent retesting using consensus primers detected the presence of Zika virus RNA.\n\nA household survey was conducted to determine the proportion of Yap residents with the IgM antibody against Zika virus and to identify possible mosquito vectors of Zika virus. In total, the Yap Islands outbreak had 49 confirmed and 59 probable cases of Zika virus disease. The patients resided in 9 of the 10 municipalities on Yap. None of the patients required hospitalization. No hemorrhagic manifestations occurred and no deaths resulted. It was estimated that 73% (95% confidence interval, 68 to 77) of Yap residents 3 years of age or older had been recently infected with Zika virus. \"Aedes hensilli\" was the predominant mosquito species identified.\n\nThe outbreak of Zika fever in Micronesia demonstrated the transmission of Zika virus outside Africa and Asia. This was considered a significant finding in that previously only 14 cases of Zika virus had been documented since the virus was first identified in 1947. Prior to the Yap Islands outbreak, no previous outbreaks of Zika virus had ever been reported and only 14 cases had been documented since the virus was first isolated in 1947. All previous cases had occurred within Africa and Asia.\n\n\"Aedes aegypti\" has been recognized as the vector of Zika virus. The virus was first isolated in 1947 from a sentinel rhesus monkey stationed on a tree platform in the Zika forest, Uganda.\n\nTransmission is typically via the bite of the \"Aedes aegypti\" mosquito, although in this outbreak, \"Aedes hensilli\" was the predominant mosquito species identified.\n\n\n"}

Its main aim is the introduction of free, safe and legal abortion care in Ireland and Northern Ireland. A significant aim prior to May 2018 was the repeal of the Eighth Amendment of the Irish Constitution, which was achieved by the successful passing of the Thirty-Sixth Amendment 2018. ARC also campaigns for the Northern Ireland Assembly to introduce extensive abortion legislation in common with the rest of the United Kingdom and \"to ensure the health of women in pregnancy is protected in line with international human rights standards\". ARC supports the full decriminalisation of abortion in Ireland.\n\nThe Abortion Rights Campaign was formed on 10 July 2012, when 40 people came together. Initially formed as the Irish Choice Network, after another meeting in the Gresham Hotel in Dublin on 8 December 2012 and another meeting in 19 January 2013 the Abortion Rights Campaign was formally launched. It has organised the annual March for Choice in Dublin since 2013.\n\nMany Irish politicians have supported ARC's aims, such as Richard Boyd Barrett (Anti-Austerity Alliance–People Before Profit), Catherine Murphy (Social Democrats), Mick Wallace, Joan Collins and Clare Daly (Independents 4 Change).. However ARC itself is not affiliated with any political party.\n\nARC was one of the main partner organisations in Together for Yes, the civil society group advocating a Yes vote in the 2018 referendum. One of ARC's founding members was a co-director of Together for Yes. ARC's network of regional groups across the island of Ireland formed the basis for many Together for Yes groups in several counties in Ireland. \n\nIn January 2016, they received a grant of €23,000 from Open Society Foundation for \"educational and stigma-busting projects.\" SIPO reasoned that the money had been raised for a political purpose. The ARC returned the money in November 2016, while disagreeing with the finding. The story was first published in \"The Irish Catholic\" in late March 2017.\n\nARC is an all-volunteer, non-hierarchical organisation. Membership elect a Convening Group annually, which convenes a Steering Group made up of representatives of several working groups and regional groups. Ongoing decision-making is carried out by the Steering Group during regular meetings. There is no one leader or spokesperson of ARC as the Convening and Working Group roles change on a regular basis. This structure is designed to encourage engagement and activity by all members, and to avoid power hierarchies.\n\nThe Abortion Rights Campaign's most visible event is the annual March for Choice, normally held on the Global Day of Action for Safe and Legal Access to Abortion. The March is organised by ARC and attended by the public, as well as various national pro-choice groups, including trade unions such as Unite, Mandate, Teachers Union of Ireland, National Union of Journalists and Union of Students in Ireland, political parties including Labour, Solidarity–People Before Profit, and the Social Democrats, and international groups such as Catholics for Choice.\n\nThe most recent March for Choice was held on 29 September 2018, the first since the vote to repeal the Eighth Amendment. The theme was 'Free Safe Legal', the slogan of ARC, and was chosen to \"show [their] support for stigma-free abortion access for anyone who wants or needs one, regardless of their financial or legal status\".\n\nSpeakers included ARC co-conveners Sarah Monaghan and Denise O'Toole, Zanele Sibindi of Movement of Asylum Seekers in Ireland, Evie Nevin of Disabled Women for Yes and Emma Campbell and Kellie O'Dowd from the Belfast-based Alliance for Choice.\n\nThe 2017 March for Choice was held on 30 September and over 40,000 people took part. The rally at the march's conclusion was addressed by Bernadette Devlin McAliskey. Additional \"sympathy marches\" were held in 20 cities around the world, including London, Sydney and Nicosia.\n"}

It is commonly used by the visually impaired, allowing them to retain their mobility without relying on visual cues from their environment.\n\nAcoustic wayfinding involves using a variety of auditory cues to create a mental map of the surrounding environment. This can include a number of techniques: navigating by sounds from the natural environment, such as pedestrian crossing signals; echolocation, or creating sound waves (by tapping a cane or making clicking noises) to determine the location and size of surrounding objects; and memorizing the unique sounds in a given space to recognize it again later. For the visually impaired, these auditory cues become the primary substitute for visual information about the direction and distance of people and objects in their environment.\n\nHowever, there are a number of common obstacles to acoustic wayfinding techniques: noisy outdoor environments can challenge an individual's ability to identify useful sounds, while indoors, the architecture may not provide an acoustic response which is useful for orientation and destination. Among the most difficult environments to navigate for individuals who rely on acoustic wayfinding are crowded places like department stores, transit stations, and hotel lobbies, or open spaces like parking lots and parks, where distinct sound cues are lacking. This means that, in practice, individuals who navigate primarily by acoustic wayfinding must also rely on a number of other senses – including touch, smell, and residual sight – to supplement auditory cues. These different methods can be used in tandem. For example, visually impaired individuals often use a white cane, not only to physically locate obstacles in front of them, but also to acoustically get a sense of what those obstacles may be. By tapping the cane, they also create sound waves that help them to gauge the location and size of nearby objects.\n\nRecently, architects and acousticians have begun to address the problems faced by people who rely primarily on acoustic wayfinding to navigate urban spaces. The primary work on the architectural implications of acoustic wayfinding comes from a collaboration between Christopher Downey, an architect who went blind in 2008 and has since worked to improve architectural design for the visually impaired, and Joshua Cushner, who leads the Acoustic consulting practice for engineering design firm Arup in San Francisco. Their work focuses on how to plan new facilities to include sensible systems of sound markers and architectural spaces which provide orientation through acoustic cues. On 20 September 2011, the San Francisco chapter of the American Institute of Architects organized an acoustic wayfinding discussion and walking tour, led by Chris Downey and Joshua Cushner. The purpose of the tour was to highlight the ways that visual impaired people associate sounds with particular buildings and locations, creating \"sound markers\" that help them find their way on the street or indoors, and to discuss implementing more unique sound markers into urban design projects.\n\n"}

It espouses the folk-wisdom that apple consumption (or consumption of fruits and vegetables in general) has identifiable health benefits.\n\nFirst recorded in the 1860s, the proverb originated in Wales, and was particularly prevalent in Pembrokeshire. The original wording of the saying was \"Eat an apple on going to bed, and you’ll keep the doctor from earning his bread.\" The current phrasing, \"An apple a day keeps the doctor away\", began usage at the end of the 19th century, early print examples found as early as 1899.\n\nThe background for the proverb was that at bedtime it was served either a fried apple filled with caraway seeds or a fresh apple with caraway seeds stuck in the apple.\nCaraway was considered very healthy and the apple was a way to eat as much caraway as possible.\n\nA 2011 study found that consumption of apples and pears might prevent strokes. A 2012 study found that apple consumption significantly lowered bad cholesterol levels in middle-aged adults. In 2013, the \"BMJ\" published a study as part of its humorous Christmas issue comparing the effects of prescribing everyone in the UK over age 50 either an apple or a statin a day. The study concluded that both interventions would be similarly effective. \n\nA 2015 study looked directly at the relationship between apple consumption and physician visits and found no evidence that the proverb was true. The study did, however, find that people who ate an apple a day did use fewer prescription medications.\n\nHowever, a 2011 study found that adding one ‘Golden Delicious’ apple to the daily diet of a small group of overweight men led to higher levels of LDL cholesterol and triglycerides. The results were attributed to the higher sugar and low-phenolic content of ‘Golden Delicious’ apples.\n"}

{"id": "4699", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=4699", "title": "Blissymbols", "text": "Blissymbols\n\nBlissymbols or Blissymbolics was conceived as an ideographic writing system called Semantography consisting of several hundred basic symbols, each representing a concept, which can be composed together to generate new symbols that represent new concepts. Blissymbols differ from most of the world's major writing systems in that the characters do not correspond at all to the sounds of any spoken language.\n\nBlissymbols was invented by Charles K. Bliss (1897–1985), born Karl Kasiel Blitz in the Austro-Hungarian city of Czernowitz (at present the Ukrainian city of Chernivtsi), which had a mixture of different nationalities that “hated each other, mainly because they spoke and thought in different languages.” \nBliss graduated as a chemical engineer at the Vienna University of Technology, and joined an electronics company as a research chemist.\n\nAs the German Army invaded Austria in 1938, Bliss, a Jew, was sent to the concentration camps of Dachau and Buchenwald. His German wife Claire managed to get him released, and they finally became exiles in Shanghai, where Bliss had a cousin.\n\nBliss devised Blissymbols while a refugee at the Shanghai Ghetto and Sydney, from 1942 to 1949. He wanted to create an easy-to-learn international auxiliary language to allow communication between different linguistic communities. He was inspired by Chinese characters, with which he became familiar at Shanghai.\n\nBliss's system was explained in his work \"Semantography\" (1949, 2nd ed. 1965, 3rd ed. 1978.)\nIt had several names:\nAs the “tourist explosion” took place in the 1960s, a number of researchers were looking for new standard symbols to be used at roads, stations, airports, etc. Bliss then adopted the name \"Blissymbolics\" in order that no researcher could plagiarize his system of symbols.\n\nSince the 1960s/1970s, Blissymbols have become popular as a method to teach disabled people to communicate.\nIn 1971 Shirley McNaughton started a pioneer program at the Ontario Crippled Children's Centre (OCCC), aimed at children with cerebral palsy, from the approach of augmentative and alternative communication (AAC). According to Arika Okrent, Bliss used to complain about the way the teachers at the OCCC were using the symbols, in relation with the proportions of the symbols and other questions: for example, they used “fancy” terms like “nouns” and “verbs”, to describe what Bliss called “things” and “actions”. (2009, p. 173-4).\nThe ultimate objective of the OCCC program was to use Blissymbols as a practical way to teach the children to express themselves in their mother tongue, since the Blissymbols provided visual keys to understand the meaning of the English words, especially the abstract words.\n\nIn his work \"Semantography\" Bliss had not provided a systematic set of definitions for his symbols (there was a provisional vocabulary index instead (1965, pp. 827–67)), so McNaughton's team might often interpret a certain symbol in a way that Bliss would later criticize as a “misinterpretation”. For example, they might interpret a tomato as a vegetable —according to the English definition of tomato— even though the ideal Blissymbol of vegetable was restricted by Bliss to just vegetables growing underground. Eventually the OCCC staff modified and adapted Bliss's system in order to make it serve as a bridge to English. (2009, p. 189) Bliss complaints about his symbols “being abused” by the OCCC became so intense that the director of the OCCC told Bliss, on his 1974 visit, never to come back. In spite of this, in 1975 Bliss granted an exclusive world license, for use with disabled children, to the new Blissymbolics Communication Foundation directed by Shirley McNaughton (later called Blissymbolics Communication International, BCI). Nevertheless, in 1977 Bliss claimed that this agreement was violated so that he was deprived of effective control of his symbol system.\n\nAccording to Okrent (2009, p. 190), there was a final period of conflict, as Bliss would make continuous criticisms to McNaughton often followed by apologies. Bliss finally brought his lawyers back to the OCCC, and both parts reached a settlement:\n\nBlissymbolic Communication International now claims an exclusive license from Bliss, for the use and publication of Blissymbols for persons with communication, language, and learning difficulties.\n\nThe Blissymbol method has been used in Canada, Sweden, and a few other countries. Practitioners of Blissymbolics (that is, speech and language therapists and users) maintain that some users who have learned to communicate with Blissymbolics find it easier to learn to read and write traditional orthography in the local spoken language than do users who did not know Blissymbolics.\n\nUnlike similar constructed languages like aUI, Blissymbolics was conceived as a purely visual, speech-less language, on the premise that “interlinguistic communication is mainly carried on by reading and writing”. Nevertheless, Bliss suggested that a set of international words could be adopted, so that “a kind of spoken language could be established – as a travelling aid only”. (1965, p. 89–90).\n\nSo, whether Blissymbolics constitutes an unspoken language is a controversial question, whatever its practical utility may be. Some linguists, such as John DeFrancis and J. Marshall Unger have argued that genuine ideographic writing systems with the same capacities as natural languages do not exist. It is not certain, however, that they have examined Blissymbols.\n\nBliss's concern about semantics finds an early referent in John Locke, whose \"Essay Concerning Human Understanding\" prevented people from those \"vague and insignificant forms of speech\" that may give the impression of being deep learning.\n\nAnother vital referent is Leibniz’s project of an ideographic language called \"universal character\", based on the principles of Chinese characters. It would contain small figures representing \"visible things by their lines, and the invisible, by the visible which accompany them\", as well as adding \"certain additional marks, suitable to make understood the flexions and the particles.\" (1965, p. 569). Bliss stated that his own work was an attempt to take up the thread of Leibniz's project.\n\nFinally there is a strong influence by the work \"The Meaning of Meaning\" by C. K. Ogden and I. A. Richards, which was considered a standard work on semantics. Bliss found especially useful their \"triangle of reference\": the physical thing or \"referent\" that we perceive would be represented at the right angle; the meaning that we know by experience (our implicit definition of the thing), at the top angle; and the physical word that we speak or write, at the left angle. The reversed process would happen when we read or listen to words: from the words, we recall meanings, related to referents which may be real things or unreal \"fictions\". Bliss was particularly concerned with political propaganda, whose discourses would tend to contain words that correspond to unreal or ambiguous referents.\nThe grammar of Blissymbols is based on a certain interpretation of nature, dividing it into matter (material things), energy (actions), and human values (mental evaluations). In an ordinary language, these would give place respectively to substantives, verbs, and adjectives. In Blissymbols, they are marked respectively by a small square symbol, a small cone symbol, and a small V or inverted cone. These symbols may be placed above any other symbol, turning it respectively into a “thing”, an “action”, and an “evaluation”:\n\nWhen a symbol is not marked by any of the three grammar symbols (square, cone, inverted cone), they may be a non material thing, a grammatical particle, etc.\n\nThe symbol above represents the expression \"world language\", which was a first tentative name for Blissymbols.\nIt combines the symbol for \"writing tool\" or \"pen\" (a line inclined, as a pen being used) with the symbol for \"world\", which in its turn combines \"ground\" or \"earth\" (a horizontal line below) and its counterpart derivate \"sky\" (a horizontal line above). Thus the world would be seen as \"what is among the ground and the sky\", and \"Blissymbols\" would be seen as \"the writing tool to express the world\". This is clearly distinct from the symbol of \"language\", which is a combination of \"mouth\" and \"ear\". Thus natural languages are mainly oral, while Blissymbols is just a writing system dealing with semantics, not phonetics.\n\nThe 900 individual symbols of the system are called \"Bliss-characters\"; these may be \"ideographic\" – representing abstract concepts, \"pictographic\" – a direct representation of objects, or \"composite\" – in which two or more existing Bliss-characters have been superimposed to represent a new meaning. Size, orientation and relation to the \"skyline\" and \"earthline\" affects the meaning of each symbol. A single concept is called a \"Bliss-word\", which can consist of one or more Bliss-characters. In the case of multiple character Bliss-words, the main character is called the \"classifier\" which \"indicates the semantic or grammatical category to which the Bliss-word belongs\". To this can be added Bliss-characters as prefixes or suffixes called \"modifiers\" which amend the meaning of the first symbol. A further symbol, called an \"indicator\" can be added adjacent to the Bliss-word; these are used as \"grammatical and/or semantic markers.\"\nThis sentence means \"I want to go to the cinema.\" This example shows several features of Blissymbolics:\n\nAs elucidated above, Blissymbolics was used in 1971 to help children at the Ontario Crippled Children's Centre (OCCC, now the Bloorview Kids Rehab) in Toronto, Ontario, Canada. Since it was important that the children see consistent pictures, OCCC had a draftsman named Jim Grice draw the symbols. Both Charles K. Bliss and Margrit Beesley at the OCCC worked with Grice to ensure consistency. In 1975, a new organization named Blissymbolics Communication Foundation directed by Shirley McNaughton led this effort. Over the years, this organization changed its name to Blissymbolics Communication Institute, Easter Seal Communication Institute, and ultimately to Blissymbolics Communication International (BCI).\n\nBCI is an international group of people who act as an authority regarding the standardization of the Blissymbolics language. It has taken responsibility for any extensions of the Blissymbolics language as well as any maintenance needed for the language. BCI has coordinated usage of the language since 1971 for augmentative and alternative communication. BCI received a licence and copyright through legal agreements with Charles K. Bliss in 1975 and 1982. Limiting the count of Bliss-characters (there are currently about 900) is very useful in order to help the user community. It also helps when implementing Blissymbolics using technology such as computers.\n\nIn 1991, BCI published a reference guide containing 2300 vocabulary items and detailed rules for the graphic design of additional characters, so they settled a first set of approved \"Bliss-words\" for general use.\nThe Standards Council of Canada then sponsored, on January 21, 1993, the registration of an encoded character set for use in ISO/IEC 2022, in the ISO-IR international registry of coded character sets.\nAfter many years of requests, the Blissymbolic language was finally approved as an encoded language, with code zbl, into the ISO 639-2 and ISO 639-3 standards.\n\nA proposal was posted by Michael Everson for the Blissymbolics script to be included in the Universal Character Set (UCS) and encoded for use with the ISO/IEC 10646 and Unicode standards. BCI would cooperate with the Unicode Technical Committee (UTC) and the ISO Working Group.\nThe proposed encoding does not use the lexical encoding model used in the existing ISO-IR/169 registered character set, but instead applies the Unicode and ISO character-glyph model to the \"Bliss-character\" model already adopted by BCI, since this would significantly reduce the number of needed characters. Bliss-characters can now be used in a creative way to create many new arbitrary concepts, by surrounding the invented words with special Bliss indicators (similar to punctuation), something which was not possible in the ISO-IR/169 encoding.\n\nHowever, at the end of 2009, the Blissymbolic script is still not encoded in the UCS. Some questions are still unanswered, such as the inclusion in the BCI repertoire of some characters (currently about 24) that are already encoded in the UCS (like digits, punctuation signs, spaces and some markers), but whose unification may cause problems due to the very strict graphical layouts required by the published Bliss reference guides. In addition, the character metrics use a specific layout where the usual baseline is not used, and the ideographic em-square is not relevant for Bliss character designs, that use additional \"earth line\" and \"sky line\" to define the composition square. \nSome fonts supporting the BCI repertoire are available and usable with texts encoded with private-use assignments (PUA) within the UCS. But only the private BCI encoding based on ISO-IR/169 registration is available for text interchange.\n\n\n"}

The society had 9 founding members including William Mackenzie, Maurice Nicoll and David Eder. Almost immediately, the society was caught up in the international controversy between Carl Jung and Sigmund Freud. Many of the society's membership were followers of Jung's theories, although Jones himself enjoyed a close relationship with Freud and wished for the society to be unambiguously Freudian.\n\nThe outbreak of World War One in 1914 meant that the nascent society, which depended on correspondence with psychoanalysts in Vienna, then part of Austria-Hungary, had to be suspended. There were a few informal meetings during the war, but these became less and less frequent as the war went on.\n\nIn 1919, Ernest Jones refounded the society as the British Psychoanalytical society. He took the opportunity to define the society as freudian in nature, removing most of the jungian members. With the help of John Rickman , the society established a clinic and a training arm, known as the Institute of Psychoanalysis. \n\nIn the 1920's, Ernest Jones and the society grew increasingly under the influence of Melanie Klein. Jones was inspired by her writings to develop several psychoanalytical concepts. In 1925, Klein delivered a series of talks at the society, and Jones invited her to move to London, which she did shortly after. Klein's work was well received in London, but it attracted increasing controversy on the continent, where most psychoanalysts were based.\n\nThe rise of the Nazi Party in Germany and later in Austria, led to increasing numbers of German and Austrian Psychoanalysts fleeing to London, where they joined the burgeoning society. By 1937, 13 out of 71 members were refugees from Europe. Ernest Jones personally intervened to bring Sigmund Freud and his daughter, Anna Freud, to London. In 1938, Sigmund Freud wrote to Jones:\"The events of recent years have made London the principal site and center of the psychoanalytical movement. May the society carry out the functions thus falling to it in the most brilliant manner.\" By the start of the second world war, 34 out of 90 members were emigres from the continent. Among them were:\nHowever, the assimilation of so many prominent Psychoanalysts from continental Europe created tensions. The huge difference in the approaches of Anna Freud and Melanie Klein led to the development of several factions. Increasingly, presentations of papers at the society became thinly veiled attacks on opposing factions theories. For example, in March 1937 Melitta Schmideberg (Klein's daughter) presented her paper: \"After the Analysis – Some Phantasies of Patients\", which viciously attacked almost all of Klein's ideas, though it did not mention her by name. \n\n\"See main article: Controversial discussions\"\n\nBy 1942, relations between the factions within the society had become so heated that a committee had to be convened to facilitate monthly discussions on the scientific nature of the society. The committee was chaired by three members of the society, each representing one of the major factions:\n\n\nAfter heated debate, the committee resolved to a \"gentleman's agreement\" - which ensured that each faction would have equal representation within all committees within the society. It was also agreed that training of future Psychoanalysts at the institute would be organised into two pathways: one Kleinian, and one Freudian.\n\nWith the resolution of the controversial discussions, the society became dominated by new psychoanalysts such as Donald Winnicott and Wilfred Bion.\n\n\n= The society today =\nThrough its related bodies, the Institute of Psychoanalysis and the London Clinic of Psychoanalysis, it is involved in the teaching, development, and practice of psychoanalysis at its headquarters at Byron House, west London.

{"id": "3417428", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=3417428", "title": "Critical illness insurance", "text": "Critical illness insurance\n\nCritical illness insurance, otherwise known as critical illness cover or a dread disease policy, is an insurance product in which the insurer is contracted to typically make a lump sum cash payment if the policyholder is diagnosed with one of the specific illnesses on a predetermined list as part of an insurance policy.\n\nThe policy may also be structured to pay out regular income and the payout may also be on the policyholder undergoing a surgical procedure, for example, having a heart bypass operation.\n\nThe policy may require the policyholder to survive a minimum number of days (the \"survival period\") from when the illness was first diagnosed. The survival period used varies from company to company, however, 14 days is the most typical survival period used. In the Australian market, survival periods are set between 8 – 14 days.\n\nThe contract terms contain specific rules that define when a diagnosis of a critical illness is considered valid. It may state that the diagnosis need be made by a physician who specialises in that illness or condition, or it may name specific tests, e.g. EKG changes of a myocardial infarction, that confirm the diagnosis.\n\nIn some markets, however, the definition of a claim for many of the diseases and conditions have become standardised, thus all insurers would use the same claims definition. The standardisation of the claims definitions may serve many purposes including increased clarity of cover for policyholders and greater comparability of policies from different life offices. For example, in the UK the Association of British Insurers (ABI) has issued a \"Statement of Best Practise\" which includes a number of standard definitions for common critical illnesses.\n\nThere are alternative forms of critical illness insurance to the lump sum cash payment model. These critical illness insurance policies directly pay health providers for the treatment costs of critical and life-threatening illnesses covered by the policyholder’s insurance policy, including the fee of specialists and procedures at a select group of high-ranking hospitals up to a certain amount per episode of treatment as set out in the policy.\n\nCritical illness insurance was founded by Dr Marius Barnard, with the first critical illness product being launched on 6 October 1983 in South Africa, under the name dread disease insurance.\n\nThis form of insurance originally covered four primary human health conditions:\n\n\nSince 1983, the cover has been accepted into many insurance markets around the world. Other names of the insurance cover include: trauma insurance, serious illness insurance and living assurance.\n\nThe schedule of insured illnesses varies between insurance companies. In 1983, four conditions were covered by the policy, i.e. heart attack, cancer, stroke and coronary artery by-pass surgery.\n\nExamples of other conditions that might be covered include:\n\n\nRef: Canada Life Critical Illness Insurance Policy \n\nDue to the fact that the incidence of a condition may decrease over time and both the diagnosis and treatment may improve over time, the financial need to cover some illnesses deemed critical a decade ago are no longer deemed necessary today. Likewise, some of the conditions covered today may no longer be needed a decade or so in the future.\n\nThe actual conditions covered depend on the market need for the cover, competition amongst insurers, as well as the policyholder's perceived value of the benefits offered. For these reasons conditions such as diabetes and rheumatoid arthritis, among others, may become the norm cover provided in the future.\n\nCritical illness cover was originally sold with the intention of providing financial protection to individuals following the diagnosis or treatment of an illness deemed critical. Critical illness may be purchased by individuals in conjunction with a life insurance or term assurance policy at the time of a residential purchase, known as a 'bolt-on' benefit.\n\nThe finances received could be used to:\n\n\nThis insurance can provide financial protection to the policyholder or their dependents on the repayment of a mortgage due to the policyholder contracting a critical illness condition or on the death of the policyholder. In this type of product design, some insurers may choose to structure the product to repay a portion of the outstanding mortgage debt on the contracting of a critical illness, whilst the full outstanding mortgage debt would be repaid on the death of the policyholder. Alternatively, the full sum assured may be paid on diagnosis of the critical illness, but then no further payment is made on death, effectively making the critical illness payment an 'accelerated death payment'.\n\nSome employers may also take out critical illness insurance for their employees. This contract would be in the form of a group contract and has become an essential strategy used by employers around the world to both protect their employees financially as well as attract more employees to consider working for the company.\n\nTypical critical illness insurance products refer to policies where the insurer pays the policyholder a pre-determined lump sum cash payment if the policyholder is diagnosed with a critical illness listed in the policy. However, alternative forms of critical illness cover provide direct payment to health providers to cover the high medical costs in treating critical illnesses such as cancer, cardiovascular procedures and organ transplants. The maximum amount is set out in the insurance policy and defined per episode of treatment.\n\nThese critical illness insurance products generally pay hospitals directly to avoid policyholder’s incurring out of pocket expenses and lengthy reimbursement processes. In most instances of this alternative to the lump sump critical illness insurance, policyholders may decide where they will receive treatment among a pre-selected group of hospitals.\n\nSome forms of critical illness insurance also offer policyholders the option to travel to highly specialised hospitals in other countries to receive treatment. These policies usually include travel and accommodation expenses for the policyholder and a companion, as well as other concierge services such as translators or personal nurses.\n\nApplicants are assessed for risk by a process of underwriting. Underwriting may take place in an automated underwriting computer filtering system. However the most detailed and holistic underwriting is still performed by experienced life insurance underwriters.\n\nThe underwriting process for critical illness is similar to life insurance underwriting in that it takes into account factors such as age, gender, smoking status, past medical history, family history, alcohol consumption, and body mass index. In the case of critical illness however, there is an increased emphasis on family history, smoking and bodymass index are risk factors that can demonstrate a marked increase risk with respect to critical illness cover.\n\nHaving underwritten an applicant in full, an underwriter can decide to accept the risk at the standard rate, or they may decide than an extra charge is warranted, or they may decide to apply exclusions of particular illnesses. If there is any amendment by an underwriter to the terms of acceptance, this has to be agreed by the applicant before the policy can proceed to issue.\n\nIn South Africa, the UK, Ireland, Australia and New Zealand, critical illness insurance has become a well established form of insurance.\n\nCritical illness insurance continues to grow in popularity and has recently been accepted into other territories including the far east and the United States.\n\nIn markets where the product is newer, many insurers choose to use the expertise of reinsurers with worldwide exposure as well as overseas insurers who have sold the product for a number of years. The expertise may come in the form of data provided as well as assistance with the product design features of the product.\n\nCritical Illness insurance, also known as Trauma Insurance in Australia is characterised by lump sum payments for listed medical events. Unlike in the United Kingdom, Trauma Insurance conditions are not standardised and market competition is based on both premium and policy definitions. It is not uncommon for an Australian Trauma Insurance policy to list 40+ definitions, including Cancer, Heart Attack, Strokes. Around 85% of Trauma Insurance claims paid in Australia are for either Cancer or Heart Disease. It is not uncommon for policies to also offer partial payments, if the condition suffered does not meet the full definition required for a full claim payout.\n\nTrauma Insurance policies in Australia are most commonly linked to Life Insurance policies, however can be taken as a stand-alone policy and where a Trauma Insurance policy is linked, it will normally deduct the balance of the insured Life Insurance amount.\n\nTrauma Insurance policies in Australia when used to provide personal protection, are generally not tax deductible and any claim proceeds are not taxable. Trauma Insurance is not offered in Superannuation as the definitions available for payment do not always align with the required conditions of release.\n\nCritical illness insurance options available in Canada:\n\n\n"}

They accomplish this by publicly raising their concerns either through direct correspondence (E.g. the Australian government, universities, etc.) or through media outlets. FSM was established in December 2011 by Loretta Marron, John Dwyer, Alastair MacLennan, Rob Morrison and Marcello Costa, a group of Australian biomedical scientists and clinical academics.\n\nTheir website publishes their principles.\n\nFriends of Science in Medicine advocate the cessation of those university complementary medicine courses that are not based on scientific principles nor supported by scientific evidence, although they do support research into alternative and complementary approaches where there is evidence for potential benefit. By April 2012 they had widened their focus from university education to the clinical practice, use and legitimacy of complementary medicine within Australian society. Entirely volunteer run, FSM was initially supported by a A$3,000 grant from the Australian Skeptics Science and Education Foundation(ASSEF).\n\nThroughout its history, FSM has been actively involved in a variety of medical policy issues surrounding evidence-based medicine and complementary and alternative medicine. They continue to appeal to the Australian Health Practitioner Regulation Agency, Medicare (Australia) and Australian tertiary education. to review current policies.\n\nFSM entered into the Australian media and promoted their message through \"The Sydney Morning Herald\", \"The Courier-Mail\" the Australian Broadcasting Corporation, \"The Conversation\", \"The Medical Journal of Australia\", the \"Australian Doctor\" magazine and regional radio stations. By May 2012 thirteen separate FSM discursive events created the unified message that all alternative and complementary medicines should be banned unless proven by rigorous scientific inquiry.\n\nIn September 2012 FSM was involved in lobbying the Australian Health Minister, Tanya Plibersek, to expand the chief medical officer's study into complementary medicine to include chiropractic and acupuncture. The group further demanded that all alternative medicines be taken off private health insurance which the Australian Government subsidizes. The Australian Government is currently examining the evidence of clinical efficacy, cost effectiveness, safety and quality of natural therapies. The result, expected in April 2015, will include a decision as to which natural therapies should continue to receive the rebate.\nThe therapies under review are those not provided by an accredited health professional, which are covered by private health insurance but not Medicare. In addition to homeopathy, they include iridology, aromatherapy, various kinds of massage, Buteyko, yoga and pilates.\n\nSeveral professional groups including the Australian Medical Association found that FSM had exceeded the boundaries of reasoned debate and risked compromising the values that the Friends of Science in Medicine claimed to support. The group underwent further criticism through editorials in \"The Medical Journal of Australia\" calling on the association to reverse its tactics.\n\nKerryn Phelps, former President of the Australian Medical Association, wrote the group had \"cast its net too wide\" in its condemnations, particularly in attacking courses in chiropractic, traditional Chinese medicine and Western herbalism. She further stated, \"there is evidence supporting CAM approaches. You also have to remember that a sizable part of what is done in mainstream medicine lacks robust evidence.\"\n\nPhelps, along with Stephen Myers, a Professor of Complementary Medicine and Director of the Natural Medicine Research Unit at Southern Cross University, in a 2012 editorial in \"The Medical Journal of Australia\" wrote, \"there is great danger for the public if complementary medicine practice is allowed to develop outside mainstream education.\" They wrote it would undermine \"safe practice and critical appraisal\", and stated there is now an extensive evidence base for complementary therapies available.\n\nIn an open letter on their website which was triggered by FSM's position on the proposed partnership between nutraceutical company Swisse and La Trobe University, the Australasian Integrative Medicine Association (AIMA) criticizes the FSM for not reaching out to AIMA or other complementary medicine organizations which, the AIMA states, would at least establish \"a more effective dialogue ...to improve the basis of health care and research for academics, medical professionals and the general population alike.\" They further state that \"FSM appear to be purposefully limiting their use of scientific scrutiny.\"\n\nThe following describes some of the initiatives and accomplishments of the Friends of Science in Medicine.\n\nAs a result of the efforts of John Dwyer and the Friends of Science in Medicine, in August 2013, the chairman of the Chiropractic Board of Australia said it had removed some courses from its approved training schedule and would be randomly auditing practitioners to ensure they were not making unsubstantiated claims about the benefits of chiropractic.\nIt also announced all registered chiropractors would be required to remove anti-vaccination claims from their websites.\n\nIn April 2013, Macquarie University began discussions with higher education providers to transfer its chiropractic degrees by 2015. Executive Dean of Science, Professor Clive Baldock said the initiative was first and foremost an academic one, based on a need for the Faculty of Science to build upon the University’s recent major strategic investments in research-intensive disciplines such as biomedical science and engineering.\n\nEarlier in 2013, FSM sent out a series of letters about inappropriate treatment of babies and children by chiropractors who claim that spinal manipulation helps health conditions such as Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, Asthma, allergies, bedwetting, colic and ear infection and is a substitute for vaccination. This was prompted in part by the report that government funding of chiropractic care for children under 14 was reported to have risen by 185% in four years. FSM sent letters to the Chiropractic and Osteopathic College of Australasia (COCA), Chiropractors' Association of Australia (CAA), Chiropractic Board of Australia (CBA), the Australian Spinal Research Foundation (ASRF), Chiropractic Council of NSW and Council on Chiropractic Education Australasia (CCEA). A second letter sent to the four universities teaching chiropractic, asking them to justify the 'subluxation' theory that is the foundation of chiropractic. The response by the CEO of Chiropractors' Association of Australia, Andrew Macnamara claims that there is no evidence provided to back up the concerns that chriropractic subluxations are an unjustified hypothesis, however there is evidence from a 2007 systematic review published in \"Pediatrics\" and a 2009 report by four chiropractors which would back up FSM concerns that subluxations are not causally related to disease and thus have no valid clinical applicability.\n\nIn March 2014, surgeon John Cunningham and FSM's Joanne Benhamu published an article in \"The Medical Journal of Australia\" calling for a national system for chiropractors to report adverse events in the wake of allegations that a four-month-old baby had a neck fracture following treatment for torticollis. The Chiropractors' Association of Australia responded by saying that it was in favor of a mandatory adverse reporting system but that it should apply to all health professions and be run through Australian Health Practitioners Regulation Agency (AHPRA).\n\nIn systematic reviews of randomised controlled trials, Cochrane Researchers examine recent evidence for the safety and effectiveness of therapies. Edzard Ernst conducted a systematic review of reviews in \"The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews\" (generally considered to be the most reliable source of evidence) in January 2010. Ernst's review, published in \"The Medical Journal of Australia\", concluded, \"The findings of currently available Cochrane reviews of studies of homeopathy do not show that homeopathic medicines have effects beyond placebo.\"\n\nCommenting in an article in \"The Guardian\" on a National Health and Medical Research Council (NHMRC) study (draft) debunking homeopathy, FSM co-founder John Dwyer stressed an area that was not investigated; the use of homeopathy for protection. Dwyer told \"The Guardian\", \"the most serious issue was the spreading of the concept that homeopathic vaccinations were harmless and just as good as orthodox vaccinations. People who believe that are not protecting themselves and their children.\"\n\nIn January 2014, La Trobe University formed a A$15M partnership with vitamin manufacturer Swisse Wellness, causing a wave of controversy in the Australian medical community. One month later, Ken Harvey, Adjunct Associate Professor at the School of Public Health at La Trobe, resigned his position, stating \"here were clear dangers in conducting research that was paid for by companies, and he could no longer be associated with the university given the 'fraught way' the research was being undertaken.\"\n\nIn light of this controversy, FSM wrote to the Australian Government's NHMRC, urging them to \"generate formal guidelines for research funding that would reflect the 'world’s best practices,' as this is needed to protect the credibility and integrity of contracted research, particularly where the results could affect the pecuniary interests of the funder.\" As a result, the NHMRC is reviewing the evidence for the effectiveness of homeopathy and released a resource for clinicians entitled \"Talking with your patients about Complementary Medicine – a Resource for Clinicians.\"\n\nLoretta Marron, CEO of FSM, was awarded a 2014 Medal (OAM) in the General Division of the Order of Australia \"for service to community health\". Marron has also received the Skeptic of the Year award three times from the Australian Skeptics who wrote she \"has made great contributions to public health and the exposure of dangerous and discredited treatments that profit through offering spurious cures to the vulnerable and ill.\"\n"}

It was first described in 1984.\n\nIts cause is unknown, but it is unrelated to capillary leak syndrome (which may cause similar swelling episodes) and eosinophilia-myalgia syndrome (which features eosinophilia but alternative symptoms). Some studies have shown that edema attacks are associated with degranulation (release of enzymes and mediators from eosinophils), and others have demonstrated antibodies against endothelium (cells lining blood vessels) in the condition.\n\nGleich's syndrome is not a form of the idiopathic hypereosinophilic syndrome in that there is little or no evidence that it leads to organ damage. Rather, recent studies report that a subset of T cells (a special form of lymphocyte blood cell) found in several Gleich syndrome patients have an abnormal immunophenotype, i.e. they express CD3-, CD4+ cluster of differentiation cell surface antigens. These same aberrant T cell immunophenotypes are found in lymphocyte-variant eosinophilia, a disease in which the aberrant T cells overproduce cytokines such as interleukin 5 which simulate the proliferation of eosinophil precursor cells and are thereby responsible for the eosinophilia. It is suggested that most forms of Gleich's syndrome are due to a similar aberrant T cell mechanism and are a subtype of lymphocyte-variant eosinophilia.\n\nGleich syndrome has a good prognosis. Attack severity may improve with steroid treatment.\n"}
{"id": "2118246", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2118246", "title": "Global health", "text": "Global health\n\nGlobal health is the health of populations in the global context; it has been defined as \"the area of study, research and practice that places a priority on improving health and achieving equity in health for all people worldwide\". Problems that transcend national borders or have a global political and economic impact are often emphasized. Thus, global health is about worldwide health improvement (including mental health), reduction of disparities, and protection against global threats that disregard national borders. Global health is not to be confused with international health, which is defined as the branch of public health focusing on developing nations and foreign aid efforts by industrialized countries. Global health can be measured as a function of various global diseases and their prevalence in the world and threat to decrease life in the present day.\n\nThe predominant agency associated with global health (and international health) is the World Health Organization (WHO). Other important agencies impacting global health include UNICEF and World Food Programme. The United Nations system has also played a part with cross-sectoral actions to address global health and its underlying socioeconomic determinants with the declaration of the Millennium Development Goals and the more recent Sustainable Development Goals.\n\nGlobal health employs several perspectives that focus on the determinants and distribution of health in international contexts:\n\n\nBoth individuals and organizations working in the domain of global health often face many questions regarding ethical and human rights. Critical examination of the various causes and justifications of health inequities is necessary for the success of proposed solutions. Such issues are discussed at the bi-annual Global Summits of National Ethics/Bioethics Councils, next in March 2016 in Berlin, with experts from WHO and UNESCO, by invitation of the German Ethics Council.\n\nThe 19th century held major discoveries in medicine and public health. The Broad Street cholera outbreak of 1854 was central to the development of modern epidemiology. The microorganisms responsible for malaria and tuberculosis were identified in 1880 and 1882, respectively. The 20th century saw the development of preventive and curative treatments for many diseases, including the BCG vaccine (for tuberculosis) and penicillin in the 1920s. The eradication of smallpox, with the last naturally occurring case recorded in 1977, raised hope that other diseases could be eradicated as well.\n\nImportant steps were taken towards global cooperation in health with the formation of the United Nations (UN) and the World Bank Group in 1945, after World War II. In 1948, the member states of the newly formed United Nations gathered to create the World Health Organization. A cholera epidemic that took 20,000 lives in Egypt in 1947 and 1948 helped spur the international community to action. The WHO published its Model List of Essential Medicines, and the 1978 Alma Ata declaration underlined the importance of primary health care.\n\nAt a United Nations Summit in 2000, member nations declared eight Millennium Development Goals (MDGs), which reflected the major challenges facing human development globally, to be achieved by 2015. The declaration was matched by unprecedented global investment by donor and recipient countries. According to the UN, these MDGs provided an important framework for development and significant progress has been made in a number of areas. However, progress has been uneven and some of the MDGs were not fully realized including maternal, newborn and child health and reproductive health. Building on the MDGs, a new Sustainable Development Agenda with 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) has been established for the years 2016-2030. The first goal being an ambitious and historic pledge to end poverty. On 25 September 2015, the 193 countries of the UN General Assembly adopted the 2030 Development Agenda titled \"Transforming our world: the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development\".\n\nIn 2015 a book titled \"To Save Humanity\" was published, with nearly 100 essays regarding today's most pressing global health issues. The essays were authored by global figures in politics, science, and advocacy ranging from Bill Clinton to Peter Piot, and addressed a wide range of issues including vaccinations, antimicrobial resistance, health coverage, tobacco use, research methodology, climate change, equity, access to medicine, and media coverage of health research.\n\nMeasures of global health include disability-adjusted life year (DALY), quality-adjusted life years (QALYs), and mortality rate.\n\nThe DALY is a summary measure that combines the impact of illness, disability, and mortality by measuring the time lived with disability and the time lost due to premature mortality. One DALY can be thought of as one lost year of \"healthy\" life. The DALY for a disease is the sum of the years of life lost due to premature mortality and the years lost due to disability for incident cases of the health condition.\n\nQALYs combine expected survival with expected quality of life into a single number: if an additional year of healthy life is worth a value of one (year), then a year of less healthy life is worth less than one (year). QALY calculations are based on measurements of the value that individuals place on expected years of survival. Measurements can be made in several ways: by techniques that simulate gambles about preferences for alternative states of health, with surveys or analyses that infer willingness to pay for alternative states of health, or through instruments that are based on trading off some or all likely survival time that a medical intervention might provide in order to gain less survival time of higher quality.\n\nInfant mortality and child mortality for children under age 5 are more specific than DALYs or QALYs in representing the health in the poorest sections of a population, and are thus especially useful when focusing on health equity.\n\nMorbidity measures include incidence rate, prevalence, and cumulative incidence, with incidence rate referring to the risk of developing a new health condition within a specified period of time. Although sometimes loosely expressed simply as the number of new cases during a time period, morbidity is better expressed as a proportion or a rate.\n\nThe diseases and health conditions targeted by global health initiatives are sometimes grouped under \"diseases of poverty\" versus \"diseases of affluence\", although the impact of globalization is increasingly blurring the lines between the two.\n\nInfections of the respiratory tract and middle ear are major causes of morbidity and mortality worldwide. Some respiratory infections of global significance include tuberculosis, measles, influenza, and pneumonias caused by pneumococci and \"Haemophilus influenzae\". The spread of respiratory infections is exacerbated by crowded conditions, and poverty is associated with more than a 20-fold increase in the relative burden of lung infections.\n\nDiarrhea is the second most common cause of child mortality worldwide, responsible for 17% of deaths of children under age 5. Poor sanitation can increase transmission of bacteria and viruses through water, food, utensils, hands, and flies. Dehydration due to diarrhea can be effectively treated through oral rehydration therapy with dramatic reductions in mortality. Important nutritional measures include the promotion of breastfeeding and zinc supplementation. While hygienic measures alone may be insufficient for the prevention of rotavirus diarrhea, it can be prevented by a safe and potentially cost-effective vaccine.\n\nComplications of pregnancy and childbirth are the leading causes of death among women of reproductive age in many developing countries: a woman dies from complications from childbirth approximately every minute. According to the World Health Organization's 2005 World Health Report, poor maternal conditions are the fourth leading cause of death for women worldwide, after HIV/AIDS, malaria, and tuberculosis. Most maternal deaths and injuries can be prevented, and such deaths have been largely eradicated in the developed world. Targets for improving maternal health include increasing the number of deliveries accompanied by skilled birth attendants.\n\n68 low-income countries tracked by the WHO- and UNICEF-led collaboration \"Countdown to 2015\" are estimated to hold for 97% of worldwide maternal and child deaths.\n\nThe HIV/AIDS epidemic has highlighted the global nature of human health and welfare and globalisation has given rise to a trend toward finding common solutions to global health challenges. Numerous international funds have been set up in recent times to address global health challenges such as HIV. Since the beginning of the epidemic, more than 70 million people have been infected with the HIV virus and about 35 million people have died of HIV. Globally, 36.9 million [31.1–43.9 million] people were living with HIV at the end of 2017. An estimated 0.8% [0.6-0.9%] of adults aged 15–49 years worldwide are living with HIV, although the burden of the epidemic continues to vary considerably between countries and regions. The WHO African region remains most severely affected, with nearly 1 in every 25 adults (4.1%) living with HIV and accounting for nearly two-thirds of the people living with HIV worldwide. Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) is transmitted through unprotected sex, unclean needles, blood transfusions, and from mother to child during birth or lactation. Globally, HIV is primarily spread through sexual intercourse. The risk-per-exposure with vaginal sex in low-income countries from female to male is 0.38% and male to female is 0.3%.The infection damages the immune system, leading to acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) and eventually, death. Antiretroviral drugs prolong life and delay the onset of AIDS by minimizing the amount of HIV in the body.\n\nMalaria is a mosquito-borne infectious disease caused by the parasites of the genus \"Plasmodium\". Symptoms may include fever, headaches, chills, and nausea. Each year, there are approximately 500 million cases of malaria worldwide, most commonly among children and pregnant women in developing countries. The WHO African Region carries a disproportionately high share of the global malaria burden. In 2016, the region was home to 90% of malaria cases and 91% of malaria deaths. The use of insecticide-treated bednets is a cost-effective way to reduce deaths from malaria, as is prompt artemisinin-based combination therapy, supported by intermittent preventive therapy in pregnancy. International travellers to endemic zones are advised chemoprophylaxis with antimalarial drugs like Atovaquone-proguanil, doxycycline, or mefloquine\n\nIn 2010, about 104 million children were underweight, and undernutrition contributes to about one third of child deaths around the world. (Undernutrition is not to be confused with \"malnutrition\", which refers to poor \"proportion\" of food intake and can thus refer to obesity.) Undernutrition impairs the immune system, increasing the frequency, severity, and duration of infections (including measles, pneumonia, and diarrhea). Infection can further contribute to malnutrition. Deficiencies of micronutrient, such as vitamin A, iron, iodine, and zinc, are common worldwide and can compromise intellectual potential, growth, development, and adult productivity. Interventions to prevent malnutrition include micronutrient supplementation, fortification of basic grocery foods, dietary diversification, hygienic measures to reduce spread of infections, and the promotion of breastfeeding.\n\nViolence against women has been defined as: \"physical, sexual and psychological violence occurring in the family and in the general community, including battering, sexual abuse of children, dowry-related violence, rape, female genital mutilation and other traditional practices harmful to women, non-spousal violence and violence related to exploitation, sexual harassment and intimidation at work, in educational institutions and elsewhere, trafficking in women, forced prostitution and violence perpetrated or condoned by the state.\" In addition to causing injury, violence may increase \"women’s long-term risk of a number of other health problems, including chronic pain, physical disability, drug and alcohol abuse, and depression\".\n\nAlthough statistics can be difficult to obtain as many cases go unreported, it is estimated that one in every five women faces some form of violence during her lifetime, in some cases leading to serious injury or even death. Risk factors for being a perpetrator include low education, past exposure to child maltreatment or witnessing violence between parents, harmful use of alcohol, attitudes accepting of violence and gender inequality. Equality of women has been addressed in the Millennium development goals.\n\nApproximately 80% of deaths linked to non-communicable diseases occur in developing countries.For instance, urbanization and aging have led to increasing poor health conditions related to non-communicable diseases in India. The fastest-growing causes of disease burden over the last 26 years were diabetes (rate increased by 80%) and ischemic heart disease (up 34%). More than 60% of deaths, about 6.1 million, in 2016 were due to NCDs, up from about 38% in 1990. Increases in refugee urbanization, has led to a growing number of people diagnosed with chronic noncommunicable diseases.\n\nIn September 2011, the United Nations is hosting its first General Assembly Special Summit on the issue of non-communicable diseases. Noting that non-communicable diseases are the cause of some 35 million deaths each year, the international community is being increasingly called to take measures for the prevention and control of chronic diseases and mitigate their impacts on the world population, especially on women, who are usually the primary caregivers.\n\nFor example, the rate of type 2 diabetes, associated with obesity, has been on the rise in countries previously plagued by hunger. In low-income countries, the number of individuals with diabetes is expected to increase from 84 million to 228 million by 2030. Obesity, a preventable condition, is associated with numerous chronic diseases, including cardiovascular conditions, stroke, certain cancers, and respiratory disease. About 16% of the global burden of disease, measured as DALYs, has been accounted for by obesity.\n\nMore than one billion people were treated for at least one neglected tropical disease in 2015. Neglected tropical diseases are a diverse group of infectious diseases that are endemic in tropical and subtropical regions of 149 countries, primarily effecting low and middle income populations in Africa, Asia, and Latin America. They are variously caused by bacteria (Trachoma, Leprosy), viruses (Dengue, Rabies), protozoa (Human African trypanosomiasis, Chagas), and helminths (Schistosomiasis, Onchocerciasis, Soil transmitted helminths). The Global Burden of Disease Study concluded that neglected tropical diseases comprehensively contributed to approximately 26.06 million disability-adjusted life years in 2010, as well as significant deleterious economic effects. In 2011, the World Health Organization launched a 2020 Roadmap for neglected tropical diseases, aiming for the control or elimination of 10 common diseases. The 2012 London Declaration builds on this initiative, and called on endemic countries and the international community to improve access to clean water and basic sanitation, improved living conditions, vector control, and health education, to reach the 2020 goals. In 2017, a WHO report cited 'unprecedented progress' against neglected tropical diseases since 2007, especially due to mass drug administration of drugs donated by pharmaceutical companies.\n\nGlobal interventions for improved child health and survival include the promotion of breastfeeding, zinc supplementation, vitamin A fortification, salt iodization, hygiene interventions such as hand-washing, vaccinations, and treatments of severe acute malnutrition. The Global Health Council suggests a list of 32 treatments and health interventions that could potentially save several million lives each year.\n\nMany populations face an \"outcome gap\", which refers to the gap between members of a population who have access to medical treatment versus those who do not. Countries facing outcome gaps lack sustainable infrastructure. In Guatemala, a subset of the public sector, the \"Programa de Accessibilidad a los Medicamentos\" (\"Program for Access to Medicines\"), had the lowest average availability (25%) compared to the private sector (35%). In the private sector, highest- and lowest-priced medicines were 22.7 and 10.7 times more expensive than international reference prices respectively. Treatments were generally unaffordable, costing as much as 15 days wages for a course of the antibiotic ceftriaxone. The public sector in Pakistan, while having access to medicines at a lower price than international reference prices, has a chronic shortage of and lack of access to basic medicines.\n\nJournalist Laurie Garrett argues that the field of global health is not plagued by a lack of funds, but that more funds do not always translate into positive outcomes. The problem lies in the way these funds are allocated, as they are often disproportionately allocated to alleviating a single disease.\n\nIn its 2006 World Health Report, the WHO estimated a shortage of almost 4.3 million doctors, midwives, nurses, and support workers worldwide, especially in sub-Saharan Africa.\n\nThe Global Health Security Agenda (GHSA) is \"a multilateral, multi-sector effort that includes 60 participating countries and numerous private and public international organizations focused on building up worldwide health security capabilities toward meeting such threats\" as the spread of infectious disease. On March 26-28, 2018, the GHSA held its last high-level meeting which was located in Tbilisi, Georgia on biosurveillance of infectious disease threats, \"which include such modern-day examples as HIV/AIDS, severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), H1N1 influenza, multi-drug resistant tuberculosis — any emerging or reemerging disease that threatens human health and global economic stability.\" This event brought together GHSA partner countries, contributing countries of Real-Time Surveillance Action Package, and international partner organizations supporting the strengthening of capacities to detect infectious disease threats within the Real-Time Surveillance Action Package and other cross-cutting packages. Georgia is the lead country for the Real-Time Surveillance Action Package.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1433722", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1433722", "title": "Gross National Happiness", "text": "Gross National Happiness\n\nGross National Happiness (also known by the acronym: GNH) is a philosophy that guides the government of Bhutan. It includes an index which is used to measure the collective happiness and well-being of a population. Gross National Happiness is instituted as the goal of the government of Bhutan in the Constitution of Bhutan, enacted on 18 July 2008.\n\nThe term \"Gross National Happiness\" was coined in 1972 during an interview by a British journalist for the Financial Times at Bombay airport when the then king of Bhutan, Jigme Singye Wangchuck, said \"Gross National Happiness is more important than Gross National Product.\"\n\nIn 2011, The UN General Assembly passed Resolution \"Happiness: towards a holistic approach to development\" urging member nations to follow the example of Bhutan and measure happiness and well-being and calling happiness a \"fundamental human goal.\"\n\nIn 2012, Bhutan's Prime Minister Jigme Thinley and the Secretary General Ban Ki-Moon of the United Nations convened the \"High Level Meeting: Well-being and Happiness: Defining a New Economic Paradigm\" to encourage the spread of Bhutan's GNH philosophy. At the High Level meeting, the first World Happiness Report was issued. Shortly after the High Level meeting, 20 March was declared to be International Day of Happiness by the UN in 2012 with resolution 66/28.\n\nBhutan's Prime Minister Tshering Tobgay proclaimed a preference for focus on more concrete goals instead of promoting GNH when he took office, but subsequently has protected the GNH of his country and promoted the concept internationally. Other Bhutanese officials also promote the spread of GNH at the UN and internationally.\n\nGNH is distinguishable from Gross Domestic Product by valuing collective happiness as the goal of governance, by emphasizing harmony with nature and traditional values as expressed in the 9 domains of happiness and 4 pillars of GNH. The four pillars of GNH's are 1) sustainable and equitable socio-economic development; 2) environmental conservation; 3) preservation and promotion of culture; and 4) good governance. The nine domains of GNH are psychological well-being, health, time use, education, cultural diversity and resilience, good governance, community vitality, ecological diversity and resilience, and living standards. Each domain is composed of subjective (survey-based) and objective indicators. The domains weigh equally but the indicators within each domain differ by weight.\n\nThe Gross National Happiness Commission is charged with implementing GNH in Bhutan. The GNH Commission is composed of the Secretaries each of the ministries of the government, the Prime Minister, and the Secretary of the GNH Commission. The GNH Commission's tasks include conceiving and implementing the nation's 5-year plan and promulgating policies. The GNH Index is used to measure the happiness and well-being of Bhutan's population. A GNH Policy Screening Tool and a GNH Project Screening Tool is used by the GNH commission to determine whether to pass policies or implement projects. The GNH Screening tools used by the Bhutanese GNH Commission for anticipating the impact of policy initiatives upon the levels of GNH in Bhutan.\n\nIn 2008, the first GNH survey was conducted. It was followed by a second one in 2010. The third nationwide survey was conducted in 2015. The GNH survey covers all twenty districts (Dzonkhag) and results are reported for varying demographic factors such as gender, age, abode, and occupation. The first GNH surveys consisted of long questionnaires that polled the citizens about living conditions and religious behavior, including questions about the times a person prayed in a day and other Karma indicators. It took several hours to complete one questionnaire. Later rounds of the GNH Index were shortened, but the survey retained the religious behavioral indicators.\n\nThe Bhutan GNH Index was developed by the Centre for Bhutan Studies with the help of the researchers from Oxford University researchers to help measure the progress of Bhutanese society. The Index function was based on Alkire & Foster method of 2011. After the creation of the national GNH Index, the government used the metric to measure national progress and inform policy.\n\nThe Bhutan GNH Index is considered to measure societal progress similarly to other models such as the Gross National Well-being of 2005, the OECD Better Life Index of 2011, and SPI Social Progress Index of 2013. One distinguishing feature of Bhutan GNH Index from the other models is that the other models are designed for secular governments and do not include religious behavior measurement components.\n\nThe data is used to compare the happiness between different groups of citizens, and changes over time.\n\nIn Victoria, British Columbia, Canada, a shortened version of Bhutan's GNH survey was used by the local government, local foundations and governmental agencies under the leadership of Martha and Michael Pennock to assess the population of Victoria.\n\nIn the state of São Paulo, Brazil, Susan Andrews, through her organization Future Vision Ecological Park, used a version of Bhutan's GNH at a community level in some cities.\n\nIn Seattle, Washington, United States, a version of the GNH Index was used by the Seattle City Council and Sustainable Seattle to assess the happiness and well-being of the Seattle Area population. Other cities and areas in North America, including Eau Claire, Wisconsin, Creston, British Columbia and the U.S. state of Vermont, also used a version of the GNH Index.\n\nAt the University of Oregon, United States, a behavioral model of GNH based on the use of positive and negative words in social network status updates was developed by Adam Kramer.\n\nIn 2016, Thailand launched its own GNH center. The former king of Thailand, Bhumibol Adulyadej, was a close friend of King Jigme Singye Wangchuck, and conceived the similar philosophy of Sufficiency Economy.\n\nIn the Philippines, the concept of GNH has been lauded by various personalities, notably Philippine senator and UN Global Champion for Resilience Loren Legarda, and former environment minister Gina Lopez. Bills have been filed in the Philippine Senate and House of Representatives in support of Gross National Happiness in the Philippines. Additionally, Executive Director of Bhutan’s GNH Center, Dr. Saamdu Chetri, has been invited by high-level officials in the Philippines for a GNH Forum.\n\nMany other cities and governments have undertaken efforts to measure happiness and well-being (also termed \"Beyond GDP\") since the High Level Meeting in 2012, but have not used versions of Bhutan's GNH index. Among these include the national governments of the United Kingdom's Office of National Statistics and the United Arab Emirates, and cities including Somerville, Massachusetts, United States, and Bristol, United Kingdom. Also a number of companies which are implementing sustainability practices in business have been inspired by GNH.\n\nGross National Happiness is also promoted in the United States by a nonprofit organization, Gross National Happiness USA. Headquartered in Vermont, GNHUSA is a 501c(3) tax-exempt non-profit organization with a mission to increase personal happiness and the collective wellbeing by changing how the United States measure their progress and success. GNHUSA was founded after Linda Wheatley of Montpelier, Vermont, attended the 2008 Annual Gross National Happiness Research Conference in Thimphu, Bhutan. Wheatley returned to Vermont determined to introduce the little-known GNH concepts to the general public in the U.S. After establishing the nonprofit in the spring of 2009, representatives of the group attended the fifth international GNH research conference in Brazil in November 2009 and, in June 2010, hosted the first US-based conference on Gross National Happiness and other alternative indicators, at Champlain College in Burlington, Vermont. In May of 2012, GNHUSA with co-sponsors organized Measure What Matters, a conference building a collaborative of data experts in Vermont. The state of Vermont's Governor declared April 13th (President Jefferson’s birthday) “Pursuit of Happiness Day,” and became the first state to pass legislation enabling development of alternative indicators and to assist in making policy. GNHUSA collaborates with the Vermont Data Center to perform a periodic study of well-being in the state, as a pilot for other states and municipalities. The organization also collaborates closely with the Happiness Alliance in collecting online GNH data, based on the domain of happiness developed by Bhutan. In 2017, GNHUSA initiated the process of establishing chapters in all 50 states to work with local governments and institutions on well-being initiatives, beginning with Wisconsin and North Carolina. \nThe organization also promotes the U.N.-designated International Happiness Day (March 20) as an opportunity to discuss the concepts of well-being with others at Happiness Dinners across the country.\n\nFrom August 25, 2012 to the present, GNHUSA has been carrying out a nationwide action research project, The Happiness Walk, carried out by GNHUSA board members and supporters. On the first leg, two GNHUSA board members walked 594 miles, from Vermont to Washington DC; the Walk most recently completed a leg from Santa Monica, CA to the Bay Area, with a side trip to Hawaii, and resumed March 1, 2018, walking from Petaluma CA to Seattle, Washington, on the 13th leg of the journey. Along the way, Walkers perform audio and video interviews and collect survey responses, introducing the concept of GNH and amassing data that will assist them in tailoring the GNH domains and indicators to American culture.\nGNHUSA also posts and promotes a Charter for Happiness which, as of May 7, 2018, has 469 signatories.\n\nGNH has been described by critics as a propaganda tool used by the Bhutanese government to distract from ethnic cleansing and human rights abuses it has committed.\n\nBhutanese democratic government began in 2008. Before that time the ethnic cleansing in Bhutan of non-Buddhist population of ethnic Nepalese of Hindu faith as a result of the GNH cultural preservation. The NGO Human Rights Watch documented the events. According to Human Rights Watch, \"Over 100,000 or 1/6 of the population of Bhutan of Nepalese origin and Hindu faith were expelled from the country because they would not integrate with Bhutan’s Buddhist culture.\" The Refugee Council of Australia stated that \"it is extraordinary and shocking that a nation can get away with expelling one sixth of its people and somehow keep its international reputation largely intact. The Government of Bhutan should be known not for Gross National Happiness but for Gross National Hypocrisy.\"\n\nSome researchers state that Bhutan's GNH philosophy “has evolved over the last decade through the contribution of western and local scholars to a version that is more democratic and open. Therefore, probably, the more accurate historical reference is to mention the coining of the GNH phrase as a key event, but not the Bhutan GNH philosophy, because the philosophy as understood by western scholars is different from the philosophy used by the King at the time.” Other viewpoints are that GNH is a process of development and learning, rather than an objective norm or absolute end point. Bhutan aspires to enhance the happiness of its people and GNH serves as a measurement tool for realizing that aspiration.\n\nOther criticism focuses on the standard of living in Bhutan. In an article written in 2004 in the Economist magazine, “The Himalayan kingdom of Bhutan is not in fact an idyll in a fairy tale. It is home to perhaps 900,000 people most of whom live in grinding poverty.\" Other criticism of GNH cites \"increasing levels of political corruption, the rapid spread of diseases such as aids and tuberculosis, gang violence, abuses against women and ethnic minorities, shortages in food/medicine, and economic woes.\"\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "19222718", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=19222718", "title": "HIV/AIDS in Honduras", "text": "HIV/AIDS in Honduras\n\nAccording to the Global Fund, Honduras is the Central American country most adversely affected by the HIV/AIDS epidemic. As of 1998, Honduras had the highest prevalence of HIV out of all seven Central American countries according to a study published by the office of the Honduran Secretary of Public Health. As of that same year, Hondurans made up only 17% of the Central American population, yet Honduras contained 50% of the initial AIDS cases in Central America and 60% of all Central American cases in 2001. In more recent years, new HIV infections have decreased by 29% since 2010 while AIDS-related deaths have increased by 11% since then. HIV/AIDS heavily affects the young, active, working population in Honduras, and HIV/AIDS deaths account for 10% of the overall national mortality rate. As of 2008, AIDS was the leading cause of death among Honduran women of childbearing age and the second-leading cause of hospitalization among both men and women. Sexually transmitted infections are common, and condom use in risky sexual encounters is sporadic and variable. HIV remains a mainly heterosexual epidemic in Honduras, as 90% of emerging infections are attributed to heterosexual transmission. It is estimated that the prevalence of HIV among Honduran adults is 1.5%. \n\nAccording to a 1998 report released by the office of the Honduran Secretary of Public Health, the incubation period, during which HIV/AIDS was first introduced into the Honduran population without being recognized, is estimated to have been during the end of the 1970s and into the early 1980s. In 1984, the first case of HIV/AIDS in Honduras was identified in a man who reported having travelled to San Francisco multiple times in the years preceding his diagnosis, which was confirmed in 1985 when he tested positive for Kaposi's sarcoma and antibodies for HIV. Four men, all reporting having traveled outside of the country, constituted the first cases recognized in Honduras. Three of those men were likely to have contracted HIV from homosexual transmission, while one contracted the virus likely from heterosexual transmission. \n\nBy 1992, the 100 Honduran cases of HIV/AIDS included almost every risk group associated with HIV/AIDS: men who have sex with men (MSM), men who have sex with men and women (MSM/W), commercial sex workers, children of HIV-positive mothers, intravenous drug users, and blood transfusion recipients. Since spreading to other populations, HIV/AIDS is considered to be transmitted mainly heterosexually in Honduras and thought to have been introduced to the heterosexual population through bisexual transmission. Additionally, groups such as marines and soldiers, who have increased interaction with the exterior and are also more likely to have multiple sexual partners, contributed to the spread of HIV/AIDS throughout Honduras. A 1997 study found prevalence of 6.8% among military recruits.\n\nThe areas most heavily affected by HIV/AIDS cases tend to be within what is called the Central Corridor of Development (\"Corridor Central de Desarrollo\"), affecting urban areas such as Tegucigalpa, San Pedro Sula, La Ceiba, El Progreso, Comayagua, Puerto Cortés, Tela, La Lima, and Choluteca. The disease originated in the northern part of the country, with especially high rates in Tegucigalpa and San Pedro Sula, which was the original epicenter of the disease. In San Pedro Sula, rates of HIV prevalence were estimated to be as high as 14 to 21% of the population at the height of the epidemic in Honduras. HIV/AIDS has since spread to the south, east, and west of Honduras, including the Honduran Bay Islands in the Caribbean, though these regions were affected later. Municipalities with the highest reported incidences of HIV infection are found on the border with neighboring countries El Salvador, Guatemala, and Nicaragua. On the northern coast of Honduras, the Garífuna minority group experiences particularly high rates of HIV prevalence.\n\nHIV/AIDS has most affected young people in Honduras, ranging from 20 to 39 years of age. The main risk groups associated with HIV/AIDS in Honduras are female sex workers (FSWs), men who have sex with men (MSM), the Garífuna community, prisoners, and transgender women.\n\nThe United Nations Joint Programme on AIDS (UNAIDS) released the following statistics regarding the HIV prevalence among different risk groups in Honduras:\n\n\nAdditionally, prevalence rates among prisoners have been found to be as high as 7.6%. In 2005 the national prevalence among sex workers was 9.68% according to a UNAIDS document on CONASIDA. 47% of the cases of HIV recorded in 2004 were women, and in that same year around 0.5% of women in antenatal surveillance studies were HIV positive. Overall, women account for more of emerging infections than men do.\n\nWhile it is not known exactly why the epidemic in Honduras became so severe, some experts, such as epidemiologists like Manuel Sierra, attribute its severity to the long incubation period of the disease in the country. Other reasons to which specialists attribute the state of the Honduran epidemic include increased international military presence due to the Cold War, during which Honduras experienced an influx of both international military personnel and also contras from neighboring Nicaragua, who helped to stimulate the commercial sex industry on a national level.\n\nThe Garífuna, of Afro-Caribbean descent, are one of at least eight minority groups within Honduras and one of the few for which HIV prevalence rates are known. Heterosexual transmission rates among the Garífuna are comparable to those of sub-Saharan Africa. As of 2005, the prevalence of HIV among the Garífuna was estimated to be somewhere between 8 and 14% of this population.\n\nAmong this population, condom use was reported in 2009 to be only 10.6% in stable couples and 41.4% in casual couples. HIV was higher among Garífunas residing in urban areas. In addition to low condom use and urban living, researchers suggest that the high rates of HIV prevalence may be due to the migratory working patterns of Garífuna men, who often travel seasonally to the United States or cities, such as San Pedro Sula where HIV prevalence is particularly high, for their jobs in shipping and fishing. Other possible contributing factors are sexual violence, the inability of women to control their sexual experiences, multiple sex partners, remuneration received for sex, with 6% of subjects reporting having received money for sex in a 2009 study, and first sexual encounters for men at 15 and women at 17.\n\nPrevalence among Garífuna was 3.8% among men and 5.1% among women as of 2006, indicating rates more than three times those of the national average. In a 2015 study, men were found to be more than four times as likely to have had multiple sex partners within the last 12 months than women. Garífuna women remain an especially disenfranchised group and have been subject to treatment methods as radical as forced sterilization. Only 9% of Garífuna men were reported to have been circumcised, which is proven to be a successful method at lowering risk of HIV contraction through heterosexual transmission by as much as 60%. High rates of other sexually transmitted infections (STIs) such as syphilis and herpes (HSV-2) were also found among the Garífuna in a 2009 study, and high rates of other STIs are linked to a higher risk of HIV infection.\n\nAlthough traditional health care is available to some within this community, the Garífuna have also developed their own methods of educating their community and spreading knowledge of prevention: utilizing their traditional musical forms to accompany informational plays about HIV/AIDS. Organizations, such as the Pan American Social Marketing Organization (PASMO), have adopted similar education tactics, such as bingo games in which each space on a playing card contains a picture of HIV/AIDS or another STD.\n\nNational efforts to reduce the number of new HIV infections have been in place since the late 1980s. The national response to HIV/AIDS has been led by the Ministry of Health, with collaboration from other ministries and several nongovernmental organizations (NGOs). The Health Secretariat solidified the creation of the National AIDS Control Program (PNS) between 1989 and 1994 in an effort to improve health infrastructure, create a national counseling network, and standardize treatment for Hondurans living with HIV/AIDS. During this same time period, the National AIDS Commission (COMSIDA) was also founded. Since the beginning of its involvement in preventing the spread of HIV, the Honduran government has sought to establish multi-sector programs, such as COMSIDA, which was reorganized in 1999 into CONASIDA, with fifteen national institutions or organizations represented. Similarly, the Strategic Plan for the Fight Against AIDS, in place from 1998 to 2002, included the response capabilities of both governmental and nongovernmental bodies and organizations. By the beginning of the 1990s, blood began to be screened for HIV on a national scale in Honduras, five years after the US began screening blood donations. HIV/AIDS cases due to blood transfusions began to decrease by 1991.\n\nHIV/AIDS was declared a national priority between 2002 and 2006 under President Ricardo Maduro, who publicly committed himself to support the national response to HIV/AIDS and identified HIV/AIDS as one of five health issues to receive priority government attention. \n\nCurrent programs focus on prevention, education, comprehensive care, and the rights of HIV-positive people. Prevention efforts, executed among various governmental and nongovernmental organizations like NGOs, churches, and schools, have specifically targeted groups especially at risk for HIV/AIDS, such as sex workers, members of the gay and lesbian community, mobile populations, and members of the Garífuna ethnic population. In the education system, teachers were trained in 2005 to educate their students about reproductive health, STIs, and HIV/AIDS, and these topics have become integrated into the national curriculum in Honduran schools. Despite these education and awareness efforts, in 2013, still around half of Hondurans infected were unaware they were living with HIV. Honduras’s long-term plan is to prevent new infections and to provide services to those who are most at risk for HIV infection, including young people, sex workers, men who have sex with men, institutionalized persons, and the Garífuna ethnic group. In 2017, the Ministry of Health resolved to cover all treatment for those living with HIV, regardless of CD4 count, and internal funding covers 95% and 70% of treatment costs and preventative efforts respectively.\n\nThe Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malariahas disbursed US$90,720,054 of the US$96,502,161 originally signed to Honduras for HIV/AIDS programs alone. According to USAIDS, another international body that supports programs addressing HIV/AIDS in Honduras, Global Fund programs have three main goals: to promote the protection of the rights of people living with HIV/AIDS (PLWHA), create awareness surrounding risks and risk-reducing measures among particularly vulnerable populations, and make health services more accessible to these populations.\n\nThe Joint United Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS (UNAIDS) has been another significant supporter of HIV/AIDS prevention, treatment, and care in Honduras. Other international bodies that have assisted programs in Honduras include the Swedish International Development Agency, Canadian International Development Agency, Department for International Development (United Kingdom), Humanist Institute for Development Cooperation, Christian Aid, Catholic Relief Services, German Cooperation Agency, Cooperative for American Relief Everywhere, Inc. (CARE), and the Red Cross. USAID programs include partnership directly with the Honduran government through projects such as AIDSTAR-One (AIDS Support and Technical Assistance Resources) but also include funding of individual, local organizations and NGOs, such as \"Fundación para el Fomento en Salud.\" Doctors Without Borders (\"Medecins sans Frotieres)\" has also been active in the country since 1974. Their HIV/AIDS programs in Honduras focus on antenatal care and their \"servicio prioritario\", or priority service, which consists of free and confidential post-exposure prophylaxis and psychological counseling to rape victims. As of 2017, Doctors Without Borders had provided 2,300 mental health consultations, 6,800 antenatal consultations, 800 postnatal consultations, assisted in 400 births, and treated 600 patients after experiences of sexual violence.\n\nAntiretroviral therapy was only offered in the Honduran public health system as of 2002. In 2001, 18 million lempiras were allocated to the purchase of ART in 2002, and the Honduran government aims to achieve universal ART access. Currently, the Honduran government spends 40 million lempiras annually to provide this treatment. In 2005, it was estimated that 4,500 people were receiving ART treatment, but CONASIDA estimated that only one-third of people with advanced HIV were actually receiving their drugs.\n\nBeyond simply providing the antiretroviral drugs themselves, programs such as the Inter-institutional Alliance for the Improved Nutrition of People Living with HIV/AIDS (IMANAS) have attempted to alleviate among households receiving ART the added stressor of lack of food, which can negatively impact people's ability to adhere to their ART regimens. Despite these efforts, in a study published in 2011, researchers found that 87% of households receiving ART in Honduras were food insecure, which was reflected by the 15% of these households in which ART adherence was inadequate.\n\nIn 2013, 42% of people were still accessing health care and receiving treatment after 12 months, and one in three patients had reached an undetectable viral load. As of 2016, 51% of Honduras affected by HIV/AIDS were able to receive antiretroviral treatment (ART), and 54% of HIV-positive pregnant women were receiving treatment or had utilized prophylaxis as a means of prevention of mother to child transmission (PMTCT). As of 2018, a total of 12,789 individuals were reported to be receiving ART, according to El Heraldo.\n\nThe Special Law on HIV/AIDS, passed by Congress and allowing CONASIDA to be formed in order to protect the rights of Hondurans living with HIV/AIDS, is attributed greatly to activism on the part of Hondurans living with HIV/AIDS and civil society workers in a 2005 special report created for the United Nations General Assembly Special Session on HIV/AIDS.\n\nThe Honduran National Association of People Living with HIV, in part facilitated by USAID funds, has served to empower those in Honduras living with HIV/AIDS and was established to protect their human rights. It was founded by Allan Dunaway, who also served as its president and give a face to HIV/AIDS in Honduras and essentially all of Latin America, as he was one of the first Latin American HIV/AIDS activists. He and his wife, Rosa González, were the first couple to publicly reveal their HIV-positive status. Together, they also founded \"Fundación Llaves\", and Dunaway worked directly with the National Commission of Human Rights (Comisionado Nacional de los Derechos Humanos). Representing their organization, Dunaway and his wife also traveled to the International AIDS Conference in New York City in 2008.\n\n"}

{"id": "1882151", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1882151", "title": "Health in Uganda", "text": "Health in Uganda\n\nHealth in Uganda refers to the health of the population of Uganda. As of 2013, life expectancy at birth in Uganda was 58 years, which was lower than in any other country in the East African Community except Burundi. As of 2015, the probability of a child dying before reaching age five was 5.5 percent (55 deaths for every 1000 live births). Total health expenditure as a percentage of gross domestic product (GDP) was 7.2 percent in 2014.\n\nIn 2015, an estimated 1.5 million people in Uganda were infected with HIV, and the HIV prevalence rate in the country was 7.2 percent.\n\nUganda was the most physically active nation in the world in 2018 according to the World Health Organization. Only 5.5% of Ugandans do not achieve 150 minutes of moderate-to-intense or 75 minutes of rigorous activity per week. Most work is still very physical, and commuting by vehicle is beyond the reach of most of the population. Kampala, however, is not freindly towards walking or cycling, and the air is very polluted. The Kampala Capital City Authority established the country's first cycle lane - 500 metres in Kololo - in 2018.\n\nAs of 2016, the five leading causes of death in Uganda included communicable diseases such as HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis, malaria, respiratory tract infections, and diarrheal diseases. The risk factors most responsible for death and disability include child and maternal malnutrition, unprotected sexual activity, multiple sex partners, contaminated water, poor sanitation, and air pollution.\n\nHIV treatment in Uganda has centered on human antiretroviral therapy through cross-training and increasing the scope of health workers who can administer treatment (e.g., community health workers and nurses). This shift in treatment occurred through the WHO's 2004 \"Integrated Management of Adult and Adolescent Illness\" guide. Studies of HIV-infected adults in Uganda showed risky sexual behavior to have declined, contributing to the decline in HIV incidence. From 1990 to 2004, HIV rates declined by 70 percent and casual sex declined by 60 percent. Health communication was also listed as a potential cause of inducing behavioral changes in the Ugandan population. According to a 2015 study, impediments to reducing HIV incidence include food insecurity in rural areas and stigma against HIV counseling and testing.\n\nUganda has the highest incidence rate of malaria in the world, with 478 people out of 1000 population being afflicted per year. According to WHO data published in May 2014, malaria accounted for 19,869 deaths in Uganda (6.19% of total deaths).\n\nIn 2002, the Ugandan government formalized the process of treating fevers through home-based care. Mothers who were able to better recognize symptoms of malaria took their children to a community medicine facility early in the illness. The Integrated Management of Childhood Illness allowed for better recognition of malaria's symptoms. Treatment either involved immediately taking the child to see a nearby healthcare worker or acquiring the treatment of chloroquine and SP, also known as Homapak, though kits have been found to be expired in some instances. However, resistance to HOMAPAK emerged, and drug recommendations by the WHO changed to artemisinin combination therapy (ACT). After the midterm review in 2014 of the national plan for malaria reduction and the malaria programme review in 2010, the national strategy to reduce malaria is being redesigned. Currently, Uganda is treating malaria through distribution of insecticide-treated nets, indoor spraying of insecticides, and preventative therapy for pregnant women. The disease burden of malaria, however, remains high and is further strengthened by inadequate resources, understanding of malaria, and increased resistance to drugs.\n\nReproductive health (RH) is a state of complete physical, mental, and social well-being in all matters relating to the reproductive system and to its functions and processes. It implies that people have the capability to reproduce and the freedom to decide if, when, and how often to do so. Implicit in this is the right of men and women to be informed and to have access to safe, effective, affordable, and acceptable methods of family planning of their choice, as well as other methods of their choice for regulation of fertility, which are not against the law, and the right of access to health care services that will enable women to go safely through pregnancy and childbirth. RH care also includes sexual health, the purpose of which is the enhancement of life and personal relations.\nThe World Health Organization (WHO) defines maternal health as the health of women during pregnancy, childbirth, and the postpartum period. According to UNICEF, Uganda's maternal mortality ratio, the annual number of deaths of women from pregnancy-related causes per 100,000 live births, was 440 from 2008 to 2012. The Millennium Development Goal (MDG) for 2015 concerning the maternal mortality ratio was 131 per 100,000 births. The MDG also set a goal for all births to be attended by a skilled health professional,\n\nIn rural areas, conceiving pregnant women seek the help of traditional birth attendants (TBAs) because of the difficulty in accessing formal health services and high transportation or treatment costs. TBAs are trusted as they embody the cultural and social life of the community. The TBAs' lack of knowledge and training and the use of traditional practices, however, have led to risky medical procedures resulting in high maternal mortality rates. Those rates also persist because of an overall low use of contraceptives, the limited capacity of health facilities to manage abortion/miscarriage complications, and the prevalence of HIV/AIDS among pregnant women. Despite malaria being one of the leading causes of morbidity in pregnant women, prevention and prophylaxis services are not well established according to a 2013 published report.\n\nOnly 47 percent of Ugandan women receive the recommended four antenatal care visits, and only 42 percent of births are attended by skilled health personnel. Among the poorest 20 percent of the population, the share of births attended by skill health personnel was 29 percent in 2005/2006 compared to 77 percent among the wealthiest 20 percent of the population.\n\nMalnutrition is a major development concern in Uganda, affecting all regions of the country and most segments of the population. The current levels of malnutrition hinder Uganda’s human, social, and economic development. Although the country has made tremendous progress in economic growth and poverty reduction over the past 20 years, its progress in reducing malnutrition remains very slow. The ultimate objective of the Uganda Nutrition Action Plan\n(UNAP) is to ensure that all Ugandans are properly nourished so they can live healthy and productive lives. However, it is at the start of life in particular that we must work together to ensure that all Ugandans are properly nourished.\nAccording to the three most recent Uganda Demographic Health Surveys (UDHS), nutrition indicators for young children and their mothers have not improved much over the past 15 years, with some indicators showing a worsening trend. For example, in 1995, 45 percent of children under 5 years old in Uganda were short for their age (stunted); 10 years later, the prevalence of stunted under-5s had fallen to only 39 percent (UDHS, 2006). Stunting indicates\nchronic malnutrition in children; the stunting prevalence rate of 39 percent means that about 2.3 million young children in Uganda today are chronically malnourished. UNICEF\n\nConsider the nutrition profile of Uganda for children under 5 years of age as per USAID \n\nThis has a huge burden on the country through lost income that directly affects the GDP where as much as 5.6% or US$899 million is lost annually. WFP \n\nDespite the worrying numbers, latest research shows that the numbers of children under 5 suffering from malnutrition are declining. \n\nDomestic violence (DV) is a key issue in reproductive health and rights. Most of the DV is gender-based. Physical violence is the most prevalent type of DV in Uganda, with one quarter of women reporting it. More than 60 percent of women who have ever been married have reported experiencing emotional, physical, or sexual violence from a spouse.\n\nIn 2011, about 2 percent of women reported to have undergone female genital mutilation, a practice that is dying away in the areas where it was more frequently practiced.\n\nNorthern Uganda is one of the four major administrative regions in Uganda. The region was devastated by a protracted civil war between the government of Uganda and the Lords Resistance Army as well as the cattle rustling conflict that lasted for 20 years.\n\nSince the war ended in 2006, the internally displaced person camps have been destroyed and people have resettled back to their former homesteads. The region, however, still has many health challenges, such as poor health care infrastructure and inadequate staffing at all levels (2008 published report); lack of access to the national electricity grid (2007 published report); an inability to attract and retain qualified staff; frequent stock outs in the hospitals and health facilities; emerging and re-emerging diseases such as Ebola, nodding syndrome, onchocerciasis, and tuberculosis; proneness to malaria epidemics, the leading cause of death in the country; reintegration of former abducted child soldiers who returned home (2007 study); lack of safe drinking water as most boreholes were destroyed during the war; the HIV/AIDS epidemic (2004 published report); poor education standards with high failure rates in primary and secondary school national examinations (2015 published report); and poverty (2013 published report).\n\nUganda has been hosting refugees and asylum seekers since achieving its independence in 1962.In fact, the 2016 United Nations Summit for Refugees declared Uganda’s refugee policy a model. The 2006 Refugee Act and 2010 Refugee Regulations allow for integration of refugees within host communities with refugees\nhaving access to the same public services as nationals. They have freedom of movement and are free to pursue livelihood opportunities, including access\nto the labour market and to establish businesses.\nUganda is currently hosting 1,252,470 refugees and asylum seekers making it the largest refugee hosting country in Africa and the third largest in the world (GoU and UNHCR, 2017) UNDP . This has placed a huge burden on the country that has GDP of just 710 dollars, yet the aid received per person is very small. \"Aid received per person against income\" \nCost disaggregated by sector\n\nThere are regular outbreaks of diseases such as cholera, ebola and marburg. 2017 Uganda Marburg virus outbreak. The policy of allowing refugees to freely move within the country increases the risk of spreading these outbreaks beyond refugee camp borders.\n\nAccording to the 2015 Uganda Bureau of Statistics (UBOS) report:\n\n\n\n"}

He enrolled at the public college preparatory school, the National College of Buenos Aires and by 1900, became affiliated with the Radical Civic Union (UCR) - then the nation's leading advocacy group for universal male suffrage. He then headed the school's UCR chapter and published its newsletter.\n\nTamborini received a medical degree from the University of Buenos Aires and by 1912, headed that city's UCR committee. That year, free and fair elections guaranteed by the landmark Sáenz Peña Law led to the victory of numerous UCR candidates for the Argentine Congress, including Tamborini. Following the election to the presidency of longtime UCR leader Hipólito Yrigoyen in 1916, however, Tamborini aligned himself against what a faction in the UCR viewed as the president's growing personality cult. This opposition was fueled by Yrigoyen's numerous removals of provincial governors, for instance, and soon became known as \"anti-personalism.\"\n\nThe election of a diplomat with anti-personalist sympathies, Marcelo Torcuato de Alvear, as president in 1922 led to a division in the UCR. Congressman Tamborini joined Senate President Leopoldo Melo and others in the formation of the Antipersonalist UCR in 1924. President Alvear named Tamborini Interior Minister (overseeing law enforcement), in 1925. The aging Yrigoyen returned to power in 1928, deeping inter-party divisions; but his 1930 overthrow helped unify the UCR, and Tamborini joined the City Hotel Declaration of April 1931 to that effect.\n\nSeeking to thwart a UCR victory ahead of the 1931 elections, the dictator, General José Félix Uriburu jailed much of its leadership - including Alvear and Tamborini. Freed after the election (which the UCR boycotted), Tamborini was returned to Congress in 1934 and stood for the UCR nomination in 1937; but he was defeated by Alvear. Elected Senator in 1940, he became the dominant figure in the UCR following Alvear's death in 1942.\n\nA coup d'état in 1943 led to rise of the populist new Labor Minister, Col. Juan Perón. Forcing the junta to call elections for early 1946, Perón's populism and anti-U.S. sentiment rallied an unusually diverse opposition against him. Tamborini led the majority of the UCR, the reformist Democratic Progressive Party, Socialists, Communists and the conservative National Democrats (part of the Concordance that kept the UCR from power by \"patriotic fraud\" in the 1930s) into a Democratic Union. Joined by interests in the financial sector and the chamber of commerce, the alliance also enjoyed the support of U.S. Ambassador Spruille Braden, and was united solely by the goal of keeping Perón from the Casa Rosada. Organizing a massive kick-off rally in front of Congress on December 8, the Democratic Union nominated Tamborini and his fellow political prisoner in 1931: former Congressman Enrique Mosca. The alliance, however, failed to win over several prominent lawmakers opposed the Union's ties to conservative interests. Ambassador Braden's leak of a white paper accusing Perón of fascist ties and his addressing Democratic Union rallies in person backfired, moreover. Perón seized on this to make the election a choice between \"Perón or Braden,\" while prevailing on President Edelmiro Farrell to enact his populist agenda and dismissing Tamborini and Mosca as \"the tambourine and the fly.\" The Democratic Union was defeated by 11%. \n\nTamborini was unable to return to prominence following his break with less conservative UCR figures during that election. He ran once again for his party's nomination in 1951; but he lost to Congressman Ricardo Balbín. President Perón was overwhelmingly reelected, though on September 19, 1955, he was violently overthrown. The ailing Dr. Tamborini died a week later, at age 69.\n"}

The word is most often used for the offspring of mammals, but can be used for any animal that gives birth to multiple young. In comparison, a group of eggs and the offspring that hatch from them are frequently called a clutch, while young birds are often called a brood. Animals from the same litter are referred to as litter-mates.\n\nAnimals frequently display grouping behavior in herds, swarms, flocks, or colonies, and these multiple births derive similar advantages. A litter offers some protection from predation, not particularly to the individual young but to the parents' investment in breeding. With multiple young, predators could eat several and others could still survive to reach maturity, but with only one offspring, its loss could mean a wasted breeding season. The other significant advantage is the chance for the healthiest young animals to be favored from a group. Rather than it being a conscious decision on the part of the parents, the fittest and strongest baby competes most successfully for food and space, leaving the weakest young, or runts, to die through lack of care.\n\nIn the wild, only a small percentage, if any, of the litter may survive to maturity, whereas for domesticated animals and those in captivity with human care the whole litter almost always survives. Kittens and puppies are in this group. Carnivores, rodents, and pigs usually have litters, while primates and larger herbivores usually have singletons.\n"}

They include dental infection, dental abscess, and Ludwig's angina. Mouth infections typically originate from dental caries at the root of molars and premolars that spread to adjacent structures. In immunocompetent patients with minimal spread of disease, removing the offending tooth to allow drainage will usually resolve the infection. In cases that spread to adjacent structures or in immunocompromised patients (cancer, diabetes, transplant immunosuppression), surgical drainage and systemic antibiotics may be required in addition to tooth extraction. Since bacteria that normally reside in the oral cavity cause mouth infections, proper dental hygiene can prevent most cases of infection. As such, mouth infections are more common in populations with poor access to dental care (homeless, uninsured, etc.) or populations with health-related behaviors that damage one's teeth and oral mucosa (tobacco, methamphetamine, etc).\n\nPatients with mouth infections usually complain of pain at the affected tooth with or without fevers. Inability to fully open one's mouth, also known as trismus, suggests that the infection has spread to spaces between the jaw and muscles of mastication (masseter, medial pterygoid, and temporalis). If an abscess has formed, swelling, redness, and tenderness will be present. Depending on the location of the abscess, it will be visible intraorally, extraorally, or both. Severe infections with significant swelling may cause airway obstruction by shifting/enlarging soft tissue structures (floor of mouth, tongue, etc.) or by causing dysphagia that prevents adequate clearance of saliva. This is a medical emergency and may require endonasal intubation or tracheotomy to protect one's airway. The development of stridor, shortness of breath, and pooling oral secretions may indicate impending airway compromise due to a worsening mouth infection. Other rare but dangerous complications include osteomyelitis, cavernous sinus thrombosis, and deep neck space infection.\n\nAnatomy of the oral cavity is important because the original site of infection relative to its surrounding structures dictates the spread of disease.\n"}

Under the \"cash and carry system\", the health need of an individual was only attended to after initial payment for the service was made. Even in cases when patients had been brought into the hospital on emergencies it was required that money was paid at every point of service delivery.\n\nUpon becoming president, former president Kufuor pushed through his idea of getting rid of “cash and carry” and replacing it with an equitable insurance scheme that ensured that treatment was provided first before payment for Ghanaian citizens. In 2003, the scheme was passed into law. Under the law, there was the establishment of Ghana National Health Insurance Authority which licenses, monitors and regulates the operation of health insurance schemes in Ghana. Like many countries in the world, Ghana's health insurance was fashioned out to meet specific needs of Ghanaian citizens.\n\nThe National Health Insurance Scheme is a form of National health insurance established by the Government of Ghana. The scheme provides equitable access and financial coverage for basic health care services to the Ghanaian population. The objective of the NHIC is to secure the implementation of the national health insurance policy that ensures access to basic healthcare services to all residents of Ghana.\n\nThe health insurance was set up to allow Ghanaian citizens to make contributions into a fund so that in the event of illness Ghanaian contributors could be supported by the fund to receive affordable health care. Under this policy, three types of health insurance schemes were set up. They were:\n\nIn order for the system to function well, the government decided to support the District Mutual Health Insurance Scheme concept to ensure that:\n\nLike all insurance schemes, different types of premiums are available under the country's NHIS. Ghanaian contributors are grouped according to their levels of income. Based on the group a Ghanaian contributor may fall in, there is specific premium that ought to be paid. This was done since the socio-economic condition scheme contributors is not the same and the Ghanaian contributions was to be affordable for all to ensure that nobody is forced to remain in \"cash and carry\" system. This meant that Ghanaian contributions payable could vary from one district to the other as even the disease burden was also not the same in all the districts. To ensure that all Ghanaian citizens made some contribution to the scheme, a 2.5% Health Insurance Levy on selected goods and services was passed into law so that the money collected could be put into a National Health Insurance Fund to subsidize fully paid contributions to the District Health Insurance Schemes.\n\nIn order to ensure the continuity of the scheme, two major lists were made. One had the all the conditions that the scheme could cover with the other the excluded conditions.\n\nThe Government came out with a minimum benefit package of diseases which every district-wide scheme was to cover for Ghanaian citizens. This package covered about 95% of diseases in Ghana. Diseases covered included among others:\nHowever, all district-wide schemes were given the right under the law to organise their schemes to cover as many diseases and services for Ghanaian citizens as they desire, provided it was approved by the National Health Insurance Council.\n\nCertain diseases were however excluded from the benefit package because it was considered to be too expensive to treat. Therefore, other arrangements had to be considered to enable Ghanaian citizens get these diseases treated. Diseases currently not covered are:\nAll these constitute only 5% of the total number of diseases that Ghanaian citizens suffered from.\n\nThe government supports all 212 Districts, Municipal and Sub-metro schemes in Ghana for Ghanaian citizens to the various districts to facilitate the set-up of the schemes.\n\nSince the inception of the scheme in 2003, there have been a lot of controversies surrounding its operation and purpose. The first one was to do with members of the opposition National Democratic Congress (NDC), whose members claimed that the scheme was one made for members of the then ruling New Patriotic Party (NPP). As such many members of NDC did not want to register with the scheme. The reverse of all the propaganda that surrounded the scheme at its inception were revisited in 2009 when the NDC took over power.\nCurrently, the controversy with the scheme has to do with the proposed one-time premium payment. This idea was included in the ruling party's manifesto. The promise has so far not come into fruition as the date for its implementation is constantly postponed. Many critics of the proposal claim that it is just not possible to support the scheme with a one-time premium since the sustainability of the scheme would not be possible if premiums were not paid yearly.\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "142821", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=142821", "title": "Placebo", "text": "Placebo\n\nA placebo ( ) is a substance or treatment of no intended therapeutic value. Common placebos include inert tablets (like sugar pills), inert injections (like saline), sham surgery, and other procedures.\n\nIn drug testing and medical research, a placebo can be made to resemble an active medication or therapy so that it functions as a control; this is to prevent the recipient(s) or others from knowing (with their consent) whether a treatment is active or inactive, as expectations about efficacy can influence results. In a clinical trial any change in the placebo arm is known as the placebo response, and the difference between this and the result of no treatment is the placebo effect.\n\nA placebo may be given to a person in a clinical context in order to deceive the recipient into thinking that it is an active treatment. The use of placebos as treatment in clinical medicine is ethically problematic as it introduces deception and dishonesty into the doctor–patient relationship. Placebos have no impact on disease itself; they can only affect the person's perception of their own condition.\n\nHistorically, an influential 1955 study entitled \"The Powerful Placebo\" established the idea that placebo effects were clinically important, and were a result of the brain's role in physical health, but a 1997 review of the study found \"no evidence [...] of any placebo effect in any of the studies cited\". Subsequent research has found that placebos are not a useful means of therapy.\n\nThe word \"placebo\", Latin for \"I will please\", dates back to a Latin translation of the Bible by St Jerome.\n\nThe American Society of Pain Management Nursing define a placebo as \"any sham medication or procedure designed to be void of any known therapeutic value\".\n\nIn a clinical trial, a \"placebo response\" is the measured response of subjects to a placebo; the \"placebo effect\" is the difference between that response, and no treatment. It is also part of the recorded response to any active medical intervention.\n\nAny measurable placebo effect is termed either \"objective\" (e.g. lowered blood pressure) or \"subjective\" (e.g. a lowered perception of pain).\n\nPlacebos have no meaningful therapeutic worth. They have no effect on disease, and can only affect some people's subjective judgement of their symptoms. Sometimes they can make people feel better, and sometimes worse – in which case they are termed a nocebo.\n\nBecause the placebo response is simply the patient response that cannot be attributed to an investigational intervention, there are multiple possible components of a measured placebo effect. These components have varying relevance depending on study design and the types of observations. While there is some evidence that placebo interventions can alter levels of endocannabinoids or endogenous opioids, other prominent components include expectancy effects, regression to the mean, and flawed research methodologies.\n\nChildren seem to have greater response than adults to placebos.\n\nA review published in \"JAMA Psychiatry\" found that, in trials of antipsychotic medications, the change in response to receiving a placebo had increased significantly between 1960 and 2013. The review's authors identified several factors that could be responsible for this change, including inflation of baseline scores and enrollment of fewer severely ill patients. Another analysis published in \"Pain\" in 2015 found that placebo responses had increased considerably in neuropathic pain clinical trials conducted in the United States from 1990 to 2013. The researchers suggested that this may be because such trials have \"increased in study size and length\" during this time period.\n\nA 2010 Cochrane review suggests that placebo effects are only apparent in subjective, continuous measures, and in the treatment of pain and related conditions.\n\nPlacebos are believed to be capable of altering a person's perception of pain. \"A person might reinterpret a sharp pain as uncomfortable tingling.\"\n\nOne way in which the magnitude of placebo analgesia can be measured is by conducting \"open/hidden\" studies, in which some patients receive an analgesic and are informed that they will be receiving it (open), while others are administered the same drug without their knowledge (hidden). Such studies have found that analgesics are considerably more effective when the patient knows they are receiving them.\n\nIn 2008, a controversial meta-analysis led by psychologist Irving Kirsch, analyzing data from the FDA, concluded that 82% of the response to antidepressants was accounted for by placebos. However, there are serious doubts about the used methods and the interpretation of the results, especially the use of 0.5 as cut-off point for the effect-size. A complete reanalysis and recalculation based on the same FDA data discovered that the Kirsch study suffered from \"important flaws in the calculations\". The authors concluded that although a large percentage of the placebo response was due to expectancy, this was not true for the active drug. Besides confirming drug effectiveness, they found that the drug effect was not related to depression severity.\n\nAnother meta-analysis found that 79% of depressed patients receiving placebo remained well (for 12 weeks after an initial 6–8 weeks of successful therapy) compared to 93% of those receiving antidepressants. In the continuation phase however, patients on placebo relapsed significantly more often than patients on antidepressants.\n\nIt was previously assumed that placebo response rates in patients with chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS) are unusually high, \"at least 30% to 50%\", because of the subjective reporting of symptoms and the fluctuating nature of the condition. According to a meta-analysis and contrary to conventional wisdom, the pooled response rate in the placebo group was 19.6%, even lower than in some other medical conditions. The authors offer possible explanations for this result: CFS is widely understood to be difficult to treat, which could reduce expectations of improvement. In context of evidence showing placebos do not have powerful clinical effects when compared to no treatment, a low rate of spontaneous remission in CFS could contribute to reduced improvement rates in the placebo group. Intervention type also contributed to the heterogeneity of the response. Low patient and provider expectations regarding psychological treatment may explain particularly low placebo responses to psychiatric treatments.\n\nA phenomenon opposite to the placebo effect has also been observed. When an inactive substance or treatment is administered to a recipient who has an expectation of it having a \"negative\" impact, this intervention is known as a nocebo (Latin \"nocebo\" = \"I shall harm\"). A nocebo effect occurs when the recipient of an inert substance reports a negative effect or a worsening of symptoms, with the outcome resulting not from the substance itself, but from negative expectations about the treatment.\n\nAnother negative consequence is that placebos can cause side-effects associated with real treatment.\n\nWithdrawal symptoms can also occur after placebo treatment. This was found, for example, after the discontinuation of the Women's Health Initiative study of hormone replacement therapy for menopause. Women had been on placebo for an average of 5.7 years. Moderate or severe withdrawal symptoms were reported by 4.8% of those on placebo compared to 21.3% of those on hormone replacement.\n\nKnowingly giving a person a placebo when there is an effective treatment available is a bioethically complex issue. While placebo-controlled trials might provide information about the effectiveness of a treatment, it denies some patients what could be the best available (if unproven) treatment. Informed consent is usually required for a study to be considered ethical, including the disclosure that some test subjects will receive placebo treatments.\n\nThe ethics of placebo-controlled studies have been debated in the revision process of the Declaration of Helsinki. Of particular concern has been the difference between trials comparing inert placebos with experimental treatments, versus comparing the best available treatment with an experimental treatment; and differences between trials in the sponsor's developed countries versus the trial's targeted developing countries.\n\nSome suggest that existing medical treatments should be used instead of placebos, to avoid having some patients not receive medicine during the trial.\n\nCritics of the practice responded that it is unethical to prescribe treatments that do not work, and that telling a patient (as opposed to a research test subject) that a placebo is a real medication is deceptive and harms the doctor–patient relationship in the long run. Critics also argued that using placebos can delay the proper diagnosis and treatment of serious medical conditions. While some say that blanket consent, or the general consent to unspecified treatment given by patients beforehand, is ethical, others argue that patients should always obtain specific information about the name of the drug they are receiving, its side effects, and other treatment options. This view is shared by some on the grounds of patient autonomy. There are also concerns that legitimate doctors and pharmacists could open themselves up to charges of fraud or malpractice by using a placebo.\n\nAbout 25% of physicians in both the Danish and Israeli studies used placebos as a diagnostic tool to determine if a patient's symptoms were real, or if the patient was malingering. Both the critics and defenders of the medical use of placebos agreed that this was unethical. The \"British Medical Journal\" editorial said, \"That a patient gets pain relief from a placebo does not imply that the pain is not real or organic in origin...the use of the placebo for 'diagnosis' of whether or not pain is real is misguided.\"\n\nReferring specifically to homeopathy, the House of Commons of the United Kingdom Science and Technology Committee has stated:\n\nA survey in the United States of more than 10,000 physicians came to the result that while 24% of physicians would prescribe a treatment that is a placebo simply because the patient wanted treatment, 58% would not, and for the remaining 18%, it would depend on the circumstances.\n\nExpectation plays a clear role. A placebo presented as a stimulant may trigger an effect on heart rhythm and blood pressure, but when administered as a depressant, the opposite effect.\n\nIn psychology, the two main hypotheses of placebo effect are expectancy theory and classical conditioning.\n\nIn 1985, Irving Kirsch hypothesized that placebo effects are produced by the self-fulfilling effects of response expectancies, in which the belief that one will feel different leads a person to actually feel different. According to this theory, the belief that one has received an active treatment can produce the subjective changes thought to be produced by the real treatment. Placebos can act similarly through classical conditioning, wherein a placebo and an actual stimulus are used simultaneously until the placebo is associated with the effect from the actual stimulus. Both conditioning and expectations play a role in placebo effect, and make different kinds of contribution. Conditioning has a longer-lasting effect, and can affect earlier stages of information processing. Those that think that a treatment will work display a stronger placebo effect than those that do not, as evidenced by a study of acupuncture.\n\nAdditionally, motivation may contribute to the placebo effect. The active goals of an individual changes their somatic experience by altering the detection and interpretation of expectation-congruent symptoms, and by changing the behavioral strategies a person pursues. Motivation may link to the meaning through which people experience illness and treatment. Such meaning is derived from the culture in which they live and which informs them about the nature of illness and how it responds to treatment.\n\nFunctional imaging upon placebo analgesia suggests links to the activation, and increased functional correlation between this activation, in the anterior cingulate, prefrontal, orbitofrontal and insular cortices, nucleus accumbens, amygdala, the brainstem periaqueductal gray matter, and the spinal cord.\n\nIt has been known that placebo analgesia depends upon the release in the brain of endogenous opioids since 1978. Such analgesic placebos activation changes processing lower down in the brain by enhancing the descending inhibition through the periaqueductal gray on spinal nociceptive reflexes, while the expectations of anti-analgesic nocebos acts in the opposite way to block this.\n\nFunctional imaging upon placebo analgesia has been summarized as showing that the placebo response is \"mediated by \"top-down\" processes dependent on frontal cortical areas that generate and maintain cognitive expectancies. Dopaminergic reward pathways may underlie these expectancies\". \"Diseases lacking major 'top-down' or cortically based regulation may be less prone to placebo-related improvement\".\n\nIn conditioning, a neutral stimulus saccharin is paired in a drink with an agent that produces an unconditioned response. For example, that agent might be cyclophosphamide, which causes immunosuppression. After learning this pairing, the taste of saccharin by itself is able to cause immunosuppression, as a new conditioned response via neural top-down control. Such conditioning has been found to affect a diverse variety of not just basic physiological processes in the immune system but ones such as serum iron levels, oxidative DNA damage levels, and insulin secretion. Recent reviews have argued that the placebo effect is due to top-down control by the brain for immunity and pain. Pacheco-López and colleagues have raised the possibility of \"neocortical-sympathetic-immune axis providing neuroanatomical substrates that might explain the link between placebo/conditioned and placebo/expectation responses.\" There has also been research aiming to understand underlying neurobiological mechanisms of action in pain relief, immunosuppression, Parkinson's disease and depression.\n\nDopaminergic pathways have been implicated in the placebo response in pain and depression.\n\nPlacebo-controlled studies, as well as studies of the placebo effect itself, often fail to adequately identify confounding factors. False impressions of placebo effects are caused by many factors including:\n\n\nThe word placebo was used in a medicinal context in the late 18th century to describe a \"commonplace method or medicine\" and in 1811 it was defined as \"any medicine adapted more to please than to benefit the patient\". Although this definition contained a derogatory implication it did not necessarily imply that the remedy had no effect.\n\nPlacebos have featured in medical use until well into the twentieth century. In 1955 Henry K. Beecher published an influential paper entitled \"The Powerful Placebo\" which proposed idea that placebo effects were clinically important. Subsequent re-analysis of his materials, however, found in them no evidence of any \"placebo effect\".\n\nThe placebo effect makes it more difficult to evaluate new treatments. Clinical trials control for this effect by including a group of subjects that receives a sham treatment. The subjects in such trials are blinded as to whether they receive the treatment or a placebo. If a person is given a placebo under one name, and they respond, they will respond in the same way on a later occasion to that placebo under that name but not if under another.\n\nClinical trials are often double-blinded so that the researchers also do not know which test subjects are receiving the active or placebo treatment. The placebo effect in such clinical trials is weaker than in normal therapy since the subjects are not sure whether the treatment they are receiving is active.\n\n"}

{"id": "54638010", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=54638010", "title": "Psychographic segmentation", "text": "Psychographic segmentation\n\nPsychographic segmentation has been used in marketing research as a form of market segmentation which divides consumers into sub-groups based on shared psychological characteristics, including subconscious or conscious beliefs, motivations, and priorities to explain and predict consumer behavior. Developed in the 1970´s, it applies behavioral and social sciences to explore to understand consumers’ decision-making processesconsumer attitudes, values, personalities, lifestyles, and communication preferences. It complements demographic and socioeconomic segmentation, and enables marketers to target audiences with messaging to market brands, products or services. When attitudes,motivations, personality characteristics and belief systems are analyzed statistically to determine groups with substantially different attitudes, the result is psychographic segmentation psychographic segmentation will help advertisers to target the most receptive audience for their message.Some consider lifestyle segmentation to be interchangeable with psychographic segmentation, marketing experts argue that lifestyle relates specifically to overt behaviors while psychographics relate to consumers' cognitive style, which is based on their \"patterns of thinking, feeling and perceiving\". \n\nIn 1964, Harvard alumnus and social scientist Daniel Yankelovich wrote that traditional demographic traits—sex, age and education level—lacked the insights marketers needed to inform their strategies. He suggested to use of non-demographic segmentation to help companies better predict consumer behavior, to improve product development, distribution, pricing and advertising. Around the same time, market researcher Emanuel Demby began using the term ‘psychographics,’ to reference variations in attitudes, values and behaviors within a specific demographic segment.\n\nWithin a decade, Arnold Mitchell and others at the Stanford Research Institute developed the Values Attitudes and Lifestyles (VALS) psychographic methodology. Despite critics—including Daniel Yankelovich— it was embraced by leading marketers, prompting Advertising Age to call VALS \"one of the ten top market research breakthroughs of the 1980s.\"\n\nAdvances in computing power and the era of big data has fueled the use of all types of segmentation. By applying analytics to break down the marketplace of consumers into smaller groups, marketers and advertisers can profile and target key audiences more effectively. Each type of segmentation offers pros and cons.\n\n\nUltimately, the argument for any type of segmentation is to identify high-yield target markets that are likely to meet growth potential, profitability, or other specific goals.\n\nThe traditional way to develop a psychographic segmentation model has been through a market research study surveying a statistically representative sample of a target audience. That target audience could be representative of the general population, a specific demographic or socioeconomic group, a population of consumers who utilize a certain product or service category or any group of people relevant to one’s research or business objectives.\n\nThe first step is the development of a robust questionnaire consisting of a series of attitudinal statements, often using a Likert scale (e.g., Strongly Agree = 1, Agree = 2, Neither Agree Nor Disagree = 3, Disagree = 4, Strongly Disagree = 5), to assess consumer beliefs about a given subject. Consideration should be given to dimensions that will differentiate consumers in the market, such as attitudes and beliefs about a certain topic or behaviors in a specific situation. \n\nA factor analysis using statistical clustering procedures is conducted to examine response patterns to the survey questions. Natural clusters or segments emerge from groups of respondents who answer the survey questions in a similar manner. A useful illustration is a scatter plot with all of the respondents' answers that shows clusters of respondents who answered the survey questions similarly. Taking all the survey questions into account, consistent groups — or psychographic segments — are identified.\n\nStatistical analysis of the respondents' answers can also identify an algorithm that uses a subset of the survey questions to classify consumers according to the psychographic segments. This could involve five, ten, fifteen or other limited set of questions that effectively categorize consumers by segment. \n\nIn addition to using surveys to gather psychographic data, experts suggest that social media monitoring and analytics can also help marketers identify trends in consumer interests, attitudes, sentiments, and psychographic clusters.\n\nAfter using quantitative marketing research to identify psychographic segments, many marketers and researchers will follow up with qualitative research (e.g., focus groups and one-on-one interviews) with members of each psychographic segment. This allows for additional insights and translation of the quantitative data from the perspective of each segment. This is a useful step for helping to prevent bias in the researcher’s interpretation of the data, as researchers may view data through the lens of their own attitudes and motivations.\n\nThe optimal psychographic segmentation model should meet several criteria:\n\n\nA psychographic segmentation model should be able to accurately predict the segment to which a consumer belongs with an acceptable level of confidence. Often there are trade-offs involved. For instance, a model may attain a higher level of predictability with a greater number of segments, but too many segments become unwieldy and infeasible to juggle when operationalizing the model. This also pertains to the number of questions used in the algorithm to classify consumers by segment. More questions may be more predictive, but there are diminishing returns past a certain number of questions, and too many questions decrease completion rates among consumers.\n\nConsumers recognize that modern marketers and advertisers collect a wealth of data about prospects and customers. As a result, consumers hold brands to a higher standard. Individual consumers expect greater relevance and personalized brand experiences in exchange for the information they share. These expectations, in turn, have increased the need for psychographic segmentation. \n\nMarketers of educational/entertainment technology for the family (e.g., e-readers and video game systems), for example, can identify key audiences based on family income, ages of children in the household, or other demographic indicators. However, these factors do not identify the \"why\" behind purchases. Using psychographic segmentation, marketers can drill down to types of purchasers: \n\n\nUnderstanding these psychographic variations among likely consumers allows marketers to fine-tune keyword targeting to appeal to these distinct sub-groups. \n\nSimilarly, a retail drugstore chain uses a combination of segmentation to identify a super-user who is motivated by a sense of responsibility for family. Marketing strategies are therefore focused on a customer persona of a woman in her early 50s who manages medications for her children, herself and her spouse, and her aging parents.\n\nBusiness travelers have different needs and expectations than vacationers. However, marketing to such broad categories alone fails to capture motivations and personal preferences. Within the broad segment of Leisure Travelers, for example, travel brands can use psychographic segmentation to drill down to identify individuals as 'novelty-seeking' versus 'familiarity-seeking' consumers, and then customize campaigns based on the most relevant travel style.\n\nKnowing that a consumer is 'familiarity-seeking', for example, could lead a travel brand to market guided tour travel packages to that consumer; a 'novelty-seeking' consumer could be targeted with a build-your-own tour package. \n\nThe healthcare industry faces an ongoing mandate to engage patients more effectively to address chronic disease and engage in healthier behaviors. However, experts note that segmentation based on demographic or socioeconomic factors falls short on motivating engagement. Similarly, one-size-fits-all programs based on a shared diagnosis do not lead to high adoption rates of recommended behaviors.\n\nPsychographic segmentation applied to healthcare consumers can help healthcare organizations, health insurance providers, healthcare-related retailers and others classify individual consumers according to whether they:\n\n\nSegmenting healthcare consumers by these factors allows one to customize messaging (whether verbal, print or digital) to appeal to individual motivations to improve overall engagement, drive behavior changes, boost adherence to care plans or increase adoption of medical devices and apps.\n\nThe use of psychographic segmentation and insights have been demonstrated in a clinical setting to improve outcomes, from helping patients with diabetes achieve personal health goals to reducing hospital readmissions following surgery.\n"}

The REDCap End-User License Agreement also encompasses control by Vanderbilt over its licensees' publications on or about REDCap, specifying that Vanderbilt shall coordinate and have editorial control over any \"publications created by CONSORTIUM MEMBERS which discuss the SOFTWARE and its methodologies, functionality, and/or abilities.\" Publications that describe scientific studies which have utilized REDCap are excepted from these editorial restrictions.\n\nThe REDCap software is distributed from Vanderbilt to institutional consortium partners, who in turn give research teams access to REDCap. REDCap project design has an intended workflow outlined by the developers. Upon request, the informatics core gives the research team a demonstration of REDCap, highlighting the most relevant user interface features. The researchers then fill out a Microsoft Excel spreadsheet file with key metadata (i.e. field name, data-type, data range, etc.) about each measurement in their CRF. The informatics core converts this spreadsheet template into study-specific database tables which are linked to a working web-based EDC forms and applications environment. The researchers then test this prototype web application by filling out dummy data, and the metadata spreadsheet is revised and refined in an iterative process. Once the REDCap project design is finalized, the application is deployed from development to production mode, all dummy data is lost, and researchers begin committing actual patient data.\n\nThe REDCap design workflow has important limitations. When a project is deployed into production mode, further revisions in database design need to be approved by the informatics core. Furthermore, certain production mode revisions are simply not allowed. For instance, when applying the REDCap calendar tool, production mode revisions to calendar metadata is prohibited, so researchers are advised to be very careful in formulating metadata and event-handlers before committing to the inflexibility of production mode.\n\n"}

It is found where enamel rods, the functional unit of enamel, meet interrod enamel. The crystals of both types of enamel meet at sharp angles and form the appearance of a space called the rod sheath. As a result of this space, the rod sheath consists of more protein (as opposed to minerals) than other areas of enamel. For this reason, the rod sheath is characterized as being hypomineralized in comparison to the rest of the highly mineralized enamel.\n\nAdditionally, the rod sheath is attributed with giving tooth enamel a \"fish-scale\" appearance under a microscope when the enamel has been demineralized or acid-etched.\n\nThe rod sheath is Inorganic matrix tying the enamel rods together\n\n"}

A similar term which is applied differently is \"autophagy\", which specifically denotes the normal process of self-degradation by cells. While almost an exclusive term for this process, autophagy nonetheless has occasionally made its way into more common usage.\n\nA certain amount of self-cannibalism occurs unwittingly, as the body consumes dead cells from the tongue and cheeks.\nIngesting one's own blood from an unintentional lesion such as a nose-bleed or an ulcer is clearly not intentional harvesting and consequently not considered cannibalistic. Ingesting one’s own blood on purpose from a deliberate wound is, however.\n\nFingernail-biting that develops into fingernail-eating is a form of pica, although many do not consider nail biting as a true form of cannibalism. Other forms of pica include the compulsion of eating one's own hair, which can form a hairball in the stomach. Left untreated, this can cause death due to excessive hair buildup.\n\nSome people will engage in self-cannibalism as an extreme form of body modification, for example eating their own skin. Others will drink their own blood, a practice called autovampirism, but sucking blood from wounds is generally not considered cannibalism. Placentophagy may be a form of self-cannibalism.\n\nForced self-cannibalism as a form of torture or war crime has been reported. Erzsébet Báthory allegedly forced some of her servants to eat their own flesh in the early 17th century. Incidents were reported in the years following the 1991 Haitian coup d'état. In the 1990s, young people in Sudan were forced to eat their own ears.\n\nThe short-tailed cricket is known to eat its own wings. There is evidence of certain animals digesting their own nervous tissue when they transition to a new phase of life. The sea squirt (with a tadpole-like shape) contains a ganglion \"brain\" in its head, which it digests after attaching itself to a rock and becoming stationary, forming an anemone-like organism. This has been used as evidence that the purpose of brain and nervous tissue is primarily to produce movement. Self-cannibalism behavior has been documented in North American rat snakes: one captive snake attempted to consume itself twice, dying in the second attempt. Another wild rat snake was found having swallowed about two-thirds of its body.\n\n\n"}

She surprised her family by moving to Switzerland to study medicine in 1883. In 1892, she was hired by the authorities of Austria-Hungary to work as a public health official in Bosnia and Herzegovina. One of the first women to practice medicine in Bosnia and Herzegovina and Austria-Hungary, Krajewska mainly treated Bosnian Muslim women, whom she regarded as susceptible to particular health problems. Krajewska wrote detailed notes about the state of women and Muslim customs. These writings, published in 1989, reveal the patronizing attitude towards Muslims that was common for the era. Krajewska stayed in Bosnia after the collapse of Austria-Hungary but the loss of eyesight forced her to retire in 1922. In 1928, she moved back to Warsaw, a decision she regretted, where she died.\n\nTeodora Kosmowska was born to an intelligentsia family in Warsaw, then part of Russian Poland. Her father, Ignacy, worked in a school, while her mother, Seweryna (née Główczyńska), brought up the couple's eight daughters. The family were friends with the Skłodowskis, whose daughter Maria played with the Kosmowski daughters. After graduating from Warsaw's prestigious girls' gymnasium, Teodora Kosmowska passed teacher's exam and started teaching arithmetic to gymnasium students. She quit her job in 1876, when she married Ignacy Krajewski, a professor of classical philology. The couple entertained various members of the intelligentsia at their home, including the writer Aleksander Świętochowski and the Skłodowskis. These contacts influenced Krajewska to start writing novels, poems, and literature reviews, as well as to translate.\n\nThe turning point in Krajewska's life was the death of her husband in 1881. She at first resumed her teaching career, working in a private gymnasium run by her aunts, Leokadia and Bronislawa Kosmowska, and continued writing novels. Young Polish widows at the time were expected to remarry, but Krajewska defied both the social norm and her parents' wishes. She left Warsaw in 1883, travelled to Switzerland and enrolled in the University of Geneva. Krajewska first studied physiology, becoming the first female teaching assistant in the university's history, and then took up medicine. She was actively involved in the activities of the Polish diaspora in Switzerland, serving as the President of the Association of Polish Students.\n\nKrajewska passed her final exams in 1891 and received an award for her doctoral dissertation the following year, but found that she could not obtain the nostrification of her diploma or practice medicine in her homeland. It thus did not take her much thought to respond to the notice of the Austro-Hungarian authorities, who were looking for female physicians to work in the newly occupied Bosnia and Herzegovina.\n\nTeodora Krajewska was named the public health official (\"Amtärztin\") of the District of Tuzla with the rank of captain by the decree of 28 November 1892. In order to perform obstetric and gynecological procedures, she undertook training in a clinic in Vienna. Women could not study or practice medicine in Austria-Hungary at the time, but exceptions had to be made for Bosnia and Herzegovina, where Muslim women refused to be treated by male physicians. Krajewska was thus not only one of the first female physicians in Bosnia and Herzegovina but in Austria-Hungary as well. Seven women in total were employed to treat Bosnian women; Krajewska was one of the three Russian citizens and one of the two ethnic Poles. Before assuming her office, Krajewska had to take Austro-Hungarian citizenship. She succeeded Anna Bayerová, a Czech, who had resigned shortly after her appointment due to frequent disagreements with her military superiors. Bayerová was unwilling to care predominantly for Bosnian Muslim women, as her superiors had expected, while Krajewska embraced the task.\n\nKrajewska's arrival in Tuzla in March 1893 was announced by the town crier. She was dismayed to find \"these marvellous Slavic women covered by veils\". Krajewska learned Serbo-Croatian quickly. She usually rode a Bosnian pony on her visits to remote mountain villages but had to travel by foot when the winters were too severe for the horse. The demand for Krajewska's services was such that the Austro-Hungarian authorities soon employed Bohuslava Kecková, another Pole, who took up post in Mostar. Speaking at the 1896 International Congress of Women in Berlin, Krajewska defended colonialism by arguing that Bosnians and Herzegovinians needed \"civilization and progress from the outside\", imposed \"from above\". The imperial feminism espoused by Krajewska was rejected by Austrian women's movements, which had a liberal outlook.\n\nKrajewska was particularly interested in osteomalacia. She published a detailed article about it in 1900, claiming, on the basis of only 50 cases, that the disorder was endemic among Muslim women living in the mountains of Tuzla District. According to Krajewska, Christian women were never afflicted. She blamed \"damp climate\", \"lack of sun\", poverty, malnutrition, and \"Muslim customs\" (chiefly child marriage, seclusion, veiling, excessive libido of Muslim men, overly frequent pregnancies, and prolonged breastfeeding) for the supposedly endemic osteomalacia.\n\nIn 1901, Krajewska was moved to Sarajevo, with Jadwiga Olszewska replacing her in Tuzla. As the public health official of the District of Sarajevo, she regularly traveled to the towns of Foča, Fojnica, Goražde, Vareš, and Visoko. In addition to practicing medicine, Krajewska taught hygiene in several Sarajevo schools. While doing so, she met another teacher and writer, Jagoda Truhelka, with whom she developed a close friendship. She also formed friendships with native Bosnians, favoring Croats but also including \"progressive Muslims\"; she disliked Serbs due to their perceived Russophilia. The backbone of her contacts, however, was formed by foreigners who had, like herself, flocked to Bosnia and Herzegovina during the Austro-Hungarian rule.\n\nThe First World War, triggered by the assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand several hundred meters away from Krajewska's home in Sarajevo in 1914, ended the Austro-Hungarian rule in Bosnia and Herzegovina. While the majority of the upper class Poles in Bosnia and Herzegovina moved to the newly established Second Polish Republic, Krajewska stayed. Her eyesight deteriorated during the war due to cataracts; a surgical intervention in Prague was unsuccessful. By 1922, she had to retire.\n\nAfter years of living alone with her cat, Krajewska decided to leave \"the country and the people she knew and loved\". She returned to Warsaw, now capital of Poland, in 1927. She found that the city had changed immensely and she did not feel at home there anymore. She had been one of the best known and most respected people in Sarajevo, but only an anonymous old woman in Warsaw. With her sisters and their children living in southern Poland and her friends in Bosnia, Krajewska felt lonely and bitter. Already frail and almost completely blind, she undertook a strenuous journey to see Bosnia for the last time before dying in Warsaw on 5 September 1935.\n\nKrajewska left behind numerous reports and a detailed diary. In her old age, Krajewska entrusted these writings to her friend Zofia Grabowska. Krajewska's nephew, Zbigniew Danielak, edited her diary and had it published in Poland in 1989. The original manuscript is kept in the Ossolineum. Parts of it were translated into Serbo-Croatian by the Bosnian writer Marina Trumić, who died before she could finish.\n\nKrajewska's detailed reports of her impressions of Muslim customs reflect the Orientalist stereotypes common in the era. She insisted that the Muslims of Bosnia and Herzegovina were less intelligent and less civilized than their Christian compatriots. Judging various nations and ethnicities by the progressiveness of their respective national movements, Krajewska classified Serbs as \"extraordinarily intelligent\", Croats as \"average\", and Bosnian Muslims as a \"superfluous and foreign element\". Reports of her colleagues in Bosnia and Herzegovina, including Bohuslava Kecková, contradicted Krajewska's writings and denied the correlation between religious affiliation and intelligence.\n\n"}

Its etymology is from Greek θηλή [tʰelḗ], “nipple” and ἀρχή [arkʰḗ], “beginning, onset”. Thelarche is usually noticed as a firm, tender lump directly under the centre of the nipple (papilla and areola). Thelarche is also referred to as a \"breast bud\", or more formally as Tanner stage 2 breast development (Tanner stage 1 being the entirely undeveloped prepubertal state). Thelarche may occur on one side first, or both sides simultaneously.\n\nThelarche is the first physical change of puberty in about 60 percent of girls, usually after 8 years of age. It is a result of rising levels of estradiol. It is typical for a woman's breasts to be unequal in size, particularly while the breasts are developing. Statistically it is slightly more common for the left breast to be the larger. In rare cases, the breasts may be significantly different in size, or one breast may fail to develop entirely.\n\nAlthough breast development can occur as a part of normal male puberty, it is termed gynecomastia, and the term \"thelarche\" is not used with reference to male breast development.\n\nWhen thelarche occurs at an unusually early age, it may be the first manifestation of precocious puberty. If no other changes of puberty or sex hormone effects occur, it is referred to as isolated premature thelarche, and generally requires no treatment.\n\n\n"}

It is intended to handle critical fatality management functions made necessary by a major disaster.\n\nIn the event of a mass casualty event, it will initially be used by New York City's 311 call center operators, the New York Police Department, and OCME to gather key information to facilitate compiling an accurate list of missing persons. UVIS will also be used by the OCME to track decedents and collect postmortem findings to facilitate the identification process after a disaster. UVIS also contains a Pandemic Flu module to prepare against such an eventuality.\n\nUVIS was built for the OCME by Trumbull, Connecticut-based consulting firm ICRA Sapphire Inc.\n\nDeveloped with public funds, UVIS is available to municipalities, counties, states, and other governmental agencies without charge, under license from New York City.\n\nThe Ante-Mortem Section relates to activities carried out before an individual is absolutely known to be deceased. These include recording key information about the missing individual and managing interactions with the missing person's family members.\n\nMass casualty events generate numerous calls to government agencies: for example, the 2005 London subway bombing generated some 42,000 calls to the UK. Casualty Bureau call centers within the Bureau's first hour of operation. The Call Center module can handle tens of thousands of calls from individuals reporting or enquiring about missing persons, and record basic information about both the missing person and the caller.\n\nThe Missing Persons module enables NYPD Missing Persons detectives to conduct detailed interviews of family members, friends, and acquaintances of missing persons, and can store extremely detailed data ranging from clothing to physical characteristics such as eye and hair color to tattoo or scar information.\n\nThe UVIS Family Assistance Center module manages Family Assistance Centers (FACs), which are established to provide services to, and capture information from, the family and friends of injured, missing, or deceased disaster victims. Services generally provided at a FAC include: grief counseling; childcare; religious support; facilitation of family needs such as hotel, food, and transportation; ante-mortem data collection by the investigative authorities and the medical examiner or coroner; and notification of death to the next of kin. The UVIS Family Assistance Center module tracks all interactions and appointments with the family of missing persons, and can manage the personal items of victims received from family members for identification purposes.\n\nThe Records modules handles requests for records from family members, lawyers, and public administrators, providing “Chain of Custody” for all records.\n\nThe Post-Mortem Section deals with human remains recovered from mass casualty sites.\n\nThe Field Operations module can help users to manage incidents, field investigation, and the collection of remains and evidence, as well as maintaining records and documentation about remains and evidence. Because internet connectivity will often be unavailable at disaster sites, the Field Operations module has a Microsoft Windows-based client version that can capture data off-line and synchronize with the main database when connectivity is available.\n\nThe Disaster Mortuary Management module provides mortuary management functionality. It supports the accessioning of remains, both check-in and check-out; the examination of remains by Medical Examiner and Anthropology; the tracking and documentation of autopsies and individual remains; and the final disposition of remains to funeral homes.\n\nThis module has bidirectional (from ante- to post-mortem and back) one-to-many search capabilities based on multiple criteria. It possesses considerable identification tracking capabilities including DNA, fingerprint, radiology, and dental (see UDIM below). The module enables identification review and verification, including DNA re-sampling. It also enables the consolidation of fragmented remains as they are uncovered.\n\nThe Disaster Victim Identification module can conduct notification tracking, including communication both with family members and media about a given decedent. It is capable of issuing death certification either when remains are found or not. It also maintains a log of all family communications, and can schedule and track family visits.\n\nA Forensic Odontology add-on, UDIM possesses detailed charting, complex and advanced search, and the ability to look for anomalies.\n\nPandemic influenza remains a serious threat. The U.S. Health and Human Services Department forecasts that if a lethal flu pandemic strikes, deaths could range from 209,000 to 1.9 million.\n\nIf an influenza pandemic occurs, the magnitude of the event would demand a response from the NYC OCME to assist any governmental health care facilities as well as to support facilities in the private sector. Health care facilities which would be affected by a flu pandemic include public and private hospitals, nursing homes, retirement facilities, prison health clinics, public health clinics, and mental health hospitals. During a flu pandemic causing mass fatalities, the limited morgues and decedent storage space at most health care facilities will be quickly overwhelmed. The proposed solution consists of temporary morgues, known as Body Collection Points (BCPs), at health care facilities. These would be either refrigerated 18-wheel trailers or refrigerated CONEX containers.\n\nThe UVIS Pandemic Flu module enables health care facility morgue managers to administer BCPs, allowing them to: \nThe Pandemic Flu module also enables medical examiner personnel to handle health care facilities’ requests for BCPs, managing the location and distribution of storage units at health care facilities, police precincts, or any other designated location. If necessary, they can place a request on behalf of a facility. \nAs well, Pandemic Flu module enables medical examiner personnel to create reports for decedents and to search for decedents using the specimen number, last name, first name, and/or date of death. They can also track and record the progress of a decedent’s case. Currently, the system tracks remains that are awaiting investigation, awaiting disposition, and transportation. UVIS tracks time elapsed in each state and color-codes each record, giving an immediate visual indication of the status of each case.\n\nNYC OCME personnel can also search the New York State Electronic Death Record System (EDRS) for decedents.\n\nAs part of UVIS, the Pandemic Influenza module’s data is available for search within the system.\n\nThe Administrative Section allows users to create incidents, to which missing persons are attached; conduct records management; and carry out other system administration tasks.\n\nUVIS is a multi-tiered, browser- and Windows-based application, written in Microsoft-based technology, and running on a minimum configuration of Microsoft Windows Server 2003 and Microsoft SQL 2000 / 2005 as the database engine.\n\n"}
