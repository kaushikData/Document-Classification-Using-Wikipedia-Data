While the sector's contribution to its national gross domestic product has significantly declined in the last 50 years, it currently remains an income generator for the majority of Indonesian households. In 2013, the agricultural sector contributed 14.43% to national GDP, a slight decline from 2003's contribution which was 15.19%. In 2012, the agricultural sector provides jobs to approximately 49 million Indonesians, representing 41% of the country's total labor force.\n\nCurrently, approximately 30% of Indonesia's land area is used for agriculture. Indonesian agriculture sector is supervised and regulated by the Indonesian Ministry of Agriculture.\n\nThe agricultural sector of Indonesia consists of:\n\n\nThe large plantations focus on export commodities such as palm oil and rubber, while the small scale farmers focus on horticultural commodities such as rice, soybeans, corn, fruits and vegetables in order to meet the food consumption of the local and regional population, .\n\nLocated in the tropical region, Indonesia enjoys abundant rain and sunshine most of the time, which are important elements for agricultural products to thrive. The country possesses vast and abundant arable fertile soils. Indonesia is the world's major producer of a wide variety of agricultural tropical products and important agricultural commodities which include palm oil, natural rubber, cocoa, coffee, tea, cassava, rice and tropical spices.\n\nAt present, Indonesia is also the world's largest producer of palm oil, cloves, and cinnamon, the 2nd largest producer of nutmeg natural rubber cassava vanilla and coconut oil, the 3rd largest producer of rice and cocoa, the 4th largest producer of coffee. the 5th largest tobacco producer. and the 6th largest producer of tea.\n\nIn Indonesian history, agricultural pursuits spanned for some millennia with some traces still observable in some parts of the archipelago. The hunter-gatherer society still exist in interior Kalimantan (Indonesian Borneo) and Papua (Indonesian New Guinea) such as the Kombai people, while they were a sophisticated rice-cultivating community, the remnants of Hindu-Buddhist polity can still be observed in Bali through their subak irrigation system. \n\nAgriculture in Indonesia started as a means to grow and provide food. Rice, coconut, sugar palm, taro, tubers, shallots and tropical fruits were among the earliest produce being cultivated in the archipelago. Evidence of wild rice cultivation on the island of Sulawesi dates back from 3000 BCE. Rice has been a staple food for Indonesians for a millennia and holds a central place in Indonesian culture and cuisine. \n\nThe importance of rice in Indonesian culture is demonstrated through the reverence of Dewi Sri, the rice goddess of ancient Java and Bali. Traditionally, the agricultural cycles linked to rice cultivation were celebrated through rituals, such as Sundanese \"Seren Taun\" or the \"rice harvest festival.\" In Bali, the traditional subak irrigation system was created to ensure that there is adequate water supply for rice paddies. The irrigation system was managed by priests and created around \"water temples\". Indonesian vernacular architecture also recognizes numbers of \"lumbung\" or rice barns styles, such as Sundanese \"leuit\", Sasak style rice barn, Toraja's \"tongkonan\" shape, to Minangkabau's \"rangkiang\". Rice-growing shapes the landscape, is sold at markets, and is served in most meals.\n\nWhile some panels of the bas-reliefs on temple walls, such as Borobudur and Prambanan, describe agricultural activities, Javanese stone inscriptions which can be traced back from the 8th century, describes the king placing a levy on rice. Next to rice, the bas-reliefs of Borobudur describe other indigenous agricultural products as well, like banana (\"musa paradisiaca\"), coconut (\"Cocos nucifera\"), sugarcane (\"Saccharum officinarum'), Java apple (\"Syzygium samarangense\"), jackfruit (\"Artocarpus heterophyllus\"), durian (\"Durio zibethinus\") and mangosteen (\"Mangifera indica\").\"\nLocal kingdoms in Indonesia were among the earliest polities to participate in global spice trade. The ancient maritime empires of Srivijaya (7th to 11th century) and Majapahit (13th to 15th century) for example, were actively involved in spice trade with China, India and the Middle East. Ports of Sunda and Banten were important centers of pepper trade back in the 14th to 17th centuries.\n\nCertain endemic Indonesian spices such as nutmeg which is indigenous to the Banda Islands and cloves were highly sought in the West, and prompted the European Age of Exploration. The Portuguese were the earliest Europeans who established their presence in the archipelago by the early 16th century. The Portuguese, through Spanish intermediaries, introduced the New World's products such as chili pepper, maize, papaya, peanuts, potato, tomato, rubber and tobacco into the archipelago's soil.\n\nThe surge of the global spice trade was what led European traders reach the Indonesian archipelago who were in search for direct sources of valuable spices, at the same time, cut through middlemen in Asia (Arabs and Indian merchants) and in Europe (Italian merchants). By the early 17th century, Dutch East India Company (VOC) began to establish its influence within the archipelago, by building trading offices, warehouses and forts in Amboina and Batavia. By then, VOC monopolized the spice commodity trade, especially pepper and nutmeg, and actively pursued its shares in intra-Asian trades with India and China. VOC further established sugar plantations in Java.\n\nBy the turn of the 19th century, VOC was declared bankrupt and was nationalized by the Dutch as Dutch East Indies. This event officially marked the Dutch colonial period in the archipelago. In the mid-19th century, the Dutch East Indies government implemented \"cultuurstelsel\" which required a portion of agricultural production lands to be devoted to export crops. The cultivation system was enforced in Java and other parts of Indonesia by the Dutch colonial government between 1830 and 1870. Indonesian historians refer to it as \"Tanam Paksa\" (\"Enforcement Planting\"). The Dutch introduced numbers of cash crops and commodities to create and establish an economic engine in its colony. Establishment of sugarcane, coffee, tea, tobacco, quinine, rubber and palm oil plantations was also expanded in the colony. \n\nDuring the Dutch East Indies era, the agriculture sector was regulated by the \"Departement van Landbouw\" (1905), \"Departement van Landbouw, Nijverheid en Handel\" (1911) and \"Departement van Ekonomische Zaken\" (1934).\n\nIn 1942, Dutch East Indies fell under the control of the Japanese Empire. During the Japanese occupation, the agriculture sector was overseen by the \"Gunseikanbu Sangyobu\". During World War II (1942—1945), the Indies experienced hardships which included agricultural scarcity and famine. Rice yields and plantation commodities were controlled by the Japanese empire's military authority. The plantation business which was a major economic sector, was relatively shut down during the Pacific War and the ensuing Indonesian war of independence (1945—1949). All efforts in the agricultural sector was focused in meeting basic needs for food (rice) and clothing (cotton). The Imperial Japanese authority attempted to increase rice and cotton production in the occupied Indies by mobilizing labor. However, scarcity of these essential commodities prevailed and resulted to famine and clothing shortage.\n\nThe Indonesian Republic declared its independence on 17 August 1945. Indonesia became a member of United Nation's Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) in 1948. The partnership was strengthened with the opening of a FAO country office in 1978. The agriculture sector of the republic has been supervised and regulated by the Indonesian Ministry of Agriculture. The Indonesian Republic also nationalized many of its colonial economic infrastructures, institutions and businesses and inherited the agricultural system of its predecessor, the Dutch East Indies. \n\nIn the 1960s until the 1980s, the republic made every effort to develop a post-war agricultural sector and led to the sector's significant expansion. During the Suharto era, the government launched the transmigration program that relocated landless farmers from the overpopulated Java to the less populated Sumatra, Kalimantan, Sulawesi and Papua, thus expanded agricultural farms in the outer islands of the territory.\n\nThe most significant indicator of growth is the expansion of palm oil plantations, which became the new form of transmigration program. Currently, Indonesia is the world's largest producer of palm oil and the leading producer of coffee, rubber and cocoa. However, Indonesia still has vast tracts of idle lands which can potentially be developed into farmlands. These cover 40 million hectares of degraded forest areas that have turned into grasslands after being abandoned by logging concessionaires. \n\nAgricultural commodities are known for its economic resilience and are among the first to recover from the impacts of global financial meltdown. With a large number of its population still working in the agriculture segment, Indonesia has great potentials of attracting foreign investments.\n\nThe agriculture sector plays a vital role in food production and food security and in supplying the needs of a huge Indonesian population.\n\nRice is a staple food in the Indonesian diet, as typical Indonesian meal consists of richly flavored side dishes, meat or poultry and vegetables, surrounding a pile of steamed rice. Indonesia is the 3rd largest rice producer in the world after China and India. However, because of Indonesia's large population, the rice it produces is consumed internally. To ensure food security, the government fills the gap by importing from neighboring countries like Thailand, Vietnam and Cambodia.\n\nHorticulture, which covers fruits and vegetables production, holds an important role in the local Indonesian economy and in the attainment of food security. Indonesia possesses a variety of horticultural products. Its native fruits include durian, mangosteen, rambutan, salak, banana, jackfruit, mango, \"kedondong\", \"jambu air\", \"buni\", \"jamblang\" and \"kecapi\". The bulk of fruits and vegetables needed by consumers are supplied by local traditional farmers. The products prices are highly dependent on seasonal availability and proximity to production centers, due to transportation and cargo infrastructure restrictions. As a result, prices of horticulture products vary greatly throughout Indonesia. Prices might be cheaper in Bandung and Bukittinggi as they are closer to horticulture farms but are significantly more expensive in Pekanbaru and Balikpapan which are located far from production centers. Recently, owing to a varied Indonesian topography, non-tropical horticultural products such as apple, strawberry, honeydew, grapes and dragon fruit are grown in the cooler mountainous region of Indonesia. The mountainous region around Malang in East Java is the production center for apple and dragon fruit, while those around Bandung in West Java are the production centers for strawberry, honeydew and mushroom.\n\nDespite its being home to the world's 4th largest population making it a huge market for horticultural products, the horticultural sector in Indonesia is deemed as under-performing which leads to the necessity of importing fruits and vegetables. Indonesian horticulture farmers face a problematic situation - the imported horticultural products are often cheaper than the locally produced horticultural products. Compared to neighboring countries with a well-developed horticultural sector like Thailand, Indonesia has much to improve. Currently, Indonesia imports much of its horticultural needs from Thailand (durian, carrot and chili pepper), China (garlic, orange and pear) and from the United States (soybean and apple). To protect local farmers, the Indonesian government applied protectionist policies on import settings\nfor horticultural products, as well as restricting ports of entry.\n\nSpice is an essential element in Indonesian cuisine. In Indonesian, spice is called \"rempah\", while the mixture of spices is called \"bumbu\", they are chopped finely or ground into paste using traditional stone mortar and pestle, and spread over vegetables, meat, poultry, fish and seafood to add aroma and taste. Known throughout the world as the \"Spice Islands\", the Indonesian islands of Maluku contributed to the introduction of its native spices to the world. Spices such as \"pala\" (nutmeg/mace), \"cengkeh\" (clove), \"daun\" \"pandan\" (Pandan leaves), \"kluwek\" (Pangium edule) and \"laos\" (galangal) are native to Indonesia. However, surprisingly nutmeg, mace and cloves are seldomly used in Indonesian cuisine.\n\nIt is likely that \"lada hitam\" (black pepper), \"kunyit\" (turmeric), \"sereh\" (lemongrass), \"salam koja\" (curry leaf), \"bawang merah\" (shallot), \"kayu manis\" (cinnamon), \"kemiri\" (candlenut), \"ketumbar\" (coriander), and \"asam jawa\" (tamarind) were introduced from India or mainland Southeast Asia, while \"jahe\" (ginger), \"daun bawang\" (scallions) and \"bawang putih\" (garlic) were introduced from China. Those spices from mainland Asia were introduced early, in ancient times, thus they became integral ingredients in Indonesian cuisine. While the New World spices such as chili pepper and tomato were introduced by Portuguese and Spanish traders during the age of exploration in the 16th century.\n\nIndonesia is both the world's biggest producer and consumer of the commodity, providing about half the world supply. Oil palm plantations stretch across 6 million hectares. Palm oil is the essential ingredients to produces cooking oil, as well as other food and cosmetics products. The country also aimed to be the largest palm-based biofuel production center.\n\nCoconut plays an important role in Indonesian cuisine as well as its economy. Coconut milk is an important common ingredients in numbers of Indonesian favourites, including \"rendang\" and \"soto\". According to figures published in December 2009 by the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations, it is the world's second largest producer of coconuts, producing 15,319,500 tonnes in 2009.\n\nIndonesian rubber industry take its root in colonial Dutch East Indies; in the early 20th century the rubber plantation in the colony was booming, largely owed to the advent of natural rubber tire industry to supply the growing automotive industry in the United States and Europe. Currently, Indonesia's rubber production is the world's second-largest after Thailand. Natural rubber is an important export commodity that earn foreign exchange, with increasing production trend. In fact, ASEAN nations are among the largest natural rubber producers; the combined rubber yield of three ASEAN members — Thailand, Indonesia and Malaysia — accounts for nearly 66 percent of global total rubber production. However, compared to neighbouring countries, Indonesia's productivity level is lower (1,080 kg/ha), compared to Thailand (1,800 kg/ha), Vietnam (1,720 kg/ha) and Malaysia (1,510 kg/ha). Smallholder farmers in Indonesia retain for about 85 percent of total rubber estates, which suggests the minor role of government and large private estates in Indonesian rubber industry. Another problem is the lack of rubber processing facilities and manufacturing industry. In Indonesia, about half of the natural rubber that is absorbed internally goes to the tire manufacturing industry, followed by rubber gloves, rubber thread, footwear, retread tires, medical gloves, rubber carpets and various rubber tools.\n\nIn 2014, Indonesia was the fourth largest producer of coffee. Coffee in Indonesia began with its colonial history, and has played an important part in the growth of the country. Indonesia's geographic location is considered as ideal for coffee plantations. It is located near the equator and with numerous mountainous regions across the islands which creates suitable micro-climates for the growth and production of coffee.\n\nIndonesia produced an estimated 540,000 metric tons of coffee in 2014. Of this total, estimated 154,800 tons was required for domestic consumption in the 2013–2014 financial year. Of the exports, 25% are arabica beans; the balance is robusta.\n\nIndonesia is the world sixth largest tea producer. Tea production in Indonesia began in the 18th century, introduced by the Dutch as cash crop. Indonesia produced 150,100 tonnes of tea in 2013. However, 65% of that was exported from the country, which suggests Indonesians relatively low tea consumption. Tea production in Indonesian focused mainly on black tea, although small amounts of green are also produced. Moreover, many Indonesian tea varieties are not well known globally, since much of the Indonesian tea is used in blends; mixed with other teas.\n\nIndonesia is the fifth largest tobacco producer in the world, and also the fifth largest tobacco market in the world, and in 2008 over 165 billion cigarettes were sold in the country.\n\nAs agricultural pursuits altered the natural landscapes; from rainforest, peat lands and swamps into arable lands, certainly it poses natural and environmental consequences. Environmental problems such as deforestation and forest and plantation fires, caused by forestry and agricultural sectors in Indonesia, continues to be a persisting problem that need to be addressed and solved.\n\nThe deforestation in Indonesia is caused by logging industry, either legal or illegal, and in turn also contributed by the conversion of natural rainforest into agricultural lands, especially palm oil plantation. Clearing rainforests for oil palm plantations has destroyed critical habitat for endangered species like rhinos, elephants, tigers and orangutans, which have all been pushed to the verge of extinction. This practice has raised international scrutiny on palm oil industry in Indonesia, especially from World Wide Fund for Nature, and raised the demand on sustainable palm oil production and certification.\n\nIndonesian palm oil plantations' poor practice and poor environmental responsibility, has led to massive haze problem annually. Since 1997 Indonesia has been struggling to contain forest fires, especially on the islands of Sumatra and Kalimantan. Haze occurs annually during the dry season and is largely caused by illegal agricultural fires due to slash-and-burn practices in Indonesia, especially in the provinces of South Sumatra and Riau on Indonesia's Sumatra island, and Kalimantan on Indonesian Borneo. The haze that occurred in 1997 was one of the most severe; dense hazes occurred again in 2005, 2006, 2009, 2013, and the worst was in 2015, killing dozens of Indonesians as a result of respiratory illnesses and road accidents due to poor visibility.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "3599792", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=3599792", "title": "Aqua Augusta (Naples)", "text": "Aqua Augusta (Naples)\n\nThe Aqua Augusta, or Serino Aqueduct (), was one of the largest, most complex and costliest aqueduct systems in the Roman world; it supplied water to at least eight ancient cities in the Bay of Naples including Pompeii and Herculaneum. This aqueduct was unlike any other of its time, being a regional network rather than being focussed on one urban centre.\n\nThe route of the aqueduct is well known thanks to the writings of two Italian engineers who were asked to see if it could be brought back in use as the main water supply of Naples in the 16th and 19th centuries.\n\nThere were ten branches, seven of which were for cities while three were for some of the numerous luxurious villas in this area popular with rich Romans, such as the Villa Pollio at Posillipo. Including the branches, the total length of the aqueduct was approximately , making it the longest Roman aqueduct, with the possible exception of the Gadara Aqueduct, until the 5th century AD when the Valens Aqueduct was extended in Constantinople. The Aqua Augusta was one of the most difficult and costly aqueducts ever constructed by an ancient civilisation. Despite its size and complexity, the Augusta is today largely unknown as a major monument because most of it is underground. \n\nThe aqueduct's source, the Fons Augusteus (now known as Acquaro-Pelosi), was in the Terminio-Tuoro mountains near the modern town of Serino not far from the city of Avellino and at 376 metres above sea level. One of its main terminations was the enormous Piscina Mirabilis at the naval base and port of Misenum.\n\nSince the aqueduct traversed such a distance, many difficulties were encountered when building it; two-kilometre-long tunnels were cut through mountains, and there was ground movement near the coast due to volcanoes and a sea crossing was needed to the island of Nisida.\n\nThere is evidence that a large number of private users were members of the Rome senatorial class. In Rome, a letter from the emperor was required to gain a private connection and so it seems that imperial favour was also a factor in accessing the Augusta's water.\nThe Emperor Augustus (or more likely his close friend and ally Agrippa) had the Aqua Augusta built between 30 and 20 BC.\n\nDuring the war with Pompeius, Augustus ordered the construction of the Portus Julius harbour complex just west of Puteoli. Later, this harbour was seen as less ideal for the navy because of silting problems and a new major naval base was built further west at Misenum, where two lakes were connected to become the basis of the western Mediterranean war fleet. Large quantities of fresh water were needed for the base itself and for the ships, which must have been one of the reasons why Augustus had the new aqueduct built. The main cistern filled by the aqueduct is the Piscina Mirabilis in Ba ́coli (Misenum).\n\nSuch a major monument required constant maintenance; there were major repairs in the Flavian period (1st century AD) with the addition of parallel tunnels and the Emperor Constantine also engaged in a massive restoration documented on an inscription tablet discovered in Serino and dated to AD 324. The destinations listed are:\n\nThe cities of Pompeii, Herculaneum and Stabiae were also originally supplied by the aqueduct but being destroyed and covered by the eruption of Vesuvius in 79 AD they did not appear on this list.\n\nThe next major eruption in 472 AD left the aqueduct covered in ash and 3.5 km of the duct collapsed because of this. This cut off the supply of water to all the towns except Nola and Acerrae. The poor administrative and economic situation in Campania at this time, and Italy in general, prevented major repairs to the Augusta. Written references to aqueducts in Naples after this time only refer to other aqueducts that were now in the area.\n\nIn modern times, parts of the aqueduct, in addition to the Piscina Mirabilis were vital to the region's survival during World War II. Many locals used the areas as air-raid shelters.\n\nThere are few visible remains of the aqueduct today, although much of it still exists below ground. Traces of the original structure may be found at a number of sites in and around Naples.\n\nThese include:\n\nIt features prominently in the novel \"Pompeii\" by Robert Harris, whose protagonist is a water engineer (\"Aquarius\") sent from Rome to maintain the aqueduct in AD 79 during the time around the eruption of Mount Vesuvius.\n\n\n\n"}

It was coined in 1995 by Ken Keeler, a writer for the television series \"The Simpsons\", and has entered two Oxford quotation dictionaries.\n\nThe term \"cheese-eating surrender monkeys\" first appeared in 'Round Springfield\", an episode from April 1995 of the American animated television show \"The Simpsons\". In the episode, budget cuts at Springfield Elementary School force the school's Scottish janitor, Groundskeeper Willie, to teach French. Expressing his disdain for the French people, he says to his French class in his Scottish accent: \"Bonjoooouuurrr, ya cheese-eatin' surrender monkeys!\" \n\nOn the episode's audio commentary, executive producer Al Jean said the line was \"probably\" written by \"The Simpsons\" staff writer Ken Keeler. In a February 2012 interview, Keeler confirmed that he coined the term; he said he considers it his best contribution to the show. Al Jean commented that the staff did not expect the term to become widely used and never intended it as any kind of genuine political statement. \n\nWhen \"Round Springfield\" was dubbed in French, the line became \"Rendez-vous, singes mangeurs de fromage\" (\"Surrender, you cheese-eating monkeys\").\n\nUse of the term has grown outside of the United States, particularly in the United Kingdom, where \"The Simpsons\" is popular.\n\nJonah Goldberg, an American \"National Review\" journalist, used it as the title of an April 1999 column called \"Top Ten Reasons to Hate the French\". In the run up to and during the Iraq War, Goldberg reprised it to criticize European nations and France in particular for not joining the United States in its invasion and occupation of Iraq.\n\nBen Macintyre of \"Times of London\" wrote in August 2007, that it is \"perhaps the most famous\" of the coinages from \"The Simpsons\" and it \"has gone on to become a journalistic cliché\". The \"New York Post\" used it (as \"Surrender Monkeys\") as the headline for its December 7, 2006, front page, referring to the Iraq Study Group, and its recommendation that American soldiers be withdrawn from Iraq by January 2008. \n\nArticles in the \"Daily Mail\" (2005 and 2009) used it to describe France's \"attitude problem\" and the \"muted\" European reaction to the death of Osama bin Laden; \"The Daily Telegraph\" (November 2010) cited it in relation to Anglo-French military cooperation. In August 2013, \"The Independent\" suggested an evolution away from the term, in a headline about French-American relations over the Syrian Civil War.\n\nJeremy Clarkson used it on a 4 June 2006 episode of \"Top Gear\", to describe the manufacturers of the Citroën C6. He had previously used it on \"Top Gear\" in June 2003, describing the handling of the Renault Clio V6. Later on in the television show, (Series 13, Episode 5) Clarkson describes the other French drivers as \"cheese-eating sideways monkeys\", referring to the fact that the other drivers were overtaking him whilst sliding sideways.\n\nNed Sherrin selected it for inclusion in the \"Oxford Dictionary of Humorous Quotations\", being introduced in the third edition in 2005.

She was presented on the November 1999 Millennium cover of American \"Vogue\" as one of the \"Modern Muses\". Turlington has appeared on international fashion magazines that include \"Vogue\", \"Harper's Bazaar\", \"Elle\", \"Marie Claire\", \"L'Officiel\", \"Tatler\", \"Glamour\", \"Cosmopolitan\" and \"Allure\".\n\nTurlington has been featured in advertising campaigns for Calvin Klein, Chanel, Yves Saint Laurent, Marc Jacobs, Donna Karan, Prada, Valentino, Versace, Louis Vuitton, Bally, Jason Wu, Max Mara, Escada, Michael Kors, and Maybelline. She also appeared in two music videos. Fellow model Yasmin Le Bon got her husband Simon Le Bon of Duran Duran to feature Turlington in their \"Notorious\" video in 1986, at the age of 17. In 1990, singer George Michael drew inspiration from Peter Lindbergh's January 1990 British \"Vogue\" cover (which features Turlington, Campbell, Linda Evangelista, Cindy Crawford, and Tatjana Patitz) for his \"Freedom!\" video. The video featured all top 5 female models along with their top 5 male counterparts, lip-syncing the song. The video was shown during George Michael's 2008 concert tour while he sang. She was added on as the fourth model investor, after Elle Macpherson, Naomi Campbell and Claudia Schiffer of the now defunct Fashion Cafes.\n\nIn honor of Turlington's fortieth birthday, \"W\" magazine put together a collection of notable images from her career, from runway shots from the late eighties to today. In 2008, casting agent James Scully said regarding Turlington:\n\nTurlington was one of the faces to land in one of the fourteen covers of \"V magazine\" September 2008 issue. Each cover boasts a head shot of a famous model, either from the new crop of leading models or the supermodel era, it was lensed by duo Inez van Lamsweerde and Vinoodh Matadin.\n\nShe featured in the Bally spring/summer 2009 campaign alongside Oriol Elcacho.\n\nIn the 2000s, she has become a partner in a variety of business ventures: an ayurvedic skincare line, Sundari, and two clothing lines produced by Puma, an active women's clothing line; and a women's yoga-wear line.\n\nShe has contributed writings to \"Marie Claire\", \"Yoga Journal\", and \"Teen Vogue\" along with contributions to the \"Huffington Post\". She has also contributed to NBC’s \"Today Show\" as a guest correspondent, which included reporting on the status of girl’s education in Afghanistan in early 2002 and an interview with H.H. Dalai Lama at his home in Dharamshala, India.\n\nShe was also an initial product tester for the Apple Watch launch in 2015, participating in the press conference and allowing them to film a segment featuring her use of the Apple Watch to train for a marathon.\n\nIn 2005 Turlington began working with the international humanitarian organization CARE and has since become their Advocate for Maternal Health. She is also an Ambassador for Product Red.\n\nAfter suffering complications in her own 2003 childbirth, and upon learning that over 500,000 women die each year during childbirth (of which 90% of the deaths are preventable), Turlington was inspired to pursue a Master's degree in Public Health at the Columbia University Mailman School of Public Health.\n\nTurlington visited Swaziland in May 2007 on behalf of Product Red, and El Salvador and Peru in 2005 and 2008, respectively, on behalf of CARE. Her involvement with CARE was influenced by her mother, Elizabeth, who has been a longtime CARE supporter through her former flight attendants’ organization, World Wings. The FEMME project, a coming together of CARE, Columbia University, and local government, brings health-care practitioners together to find better methods of serving the large number of women needing assistance who are too intimidated to seek help in a clinic or traditional hospital.\n\nIn September 2010, Turlington participated in a CARE Learning Tour to Ethiopia to investigate the work being done to reduce maternal deaths.\n\nTurlington currently serves on the Harvard Medical School Global Health Council, and as an advisor to the Harvard School of Public Health Board of Dean’s Advisors, She is a member of White Ribbon Alliance for Safe Motherhood and Mother’s Day Every Day.\n\nAn ex-smoker whose father died of lung cancer, Turlington is an anti-smoking activist.\n\nTurlington made her directorial debut on the 2010 documentary film \"No Woman, No Cry\". The 60 minute documentary profiles the status of maternal health and focuses on four cases: from Tanzania, Bangladesh, Guatemala, and the United States. The film made its world premiere at the 2010 Tribeca Film Festival in the United States, and the U.S. television broadcast premiere aired on the new Oprah Winfrey Network (OWN) on May 7, 2011. The documentary earned Turlington a nomination for the Do Something With Style Award from the VH1 Do Something Awards.\n\nConcurrent with the debut of her documentary \"No Woman, No Cry\", Turlington launched Every Mother Counts (EMC), a non-profit 501(c)(3) organization dedicated to making pregnancy and childbirth safe for every mother. Every Mother Counts informs, engages, and mobilizes new audiences to take actions and raise funds that support maternal health programs around the world. EMC currently supports programs in Haiti, Uganda, Malawi, Indonesia, and the United States.\n\nTurlington completed her first New York City Marathon in 2011, running with Team Every Mother Counts to raise awareness for maternal and child health. She also ran the 2013 ING NYC Marathon with Team EMC and 2013 Hood to Coast Relay, which is featured in her documentary film, Every Mile, Every Mother.\n\nThe charity released a short film series entitled \"Giving Birth in America\" some-time a little before May 2015.\n\n\"Every Mother Counts\" is a compilation album that was released in 2011 exclusively to Starbucks, with a proportion of the proceeds to be donated to CARE and the Every Mother Counts organisation to support its maternal health care programs in coffee growing countries worldwide.\n\n\"Every Mother Counts 2012\" is a compilation album that was released in 2012 in partnership with Starbucks. U.S. $8 from the sale of each CD in participating Starbucks stores during 2012 is \"to be given in support of Every Mother Counts\".\n\nIn 2015, Turlington signed an open letter which the ONE Campaign had been collecting signatures for; the letter was addressed to Angela Merkel and Nkosazana Dlamini-Zuma, urging them to focus on women as they serve as the head of the G7 in Germany and the AU in South Africa respectively, which will start to set the priorities in development funding before a main UN summit in September 2015 that will establish new development goals for the generation.\n\nIn 2000, Turlington met actor, director, and writer Edward Burns at a Hamptons party, and by the end of the year they were engaged. In 2002 and just months after buying a New York property together, they decided to split up. The couple reunited and were married in June 2003. Despite numerous erroneous media reports, Turlington was not given away by good friend Bono. Bono attended the San Francisco wedding but Turlington said, \"[Bono] was there, of course, but I gave myself away. I mean, I was 25 weeks pregnant at the time. Eddie met me halfway down the aisle.\" Burns and Turlington have two children, Grace (born 2003) and Finn (born 2006). Turlington's sister Kelly is married to Edward's brother Brian Burns.\n\nShe was raised Catholic and still practices the religion to this day.\n\nTurlington began smoking at 13 and was smoking a pack a day by age 16. At age 26, she quit smoking. However, in 2000 at age 31, when undergoing a lung scan to raise awareness about current technology, she was diagnosed with early-stage emphysema.\n\nTurlington is a practitioner of yoga, specifically a type of yoga known as Jivamukti. Turlington has practiced yoga since 1987. Within an article published April 15, 2001 she stated she practiced three times a week, during the morning time. She credits yoga with bringing her closer to her Catholic faith.\n\nShe is the author of the book \"Living Yoga: Creating A Life Practice\", first published in 2002, is now within a third edition (2002, 2003, 2005). The 2002 text has a foreword by Robert Thurman. Turlington was involved in the editing of the January–February 2001 edition of \"Yoga Journal\".\n\nShe has run four marathons during her life (April 2015), including the London marathon, her personal best is 3 hours and 46 minutes. Her first marathon was run during 2011 within New York City. Part of her training for the London Marathon, which she ran during 2015, was a half-marathon run, within Tanzania. She trained using the Apple Watch during 2015 (prior to the public release of the watch). Prior to her first marathon, Turlington was running distances of 3 to 5 miles a day, \"a few times a week\", a pattern of running typical for her for periods throughout her life.\n\n"}

{"id": "28356401", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=28356401", "title": "Clinical trial portal", "text": "Clinical trial portal\n\nA clinical trial portal (also known as clinical portal or clinical study portal) is a web portal or enterprise portal that primarily serves sponsors and investigators in a clinical trial. Clinical portals can be developed for a particular study, however study-specific portals may be part of larger, clinical sponsor or Contract Research Organization (CRO) portals that cover multiple trials. A clinical portal is typically developed by a sponsor or CRO to facilitate centralized access to relevant information, documentation and online applications by investigational sites participating (or considering participation) in a trial, as well as for the monitors, study managers, data managers, medical, safety and regulatory staff that help plan, conduct, manage and review the trial.\n\nA clinical trial investigator portal (also known as clinical investigator portal) focuses on facilitating sponsors' recruitment and training of investigators and the ongoing exchange of information and completion of documentation with them during the life-cycle of a clinical study. Rather than using postal- or e-mail, documents such as confidentiality agreements, regulatory documents, safety documents, the study protocol and investigator brochure can be made centrally available in a suitably capable portal to all investigators being considered for a trial in an efficient and convenient manner. Several pharmaceutical companies have implemented enterprise-level Clinical Trial Portals and realized reductions study cost and cycle times. Portals have evolved from uni-dimensional communication, pushing information from Sponsor to Sites, to a more multi-directional communication center.\n\nA typical Clinical Trial Portal includes a database of clinical research Investigators (doctors who are experienced in conducting clinical research trials). The Investigator Database profiles the experience and capabilities of each Investigator and includes an online survey and ranking application to help study teams select the best Investigator for a given study.\n\nSponsors and study sites are required to negotiate and complete a series of regulatory, business and financial documents prior to commencing a clinical trial. The Secure Document Exchange technology of a clinical trial portal facilitates this process online vs by paper and overnight carrier offering significant financial and environmental advantages.\n\nElectronic and digital signatures can be applied to most document and content types (including training) within a clinical trial portal to reduce cost, timelines, and paper processes.\n\nClinical Trial Portals can facilitate the distribution and tracking of safety reports (MedWatch, CIOMS, etc.) to study sites, IRBs and Ethics Committees in a secure environment. These applications use sophisticated algorithms to ensure the safety reports are distributed to the correct users.\n\nClinical researchers are paid in the form of \"grants\" which are processed when certain milestones are achieved. The grants are typically negotiated prior to study start up. Most clinical trial portals include a secure document exchange technology that facilitates the negotiation of these grants as well as an application that tracks the processing of each grant.\n\nTraining of study teams and site staff is becoming more important as the industry shifts to a more technology-driven environment. Clinical Trial Portals may include an LMS (Learning Management System) to deliver and track on and offline training and certification.\n\nClinical Trial Portals can provide a single-sign-on capability using a SAML (Security Assertion Mark-up Language) technology to reduce the number of websites and credentials that are typically required to conduct a clinical trial. Links to other clinical trial technologies being used for a study can be incorporated into the portal to provide users with a common technology platform for the studies they conduct.\n\nReporting on study and site progress throughout a clinical trial is a critical component of a Clinical Trial Portal for Study Managers and Site Monitors. Reports should be available at the study, country, site and user level and should the assignment/completion of tasks, audit trails on all activity, recruitment/enrollment progress, and other milestone/timeline driven activities. In addition, portals can incorporate data from other clinical trial systems to provide meaningful dashboard and detail level reports that help manage the overall study progress.\n\nGlobal patient recruitment and retention campaigns are complicated to deploy and track due to the complex submission/approval process that IRBs and ethics committees require on a country-by-country basis. Clinical Trial Portals can include patient recruitment management applications that track actual vs projected enrollment, site recruitment plans, IRB/EC submission/approval dates, recruitment material management, outreach tactics and ROI.\nAs most of the trials suffer by time delays by both patient recruitment issues and patient drop-outs, Trial Portals having the ability to interact with Patients can enhance the patient motivation to stay in a trial.\n\n"}

They were commissioned by various rulers of Ancient and Medieval Nepal. Dhunge Dharas were made both for public and private use, and consist of intricately carved stone water ways through which water flows uninterrupted from underground water sources. Some Dhunge Dharas were later made from metals like copper and silver as well.\n\nThe structures related to the storage, distribution and access to water- the ponds, wells, fountains, riverside ghats-are ubiquitous elements of the cultural landscape of the Kathmandu valley. Such water related structures are both utilitarian as well as architectural and engineering achievements. The meritorious function is combined with the form in ways that it creates the individually magnificent monuments and enhances the architectural design of any urban area. Not only for the mere use of water, has it had a great significance in social, cultural and historical aspects.\n\nWater is taken as the symbol of sacredness and is considered the holiest of all. The vessel full of water, the wells, the fountains from which it issues, the pond that contains it or the stream in which it flows all are meant to be sacred. Providing access to water is thought to be very much praiseworthy which is seen till the date in the jatras and festivals. People serve the water to pilgrims and pedestrians carrying in the vessels on their shoulders to get the heavenly virtues. A significant merit is achieved whose value to society is matched by the religious merit accruing to the donor. Thus century after century of construction by the kings and common people, each according to their means, has left no corner of the valley without the water sources. These water sources comprises the elegantly carved stone structures forming dhunge dharas (lo hitis), brick lined reservoirs known as \"pokhari\" in Nepali and \"pukhu\" in Newari.\n\nFormerly, as commendable act, drinking water was often made accessible by means of small covered tanks known as jahru in Newari (from Sanskrit jala droni). They consist of a stone trough varying in size, fixed on a masonry support or built into a wall or the side of fountain. The jahru carrying few gallons of water is replenished by means of a funnel arrangement in the rear side of the structure. The jahru is provided with one or more stoppers at the front on the reservoir. In keeping with the traditional way of the spigot at will and drink directly beneath it.\n\nSince the lichhavis reign to more recently, the jahrus were established at the temples, tirthas, in the streets and squares. They are often built near a well or fountain to facilitate refilling them. Those jahrus are usually under a guthi endowment. The guthi serves as a care taker of the jahrus. Every first date of Baisakh the guthi performs ritual to pray the water god and renovates the jahrus. These jahrus can be found in combination with the well and nearby public shelter (pati).In addition to their utilitarian use and architectural interest, the water sources are culturally important in many other ways. Typically constructed as meritorious act, the reservoirs the hitis and the jahrus often bear dated stone inscriptions that are also important historical sources. No longer, or rarely used, most are in ruins, and their troughs abandoned or adopted to other uses as a stepping stone (upside down) at Bhairava chowk, Taumadhi-tol Bhaktapur . Among few used jahrus, the tadha jahru at tangal, patan is one and is maintained well till the date by the Joshi Guthi.\n\nNot only the sanctity of water itself and its utilitarian use but also for the architectural, cultural and historical significance such structures need the immediate renovation and conservation. If even a small step could be moved for its conservation by reusing those magnificent structures it would be our great achievement in helping our culture, history and architecture to live longer. The request is for all the archaeologists, historians, architecture practitioners and commoners to conserve it.\n"}

This is the most common cause of greenish discharge.\nMammary duct ectasia can mimic breast cancer. It is a disorder of peri- or post-menopausal age.\n\n\"Duct ectasia syndrome\" is a synonym for nonpuerperal mastitis but the term has also been occasionally used to describe special cases of fibrocystic diseases, mastalgia or as a wastebasket definition of benign breast disease.\n\nCorrelation of duct widening with the \"classical\" symptoms of duct ectasia syndrome is unclear. However, duct widening was recently very strongly correlated with noncyclic breast pain.\n\nDuct diameter is naturally variable, subject to hormonal interactions. Duct ectasia syndrome in the classical meaning is associated with additional histological changes.\n\nSigns of duct ectasia can include nipple retraction, inversion, pain, and sometimes bloody discharge.\n\nThe duct widening is commonly believed to be a result of secretory stasis, including stagnant colostrum, which also causes periductal inflammation and fibrosis. However, because nonspecific duct widening is common it might be also coincidental finding in many processes.\n\nSmokers seem more often affected by duct ectasia \"syndrome\" although the reported results are not entirely consistent. The correlation with smoking status appears weaker than for subareolar abscess. Correlation with the actual duct widening is not known.\n\nBoth duct widening and duct ectasia syndrome are frequently bilateral, hence systemic causes are likely involved.\n\nNoninvasive methods to determine duct diameter in live patients are available only recently and it is not clear how the results should be compared with older results from biopsies.\n\nHistologically, dilation of the large duct is prominent. Duct widening with associated periductal fibrosis is frequently included in the wastebasket definition of fibrocystic disease.\n\nIn plasma cell rich lesions diagnosed on core biopsies, steroid-responsive IgG4-related mastitis can be identified by IgG/IgG4 immunostaining.\n\nThe term \"duct ectasia syndrome\" has been used to describe symptoms of nonpuerperal mastitis, possibly associated with nipple inversion and nipple discharge. In some contexts, it was used to describe a particular form of nonpuerperal mastitis coincident with fibrocystic disease, frequently involving pasty (coloured) nipple discharge, nipple retraction, retroareolar abscess and blue dome cysts. Abscessation is not very frequent but by some definitions recurrent subareolar abscess is merely a variant of duct ectasia syndrome - abscessation would be obviously more frequent with this definition.\n\nDuct ectasia syndrome has been associated with histopathological findings that are distinct from a simple duct widening. In addition to nonspecific duct widening the myoepithelial cell layer is atrophic, missing or replaced by fibrous tissue. The original cuboidal epithelial layer may be also severely impaired or missing. Characteristic calcifications are often visible on mammographic images.\n\nPeriductal mastitis, comedo mastitis, secretory disease of the breast, plasma cell mastitis and mastitis obliterans are sometimes considered special cases or synonyms of duct ectasia syndrome.\n\nThe condition is usually self-limiting, and thus not indicated for surgery.\nThe term has several meanings on histological and symptomatic levels and on both levels \"usage\" overlaps with mastalgia, fibrocystic disease and specific sub- or superclasses of nonpuerperal mastitis. While this is not ideal for a definition it results from actual usage in international literature. Because research literature regarding duct ectasia is anything but abundant it is probably easiest to determine the exact meaning(s) intended by the respective authors on a case by case basis and this section can offer only a few hints.\n\nTypical usage in North America is a synonym of nonpuerperal mastitis, including the special cases of granulomatous mastitis, comedo mastitis, subareolar abscess with or without squamous metaplasia of lactiferous ducts and fistulation.\n\nSimple duct widening should be carefully distinguished from more complex histological changes.\n"}

The former effect is paradoxical because the effectiveness of an antibiotic generally rises with increasing drug concentration.\n\nProposed mechanisms:\n\nPenicillin is a bactericidal antibiotic that works by inhibiting cell wall synthesis but this synthesis only occurs when bacteria are actively replicating (or in the log phase of growth). In cases of extremely high bacterial burden (such as with Group A Strep), bacteria may be in the stationary phase of growth. In this instance since no bacteria are actively replicating (presumably due to nutrient restriction) penicillin has no activity. This is why adding an antibiotic like clindamycin, which acts ribosomally, kills some of the bacterial and returns them to the log phase of growth .\n"}

The originality of his theory is based on the dialectical view of the functioning of the groups and the relationship between dialectic, homeostasis and cybernetic.\n\nPichon-Rivière was born on June 25, 1907 in Geneva, Switzerland, his parents were French. His father had two daughters and three sons from a first marriage, when she died, his father remarried with his sister-in-law, first cousin of his dead wife. Enrique is the only one born of this marriage and, consequently, the youngest of the family. Both Alphonse and Josephine, his parents, disowned their bourgeois origins, embracing progressive ideas and a rebellious attitude to cultural norms of the time, both were fans of \"rebel\" poetry such as Rimbaud and Baudelaire, with strong socialist convictions and rejected racism and sexist stereotypes that prevailed at the start of the 20th century.\n\nIn 1910, his family went to Buenos Aires and later moved to Chaco. His father, who had been a soldier in the Military Academy of Saint-Cyr, was sent by his family to England to learn about the textile industry, then the family decided to move to Argentina, for reasons that Enrique Pichon-Rivière himself said he was unaware, and his father began to exploit land concessions granted by the Argentine State, where he tried to produce cotton, but without success. Thus, they had to move to Corrientes, a city on the Paraná River, with permanent flood and forest environment, a place where he spent his childhood. He was influenced by the Guarani culture,he had daily contact with the indigenous an their peasant modest lives. There, he learned to speak French first and then the Guaraní and Castilian.\n\nWhen Enrique was 6 or 7 years old, he learned what he called \"the great family secret\": his brothers and sisters were actually his stepbrothers and stepsisters.\n\nHe attended high school in the city of Goya and, upon completion, he founded the Partido Socialista de Goya.\n\nIn 1924 he began his medical studies in the city of Rosario, ending in 1936 in the city of Buenos Aires. In Rosario he worked for a while as \"instructor of manners\" for sex workers of Polish origin in a brothel (whorehouse). Later he studied Anthropology, leaving the career to devote himself to psychiatry and to psychoanalysis.\n\nHe began his practice as a psychiatrist at the \"El Asilo de Torres\" (Tower Asylum), located in the vicinity of Luján, Buenos Aires. Later, he moved to Buenos Aires, where he would work in another sanatorium and as a journalist in the newspaper \"La Crítica\" (\"The Critic\") (1930–1931), in this period he became interested in poetry, paying particular attention to the French Poète maudit and Isidore Ducasse.\n\nWhen he finished his studies, he began working at the Hospice of Mercy, now known as Interdisciplinary Psicoasistencial Hospital \"Jose Tiburcio Borda\", a place which played professionally for 15 years.\n\nIn the early 1940s, founded with Angel Garma, Celes Ernesto Carcamo, Marie Langer and Arnaldo Rascovsky, the \"Asociación Psicoanalítica Argentina\" (APA) (Argentine Psychoanalytic Association) of which then he would leave, becoming interested in the social aspect and activity of society groups, leading him to work at the \"Escuela de Psicología Dinámica\" (School of Psychology) of the then called \"Escuela de Psicología Social\" (School of social Psychology).\n\nIn 1937 he married with the renowned psychoanalyst Aberastury, who was known for her friendship with his brother, Federico, and she was one of the members of the newly formed APA; Aberastury influenced in the theories developed by Pichon-Rivière, given the expertise that she had made in the studies of Melanie Klein and Sophie Morgenstern methods.\n\nIn 1953 Enrique created the first private school of Social Psychology.\n\nIn 1955, together with Gino Germani and with the support of the Faculty of Economics, Institute of Statistics, Faculty of Philosophy and Psychology Department and the Faculty of Medicine at Rosario founded the \"Instituto Argentino de Estudios Sociales\" (Argentine Institute of Social Studies -IADES-), assuming the role of director.\n\nIn 1972, his wife Aberastury decided to commit suicide, according to some people close to the family for a skin disease that had disfigured her. Pichon-Riviere began a relationship with his former student and collaborator Ana Quiroga, whom he met in 1965.\n\n"}

It is an approach to oral health that requires the application and examination of relevant scientific data related to the patient's oral and medical health. Along with the dentist's professional skill and expertise, EBD allows dentists to stay up to date on the latest procedures and patients to receive improved treatment. A new paradigm for medical education designed to incorporate current research into education and practice was developed to help practitioners provide the best care for their patients. It was first introduced by Gordon Guyatt and the Evidence-Based Medicine Working Group at McMaster University in Ontario, Canada in the 1990s.\n\nThe term evidence-based medicine (EBM) is defined as \"the integration of best research evidence with clinical expertise and patient values.\"\n\nThe new model set by EBM utilizes a systematic process to incorporate current research into practice. The evidence-based process requires the practitioner to develop five key skills:\n\nThe American Dental Association defined evidence-based dentistry like so:\nThe American Dental Education Association (ADEA) has incorporated the definition of evidence-based dentistry into core competencies required by dental education programs. These competencies focus on graduates to become lifelong learners and consumers of current research findings and require students to develop skills that are reflective of evidence-based dentistry.\n\nA dentist's learning curve for using the evidence-based process can be steep, but there are continuing education courses, workbooks and tools available to simplify the integration of current research into practice.\n\nDental Graduates around the globe are up to date at the time they graduate. But this becomes out of date as new information and technology appear. Hence it is important, especially with regards to patient safety, for dentists to be able to keep up to date with developments. \nHaving an understanding of how to interpret research results, and some practice in reading the literature in a structured way, can turn the dental literature into a useful and comprehensible practice tool. For this to happen, EBD learning absolutely needs to be at the heart of dental education.\ndental students can be taught EBD concept during their time in dental school so that the will develop ability to evaluate critically new knowledge and to determine its relevance to the clinical problems and challenges presented by the individual patient.They also acquire ability to interpret, assess, integrate, and apply data and information in the process of clinical problem solving, reasoning, and decision making. EBD is a life long learning process and help to develop ability to learn independently.\n\nEvidence-based dental journals have been developed as resources for busy clinicians to aid in the integration of current research into practice. These journals publish concise summaries of original studies as well as review articles. These critical summaries, consist of an appraisal of original research, with discussion of the relevant, practical information of the research study.\n\nSystematic reviews are also helpful for the busy practitioner because they combine the results of multiple studies that have investigated the same specific phenomenon or question.\n\n"}

The groundbreaking works of Karen Horney argued that male realities cannot describe female psychology or define their gender because they are not informed by girls' or women's experiences. Theorists, thus, claim this new approach is required. There is the position that women's social existence is crucial in understanding their psychology. For instance, it is claimed that some characteristics of female psychology emerge to comply with the given social order defined by men and not necessarily because it is the nature of their gender or psychology. \n\nThe feminine psychology is often attributed to the pioneering work of Horney, who was the first woman to present a paper on feminine psychology at an international meeting. She famously contradicted Sigmund Freud's psychoanalytic theory, arguing that it is male-dominated and, therefore, harbored biases and phalocentric views. For this reason, such theory - Horney claimed - cannot describe femininity because it is informed by male reality and not by actual female experience. For instance, there is the case of Freud's proposition that the female personality tends to exhibit the so-called penis envy, where a girl interprets her failure to possess a penis as a punishment for wrongdoing and later blames her mother responsible. As Freud stated, \"she has seen it and knows that she is without it and wants to have it.\" Horney argued that it is not penis envy but a basic anxiety, hostility, and anger towards the opposite-sex parent, whom she views as competition for the affection of the same-sex parent, thus, a direct threat to her safety and security. Her view, which formed a significant part of her feminine psychology theory, is that this aspect should be resolved based on interpersonal dynamics (e.g. differences in social power) than sexual dynamics.\n\nHorney countered the Freudian concept with her own \"womb envy\" theory where men envy women's capability to bear children and they compensate for it with achievement and success. She deconstructed penis envy and described it as nothing more than women wanting to express their own natural needs for success and the security that is characteristic of both sexes. There is an analogy that describes Horney's feminine psychology as optimistic in the sense of world and life affirmation in comparison with Freud's pessimism oriented towards world and life negation. In the fourteen papers she wrote about feminine psychology, Horney offered a new way of thinking about women, underscoring how they should not gain value through their husbands, children, and family.\n\nOne dynamic outlined by feminine psychologists is the balancing act that women partake in between the more traditional role of motherhood and the more modern one of a career woman. Balancing the roles means attempting to satisfy both the need for personal achievement and the need for love and emotional security.\n\nThis does not mean that the roles contradict each other. The additional income from work may both relieve some stress and give the mother the ability to provide greater advantages (education, healthcare) to her children. Working also allows women to feel as though they are making a contribution to society beyond the family. A more fulfilled mother, in most cases, will be a better mother. Although this is true, many children feel neglected by their mothers when they are more focused on their career Twenty three percent of mothers feel that they are not spending enough time with their children, but believe that their children will become more independent and understanding once they get older.\n\nA lot has changed throughout the years as mothers and fathers both feel the pressure of balancing both work and family life. Fifty six percent of mothers say that handling work and family life is difficult for them as they are doing more than just housework and child care. Adding to the burden is society's concept that the mother's role is to spend more time with their children. A study conducted by the Pew Research Center indicates that 42% of respondents believe that a mother who works part-time is an ideal scenario while 16% thinks that working full-time is ideal for mothers, and the rest think that mothers should stay at home.\n\nIn addition, fathers have always been viewed as the bread makers in the family. However, times have changed and they are now more included in the parenting role. Fathers spend more time at home and they engage in taking care of their children and helping around the house a lot more than they did a century ago. For example, 50% of working fathers state that it is extremely difficult to balance work and taking care of their children (Pew Research Center 2012). The Pew Research Center also asked parents to rate themselves as good or bad parents. It was found that most mothers rated themselves a lot higher than fathers did and working mothers rated themselves a lot higher than non-working mothers did (Pew Research Center 2012).\n\nAccording to a study conducted by Dr. Jennifer Stuart, sometimes the history of the woman affects how she chooses to balance the two roles, or if she will balance at all. Specifically, Stuart asserts that the primary determinant is a woman's \"quality of her relationship with her mother. Women whose mothers fostered feelings of both warm attachment and confident autonomy may find ways to enjoy their children and/or work, often modifying work and family environments in ways that favor both\".\n\nSome women have no choice other than to work while raising children because of financial need. Others work for personal fulfillment. In either case, women are making compromises in their careers so that they can balance paid work and motherhood responsibilities. They are cutting back hours and accepting lower pay or a lower job status. In order to make the compromise, they have chosen to be satisfied with being average rather than being a top performer in the workplace (Kapur, 2004).\n\nWhat mothers have to remember, according to Dr. Ramon Resa, is that \"children are fairly resilient and will adapt to whatever changes are required. They are also astute at sensing unhappiness, disappointment and apathy\" (Resa, 2009). There is no harm in trying any path in order to find fulfillment, because no decision is permanent and can be changed as the situation warrants.\n\n\n\n"}

Skin cells, hair, clothing, and bedding are common hospital sources of contamination.\n\nFomites are associated particularly with hospital-acquired infections (HAI), as they are possible routes to pass pathogens between patients. Stethoscopes and neckties are two such fomites associated with health care providers. Basic hospital equipment, such as IV drip tubes, catheters, and life support equipment, can also be carriers, when the pathogens form biofilms on the surfaces. Careful sterilization of such objects prevents cross-infection.\n\nResearchers have discovered that smooth (non-porous) surfaces like door knobs transmit bacteria and viruses better than porous materials like paper money because porous, especially fibrous, materials absorb and trap the contagion, making it harder to contract through simple touch. Fomites include soiled clothes, towels, linens, handkerchiefs, cups, spoons, pencils, syringes, and surgical dressings. \n\nThe Italian scholar and physician Girolamo Fracastoro appears to have first used the Latin word \"fomes\", meaning \"tinder\", in this sense in his essay on contagion, \"De Contagione et Contagiosis Morbis\", published in 1546: \"By fomes I mean clothes, wooden objects, and things of that sort, which though not themselves corrupted can, nevertheless, preserve the original germs of the contagion and infect by means of these\".\n\nEnglish usage of \"fomes\", pronounced , is documented since 1658. The English word \"fomite\", which has been in use since 1859, is a back-formation from the plural \"fomites\" (originally borrowed from the Latin plural \"fōmĭtēs\" of \"fōmĕs\" ). The English-language pronunciation of \"fomites\" is , while the singular, \"fomite\", is pronounced .\n\nFomites play a conspicuous role in Steven Soderbergh's 2011 film \"Contagion\" about a pandemic.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "18555654", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=18555654", "title": "Food and water in New York City", "text": "Food and water in New York City\n\nIn New York City, there is an extensive water supply system that supports several programs and infrastructure pertaining to the city's food supply. City officials, agencies, and organizations cooperate with rural farmers to grow food more locally, as well as protect waterways in the New York metropolitan area. The New York City Department of Education operates a school-time and summertime breakfast/lunch program. However, New York City is also deprived of supermarkets in several neighborhoods, and the city has combatted this issue by allowing extra street vendors to operate in the city. To encourage food safety, New York City also has a restaurant-grading system that it introduced in 2010. Because of its various food programs, New York City has become a model for food systems internationally.\n\nGovernment officials, labor organizers, non-profits, community advocacy groups, and residents have a great dependency on rural farmers who develop New York City's local food shed. The process of linking agriculture with New York City’s urban markets has been largely built upon the fact that New York City's water supply comes from the protected Catskill Mountains watershed in Upstate New York. New York City's water supply system, the largest surface storage and supply complex in the world, yields of water daily, with most of this water originating upstate. This water is unfiltered, and a filtration system would require $8–10 billion in construction as well as $1 million in daily maintenance. Instead, New York City's watershed is protected by severe New York City Department of Environmental Protection restrictions that prevent pathogens and nutrients from entering the water supply. As a result of protection of the watershed, New York is one of four major cities in the United States with drinking water that is pure enough to not require purification by water treatment plants. However, the implementation of such stringent regulations is costly to New York State farmers.\n\nTo protect the water supply from runoff and promote regional agriculture, rural and urban New Yorkers developed an alliance called the \"New York City Watershed Whole Farm Program\", which promotes sustainable agriculture in New York State. With financial assistance from the city, upstate farmers reduce pathogen, nutrient, sediment, and pesticide runoff. Meanwhile, New York City’s urban population serves as a local market for upstate farmers, particularly through Greenmarket, a farmer's market founded in 1976 by the Council on the Environment of New York City. Upstate farmers sell their products at Greenmarket locations. \n\nGreenmarket provides regional small family farmers with opportunities to sell their fruits, vegetables and other farm products at open-air markets in the city. The program expanded to 45 markets in 2006—the largest expansion in its then-30-year history—but the resulting Greenmarket expansions were too small or too infrequently patronized to be profitable. The most famous Greenmarket location is the Union Square Greenmarket, held four days a week throughout the year. In 2003, 250,000 customers a week purchased 1,000 varieties of fruits and vegetables at the market.\n\nNew York City provides over 40,000 meals a day to children through the SchoolFoods program. Most of the fruit served in New York City Department of Education-operated public and charter schools is local. A project to bring New York State apples to New York City school cafeterias has also increased fruit consumption among school children. , policy work was focused on the task of bringing more local food to school lunches to give children healthy meals while supporting agriculture in the region. However, there is no plan to expand the program .\n\nThe NYCDOE also has a summer-meals program operated by SchoolFoods, which offers free lunches to children under 18. These summer lunches are distributed at over 1,100 parks, pools, libraries, schools, and shelters every year. Over 7 million lunches were distributed in summer 2012.\n\nNew York City faces a supermarket shortage in several neighborhoods that is closely linked to health epidemics. At the request of the Mayor’s office, the Department of City Planning studied supermarket need in the city. As a result, in April 2008, the Department found a widespread shortage of supermarkets, identifying several \"food deserts.\" It identified food deserts as a key factor in why over 700,000 people in New York City had diabetes, over 1.1 million New Yorkers were obese, and another 2 million were overweight.\n\nHealth problems are especially prevalent in minority communities. For instance, supermarkets in predominately-minority Harlem are 30 percent less common than on the predominately-white Upper East Side; while 20 percent of Upper East Side bodegas carried leafy green vegetables, only 3 percent of those in Harlem did so. Three million New Yorkers live in neighborhoods with high need for grocery stores and supermarkets, such as Harlem and Washington Heights in Manhattan; Bushwick, East New York, and Sunset Park in Brooklyn; Corona, Jamaica, and Far Rockaway in Queens; the South Bronx, Williamsbridge, Wakefield, and Pelham Parkway in the Bronx; and St. George and Stapleton in Staten Island show the greatest need for full-line supermarkets.\n\nIn February 2008, City Council Speaker Christine Quinn announced the creation of a Statewide Supermarket Commission that would identify state and local policy solutions to expand supermarkets and keep them open. The Commission would be led by the Food Trust and the Food Bank for New York City, in partnership with the City’s Food Policy Coordinator and the Food Industry Alliance. Simultaneously, the United Food and Commercial Workers Local 1500, which represents grocery store workers, worked to create healthy food options for all New Yorkers through supermarkets, community-supported agriculture, urban agriculture, and farmers' markets.\n\nAs part of an ongoing effort to increase access to healthy foods, the city created 1,000 new \"Green Cart\" permits in 2008. These permits were meant for street vendors who exclusively sell fresh fruits and vegetables, which must be raw and whole. These permits can be used only in neighborhoods where 15% or more of the population reported having consumed zero servings of fruits or vegetables in the previous 24 hours. Local businesses initially opposed the initiative, but a reduction in the number of permits allowed the program to be signed into law. After the program was approved, the city received funding and support from several partners to help further the program.\n\nA 2014 study by the Columbia University School of International and Public Affairs showed that although there were only 166 Green Carts in operation, these green carts were instrumental in raising exposure to healthy foods in poorer neighborhoods in Manhattan, the Bronx, Queens, and Brooklyn. The same study found that of these Green Carts, there were none on Staten Island.\n\nA grading system for New York City's 24,000 restaurants was launched in July 2010. Restaurant inspectors show up unannounced to the restaurant to inspect its hygiene, then give a ranking of A, B, or C depending on how many code violations the restaurant has. An \"A\" grade is considered the best grade (with 0 to 13 violations), with the highest standard for cleanliness; a \"B\" grade indicates 14 to 27 violations; and a \"C\" grade, the worst grade, indicates at least 28 violations. Restaurants then receive placards containing the restaurant's grades and post them in a prominent location. Each placard is embossed and tagged with a number as an anti-counterfeiting measure. Restaurateurs who get a \"B\" or \"C\" could request a re-review of their restaurants, getting \"Grade Pending\" placards in the meantime. As part of the launch, the New York City Department of Health and Mental Hygiene hired 23 inspectors, bringing the total number of inspectors to 180. It also raised the number of annual visits from 60,000 to 85,000.\n\nMichael Bloomberg, the then-mayor of New York City, stated that the practice was meant to reduce the number of foodborne illnesses and improve food safety. However, some restaurants avoid being regulated by registering as supermarkets or warehouses. Within 18 months of the grading system's implementation, salmonella infections dropped by 14%, but the total amount of the fines issued rose more than 145%, prompting large criticism. In 2014, the grading system was restructured to reduce fines. In 2016, ninety-three percent of restaurants got an \"A\" grade, the highest percentage in the history of the grading system.\n\nBecause of the way in which urban and rural New Yorkers have cooperated to create a protected ecosystem that brings healthy local food and clean water to a large urban population, New York City has become an international food systems model. The United Nations invited New York farmers, workers, retailers, and NGOs to act as representatives to the UN's Commission on Sustainable Development at its headquarters in New York City. The city hosted the UN's City and Farm Linkages Showcase in May 2008 to show New York State's urban–rural partnership to international leaders.\n"}
{"id": "14992240", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=14992240", "title": "Frendak v. United States", "text": "Frendak v. United States\n\nFrendak v. United States, 408 A.2d 364 (D.C. 1979) is a landmark case in which District of Columbia Court of Appeals decided that a judge could not impose an insanity defense over the defendant's objections.\n\nPaula Frendak shot a coworker. After four competency hearings, the defendant was adjudicated competent, although in the opinion of several experts she was likely insane when she committed the crime. However, Frendak refused to use the insanity defense as she felt a hospital was worse than any prison. She attempted suicide, went on hunger strikes and refused medication to underscore her protests. However, she was forced by the court to plead insanity. Thus, in this case a competent defendant was not allowed to reject the use of the insanity defense.\n\nOn appeal the decision was reversed. The judge may not impose the insanity defense upon an unwilling defendant if an intelligent defendant voluntarily wishes to forgo the defense. The court said that a defendant may feel hospital is worse than prison, that the term of incarceration may be longer, that the stigma and legal consequences of a criminal or an insanity defenses are different.\n\nUsing the U.S. Supreme Court decisions in \"North Carolina v. Alford\" and \"Faretta v. California\", the court concluded that \n\nThe court listed several disadvantages to choosing the insanity defense, including:\n\nThe court therefore limited any further competence inquiry to an evaluation of the defendant's specific competency to waive the insanity defense.\n\nThis decision examines the quality of the defendant's decision. If the defendant appears to be intelligently and voluntarily waiving the insanity defense, the trial court should not deny this. However, the trial court should look into whether the defendant has been properly informed of the effects of their decision as well as the alternatives available to them. Thus the nature of such an evaluation would be similar to a competency to stand trial evaluation.\n\nThe Frendak rationale, that a judge may not impose a sanity defense over the objections of the defendant, has been used mostly in federal cases. Some states have endorsed less elaborate procedures. For example, if a judge rules that the waiver of the insanity defense is not voluntary and informed, yet nonetheless the defense is imposed over the defendant's objections, then a separate counsel must be appointed to argue issues pertaining to insanity issues, while the defendant's counsel presents the arguments the defendant desires.\n\nHowever, as of 2002, seventeen jurisdictions permitted an insanity defense to be entered over the objections of the defendant. Thus these jurisdictions are, in effect, saying that a defendant who has been found competent to stand trial is not competent to rationally select his trial plea. Therefore a separate competency to refuse the insanity defense would have to be held that is similar to an evaluation of the defendant's mental state at the time of the offense.\n\nRealistically, because of the Supreme Court's holding in \"Godinez v. Moran\", it is most likely that the court would hold that if a defendant is competent to stand trial, then he is also competent to waive the insanity defense, as the two competencies are equivalent.\n\n\"Godinez v. Moran\" was modified and refined by the Supreme Court decision in \"Indiana v. Edwards\" in 2008.\n\n"}
{"id": "421823", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=421823", "title": "Health and social welfare in Communist Czechoslovakia", "text": "Health and social welfare in Communist Czechoslovakia\n\nIn the 1980s, Czechoslovakia had a comprehensive and universal system of social security under which everyone was entitled to free medical care and medicine, in theory at least. National health planning emphasized preventive medicine. Factory and local health care centers, first aid stations, and a variety of medical clinics supplemented hospitals and other inpatient institutions. The ratio of physicians to inhabitants has improved steadily, climbing from 1 per 745 in 1954 to 1 per 278 in 1985, although there were shortages of doctors in rural areas. The shift in the distribution of health resources in the 1960s and 1970s was dramatic; facilities were improved, and the number of health care personnel in Slovakia and rural areas increased in general. Despite the improvements, about 40% of all the medical equipment was obsolete, facilities were outdated and in short supply, the bureaucracy was excessive, and small bribery was widespread.\n\nSpas in Czechoslovakia were part of the health care system. In 1985 more than 460,000 people (5% of whom were children) stayed at the 35 spas in the Czech lands and 23 spas in Slovakia. Many spas had existed for centuries, such as Bardejov (since the 13th century) in Slovakia and Karlovy Vary in the Czech lands. Many of them specialized in the care and treatment of particular kinds of ailments. All had either mineral or hot springs, and some also offered mud treatments. In bygone days, the spas were frequented by European royalty and the wealthy, but in the 1980s they were open to all, including foreign tourists (who made up 10% of the patients in 1985). A number of people visited spas on vouchers provided by their trade unions.\n\nIn 1984 life expectancy in Czechoslovakia was 67 years for men and 75 years for women. In 1950 women's life expectancy was approximately 4.6 years longer than men's; by 1983 this difference had increased to nearly 7.5 years. Infant mortality stood at 10.5 per 1,000 live births in 1984, down from 15.6 per 1,000 in 1975. As with medical care, the gap in life expectancy between the Czech lands and Slovakia was narrowed during this period.\n\nIn 1985 slightly more than one-quarter of the Czechoslovak population received some kind of pension; the elderly, the disabled, widows, and orphans were all entitled to assistance. Social security benefits (primarily retirement and disability) were equal for all wage earners. The average pension was less than Kcs1,000 per month (workers received an average pension of about Kcs 1,130, cooperative farmers about Kcs880, and independent farmers about Kcs720); this put pensioners among the lowest income earners. A substantial minority of the retired (23%) again took up employment to supplement their pensions.\n\nWomen workers had a full complement of maternity and childcare benefits. Maternity leave (at 90% of full pay) was twenty-six weeks in the 1980s; an additional nine weeks were available for single mothers or for mothers having multiple births. Employers could not deny a woman's request for an additional year of unpaid leave for child rearing (without loss of job seniority). A system of child allowances and maternity grants also assisted women who took unpaid leave. Women were allowed three days of annual leave in case of illness within the family. There were substantial family allowances, in addition to direct grants, to single parents or families with handicapped children. An unmarried mother, widow, or divorced mother could not be fired if she had a child under three years of age; if she had children between three and fifteen years of age, her employer had to find her another job before dismissing her.\n\nNursery facilities for younger children were in very short supply; in 1984 they could accommodate less than 10% of children under five years of age. Beyond the sheer lack of space, nurseries were poorly distributed and were often concentrated in older centers rather than in new housing developments where young families were likely to reside. Kindergartens were in better supply, and a much higher percentage of children between the ages of three and six years attended these schools.\n\nHigh employment of women and inadequate services contributed to the decline in Czechoslovakia's birthrate in the 1960s. Live births during the decade averaged 16 per 1,000 inhabitants, a significant drop from the 1950s. By 1968 the fertility rate was under 2 children per woman (in comparison with almost 3 in the 1950s); at this rate the population would not replace itself. In the Czech lands, the population growth rate stood at its 1930s low; in Catholic Slovakia, it was the lowest on record. The government adopted a variety of explicitly pronatalist policies in the 1970s. Family allowances increased, especially for second and third children. By 1973 a family with three children received roughly one-third the average worker's salary in allowances. Birth grants doubled so that they were the equivalent of two to four weeks of family income. Low-interest loans to newlyweds were designed so that a portion of the principal was canceled with the birth of each child (Kcs 1,000 for the first and Kcs4,000 for each subsequent child). All told, the financial incentives were substantial. In addition, couples with children had priority on apartment waiting lists and were entitled to larger living quarters, no small inducement in the face of Czechoslovakia's chronic housing shortage. Pronatalist policies appear to have had a strong influence on population growth during the 1970s. The birthrate climbed from its 1968 low (14.9 per 1,000 inhabitants) to a peak of 19.9 per 1,000 inhabitants in 1974—one of the highest rates among industrial nations. Perhaps a quarter of this increase reflected the increase in the number of women of child-bearing age in the 1970s. After 1974, however, the birthrate steadily declined, falling to 14.5 by 1985. Figures indicated that a trend toward one-child families was emerging. The message seemed to be that after one decade the government's aid program was ineffective.\n\nA major factor influencing the birthrate was the abortion rate. The number of abortions fluctuated between the 1950s and 1980s, dropping in the early 1960s and the early 1970s. In 1985 there were reportedly 144,712 abortions, or 39 abortions per 100 pregnancies (33.5 per 100 in the Slovak Socialist Republic and 42.1 per 100 in the Czech Socialist Republic). It has been suggested that abortion has remained one of the most favored means of birth control, despite the risks involved. A 1986 change in the abortion law (eliminating the panel needed to approve a request for an abortion) suggested that the regime was giving up in its efforts to reverse at least this aspect of the adverse demographic trends.\n\nSince statistics did not always provide a comparison between the numbers of households and existing housing units, the housing deficit remained difficult to gauge. A comparison of the number of marriages annually and construction of new 1 housing units between 1960 and 1975 shows that construction exceeded marriages only in 1975. The deficit was most acute in the 1960s, when an average of housing units was built for every 10 marriages; in 1985 the ratio rose to an average of 8.8 units per 10 marriages.\n\nThis approximation underestimated the housing deficit: it ignored divorces, the number of extended families living together who would have preferred separate housing, and the decay of old housing . Even waiting lists underestimated how inadequate housing was in the 1980s. Separate housing for single adults had such a low priority with planners that single adults found it difficult even to get on a housing list.\n\nOne of the factors contributing to the housing shortage was the low construction rate of rental housing. Major reasons for this were high inflation, high construction costs, and low (heavily subsidized) rents. In 1985 the average building cost for apartments rose to Kcs2,523 per square meter, and the average monthly rent—for the seventh consecutive year—was Kcs358. Construction of individual homes peaked in 1977 at 40,107 and decreased to 29,608 in 1985. Building a home privately was possible, but acquiring labor and materials was difficult and sometimes risky; it often meant borrowing machinery illegally or paying bribes for materials.\n\nDespite substantial gains in the 1970s, Czechoslovakia entered the 1980s with a housing shortage that was likely to take years to remedy. In 1986 the government announced a slight cutback in new housing construction for the 1986–90 housing plan, further aggravating the situation.\n\n"}

Besides, changes in the demographic trends, epidemiology and mushrooming urbanization require more comprehensive services covering a wide range and quality of curative, promotive and preventive services. \n\nThe current Ethiopia health care financing strategy focus on financing of primary health care services in a sustainable manner. It envisions reaching universal health coverage by 2035. The prioritized initiatives are mobilizing adequate resources mainly from domestic sources, reducing out-of-pocket spending at the point of service use, enhancing efficiency and effectiveness, strengthening public private partnership and capacity development for improved health care financing. To operationalize the strategy, various reform measures were implemented. These reforms include: revenue retention and use at the health facility level; systematizing fee waiver system; standardization of exempted services; setting and revision of user fees; allowing establishment of private wing in public hospitals; outsourcing of non-clinical services ; and, promotion of health facility autonomy through establishment of a governance body; and establishment of health insurance system.\n\nAccording to the 6th National Health Accounts (2013/14), health service in Ethiopia is primarily financed from 4 sources: the federal and regional governments; grants and loans from bilateral and multilateral donors; non-governmental organizations and private contributions. The total health expenditure per capita has increased from $4.5 per capita in 1995/1966 to 20.77 in 2010/11 and $28.65 per capita in 2013/14.The share of total health expenditure coming from domestic sources has increased from 50 percent in 2010/11 to 64 percent in 2013/14.\n\nWhile mobilizing sufficient public resources and organizing pooling to maximize re-distributive capacity are essential for achieving equitable and affordable health care access for all, it is of equal importance that collected resources be efficiently used in order to maximize and sustain the provision of benefits for the population. Strategic use of the purchasing function is the key health financing instrument for this purpose. The main purchasers of health service in Ethiopia are: the Ministry of Health; Regional Health Bureaus; District/Woreda Health Offices in the form of line-item budgets; Ethiopia Health Insurance Agency; and, other government entities that transfer budget to service providers to reimburse service delivery cost; and households in the form of user fee. \nThere is fee waiver system to covers Indigents but with various challenges in implementation. The number of fee waiver beneficiaries has reached two million. While this progress is encouraging, it constitutes less than 10% of the total population that lives below the poverty line in the country.\n\nThroughout the 1990s, the government, as part of its reconstruction program, devoted ever-increasing amounts of funding to the social and health sectors, which brought corresponding improvements in school enrollments, adult literacy, and infant mortality rates. These expenditures stagnated or declined during the 1998–2000 war with Eritrea, but since outlays for health have grown steadily. In 2000–2001, the budget allocation for the health sector was approximately US$144 million; health expenditures per capita were estimated at US$4.50, compared with US$10 on average in sub-Saharan Africa. In 2000 the country counted one hospital bed per 4,900 population and more than 27,000 people per primary health care facility. The physician to population ratio was 1:48,000, the nurse to population ratio, 1:12,000. Overall, there were 20 trained health providers per 100,000 inhabitants. Health care is disproportionately available in urban centers; in rural areas where the vast majority of the population resides, access to health care varied from limited to nonexistent. \n\nIn 1993 the government published the country's first health policy in 50 years, articulating a vision for the health care sector development. The policy fully reorganized the health services delivery system as contributing positively to the country's overall socioeconomic development efforts. Its major themes focussed on: \nA Health Sector development Program was developed every five years beginning in 1997/98.\n\nIn 2002 the government embarked on a poverty reduction program that called for outlays in education, health, sanitation, and water. A polio vaccination campaign for 14 million children was carried out. In 2003 the government launched the Health Extension Program intended to provide universal primary health care coverage by 2009. This included placing two government-salaried female Health Extension Workers in every kebele, with the aim of shifting the emphasis of health care to prevention. About 2,700 completed their training by the end of 2004 at 11 technical and vocational education centers, while 7,000 were still in training in 2005, and over 30,000 were expected to complete their training by 2009. However, these trainees encountered a lack of adequate facilities, including classrooms, libraries, water, and latrines. The selection of trainees was flawed, with most being urban inhabitants and not from the rural villages they would be working in. Reimbursement was haphazard as trainees in some regions did not receive stipends while those in other regions did. In January 2005, the government began distributing antiretroviral drugs, hoping to reach up to 30,000 HIV-infected adults.\n\nAccording to the head of the World Bank's Global HIV/AIDS Program, in 2007 Ethiopia had only 1 medical doctor per 100,000 people. However, the World Health Organization in its 2006 World Health Report gives a figure of 1936 physicians (for 2003), which is about 2.6 per 100,000. There were 119 hospitals (12 in Addis Ababa alone) and 412 health centers in Ethiopia in 2005. Globalization is said to affect the country, with many educated professionals leaving Ethiopia for a better economic opportunity in better-developed countries.\n\nEthiopia's main health problems are said to be communicable diseases caused by poor sanitation and malnutrition. These problems are exacerbated by the shortage of trained manpower and health facilities. Ethiopia has a relatively low average life expectancy of 62/65 years in 2012. Only 20 percent of children nationwide have been immunized against all six vaccine-preventable diseases: tuberculosis, diphtheria, whooping cough, tetanus, polio, and measles. Rates of immunization are less than 3% of children in Afar and Somali Regions and less than 20% in Amhara, Benishangul-Gumuz, and Gambela. In contrast, almost 70% of children have received all vaccinations in Addis Ababa and 43%in Dire Dawa; children in urban areas were three times as likely to be fully immunized as children living in rural areas in 2008.\n\nThe Health Extension program was introduced in 2002/03 with a fundamental philosophy that if the right health knowledge and skill is transferred, households can take responsibility for producing and maintaining their own health. It is a community-based intervention designed to make basic health services accessible to the rural and underserved segments of the population. The HEP was launched in the four big agrarian regions, expanded to the remaining regions in subsequent years.\n\nIt was planned to cover all rural kebeles with the aim of achieving universal primary health care coverage by 2008. Services are organized along geographic lines with construction of a comprehensive network of primary health care units throughout the country with one health post in every rural kebele of 5000 people linked to a referral health center. A health post is a two-room structure of most peripheral health care unit and the first level for the provision of healthcare for the community, emphasizing preventive and promotive care. 33,819 health extension workers were trained and deployed surpassing the target of 33,033. Model households who have been trained and graduated have reached a cumulative total of 4,061,532 from an eligible total of 15,850,457 households. This only represented a coverage of 26% leaving a huge gap of more than 11 million households to be trained.\nThe total number of health professionals increased from the baseline of 6,191 in 2004/05 to 14,416 in 2009/10 but this was only 89% of the target. Equipping Health posts with medical kits remained a major challenge. Only 83.1% or 13,510 HPs out the planned target of 16,253 were fully equipped. Supportive supervision technical, reference books for rural HEP and manuals for school health program were prepared. An implementation Manual for Pastoralist and semi-pastoralist areas was finalized and distributed to respective regions. \nIn order to expand the Urban Health Extension program in seven regions of the country, 15 packages along with implementation manual were developed and distributed for implementation in Tigray, Amhara, Oromiya, the Southern Nations, Nationalities, and Peoples' Region, Harari, Dire Dawa, and Addis Ababa. These regions have trained and deployed a total of 2,319 Urban Health Extension workers achieving 42% of the required number.\nThe focus is disease prevention and health promotion, with limited curative care. It is the healthcare service delivery mechanism of the people, by the people, and for the people by involving the community in the whole process of healthcare delivery and by encouraging them to maintain their own health. The program involves women in decision-making processes and promotes community ownership, empowerment, autonomy and self-reliance. Ethiopia has come a long way in improving the health status of its people as evidenced by the achievement of most health related Millennium Development Goals.\n\nAddressing equity and quality of health services are the main focuses of the new Ethiopian Health Sector Transformation Plan. Improving the competence of health extension workers and the Women's Development Army is crucial. The second generation rural plan will include: upgrading health extension workers to level four Community Health Nurses, renovation and expansion of health posts, equipping and supplying health posts with the necessary equipment and supplies, shifting basic services to the community level and institutionalizing the WDA platform. In cities and urban areas, the Family Health Team approach will be introduced. The team will be composed of clinicians, public health professionals, environmental technicians, other health professional, social workers and health extension professionals to provide services for urban dwellers. Considering the varied nature of the community residing in the pastoralist and developing regions, the Ministry of Health, along with the Regional Health Bureaus is committed to developing a unique strategy to address pastoralist communities' health issues.\n\nBusiness Process Reengineering has been used as a tool for a comprehensive analysis, redesign and revamping of the health sector in Ethiopia. This is a country led, multisectoral undertaking implemented as a comprehensive approach to the government's civil service reform. Following a deeper and systematic analysis of the \"as is\" situation at all levels of the health system, including health facilities, the sector has brought in innovative approaches including, benchmarking best practices, redesign new processes, revising organizational structures and a selection of 8 core process and 5 support processes. The new 8 core processes are; \nThe 5 support processes designed were: \n\nMajor activities under the health facility construction, expansion, rehabilitation, furnishing and equipping focused mainly on the Primary Healthcare facilities: the number of public Health Centres increased from 412 in 1996/97 to 519 in 2003/04. For the same periods, the number of HPs increased from 76 in 1996/97 to 2,899. The number of hospitals (both public and private) increased from 87 in 1996/97 to 126 in 2003/04. There has been also considerable health facility rehabilitation program and furnishing. As a result, the potential health service coverage increased from 45% in 1996/97 to 64.02% by 2003/04. The plan was to attain a 100% general potential health service coverage by availing 3200 centres through construction, equipping and furnishing of 253 new ones and upgrading 1,457 HSs to HC level and also upgrading of 30% of HC to enable them perform Emergency Obstetric and Neonatal Care services\n\nAt the beginning of HSDP III, there were 82 all types of Hospitals (37 District, 39 Zonal and 6 Specialized Hospital). The planned target was to increase the number of hospitals to 89 (42 district and 41 zonal). By 2008/09 there were 111 Public Hospitals.\n\nIn addition, 12,292 health posts have been equipped which represents 75.6% of the target of equipping 16,253 health posts. 511 new ones will be equipped following their completion. The construction of 21 blood banks in six regions was 95% completed in 2009 and the preparation of a National Laboratory Master Plan has also been already completed.\n\nThere has been a focus on scaling up the training of community and Mid-Level Health Professionals. Accelerated Health Officer Training Program was launched in 2005, in five universities and 20 hospitals to address the clinical service and public health sector management need at district level. So far more than 5,000 health officer trainees (generic and upgrade) have been enrolled and 3,573 Health officers were graduated and deployed. In addition to address the need for Comprehensive Emergency Obstetric Care and other emergency surgery services, a curriculum for masters program on Emergency Surgery has been developed and training has been started in five universities. To address the critical shortage and maldistribution of doctors, in addition to the existing medical schools a new medical school that uses innovative approach has been opened in St. Paul's Hospital's Millennium Medical School.\n\nA human resources for health situation analysis conducted in 2015/2016 showed that between 2009 and 2014/15: \nApart from these selected health professionals, overall health professionals to population ratio increased from 0.84 per 1000 in 2010 to 1.5 per 1000 in 2016. This is remarkable progress for a 5-year period. If the current pace is sustained, Ethiopia will be able to meet the minimum threshold of health professionals to population ratio of 2.3 per 1000 population, the 2025 benchmark set by the World Health Organization (WHO), for Sub-Saharan Africa.\n\nThe marked improvement in the availability of health workers is due to massive scale up of production in the last two decades. The number of health worker training public higher educational institutions has increased from 8 to 57. Of these, 34 are universities and hospital-based colleges offering degree programs while 23 are regional health science colleges offering technical and vocational qualifications (level 1 to 5). Private health science colleges have also flourished, with 24 institutions offering accredited programs as of 2012/2013. The number of medical schools has risen to 33 (of which 5 are private) and public midwifery schools have reached 49. There has also been parallel expansion in enrollment and graduation outputs. Over sixty thousand health science students were enrolled in public higher education institutions; and an additional 15,834 in private higher educational institutions as of 2012/2013. Annual enrollment of health science students in public higher educational institutions reached close to 23,000 (58% in regional health science colleges) by 2014. Additionally, the annual intake of medical students rose by more than 2-fold from 1,462 in 2008 to 3,417 in 2014. Graduation output from higher educational institutions has increased by close to 16-fold from 1041 in 1999/2000 to 16,017 by 2012/2013.\nEthiopia is on track in scaling up the quantity of health worker production. However, capacity and readiness of higher educational institutions to assure quality of education has not developed proportionally. The Government of Ethiopia allocates up to 4.6% of its GDP, which is one of the largest in Africa, on education. However, most of it is capital budget, with limited resources available to enhance the core mission of quality and relevance of higher education.\n\n"}
{"id": "35325713", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=35325713", "title": "Healthcare in Luxembourg", "text": "Healthcare in Luxembourg\n\nHealthcare in Luxembourg is based on three fundamental principles: compulsory health insurance, free choice of healthcare provider for patients and compulsory compliance of providers in the set fixed costs for the services rendered. Citizens are covered by a healthcare system that provides medical, maternity and illness benefits and, for the elderly, attendance benefits. The extent of the coverage varies depending on the occupation of the individual. Those employed or receiving social security have full insurance coverage, and the self-employed and tradesmen are provided with both medical benefits and attendance benefits. That is all funded by taxes on citizens' incomes, payrolls and wages. However, the government covers the funding for maternity benefits as well as any other sector that needs additional funding. About 75% of the population purchases a complementary healthcare plan. About 99% of the people are covered under the state healthcare system.\n\nAccording to data from the World Health Organization (WHO), healthcare spending on behalf of the government of Luxembourg topped $4.1 Billion, amounting to about $8,182 for each citizen in the nation. The entirety of funding comes from domestic sources, where the government covers about 84% of healthcare funding with household expenditures covering the remaining costs. With the allocation of about 15% of total government expenditures toward health programs, the nation of Luxembourg collectively spent nearly 7% of its Gross Domestic Product on health, placing it among the highest spending countries on health services and related programs in 2010 among other well-off nations in Europe with high average income among its population. As a whole, health expenditures take up a share of total GDP at 1.8 percentage points under the average across OECD nations. Before healthcare reform took place in 1992, payment for healthcare services was based on a fee-per-service requirement, whereas now it is based on individual budgets negotiated between health insurance agencies and the hospitals at the nationwide level. The state role at most consists of working with care providers for accreditation, and management of contracts. Citizens pay at most 5% of their annual wage into the nationwide coverage program. \n\nMutual Medico-Surgical Fund (CMCM) \n\nAs Luxembourg's primary voluntary health insurance program, the \"Cause Médico-Chirurgicale Mutualiste (Mutual Medico-Surgical Fund)\" covers a wide range of services for citizens such as \n\nSocial Care \n\nCurrently in place is a law passed on September 8, 1998 between the state and non-governmental organizations, (NGO's) working in social care. Independent NGO's work alongside the Ministry of Health and the Ministry of Family and Social Welfare as one of the widest sectors in government assistance, extending social care in Luxembourg to include services such as drug prevention activities, shelter for the country's homeless and resources for single parents, such as childcare and recreational-type activities. Coverage for services deemed nonessential as part of compulsory health insurance frameworks is not only available, but widely utilized, with over 75% of the national population purchasing complementary health insurance to extend the range of care to non-useful services addressing non-threatening conditions. \n\nInsurance\n\nThe Statutory health insurance system in Luxembourg is responsible for the healthcare of 99% of its residents. This compulsory system of health insurance is managed and provided by the Union of Sickness Funds alongside 9 separate agencies among which the general population is distributed and allocated on the basis of the professional occupation they hold. All services rendered by professionals are defined and assessed under the Ministers of Social Security and Health. The Voluntary health insurance program has typically been limited as a direct result of the compulsory public system that covers the majority of the population' debts for medical services. \n\nAcross Luxembourg one of the greatest problems to the nations's health has been the high number of deaths from non-communicable diseases such as cancer, diabetes, cardiovascular disease, and chronic respiratory diseases, arising from a variety of factors, though most notably from substance abuse. Premature mortality as a direct result of NCD's has been a primary cause of death nationwide, with the probability of dying between the ages of 30 and 70 years at 11%, with cardiovascular disease, chronic respiratory disease, and cancer claiming the most lives among the middle-aged group . \n\nAlcohol\n\nLuxembourg boasts one of the highest levels of alcohol consumption among European nations, showcasing an average consumption rate of over 60% above the European average. Alcohol policy within the EU has promoted high levels of consumption through low prices and wide availability.The mortality rate from alcohol-related causes is one of the highest among other European nations such as Slovenia, Croatia, and Finland, evidently a direct result of high levels of consumption as part of harmful drinking patterns among people in Luxembourg. Contributory to high consumption is a relatively cheaper cost of strong alcohol items such as grain alcohol.According to OECD data, 35% of adults in Luxembourg in 2014 consumed large quantities of alcohol in one sitting. Alcohol abuse and dependency have accounted for a considerable share of the alcohol-related diseases observed in the cause of death among citizens . \n"}

It was also responsible for 30-40 tons of cocaine trans-shipment annually. \n\nUnder President Alfredo Stroessner's dictatorship (1954 - 1989), Paraguay is said to have become \"a sanctuary for smugglers in arms, drugs and everyday goods such as whiskey and car parts,\" and Stroessner provided refuge to heroin dealer Auguste Ricord.\n\nIn 1994 General Ramón Rosa Rodríguez, the head of Paraguay's national anti-drugs agency, Secretaría Nacional Antidrogas (SENAD), was assassinated whilst delivering a report to President Juan Carlos Wasmosy.

IHTSDO was founded in 2007 by 9 charter member countries (Australia, Canada, Denmark, Lithuania, Sweden, the Netherlands, New Zealand, the United Kingdom and the United States) in order to acquire the rights of SNOMED CT from the College of American Pathologists (CAP) and make the development of a global clinical language for healthcare an international, collaborative effort. \n\nIHTSDO governance is defined in the IHTSDO Articles of Association. The organization is headquartered in the United Kingdom (London).\n\nSince 2007 the number of Member countries has increased from nine to twenty nine. The Members were (as of December 2016): Australia, Belgium, Brunei, Canada, Chile, Czech Republic, Denmark, Estonia, Hong Kong, Iceland, India, Ireland, Israel, Lithuania, Malaysia, Malta, Netherlands, New Zealand, Poland, Portugal, Singapore, Slovakia, Slovenia, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, the United Kingdom, the United States and Uruguay. The Member countries provide the bulk of the institutional financing through payment of yearly Member fees, which are based on Gross National Income. Members of IHTSDO can be either an agency of a national government or another body (such as a corporation or regional government agency) which has been endorsed by an appropriate national government authority within the country it represents. Member countries commit themselves to the dissemination of the IHTSDO terminologies within their jurisdiction, including where appropriate the creation of local translations, extensions, and mappings.\nThe General Assembly (GA) is the organization's highest authority and is composed of representatives from all Member countries with equal representation (although some Member countries have not selected GA representatives and therefore are not represented in the GA). The GA is collectively charged with assuring that the purpose, objects and principles of the Association are pursued and that the interests of IHTSDO are safeguarded. The GA appoints the Management Board (MB), which has overall responsibility for the management and direction of IHTSDO and has a duty to act in the best interests of the organization. The Member countries are also represented by the Member Forum, which provides input on Member priorities and helps develop the IHTSDO plan of work.\n\nThe organization is structured into four major areas: customer relations, operations, products & services, and strategy.\n\nSeven Advisory Groups provide advice to the Management Team.

Frieden has been called \"a chief architect of the Americans with Disabilities Act.\" He is also regarded as a founder and leader of the independent living movement by people with disabilities in the U.S.\n\nLex Frieden was born in Alva, Oklahoma, a rural community in northwestern Oklahoma. He graduated from Alva Senior High School in 1967 and began studying electrical engineering at Oklahoma State University. It was as a freshman that he sustained a spinal cord injury in an automobile accident. As part of his rehabilitation from that injury, he went to TIRR Memorial Hermann in Houston, where he met Dr. William A. Spencer, the rehabilitation medicine visionary. Dr. Spencer became Lex's mentor.\n\nFrieden's service in the 1970s included membership on a Congressional task force on science, technology and disability empaneled by Olin E. Teague (1910–1981), U.S. Congressman from Texas. The panel's mission was to study what was and was not being done in disability-related research across the entire swath of the U.S. Government. That panel's work led, in 1978, to creation of the National Institute on Disability and Rehabilitation Research (NIDRR), a unit of the US Department of Education.\nFrieden was one of the major figures behind the enactment of the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990. As Executive Director of the National Council on Disability (NCD) in the mid-1980s, reporting to presidentially appointed Council members notably including Vice Chairman Justin Dart, Jr., Frieden oversaw the work of Robert Burgdorf in writing the first drafts of what was to become the ADA. The Council issued two major reports, \"Toward Independence\" and \"On the Threshold of Independence\", to further the effort along. President George H.W. Bush signed the ADA into law on July 26, 1990. Other significant legislation inspired by the Council while Frieden was director included the Air Carrier Access Act of 1986 (ACAA) and legislation to make national parks and recreation areas accessible to people with disabilities.\n\nAfter leaving NCD in 1988, Frieden was appointed by Congressman Major R. Owens, Chairman of the U.S. House of Representatives Subcommittee on Select Education, to be coordinator of the newly formed, Congressional Task Force on the Rights and Empowerment of Americans with Disabilities. The role of the task force was to gather information on the extent and nature of disability discrimination in America. Justin Dart, Jr. was named chairman of the group, and working together as they had for the past five years at NCD, they produced several reports and papers which congressional committees used in the process of considering and refining the ADA prior to passage.\n\nPresident George W. Bush appointed Frieden Chairman of the NCD and the Senate confirmed his appointment on July 26, 2002, the anniversary of the signing of the ADA. Frieden’s swearing in ceremony was conducted in the Oval Office by the President and by White House Chief of Staff Andrew Card. Under Frieden's leadership, the Council produced a report, \"Righting the ADA\", that made recommendations leading to enactment of the ADA Amendments Act of 2008, and they proposed a UN Convention on the Rights of People with Disabilities.\n\nOther Council priorities during Frieden's tenure as NCD chair centered on livable communities, adaptive technology and community-based services and supports for long-term care. His personal experience assisting with disaster response and recovery after Hurricanes Katrina and Rita motivated Council recommendations that resulted in passage of legislation to improve emergency preparedness and response for people with disabilities in disasters.\n\nFrieden is Professor of Health Informatics and of Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation at the University of Texas Health Science Center at Houston. He is also Professor (Adjunct) of Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation at Baylor College of Medicine. Frieden directs the Independent Living Research Utilization (ILRU) program at TIRR Memorial Hermann Hospital in Houston (The Institute for Rehabilitation and Research). In 2010, the Chancellor and Vice Chancellor for the University of Texas System appointed him Chancellors Health Fellow on Disability.\n\nFrieden is an Alumnus of the University of Tulsa. He was named a Distinguished Alumnus of the University in 1979, and in 2004, the Lex Frieden Presidential Scholarship was established by the University in his honor. He is also a graduate of the University of Houston. In 2004, he was awarded an honorary doctorate in law (LL.D.) by the National University of Ireland, Galway.\n\nIn 1983, Frieden was recognized as one of the Ten Outstanding Young Americans. He was the 1998 winner of the Henry B. Betts Award for outstanding achievement in disability rights. In 2011, the Texas Governor's Committee on People with Disabilities named its annual employment awards program after Frieden for his advocacy work regarding the employment of people with disabilities around the world. He also won the 2013 Henry Viscardi Achievement Awards. Frieden was awarded the prestigious Fries Prize for Human Improvement by the CDC Foundation in 2017.\n\nFrieden is a member and former chairperson of the Board of United Spinal Association. He serves on the board of the Sam Houston Area Council Boy Scouts of America. In 2016, Frieden was appointed by Houston Mayor Sylvester Turner to the board of METRO, the Metropolitan Transit Authority of Harris County, Texas.\n\nFrieden's extensive collection of ADA artifacts and documents is held by the US National Archives and Records Administration at the George Bush Presidential Library at College Station, Texas. The collection chronicles the disability and independent living movements by people with disabilities during the last half of the 20th century and the beginning of the 21st century..\n\n\n"}

{"id": "678924", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=678924", "title": "Match fixing", "text": "Match fixing\n\nIn organized sports, match fixing occurs as a match is played to a completely or partially pre-determined result, violating the rules of the game and often the law. The most common reason is to obtain a payoff from gamblers, but teams may also intentionally perform poorly to gain a future advantage, such as a better draft pick or, on paper, a less eminent opponent in a play-off. A player might also play poorly to rig a handicap system.\n\nMatch fixing, when motivated by gambling, requires contacts (and normally money transfers) between gamblers, players, team officials, and/or referees. These contacts and transfers can sometimes be found, and lead to prosecution by the law or the sports league(s). In contrast, losing for future advantage is internal to the team and very hard to prove. Often, substitutions made by the coach designed to deliberately increase the team's chances of losing (such as having key players sit out, using minimal or phantom injuries as an excuse), rather than ordering the players actually on the field to intentionally underperform, are cited as the main factor in cases where this has been alleged.\n\nMatch fixing generally refers to fixing the final result of the game. Another form of match fixing, known as spot fixing, involves fixing small events within a match which can be gambled upon, but which are unlikely to prove decisive in determining the final result of the game.\n\nOther names for match fixing include game fixing, race fixing, sports fixing, or hippodroming. Games that are deliberately lost are sometimes called thrown games. When a team intentionally loses a game, or does not score as high as it can, to obtain a perceived future competitive advantage, the team is often said to have tanked the game instead of having thrown it. In pool hustling, tanking is known as dumping. In sports where a handicap system exists and is capable of being abused, tanking is known as sandbagging.\n\nThe major motivations behind match fixing are gambling and future team advantage.\n\nThere may be financial gain through agreements with gamblers. The most infamous example of this in North America was the Black Sox Scandal of 1919, in which several members of the Chicago White Sox conspired with gamblers to fix the World Series.\n\nOne of the best-known examples of gambling-related race fixing (in motorsports) is the 1933 Tripoli Grand Prix, in which the winning number of the lottery was determined by the number of the race-winning car. One ticket holder held the number belonging to Achille Varzi, contacted him and agreed to share the winning should he win. Varzi contacted other drivers who agreed to share the money if they deliberately lost. Despite a poor start, Varzi won the race after his opponents deliberately underperformed throughout the race.\n\nAccording to Sportradar, a company that monitors the integrity of sports events on behalf of sports federations, as many as 1% of the matches they monitor are likely to be fixed.\n\nBy monitoring the pre-match betting markets it is possible to detect planned match fixing. It is also possible to detect on-going match manipulation by looking at the in-game betting markets. Several federations have employed services that provide such systems for detecting match manipulation. Prior to the 2016 MLB season, Major League Baseball (MLB) hired Genius Sports, a sports technology company specialising in integrity, to monitor the betting patterns on all of their games.\n\nIn addition, several federations run integrity tours where players and officials participate in educational workshops on how match fixing work and how they are prevented.\n\nMany sports have tournaments where the result of one round determines their opponent in the next round. As a result, by losing a match, a team can face an easier opponent in the next round, making them more likely to win. Although aligned with tanking, this action is generally viewed as acceptable in American sports.\n\nIn the National Basketball Association, there have also been allegations of teams tanking games to finish in sixth rather than fifth place in the conference standings, thus enabling the team in question to evade a possible playoff match with the conference's top seed until the final round of playoffs in that conference (for more details see single-elimination tournament). Additionally, the NBA is the only one of the four major professional sports leagues of the United States in which home advantage in the playoffs is based strictly on regular-season record without regard to seeding. This led to (unproven) allegations of late-season tanking by the 2005–06 Los Angeles Clippers in order to finish sixth instead of fifth in their conference; because of the league's playoff hosting rules, the Clippers would have home advantage in the 3–6 matchup but not the 4–5 matchup. Following that season, the NBA changed its playoff format so that the best second-place team in each conference would be able to obtain up to the #2 seed should it have the second-best conference record. The NBA has since changed its playoff format again, now awarding playoff berths to the top eight teams in each conference without regard to divisional alignment.\n\nOn occasion, a National Football League team has also been accused of throwing its final regular-season game in an attempt to \"choose\" its possible opponent in the subsequent playoffs.\n\nPerhaps the most notable example of this was when the San Francisco 49ers, who had clinched a playoff berth, lost their regular-season finale in 1988 to the Los Angeles Rams, thereby knocking the New York Giants (who had defeated the 49ers in the playoffs in both 1985 and 1986, also injuring 49er quarterback Joe Montana in the latter year's game) out of the postseason on tiebreakers; after the game, Giants quarterback Phil Simms angrily accused the 49ers of \"laying down like dogs.\"\n\nIn the Canadian Football League, since the introduction of the \"cross-over rule\" Western teams have been occasionally accused of tanking near the end of the season in situations where a loss would cause them to finish fourth place in their division and where such a finish was still good enough to secure a berth in the league's East Division playoffs. In recent years, the East has often been viewed to be a weaker division than the West; however, if any Western team has actually attempted such a strategy up to and included the 2014 season, it has not paid significant dividends for them since Western cross-over teams have only won one Eastern playoff game and have never advanced to the Grey Cup championship game from the Eastern bracket.\n\nA more recent example of possible tanking occurred in the ice hockey competition at the 2006 Winter Olympics. In Pool B, Sweden was to face Slovakia in the last pool match for both teams. Sweden coach Bengt-Åke Gustafsson publicly contemplated tanking against Slovakia, knowing that if his team won, their quarterfinal opponent would either be Canada, the 2002 gold medalists, or the Czech Republic, 1998 gold medalists. Gustafsson would tell Swedish television \"One is cholera, the other the plague.\" Sweden lost the match 3–0; the most obvious sign of tanking was when Sweden had a five-on-three powerplay with five NHL stars—Peter Forsberg, Mats Sundin, Daniel Alfredsson, Nicklas Lidström, and Fredrik Modin—on the ice, and failed to put a shot on goal. (\"Sports Illustrated\" writer Michael Farber would say about this particular powerplay, \"If the Swedes had passed the puck any more, their next opponent would have been the Washington Generals.\") If he was seeking to tank, Gustafsson got his wish; Sweden would face a much less formidable quarterfinal opponent in Switzerland. Canada would lose to Russia in a quarterfinal in the opposite bracket, while Sweden went on to win the gold medal, defeating the Czechs in the semifinals.\n\nThe 1998 Tiger Cup – an international football tournament contested by countries in Southeast Asia – saw an example of two teams trying to lose a match. The tournament was hosted by Vietnam and the eight countries competing were split into two groups of four. The top two in each group advanced to the semi-finals with the winners playing the runners-up of the other group. In the first group Singapore won the group with Vietnam finishing second. This meant that the winners of the second group would have to travel to Hanoi to play the host nation in the national stadium on their national day whilst the runners-up would face Singapore in Ho Chi Minh City where the final group match was taking place. As the two teams involved - Thailand and Indonesia - had both already qualified for the semi-finals it was in their interest to lose the match and finish in second place. As the game progressed neither side seemed particularly concerned with scoring whilst the defending was lackadaisical. As the match entered stoppage time the Indonesian defender Mursyid Effendi scored an own goal (overcoming the efforts of the opposition players to stop him). Both teams were fined $40,000 and Effendi was banned from international football for life.\n\nThe 2012 Summer Olympics saw at least two examples of actual or potential tanking of this type:\n\nIn February 2015, two girls' basketball teams representing Nashville-area Riverdale and Smyrna High Schools were found to be tanking a consolation match of their district tournament. The winner of the game would enter the same side of the regional tournament bracket as defending state champion Blackman High School (ranked as one of the country's top 10 teams by some national publications), setting up a potential match in the regional semifinals. The loser would avoid Blackman until the regional final, a game whose participants would both advance to the sectional tournament (one step short of the state tournament). During this game:\n\nThe Tennessee Secondary School Athletic Association, which governs high school sports in the state, took a very dim view of this escapade, banning both teams from further postseason play, fining the two schools a total of $1,500, and placing both teams on probation through the 2015–16 school year.\n\nOn the other hand, the practice of coaches on a playoff-bound team deliberately benching a team's best players for some or all of the final match(es) of the regular season is often defended as a common sense measure to avoid unnecessarily risking injuries and fatigue to the team's star players. Some argue that a coach not only should have the right but ought to select a starting lineup for a match that gives the team the best chance of winning titles in the long run, should this be a different lineup compared to the one that gives his team the best chance of winning the upcoming game. Of course, when coaches elect to do this, they are not necessarily deliberately trying to lose. For example, during Euro 2004 the Czech Republic rested nearly all of its starters from the first two group matches for the final group match against Germany. Since the Czechs had already clinched first place in the group, this move was seen to have the potential to allow Germany a better chance get the win they needed to advance at the expense of the winner of the Netherlands-Latvia game. As it happened, the Czechs' decision to field a \"weaker\" side did not matter since the Czechs won the match anyway to eliminate the Germans.\n\nMost top-level sports leagues in North America and Australia hold drafts to allocate young players to the league's teams. The order in which teams select players is often the inverse of their standings in the previous season. As a result, a team may have a significant incentive to tank games to secure a higher pick in the league's next draft, and a number of leagues have changed their draft rules to remove (or at least limit) potential incentives to tank.\n\nFrom 1966 to 1984, the NBA used a coin flip between the teams with the worst records in each of the league's two conferences to determine the recipient of the top pick. In the , several teams were accused of deliberately losing games in an attempt to gain a top position in the 1984 draft, which would eventually produce four Hall of Fame players. As a result of this, the NBA established a draft lottery in advance of the 1985 draft, involving all teams that did not make the playoffs in the previous season.\n\nEven though the current lottery gives the team with the worst record only a 25% chance at the top pick (with that team guaranteed no worse than the fourth pick), there can still be some incentive for a team to tank. In an interview for \"ESPN The Magazine\" before the , an NBA general manager who chose to remain anonymous (though speculated to be either Rob Hennigan of the Orlando Magic or Ryan McDonough of the Phoenix Suns) stated that because \"the last place you want to be is in the middle\", his team would try to tank that season to have the best chance at a top pick in the 2014 NBA draft, which was anticipated to be one of the deepest in recent league history. The GM explained how he got the team's owners and the coach to agree to it while trying to keep it a secret from the players. Responding to these perceived incentives, the NBA further tweaked its lottery rules shortly before the start of the 2017–18 season. Effective with the 2019 draft, the teams with the three worst records will have equal odds of landing the #1 pick (barring one of said teams also owning another lottery team's pick), and the top four picks will be allocated in the lottery instead of the top three.\n\nThe Australian Football League, the main competition of Australian rules football, has used a system of priority draft picks since 1993, with poorly performing teams receiving extra selections at or near the start of the draft. Prior to 2012, a team automatically received a priority pick if its win-loss record met pre-defined eligibility criteria. However, that system led to accusations of tanking by several clubs—most notably by Melbourne in 2009 (the club was found not guilty, but the head coach and general manager were found guilty on related charges). Since 2012, priority picks are awarded at the discretion of the AFL Commission, the governing body of both the AFL and the overall sport.\n\nUntil the 2014–15 NHL season, the National Hockey League assured the last place team of at least the second position in its entry draft, with the first overall pick being subject to a draft lottery among the five worst teams. As NHL drafts typically include only one NHL-ready prospect, if any at all, in any given year (most others must continue developing in junior ice hockey or the minor leagues for several years before reaching the NHL), this rudimentary lottery has historically been enough of a deterrent to avoid deliberate tanking. However, in 2014–15, two elite prospects widely considered to be “generational talents,” Connor McDavid and Jack Eichel, were projected to enter the 2015 NHL Entry Draft, thus ensuring the last place team at least one of the two prospects. This was most prominent with the Buffalo Sabres, whose fans openly rooted against their team in the hopes they would clinch last place in the league for much of the season (the Sabres themselves denied they were tanking and openly criticized their fans for suggesting the notion). Beginning in 2015–16, the top three picks in the draft will be subject to lottery, with all fourteen teams that did not qualify for the playoffs eligible to win the picks.\n\nNFL teams have been accused of tanking games to obtain a more favorable schedule the following season; this was especially true between 1977 and 1993, when a team finishing last in a five-team division would get to play four of its eight non-division matches the next season against other last-place teams.\n\nIn addition to the match fixing that is committed by players, coaches and/or team officials, it is not unheard of to have results manipulated by corrupt referees. Since 2004, separate scandals have erupted in prominent sports leagues in Portugal, Germany (Bundesliga scandal), Brazil (Brazilian football match-fixing scandal) and the United States (see Tim Donaghy scandal), all of which concerned referees who fixed matches for gamblers. Many sports writers have speculated that in leagues with high player salaries, it is far more likely for a referee to become corrupt since their pay in such competitions is usually much less than that of the players.\n\nOn December 2, 1896, former Old West lawman Wyatt Earp refereed the Fitzsimmons vs. Sharkey boxing match, promoted as the Heavyweight Championship of the World. Earp was chosen as referee by the National Athletic Association the afternoon of the match after both managers refused to agree on a choice. In the eighth round of a fight dominated by Fitzsimmons, Sharkey suddenly went down, clutching his groin, yelling foul. Referee Earp conferred with both corners for a few seconds before he disqualified Fitzsimmons for a foul that virtually no one saw. Fitzsimmons went to court to attempt to stop Shakey from taking the purse, but failed when the court ruled that the match was illegal and it had no jurisdiction.\n\nEight years later, Dr. B. Brookes Lee was arrested in Portland, Oregon. He had been accused of treating Sharkey to make it appear that he had been fouled by Fitzsimmons. Lee said, \"I fixed Sharkey up to look as if he had been fouled. How? Well, that is something I do not care to reveal, but I will assert that it was done—that is enough. There is no doubt that Fitzsimmons was entitled to the decision and did not foul Sharkey. I got $1,000 for my part in the affair.\"\n\nMatch fixing does not necessarily involve deliberately losing a match. Occasionally, teams have been accused of deliberately playing to a draw or a fixed score where this ensures some mutual benefit (e.g. both teams advancing to the next stage of a competition.) One of the earliest examples of this sort of match fixing in the modern era occurred in 1898 when Stoke City and Burnley intentionally drew in that year's final \"test match\" so as to ensure they were both in the First Division the next season. In response, the Football League expanded the divisions to 18 teams that year, thus permitting the intended victims of the fix (Newcastle United and Blackburn Rovers) to remain in the First Division. The \"test match\" system was abandoned and replaced with automatic relegation.\n\nA more recent example occurred in the 1982 FIFA World Cup, West Germany played Austria in the last match of group B. A West German victory by 1 or 2 goals would result in both teams advancing; any less and Germany was out; any more and Austria was out (and replaced by Algeria, who had just beaten Chile). West Germany attacked hard and scored after 10 minutes. Afterwards, the players then proceeded to just kick the ball around aimlessly for the remainder of the match. Algerian supporters were so angered that they waved banknotes at the players, while a German fan burned his German flag in disgust. By the second half, the ARD commentator refused any further comment on the game, while the Austrian television commentator advised viewers to switch off their sets. As a result, FIFA changed its tournament scheduling for subsequent World Cups so that the final pair of matches in each group are played simultaneously.\n\nAnother example took place on the next-to-last weekend of the 1992–93 Serie A season. Milan entered their match with Brescia needing only a point to secure the title ahead of crosstown rivals Inter, while Brescia believed a point would be enough for them to avoid relegation. In a 2004 retrospective on the \"dodgiest games\" in football history, two British journalists said about the match, \"For over 80 minutes, the two teams engaged in a shameful game of cat-and-mouse, in which the cat appeared to have fallen asleep and the mouse was on tranquilisers.\" Milan scored in the 82nd minute, but Brescia \"mysteriously found themselves with a huge overlap\" and equalised two minutes later. The 1–1 draw gave Milan their title, but in the end did not help Brescia; other results went against them and they suffered the drop.\n\nIn knockout competitions where the rules require drawn matches to be replayed, teams have sometimes been accused of intentionally playing one or more draws so as to ensure (a) replay(s). In this case, the motive is usually financial since the ensuing replay(s) would typically be expected to generate additional revenue for the participating teams. One notorious example of this particular type of alleged fix was the 1909 Scottish Cup Final, which sparked a riot after being played twice to a draw.\n\nIn addition to the aforementioned incidents of alleged fixing of drawn matches to ensure replays, mutual fixes have sometimes been alleged in \"best of X\" knockout series where draws are either not possible or very uncommon. Early versions of baseball's World Series were a common target of such allegations. Because the players received a percentage of the gate receipts for postseason games (a privilege they did not enjoy in the regular season), there was a perception that the players had an incentive to fix an equal number of early games in favor of each team so as to ensure the series would run the maximum number of games (or very close thereto). \n\nPartly as an effort to avoid this sort of controversy, early World Series sometimes saw all scheduled games played even if the Series winner was already determined. That did not prove satisfactory since few fans were willing to pay to watch lame duck contests. Eventually, following the controversy at the \nconclusion of the 1904 season in which the New York Giants boycotted the World Series in part because of dissatisfaction with the financial arrangements surrounding the Series, Major League Baseball agreed to a number of reforms proposed by Giants owner John T. Brush. Among other things, the so-called \"Brush Rules\" stipulated that the players would only receive a share of ticket revenue from the first four games, thus eliminating any financial incentive for the players to deliberately prolong the World Series.\n\nOn several occasions, \"creative\" use of tie-breaking rules have allegedly led teams to play less than their best.\n\nAn example occurred in the 2004 European Football Championship. Unlike FIFA, UEFA takes the result of the game between the two tied teams (or in a three-way tie, the overall records of the games played with the teams in question only) into consideration before overall goal difference when ranking teams level on points, a situation arose in Group C where Sweden and Denmark played to a 2–2 draw, which was a sufficiently high scoreline to eliminate Italy (which had lower-scoring draws with the Swedes and Danes) regardless of Italy's result with already-eliminated Bulgaria. Although Italy beat Bulgaria by only one goal to finish level with Sweden and Denmark on five points, and would hypothetically have been eliminated using the FIFA tie-breaker too, some Italian fans bitterly contended that the FIFA tie-breaker would have motivated their team to play harder and deterred their Scandinavian rivals from, in their view, at the very least half-heartedly playing out the match after the score became 2–2. The same situation happened to Italy in 2012, leading to many pre-game complaints from Italy, who many commentators suggested were right to be concerned because of their own extensive experience in this area. But Spain-Croatia ended up 1–0, and the Italians went through.\n\nThe FIFA tie-breaker, or any goal-differential scheme, can cause problems, too. There have been incidents (especially in basketball) where players on a favored team have won the game but deliberately ensured the quoted point spread was not covered (see point shaving). Conversely, there are cases where a team not only lost (which might be honest) but lost by some large amount, perhaps to ensure a point spread was covered, or to grant some non-gambling related favor to the victor. Perhaps the most famous alleged example was the match between Argentina and Peru in the 1978 FIFA World Cup. Argentina needed a four-goal victory to advance over Brazil, an enormous margin at this level of competition, especially since Argentina had a weak offense (6 goals in 5 games) and Peru a stout defence (6 goals allowed in 5 games). Yet somehow, Argentina won 6–0. Much was made over political collusion, that the Peruvian goalkeeper was born in Argentina, and that Peru was dependent on Argentinian grain shipments, but nothing was ever proven.\n\nAlthough the Denmark–Sweden game above led to calls for UEFA to adopt FIFA's tiebreaking formula for future tournaments, it is not clear if this solves the problem; the Argentina-Peru game shows a possible abuse of the FIFA tie-breaker. Proponents of the UEFA tie-breaker argue that it reduces the value of \"blow-outs\", whether these be the result of a much stronger team \"running up the score\" or an already-eliminated side allowing an unusually large number of goals. Perhaps the most infamous incident occurred in December 1983 when Spain, needing to win by eleven goals to qualify for the Euro 1984 ahead of the Netherlands, defeated Malta by a score of 12–1 on the strength of \"nine\" second half goals. Especially in international football, such lopsided results are seen as unsavoury, even if they are honest. If anything, these incidents serves as evidence that the FIFA tie-breaker can cause incentives to perpetrate a fix in some circumstances, the UEFA tie-breaker in others.\n\nTie-breaking rules played the central role in one of cricket's more notorious matches. In a 1979 match in England's now-defunct Benson & Hedges Cup, a one-day league, Worcestershire hosted Somerset in the final group match for both sides. Going into that match, Somerset led their group with three wins from three matches, but would end in a three-way tie for the top spot if they lost to Worcestershire and Glamorgan defeated the then-winless Minor Counties South. In that event, the tie-breaker would be bowling strike rate. The Somerset players calculated that a large enough loss could see them miss the quarter-finals. Accordingly, Somerset captain Brian Rose determined that if Somerset batted first and declared their innings closed after one over, they would protect their strike rate advantage, assuring advancement to the quarter-finals. When Somerset won the toss, Rose implemented the plan, batting in the first partnership and declaring at the close of the first over after Somerset scored only one run on a no-ball. Worcestershire won during their second over. Rose's strategy, although not against the letter of the rules, was condemned by media and cricket officials, and the Test and County Cricket Board (predecessor to the current England and Wales Cricket Board) voted to expel Somerset from that season's competition.\n\nA player can concede with the understanding that the opponent will share the prize equally with him or her. Depending on the game, this can lead to disqualification.\n\nOn occasion, teams tank games as a protest against actions in earlier games. The most lopsided professional football match in history, AS Adema 149–0 SO l'Emyrne, was a result of SO l'Emyrne intentionally losing the game in protest against the referee's action in a previous game.\n\nBookmakers in the early 21st century accept bets on a far wider range of sports-related propositions than ever before. Thus, a gambling-motivated fix might not necessarily involve any direct attempt to influence the outright result, especially in team sports where such a fix would require the co-operation (and prerequsitely, the knowledge) of many people, and/or perhaps would be more likely to arouse suspicion. Fixing the result of a more particular proposition might be seen as less likely to be noticed. For example, disgraced former National Basketball Association referee Tim Donaghy has been alleged to have perpetrated some of his fixes by calling games in such a manner as to ensure more points than expected were scored by both teams, thus affecting \"over-under\" bets on the games whilst also ensuring that Donaghy at least did not look to be outright biased. Also, bets are increasingly being taken on individual performances in team sporting events, which in turn has seen the rise of a phenomenon known as spot fixing, although it is currently unlikely that enough is bet on an average player to allow someone to place a substantial wager on them without being noticed.\n\nOne such attempt was described by retired footballer Matthew Le Tissier, who in 2009 admitted that while he was playing with Southampton FC back in 1995 he tried (and failed) to kick the ball out of play right after the kick-off of a Premier League match against Wimbledon FC so that a group of associates would collect on a wager made on an early throw-in.\n\nSimilarly, in 2010, Pakistani cricket players were accused of committing specific no-ball penalties for the benefit of gamblers. This scandal centred on three Pakistani players accepting bribes from a bookmaker, Mazhar Majeed during the Lord's test match against England. Following investigations by the News of the World and Scotland Yard, on 1 November 2011, Majeed, Pakistan's captain, Salman Butt, Mohammad Asif and Mohammad Amir were found guilty of conspiracy to cheat at gambling and to accept corrupt payments.\n\nAs a result, all three of the players were banned by the International Cricket Council (ICC); Butt for ten years, Asif for seven and Amir for five. On 3 November 2011, jail terms were handed down of 30 months for Butt, one year for Asif, six months for Amir and two years eight months for Majeed.\n\nWhenever any serious motivation for teams to manipulate results becomes apparent to the general public, there can be a corresponding effect on betting markets as honest gamblers speculate in good faith as to the chance such a fix might be attempted. Some bettors might choose to avoid wagering on such a fixture while others will be motivated to wager on it, or alter the bet they would otherwise place. Such actions will invariably affect odds and point spreads even if there is no contact whatsoever between teams and the relevant gambling interests. The rise of betting exchanges has allowed such speculation to play out in real time.\n\nSince gambling pre-dates recorded history it comes as little surprise that evidence of match fixing is found throughout recorded history. The ancient Olympic Games were almost constantly dealing with allegations of athletes accepting bribes to lose a competition and city-states which often tried to manipulate the outcome with large amounts of money. These activities went on despite the oath each athlete took to protect the integrity of the events and the severe punishment sometimes inflicted on those who were caught. Chariot racing was also dogged by race fixing throughout its history.\n\nBy the end of the 19th century gambling was illegal in most jurisdictions, but that did not stop its widespread practice. Boxing soon became rife with fighters \"taking a dive\", likely due to boxing being a sport involving individual competitors, which makes its matches much easier to fix without getting caught. Baseball also became plagued by match fixing despite efforts by the National League to stop gambling at its games. Matters finally came to a head in 1919 when eight members of the Chicago White Sox threw the World Series (see Black Sox Scandal). In an effort to restore confidence, Major League Baseball established the office of the Commissioner of Baseball, and one of Kenesaw Mountain Landis's first acts was to ban all involved players for life.\n\nMLB Rule 21 prohibits players from participating in any form of betting on baseball games, and a lifetime ban on betting on a player's own games. A poster with Rule 21 must be posted on all professional baseball clubhouses.\n\n is a Japanese word meaning a cheating activity which is committed at places where a match, fight, game, competition, or other contest, is held, where the winner and loser are decided in advance by agreement of the competitors or related people. It is believed that the word \"Yaocho\" came from the name (\"Chobei\") of the owner of a vegetable stand (\"yaoya\") during the Meiji period. Created from the first syllable of \"Yaoya\" and \"chobei\", the word \"yaocho\" was created for a nickname of Chobei. Chobei had a friend called \"Isenoumi Godayu\" (7th Isenoumi stablemaster) with whom he played the game Igo, who had once been a sumo wrestler \"Kashiwado Sogoro\" (former \"shikona\": \"Kyonosato\") and now was a \"toshiyori\" (a stablemaster of sumo). Although Chobei was a better Igo player than Isenoumi, he sometimes lost games on purpose to please Isenoumi, so that Isenoumi would continue to buy merchandise from his shop. Afterward, once people knew of his cheating, they started to use \"yaocho\" as a word meaning any decision to win/lose a match in advance by negotiation etc. with the expectation of secondary profit, even though the match seems to be held seriously and fairly.\n\nEconomists, using statistical analysis, have shown very strong evidence of bout fixing in sumo wrestling. Most of the motive for match fixing is helping each other's ranking to keep their salary higher, according to Keisuke Itai. For example, wrestlers in \"jūryō\" (the second tier) desperately try to avoid finishing the tournament with a losing record (7–8 or worse) and exchange or buy the match result otherwise their salary would be nothing, literally 0 yen, with the participation wage of 150,000 yen every two months if they finish the tournament with a losing record, and their ranking would go down to \"makushita\" (third level) and only participate in seven matches, the lesser ranking from \"jūryō\" in which one can earn 1,036,000 yen monthly with some prizes and a full 15-match tournament.\n\nThe sumo association appears to make a distinction between \"yaocho\" (the payment of money to secure a result) and \"koi-ni-yatta mukiryoku zumo\" (the deliberate performance of underpowered sumo, whereby an opponent simply lays a match down without exchange of money). The intricacies of Japanese culture, which include subordination of individual gain to the greater good, and knowing how to read a situation without the exchange of words (i.e. I know my opponent's score, he needs help and I should automatically give it to him), mean that the latter is almost readily accepted in the sumo world, and is also nigh-impossible to prove.\n\nIn professional wrestling, most matches have predetermined results; however, as it is an open secret that professional wrestling is staged, it is not considered match fixing.\n\nUp until the 1920s, professional wrestling was a legitimate sport. This did not endure as professional wrestling became identified with modern theatrics or \"admitted fakery\" (\"kayfabe\"), moving away from actual competition. The worked nature of the art have made critics consider it an illegitimate sport, particularly in comparison to boxing, amateur wrestling, and, in more recent times, mixed martial arts.\n\nMany individuals began to doubt the legitimacy of wrestling after the retirement of Frank Gotch in 1913. As wrestling's popularity was diving around the same time that Major League Baseball had its own legitimacy issues, wrestling started to take on a more worked approach while still appearing as a legitimate sport, beginning with the Gold Dust Trio of the 1920s. Even after the formation of the National Wrestling Alliance in 1948, wrestling continued to have legitimacy issues.\n\nNevertheless, wrestling was still regulated by state athletic commissions in the United States well into the 1980s, until Vince McMahon, owner of the World Wrestling Federation, convinced the state of New Jersey in 1989 that wrestling was considered a form of entertainment (or sports entertainment, as McMahon used) rather than as a legitimate sport, and that it should not be regulated by state athletic commissions. The move was seen as more of a relief to those who had questioned wrestling's legitimacy, since at least one major company (in this case, the WWF) was now publicly willing to admit that wrestling was staged; however, the move did anger many wrestling purists.\n\nToday, despite the staged aspects of wrestling, it is still seen as a legitimate sport in several countries, such as Canada, Japan, Mexico, and the United Kingdom, while it is seen as a form of entertainment in the United States similar to that of the Harlem Globetrotters. Due to the lingering legitimacy issues that surrounded wrestling from the 1910s until the 1980s, gambling was generally not allowed on wrestling matches while it was still considered a legitimate sport. Despite wrestling having openly acknowledged that the results are predetermined for years, since the late 2000s gambling has increased on wrestling events, though the maximum bets are kept low due to the matches being predetermined.\n\nIn the 1950's, televised quiz shows in the United States became the center of a match fixing controversy. At the time, the majority of television programs were effectively controlled by their single sponsors, with broadcasters only providing studios and airtime. \n\nGeritol—the sponsor of the new quiz show \"Twenty-One\"—was unimpressed by the program, which also struggled in the ratings in comparison to \"The $64,000 Question\". The company demanded that its producer, Barry & Enright Productions, make changes to \"Twenty-One\" to boost viewer interest and ratings. A decision was made to replace the show's current champion, Herbert Stempel, in favor of Charles Van Doren—a Columbia University English teacher whom the producers felt would be a more popular contestant—by instructing Stempel to lose his match to his new opponent. In an effort to build hype for the episode where Van Doren would win, the first episode of their match was played to three tie games. Winners of matches received $500 for every point within their margin of victory, but this increased by $500 after every tie game; promotion for the next episode on December 5, 1956 duly-noted that the contestants would be playing for $2,000 per-point. \n\nIn the ensuing episode, after one more tie game, Stempel threw the match to Van Doren as planned. Among the questions Stempel was specifically instructed to answer incorrectly, he guessed tthat \"On the Waterfront\" was the winner of Best Picture at the 28th Academy Awards. The correct answer was \"Marty\", which was also one of Stempel's favorite films. The cancellation of another quiz show, \"Dotto\", under allegations of rigging, prompted a U.S. government investigation into both shows. The investigation had similarly revealed that Revlon—the sponsor of \"The $64,000 Question\"—had instructed the show's producers to balance the game more favorably towards contestants they felt would be more popular among viewers. The scandal resulted in regulations being implemented to prohibit the rigging of game shows and other contests by broadcasters.\n"}

The measures undertaken by the authorities, such as creation of forced quarantines, destruction of contaminated property without compensation or control, closing of public baths, etc., caused fear and anger among the citizens. The city's economy was mostly paralyzed because many factories, markets, stores, and administrative buildings had been closed down. All of this was followed by acute food shortages, causing deterioration of living conditions for the majority of the Muscovites. Dvoryane (Russian nobility) and well-off city dwellers left Moscow due to the plague outbreak.\n\nThe first outbursts of mass protest against the measures undertaken by the authorities took place on August 29 and September 1 in a neighborhood of Lefortovo. By early September, the rumors of an imminent uprising had already been circulating. An attempt by the Archbishop Ambrosius of Moscow to prevent the citizens from gathering at the Icon of the Virgin Mary of Bogolyubovo () in Kitai-gorod as a quarantine measure served as an immediate cause for the Plague Riot. On September 15, huge crowds of Muscovites began to flow towards the Red Square at the sound of the alarm bell. Pushing aside a military unit, they burst into the Kremlin and destroyed the Chudov Monastery (archbishop's residence) and its wine cellars. Archbishop Ambrosius managed to escape to the Donskoy Monastery. \n\nOn September 16, the riot gained in strength. Angry citizens captured the Donskoy Monastery, killed Archbishop Ambrosius, and destroyed two quarantine zones (Danilov Monastery and the one beyond the Serpukhov Gates). In the afternoon, most of the rebels approached the Kremlin and were met by a number of military units. The crowd demanded the surrender of Lieutenant General Pyotr Yeropkin, who had been overseeing the affairs of Moscow after Pyotr Saltykov's departure. As soon as the Muscovites tried to attack the Kremlin's Spasskiye Gates, the army opened fire with buckshot, dispersing the crowd and capturing some of the rebels. \nOn the morning of September 17, around 1000 people gathered at the Spasskiye gates again, demanding the release of captured rebels and elimination of quarantines. The army managed to disperse the crowd yet again and finally suppressed the riot. Some 300 people were brought to trial. A government commission headed by Grigory Orlov was sent to Moscow on September 26 to restore order. It took some measures against the plague and provided citizens with work and food, which would finally pacify the people of Moscow. The commission improved services in quarantines, put an end to the burning of property, reopened public baths, permitted trade, increased food deliveries, and organized public works. At the same time, the commission was engaged in prosecuting those who had taken part in the Plague Riot. Four of them were executed; 165 adults and twelve teenagers were subjected to punishment. With the onset of cold weather, the outbreak began to subside. Around 200,000 people died in Moscow and its outskirts during the plague.\n\nThere was another unlikely convict—the church bell that was used to start the alarm. By the order of Catherine II, an executor cut the \"tang\" from the bell. For more than thirty years, the silent bell hung on the bell tower. Eventually, in 1803, it was removed and sent to the Arsenal and, in 1821, to the Kremlin Armoury.\n\n"}

In domestic animals, myopia, with or without astigmatism, occurs frequently.\n\nWhereas the rhinoceros may suffer from less-than-adequate eyesight, it generally survives by concentrating with its superior hearing and sense of smell. Some reports, however state that it can see better when focusing with one eye, particularly when walking, posturing, and combatting.\n\nMyopia, with or without astigmatism, is the most common eye condition in horses.\nSeveral types of occlusion myopia have been recorded in tree shrews, macaques, cats and rats, deciphered from several animal-inducing myopia models. Preliminary laboratory investigations using retinoscopy of 240 dogs found myopic problems with varying degrees of refraction errors depending on the breed. In cases involving German Shepherds, Rottweilers and Miniature horses, the refraction errors were indicative of myopia. Nuclear sclerosis of the crystalline lens was noticed in older dogs.\n\nExperiments into newborn macaque monkeys have revealed that surgically fusing the eyelid for one year results in eye deterioration as the eye has not had a chance to grow and develop. Keeping monkeys in the dark for a similar period, however, does not lead to myopia. In 1996, Maurice and Mushin conducted tests on rabbits by raising their body temperatures and intraocular pressures (IOP) and noted that while younger rabbits were prone to developing myopia, older rabbits were not. Some tests have revealed that myopia in some animals can be improved with eye drops containing zinc, by increasing the activity of superoxide dismutase (SOD).\n\nThe rhesus monkey's vision amplitude reduction is noticeable in its second decade of life; however the condition does not impede normal functioning. Older rhesus monkeys have more difficulty accommodating this reduction in vision amplitude, encountering difficulty in focussing on objects at close range, even objects on the ground within an arm's length.\n\nIn Central Park Zoo, New York, several myopic animals have been reported, including a 39-year-old elephant, a Cape buffalo, and some monkeys. Young elephants and other animals are said to be myopia free. Pet dogs with progressive myopia have been reported.\n"}

{"id": "9670604", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=9670604", "title": "Nutritionism", "text": "Nutritionism\n\nNutritionism is a paradigm that assumes that it is the scientifically identified nutrients in foods that determine the value of individual food stuffs in the diet. In other words, it is the idea that the nutritional value of a food is the sum of all its individual nutrients, vitamins, and other components. Another aspect of the term is the implication that the only point of eating is to promote bodily health. The term is largely pejorative, implying that this way of viewing food is simplistic and harmful, and the term is usually used to label others' views. The concept's most prominent opponent, and popularizer of the term, journalist Michael Pollan, argues that a food's nutritional value is \"more than the sum of its parts.\"\n\nOriginally credited to Gyorgy Scrinis, the notion was popularized by Michael Pollan. The key to Pollan's understanding of nutritionism is \"the widely shared but unexamined assumption ... that the key to understanding food is indeed the nutrient.\" Since nutrients are invisible, it is now necessary to rely on nutrition experts to make food choices. Because science has an incomplete understanding of how food affects the human body, Pollan argues, relying solely on information regarding individual nutrients has led people and policy makers to repeatedly make poor decisions relating to nutrition. Pollan blames nutritionism for many of the health problems relating to diet in the Western World today. He compares Nutritionism to a religion, relying on \"priests\" (nutritional scientists and journalists) to interpret the latest orthodoxy for the masses. Like many religions, nutritionism has divided the world into good and evil components, although what is good or evil can change dramatically with time. Pollan believes that nutritionism is inherently flawed due to a reductive bias within science to isolate and study individual factors disconnected from their usual contexts such as diet and culture, factors which have repeatedly been shown to have a fundamental impact on nutritional outcomes. Even when scientists have attempted to study factors such as culture, diet, and long term consumption patterns, the enormous difficulties in making accurate measurements relating to individual nutritional components, and producing meaningful conclusions has resulted in incomplete results at best, and misleading or harmful results at worst.\n\nBen Goldacre wrote that nutritionism, or its attribution to scientists, is the \"bollocks du jour\", and that it is \"driven by a set of first year undergraduate errors in interpreting scientific data.\" In his opinion, professional researchers and medical experts bear some blame for nutritionism because they at times created unrealistic expectations about the potential benefits of their research, but that the primary promoters of nutritionism are health food manufacturers, self-proclaimed \"gurus\" and journalists who have an incomplete understanding of science, along with a credulous public that is willing to believe whatever simplistic theories they are told in the mass media.\n\nAt least one observer, Daniel Engber has argued that Pollan's anti-nutritionism, or anti-food science stance has taken on a dogmatic tint itself. He says, \"Modern nutrition may be more of an ideology than a science, but so is Pollan's nutritional Darwinism. The two ideologies stand in direct opposition to one another, with the science-minded progressives on one side and the culinary conservatives on the other.\" One criticism is that while many scientific studies of nutrition, or the conclusions extrapolated from them by both scientists and journalists have been bad, we should not reject a scientific approach to food altogether. One reviewer notes that the study of vitamins and nutrients led to vast improvement in treatment of diseases such as beriberi or scurvy and that with further refinement food science may well help combat other diseases and health conditions. The complexity of food science should not be taken as a reason to abandon systematic investigation of it. Daniel Engber also argues that Pollan over idealizes the diet of our ancestors, and believes that it may not be well suited to our modern needs.\n\n"}

{"id": "18640324", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=18640324", "title": "Obesity paradox", "text": "Obesity paradox\n\nThe obesity paradox is a medical hypothesis which holds that obesity (and high cholesterol, when the more global term reverse epidemiology is used) may, counterintuitively, be protective and associated with greater survival in certain groups of people, such as very elderly individuals or those with certain chronic diseases. It further postulates that normal to low body mass index or normal values of cholesterol may be detrimental and associated with higher mortality in asymptomatic people.\n\nThe terminology reverse epidemiology was first proposed by Kamyar Kalantar-Zadeh in the journal \"Kidney International\" in 2003 and in the \"Journal of the American College of Cardiology\" in 2004. It is a contradiction to prevailing concepts of prevention of atherosclerosis and cardiovascular disease; however, active prophylactic treatment of heart disease in otherwise healthy, asymptomatic people is and has been controversial in the medical community for several years.\n\nThe mechanism responsible for this reversed association is unknown, but it has been suggested that, in chronic kidney disease patients, \"The common occurrence of persistent inflammation and protein energy wasting in advanced CKD [chronic kidney disease] seems to a large extent to account for this paradoxical association between traditional risk factors and CV outcomes in this patient population.\" Other research has proposed that the paradox may be explained by adipose tissue storing lipophilic chemicals that would otherwise be toxic to the body.\n\nThe obesity paradox (excluding cholesterol paradox) was first described in 1999 in overweight and obese people undergoing hemodialysis, and has subsequently been found in those with heart failure, myocardial infarction, acute coronary syndrome, older nursing home residents, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD).\n\nIn people with heart failure, those with a body mass index between 30.0–34.9 had lower mortality than those with what would normally be considered an ideal weight. This has been attributed to the fact that people often lose weight as they become progressively more ill. Similar findings have been made in other types of heart disease. People with class I obesity and heart disease do not have greater rates of further heart problems than people of normal weight who also have heart disease. In people with greater degrees of obesity, however, risk of further events is increased. Even after cardiac bypass surgery, no increase in mortality is seen in the overweight and obese. One study found that the improved survival could be explained by the more aggressive treatment obese people receive after a cardiac event. Another found that if one takes into account COPD in those with peripheral artery disease, the benefit of obesity no longer exists.\n\nThe obesity paradox has been criticized on the grounds of being an artifact arising from biases in observational studies. Strong confounding by smoking has been noted by several researchers. Since smokers, who are subject to higher mortality rates, also tend to be leaner, inadequate adjustment for smoking would lead to underestimations of the risk ratios associated with the overweight and obese categories of BMI. In an analysis of 1.46 million individuals, restriction to never-smoking participants greatly reduced the mortality estimates in the underweight group, as well as strengthening the estimates in the overweight and obese groups. A similar 2016 study found that a low BMI that has been \"induced by healthy lifestyles\" is the best method of reducing the risk of premature death.\n\nAnother concern is reverse causation due to illness-induced weight loss. That is, it may not be low BMI that is causing death (and thereby making obesity seem protective) but rather imminent death causing low BMI. Indeed, unintentional weight loss is an extremely significant predictor of mortality. Sick individuals often undergo weight loss before death, and classifying those individuals as lean greatly inflates the mortality rate in the normal and underweight categories of BMI, while lowering the risk in the higher BMI categories. Studies that employ strategies to reduce reverse causation such as excluding sick individuals at baseline and introducing time lag to exclude deaths at the beginning of follow-up have yielded estimates of increased risk for body mass indices above 25 kg/m. Critics of the \"paradox\" have also argued that studies supporting its existence almost always use BMI as the only measure of obesity. However, because BMI is an imperfect method of measuring obesity, critics argue that studies using other measures of obesity in addition to BMI, such as waist circumference and waist to hip ratio, render the existence of the \"paradox\" questionable. \n\nOne probable methodological explanation for the obesity paradox is collider stratification bias, which commonly emerges when one restricts or stratifies on a factor (the 'collider') that is caused by both the exposure (or its descendents) and the outcome (or its ancestors/risk factors). To put it in the context of the obesity paradox, the exposure is the obesity measurement (e.g., BMI), the outcome is mortality, and the collider is one of certain chronic diseases ( take CVD as an example). First let's assume that obesity does not cause post-CVD death (i.e., no effect) and see how the bias arises. Among CVD patients, those with low BMI must have some other risk factors (e.g., smoking) to make CVD occurred; whereas those without major risk factors other than obesity (e.g., smoking) are more likely to have higher BMI since it's the only left known major risk factors for CVD. Let's further assume that these other major risk factors for CVD are also risk factors for post-CVD death (which is more often the case). We would come to the finding that those with lower BMI (normal weight group) but developed CVD are more likely to die because they tend to have other risk factors for both CVD and death, and those CVD cases with higher BMI (obesity group) are less likely to die due to a relative lack of these risk factors. Thus restricting to CVD patients yields a 'protective effect' of obesity against post-CVD death even if there is no effect to begin with. The spurious protective effect of obesity can be huge enough to reverse a detrimental effect when the selection proportion (CVD cases among the source population) becomes small.\n\n\n"}

At the pharmacy, a pharmacist oversees the fulfillment of medical prescriptions and is available to give advice on their offerings of over-the-counter drugs. A typical pharmacy would be in the commercial area of a community. \n\nThe American Association of Colleges of Pharmacy recommends that consumers choose a pharmacy at which they can have a consulting relationship with the pharmacist. Anyone using drugs benefits when they have easier access to a pharmacist Being timely includes both processing the request quickly and having drug stock available to fill the prescription. Some consumers need drugs delivered to their home, perhaps by mail, and may select a pharmacy which offers that service. Different pharmacies may charge different prices for the same drugs, so shopping for lower prices may identify a pharmacy offering better value. In addition to fulfilling prescriptions, a pharmacy might offer preventive healthcare services like vaccinations. Up-to-date technology at a pharmacy can assist a patient with prescription reminders and alerts about potential negative drug interactions, thereby reducing medical errors.\n\nThe International Pharmaceutical Federation has declared their vision of a community-based pharmacist:\n\n\nCommunity-based pharmacists' responsibilities include: checking and dispensing of prescription drugs, providing advice on drug selection and usage to doctors and other health professionals and counseling patients in health promotion, disease prevention and the proper use of medicines.\n\nIn most countries regulations govern how dispensaries may operate, with specific requirements for storage conditions, equipment and record keeping.\n\nIt is becoming more common for pharmacists to take on extended roles that provide more clinical care directly to patients as part of a primary care team. There are around 11,400 community pharmacies in England. Many are open for extended hours in the evenings and weekends and they are accessible without appointment.\n\nIn the English NHS there are 438 million visits nationally to community pharmacies a year for health related reasons. More than 1 billion prescription items were dispensed in 2012. More than £14 billion is spent on prescribed drugs annually. Under the 2005 NHS Community Pharmacy contract all community pharmacists in England and Wales provide:\n\nWidely available Advanced Services:\n\n\nEnhanced Services which are not available unless locally commissioned:\n\nTo help pharmacists be able to take on extended roles, it is common for them to work as part of a team that can include pharmacy technicians, dispensing assistants and counter assistants.\n\nIn parts of mainland Europe, the pharmacist is required to own the pharmacy of which she or he is the licensee. Under this arrangement, a pharmacist can be the operator of only a single outlet. In the UK, 60% of all community pharmacies are owned by companies that own multiple pharmacies.\n\nIn the United States, more than 25% of independent owners have ownership in two or more pharmacies.\n\nMost of New Zealand's community pharmacies are owner-operated. In Australia, pharmacists recognise the need to integrate professional pharmacy services into the health system to meet the changing health care needs of the population.\n\nA survey conducted by PrescribeWellness found that almost half of Americans older than 40 years-old value pharmacies that offer preventative care services, and would be willing to transfer their prescriptions to pharmacies that offer those services. Patients also value pharmacies where they can receive medical advice concerning their prescription medications, how those medications may interact with each other, and receive over-the-counter drug recommendations for the management of common ailments. In a survey of over 1,000 U.S. adults older than 40 years-old conducted by Propeller Insights, 67% of patients responded that they would prefer that their pharmacist discuss new prescriptions with them, rather than their physician, because they viewed their pharmacist as \"better at explaining side effects and has more time to spend with them.\"\n\n"}

{"id": "47388601", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=47388601", "title": "Seales v Attorney-General", "text": "Seales v Attorney-General\n\nSeales v Attorney-General [2015] NZHC 1239 was a 2015 court case concerned with whether a doctor could assist a terminally ill patient in ending her own life. Wellington lawyer Lecretia Seales, terminally ill from a brain tumour, sought High Court declarations to the effect that her doctor would not be committing murder, manslaughter or assisting a suicide if he assisted in her euthanasia. Seales also sought, as an alternative, that the court make declarations that the Crimes Act was not consistent with the New Zealand Bill of Rights Act 1990. The Court declined to make any of the declarations sought by Seales. Seales died of her illness the day after the judgment was delivered.\n\nIn 2011 Seales was diagnosed with a brain tumour. She received brain surgery, chemotherapy and radio therapy but her condition continued to deteriorate. In 2015 she put a case to the High Court to challenge New Zealand law for her right to die with the assistance of her GP, asking for a declaration that her GP would not risk conviction.\n\nThe statutory background to the decision is the Crimes Act 1961 and its prohibitions on: homicide (section 160); aiding and abetting suicide (section 179(b)); consenting to death (section 63); and acceleration of death (section 164). In New Zealand these are the legal barriers to euthanasia.\n\nSeales's application relied on giving the word suicide an alternative meaning to the ordinary dictionary definition, as required by section 6 of the New Zealand Bill of Rights Act 1990. Accordingly, during the hearing, \"Mr Curran, who appeared with Dr Butler as counsel for Ms Seales, submitted s 63 of the Crimes Act should be construed so as not to preclude consent as a defence to either murder or manslaughter where the deceased has lawfully asserted his or her NZBORA rights.\"\n\nThis legal argument was summarised in a law journal article prior to the hearing; \n\nSeales sought two declarations regarding criminal law, and two declarations of inconsistency between the Crimes Act and the NZBoRA:\n\nThe declarations of inconsistency that Seales sought were that:\n\nThese sections in the Crimes Act 1961, as mentioned, set out its prohibitions on homicide (section 160) and aiding and abetting suicide (section 179(b)). These work to effectively block any physician-assisted suicide or act of euthanasia by illegalizing any acts that kill a person, assist in their suicide or accelerate their death. Section 8 of the NZBORA is the right not to be deprived of life, and section 9 contains the right not to be subjected to torture or cruel treatment.\n\nThese declarations sought by Seales were to the effect of allowing her to commit physician-assisted suicide. The declarations sought with regards to the New Zealand Bill of Rights Act (NZBoRA) were inspired by the similar Canadian case of \"Carter v Canada\", and the crippling condition that Seales found herself suffering from. Sections 160 and 179 provide a barrier to physician-assisted suicide in New Zealand which closely resembled that of pre-Carter Canada.\n\nHer reasoning was twofold: First, that she was under the constant worry that her inevitable and impending death would be slow, unpleasant, painful or undignified. She saw this as contrary to the way in which she lived her life, and she did not wish to be put through this. Secondly, she worried that this would put her in a position where she felt compelled to take her own life prior to the point that she would desire.\n\nJustice Collins set out a number of reasons why he would not grant these declarations, but he also acknowledged a number of things that Seales and her counsel were putting forward that were both accurate and persuasive. It was accepted that a change in the law could lead to a reduction in the number of suicides that take place in New Zealand. New Zealand currently has a very high suicide rate when compared to other developed countries, and taking a step in the direction of legalisation in favour of physician-assisted suicide could potentially help reduce this. This would act twofold, both by giving a more controlled and monitored way of ending a life, but also to reduce the number of people who take their own lives after the realization that they may end up in a position like Seales, with an impending loss of autonomy and dignity.\n\nHe explained in the affidavit of Dr Reagan in this case that in his experience the option for aid in dying was beneficial for both patients and families of those suffering. The option of having this process available for someone in a situation where a painful death is inevitable is said to help patients feel like there is a retention of some form of autonomy or control over their lives, while allowing them to live life with their families rather than feeling as though they are forced to take it prematurely so as to avoid possible suffering in the future. This right to autonomy and dignity is one that is fundamental to human rights, and a basic principle of many jurisdictions and has been highlighted as a fundamental right in the European Court of Human Rights.\n\nDespite this, Collins J declined to grant any of the declarations sought. \nJustice Collins noted a potential problem with adopting an alternative meaning of suicide was in giving effect to section 41 of the Crimes Act, which allows force to be used to prevent a suicide; \"It is difficult to see how a person who intervenes to prevent a suicide can assess whether or not he or she is intervening in a case of “rational” suicide.\" Collins also noted the Canadian Supreme Court in \"Carter v Canada (AG)\" had given near identical provisions of Canadian criminal law prohibiting euthanasia the same meaning and that there was authority from the United Kingdom endorsing his interpretation of section 179(b) of the Crimes Act.\n\nThe right to life, or not to be deprived of life, is one of the most fundamental rights as per Blackstone. The differences between the Canadian charter and the NZBoRA begin to show here, as the relevant section of the Canadian Charter, section 7, is broader than section 8 of the NZBoRA. This led to a determination that in the interaction between the Canadian Charter and the Canadian Crimes Act, there was the ability for a competent adult to consent to the termination of their life, so long as they are under the influence of a grievous and irremediable medical condition that causes intolerable and enduring suffering. In New Zealand it was to be discussed in this case, using the aforementioned reasoning, as to whether this precedent was to be accepted.\n\nAn argument in favour of physician-assisted suicide based on the right to life may seem counterintuitive, however this argument is based on the proposition that the lack of any euthanasia services available to Seales was actively encouraging her to take her own life while she still had the autonomy and ability to do so. This has its grounding in section 8 of the NZBoRA. Collins J held that as he had come to the conclusion that the Crimes Act was to be interpreted in a way in which consent was no defence to assisting suicide, this had the effect of possibly forcing Seales to take her own life. This acted to engage section 8.\n\nHowever, when section 8 is engaged it only guarantees that the state will deprive someone of, or interfere with, their life on grounds established by law and that this interference must be consistent with the fundamental principles of justice. These fundamental principles are outlined in \"Carter v Canada\". These are:\n\nWhen determining ‘arbitrariness’, \"Chaoulli v Quebec\" is instructive. A law can be found to be arbitrary where it bears no relation to, or is inconsistent with, the objective that it pursues. In order not to be found to be arbitrary, the limit on life or liberty requires both a theoretical connection to the purpose of the legislation and a real connection on the facts. Collins J determined that the purpose of the relevant sections of the Crimes Act in New Zealand were created with the purpose to protect all life, it could not be found to be arbitrary, thus Seales' right to life was were not found to be limited arbitrarily.\n\nWhen concerning ‘overbreadth’ or whether the legislation was 'overly broad' as Collins J put it, the question is not whether Parliament had chosen the least restrictive means, but rather whether the chosen means infringe life, liberty, or security such that it has no connection with the crime or offence. In \"Carter\", it was held that the prohibition on suicide was overly broad, as the law went beyond what the courts thought that Parliament had intended. Here in \"Seales\", Collins held that he was not able to read section 179 of the Crimes Act in the same way as the Canadian equivalent, and thus there was no overreaching to be found.\n\nConcerning ‘gross disproportionality’, the issue is whether the legislation goes beyond what would be considered within the norms accepted by the society that the legislation is found within. This was first referred to in \"R v Malmo-Levine\" as a fundamental principle of justice. This standard is also set out in \"Canada v Bedford\" as one of legislative responses that are so extreme as to be disproportionate to any legitimate government interest. Collins J held that section 179(b) did not meet this standard, as it achieved its 'fair and reasonable' objective of protecting all life.\n\nThe case also considered the right not to be subject to torture or cruel treatment.\n\nIt was posed by Seales and her counsel that failing to allow her the ability to end her life was subjecting her to cruel treatment through effectively forcing her to have to live through, what was agreed by a number of professionals, to be quite a painful and debilitating terminal illness. However, previously it had been held in \"R v Martin (No 3)\" that section 8 of the NZBoRA cannot be used to affirm the right to be assisted to commit suicide. This previous judgment, coupled with the fact that it had been established by scholars that for a state’s actions to amount to ‘treatment’ there must be some positive action by the state or some exercise of state control over an individual, meant that the argument could not succeed. There was no relevant 'treatment' by the state. An example to help understand this is that of a heroin addict under the effects of drug control legislation. This may cause them pain and suffering due to withdrawals, but they are not considered subject to ‘treatment’ by the state. This is something that the House of Lords, the European Court of Human Rights and the Supreme Court of Canada all also agree upon.\n\nThe denial of the availability of physician-assisted suicide is where New Zealand legislation begins to fall short of other jurisdictions. The European Court of Human Rights and the Supreme Court of Canada have both in 2017, held that the prohibition on assisting another’s suicide is unlawful. Both jurisdictions have all subsequently acted to promote euthanasia in their respective areas of jurisdiction. And even the House of Lords in \"Pretty v United Kingdom\" has made steps towards the legalization of this procedure, setting out that despite this being Parliament’s job, there was a consideration needed by Parliament in order to be able to establish the legality of this matter. If the UK was to go as far as to legislate for euthanasia, it would leave New Zealand some distance behind in terms of caring for those with terminal illnesses.\n\n"}

The case has been recounted in subsequent pro-choice commentary on abortion in the Republic of Ireland.\n\nIn August 1981, Hodgers detected a breast lump and was referred to Our Lady of Lourdes Hospital, then run by the Medical Missionaries of Mary, a Catholic order of nuns. Some time after a lumpectomy there, her husband Brendan was told by the surgeon that a second tumour had been found which would be fatal if a mastectomy wasn't performed. Even with the operation, there was a strong chance of secondary tumours appearing. The operation was carried out and considered a success. Hodgers was prescribed a course of anti-cancer drugs and advised not to use the contraceptive pill as this could cause her cancer to return. According to journalist Padraig Yeates, Brendan Hodgers claimed a consultant told him that \"as Sheila had a clean bill of health, (pregnancy) shouldn't be a problem\". The consultant himself denied this. According to Yeates, every medical expert he spoke to said that following a mastectomy, it was standard advice to tell a woman to wait at least two years before becoming pregnant.\n\nOne year after the operation, Sheila Hodgers became pregnant. Since the anti-cancer drugs she was taking could harm the foetus, she was stopped from taking them. Hodgers began experiencing severe back pains and could hardly stand. Her husband urged the hospital to induce her pregnancy or perform a Caesarian section but they refused as it would damage the foetus. They also refused painkillers. The hospital had to abide by an alleged \"Bishop's Contract\", a code of ethics drawn up with the Catholic Church. During her time at Our Lady of Lourdes Hospital, Hodgers was attended to by at least seven doctors. Her husband said the only doctor there he trusted was Michael Neary.\n\nAccording to Brendan Hodgers: \"I went to see Sheila one night and she was in absolute agony. She was literally screaming at this stage. I could hear her from the front door of the hospital and she was in a ward on the fourth floor. I saw the sister and she produced a doctor who said nothing that made any sense.\n\nSheila Hodgers was subsequently moved to the maternity unit and given painkillers. According to Brendan, he at this point asked if an abortion could be performed but was given no answer. The couple again asked if an induction or Caesarian could be performed, and were again told the baby would not survive.\n\nOn 17 March 1983, Hodgers gave premature birth in extreme agony to a baby girl, Gemma, who immediately died. Hodgers died two days later from cancer in her neck, spine, legs, liver and ribs.\n"}
{"id": "1686162", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1686162", "title": "Sperm bank", "text": "Sperm bank\n\nA sperm bank, semen bank or cryobank is a facility or enterprise that purchases and stores human semen from sperm donors for use by women who need donor-provided sperm to achieve a pregnancy or pregnancies. Sperm sold by a sperm donor is known as donor sperm. Sperm may be introduced into the recipient woman by means of artificial insemination or by IVF and the process may also involve donated eggs or the use of a surrogate.\n\nFrom a medical perspective, a pregnancy achieved using donor sperm is no different from a pregnancy achieved using partner sperm, and it is also no different from a pregnancy achieved by sexual intercourse. By using sperm from a donor, however, the process is a form of third party reproduction.\n\nA sperm donor must generally meet specific requirements regarding age and medical history. In the United States, sperm banks are regulated as Human Cell and Tissue or Cell and Tissue Bank Product (HCT/Ps) establishments by the Food and Drug Administration. Many states also have regulations in addition to those imposed by the FDA. In the European Union a sperm bank must have a license according to the EU Tissue Directive. In the United Kingdom, sperm banks are regulated by the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Authority.\n\nSperm banks provide the opportunity to have a baby to single women and coupled lesbians, and to heterosexual couples where the male is infertile. They also enable greater safety by the checking and screening donors and by the access and timing of pregnancies. By using different methods of fertilization using donor sperm, a sperm bank may increase the chances of a pregnancy. \n\nSome controversy stems from the fact that donors father children for others but usually take no part in the upbringing of such children, and also from the fact that sperm banks often supply donor sperm or provide fertility services to single women and coupled lesbians, enabling them to have their own genetic child by a donor. Donors may not have a say in who may use their sperm. Another controversy centers around the use of sperm of deceased men as pioneered by California Cryobank.\n\nThe increasing range of services which is available through sperm banks nevertheless enables more couples to have choices over the whole issue of reproduction. Women may choose to use an anonymous donor who will not be a part of family life, or they may choose known donors who may be contacted later in life by the donor children. Women may choose to use a surrogate to bear their children, using eggs provided by the woman and sperm from a donor. Sperm banks often provide services which enable a woman to have subsequent pregnancies by the same donor, but equally, women may choose to have children by a number of different donors. Sperm banks sometimes enable a woman to choose the sex of her child, enabling even greater control over the way families are planned. Sperm banks increasingly adopt a less formal approach to the provision of their services thereby enabling people to take a relaxed approach to their own individual requirements.\n\nMen who donate their semen to a sperm bank do so with the intention that it will be used to enable women to have children whose partners have 'male factor' problems which prevent them from fathering children, or, more commonly, that they will enable women who have no male partner, such as single women and coupled lesbians, to have a child by them. Men who choose to donate semen through a sperm bank have the security of knowing that they are helping such women or childless couples to have children in circumstances where they, as the biological father, will not have any legal or other responsibility for the children produced from their sperm. Whether a donor is anonymous or not, this factor is important in allowing sperm banks to recruit sperm donors and to use their sperm to produce whatever number of pregnancies from each donor as are permitted where they operate, or alternatively, whatever number they decide.\n\nHowever, in many parts of the world sperm banks are not allowed to be established or to operate. Sperm banks do not provide a cure for infertility in that it is the sperm donor who reproduces himself, not a partner of the recipient woman. Most societies are built upon the family model and sperm banks may be seen as a threat to this, particularly where a sperm bank makes its services available to unmarried women.\n\nWhere sperm banks are allowed to operate they are often controlled by local legislation which is primarily intended to protect the unborn child, but which may also provide a compromise between the conflicting views which surround their operation. A particular example of this is the control which is often placed on the number of children which a single donor may father and which may be designed to protect against consanguinity. However, such legislation usually cannot prevent a sperm bank from supplying donor sperm outside the jurisdiction in which it operates, and neither can it prevent sperm donors from donating elsewhere during their lives. There is an acute shortage of sperm donors in many parts of the world and there is obvious pressure from many quarters for donor sperm from those willing and able to provide it to be made available as safely and as freely as possible.\n\nThe finding of a potential sperm donor and motivating him to actually donate sperm is typically called recruitment. A sperm bank can recruit donors by advertising, often in colleges and in local newspapers, and also on the internet.\n\nA donor must be a fit healthy male, normally between 18 and 45 years of age, who is willing to undergo frequent and rigorous testing and who is willing to donate his sperm so that it can be used to impregnate women who are unrelated to and unknown by him. The donor must agree to relinquish all legal rights to all children which result from his donations. The donor must produce his sperm at the sperm bank thus enabling the identity of the donor, once proven, always to be ascertained, and also enabling fresh samples of sperm to be produced for immediate processing.Some sperm banks have been accused of heightism due to minimum height requirements.\n\nA sperm donor must generally meet specific requirements regarding age and medical history.\n\nSperm banks typically screen potential donors for a range of diseases and disorders, including genetic diseases, chromosomal abnormalities and sexually transmitted infections that may be transmitted through sperm. The screening procedure generally also includes a quarantine period, in which the samples are frozen and stored for at least 6 months after which the donor will be re-tested for the STIs. This is to ensure no new infections have been acquired or have developed during the period of donation. Providing the result is negative, the sperm samples can be released from quarantine and used in treatments. Children conceived through sperm donation have a birth defect rate of almost a fifth compared with the general population.\n\nA sperm bank takes a number of steps to ensure the health and quality of the sperm which it supplies and it will inform customers of the checks which it undertakes, providing relevant information about individual donors. A sperm bank will usually guarantee the quality and number of motile sperm available in a sample after thawing. They will try to select men as donors who are particularly fertile and whose sperm will survive the freezing and thawing process. Samples are often sold as containing a particular number of motile sperm per millilitre, and different types of sample may be sold by a sperm bank for differing types of use, e.g. ICI or IUI.\n\nThe sperm will be checked to ensure its fecundity and also to ensure that motile sperm will survive the freezing process. If a man is accepted onto the sperm bank's program as a sperm donor, his sperm will be constantly monitored, the donor will be regularly checked for infectious diseases, and samples of his blood will be taken at regular intervals. A sperm bank may provide a donor with dietary supplements containing herbal or mineral substances such as maca, zinc, vitamin E and arginine which are designed to improve the quality and quantity of the donor's semen, as well as reducing the refractory time (i.e. the time between viable ejaculations). All sperm is frozen in straws or vials and stored for as long as the sperm donor may and can maintain it.\n\nDonors are subject to tests for infectious diseases such as human immunoviruses HIV (HIV-1 and HIV-2), human T-cell lymphotropic viruses (HTLV-1 and HTLV-2), syphilis, chlamydia, gonorrhea, Hepatitis B virus, Hepatitis C virus, cytomegalovirus (CMV), Trypanosoma cruzi and Malaria as well as hereditary diseases such as cystic fibrosis, Sickle cell anemia, Familial Mediterranean fever, Gaucher's disease, Thalassaemia, Tay-Sachs disease, Canavan's disease, Familial dysautonomia, Congenital adrenal hyperplasia \nCarnitine transporter deficiency and Karyotyping 46XY. Karyotyping is not a requirement in either EU or the US but some sperm banks choose to test donors as an extra service to the customer.\n\nA sperm donor may also be required to produce his medical records and those of his family, often for several generations. A sperm sample is usually tested micro-biologically at the sperm bank before it is prepared for freezing and subsequent use. A sperm donor's blood group may also be registered to ensure compatibility with the recipient.\n\nSome sperm banks may disallow sexually active gay men from donating sperm due to the population's increased risk of HIV and hepatitis B. Modern sperm banks have also been known to screen out potential donors based on genetic conditions and family medical history.\n\nThe majority of sperm donors who donate their sperm through a sperm bank receive some kind of payment, although this is rarely a significant amount. A review including 29 studies from 9 countries came to the result that the amount of money actual donors received for their donation varied from $10 to €70 per donation or sample. The payments vary from the situation in the United Kingdom where donors are only entitled to their expenses in connection with the donation, to the situation with some US sperm banks where a donor receives a set fee for each donation plus an additional amount for each vial stored. At one prominent California sperm bank for example, TSBC, donors receive roughly $50 for each donation (ejaculation) which has acceptable motility/survival rates both at donation and at a test-thaw a couple of days later. Because of the requirement for the two-day celibacy period before donation, and geographical factors which usually require the donor to travel, it is not a viable way to earn a significant income—and is far less lucrative than selling human eggs. Some private donors may seek remuneration although others donate for altruistic reasons. According to the EU Tissue Directive donors in EU may only receive compensation, which is strictly limited to making good the expenses and inconveniences related to the donation. A survey among sperm donors in Cryos International Sperm bank showed that altruistic as well as financial motives were the main factors for becoming a donor. However, when the compensation was increased 100% in 2004 (to DKK 500) it had no significant impact on either the numbers of new donor candidates coming in or the frequency of donations from the existing donors. When the compensation was reduced to the previous level (DKK 250) again one year later in 2005 there was no effect either. This led to the assumption that altruism is the main motive and that financial compensation is secondary.\n\nA sperm donor will usually be required to enter into a contract with a sperm bank to supply his semen, typically for a period of six to twenty-four months depending on the number of pregnancies which the sperm bank intends to produce from the donor. Where local regulations or the sperm bank's own rules limit the number of pregnancies which a single donor can achieve, his donations will be limited for this reason. In the United Kingdom, for example, where a donor is not permitted to father more than ten families, a sperm bank will generally need a maximum of 100 straws prepared for IUI insemination, so that a man will generally not donate for more than twelve months, unless the sperm bank exports or exchanges sperm with sperm banks outside the UK.\n\nHowever, not all donors complete the intended program of donations. If a sperm bank has access to world markets e.g. by direct sales, or sales to clinics outside their own jurisdiction, a man may donate for a longer period than two years, as the risk of consanguinity is reduced (although local laws vary widely). Some sperm banks with access to world markets impose their own rules on the number of pregnancies which can be achieved in a given regional area or a state or country, and these sperm banks may permit donors to donate for four or five years, or even longer. Faced with a growing demand for donor sperm, sperm banks may try to maximise the use of a donor whilst still reducing the risk of consanguinity.\n\nThe contract may also specify the place and hours for donation, a requirement to notify the sperm bank in the case of acquiring a sexual infection, and the requirement not to have intercourse or to masturbate for a period of usually 2–3 days before making a donation.\n\nA sperm donor generally produces and collects sperm at a sperm bank or clinic by masturbation in a private room or cabin, known as a 'men's production room' (UK), 'donor cabin' (DK) or a masturbatorium (USA). Many of these facilities contain pornography such as videos/DVD, magazines, and/or photographs which may assist the donor in becoming aroused in order to facilitate production of the ejaculate, also known as the \"semen sample\". In some circumstances, it may also be possible for semen from donors to be collected during sexual intercourse with the use of a collection condom.\n\nSperm banks and clinics usually 'wash' the sperm sample to extract sperm from the rest of the material in the semen. A cryoprotectant semen extender is added if the sperm is to be placed in frozen storage. One sample can produce 1-20 vials or straws, depending on the quantity of the ejaculate and whether the sample is 'washed' or 'unwashed'. 'Unwashed' samples are used for intracervical insemination (ICI) treatments, and 'washed' samples are used in intrauterine insemination (IUI) and for in-vitro fertilization (IVF) procedures.\n\nThe sperm is stored in small vials or straws holding between 0.4 and 1.0 ml of sperm and cryogenically preserved in liquid nitrogen tanks. It has been proposed that there should be an upper limit on how long frozen sperm can be stored; however, a baby has been conceived in the United Kingdom using sperm frozen for 21 years and andrology experts believe sperm can be frozen indefinitely. The UK government places an upper limit for storage of 55 years.\n\nBefore freezing, sperm may be prepared (washed or left unwashed) so that it can be used for intracervical insemination (ICI), intrauterine insemination (IUI) or for in-vitro fertilization (IVF) or assisted reproduction technologies (ART).\n\nFollowing the necessary quarantine period, which is usually 6 months, a sample will be thawed and used to artificially inseminate a woman or used for another assisted reproduction technologies (ART) treatment.\n\nSubject to any regulations restricting who can obtain donor sperm, donor sperm is available to all women who, for whatever reason, wishes to have a child. These regulations vary significantly between jurisdictions, and some countries do not have any regulations. When a woman finds that she is barred from receiving donor sperm within her jurisdiction, she may travel to another jurisdiction to obtain sperm. Regulations change from time to time. In most jurisdictions, donor sperm is available to a woman if her partner is infertile or where he has a genetic disorder. However, the categories of women who may obtain donor sperm is expanding, with its availability to single women and to lesbian couples becoming more common. Increasingly, donor sperm is used to achieve a pregnancy where a woman has no male partner, such as lesbian and bisexual women, and some sperm banks supply fertility centres which specialise in the treatment of such women.\n\nMen may also store their own sperm at a sperm bank for future use particularly where they anticipate traveling to a war zone or having to undergo chemotherapy which might damage the testes.\n\nSperm from a sperm donor may also be used in surrogacy arrangements and for creating embryos for embryo donation. Donor sperm may be supplied by the sperm bank directly to the recipient to enable a woman to perform her own artificial insemination which can be carried out using a needleless syringe or a cervical cap conception device. The cervical cap conception device allows the donor semen to be held in place close to the cervix for between six and eight hours to allow fertilization to take place. Alternatively, donor sperm can be supplied by a sperm bank through a registered medical practitioner who will perform an appropriate method of insemination or IVF treatment using the donor sperm in order for the woman to become pregnant.\n\nIn the United States, sperm banks maintain lists or catalogs of donors which provide basic information about the donor such as racial origin, skin color, height, weight, colour of eyes, and blood group. Some of these catalogs are available for browsing on the Internet, while others are made available to patients only when they apply to a sperm bank for treatment. Some sperm banks make additional information about each donor available for an additional fee, and others make additional basic information known to children produced from donors when those children reach the age of 18. Some clinics offer \"exclusive donors\" whose sperm is used to produce pregnancies for only one recipient woman. How accurate this is, or can be, is not known, and neither is it known whether the information produced by sperm banks, or by the donors themselves, is true. Many sperm banks will, however, carry out whatever checks they can to verify the information they request, such as checking the identity of the donor and contacting his own doctor to verify medical details.\n\nIn the United Kingdom, most donors are anonymous at the point of donation and recipients can see only non-identifying information about their donor (height, weight, ethnicity etc.). Donors need to provide identifying information to the clinic and clinics will usually ask the donor's doctor to confirm any medical details they have been given. Donors are asked to provide a pen portrait of themselves which is held by the HFEA and can be obtained by the adult conceived from the donation at the age of 18, along with identifying information such as the donor's name and last known address. Known donation is permitted and it is not uncommon for family or friends to donate to a recipient couple.\n\nQualities that potential recipients typically prefer in donors include the donors being tall, college educated, and with a consistently high sperm count.\nA review came to the result that 68% of donors had given information to the clinical staff regarding physical characteristics and education but only 16% had provided additional information such as hereditary aptitudes and temperament or character.\n\nSperm banks make information available about the sperm donors whose donations they hold to enable customers to select the donor whose sperm they wish to use. This information is often available by way of an online catalog. A sperm bank will also usually have facilities to help customers to make their choice and they will be able to advise on the suitability of donors for individual donors and their partners.\n\nWhere the recipient woman has a partner she may prefer to use sperm from a donor whose physical features are similar to those of her partner. In some cases, the choice of a donor with the correct blood group will be paramount, with particular considerations for the protection of recipients with negative blood groups. If a surrogate is to be used, such as where the customer is not intending to carry the child, considerations about her blood group etc. will also need to be taken into account.\n\nInformation made available by a sperm bank will usually include the race, height, weight, blood group, health and eye colour of the donor. Sometimes information about his age, family history and educational achievements will also be given. Some sperm banks make a 'personal profile' of a donor available and occasionally more information may be purchased about a donor, either in the form of a DVD or in written form. Catalogs usually state whether samples supplied in respect of a particular donor have already given rise to pregnancies, but this is not necessarily a guide to the fecundity of the sperm since a donor may not have been in the program long enough for any pregnancies to have been recorded.\n\nIf a woman intends to have more than one child, she may wish to have the additional child or children by the same donor. Sperm banks will usually advise whether sufficient stocks of sperm are available from a particular donor for subsequent pregnancies, and they normally have facilities available so that the woman may purchase and store additional vials from that donor on payment of an appropriate fee. These will be stored until required for subsequent pregnancies or they may be onsold if they become surplus to the woman's requirements.\n\nThe catalogue will also state whether samples of sperm are available for ICI, IUI, or IVF use.\n\nSome sperm banks enable recipients to choose the sex of their child, through methods of sperm sorting. Although the methods used do not guarantee 100% success, the chances of being able to select the gender of a child are held to be considerably increased.\n\nOne of the processes used is the 'swim up' method, whereby a sperm extender is added to the donor's freshly ejaculated sperm and the test-tube is left to settle. After about half-an-hour, the lighter sperm, containing the male chromosome pair (XY), will have swum to the top, leaving the heavier sperm, containing the female chromosome pair (XX), at the bottom, thus allowing selection and storage according to sex.\n\nThe alternative process is the Percoll Method which is similar to the 'swim up' method but involves additionally the centrifuging of the sperm in a similar way to the washing of samples produced for IUI inseminations, or for IVF purposes.\n\nSex selection is not permitted in a number of countries, including the UK.\n\nThere is a market for vials of processed sperm and for various reasons a sperm bank may sell-on stocks of vials which it holds (known as 'onselling'). The costs of screening of donors and of storage of frozen donor sperm vials are not insignificant and in practice most sperm banks will try to dispose of all samples from an individual donor. The onselling of sperm therefore enables a sperm bank to maximize the sale and disposal of sperm samples which it has processed. The reasons for onselling may also be where part of, or even the main business of, a particular sperm bank is to process and store sperm rather than to use it in fertility treatments, or where a sperm bank is able to collect and store more sperm than it can use within nationally set limits. In the latter case a sperm bank may onsell sperm from a particular donor for use in another jurisdiction after the number of pregnancies achieved from that donor has reached its national maximum.\n\nSperm banks may supply other sperm banks or a fertility clinic with donor sperm to be used for achieving pregnancies.\n\nSperm banks may also supply sperm for research or educational purposes.\n\nIn the United States, sperm banks are regulated as Human Cell and Tissue or Cell and Tissue Bank Product (HCT/Ps) establishments by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) with new guidelines in effect May 25, 2005. Many states also have regulations in addition to those imposed by the FDA, including New York and California.\n\nIn the European Union a sperm bank must have a license according to the EU Tissue Directive which came into effect on April 7, 2006. In the United Kingdom, sperm banks are regulated by the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Authority.\n\nIn countries where sperm banks are allowed to operate, the sperm donor will not usually become the legal father of the children produced from the sperm he donates, but he will be the 'biological father' of such children. In cases of surrogacy involving embryo donation, a form of 'gestational surrogacy', the 'commissioning mother' or the 'commissioning parents' will not be biologically related to the child and may need to go through an adoption procedure.\n\nAs with other forms of third party reproduction, the use of donor sperm from a sperm bank gives rise to a number of moral, legal and ethical issues.\n\nFurthermore, as local regulations reduce the size of the donor pool and, in some cases, exclude entire classes of potential buyers such as single women and lesbian couples, some customers choose to buy abroad or on the internet, having the samples delivered at home.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "44065428", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=44065428", "title": "Values Modes", "text": "Values Modes\n\nValues Modes is a segmentation tool in the United Kingdom, based on the British Values Survey.\n\nThe Values Modes model was created in 1973, by Pat Dade and Les Higgins. The tool, which is owned by the company Cultural Dynamics, is used strategically in marketing and political campaigns. It divides the population by values, identifying three core groups: Settlers, Prospectors and Pioneers. It is the main subject of the book \"What Makes People Tick\", by Chris Rose.\n\nThe Values Modes tool is based on the premise of twelve discrete psychographic types, under three umbrella groups. These were developed using a combination of empirical research and the application of Abraham Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs.\n\nThe British Values Survey asks a large sample of people a range of questions each year. It uses their answers to track how values are changing. Researchers gauge shifts in the values composition of certain groups and track changes in the overall population.\n\nThe British Values Survey measures over 100 psychological attributes of individuals, and includes Shalom Schwartz's Values scales model, which identifies ten core human values. Questions are based on a simple Likert scale. They range from everyday concerns (i.e. \"How much do you agree that products don't last as long as they used to?\") to questions on social issues like the sentencing of criminals.\n\nThere are three core umbrella groups, each of which contains four sub-groups.\n\nA person's 'values group' can affect how they view most issues, from the environment to taxation, immigration or economic and personal aspiration. Individuals with different values are said to perceive these issues differently, and are more amenable to certain changes. Values Modes is therefore used by some organisations to design policies, behaviour change strategies and social marketing campaigns. It has been deployed in areas including [public health, recycling and road safety, and has particular usage among local authorities looking to build relations with residents. Values Modes is also said to have business uses, and has also been applied to corporate governance in the past.\n\nA person's values can also affect the language they respond best to. Prospectors, for example, are reportedly more open than Settlers to statistics-led messaging, and there are also often clashes between service providers, who tend to be Pioneers, and service-users, who are often Settlers. The Values Modes tool is therefore also used by some communications departments, to prevent “clashes” and to \"tailor initiatives and messages to fit different value groups.\"\n\nAnalysts who use the Values Modes tool claim that, as class-based voting has \"dealigned\", it provides a more accurate model of voting behaviour than segmentation based on race or ethnicity, or social class-based approaches such as Mosaic and ACORN.\n\nThis has affected how analysts who use Values Modes view politics. In the case of the Labour Party, for example, it has been suggested that the distinction between Blue and New Labour is largely a distinction between an appeal to Settler and Prospector values. The tool has also been used in the media to analyse Barack Obama's victory in the 2012 U.S. presidential election, to explore messaging in the film An Inconvenient Truth, by Al Gore, and to inform the debate about the possibility of a UK Brexit from the EU.\n\nThis has led some to go further and link people's values to fundamental changes in the political spectrum – although the three main UK political parties each have a fairly even mix of the three values groups.\n\nSome figures on the political left have used the Values Modes tool to try and understand the rise of UK Independence Party (UKIP) – a political party with a predominantly Settler base (especially among those with Brave New World or Golden Dreamer values), which is built on preoccupations with issues like immigration. Nick Pecorelli argues that Labour lost many of its Settler supporters in office, and attributes the rise of UKIP, in part, to this change, writing that “Labour Settlers, once the bedrock of the party’s support, are gradually being dislodged from their tribal loyalties”. Values Modes were used as part of a Labour Party strategy on 'Beating Ukip on the Ground', which was incorporated into the Fabian Society paper, \"Revolt on the Left\".\n\nThe Values Modes tool is based on the premise that people switch between groups as life experiences change their values. If people's needs are met and goals are fulfilled they tend to make a transition through the groups. This shift usually takes the form of a move from Settler to Prospector to Pioneer, as immediate, sustenance-driven needs are replaces with more abstract concerns.\n\nThe British Values Survey indicates that, since data collection began, the proportion of the UK population in different values groups has changed significantly. The period 1973–2005 saw a shift away from Settler values – probably because of greater affluence meaning core needs were more often being met. Since the 2008 economic crisis, the survey describes a return, by some of the less optimistic Prospectors, to Settler values, perhaps as a result of resources being scarcer.\n\nThe table below tracks changes to the UK values composition over time. The increase in Prospector values between 2011 and 2012 is \"hints at a hesitant return to optimism or perhaps a normalisation of austerity.\"\n\nThe Common Cause Foundation set of \"cultural values\"] is seen by some as an alternative approach to Values Modes. A RSA (Royal Society for the encouragement of Arts, Manufactures and Commerce) blog on the subject, written in February 2013, described the Common Cause critique of Values Modes as being that \"Rather than satiating that level of Maslow’s ‘Hierarchy of Needs’ – and thus prompting people move to new more globally compassionate, caring needs – Values Modes will just strengthen the values of selfish consumerism.\" Pat Dade, according to the blog, responded by saying that such an approach would \"alienate many, perhaps even most of the UK population, who don’t enjoy the feeling of being lectured in worthy-sounding \"Guardian\"-esque language, and rarely if ever change their behaviour as a result of it.\"\n\n\n"}

The service is available to all Australians and allows consumers to rate their experience of a healthcare provider and read other users’ recommendations and reviews.\nWhitecoat provides contact details and ratings information for more than 210,000 Australian healthcare providers across 25 different provider types, including dentists, optometrists, and physiotherapists. Along with providing publicly-available contact details for different healthcare providers, the Whitecoat website carries ratings information regarding availability, listening skills, explanation of treatment and likelihood to recommend as well as comments from customers about their overall service experience. Reviews are sourced from Whitecoat users as well as members of affiliated private health insurers who have been provided with a billable service from the provider. It hosts more than 250,000 customer reviews and while the platform now includes allied healthcare providers such as dentists, physiotherapists, and general practitioners, it is looking to expand to include medical specialists. The site has been likened to being the 'Trip Advisor' of the healthcare sector.\n\nThe site was originally launched in 2013 by NIB Health Funds to allow their members to easily search and compare healthcare providers, in response to ongoing customer demand for better information about healthcare providers. The site collates reviews from clients that use their associated providers. Previously the website only allowed NIB health insurance members to leave reviews, despite all Australians being able to read these recommendations.\n\nIn July 2016, Bupa and HBF signed a heads of agreement to join nib as investors and participants in expanding the Whitecoat healthcare provider platform. With the participation by Bupa and HBF along with foundation investor nib, Whitecoat will increase its reach to approximately six million Australians. Also in 2016, Whitecoat announced its plans to provide consumers with cost transparency of medical procedures on its website, as a result of 2014-15 NIB claims data that revealed significant fee variations paid to medical specialists, which left consumers with out-of-pocket costs. At the same time, Whitecoat announced it would also allow consumers to book and pay for treatment through the website.\n\nWhitecoat was featured in the Australian Financial Review where audiences were updated on current progress of Whitecoat within the health industry. Whitecoat CEO Matthew Donnellan commented on increasingly high out-of-pocket costs from insurance funds, warning people to \"get used to it and go online\". He stated that \"up to 85 per cent of people do not even ask how much they will pay out-of-pocket for surgery until they are admitted as inpatients. By the time they are in hospital for a shoulder reconstruction or retinal surgery it is too late to start haggling over the bill\" The joint venture between nib, Bupa and HBF is said to allow patients and GP's scheduling a course of treatment to know well in advance just how much a hospital will charge out-of-pocket against a specific health insurance policy. \nDonnellan commented on this issue following a tirade against the private health insurance industry by Opposition Leader, Bill Shorten. He stated \"Prices are up, profits are up, quality and value are down. Australian's are paying a lot more for their health insurance policies and getting a lot less\". A decade ago exclusions and out-of-pocket costs was apparent for approximately 9 per cent of private health funds, this figure has increased to 40 per cent as of 2018. Donnellan highlighted that Whitecoat aims to help consumers deal with the reality of these increasing payments burdened on Australians. \n\nThe Australian Financial Review published an article titled 'Talking to a Doctor is a Two-Way Conversation' with content produced by The Australian Financial Review in Commercial Partnership with the Commonwealth Bank of Australia. Matthew Donnellan commented, \"Health is like oxygen; when there's lots of it about nobody cares. But when there's not much about no one cares about much else. Consumers want to treat healthcare in exactly the way they treat every other aspect of life.\" Donnellan was hinting at the ridiculous notion of having to present a healthcare card in hope of finding out you're covered - in 2017. \"I can sit here now and book a trip around the world including all my flights, accommodation and transfers and yet that's easier to do than a referral pathway to see a surgeon. And there is nothing more important in my life when I need an operation, than that operation.\" In 2018 Whitecoat will release a new data system to GPs that will provide them with a participating surgeon or specialists' availability and average out-of-pocket procedures, regardless of their 'no gap' or 'gap' status. Development of Whitecoat in 2018 aims \"to be more transparent not just for patients, but for GP's who can have all the criteria they need in 10 seconds\".\n\nAs of 2018 Whitecoat has 65,000 health care providers listed on its website, including 16,000 Specialists and 11,000 General Practitioners. \nAs of 2018 Whitecoat has between 4 and 5 million visitors per year and 575,000 moderated reviews from patients. These offer future patients their opinions and perspectives on listed healthcare professionals. \nApps that have been developed will be released in early-mid 2018. Two apps, MyWhitecoat for patients and Whitecoat Pro for healthcare professionals. Resulting will be a cardless, cashless payment system that allows healthcare professionals to process health fund payments and gap payments right there and then, through a mobile app.\n\n"}

In the early 1990s, he joined Pr. Rutter's MRC Child Psychiatry Unit at the Institute of Psychiatry at King's College London where he held a Senior Lecturer post and an Honorary Consultant position at the Maudsley Hospital. In 1997, he was promoted as Reader In Epidemiological Psychiatry at the Institute of psychiatry. In 2001, he was appointed at McGill University in Canada as tenured full professor in Psychiatry. From 2001 to 2009, he directed the child psychiatry division at McGill University and the psychiatry department at the Montreal Children's Hospital, where he played a key role in the launch of its autism clinical and research program. Fombonne is also the recipient of the Canada Research Chair in child psychiatry since 2001. He is a practicing child psychiatrist and has clinics at the Montreal Children's Hospital for subjects with autism and other developmental disorders. Fombonne was president of the Association of Professors of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry of Canada (APCAPC). He was Associate Editor of the Journal of Autism and Developmental Disorders from 1994 to 2003, and is a member of several editorial boards, and a consultant for several scientific organizations such as NIH/NIMH or foundations. Over the years, he has been a supportive member of several family associations, including Autism France and Autism Europe.\n\nHis research focuses on epidemiological investigations of childhood mental illness and related risk factors, with a particular focus on the epidemiology of autism. He conducted the first population based survey of child psychiatric disorders among school aged children in France. In the UK, he conducted research on childhood depression and its long term outcomes. In France and in the UK, and later in Canada, he performed several surveys of autism in childhood populations. He and his colleagues were credited with demonstrating that there is no epidemiological evidence of a link between the MMR vaccine or mercury-containing vaccines and autism, as postulated by other researchers including Andrew Wakefield. Fombonne was subsequently involved as a key scientific expert witness in several trials in US courts and class actions. He was influential in explicating the lack of evidence linking thimerosal in vaccines, or specific vaccine types such as MMR, to autism in children. He testified on behalf of the US DHSS and the US Department of Justice in well publicized trials in front of the Vaccine Injury Compensation Court in Washington DC between 2006 and 2008.\n\nHe has conducted several epidemiological studies of child and adolescent psychopathology, looking at overall mental health, depression, eating and substance use disorders. An early focus of his work was on secular trends in the incidence of youth mental health disorders, and factors that might cause these changes over time. One of the major studies conducted by Fombonne examined depression and suicidal behaviors, which linked alcohol abuse to increased suicidal tendencies in boys, using data on 6,000 subjects. He has also been involved in long-term outcome studies of child and adolescent depression.\n\nAt McGill University, Fombonne has consolidated the Autism Spectrum Disorder program at the Montreal Children's Hospital since his appointment there in 2001. He currently heads an autism research program directed at evaluating environmental risk factors, such as vaccines and environmental neurotoxicants, and investigating genetic risks associated with the heritability of autism. He has also been involved in several molecular genetic studies of autism, and in outcome studies of autism spectrum disorders.\nFombonne recently conducted a metanalysis of available epidemiological evidence of the prevalence of autism. His review concluded that the prevalence rate for autism is 25/10,000 and the rate of all pervasive developmental disorders around 90/10,000. However, he also noted several more recent studies indicating a much higher prevalence rate than this with a broader inclusion basis. He attributes the apparent rise in autism cases to wider recognition of the condition, and argues that claims of an 'autism epidemic' are unfounded unless proven otherwise. In 2001, he told the BBC \"That rates in recent surveys are substantially higher than 30 years ago merely reflects the adoption of a much broader concept of autism, a recognition of autism among normally intelligent subjects and an improved identification of persons with autism.\" However, he also states that a real change in the incidence of autism in human populations may also have contributed to the upward trends and that environmental risk factors that may influence these changes should be examined.\n\nFombonne has written over 260 scientific reports in peer reviewed journals and 40 book chapters. He was associate editor of the \"Journal of Autism and Developmental Disorders\" from 1994 to 2003.\n\n\n"}
