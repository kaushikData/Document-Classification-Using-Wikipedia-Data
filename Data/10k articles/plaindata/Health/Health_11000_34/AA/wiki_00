The film follows the filmmaker's friend Sam and features an interview with mental health scholar Kay Redfield Jamison. It was directed by Benjamin Selkow. The documentary debuted on the Sundance Channel in 2007.\n\n\"A Summer in the Cage\" is filmmaker Ben Selkow's feature-length documentary chronicling his friend Sam's battle with manic-depressive illness. The film follows Sam for seven years as he suffers delusional manic episodes, battles paralyzing depressions, and tries to escape the legacy of his bipolar father who committed suicide when Sam was eight years old. By showing the difficult emotional impact of being bipolar on Sam, his family, and the filmmaker, \"A Summer in the Cage\" puts a human face on an illness that affects millions of American families. But as this dramatic story unfolds and finally reaches an explosive standoff, it also becomes a unique tale about friendship and the ethical responsibilities of a documentary filmmaker.\n\n"}
{"id": "44558200", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=44558200", "title": "Abortion in Afghanistan", "text": "Abortion in Afghanistan\n\nAbortion in Afghanistan is affected by the religious constraints from the national religion, Islam, and by the extremely high birthrates in Afghanistan. Afghanistan has one of the highest fertility rates, but its levels are decreasing since the fall of the Taliban, as aid workers can now enter the country to help with fertility and decrease mortality rates. An abortion is the deliberate termination of an unplanned or unwanted pregnancy, but women and couples have other reasons to perform them as well. Afghan law is influenced by Islamic law, which comes from the religious text the Qur’an, which Muslims believe comes from God. These laws state that abortion is only legal if it is performed to save the life of the mother or if the child is going to be born with a severe disability. This interpretation fo Islamic law is based in Islamic medicine, as Muslims cherish the sanctity of human life and believe God does not cause harm or illnesses that are incurable. Due to these constraints, women choose either to pursue an abortion illegally or be shunned by society due to a pregnancy outside of the socially accepted norms. Contraception is approved by Islam when it prevents the formation of the zygote and prevents implantation in the uterus. \n\nAfghanistan has one of the highest fertility rates in the world, with very few women actively using contraceptive methods, despite support from the government and conformance with religious ethics. Only 22.5% of people utilize contraceptive measures in comparison to the United States, where 74.1% of people utilize contraception. In the 1990s, the average woman had 8 children throughout her lifetime, but this decreased in the mid-2000s to 6.,1 with hopes to hit an average of 5 births per woman by the end of 2010.\n\nSince the Taliban's fall in 2001, fertility levels are decreasing, stemming from the Taliban's belief in not educating girls, child brides, and not providing healthcare for women. The decreased presence of the Taliban has allowed an entrance of aid workers to the country to provide educational funding for schools, family planning, and more access to birth control. The uncontrolled high fertility rates make it difficult for Afghanistan to manage the poverty levels and improve other social conditions which leaves a high dependence on aid from other countries. High fertility rates cause high birthrates, which contribute to the high fetal mortality rate. Afghanistan has the highest fetal mortality rate in the world, with 110.6 deaths per 1000 births. Mothers are also 19.9 years old on average at her first birth. As access to education across Afghanistan is increasing due to the fall of the Taliban, the fetal mortality rate is also decreasing. In rural areas the mortality rate still remains high, but aid workers are being sent to many regions of the country after receiving training on deliveries and care for newborns.\n\nAn important aspect of abortion is the stage of the cells in the womb. The cells have many different names at the different stages they pass through, and the stage affects the acceptability of the procedure. Prenatal Development outlines these different stages. From conception, when the sperm and egg fuse in the fallopian tube, until week 5 of the pregnancy, it is referred to as the zygote. From week 5 until week 10 of the pregnancy, it is referred to as an embryo. At week 10 in the pregnancy, the embryo becomes a fetus and development of all organ systems and body parts begins. At around the 38-40th week, a fully developed baby will be born. For Islam followers, once the cells reach the zygote stage abortions are no longer acceptable. But contraceptive methods are acceptable if the formation of the zygote is prevented.\n\nIslamic law comes from the Qur'an, which they believe comes from God and Muslims use it to dictate their every day actions. The religious laws of Islam dictate strict policies on gender interactions. One of these requirements is that women use a female gynecologist. Islamic rule says that males in the medical field should only treat females if there are no other females in the field to care for them. Women are more likely to seek care from a female gynecologist to conform to their religious convictions. A suggested improvement is to increase the number of female doctors in Afghanistan to encourage seeking professional help rather than nonprofessional help.\n\nIslamic medicine ideals are based on the sanctity of human life, which states that God created humans and did not create diseases or other ailments that do not have cures or other solutions that humans have the ability to discover. Muslim teachings say that human life begins at conception because the fetus is able to perform actions within the womb that humans outside of the womb are able to perform, such as movement and digestion. This means that the fetus has a soul. This means that the fetus has rights, which the mother is responsible for protecting until delivery. This leads to the overriding belief that abortion should be avoided whenever possible. Any action that would take away the soul of the fetus is illegal. This includes a pregnant mother being murdered leading to the murderer being tried for both deaths; or if the father dies while the mother is pregnant the estate will not be divided until the birth of the child, because the fetus has rights to the estate and the father's inheritances. However, in cases of rape, abortion is not permitted because one crime cannot be solved with another crime, and having an abortion for reasons other than the health of the mother and the baby is considered a crime. If a fetus is predicted to die right after birth, the mother and the father must make the decision, considering all factors, that they feel aligns best with the Qur'an.\n\nIslam approves certain forms of contraception as well. Contraceptive methods are acceptable when they prevent ovulation and formation of the zygote. Once the zygote has formed, which means the egg and the sperm have fused, it is considered a human life and thus is protected as such. Ethicists believe that the proper use of contraceptives prevents the need for abortion and the consideration of the moral dilemma.\n\nDue to the religious views on abortion, society stigmatizes the women who receive abortions. Many women account that they are stuck deciding between whether to have an abortion or have a child outside of marriage, both of which cause them to be ostracized from society. Some reasons that lead women to pursue abortions to avoid being ostracized include drug and/or alcohol addicted husbands, poverty, and being single. Due to the constraints that the government places on access to abortions, women must pursue abortion through illegal means to avoid being shunned by their families or punished criminally. The culture in Afghanistan developed both from the government and religion, makes women believe that it is their job to have children. This social role for women does not take into account that Afghanistan has an extremely high birthrate, ranked 12th in the world, with little access to education on family planning and contraceptive usage.\n\nAfghan legislation is based heavily in Islam, with the preamble of their constitution referencing Allah. Article 3 of Chapter 1 outlines that no law in Afghanistan should contradict Islam. The Afghan Independent Human Rights Commission was created to protect human rights and as a response to Shia Family Law, which violates human rights. The heavy influence of religious beliefs on the law leads to strict laws surrounding abortion. Chapter 4 of the Afghanistan Penal Code outlines the consequences for performing abortions. It states that abortions outside of saving the life of the mother or if the babies life is endanger, interpreted as a severe disability or low quality of life, are illegal. Article 402 says that anyone who purposefully kills a fetus will be sentenced to no more than 7 years in prison. Article 403 says that anyone who performs the abortion will either be imprisoned or fined up to approximately 12,000 Afghanis ($165USD). If the person performing the abortion is a doctor they will be punished to the fullest extent of the law.\n\nFew legal cases allow women to seek abortion care. Women are able to get an abortion when their life is endangered by the pregnancy, or if the baby will be born with severe deformities or disabilities. Religious ethical committees must rule on the ethics and legality of the abortion before it can be carried out. After ethical approval of the abortion, the woman must obtain approval from a gynecologist, three general practitioners, a counselor, and permission of the doctor. One additional situation that occasionally allows abortion to occur is due to poverty. This is especially prominent in areas that the Taliban is still present in. Within Taliban controlled areas, poverty based abortions are generally approved more often because they have too many children.\n\nWomen often pursue abortions through illegal means because of the few cases that allow abortions legally. They believe it is necessary in order to avoid shame from their husbands, families, and society. This leads women to having to fund the abortion themselves, which can be difficult because of the social norm that implies that it is women's job to have children and thus they don't have jobs outside of taking care of the house and the family. Many women would prefer not to have children, but lack knowledge of how to limit the number of children they have outside of use of abortions. When pursuing abortions, they many times need to use uneducated midwives who don't know how to properly perform the procedure or deal with complications. Another option they have is to use expensive private clinics, which leads to the issue of funding the expenditure. Since women are typically unemployed, rounding up the funds for an abortion can be difficult. The price of an abortion has decreased from 250,000 Afghanis (US$3,500) to 17,500 Afghanis (US$250). This decrease has been seen because of the increasing need of abortions. But the price is still 15,000 Afghani (US$150) higher than the average price of an abortion in the United States, where abortions are legal and generally publicly accepted.\n\nAfghanistan is in the top 16 worldwide for the highest mortality rate from abortion. The healthcare system in Afghanistan is also not at a level to properly care for pregnant mothers. Every 2 hours there is a pregnancy-related death in Afghanistan. The high maternal mortality is due to lack of post procedure care. Although the procedure is illegal in most cases, women still pursue abortions, motivating aid workers to make it safer. International aid workers are working to improve the safety of the procedures by educating midwives and nurses about how to improve care for their patients and limit the mortality of the procedure. Aid workers hope to decrease the stigma surrounding the procedure so that there is lower mortality.\n"}
{"id": "7863675", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=7863675", "title": "Anthrax Vaccine Immunization Program", "text": "Anthrax Vaccine Immunization Program\n\nThe Anthrax Vaccine Immunization Program (AVIP), is the name of the policy set forth by the U.S. federal government to immunize its military and certain civilian personnel with the \"BioThrax\" anthrax vaccine. It began in earnest in 1997 by the Clinton administration. Thereafter it ran into Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and judicial obstacles (mainly concerning the methods and viability of the vaccine manufactured by BioPort, a subsidiary of Emergent BioSolutions Inc.). Over 8 million doses of \"BioThrax\" were administered to over 2 million U.S. military personnel as part of the program between March 1998 and June 2008.\nIn 1998, the Clinton administration required the inoculation of all military members with the anthrax vaccine known as Anthrax Vaccine Adsorbed (AVA) and by the trade name \"BioThrax\". In June 2001, the DoD halted vaccinations due to non-FDA approved changes in BioPort's manufacturing process.\n\nIn 1999 at Offutt Air Force Base, the first ever Anthrax refusal court-martial in the United States Air Force was prosecuted. In the case of U.S. v. Bickley, Captain Jeffrey A. Lustick, USAF, prosecuted an airman's refusal to submit to the immunization. The airman was convicted and later administratively separated from the U.S. Air Force.\n\nOn October 15, 2001, military members filed a FDA Citizen Petition highlighting the fact that the license for AVA had never formally been finalized by the FDA in accordance with the requirements of 21 CFR § 10.30 as Docket # 01P-0471. The Petition was later utilized as the foundational basis for a Preliminary Injunction by a Federal Court to temporarily halt the program [\"Doe v. Rumsfeld\", 297 F. Supp. 2d 119 (D.D.C. 2003)].\n\nOn June 28, 2002, in the wake of the 2001 anthrax attacks and leading up to the 2003 invasion of Iraq, all military personnel were required to receive AVA in addition to their other vaccinations of smallpox. The military does give this vaccination regularly as well as Japanese encephalitis (JEV) when the service member is to be deployed to Southeast Asia, and other vaccines such as pneumococcal, tetanus, among others.\nWhile some military personnel had questions about the safety of the vaccine, it was considered a lawful order at that time, and this made refusing the vaccine at peril of the subordinate, including possible discharge (i.e., losing their job and any benefits depending on the type of discharge). This pressure, at least for the National Guard and Reserve pilots and crewmembers, became a deciding retention factor.\n\nLater that month, the DOD made it policy to include any personnel spending 15 days or more in high anthrax-risk areas, such as the Persian Gulf or the Korean peninsula.\nIn December 2003, Judge Emmet G. Sullivan of the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia ruled that the Department of Defense could not force military personnel to take the vaccine unless through a special order by the president.\n\nIn October 2004, for about 8 days in (October 20–28), anthrax vaccinations were resumed, but then an injunction against mandatory vaccination was filed on the basis that AVA was not proven to work against inhalation anthrax. The ruling held that the mandatory program was illegal. The DoD was now required to either let the individual member choose under an informed consent policy, or allowed the president to bypass this requirement by executive order (\"Doe v. Rumsfeld\", 341 F. Supp. 2d 1, 6 (D.D.C. 2004)). For military members who had started the vaccination (which usually takes build-up and booster shots), they tended to continue the vaccination program under informed consent. For those who had a choice, they usually decided against it.\n\nOn December 15, 2005, the FDA re-issued a Final Rule & Order on the license status of AVA, clearing the way for mandatory vaccination reinstatement. After reviewing extensive scientific evidence and carefully considering comments from the public, the FDA again determined that the vaccine is licensed for the prevention of anthrax, regardless of the route of exposure. Pertaining to the previous ruling, the DC District Federal Appeals Court declined to vacate or overturn the injunction in 2006, instead mooting the case based on the FDA’s new 2005 licensing of the vaccine.[\"Doe v. Rumsfeld\", 127 Fed. App’x 327 (D.C. Cir. 2006)]\n\nOn October 16, 2006 the military announced intentions to resume vaccinations for select personnel again, but the vaccinations remained voluntary until further guidance by the DoD. The DoD's official resumption status of the program awaited publication of service messages.\n\nOn December 13, 2006, a new class-action lawsuit, filed on behalf of six unnamed plaintiffs, revived the legal battle over the military’s mandatory anthrax immunization program. According to court documents, the basic premise of the lawsuit is the plaintiffs’ claim that the vaccine is “unapproved for its applied/intended use”. The lawsuit says that “plaintiffs will suffer substantial and irreparable injury if they are forced to take the vaccine”, which the suit says has not been properly approved by the government, despite the FDA issuing its “final rule” on the vaccine on December 15, 2005. The suit also says the DOD has failed to follow presidential orders and federal laws that require the government to obtain informed consent before giving an unapproved and experimental vaccine to anyone.\n\nOn February 8, 2007, the military has resumed mandatory vaccinations of certain troops. Specific policies and troop selection varies according to branch of service.\n\nBy August 2007, the original court affirmed that the AVIP was not substantially justified prior to the consequent FDA licensure and requisite rule making for the vaccine in December 2005. The Court ultimately granted “prevailing party” status for the plaintiffs against defendants DoD and FDA [Doe v. Rumsfeld, 501 F. Supp. 2d 186, 188 (D.D.C. 2007)].\n\nBy March 2008, a different Federal Judge affirmed the prior ruling in its opinion regarding corrections of records writing, “Taken as a whole, Judge Sullivan’s decisions in \"Doe v. Rumsfeld\" conclude that, prior to the FDA’s December 2005 rulemaking, it was a violation of federal law for military personnel to be subjected to involuntary AVA inoculation because the vaccine was neither the subject of a presidential waiver nor licensed for use against inhalation anthrax.”\n\nBy August 6, 2008, an FBI press briefing theorized that the \"failing\" anthrax vaccine immunization program led as the primary motivator in the fall 2001 anthrax letter attacks allegedly perpetrated by U.S. Army scientist Bruce Ivins. FBI documents reveal the FDA \"suspended further production\" of anthrax vaccine just prior to the attacks (Ivins' emails and FBI analysis available on pp. 12–16 of affidavit). Failed potency tests prevented FDA approval. FBI released emails by Ivins showing the vaccine \"isn’t passing the potency test\" and that \"no approved lots\" were available just prior to the letter attacks. The FBI explained Ivins' involvement with the failed potency tests. FBI affidavits also documented Ivins receiving the highest Defense Department honors for \"getting the anthrax vaccine back into production\". The U.S. Department of Justice press statements theorized Ivins’ anthrax letter attack motive: \"by launching these attacks, he creates a situation, a scenario, where people all of a sudden realize the need to have this vaccine\".\n\nOn October 1, 2008, Michael O. Leavitt, Secretary of Health and Human Services, declared a need \"to provide targeted liability protections for anthrax countermeasures\" because \"I have determined there is a credible risk that the threat of exposure of \"B. anthracis\" and the resulting disease constitutes a public health emergency\" until the year 2015. Emergent BioSolutions immediately prepared to supply 14.5 million doses of anthrax vaccine by 2011.\n\nOn February 19, 2010, the FBI released its final summary on the Amerithrax investigation. The \"motive\", according to the FBI, was detailed on page 8 of the report: \"Motive. According to his e-mails and statements to friends, in the months leading up to the anthrax attacks in the fall of 2001, Dr. Ivins was under intense personal and professional pressure. The anthrax vaccine program to which he had devoted his entire career of more than 20 years was failing. The anthrax vaccines were receiving criticism in several scientific circles, because of both potency problems and allegations that the anthrax vaccine contributed to Gulf War syndrome. Short of some major breakthrough or intervention, he feared that the vaccine research program was going to be discontinued. Following the anthrax attacks, however, his program was suddenly rejuvenated.\" The FBI continued on page 39 finding, \"within a few months of the anthrax attacks, the FDA fast-tracked the approval process and approved the Anthrax Vaccine Adsorbed (“AVA”), even though it didn't meet the original potency standards. This was a significant development for the anthrax researchers.\"\n\nTo date, the DOD has not announced a reevaluation of the AVIP, nor consideration of correcting the records of previously punished soldiers, in light of the above-mentioned legislative, legal and criminal findings related to the anthrax vaccine.\n\nThis is a pamphlet distributed to military members regarding their vaccinations after the Emergency Use Authorization from the FDA after April 4, 2005.\n\n\n"}

It is the longest and best preserved of four Roman aqueducts that served the growing capital of the Roman province of Gallia Lugdunensis. It drew its water from the source of the Gier, a small tributary of the Rhone, on the slopes of Mont Pilat, south-west of Lyon.\n\nFollowing a sinuous path, at the aqueduct of the Gier is the longest known of the Roman aqueducts. Its route has been retraced in detail, following the numerous remains. Leaving the uplands of the \"massif du Pilat\", department of the Loire, the aqueduct hugs the surface relief and crosses the department of the Rhone, passing through Mornant, Orliénas, Chaponost and Sainte-Foy-lès-Lyon to terminate at Lyon.\n\nIn its extent, it draws upon the whole repertory of Roman techniques of aqueduct building, taking a slope that averages 0.1%, or a meter every kilometer. There are of covered ditches laid with a concrete culvert high and wide, which is sunk as deep as beneath the land surface. The aqueduct passes through 11 tunnels, one of which, near Mornant, is in extent. Access for cleaning and repairs was through manholes at distances. There are some thirty stretches in the open air. There are ten stretches raised on walls and arches, which provide the most spectacular visible remains of the aqueduct (\"illustrations\"). \n\nFour inverted siphon tunnels cross the particularly deep and wide river valleys of the Durèze, the Garon, the Yzeron and the Trion on pipe bridges raised on high arches. In these, water filled a sunken tank tower (\"castellum\") on the brim of a slope. The tank effected a transition between open channel flow and a lead pipeline. From the \"castellum\" water was carried, now pressurized, in a set of airtight lead pipes laid side by side, with soldered joints, down the valley slope, across a bridge spanning the river—whose piers and arches are the most notable remains of the system—and up the facing slope, to a tank slightly lower than the head tank, losing just a little hydraulic head in the process. The inverted siphons obviated the bridging of deep valleys with arcade upon arcade of arches, as at Pont du Gard, which marks the limit of such a system.\n\nThe Gier aqueduct was built in a single great campaign, since no part of it could have served until it was completed; it must have taken years. The aqueduct of Giers was dated by Germain de Montauzon to the reign of Hadrian in the early 2nd century AD, but, as James Stephen Bromwich points out, its reticulated stonework (\"opus reticulatum\") was characteristic of the later 1st century BC and the first half of the 1st century AD, rather than of later masonry. In addition he notes that a recently excavated public fountain on the hill of Fourvières, datable about 50 AD could not have been supplied with water until the Giers aqueduct was complete.\n\nIn French:\n"}

The data produced are an integral part of health information management, and are used by local and national governments, private healthcare organizations and international agencies for various purposes, including medical and health services research, epidemiological studies, health resource allocation, case mix management, public health programming, medical billing, and public education.\n\nFor example, a clinical coder may use a set of published codes on medical diagnoses and procedures, such as the International Classification of Diseases (ICD) or the Common Coding System for Healthcare Procedures (HCPCS), for reporting to the health insurance provider of the recipient of the care. The use of standard codes allows insurance providers to map equivalencies across different service providers who may use different terminologies or abbreviations in their written claims forms, and be used to justify reimbursement of fees and expenses. The codes may cover topics related to diagnoses, procedures, pharmaceuticals or topography. The medical notes may also be divided into specialities for example cardiology, gastroenterology, nephrology, neurology , pulmonology or orthopedic care.\n\nA clinical coder therefore requires a good knowledge of medical terminology, anatomy and physiology, a basic knowledge of clinical procedures and diseases and injuries and other conditions, medical illustrations, clinical documentation (such as medical or surgical reports and patient charts), legal and ethical aspects of health information, health data standards, classification conventions, and computer- or paper-based data management, usually as obtained through formal education and/or on-the-job training.\n\nThe basic task of a clinical coder is to classify medical and health care concepts using a standardised classification. Most clinical coders are employed in coding inpatient episodes of care. However, mortality events, outpatient episodes, general practitioner visits and population health studies can all be coded.\n\nClinical coding has three key phases: a) Abstraction; b) Assignment; and c) Review.\n\nThe abstraction phase involves reading the entire record of the health encounter and analysing the information to determine what condition(s) the patient had, what caused it and how it was treated. The information comes from a variety of sources within the medical record, such as clinical notes, laboratory and radiology results, and operation notes.\n\nThe assignment phase has two parts: finding the appropriate code(s) from the classification for the abstraction; and entering the code into the system being used to collect the coded data.\n\nReviewing the code set produced from the assignment phase is very important. Clinical coder must ask themselves, \"does this code set fairly represent what happened to this patient in this health encounter at this facility?\" By doing this, clinical coders are checking that they have covered everything that they must, but not used extraneous codes. For health encounters that are funded through a case mix mechanism, the clinical coder will also review the diagnosis-related group (DRG) to ensure that it does fairly represent the health encounter.\n\nClinical coders may have different competency levels depending on the specific tasks and employment setting.\n\nAn entry level coder has completed (or nearly completed) an introductory training program in using clinical classifications. Depending on the country; this program may be in the form of a certificate, or even a degree; which has to be earned before the trainee is allowed to start coding. All trainee coders will have some form of continuous, on-the-job training; often being overseen by a more senior coder. \n\nAn intermediate level coder has acquired the skills necessary to code many cases independently. Coders at this level are also able to code cases with incomplete information. They have a good understanding of anatomy and physiology along with disease processes. Intermediate level coders have their work audited periodically by an Advanced coder.\n\nAdvanced level and senior coders are authorized to code all cases including the most complex. Advanced coders will usually be credentialed and will have several years of experience. An advanced coder is also able to train entry-level coders.\n\nA nosologist understands how the classification is underpinned. Nosologists consult nationally and internationally to resolve issues in the classification and are viewed as experts who can not only code, but design and deliver education, assist in the development of the classification and the rules for using it.\n\nNosologists are usually expert in more than one classification, including morbidity, mortality and casemix. In some countries the term \"nosologist\" is used as a catch-all term for all levels.\n\nClinical coders may use many different classifications, which fall into two main groupings: statistical classifications and nomenclatures.\n\nA statistical classification, such as ICD-10 or DSM-5, will bring together similar clinical concepts, and group them into one category. This allows the number of categories to be limited so that the classification does not become too big, but still allows statistical analysis. An example of this is in ICD-10 at code I47.1. The code title (or rubric) is Supraventricular tachycardia. However, there are several other clinical concepts that are also classified here. Amongst them are paroxysmal atrial tachycardia, paroxysmal junctional tachycardia, auricular tachycardia and nodal tachycardia.\n\nWith a nomenclature, for example SNOMED CT, there is a separate listing and code for every clinical concept. So, in the tachycardia example above, each type and clinical term for tachycardia would have its own code listed. This makes nomenclatures unwieldy for compiling health statistics.\n\nIn some countries, clinical coders may seek voluntary certification or accreditation through assessments conducted by professional associations, health authorities or, in some instances, universities. The options available to the coder will depend on the country, and, occasionally, even between states within a country. \n\nClinical coders start as trainees, and there are no conversion courses for coders immigrating to the United Kingdom.\n\nThe National Clinical Coding Qualification (NCCQ) is an exam for experienced coders, and is recognised by the four health agencies of the UK.\nIn England, a novice coder will complete the national standards course written by NHS Digital within 6 months of being in post. They will then start working towards the NCCQ. \n\nThree years after passing the NCCQ, two further professional qualifications are made available to the coder in the form of NHS Digital's clinical coding auditor and trainer programmes.\n\nIn 2015, National Services Scotland, in collaboration with Health Boards, launched the Certificate of Technical Competence (CTC) in Clinical Coding (Scotland). Awarded by the Institute of Health Records & Information Management (IHRIM); the aims of the certificate include supporting staff new to clinical coding, and providing a standardised framework of clinical coding training across NHS Scotland.\n\nThe NCCQ is a recognized coding qualification in Scotland.\n\nAs of 2016; the typical qualification for an entry-level medical coder in the United States is completion of a diploma or certificate, or, where they are offered, an associate degree. The diploma, certificate, or degree will usually always include an Internet-based and/or in-person internship, at some form of a medical office or facility, at the conclusion. Some form of on-the-job training, or at least oversight, is also usually provided in the first months on the job, until the coder can earn an intermediate or advanced level of certification and accumulate time on the job. For further academic training, a baccalaureate or master's degree in medical information technology, or a related field, can be earned by those who wish to advance to a supervisory or academic role. That option would be recommended for those wishing to teach medical billing or coding at a college or university, community college, or technical or vocational institute, or who wish to become heads of medical billing and coding departments, especially if the doctor's office or clinic, or other facility (among other working options, a medical school or hospital, a skilled nursing facility or other nursing home, a psychiatric facility, an assisted or independent living facility, a rehabilitation facility, a rest home or domiciliary or boarding house, etc.) is very large and receives complex cases, such as a referral facility or a Level I trauma teaching hospital center. A nosologist (medical coding expert) in the U.S. will usually be certified by either AHIMA or the AAPC (often both) at their highest level of certification and specialty inpatient and/or outpatient certification (pediatrics, obstetrics/gynecology, gerontology, oncology are among those offered by AHIMA and/or the AAPC), have at least 3-5 years of intermediate experience beyond entry-level certification and employment, and often holds an associate, bachelor's, or graduate degree. \n\nThe AAPC offers the following entry-level certifications in the U.S.: Certified Professional Coder (CPC); which tests on most areas of medical coding, and also the Certified Inpatient Coder (CIC) and Certified Outpatient Coder (COC). Also in the American Health Information Management Association (AHIMA) offers the entry-level Certified Coding Associate (CCA); which is, like the AAPC's CPC, a wide-ranging introductory test. \n\nSome U.S. states, though decidedly not the majority, as it is a very recent trend, now mandate or at least strongly encourage certification or a degree from a college- or at the minimum, some evidence of competency beyond the record of on the job training- and/or from either the AAPC or AHIMA, to be employed. Some states have registries of medical coders, though these can be voluntary listings- which is, for those few who do, most often the case- and so not mandatory. This trend was accelerated in part by the passage of HIPAA (which enforces among other things, patient privacy and access to and the form of medical records) and the Affordable Care Act (U.S. President Barack Obama's health care reform law); and similar changes in other developed and developing countries, many of which, especially in the Western developed countries, and beyond, use the ICD-10 for diagnostic medical coding, which is a quite complex system of codes. The change to more regulation and training has also been driven by the need to create accurate, detailed, and secure medical records- especially patient charts, bills, and claim form submissions, that can be recorded efficiently in an electronic era of medical records where they need to be carefully shared between different providers or institutions of care, which was encouraged and later required by legislation and institutional policy.\n\nIn many countries clinical coders are accommodated for by both professional bodies specific to coding, and organisations who represent the health information management profession as a whole.\n\n\n\n\nIHRIM are the awarding body for the National Clinical Coding Qualification (NCCQ).\n\nThere are several associations that medical coders in the United States may join, including:\n\nThe AHIMA and AAPC societies' accredited programs will generally train medical coders at a sufficient level to work in their respective states. Some medical coders elect to be certified by both societies. \n\nAHIMA maintains a list of accredited medical coding certificate (and health information management associate, bachelor's, and graduate programs, through a link on the AHIMA accredited programs page, to CAHIIM) here.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "31360509", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=31360509", "title": "Epidemiology of schizophrenia", "text": "Epidemiology of schizophrenia\n\nSchizophrenia affects around 0.3–0.7% of people at some point in their life, or 21 million people worldwide as of 2011 (about one of every 285). By using precise methods in its diagnosis and a large, representative population, schizophrenia seems to occur with relative consistency over time during the last half-century.\n\nWhile it is claimed that schizophrenia occurs at similar rates worldwide, its prevalence and incidence varies across the world, within countries, and at the local and neighborhood level. It causes approximately 1% of worldwide disability-adjusted life years (DALYs). The rate of schizophrenia varies up to threefold depending on how it is defined.\n\nSchizophrenia is diagnosed 1.4 times more frequently in males than females, and typically appears earlier in men—the peak ages of onset are 20–28 years for males and 26–32 years for females. Onset in childhood is much rarer, as is onset in middle- or old age.\n\nGenerally, the mean age of first hospital admission for treatment of schizophrenia is between 25 and 35. Studies have suggested that lower income individuals tend to have their disorder diagnosed later after the onset of symptoms, relative to those of better economic standings. As a result, the lower social classes are more likely to be living with their illness untreated.\n\nIt is generally accepted that women tend to present with schizophrenia anywhere between 4–10 years after their male counterparts. However, using broad criteria for diagnosing schizophrenia shows that males have a bimodal age of onset, with peaks at 21.4 years and 39.2 years old, while females have a trimodal age of onset with peaks at 22.4, 36.6, and 61.5 years old.\n\nThis additional post-menopausal peak of late-onset schizophrenia in women calls into question the etiology of the disease and raises a debate about \"subtypes\" of schizophrenia, with men and women being susceptible to different types (see Causes of Schizophrenia). This is further supported by the variability in presentation of the disease between the genders.\n\nOther theories that may explain this difference include protective or predisposing factors in men or women that may render them more (or less) susceptible to the disease at different points in life. For example, estrogen may be a protective factor for women, as estradiol has been found to be effective in treating schizophrenia when added to antipsychotic therapy.\n\nIn 2000, the World Health Organization found the prevalence and incidence of schizophrenia to be roughly similar around the world, with age-standardized prevalence per 100,000 ranging from 343 in Africa to 544 in Japan and Oceania for men and from 378 in Africa to 527 in Southeastern Europe for women.\n\nHowever, the impact of schizophrenia tends to be highest in Oceania, the Middle East, and East Asia, while the nations of Australia, Japan, the United States, and most of Europe typically have low impact. Despite relative geographical proximity, the DALY rate of schizophrenia in Indonesia nearly doubles that of Australia (the nations with the highest and lowest respective DALY rates). Discrepancies between DALY rates and prevalence may arise from differences in availability of medical treatment: years lived with mental disorders carry significantly higher DALY values when unmedicated than when medicated.\n\nThe following tables record the age-standardised disability-adjusted life years rates per 100,000 inhabitants (recorded in 2004).\nIn 2010, there were approximately 397,200 hospitalizations for schizophrenia in the United States. About 88,600 (22.3%) were readmitted within 30 days.\n\n"}
{"id": "26322963", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=26322963", "title": "European Immunization Week", "text": "European Immunization Week\n\nEuropean Immunization Week (EIW) is an annual regional initiative, coordinated by the World Health Organization Regional Office for Europe (WHO/Europe), to promote immunization against vaccine-preventable diseases. EIW activities are carried out by participating WHO/Europe member states. In the past these have included: disseminating informational materials about immunization, organizing immunization campaigns, organizing training sessions for health care workers, arranging workshops or conferences with political decision makers to discuss immunization, and holding press conferences about immunization-related issues.\nEIW takes place each year in April. The initiative has spread from the Americas and Europe to become a global immunization effort known as World Immunization Week. The initiative promotes the message that immunization of every child is vital in order to prevent diseases and protect life. The EIW slogan is: \"Prevent. Protect. Immunize.\"\n\nAs stated by WHO/Europe, the goal of EIW is threefold: to increase vaccination coverage across the European Region by raising public awareness about the benefits of immunization; to support national immunization systems; and to provide a framework for mobilizing public and political support for immunization efforts. Partner organizations involved in EIW include, but are not limited to, UNICEF, the Measles Initiative and the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC).\n\nThe first EIW was conducted in October 2005 by the WHO/Europe and a number of Member States across the Region. The European Immunization Week (EIW) is an annual initiative to raise awareness, improve communication and advocate immunization across the WHO European Region.\n\nEIW started out of a concern that immunization is becoming less valued because of the decline in the incidence of, and reduced fear of infectious diseases. Consequently, the coverage rates have declined in many countries across the WHO European Region; this has resulted in large, sporadic disease outbreaks. Average coverage rates vary greatly between Member States, however vulnerable groups exist all over the Region. This reduction in coverage rates have been influenced by media scares and groups/individuals opposed to immunization. Also, immunization often suffers from low political commitment due to competing health priorities.\n\nEIW has the goal to increase vaccination coverage by drawing attention to increasing awareness of the importance of every child’s need and right to be protected from vaccine preventable diseases. This initiative targets parents and caregivers, health care professionals and policy makers; with a special focus is placed on activities targeting vulnerable groups.1p2r90 e91r3 2oqjwr 7awplp12oi61[2140=-1 qdi12eoAI WEEN0Q\n\nEIW 2016 will take place in 24–30 April 2016. EIW 2016 will highlight progress being made towards elimination of measles and rubella, while also pointing to the remaining gap between those who are protected and those who sadly remain vulnerable to these diseases.\n\nImmunization has saved more lives than any other public health intervention, yet 2013 saw 31 685 measles cases alone in Europe, an increase of 348% compared to 2007. The cost of these outbreaks in both human and monetary terms is extremely high. To move closer to WHO’s vision of a European Region free of vaccine-preventable diseases, a new and innovative approach is needed, as set out in the European Vaccine Action Plan 2015–2020 (EVAP).\n\nEIW 2015 marked the 10th European Immunization Week, which took place on 20–25 April 2015. It highlighted examples of innovative practice in Member States, where new policies and initiatives addressed the key factors affecting immunization decisions: complacency, confidence, convenience and access. Communication and advocacy activities celebrated the progress achieved so far- particularly towards elimination of measles and rubella, maintaining the Region’s polio-free status, and introduction of new vaccines. It also focused on what immediate action needed to be taken to maintain commitment and achieve the Region’s ambitious immunization goals.Narrative Report: European Immunization Week 2015.\n\nEIW 2014 took place on 22–26 April 2014. It highlighted the need for and protection provided by vaccination in infancy, childhood, adolescence, adulthood, parenthood and old age. Activities organized at national and local level throughout the European Region raised awareness among health care workers, policy-makers, parents, grandparents and other individuals of the benefits of full immunization. A summary of activities that took place is available on the WHO/Europe website. Narrative report: European Immunization Week 2014.\n\nEIW 2013 took place on 22–27 April 2013. In addition to awareness-raising activities organized by individual Member States, a series of guest bloggers contributed to the EIW campaign site and information materials were published on the Immunization Resource Centre of the WHO/Europe website. Crown Princess Mary of Denmark, patron of the WHO Regional Office for Europe, made a video statement in support of European Immunization Week and World Immunization Week. The EIW 2013 Narrative Report provides a summary of EIW 2013 activities.\n\nEIW 2012 took place on 21–27 April 2012. This year, marked the first time that all 53 Member States in the WHO European Region took part simultaneously, hosting a large array of immunization awareness activities. This marked a milestone in the initiative’s seven-year history. Such widespread support was particularly critical for the Region as Member States work to eliminate measles and rubella by 2015 and to maintain Europe’s polio-free status. The vital role of health workers, as the most trusted source of information about vaccines, was also in focus.\n\nEIW 2011 took place on 23–30 April 2011. This year theme highlighted the importance of collaborating and sharing both experiences and solutions for achieving immunization goals, such as eliminating measles by 2015, maintaining the polio-free status of the Region and keeping all vaccine-preventable diseases under control in the European Region. The theme was selected in the wake of polio outbreaks in the European Region in 2010. The outbreaks have clearly illustrated that when vaccine-preventable diseases spread; shared borders lead to common threats. Therefore, one of the best ways to combat these threats is by sharing responsibility for immunization, particularly on a sub-regional level. Of the 53 Member States in the WHO European Region, 52 participated in European Immunization Week 2011. The Regional launch of the initiative was attended by Princess Mathilde of Belgium in her first year acting as Special Representative for Immunization for the WHO Regional Office for Europe.<ref name=\"WHO/Europe website\">EIW 2011 regional launch</ref>\n\nEuropean Immunization Week was initiated in 2005 with six pilot countries. In 2009 had the participation of 36 countries in the WHO European Region and featured an animated YouTube video that was viewed more than 10,000 times in a two-week period. By 2010, 47 countries in the WHO European Region participated.<ref name=\"WHO/Europe website, EIW 2010 page\">WHO/Europe website</ref>\n\nCrown Princess Mary of Denmark is the patron of the WHO Regional Office for Europe and, as such, has participated in activities related to European Immunization Week. She became Patron of WHO/Europe in 2005. In 2006 she described her commitment to public health issues in the WHO European Region, and her plans to focus on specific areas of WHO/Europe’s work to generate greater awareness in Europe, where poor health, suffering and lack of access to basic medical services were an everyday reality for many. At the launch of EIW 2008, she stated, “It is the right of every child to grow up healthy, and vaccinated against those diseases that can so easily be controlled. I hope that the countries within the region will act quickly and effectively to ensure that children and adults, especially those in vulnerable and hard-to-reach groups, have access to immunization and basic health services.” \n\nIn September 2012, Princess Mary participated for the first time in a WHO Regional Committee session outside Copenhagen, Denmark where she emphasized her commitment to immunization and maternal and child health within the framework of the Millennium Development Goals. In April 2013 she made a video statement in support of European Immunization Week and World Immunization Week. In 2014 on World Polio Day, Princess Mary and Ms Zsuzsanna Jakab, WHO Regional Director for Europe, visited Tajikistan. Princess Mary commended both the Government of Tajikistan and WHO on their collaboration and continuing efforts to improve reproductive, maternal, newborn, child and adolescent health in the country. In 2015, she made a statement promoting immunization and encouraging the Region to immunize, advocate, and generally contribute to achieving immunity for all.\n\n"}
{"id": "10810", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=10810", "title": "Fantasy (psychology)", "text": "Fantasy (psychology)\n\nFantasy in a psychological sense refers to two different possible aspects of the mind, the conscious, and the unconscious. In the unconscious sense, it is sometimes spelled \"phantasy\".\n\nA fantasy is a situation imagined by an individual that expresses certain desires or aims on the part of its creator. Fantasies sometimes involve situations that are highly unlikely; or they may be quite realistic. Fantasies can also be sexual in nature. Another, more basic meaning of fantasy is something which is not 'real,' as in perceived explicitly by any of the senses, but exists as an imagined situation of object to subject.\n\nIn everyday life, individuals often find their thoughts pursue a series of fantasies concerning things they wish they could do or wish they had done...fantasies of control or of sovereign choice...daydreams'.\n\nGeorge Eman Vaillant in his study of defence mechanisms took as a central example of 'an immature defence...\"fantasy\" — living in a \"Walter Mitty\" dream world where you imagine you are successful and popular, instead of making real efforts to make friends and succeed at a job'. Fantasy, when pushed to the extreme, is a common trait of narcissistic personality disorder; and certainly 'Vaillant found that not one person who used fantasy a lot had any close friends'.\n\nOther researchers and theorists find that fantasy has beneficial elements — providing 'small regressions and compensatory wish fulfilments which are recuperative in effect'. Research by Deirdre Barrett reports that people differ radically in the vividness, as well as frequency of fantasy, and that those who have the most elaborately developed fantasy life are often the people who make productive use of their imaginations in art, literature, or by being especially creative and innovative in more traditional professions.\n\nFor Freud, a fantasy is constructed around multiple, often repressed wishes, and employs disguise to mask and mark the very defensive processes by which desire is enacted. The subject's desire to maintain distance from the repressed wish and simultaneously experience it opens up a type of third person syntax allowing for multiple entry into the fantasy. Therefore, in fantasy, vision is multiplied—it becomes possible to see from more than one position at the same time, to see oneself and to see oneself seeing oneself, to divide vision and dislocate subjectivity. This radical omission of the “I” position creates space for all those processes that depend upon such a center, including not only identification but also the field and organization of vision itself.\n\nFor Freud, sexuality is linked from the very beginning to an object of fantasy. However, “the object to be rediscovered is not the lost object, but its substitute by displacement; the lost object is the object of self-preservation, of hunger, and the object one seeks to re-find in sexuality is an object displaced in relation to that first object.” This initial scene of fantasy is created out of the frustrated infants’ deflection away from the instinctual need for milk and nourishment towards a phantasmization of the mothers’ breast, which is in close proximity to the instinctual need. Now bodily pleasure is derived from the sucking of the mother's breast itself. The mouth that was the original source of nourishment is now the mouth that takes pleasure in its own sucking. This substitution of the breast for milk and the breast for a phantasmic scene represents a further level of mediation which is increasingly psychic. The child cannot experience the pleasure of milk without the psychic re-inscription of the scene in the mind. “The finding of an object is in fact a re-finding of it.” It is in the movement and constant restaging away from the instinct that desire is constituted and mobilized.\n\nA similarly positive view of fantasy was taken by Sigmund Freud who considered fantasy () a defence mechanism. He considered that men and women \"cannot subsist on the scanty satisfaction which they can extort from reality. 'We simply cannot do without auxiliary constructions,' as Theodor Fontane once said ... [without] dwelling on imaginary wish fulfillments.\" As childhood adaptation to the reality principle developed, so too 'one species of thought activity was split off; it was kept free from reality-testing and remained subordinated to the pleasure principle alone. This activity is \"fantasying\"...continued as \"day-dreaming\". He compared such phantasising to the way a 'nature reserve preserves its original state where everything...including what is useless and even what is noxious, can grow and proliferate there as it pleases'.\n\nDaydreams for Freud were thus a valuable resource. \"These day-dreams are cathected with a large amount of interest; they are carefully cherished by the subject and usually concealed with a great deal of sensitivity ... such phantasies may be unconscious just as well as conscious.\" He considered \"These phantasies include a great deal of the true constitutional essence of the subject's personality\" and that the energetic man \"is one who succeeds by his efforts in turning his wishful phantasies into reality,\" whereas the artist \"can transform his phantasies into artistic creations instead of into symptoms ... the doom of neurosis.\"\n\nIn the context of occurrences of the mental disorder known as schizophrenia, individuals who exhibit symptoms fulfilling this particular classification might be experiencing fantasies as part of the diagnosis (Shneidman, E. S. 1948). Scientific investigation into activity of the so-called default network within the brain (Randy Buckner et al. 2008) has shown individuals diagnosed with schizophrenia have high levels (\"...overactive...\") of activity within their brains.\n\nIn a study of eighty individuals diagnosed with schizophrenia, it was found one quarter of men who had committed a contact crime against women were motivated by sexually orientated fantasy (A.D. Smith 2008).\n\nMelanie Klein extended Freud's concept of fantasy to cover the developing child's relationship to a world of internal objects. In her thought, this kind of 'play activity inside the person is known as \"unconscious fantasy\". And these phantasies are often very violent and aggressive. They are different from ordinary day-dreams or \"fantasies\" (spelled with an \"f\")'.\n\nThe term \"fantasy\" became a central issue with the development of the Kleinian group as a distinctive strand within the British Psycho-Analytical Society, and was at the heart of the so-called Controversial discussions of the wartime years. 'A paper by Susan Isaacs (1952) on \"The nature and function of Phantasy\"...has been generally accepted by the Klein group in London as a fundamental statement of their position'. As a defining feature, 'Kleinian psychoanalysts regard the unconscious as made up of phantasies of relations with objects. These are thought of as primary and innate, and as the mental representations of instincts...the psychological equivalents in the mind of defence mechanisms'.\n\nIsaacs considered that 'Unconscious phantasies exert a continuous influence throughout life, both in normal and neurotic people, the difference lying in the specific character of the dominant phantasies'; Most schools of psychoanalytic thought would now accept that 'Both in analysis and life, we perceive reality through a veil of unconscious fantasy'. Isaacs however claimed that 'Freud's \"hallucinatory wish-fulfilment\" and his..\"introjection\" and \"projection\" are the basis of the fantasy life'; and how far unconscious fantasy was a genuine development of Freud's ideas, how far it represented the formation of a new psychoanalytic paradigm, is perhaps the key question of the Controversial discussions.\n\nLacan engaged from early on with 'the phantasies revealed by Melanie Klein...the \"imago\" of the mother...this shadow of the \"bad internal objects\"' — with the Imaginary. Increasingly, however, it was Freud's idea of fantasy as a kind of 'screen-memory, representing something of more importance with which it was in some way connected' that was for him of greater importance. Lacan came to believe that 'the phantasy is never anything more than the screen that conceals something quite primary, something determinate in the function of repetition'.\n\nPhantasies thus both link to and block off the individual's unconscious, his kernel or real core: ' \"subject and real are to be situated on either side of the split, in the resistance of the phantasy\" ', which thus comes close to the centre of the individual's personality and its splits and conflicts. 'The subject situates himself as determined by the phantasy...whether in the dream or in any of the more or less well-developed forms of day-dreaming'; and as a rule 'a subject's fantasies are close variations on a single theme...the \"fundamental fantasy\"...minimizing the variations in meaning which might otherwise cause a problem for desire'.\n\nThe goal of therapy thus became ' \"la traversee du fantasme\", the crossing over, traversal, or traversing of the fundamental fantasy'. For Lacan, 'The traversing of fantasy involves the subject's assumption of a new position with respect to the Other as language and the Other as desire...a utopian moment beyond neurosis'. The question he was left with was 'What, then, does he who has passed through the experience...who has traversed the radical phantasy...become?'.\n\nThe postmodern intersubjectivity of the 21st century has seen a new interest in fantasy as a form of interpersonal communication. Here, we are told, 'We need to go beyond the pleasure principle, the reality principle, and repetition compulsion to...the \"fantasy principle\" ' - 'not, as Freud did, reduce fantasies to wishes...[but consider] all other imaginable emotions'; and thus envisage emotional fantasies as a possible means of moving beyond stereotypes to more nuanced forms of personal and social relating.\n\nSuch a perspective 'sees emotions as central to developing fantasies about each other that are not determined by collective \"typifications\"'.\n\nTwo characteristics of someone with narcissistic personality disorder are:\n\n"}

The principal goal of the network is to promote the translation of genome-based science and technology into improvements in population health.\n\nOne of GRaPH-Int's key features is the integration of knowledge from a range of disciplines, such as genome-based science, population sciences, the humanities and social sciences. The ‘Int’ underscores the interdisciplinarity of the collaboration, but also signifies that it is international and integrated.\n\nThe mission of the Genome-based Research and Population Health International Network (GRaPH-Int) is to promote an international collaboration that facilitates the responsible and effective integration of genome-based knowledge and technologies into public policies, programmes, and services for improving population health.\n\nModern research in genetics and molecular biology, boosted by information emerging from the Human Genome Project, offers new opportunities for the promotion of population health. Anticipated benefits include more effective population-based public health disease prevention and control activities; population screening and predictive genetic testing for common multi-factorial diseases; and targeted populations-based interventions.\n\nHowever, mining the genome-based information for potential benefits and ensuring that they are effectively implemented, with appropriate attention to avoiding harm, has proven to be an enormous task. A new field within public health, called public health genomics has evolved which addresses these issues.\n\nA meeting of experts was convened in Bellagio Italy in 2005 with funding from the Rockefeller Foundation to address the tasks involved in deriving public health benefit from this vast array of new knowledge. The delegates saw the need for an international network, which would promote the goals of public health genomics. Based on discussions of the challenges involved, they developed the framework and priorities of the Genome-based Research and Population Health International Network (GRaPH-Int). The Bellagio group defined GRaPH-Int as a network of individuals who are interested in the impact of the interaction between genes and the environment on population health \n\nFollowing the Bellagio meeting, The GRaPH-Int website was launched at the 4th International DNA Sampling Conference - Montreal, June 2006.\n\nGRaPH-Int aims to establish itself as an international network that promotes the goals of public health, engages international experts, and shares knowledge and resources.

Between 2010 and 2014, health care spending increased from $1,705 per capita to $2,062 per capita. Cyprus has a multi-payer health care system that consists of a public and private sector. The public sector is funded by payroll, earnings taxes, and employer contributions. The public sector healthcare provides social insurance for the employed, self-employed, and for several types of civil servant.\n\nThe current dual sector system is in the process of being replaced with a National Health System that aims to provide universal coverage. The National Health System is estimated to save €292 million from 2016-2025 compared to the predicted expenditures of the current system. The public health sector managed by the Ministry of Health provided free services to approximately 83% of the population. Public coverage includes dental, mental health and pharmaceutical services, as well as general public health resources.\n\nThe three government bills and regulations introducing the national health system, Gesy, were agreed by parliament on 16th June 2017. Is is to be fully operational by July 1, 2020.\n\nIn 2013 Cyprus decided to establish a national health care system, with support from creditors of the International Monetary Fund, European Central Bank, and European Commission. The National Health System is predicted to increase coordination, reduce waste, and be more fiscally responsible. Inefficiencies in the system include overlapping services between the public and private health service providers and “poor communication and coordination” between the sectors. Cyprus ranks the highest among European Union nations on out-of-pocket health spending. Public healthcare operates with the state’s Ministry of Health providing control and funding. Cyprus outperforms the EU average of dentists per capita (91 for every 100,000 people) and underperforms in pharmacists per capita (21 for every 100,000 people).\n\nGeorge Pamporidis, the Minister of Health, announced in September 2015 that he intended to establish a National Health Service by 2017.

Between 1992 and 2003, spending on health care and the ratio of hospital beds to population both decreased by nearly 50 percent, and Russian emigration in that decade deprived the health system of many practitioners. In 2004 Uzbekistan had 53 hospital beds per 10,000 population. Basic medical supplies such as disposable needles, anesthetics, and antibiotics are in very short supply. Although all citizens nominally are entitled to free health care, in the post-Soviet era bribery has become a common way to bypass the slow and limited service of the state system. In the early 2000s, policy has focused on improving primary health care facilities and cutting the cost of inpatient facilities. The state budget for 2006 allotted 11.1 percent to health expenditures, compared with 10.9 percent in 2005.\n\nAmong the most common diseases are those associated with polluted drinking water: typhoid, hepatitis, dysentery, cholera, and various types of cancer. The chief causes of death are, in order of frequency, disorders of the cardiovascular, respiratory, and digestive systems and infectious and parasitic diseases. The reported incidence of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) has increased sharply beginning in 2002, partly because of a new government reporting policy and partly because of increased drug abuse In 2005 about 5,600 cases of HIV were known, after 2,000 new cases appeared in 2004. At least two-thirds of cases have been linked with drug abuse. The geographic centers of the HIV cases are Tashkent and Surkhandarya Province on the Afghanistan border.

Kennedy's tour of the Mississippi Delta\n\nSenator Joseph S. Clark's and Senator Robert F. Kennedy's tour of the Mississippi Delta occurred on April 10, 1967. At the behest of civil rights lawyer Marian Wright, Clark and Kennedy, together with two other Senators, traveled to Mississippi to investigate reports of extreme poverty and starvation. Following a field hearing, they drove from Greenville to Clarkesdale, stopping and touring impoverished communities as they went. Deeply disturbed by what they saw, the senators returned to Washington D.C. and began pushing for a series of reforms to alleviate the situation. Extensive media coverage of the event exposed the American public to real instances of malnutrition and starvation. The country was shocked and hunger became an important topic nationwide as people began looking for solutions. Efforts by the government and political action groups ultimately resulted in the problem being largely reduced by the 1970s.\n\nIn 1967, the majority of legislative program supporting the United States government's \"War on Poverty\" was due to expire. In an attempt to generate national interest in renewing funding for the effort, the United States Senate Committee on Labor's Subcommittee on Poverty held a series of hearings related to hunger, starting March 15. One of first the testifying witnesses was Marian Wright, a 27-year-old Yale Law School graduate working with the NAACP's Legal Defense Fund in Mississippi. She told the subcommittee that increased mechanization and requirements that cotton fields lie fallow under federal subsidy stipulations had put thousands of black sharecroppers out of work in the Mississippi Delta. In addition to this, two-parent families were ineligible for many welfare benefits, and most counties in Mississippi had switched welfare programs from one that distributed surplus food to an alternative that required a monthly purchase of food stamps. With little to no income, most households could not produce the necessary funds. As a result, Wright argued, Mississippians were \"starving. They're starving, and those who can get the bus fare to go north are trying to go north... I wish that [the senators] would have a chance to go and just look at the empty cupboards in the Delta and the number of people who are going around and begging just to feed their children.\"\n\nChairman Joseph S. Clark suggested that the subcommittee travel to Mississippi to verify Wright's testimony. Of the subcommittee's nine members, Senators Robert F. Kennedy, Jacob Javits, George Murphy agreed to the idea and accompanied him. Kennedy dispatched his aide Peter Edelman to get an advanced view on the situation. Edelman spoke extensively with Wright, whom he would marry 15 months later.\n\nThe subcommittee members flew into Jackson on April 9. That evening the senators dined with prominent Mississippians, including Oscar Carr and Charles Evers. Carr later described Kennedy as \"a very shy man\" who \"continuously asked questions.\" Evers said \"We talked and talked and he listened.\" Local civil rights activist Amzie Moore acted as Kennedy's host.\n\nA field hearing was scheduled for April 10. Mississippi Senator John Stennis, a staunch segregationist, was scheduled to be interviewed. He disapproved of the federal efforts to improve the economic situation of black people and sought to discredit them by attacking the Head Start program's parent agency, the Child Development Group of Mississippi (CDGM). The Head Start project provided services to impoverished children and was funded with grants from the federal government, thereby preventing state authorities from interfering with its activities. By potentially improving the socioeconomic status of black Mississippians, Head Start threatened the political power base that dominated the state. Just days after money for the program had been appropriated, Stennis and state officials began scrutinizing it and requesting financial records. In the days before Stennis' scheduled testimony Jackson's two newspapers, both supportive of segregation, ran several stories about the senator's planned critique. Upon the poverty subcommittee's arrival in the city, Chairman Clark announced that he considered questions concerning Head Start and funding irregularities to already be answered and that the hearing would not spend significant time discussing the issue. Stennis responded by leaking his draft testimony to the press.\n\nThe subcommittee hearing took place in the Olympic Ballroom of Hotel Heidelberg in Jackson. It was originally supposed to take place in a room meant to accommodate 300 persons, but the subcommittee relocated after local media attention stirred enough interest to bring the crowd to about 1,000 people. In his opening remarks, Clark stated that the hearing intended to be \"neither a witch hunt or a whitewash. We are here to find out the basic facts.\" Stennis was called as the first witness. He admitted that there was poverty in his state, but posited that federal anti-poverty programs were overrunning expected costs and that he wished to support taxpayers. He then declared that the federal government had bypassed \"responsible, honest, capable local leadership\" and in favor of northerners and as a result its offices had become \"a stake hold of beatniks and immorality\". He requested that the governor be empowered to suspend \"any project he determines not in the public interest\" and finished by highlighting the fact that $500,000–$650,000 dollars worth of CDGM's funds were proclaimed by a government audit to be unaccounted for.\n\nClark then allowed members of the subcommittee to question Stennis. Kennedy presented a private report conducted by a New York-based firm at the behest of the college that hosted CDGM. According to the new audit, the amount of wasted funds was deemed to be \"relatively minor\" and no evidence was found to substantiate the government's allegation. Stennis was flustered and declared that the Senate Committee on Appropriations of which he was a member should have been informed of the conflicting calculations. He concluded, \"It's another illustration of the mysterious way in which this independent agency operates,\" thanked the committee for their time, and left the hotel. Testimony was then given about conditions in the Delta from both public officials and local impoverished inhabitants. A black doctor stated that the state suffered from a high infant mortality rate, and that the rate was twice as high for black babies. He added that the mortality rate of black babies from early childhood illnesses was five times greater than that for white infants. Head Start workers testified that older children they had examined displayed symptoms of anemia and other nutritional deficiencies. It was also stated that the decline in demand for agriculture labor increased unemployment, and that many of the adults were unskilled, did not have access to adequate transportation or training programs, or faced racial discrimination in their work. Robert Ezelle, former chairman of the Jackson Chamber of Commerce, asserted that the greatest problem afflicting Mississippi was its dysfunctional education system. He stated that 200,000 adults (out of the total 2 million) had not received schooling beyond the fourth grade and that a further 40,000 had never had any education.\n\nCivil rights activist Unita Blackwell defended the Head Start program, saying it was the only anti-poverty initiative that addressed the locals' problems. When quested by Kennedy about hunger, she stated that there was a problem with hunger in her county and that the shift from surplus food aid to the stamp program had worsened the situation. Wright spoke once more, asserting, \"After two civil rights bills and the third year of the poverty bill, the...Negro in Mississippi is poorer than he was, he has less housing, he is badly educated; he is almost in despair.\" Kennedy took his greatest interest in the locals' statements. Afterwards, he told Evers, \"I want to see it.\"\n\nThe following day Kennedy and Clark drove into the Delta area, while the other senators flew back to Washington D.C. They were accompanied by Evers, Wright, Moore, Edelman, Carr, a dozen or so reporters from state and national newspapers and the Big Three television networks, and an assortment of U.S. Marshals, state highway patrolmen, and local police. That morning the senators reviewed anti-poverty programs underway in Greenville and a nearby tent city that had been established by striking farm workers. After lunch, Kennedy's and Clark's motorcade traveled at speeds over 80 mph down U.S. Route 61 to visit locations specifically selected by Wright and Moore.\n\nTheir first stop was a dilapidated shotgun house in Cleveland, in which 15 people resided. Holes were present in the flooring and roofing, and the only food in the refrigerator was a jar of peanut butter. One boy told Kennedy that all he had for breakfast and dinner was molasses, and that he didn't eat any lunch. Walking to the next house, Kennedy whispered to Edelman, \"I've been to third-world countries and I've never seen anything like this.\"\n\nThe following home belonged to a mother of seven. There were no tables or cutlery in the house, and the toilet operated without plumbing. Roaches and rats ran across the floor. Kennedy's attention was drawn to a 20-month-old boy who was playing with rice grains on the floor. The child was covered in sores and bloated from hunger. Kennedy knelt down and stroked his cheek. He said, \"My God, I didn't know this kind of thing existed. How can a country like this allow it? Maybe they just don't know.\" Clark labeled what lay before them a \"national disgrace.\" Kennedy caressed the child and talked to him, but elicited no response. The senator began to cry. Kennedy stepped outside and quietly remarked, \"We spend $75 billion a year on armaments and $3 billion a year on dogs. We have to do more for these children that didn't ask to be born into this.\" Local newspaper editor Cliff Langford, who strongly disliked Kennedy, shouted back that the two senators were being brainwashed. Clark retorted, \"Don't worry. We've been brainwashed from the other side.\" Langford added, \"I don't know of anybody starving down here.\" Kennedy responded, \"Step over here and I'll introduce you to some.\" Clark reassured the reporters that he and Kennedy were not observing conditions in the Delta to \"find fault,\" but rather \"just to see if we can do anything about it.\"\n\nThe senators' motorcade continued on towards Clarksdale, but Kennedy asked that they stop in the small town of Mound Bayou. With no advanced notice, Kennedy, his aides, and half a dozen reporters walked into the home of a 39-year-old man named Andrew Jackson, his wife, and their six kids. There was no electricity, running water, or toilet. There were two pictures in the house; one of the Glorybound Singers (a Clarksdale-based Gospel group) and another of John F. Kennedy. Jackson was incredulous that he was meeting the brother of the late president and asked, \"Is you really Mr. Bobby Kennedy?\" Kennedy smiled and shook his hand, replying, \"Yes. And are you really Mr. Andrew Jackson?\"\n\nA thousand people—mostly black school children—awaited the senators outside the Clarksdale Neighborhood Center. The two stayed in the city for only 20 minutes; Clark climbed on top of a car to announce that their planned press conference was canceled, as their flight in Memphis was due to take off in two hours for the capital and he was \"going to catch that plane.\" Meanwhile, Kennedy had mounted another vehicle and gave a short speech to the crowd. He said he was glad to have made the trip, and told them, \"The problems of poverty are problems of all United States citizens.\" He was shortly thereafter engulfed by people wanting handshakes and autographs, though police soon cleared the way and the motorcade continued onto the highway.\n\nKennedy returned to Washington D.C. on the evening of April 10. He walked in on his family having dinner at Hickory Hill, highly agitated and, in the words of his daughter Kathleen, \"ashen faced.\" He announced to his children, \"In Mississippi a whole family lives in a shack the size of this room. The children are covered with sores and their tummies stick out because they have no food. Do you know how lucky you are? Do you \"know\" how \"lucky\" you are? Do something for your country.\"\n\nThe following morning Kennedy and Edelman met with Secretary of Agriculture Orville Freeman, and angrily criticized the food stamp program for charging families that had no income. Though Freeman was keen to avoiding a political dispute with Kennedy, he feared that by concurring with the senator he would anger the Southern bloc in Congress that held great influence over his department's budget. He deflected, \"Bob, there isn't anyone in America who has no income.\" Kennedy replied, \"I'll tell you what. I'll send Peter [Edelman] here back down there with some of your people... Will you agree that you'll change the regulations if your people are convinced there really are people in Mississippi who have no income?\" Freeman agreed, and was eventually persuaded by incoming evidence to open up access to food stamps. Returning to New York on April 12, Kennedy exclaimed to the wife of one of his aides, \"You don't know what I saw! I have done nothing in my life! Everything I have done was a waste! Everything I have done was worthless!\" When asked about the Poverty Subcommittee's findings, Clark said that more resources needed to be allocated to the War on Poverty. He also said that the United States needed a \"reawakening of a conscience.\" The entire subcommittee sent a letter to President Lyndon B. Johnson about their discoveries and the findings of the Department of Agriculture officials who had been dispatched to the Delta, writing about \"conditions of malnutrition and widespread hunger...that can only be described as shocking\" and imploring federal government to declare an emergency. Johnson never responded.\n\nSeveral Johnson administration officials, in addition to Freeman, were skeptical of the reports of starvation in the Delta. Johnson had seen the news coverage of the event and on April 17 he ordered that his top domestic aide, Joseph Califano, give him a \"quick report.\" Califano replied 20 minutes later, writing that Freeman was hesitant to make major changes to the administration's food stamp program until the original system was sanctioned by Congress. When his aides unanimously approved of an extensive relief plan, Johnson, already uneasy about the food stamp program, rejected the proposal. Kennedy made a direct appeal to Johnson involving increased subsidization of food stamps and the supplement of emergency food rations for 40,000–60,000 of the most impoverished Mississippians. Johnson ignored it, a decision an editorial in \"The Nation\" claimed was due to the fact that he was \"incapable of rising above personal politics.\" Once news of the situation in the Delta went public, Mississippi Governor Paul B. Johnson Jr. dismissed the report as the product of \"Socialist-minded senators.\" He also told journalist Bill Minor, \"all the Negroes I've seen around here are so fat they shine.\" Following the publication in June of a particularly severe report compiled by the Field Foundation of New York, Governor Johnson quietly commissioned a statewide study about children's nutrition. Its findings concurred with those of the Field Foundation.\n\nOn July 11 and July 12, Clark held another set of congressional hearings on hunger in the Delta to pressure Freeman, attracting widespread media coverage. The hearings were tense with Clark, Kennedy, Javits, and testifying medical observers frequently clashing with Mississippi Senators Stennis and James Eastland (also a staunch segregationist), and Mississippi Board of Health officer A. L. Gray. Kennedy called child psychologist Robert Coles to testify on poverty's effect on children in the Mississippi Delta. One North Carolina doctor described \"an unwritten policy on the part of those who control the State to eliminate the Negro Mississippian either by driving him out of the State or starving him to death.\" When Stennis and Eastland accused the doctor of committing libel against the welfare workers of their state, he invited them and other state officials to go see conditions for themselves, to which none accepted. On the second day of proceedings Secretary Freeman and Senator Javits got into a shouting match, with the senator arguing that the secretary should disregard local authorities' opinions, declare an emergency, and immediately supply food to the region. He remarked, \"We seem to be able to send airplanes to the Congo in a terrible hurry. We first heard of the desperation point of poor Mississippi Negroes 18 months ago[...]and we are still hearing that there is starvation in Mississippi.\" Kennedy openly expressed his frustration with Johnson administration officials' perceived inability to understand the extent of the Delta's problems and other bureaucratic complications, saying, \"It seems to me we are floundering around a great deal.\"\n\nIn the end, Kennedy managed to amend the renewal of the Economic Opportunity Act of 1964 to include provisions for a national survey on nutrition. Stennis was so embarrassed by the hearings that he proposed a $10 million emergency fund be established for food and medical services. Despite resistance from other Southern legislators and a lack of support from President Johnson, Stennis' bill passed. The Senate also voted unanimously to create a Select Committee on Nutrition and Human Needs. Kennedy subsequently embarked on more \"poverty tours\" to investigate and publicize impoverished conditions across the United States. He frequently invoked the Delta tour in legislative discussions and during his 1968 presidential campaign.\n\nThe media coverage from the event brought national attention to the food insecurity issues in the Delta. Most Americans were shocked by the conditions described in the area. Almost immediately, the Field Foundation of New York dispatched a team of doctors to Mississippi to examine children and verify the senators' findings. They labeled the conditions they observed a \"national disaster,\" documenting cases of Kwashiorkor, Rickets, and other signs of malnutrition and starvation. One doctor likened state of affairs to the worst he had seen in eastern Kenya. This countered initial public reactions of disbelief at the severity of the situation. The Citizens Crusade Against Poverty, an advocacy group already studying the problems in the Delta, quickly created a \"Citizens' Board of Inquiry into Hunger and Malnutrition in the United States.\" In April 1968, the board published a report of its findings, entitled \"Hunger U.S.A.\". This was shortly followed by a critique of the National School Lunch Program by a coalition of women's organizations.\n\nIn conversation with Wright and Edelemen, Kennedy remarked, \"The only way there's going to be change is if it's more uncomfortable for Congress not to act than it is for them to act...You've got to get a whole lot of poor people who just come to Washington and stay here until[...]Congress gets really embarrassed and they have to act.\" The following week Wright proposed the idea to Martin Luther King Jr., who subsequently organized the Poor People's March on Washington. Around the same time CBS broadcast a major documentary, \"Hunger in America\", which had been made on the suggestion of Kennedy to television executive Don Hewitt.\n\nThe trip to the Mississippi Delta made hunger a public issue of interest in the United States. Following the revelations of food insecurity, a powerful anti-hunger movement emerged in the country and worked to reform food assistance programs while proposing new ones. Federal expenditures on food assistance grew by 500 percent over the next decade. Marian Wright would later say that the episode \"set in motion a chain of events that culminated in years later in the virtual elimination of hunger in America during the Nixon years.\"\n\nThe Mississippi Delta tour was featured in the 1980s American civil rights documentary series, \"Eyes on the Prize\". In May 1997, Democratic Senator Paul Wellstone, inspired by the original trip, visited the Delta to bring attention to \"race and gender and poverty and children in America.\" From July 11 until July 12, 2017, Wright led local activists and politicians on a bus tour of the region to observe the 50th anniversary of the event. It was followed by a panel discussion on poverty, hunger, and healthcare in the Mississippi.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "38298022", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=38298022", "title": "Lindsay Sandiford", "text": "Lindsay Sandiford\n\nLindsay June Sandiford (born 25 June 1956) is a former legal secretary and convicted drug smuggler from Redcar, Teesside in North Yorkshire, England who was sentenced to death in January 2013 by a court in Indonesia after being found guilty of smuggling cocaine into Bali. Although death is the maximum punishment for drugs-related offences under Indonesian law, the severity of the sentence was greeted with shock because prosecutors had not recommended the death penalty for Sandiford. The ruling was also condemned by the British government and anti–death penalty campaigners.\n\nSandiford was arrested on 19 May 2012 after arriving at the island's Ngurah Rai International Airport on a flight from Bangkok when a routine luggage search uncovered the drugs stash. Under subsequent police interrogation she claimed to have been coerced into carrying the drugs by a criminal gang that had made threats against her family, and took part in a sting operation to arrest several other individuals she alleged to be part of a drugs trafficking ring.\n\nIn December 2012, she was convicted of drug smuggling at Denpasar District Court and sentenced to death by firing squad in January 2013. By contrast, the others involved in the case were convicted of lesser drugs-related offences and received custodial sentences. Prosecutors had recommended Sandiford should also receive a custodial sentence because of her willingness to cooperate with police, but the panel of judges overseeing the hearing felt her actions had undermined Indonesia's anti-drugs policy and concluded there were no mitigating circumstances in her favour.\n\nSandiford subsequently launched an appeal against the court's decision. She had funded her own defence costs during the initial trial but had no money for representation at appeal. Funds were subsequently raised to pay for an appeal lawyer, and the appeals procedure began. In the United Kingdom lawyers applied to seek a judicial review of the government's stance of not providing financial aid for Britons facing criminal proceedings overseas, but their legal challenge was dismissed by judges at the High Court of England and Wales on the grounds that Sandiford had little chance in successfully appealing the sentence. An appeal arguing the government's position was unlawful was also rejected. The British government submitted a statement to the Court in Bali alleging unlawful behaviour towards Sandiford by officials at the time of her arrest. The High Court in Bali rejected the first stage of Sandiford's appeal in April 2013, upholding the death sentence. An appeal was subsequently lodged with the country's Supreme Court, but in August this was also rejected.\n\nSandiford was raised in the north-eastern town of Redcar, Teesside in North Yorkshire, before moving to London. She later lived in Cheltenham, Gloucestershire. A former legal secretary, she worked for many years in management at the Cheltenham-based law firm DTS Legal. She rented a house in the town, but was evicted after failing to pay her rent, and in early 2012 moved to live in India. Sandiford was married but separated, the relationship having produced two children.\n\nSandiford was arrested on 19 May 2012 after arriving at Bali's Ngurah Rai International Airport on a Thai Airways flight from Bangkok, Thailand, when 4.8 kg (10.6 lb) of cocaine was found in the lining of her suitcase during a routine search. She claimed to have been forced into carrying the drugs by a gang who had threatened to harm members of her family if she did not comply with their demands. When informed she could receive the death penalty for drug trafficking she broke down and told police that she had been asked to carry the drugs for Julian Ponder, a British antiques dealer living in Bali, and his partner Rachel Dougall, and agreed to help in a sting operation to arrest them. Sandiford was booked into a hotel with an undercover police officer, where she went about contacting members of the alleged syndicate. Arrangements were made for her to meet Ponder, and another man, Paul Beales at the hotel, where police arrested them on suspicion of drug trafficking. Dougall was arrested after a subsequent search of the property she shared with Ponder uncovered 48.94 grammes of cocaine, while 3.1 grammes of hashish were found at Beale's house. Sandiford and Ponder were charged with drug trafficking. However, police failed to find evidence linking the other two to the crime, and they were charged with less serious offences.\n\nAt her trial prosecutors alleged that Sandiford met Dougall and Beales at a hotel in Bangkok on 17 May 2012, where arrangements were made for her to courier the cocaine into Bali. She arrived on the island two days later. In her defence, Sandiford claimed that she had been pressured into carrying the drugs by a gang who had made threats against her children, while her lawyers argued she was suffering from mental health problems. In a statement to the court she expressed regret over her involvement, \"I would like to begin by apologising to the Republic of Indonesia and the Indonesian people for my involvement. I would never have become involved in something like this but the lives of my children were in danger and I felt I had to protect them.\" Her son gave a statement to the court in which he said he believed she was forced to carry the drugs following a disagreement over rent money she had paid on his behalf. A report by Dr. Jennifer Fleetwood, a lecturer in criminology at the University of Kent and expert on women in the international drugs trade was also presented to the court, suggesting Sandiford was an ideal target for drug traffickers. \"There is … evidence to suggest that a trafficker would seek someone who was vulnerable. Having reviewed extracts from Lindsay's medical records I know that Lindsay has a history of mental health issues … This may have unfortunately made her an attractive target for threats, manipulation and coercion.\"\n\nSandiford was convicted on 19 December, with a recommendation from prosecutors that she be spared the death penalty – the maximum punishment for drug trafficking under Indonesian law – because of her age and cooperation with police, and instead receive a 15-year custodial sentence. On the same day, Rachel Dougall was found guilty of failing to report a crime, while Paul Beales was convicted of possessing hashish. They later received one year and four-year prison sentences respectively. Julian Ponder was cleared of drug smuggling, but convicted of the possession of narcotics in January 2013, and sentenced to six years' imprisonment.\n\nDespite the prosecution's recommendation of leniency, at her sentencing hearing on 22 January 2013 a panel of judges ruled there were no mitigating circumstances in Sandiford's favour, and imposed a death sentence. Amser Simanjuntak, who headed the panel said Sandiford's actions had damaged Bali's reputation as a tourist destination and undermined Indonesia's fight against drugs, while his colleague, Komang Wijaya Adi said their decision had been influenced by several factors, including what was viewed as her lack of remorse. The sentence was greeted with gasps from around the courtroom. In Indonesia an execution is generally carried out by firing squad, often at night in an isolated location. Following the judgment Sandiford was led from the court in a distressed state, where she declined to speak to journalists before being escorted away by guards to be held at Bali's notorious Kerobokan Prison. Her lawyers announced she would appeal, a process that can take several years under Indonesian law.\n\nIn response to the sentence the British embassy in Indonesia said the United Kingdom \"remains strongly opposed to the death penalty in all circumstances\" and that it was in touch with the UK government to discuss how best to provide Sandiford with legal representation. In a statement to the House of Commons, Hugo Swire, Minister of State for the Foreign Office expressed his concern about the decision. \"We are aware that Lindsay Sandiford is facing the death penalty in Indonesia. We strongly object to the death penalty and continue to provide consular assistance to Lindsay and her family during this difficult time.\" He also said that Foreign Secretary William Hague had raised the matter with his Indonesian counterpart.\n\nMartin Horwood, MP for Cheltenham, Sandiford's most recent UK residence, expressed his shock at the sentence. \"The days of the death penalty ought to be past. This is not the way that a country that now values democracy and human rights should really be behaving.\" The sentence was also condemned by the anti–death penalty charity Reprieve, which has taken up her case. The organisation's Harriet McCulloch said, \"She is clearly not a drug king pin - she has no money to pay for a lawyer, for the travel costs of defence witnesses or even for essentials like food and water. She has cooperated fully with the Indonesian authorities but has been sentenced to death while the gang operating in the UK, Thailand and Indonesia remain free to target other vulnerable people.\" Tim Hancock, Campaigns Director of Amnesty International UK also criticised the sentence. \"It is extremely sad to hear that judges have decided to give Lindsay Sandiford a death sentence – despite the fact that the prosecution weren't even asking for it. She is the second British citizen sentenced to death for drug offences in the last six months – an extremely worrying trend.\"\n\nAt the time Sandiford was sentenced to death no executions had been carried out by Indonesia since 2008. On 4 February 2013 the country's attorney general, Basrief Arief, signalled his intention to resume executions by shortening the length of the appeals process, which he believed had delayed them. The country resumed executing condemned prisoners on 15 March, when a Malawian drug trafficker, Adami Wilson, was executed by firing squad in the early hours of the morning. On 12 April Amser Simanjuntak, the judge who sentenced Sandiford to death, was found dead at his home, having suffered a fatal heart attack.\n\nSandiford had seven days to lodge an appeal following the sentence. An initial letter of appeal drafted by diplomats was rejected by court officials because guidelines require an appeal to be filed from the prison. On 28 January Gede Ketut Rantam, registrar of Denpasar District Court in Bali confirmed his office had received an appeal request from Sandiford. She was then given a further fourteen days to file a more detailed appeal. The appellate system of Indonesia has three levels; the High Court, the Supreme Court, and a direct appeal for clemency to the President.\n\nHer financial resources had been exhausted by legal costs during her trial, and consular staff identified an Indonesian lawyer who was willing to represent her on a pro bono basis at appeal, but who required expenses of £2,500 to travel to Bali. On 1 February Teesside's \"Evening Gazette\" reported that £3,500 had been collectively pledged by donors to accounts established on online donation sites Justgiving and Indiegogo to pay for her legal fees. On 4 February the \"Gazette\" reported that the money had been used to hire a lawyer, while a Reprieve official was working in Bali to help file the appeal. Sandiford's lawyer, Fadillah Agus, lodged an appeal with the Indonesian High Court on 11 February. He argued that Sandiford's sentence did not take into account her cooperation with police.\n\nIn February 2013 the Foreign and Commonwealth Office submitted an \"amicus curiae\" to Denpasar District Court alleging that police had used sleep deprivation on Sandiford and threatened her with a firearm following her arrest, and consequently \"violated Lindsay Sandiford's fundamental rights under international laws and the Indonesian constitution\". The document also argued her punishment was disproportionate to the crime she committed, and did not take into account her cooperation with authorities. The British consulate in Bali also submitted a statement to the court expressing the country's objection to the death penalty.\n\nBali's High Court announced on 8 April 2013 that Sandiford's appeal had been denied and her conviction and death sentence upheld. The Court ruled the original sentence was \"accurate and correct,\" and gave her 14 days to lodge an appeal with the Indonesian Supreme Court. Agus announced on 19 April that an appeal would be lodged within the next few days. On 23 April notice was given by Sandiford's lawyer to the Supreme Court that she would challenge the sentence.\n\nOn 7 May 2013, Sandiford appealed against her sentence to the Indonesian Supreme Court. On 30 August, the Supreme Court rejected her appeal. Sandiford is able to lodge a judicial review if new evidence is presented or if there was negligence in the case.\n\nSandiford applied for a presidential pardon in December 2014. In 2015 she recruited Indonesian lawyers for an attempt to seek a retrial on her behalf. No date had been set for her execution as of August 2017. In February 2018 she was still in Kerobokan Prison on Bali.\n\nOn the day Sandiford lodged her preliminary appeal the London-based law firm Leigh Day which is working with Reprieve on her behalf said it would seek a judicial review of the UK government's position that it does not provide funds for the legal representation of British nationals facing criminal proceedings overseas. Reprieve believed that by not providing Sandiford, a British citizen, with financial help to cover her legal costs the government had breached its obligations towards her. The legal challenge was heard at the High Court before Mrs Justice Gloster and Mrs Justice Nicola Davies on 31 January, but the case was dismissed. The judges ruled that Sandiford had \"no reasonable prospect of success\", remarks that attracted criticism from anti–death penalty campaigners.\n\nSandiford appealed against this decision, but it was again rejected at the High Court in April 2013, by a three-judge panel, chaired by Master of the Rolls Lord Dyson. By then Sandiford's first line of appeal against her death sentence had been rejected, and she required £6,000 towards her legal costs for the next stage of her appeal. In his summing up on 22 April Lord Dyson said that it was \"most unfortunate\" Sandiford required \"relatively speaking ... [a] very small sum indeed\" for her legal costs, but that this \"cannot affect the principle that we have had to consider and it cannot affect our decision. It may be that other means may be found to secure the relatively small sum in the course of the next few days.\" The judges published their reasons for rejecting the appeal on 22 May. In the written judgement, Lord Dyson said that Sandiford had argued the Foreign Secretary's position was \"unlawful\" but that the High Court had been \"right to conclude\" it was not. \"As the Secretary of State concedes, it would be possible to produce a policy under which funds for legal representation were made available to British nationals in certain defined circumstances...But the question is not whether the Secretary of State could produce a different policy which many would regard as fairer and more reasonable and humane than the present policy. It is whether the policy that he has produced is irrational. I am in no doubt that the policy is not irrational. It is based on reasoning which is coherent and which is neither arbitrary nor perverse.\"\n\nIn a written interview with BBC Radio 5 Live presenter Victoria Derbyshire shortly after the UK appeal was rejected, Sandiford said that the Foreign Office's stance was \"tantamount to condoning the death penalty\" and claimed she was receiving little support from them. \"The government and FCO are doing all they can to resist me at this difficult time.\"\n"}

It is a quantitative and subjective method of measuring the size of a strabismic deviation by dissociation of the eyes brought about by two septa which are placed in such a way as to present fields to either eye separated by a diaphragm at the centre. The right eye sees a red and white arrow, each of which point to a scale with numbers seen by the left eye; the red arrow points to the vertical red scale and the white arrow points to the horizontal white scale. A third arrow located to the right and below the horizontal white scale is used to measure torsion\n\nThe Maddox Wing measures the size of heterophorias (latent deviations) and small heterotropias (manifest deviations) at near when normal retinal correspondence (NRC) is present. It is especially helpful when patients present with symptoms of diplopia (double vision) with no apparent cause. Unsuspected torsional deviations may also be revealed where there are no symptoms present. It is a quick and convenient method of measuring the size of a deviation and is generally used in association with a number of other tests before a full diagnosis is determined.\n\nThe Handle:\n\nThe handle is retractable and is located at the base of the instrument. This is where the patient holds the apparatus.\n\nThe Eye Piece:\n\nLocated anteriorly, the eye piece is where the patient looks into.\n\nThe Eye-piece lens holder:\n\nMainly used to hold lens for patients who have difficulties seeing the board with their glasses\n\nThe Septa:\n\nThere are 2 septa that separates the eye piece so that the patient has two separate fields of view.\n\nThe Scale Card:\n\nUsed to measure the deviation of heterophorias, small heterotropias (with NRC) and also torsion. The scale card has the horizontal, vertical and torsional scales. The board also contains the red and white arrows. This will be further discuss throughout the video.\n\nThe Torsion Lever:\n\nOn the measuring board there is an adjustable lever which the patient subjectively aligns to measure torsion.\n\nThe Maddox Wing test is performed at near with the instrument held in reading position, slightly inferior (approximately 15° depression and 33 cm away). The room or location of the test should be brightly illuminated and the patient's optical correction (e.g. glasses, bifocals, multifocals, contact lens) is required to be worn. In the event that correction cannot be worn due to the obstruction of vision through the eye piece, lenses may be placed within the lens holder before each eye. The examiner instructs the patient to hold the Maddox Wing and identify the number that the white (vertical arrow) and red (horizontal arrow) arrows point to on their respective scales.\n\nExample instructions and examiner questions:\n\nExample:\n\nKey:\nWith the maddox wing, you cannot differentiate between a manifest deviation or latent deviation. The white arrow on the white X-Axis measures for horizontal deviations in which, odd numbers represent eso deviations and even numbers represents exo deviations. The red arrow on the red Y-Axis measures for vertical deviations; odd numbers represent right hyper deviations and even numbers represents left hyper deviations. In the absence of a deviated eye, both red and white arrows point to zero, indicating that there is no deviation present. The presence of torsion is determined subjectively; the patient is instructed to take hold of the torsion lever and make it straight.\n\n\n\n\n"}

English-speaking Québécois follow the modern French use of the term entrée to refer to a dish served before the main course.\n\nAccording to linguist Dan Jurafsky, North American usage (\"entrée\") retains the original French meaning of a substantial meat course.\n\nThe main dish is usually the heaviest, heartiest, and most complex or substantial dish on a menu.

Reforms in the sphere of medical care and direction of health care system are parts of a global strategic development program of economic and social infrastructure. This program is based on principles of establishment of high life democratic society with market economy.\n\nHistory of medicine in Azerbaijan has deep roots. Ancient people believed in sorcery for struggle against various sicknesses. Carvings and painted signs in Azykh Cave dated from the Stone Age evidence about it.\nEarly people used medicinal plants for treatment of different sicknesses. Their experience has developed and became a traditional medicine. Development of oral and written branches of traditional medicine was dividing with origination of writing.\n\nRich flora of Azerbaijan attracted attention of doctors and scientists from ancient times. A lot of medicinal plants were used for prophylaxis and treatment. Seeds, roots, flowers and leaves of these plants were used in treatment. Women easily observed the influence fruits, vegetables and medicinal tea upon organism and their influence upon cough, bleeding, ache, diarrhea and other illnesses.\n\nFrom ancient manuscripts it is known that they used not only plants, but were also acquainted with surgery, treatment of tumors and setting of broken bones. For instance, Nariman Narimanov found a human skull dated from the 4th millennium BC (Eneolithic) with traces of trepanning on it, in Erefli village of Agdam Rayon. In 1971, archeologist H.Kesemenli found out a skull dated from the late Bronze and early Iron Ages on which a trepanation was performed, in Khachbulag village of Dashkasan Rayon. R.Gasimova, who investigated the skull, said that “artificial trepanation was performed near junction of parietal and frontal bones”.\n\nIn 1958, pitchers dated from the 6th century BC with burned rues which were used as medicine for treatment of rheumatism, fever and prophylactics of various illnesses, were found out in Garakepektepe village of Mugan plain during archeological excavations.\n\nAromatherapy was also broadly spread. It was believed that smell of a quince strengthens body’s energy. Lemon was used for adjusting of nervous system, and apple for stimulation of brain’s work.\n\nIn ancient times there was an active cultural interchange between Azerbaijanis and residents of Mesopotamia. Sesame oil and crocus were imported from Sumer. There is information about medicinal drugs and medicine in Avesta, a sacred book of fire worshippers and the ancient monument of people of Azerbaijan and Iran. There is also written that “a doctor has three weapons: word, herbs and a knife”. A doctor curing by words and suggestion was considered as the best at that time.\n\nMedicine of Caucasian Albania, descendants of which are considered Azerbaijanis, was also developing. Medicinal plants were planted there from the Roman Empire. Works by Hippocrates and Claudius Galenus were popular there because of spreading of Christianity and Greek language. Some knowledge about medicine was taught in religious schools and churches.\n\nIn this period medicine was quickly developing which is evidenced by archeological findings. For instance, polished marble vessels for antimony and golden brushes for applying it, which was used as anti-cough and antiemetic medicine in the Middle Ages, were found out. Sick men drunk wine from these made of antimony cups. Various glass vessels used for preparation and storage of medicines, which were used by alchemists both in traditional medicine and pharmacology, were found out in Shamakhi during excavations. These findings confirm that people in Azerbaijan were engaged in pharmaceutics in the Middle Ages.\n\nAccording to Farid Alakbarli, a historian Turkish traditional medicine which was called “Turkachare” and was similar to shamanism and treatment by wizardry and herbs began to be spread in the 4th century AD with entering of Turkic tribes into Azerbaijan. In Turkish doctors were called gam, which meant “shaman” or otachi which meant “herbalist”. Herbals were called ota (ot is herb in translation from Turkic). Goddess \"Oleng\" was considered as the patroness of doctors.\n\nIn VIII Shirvan, where mainly Albanians and Iranians lived, was occupied by Arabs. Sciences and culture developed due to mutual influence of cultures as a part of single Caliphate. Universities, observatories, libraries, mosques and hospitals were built. Progress of medicine is observed namely in Islamic period. At that time, madrasa, where Arabic and Persian languages, religion, math, calligraphy, history and literature were taught, functioned in Azerbaijan. Medicine and alchemy were also taught there. “Malham” madrasa in Shamakhi was one of the most famous madrasa’s of that time. Eminent scientist and doctor Kafiyaddin Omar ibn Osman – uncle of eminent Persian poet Khagani Shirvani – led this educational institution.\n\nCopy of “The Canon of Medicine” work written in Arabic, in 1030, by doctor Ibn Sina, famed in Europe as “Avicenna” and who also was in Azerbaijan where he collected information about medicine, was found out in Azerbaijan among other manuscripts about medicine. In his work Ibn Sina wrote about Saburkhast settlement in Azerbaijan. This copy of “The Canon” was made in Baghdad, in 1143 and is considered one of the most ancient manuscripts in the sphere of pharmacology and medicine in the world and the most ancient in Azerbaijan, which was broadly used both in whole Muslim world and also in Christian Europe and which had a great influence upon development of medicine. There are descriptions of hundreds of medicines in it.\n\nBahmanyar al Azerbaijani (died in 1067), a student of Ibn Sina, also famed among scientists of the 11th century. Bahmanyar touched upon issues in medicine in his philosophic work called “at-Tahsil” (“Understanding”).\n\nManuscript copy of “Al-Magala as-Salasun” (“The thirteenth treatise”) written in the 13th century by Abu al-Gasim al-Zahravi, an eminent scientist from Andalusia, who famed in Europe as Abulgasis (died in 1013) also came from Azerbaijan. It is one of the most ancient manuscripts of this book. About 200 surgery instruments had been mentioned in this book. Their assignments also had been explained there. The work influenced upon development of surgery both in the East and also in Europe. Professor Ziya Bunyadov translated it into Russian and after it was published in Moscow, in 1983.\n\nMedieval doctors warned sick people against tiredness. For example, Mahmud inb Ilyas, a doctor lived in the 12th century advised nervous people to listen to mugham.\n\nMedicine was strongly developing in the 13th century in the Great Seljuq Empire of Azerbaijani Atabegs. Almost every eastern scientist and philosopher had a work in medicine. Residents from different oblasts of Azerbaijan compiled, rewrote and investigated books in medicine, including monuments of the 14th-18th centuries. There are more than four hundred manuscripts in medicine in Azerbaijani, Arabic, Persian and Turkish languages both written in the territory of modern Azerbaijan and brought from different oblasts in the Muhammad Fuzuli Institute of Manuscripts of Azerbaijan of Azerbaijan National Academy of Sciences, in Baku. According to Kōichirō Matsuura, the former Director-General of UNESCO, “this collection shows the role of Azerbaijan in development of world medicine”.\n\n“Zahirai Nizamshahi” written by Rustam Jurjani in the 13th century was also partly investigated in Azerbaijan. Its manuscript had been copied in the 16th century is saved in Baku Institute of Manuscripts. There were descriptions of pharmaceutical herbs, substances of animal origin, minerals and some difficult medicines are included into it. The manuscript hasn’t been found in any other storage of the world and exists in only exemplar in Azerbaijan.\n\n“About treatment science” work by Mahmud ibn Ilyas (the 14th century) in which fundamental ideas of medicine, symptoms and reasons of specific illnesses are described also famed.\n\nYusif Garabaghi, an Azerbaijani doctor of the 16th century, who came from Karabakh, wrote many medicine treatises and also “Explanations and interpretations of “The Canon of Medicine” by Ibn Sina”. He lived in Central Asia for a long time and taught in Samarkand.\n\nMir Muhammad Momin, palatial figure at Suleyman the Safavid, wrote several instructive works in Persian, including “Tohfat al Mominin” in 1669. Descriptions of more than 4000 plants, animals, minerals and other ingredients used in medicine were written in the work. Momin described each plant, its specific characteristic, where it can be picked, other oblasts where it is used and its name in other languages such as Chinese and Hindi in detail.\n\nIn 1712, Muhammad Yusif Shirvani wrote “Tibbname” in Azerbaijani language. Being a palatial doctor, Shirvani advised to use natural minerals for treatment, for example, rubbing of orange peel while tiredness in neck. In this work it’s also written that resting place of sick men should be decorated with flowers in light-blue, green and white tints. It means that even the color had a great importance in works of medieval healers.\n\nGenerally, in the 17th-18th centuries, number of works had been written in the sphere of medicine and pharmacology by Azerbaijani scientists such as Murtuzagulu Shamlu (sexual pathologist), Abdulhasan Maraghai, pharmacologists such as Hasan Rza oglu Shirvani, Haji Suleyman Iravani and others. 724 kinds of medicinal plants were described.\n\nIn the early 19th century when northern khanates of Azerbaijan (Shirvan, Baku, Nakhchivan, Quba, Talysh, Karabakh, Shaki, Derbend and other) were joined to Russia and the southern (Tabriz, Khoy, Ardabil and others) ones to Iran, Azerbaijani community in Iran continued to exist under the influence of Persian and generally, the whole Islamic culture, but Azerbaijani community in the Russian Empire (later the USSR) was developing under the influence of Europeanized secular Russian culture (mainly in the Soviet times). Medicine in two regions was developing in two different ways.\n\nThere wasn’t any European like pharmacy in Azerbaijan until 1828. During the reign of the Russian such hospitals and pharmacies were established in Azerbaijan as in the whole South Caucasus, where Russian doctors applied their skills.\n\nAbdulkhalig Akhundov founded basis of scientific investigation in the history of medicine in Azerbaijan. Abdulkhalig studied and translated famous pharmaceutics encyclopedia written by Abu Mansur Kharavi in the 9th century from Persian into German. After, the book was published in Germany. Abdulkhalig Akhundov also defended a dissertation in the history of medicine at the University of Tartu. In 1895, Dr.Mammad Rza Vakilov, Dr.Kerimbey Mehmandarov and others established Baku Union of Medicine.\nHasan bey Zardabi and Mirza Fatali Akhundov used knowledge in medicine in their works for expression of philosophical ideas. Akhundov was one of the firsts who acted against traditional healers. He was the author of works about hygiene and sanitary. Zardabi also had an important role in development of medicine. He was the first Azerbaijani in the sphere of natural history and Social Darwinism.\n\nBeing the author of “Akinchi” – the first Azerbaijani newspaper in the Russian Empire – Zardabi, together with Akhundov worked upon works about malaria devastated the country at that time. His “Hygiene” book is the first scientific research work about medicine in the sphere of hygiene in Azerbaijan. It was published in 1914, in Azerbaijan.\n\nSometimes doctors gave gratuitous help to sick men. During cholera devastation in Nakhchivan, in 1847, Mirza Nasrulla Mirza Ali oglu gratuitously treated both Azerbaijani and Armenian sick men, due to which he was respected among people.\nAlongside all these, pharmacies where herbs imported from Iran and India were sold, were also functioning at that time. Such pharmacies were in every city of Azerbaijan – Baku, Shamakhi, Shusha, Agdam, Nakhchivan, Lahij, Ordubad, Salyan, Lankaran etc. Mir-Baba Mir-Abdulla oglu, father of eminent Azerbaijani literary man Yusif Vazir Chamanzaminli had a pharmacy in Aghdam. 142 kinds of medicines, more than 100 of which were made of herbs, were sold in his pharmacy. Chamanzaminli himself, being the son of the pharmacist, described everyday life and practices of Azerbaijani healers of the 19th century in his narrative called “The Doctor”.\n\nSuch pharmacies were mainly in Iranian (Southern) Azerbaijan. At the beginning of the 20th century treatment by herbs was enough spread method of treatment in Azerbaijan. But healers perceived appearance of new, modern medicines as something strange.\n\n“Molla Nasraddin” – popular Azerbaijani magazine of that time, which was of great importance in medicine education, criticized such kinds of remains of the past, ridiculed backwardness of healers-evils of that time, their ignorant treatment of modern knowledge in medicine. For instance, a caricature called “Holy Bukhara” (painted by Azim Azimzade) was given in the 20th issue of the magazine (1911). Here the image of Bukhara emir, doubtfully treating recommendations of the doctor about a new medicine.\n\nIn 1918, Ministry of health-care led by Dr.Rafiyev was established in independent Azerbaijan Democratic Republic. Dozens of new pharmacies and hospitals were opened in Baku and Ganja at that time.\nMany students of Azerbaijan Democratic Republic sent for educating abroad, mainly to Germany, Saint Petersburg, Moscow, Kiev and other cities, learned medicine there.\n\nIn 1919, Baku State University with a medicine faculty was established in Baku. Professor V.I.Razumovskiy, an eminent surgeon, became its first chairman (until 1920). History of medicine was also taught there. Razumovskiy established the First Preparatory Commission for a short period of time. Admission examinations were held in August of the same year and so the first course of students – future doctors – was collected.\n\nOn August 2, 1922 there were only three Azerbaijanis – A.Alakbarov, Jeyran Sultanova and Adliya Shahtakhtinskaya-Babayeva, who became the Doctor of Sciences and Professor – among the first 29 alumni of medicine faculty.\n\nAfter establishment of the Soviet Power, during the 1920s, pharmacies where herbs were sold were closed, and manuscripts written with Arabic alphabet were burned. It was a part of the Soviet Power’s policy carried out against Islam (mainly in Azerbaijan and Central Asia).\n\nNariman Narimanov, who also was a doctor, was the leader of a newly established administration. From 1920 to 1921 Aghahuseyn Kazimov and then in 1935 Mir Movsum Gadirly were national commissars of health-care in the Azerbaijan SSR.\n\nIn 1930, Azerbaijan State Medical Institute was established and M.N.Gadirly was its first rector. Eminent scientists and professors such as I.Shirokorogov, S.Davidenkov, F.Ilyin, Lev Levin, N.Ushinkiy, k.Malinovskiy and others had a great contribution on development of the institute. Scientists such as M.Mirgasimov, M.A.Topchubashov, A.M.Aliyev, I.M.Ismayilzade and others graduated from this institute, who then brought Azerbaijani medical science fame.\n\nGenerally, from 1920 to 1940 hundreds of polyclinics, hospitals and pharmacies were established in Azerbaijan. Academicians such as Mirasadulla Mirgasimov and Mustafa Topchubashov, and professors such as Alibey Alibeyov, Kamil Balakishiyev and others were world-famous scientists and doctors of Azerbaijan.\n\nIn the first years of independence, the situation in healthcare was very bad in Azerbaijan. Government could keep the healthcare system standing just with support of international organizations.The necessary medical equipment, lack of medicine was great problem.\n\nNew stage in development of medicine began after Azerbaijan acquired independence. More than 10 laws were established in the sphere of health-care. In March 1998, Heydar Aliyev, former president of Azerbaijan, signed a direction “About establishment of State Committee of reforms in the sphere of health-care”. Unique state policy was established in the country and quality of medical service of the population was also improved.As soon as healthcare programs which were included repair and rehabilitation of medical institutions, providing them with equipment, provision and treatment of citizens with free medicines and preparations, diagnostic centers in the regions, in particular coverage of children with all medical services were accepted. Today medical centers and modern pharmaceutics industry of Azerbaijan is created at a level of world standards. A national plan against illnesses such as HIV/AIDS and tuberculosis is developed in the country. In 2001, a direction about celebration of June 17 as a holiday of health-care employers was signed. In 2004, Azerbaijani Association of Medicine Historians which was included into International Union of the History of Medicine headquartered in Paris, in 2005, was established. The First National Conference of the Association was held on February 1–2 of the same year in Baku. In recent years Heydar Aliyev Foundation has launched a number of projects on treatment of diabetes, thalassemia, blood donation campaigns, and the protection of maternal and child health.\n\nAbout 870 private medical companies and 2,300 pharmaceutical organizations operate in Azerbaijan. Health system in modern Azerbaijan includes mainly primary healthcare, outpatient and inpatient services. \n\nIn 2012-2013, 11 priority healthcare programs with total amount of 387.7 million manat were implemented in the country. In 2013 the amount of funds allocated to the healthcare system from the state budget has been increased 11 times compared to 2003. On the basis of this growth, up to 500 healthcare facilities were created or renewed. The range of the most important medicine supply has been increased from 60 to 166. Over the past 10 years, the mortality rates have decreased; the natural population grows increased.\n\nWithin the framework of the \"Health Month\" disease prevention campaign organized by the Ministry of Health in December in 2012 under the slogan \"For a Healthy Life” medical institutions that carry out prophylactic examinations have been provided with the necessary equipment and reagents, 3 million patients were checked and treated accordingly.\n\nM. Topchubashov Scientific Surgery Center carried out open heart surgery for adults and children for the first time in these years. In the Republican Clinical Urology Hospital named after M. Javadzade kidney transplantation has been started in early 2000.\n\nIn order to treat patients with chronic renal failure, more than 2,000 patients are receiving hemodialysis sessions in 27 centers and are provided with appropriate medications.\nMeasures have been taken to improve the quality of medical services provided to mothers and children. If the infant mortality rate in the country was 16.7 in 2003. In 2013 this figure was 10.8. The maternal mortality ratio decreased from 18.5 to 14.9, compared to 2003.\n\nAccording to the Law \"On Education\", the training of physicians in the country is carried out through residency, accepted in the medical education system of most countries of the world. In 2012 about 500 doctors were admitted to residency in various specialties passing through the State Commission on Student Admission. Besides, in 2009-2012, 451 doctors and midwives have been trained in private and state clinics in foreign countries for 3-6 months.\n\nRefresher trainings were organized in Baku with the participation of specialists from different countries and 1363 participants have gained practical knowledge in these trainings.\nSince 2003, 12 relevant decisions have been established to increase the salaries of medical workers.\n\nWithin the framework of the \"Electronic Azerbaijan\" State Program \"Citizen's Electronic Health Card\" has been launched. There are currently about 10 registrars of various diseases, single registry of cadres, electronic surveillance system of infectious diseases, drug circulation, dispatching service of emergency medical station and others. The Ministry of Health has provided 38 e-services. The \"Electronic Services\" section has been created on the official website of the Ministry and there are 11 electronic services.\n\nThe Ministry of Health cooperates with about 40 countries. In addition, the Sanitation and Epidemiological Service Development Program for 2015-2020 has been developed, which took appropriate measures to prevent infectious diseases. An Action Plan covering 2013-2020 on combating non-infectious diseases (such as smoking, obesity, physical activity, alcohol abuse, etc.) and National Action Plan on Early Prevention and Treatment of Childhood Disorders (2014-2020) have been implemented.\n\nIn 2009, a new approach was introduced which seeks to define the number and type of staff needed in the system based on demographic criteria.\n\nIn July 2009, the government issued a new law on education. Within the framework of the law on education the Ministry of Health had to prepare a draft law on medical education by October 2009. The Azerbaijan Medical University is the only provider of undergraduate medical education in the country. Several unlicensed private medical schools operated in the late 1990s and early 2000s, but they all were closed by the Ministry of Education by 2005. In 2013 about 1020 medical students are enrolled annually in 8 departments. \n\nThe Department of Human Resources, Education and Science of Ministry of Health, organizing the planning of health staff, provides data on vacancies in health facilities. In accordance with data on vacancies the Ministry of Health asks the Azerbaijan Medical University to provide them with medical staff. The University sends graduates to the relevant specialty internships. The planning of nursing and midlevel healthcare personnel also follows the same process.\n\nSince February 1, 2008 governmental medical institutions show a gratuitous medical aid to population, by a direction signed by Ogtay Shirinov, a minister of health-hare of Azerbaijan. In November, 2009, Azerbaijani doctors performed the first operation in heart for prevention of arrhythmia.\n\n43 new hospitals and diagnostic centers, 46 outpatient polyclinics, 4 restoration centers for disabled persons and 12 diagnostics and health centers were put into operation during the last years. 30 medical institutions and 5 polyclinics are to be constructed in 2013. Indicators of longevity and birth rate have improved because of the development of the medicine in the country.\n\nThere are 8 nursing schools in Azerbaijan which closely cooperates with the Ministry of Health. Being a nurse does not require higher education. Candidates may become a nurse by graduating nurse trainings. Graduated nurses are presented vocational diplomas. In 2008, the total annual admission to all nursing schools was 1950. Postdiploma education for nurses is provided through three nursing schools located in Baku, Ganja and Mingechevir. Depending on the specialty, refresher trainings are required every five years. The course duration is from five days to two months. In 2008, approximately 2200 nurses completed these trainings. \n\nPhysicians should participate in refresher trainings every five years that organized by the Azerbaijan Physicians’ Advancement Institute. In 2008, more than 2700 physicians attended various refresher trainings organized by Institute. At the same time international organizes such as UNICEF, UNFPA, WHO, USAID, etc. also organized and funded various trainings on maternalchild care, primary care and emergency medicine, family planning and reproductive health, primary care and public health, and others. The trainings lasted from 22 months to 30 months depending on specialty profile. \n\nPublic health services are provided by different agencies, including the Sanitary-Epidemiological Service, Public Health and Reforms Center of the Ministry of Health, the National HIV/AIDS Center and other structures. \n\nThe Sanitary Epidemiological Service defines sanitary and hygienic norms and regulations include drinking water, sanitation, living and work spaces hygiene, food hygiene such as production, distribution, storage, sale and handling of food products, occupational and environmental hygiene, and radiation hygiene. The activity of the Service also include control over state sanitary surveillance and epidemiological investigation, social-hygienic monitoring, preventing and eliminating infectious and parasitic diseases and food poisoning, planning sanitary-hygienic and anti-epidemic activities, reviewing the sanitary-epidemiological situation, controlling quality of environment, physical development of and morbidity among the population, implementing programs on health of the population. \n\nThe Sanitary Epidemiological Service consists of two structures: Sanitary Epidemiological Surveillance Inspection Service and Hygiene and Epidemiology Center. The first one controls the activity of the specialized hygiene and epidemiology centers as well as carries out implementation of state sanitary surveillance.\n\nHygiene and Epidemiology Center provides organizational-methodological supervision in about 83 district and city. The Center is responsible for the hygiene and epidemiology of water transport. \n\nSince 2006 Pharmaceutical sector operates actively. This sector is adjusted on the laws on pharmaceutical activity and products, circulation of narcotics, psychotropic substances and their precursors, establishment and activity of a pharmacy, analytical expertise center for medicines, rules for state registration of Pharmaceuticals and management of drug registry, list of over-the-counter pharmaceuticals. \n\nBetween 1996 and 2005 pharmaceuticals were registered and given license by the Department of Licensing and Medical Equipment of the Ministry of Health. In 2005 the Innovation and Supply Center was established to check the quality of medicines, as well as to ensure healthcare organizations with medicines. The Center also license pharmaceutical entities.\n\n"}

Its structure remained relatively static even when the 1938 Social Security Act was passed where the New Zealand government took a larger role in health purchasing. The department remained actively involved in policy (as opposed to purchasing).\n\nBy the 1970s problems had appeared in the health system. The high growth rate in hospital expenditure was occurring at a time when the economy was slowing down. Thus, the government was unable to sustain funding this growth.\n\nThis led the health system to undergo a series of changes over a 20-year period from the 1980s. During the 1990s the National government attempted to stream-line the system in a series of reforms such as separating the government purchasing and provision of health care services. During this time the department was renamed as the \"Ministry of Health\".\n\nThe Labour-Alliance coalition government redefined the role of the Ministry of Health as part of Labour's election promises in the 1999 election.\n\nThe separate government health service purchasing entity, the Health Funding Authority, was merged with the Ministry of Health. Critics were anxious as to how the Ministry would perform as a funder, as they commented that the Ministry had in the past only performed as a policy organisation. However, supporters of this move stated that they believed this would make these agencies more accountable.\n\nThe Ministry of Health funds public health promotions such as smoking cessation and immunisation programmes, as part of the \"New Zealand Primary Health Strategy\" will move towards funding universal access to primary care services for New Zealand citizens. In 2003 the Ministry of Health began forming Primary Health Organisations in an effort to move health care services from fee-for-service arrangements to capitation funding for health professionals who are members of these organisations.\n\nDistrict Health Boards were formed in 2001 as a subsidiary organisation of the Ministry. As of 2005, 21 different District Health Boards (DHBs) exist. These are responsible for hospitals and funding some health provisions in their respective areas . 75% of VOTE: Health goes to the \"District Health Boards\" of New Zealand. Funding for these DHBs is allocated according to the Ministry's population-based funding formula . The District Health Boards can be considered much like the board of trustees of a school, some members are elected while others are government-appointed.\n\nSo-called \"business units\" of the Ministry include:\n\n\nMedsafe carries out medical regulatory functions within the Ministry .\n\nThe Ministry serves 1 portfolio and 3 ministers.\n\n"}

It is also the name of a cross country ski race at Giant's Ridge Ski Area in Biwabik, Minnesota, an event sponsored by Pepsi.\n\nThe challenge originally took the form of a single blind taste test. At malls, shopping centers, and other public locations, a Pepsi representative sets up a table with two white cups: one containing Pepsi and one with Coca-Cola. Shoppers are encouraged to taste both colas, and then select which drink they prefer. Then the representative reveals the two bottles so the taster can see whether they preferred Coke or Pepsi. The results of the test leaned toward a consensus that Pepsi was preferred by more Americans.\n\nIn his book \"Blink: The Power of Thinking Without Thinking\" (2005), author Malcolm Gladwell presents evidence that suggests Pepsi's success over Coca-Cola in the \"Pepsi Challenge\" is a result of the flawed nature of the \"sip test\" method. His research shows that tasters will generally prefer the sweeter of two beverages based on a single sip, even if they prefer a less sweet beverage over the course of an entire can.\n\nWhen the preference in blind tests is compared to tests wherein cups are labeled with arbitrary labels (e.g., S or L) or brand names, the ratings of preference change. Scientific findings do support a perceptible difference between Coca-Cola and Pepsi, but not between Pepsi and RC Cola.\n\nIn his book, \"Bad Habits\", humorist Dave Barry describes the Pepsi challenge as, \"Pepsi’s ongoing misguided attempt to convince the general public that Coke and Pepsi are not the same thing, which of course they are.\"\n\nIn 1981, Pepsi ran a \"Pepsi Challenge Payoff\" contest that would hand out a large prize to anyone who could gather Pepsi bottle caps that spelled out the words \"Pepsi Challenge\".\n\n\n"}

It was managed under the general supervision of the Minister of Health. Before entering the operating theatre, an anaesthetic consisting of Nupercaine was administered by means of a lumbar puncture. The spinal anaesthetics had been given by Dr.Malcolm Graham. At that time, it was common practice to store such anaesthetic in glass ampoules immersed in a phenol solution to reduce the risk of infection. Unknown to the staff, the glass had a number of micro-cracks which were invisible to the eye but which allowed the phenol to penetrate. When used, the phenol-contaminated anaesthetic caused permanent paraplegia.\n\nA later analysis suggests that the most probable cause of the paralyses was an acidic descaler which, by an oversight, had been allowed to remain in the sterilizing water boiler.\n\nAs the law then stood, to find negligence proved, there must be a duty of care, the defendant must have breached that duty, and that breach must have caused the loss or damage sustained by the plaintiff. The standard of care required of defendants was judged by applying an objective test, considering what a \"reasonable man\" would or would not have done in the same situation. In \"Hall v Brooklands Auto Racing Club\" (1933) 1 KB 205, it was held that it was the duty of the operators to ensure that the racing track they had designed was as free from danger as reasonable care and skill could make it, but that they were not insurers against accidents which no reasonable diligence could foresee. Similarly, in \"Glasgow Corporation v Muir\" (1943) 2 AER 44, a defendant was not negligent in allowing a group to enter a tea room to escape bad weather, because the \"reasonable man\" would not have foreseen that these invitees would be injured (scalded) upon entering the tearoom.\n\nIn the Supreme Court of Judicature, court of appeal the learned Justices said as follows:\n\nDenning LJ. \"We must not look at the 1947 incident with 1954 spectacles.\" It was held that the micro-cracks were not foreseeable given the prevailing scientific knowledge of the time. Thus, since no reasonable anaesthetist would have stored the anaesthetic differently, it was inappropriate to hold the hospital management liable for failing to take precautions. That the profession had changed its practice in the light of experience proved that the profession was responsible in its self-regulation. In 1954, anaesthetists coloured the phenol with a dye. If a vial became contaminated, the dye showed inside the vial. These vials were then discarded. But, given that the hospital was applying the best practice of the time, there was no negligence.\n\nSomervell LJ. \"It is now clear that phenol can find its way into an ampoule of nupercaine stored in a solution of phenol through cracks which are not detectable by the ordinary visual or tactile examination which takes place in an operating theatre — these cracks were referred to in the evidence as \"invisible cracks\" — or through molecular flaws in the glass. The attention of the profession was first drawn to this risk in this country by the publication of Professor Macintosh's book on Lumbar Puncture and Spinal Anaesthesia in 1951. In 1947 the general run of competent anaesthetists would not appreciate this risk. (Dr Mcintosh, Day 3, 18, 19, 42-E; Dr Organe, Day 8, 61; Dr Cope, Day 9, 25). Dr Graham certainly did not appreciate this as a risk. I accordingly find that by the standard of knowledge to be imputed to competent anaesthetists in 1947, Dr Graham was not negligent in failing to appreciate this risk and a fortiori the theatre staff were not negligent.\"\n\nMorris LJ \"It is now known that there could be cracks not ordinarily detectable. But care has to be exercised to ensure that conduct in 1947 is only judged in the light of knowledge which then was or ought reasonably to have been possessed. In this connection the then-existing state of medical literature must be had in mind. The question arises whether Dr Graham was negligent in not adopting some different technique. I cannot think that he was\"\n\n"}

{"id": "145023", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=145023", "title": "Spray drying", "text": "Spray drying\n\nSpray drying is a method of producing a dry powder from a liquid or slurry by rapidly drying with a hot gas. This is the preferred method of drying of many thermally-sensitive materials such as foods and pharmaceuticals. A consistent particle size distribution is a reason for spray drying some industrial products such as catalysts. Air is the heated drying medium; however, if the liquid is a flammable solvent such as ethanol or the product is oxygen-sensitive then nitrogen is used.\n\nAll spray dryers use some type of atomizer or spray nozzle to disperse the liquid or slurry into a controlled drop size spray. The most common of these are rotary disk and single-fluid high pressure swirl nozzles. Atomizer wheels are known to provide broader particle size distribution, but both methods allow for consistent distribution of particle size. Alternatively, for some applications two-fluid or ultrasonic nozzles are used. Depending on the process needs, drop sizes from 10 to 500 µm can be achieved with the appropriate choices. The most common applications are in the 100 to 200 µm diameter range. The dry powder is often free-flowing.\n\nThe most common type of spray dryers are called single effect. There is a single source of drying air at the top of the chamber (see n°4 on the diagram). In most cases the air is blown in the same direction as the sprayed liquid (co-current). A fine powder is produced, but it can have poor flow and produce a lot of dust. To overcome the dust and poor flow of the powder, a new generation of spray dryers called multiple effect spray dryers have been produced. Instead of drying the liquid in one stage, drying is done through two steps: the first at the top (as per single effect) and the second with an integrated static bed at the bottom of the chamber. The bed provides a humid environment which causes smaller particles to clump, producing more uniform particle sizes, usually within the range of 100 to 300 µm. These powders are free-flowing due to the larger particle size.\n\nThe fine powders generated by the first stage drying can be recycled in continuous flow either at the top of the chamber (around the sprayed liquid) or at the bottom, inside the integrated fluidized bed.\nThe drying of the powder can be finalized on an external vibrating fluidized bed.\n\nThe hot drying gas can be passed in as a co-current, same direction as sprayed liquid atomizer, or counter-current, where the hot air flows against the flow from the atomizer. With co-current flow, particles spend less time in the system and the particle separator (typically a cyclone device). With counter-current flow, particles spend more time in the system and is usually paired with a fluidized bed system. Co-current flow generally allows the system to operate more efficiently.\n\nAlternatives to spray dryers are:\n\nA spray dryer takes a liquid stream and separates the solute or suspension as a solid and the solvent into a vapor. The solid is usually collected in a drum or cyclone. The liquid input stream is sprayed through a nozzle into a hot vapor stream and vaporized. Solids form as moisture quickly leaves the droplets. A nozzle is usually used to make the droplets as small as possible, maximizing heat transfer and the rate of water vaporization. Droplet sizes can range from 20 to 180 μm depending on the nozzle.\nThere are two main types of nozzles: high pressure single fluid nozzle (50 to 300 bars) and two-fluid nozzles: one fluid is the liquid to dry and the second is compressed gas (generally air at 1 to 7 bars).\n\nSpray dryers can dry a product very quickly compared to other methods of drying. They also turn a solution, or slurry into a dried powder in a single step, which can be advantageous as it simplifies the process and improves profit margins.\n\nIn pharmaceutical arena, spray drying is employed to manufacture Amorphous Solid Dispensation, by uniformly disperse Active Pharmaceutical Ingredients into a polymer matrix. This state will put the active compounds (drug) in a higher state of energy which in turn facilitates diffusion of drug spices in patient body.\n\nSpray drying often is used as an encapsulation technique by the food and other industries. A substance to be encapsulated (the load) and an amphipathic carrier (usually some sort of modified starch) are homogenized as a suspension in water (the slurry). The slurry is then fed into a spray drier, usually a tower heated to temperatures well over the boiling point of water.\n\nAs the slurry enters the tower, it is atomized. Partly because of the high surface tension of water and partly because of the hydrophobic/hydrophilic interactions between the amphipathic carrier, the water, and the load, the atomized slurry forms micelles. The small size of the drops (averaging 100 micrometers in diameter) results in a relatively large surface area which dries quickly. As the water dries, the carrier forms a hardened shell around the load.\n\nLoad loss is usually a function of molecular weight. That is, lighter molecules tend to boil off in larger quantities at the processing temperatures. Loss is minimized industrially by spraying into taller towers. A larger volume of air has a lower average humidity as the process proceeds. By the osmosis principle, water will be encouraged by its difference in fugacities in the vapor and liquid phases to leave the micelles and enter the air. Therefore, the same percentage of water can be dried out of the particles at lower temperatures if larger towers are used. Alternatively, the slurry can be sprayed into a partial vacuum. Since the boiling point of a solvent is the temperature at which the vapor pressure of the solvent is equal to the ambient pressure, reducing pressure in the tower has the effect of lowering the boiling point of the solvent.\n\nThe application of the spray drying encapsulation technique is to prepare \"dehydrated\" powders of substances which do not have any water to dehydrate. For example, instant drink mixes are spray dries of the various chemicals which make up the beverage. The technique was once used to remove water from food products; for instance, in the preparation of dehydrated milk. Because the milk was not being encapsulated and because spray drying causes thermal degradation, milk dehydration and similar processes have been replaced by other dehydration techniques. Skim milk powders are still widely produced using spray drying technology around the world, typically at high solids concentration for maximum drying efficiency. Thermal degradation of products can be overcome by using lower operating temperatures and larger chamber sizes for increased residence times.\n\nRecent research is now suggesting that the use of spray-drying techniques may be an alternative method for crystallization of amorphous powders during the drying process since the temperature effects on the amorphous powders may be significant depending on drying residence times.\n\nFood: milk powder, coffee, tea, eggs, cereal, spices, flavorings, blood, starch and starch derivatives, vitamins, enzymes, stevia, nutracutical, colourings, animal feed, etc.\n\nPharmaceutical: antibiotics, medical ingredients, additives\n\nIndustrial: paint pigments, ceramic materials, catalyst supports, microalgae\n\n\n"}

{"id": "18802137", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=18802137", "title": "Toothcomb", "text": "Toothcomb\n\nA toothcomb (also tooth comb or dental comb) is a dental structure found in some mammals, comprising a group of front teeth arranged in a manner that facilitates grooming, similar to a hair comb. The toothcomb occurs in lemuriform primates (which includes lemurs and lorisoids), treeshrews, colugos, hyraxes, and some African antelopes. The structures evolved independently in different types of mammals through convergent evolution and vary both in dental composition and structure. In most mammals the comb is formed by a group of teeth with fine spaces between them. The toothcombs in most mammals include incisors only, while in lemuriform primates they include incisors and canine teeth that tilt forward at the front of the lower jaw, followed by a canine-shaped first premolar. The toothcombs of colugos and hyraxes take a different form with the individual incisors being serrated, providing multiple tines per tooth.\n\nThe toothcomb is usually used for grooming. While licking the fur clean, the animal will run the toothcomb through the fur to comb it. Fine grooves or striations are usually cut into the teeth during grooming by the hair and may be seen on the sides of the teeth when viewed through a scanning electron microscope. The toothcomb is kept clean by either the tongue or, in the case of lemuriforms, the sublingua, a specialized \"under-tongue\". The toothcomb can have other functions, such as food procurement and bark gouging. Within lemuriforms, fork-marked lemurs and indriids have more robust toothcombs to support these secondary functions. In some lemurs, such as the aye-aye, the toothcomb has been lost completely and replaced with other specialized dentition.\n\nIn lemuriform primates, the toothcomb has been used by scientists in the interpretation of the evolution of lemurs and their kin. They are thought to have evolved from early adapiform primates around the Eocene or earlier. One popular hypothesis is that they evolved from European adapids, but the fossil record suggests that they evolved from an older lineage that migrated to Africa during the Paleocene (66 to 55 mya) and might have evolved from early cercamoniines from Asia. Fossil primates such as \"Djebelemur\", \"'Anchomomys' milleri\", and \"Plesiopithecus\" may have been their closest relatives. The lack of a distinct toothcomb in the fossil record before to 40 mya has created a conflict with molecular clock studies that suggest an older divergence between lemurs and lorisoids, and the existence of a ghost lineage of lemuriform primates in Africa.\n\nThe toothcomb, a special morphological arrangement of teeth in the anterior lower jaw, is best known in extant strepsirrhine primates, which include lemurs and lorisoid primates (collectively known as lemuriforms). This homologous structure is a diagnostic character that helps define this clade (related group) of primates. An analogous trait is found in the bald uakari (\"Cacajao calvus\"), a type of New World monkey.\n\nToothcombs can also be found in colugos and treeshrews, both close relatives of primates; however, the structures are different and these are considered to examples of convergent evolution. Likewise, small- or medium-sized African antelopes, such as the impala (\"Aepyceros melampus\"), have a similar structure sometimes referred to as the \"lateral dental grooming apparatus\". Living and extinct hyraxes (hyracoids) also exhibit a toothcomb, although the number of tines in the comb vary throughout the fossil record.\n\nDating to the Eocene epoch over 50 mya, \"Chriacus\" and \"Thryptacodon\"—two types of arctocyonids (primitive placental mammals)—also possessed an independently evolved toothcomb.\n\nThe toothcomb of most lemuriforms includes six finely spaced teeth, four incisors and two canine teeth that are procumbent (tilt forward) in the front of the mouth. The procumbent lower canine teeth are the same shape as the incisors located between them, but they are more robust and curve upward and inward, more so than the incisors. In the permanent dentition, the canines erupt after the incisors. The crowns of the incisors are also angled in the direction of the forward tilt, and the crowns of both the incisors and canines are elongated and compressed side-to-side. The apical ridge, following along the front edges of the toothcomb teeth, is V-shaped in most lemuriforms, tapering off from the midline. As a result of this dental reconfiguration, the upper and lower incisors do not contact one another, and often the upper incisors are reduced or lost completely.\nThe French anatomist Henri Marie Ducrotay de Blainville first identified the two lateral teeth of the lemuriform toothcomb as canines in 1840. Canine teeth are normally used to pierce or grasp objects. With modified lower canine teeth, the first lower premolars following the toothcomb are usually shaped like typical canine teeth (caniniform) and assume their function. These premolars are commonly confused with canines. Normally the true canines in the lower jaw sit in front of the upper canines, and in toothcombed primates, the caniniform premolars rest behind it.\n\nThe lemuriform toothcomb is kept clean by the sublingua or \"under-tongue\", a specialized muscular structure that acts like a toothbrush to remove hair and other debris. The sublingua can extend below the end of the tongue and is tipped with keratinized, serrated points that rake between the front teeth.\n\nAmong lemurs, the toothcomb is variable in structure. Among indriids (Indriidae), the toothcomb is less procumbent and consists of four teeth instead of six. The indriid toothcomb is more robust and wider, with shorter incisors, wider spaces between the teeth (interdental spaces), and a broader apical ridge. It is unclear whether this four-toothed toothcomb consists of two pairs of incisors or one pair of incisors and one pair of canines. In fork-marked lemurs (\"Phaner\") the toothcomb is more compressed, with significantly reduced interdental spaces. All six teeth are longer, straighter, and form a more continuous apical ridge. In the recently extinct monkey lemurs (Archaeolemuridae) and sloth lemurs (Palaeopropithecidae), the toothcomb was lost and the incisors and canines resumed a typical configuration in the front of the mouth. The aye-aye also lost its toothcomb, replacing it with continually growing (hypselodont) front teeth, similar to the incisors of rodents.\n\nIn colugos, the toothcomb has a completely different structure. Instead of individual incisors and canine teeth being finely spaced to act like the teeth of a comb, the biting edge of the four incisors have become serrated with as many as 15 tines each, while the canine acts more like a molar. These serrated incisors are kept clean using the front of the tongue, which is serrated to match the serrations of the incisors. Similarly, the hyracoid toothcomb consists of incisors with multiple tines, called \"pectinations\". In contrast to the colugos, the size and shape of the tines are more uniform.\n\nThe toothcomb of treeshrews is like the lemuriform toothcomb in that it uses interdental spaces to form the comb tines, but only two of its three pairs of lower incisors are included in the toothcomb and the canines are also excluded. The lateral two incisors in the toothcomb are generally larger. In the extinct arctocyonids, all six lower incisors were part of the toothcomb. In African antelopes, the toothcomb is strikingly similar to that of lemuriforms in that it consists of two pairs of incisors and a pair of canines.\n\nAs a homologous structure in lemuriforms, the toothcomb serves variable biological roles, despite its superficially stereotypic shape and appearance. It is primarily used as a toiletry device or grooming comb. Additionally, some species use their toothcomb for food procurement or to gouge tree bark.\n\nThe primary function of the toothcomb, grooming, was first noted by the French naturalist Georges Cuvier in 1829, who pointed out that the ring-tailed lemur (\"Lemur catta\") had lower incisors that \"sont de véritables peignes\" (\"are real combs\"). More than 100 years later, the grooming function was questioned since it was difficult to observe and the interdental spaces were thought to be too small for fur. Observations later showed the teeth were used for that purpose and that immediately after grooming, hair may be found trapped in the teeth, but is removed by the sublingua later.\n\nIn 1981, scanning electron microscopy revealed fine grooves or striations on the teeth in lemuriform toothcombs. These grooves were only found on the sides of the teeth on the concave surfaces between the sides, as well on the back ridge of the teeth. Between 10 and 20 µm wide, these grooves indicate that hair moved repeatedly across the teeth. Inside these grooves were even finer grooves, less than 1 µm, created by abrasion with the cuticular layer of the hair.\n\nAmong non-primates, the extinct \"Chriacus\" exhibits microscopic groves on its toothcomb, but the Philippine colugo (\"Cynocephalus volans\") does not. The toothcomb of the colugos is generally considered to function as a toothcomb, but due to the lack of striations on the teeth and no documented observations of toothcomb use during oral grooming, its use seems to be limited to food procurement.\n\nIn African antelopes, the lateral dental grooming apparatus does not appear to be used during grazing or browsing. Instead, it is used during grooming when the head sweeps upward in a distinctive motion. It is thought to comb the fur and remove ectoparasites.\n\nIn lemuriform primates, the toothcomb may also play a secondary role in olfaction, which may account for the size reduction of the poorly studied upper incisors. The toothcomb may provide pressure to stimulate glandular secretions which are then spread through the fur. Furthermore, the size reduction of the upper incisors may create a gap between the teeth (interincisal diastema) that connects the philtrum (a cleft in the middle of the wet nose, or rhinarium) to the vomeronasal organ in the roof of the mouth. This would allow pheromones to be more easily transferred to the vomeronasal organ.\n\nMouse lemurs (\"Microcebus\"), sifakas (\"Propithecus\"), and the indri (\"Indri\") use their toothcombs to scoop up fruit pulp. Other small lemuriforms, such as fork-marked lemurs (\"Phaner\"), the hairy-eared dwarf lemur (\"Allocebus\"), and galagos (particularly the genera \"Galago\" and \"Euoticus\") use their toothcombs to tooth-scrape plant exudates, such as gum and sap. In fork-marked lemurs, the toothcomb is specially adapted to minimize food trapment since the interdental spaces are greatly reduced. The herbivorous colugos in the genus \"Cynocephalus\" may also use their toothcomb for food procurement.\n\nIndriids such as the sifakas use their toothcombs to gouge bark or dead wood (bark-prising), which is done before scent-marking with the gland on their chest. The more robust structure of their toothcomb is thought to help it withstand the compressive forces experienced during regular bark-prising.\n\nThe origins of the lemuriform toothcomb and the clade it characterizes have been the center of considerable debate for more than a century. In 1920, British palaeoanthropologist Wilfrid Le Gros Clark proposed that the toothcomb found in treeshrews (which he believed were primates) was an early version of the dental structure found in lemuriforms. Because he viewed the fossil lorisoids from the Miocene as not having fully developed the modern lemuriform toothcomb, he implied that lemurs and lorisoids had evolved the trait independently. This view was later overturned, and the monophyletic relationship between lemurs and lorisoids is now accepted.\n\nThe ancestral condition of the anterior dentition on the lower jaw, based on Eocene primate fossils, suggests that earliest primates had lacked a differentiated toothcomb. Most fossil strepsirrhines lacked the stereotypic lemuriform toothcomb. Collectively, early strepsirrhine primates are known as adapiforms. Adapiforms are considered to be a paraphyletic group (containing many but not all of the descendants of the last common ancestor of the group's members) because the lemuriforms are assumed to have evolved from one of several groups of adapiforms. In terms of ecology, the evolution of the toothcomb is assumed to have required a folivorous (leaf-eating) diet among the ancestral adapiform population, since that would select for reduced incisors, which would serve as an exaptation (a trait with adaptive value for something other than what it was originally selected for), which could then be used for personal or social grooming. However, the inclusion of the canines into the toothcomb must have required exceptional conditions, since large lemuriforms have secondarily modified caniniform premolars to substitute for the loss.\n\nA popular hypothesis about the origins of the lemuriform clade is that they evolved from European adapiforms known as adapids. In some adapids, the crests of the lower incisors and canines align to form functional cropping unit, and the American paleontologist Philip D. Gingerich has suggested this foreshadowed the development of the lemuriform toothcomb. However, no lemuriform toothcomb has been found in the fossil record of the Eocene, and the European adapid lower jaws from that time did not resemble the derived state seen in lemuriforms.\n\nLemuriforms are currently thought to have evolved in Africa, and the earliest known strepsirrhine primates from Africa are azibiids from the early Eocene, which likely descended from a very early colonization of the Afro-Arabian land mass in the Paleocene (66 to 55 mya). Stem lemuriforms, including \"Djebelemur\" and \"'Anchomomys' milleri\", have been found in Africa and date from 50 to 48 mya and were very distinct from European adapiforms. However, they lack a toothcomb. These stem lemuriforms suggest an early common ancestry with cercamoniines from outside of Europe. Based on large, procumbent lower teeth, \"Plesiopithecus\", a fossil primate found in late Eocene deposits at the Fayum Depression in Egypt, is thought to be most closely related to lemuriforms. Together, \"Djebelemur\", \"‘Anchomomys’ milleri\", and \"Plesiopithecus\" are considered to be sister taxa (the closest relatives) of lemuriform primates.\n\nAlthough stem lemuriforms like \"Djebelemur\" may have been contemporaneous with related toothcombed primates around 50 to 48 mya, the sparse African fossil record suggests toothcomb differentiation occurred around 52 to 40 mya according to the French paleoanthropologist Marc Godinot. This would conflict with the molecular clock estimates by evolutionary anthropologist Anne Yoder and others, which predict lemur–lorisoid divergence dating between 61 and 90.8 mya.\n\nIn 2001, the discovery of \"Bugtilemur\", a fossil primate from Pakistan dating to the Oligocene and initially thought to be a cheirogaleid lemur, further challenged the theory of lemur origins; however, it was later shown to be a type of adapiform primate and not a lemur.\n\nThe minimum paleontological estimate for the divergence of lemurs and lorisoids nearly doubled when additional discoveries were made in northern Egypt during the 2000s of a stem galagid (\"Saharagalago\") and a stem or crown lorisoid (\"Karanisia\") dating to 37 and 40 mya respectively. \"Karanisia\" is the oldest fossil primate to exhibit a distinct lemuriform toothcomb. This, as well as studies of other African adapiforms like \"‘Anchomomys’ milleri\", suggests a more ancient ghost lineage for lemuriforms in Africa.\n\nThe selective pressure that shaped the original lemuriform toothcomb has been a topic of considerable debate since the 1970s. Evidence can be seen as supporting a grooming function, food procurement function, or both. In the early 1900s, there was less debate. Grooming was seen as the primary function since primates lack the claws needed to adequately comb the fur, although prosimian primates (strepsirrhines and tarsiers) possess at least one grooming claw on each foot to compensate. Grooming—in the form of fur-combing—is generally considered the primary function and original role of the lemuriform toothcomb, and subsequent changes in morphology across multiple lineages have altered its function and obscured its original function.\n\nThe hypothesis that the toothcomb evolved for food procurement was based on observations of recent lemuriform taxa, such as cheirogaleid lemurs (particularly fork-marked lemurs and the hairy-eared dwarf lemur) and galagos, which demonstrate tooth-scraping of plant exudates, as well as sifakas, which practice bark-prising. Each of these were considered \"primitive\" forms among the living strepsirrhines, suggesting the first lemuriforms exhibited similar behaviors. Also, strong selective pressure from feeding ecology placed on the anterior dentition was emphasized, based on the specialized upper anterior dentition seen in the recently extinct koala lemurs (\"Megaladapis\"). If feeding ecology could have such profound effects on the shape of the anterior dentition, then convergent evolution might explain the similarities seen between the compressed lower incisors of the lemuriform toothcomb and the exudate feeding adaptations in the genus \"Callithrix\" (a type of marmoset).\n\nIn contrast, the grooming hypothesis emphasized that all lemuriforms use their toothcombs for grooming, and long, thin teeth are poorly suited for the mechanical stress of gouging and exudate feeding. Also the interdental spaces seen in most lemuriforms favor fur combing and would also promote bacterial growth and tooth decay if used for exudate feeding. Supporting this, reduced interdental spacing is found in exudate feeding lemuriforms. Furthermore, the canine included in the toothcomb provides additional interdental spacing for fur combing. Even the behavior of young lemuriforms suggests that grooming plays a more important role in the use of the toothcomb than food procurement.\n\n\n[[Category:Hygiene]]\n[[Category:Primate anatomy]]\n[[Category:Teeth]]"}

In 2009 private companies provided water and sanitation services to 38% of the urban population of the country.\n\nAt the time of the French protectorate of Morocco beginning in 1912 the water supply of Casablanca, Rabat, Salé, Tangiers and Meknes was provided by the French private company \"Société Marocaine de Distribution d'eau, de gaz et d'électricité\" (SMD), a subsidiary of , under concession contracts. These contracts were terminated when Morocco became independent in 1956, at which time municipal public utilities became responsible for water supply and electricity distribution in the major cities of the Kingdom.\n\nCasablanca. In the early 1990s the municipal public utility \"Régie Autonome Intercommunale de Distribution d'Eau et d'Electricité de Casablanca\" (RAD) had a poor service record. Therefore, \"after the direct intervention of King Hassan\" the government decided in the mid-1990s to bring in a private company to manage the city's water, sewerage and power networks. Lyonnaise des Eaux under its CEO , a close adviser of Jacques Chirac, negotiated the contract with the Interior Ministry under Driss Basri. The lengthy negotiations process for the contract was accompanied by intense criticism from the press, the Moroccan trade association \"Confédération Générale des Entreprises du Maroc\", and city councilors. Finally a consortium led by Lyonnaise des Eaux (now SUEZ), was awarded the 30-year concession without a competitive tender. Lyonnaise des Eaux thus returned to a city where it had already provided services for almost half a century. The consortium was called Lydec and originally included Lyonnaise des Eaux (35%), Elyo (24%), Agbar (5%), EdF (18%) and Endesa (Spain) (18%). The contract was signed on April 28, 1997, between Jérôme Monod, CEO of Lyonnaise des Eaux, and Abdelmoughit Slimani, President of the Council of Greater Casablanca (\"Communauté Urbaine de Casablanca\").\n\nIn 2008 the concession contract was renegotiated to provide a better balance between the two partners, limiting the rate of return of the concessionnaire from 14.6% to 11.7% and requiring him to increase his investments by Dirham 1bn. Also, automatic tariff increases will now be limited to specific situations such as increases in bulk water or electricity tariffs.\n\nRabat. After direct negotiations in 1998, a concession for Rabat was signed in January 1999 with REDAL, a company consisting of a Portuguese partner (Electrocidade), a Spanish company (Urbaser) and a Moroccan company (Alborada). The concession met with problems from the very beginning. According to a presentation by Moroccan government officials, \"the firm was not ready\" the four partners were not coordinated, the start-up was slow contractual obligations were not fulfilled leading to tumultuous meetings, contestation of bills and protests. As a result, the founding shareholders transferred their equity in REDAL to Vivendi Environnement.\n\nTangiers and Tetouan. The concession in Tangiers and Tetouan covering 23 municipalities with 1.1 million inhabitants was awarded in January 2002 after competitive bidding. Seven bids were received, of which one was discarded for non-conformity. The six offers included groups led by Lyonnaise des Eaux (France), Enron (USA), Thames Water (UK), Union Fenosa (Spain) SAUR (France) and Vivendi (France). The bids were evaluated on the basis of technical and financial criteria combined in a single score. The contract was awarded to the group led by Vivendi, which used the brand name Amendis. The formal name of the group is \"Société des eaux et d'électricité du Nord\" (SEEN), consisting of Vivendi, Hydro-Québec International (Canada) and ONA (Morocco).\n\nThe public counterparts (delegating authorities) of the concessions in Morocco are the municipalities. Each delegating authority has set up a technical committee to regulate the contracts, comprising representatives of the municipality, the Ministry of Interior and the concessionnaire. The committee reviews work plans and reports. In addition, about one year after the contracts in Casablanca and Rabat were signed local supervisory commissions were set up. Also, a supervisory commission was created at the national level. As of 2002, the government concluded that the members representing the delegating authority in the technical committee in Casablanca felt constrained by a lack of expertise compared to the specialists from the private concessionnaire. On the other hand, the concessionnaire felt that there was interference in the management of the services. This improved somewhat after the local supervisory commission was set up in Casablanca. This experience influenced the design of the concession contracts in Tangiers and Tetouan where clauses to protect consumers were added and local supervisory commissions were included in contract design from the beginning.\n\nLydec's 30-year investment plan totals 30 billion Moroccan Dirham. According to one source 21 billion of this sum will come from connection fees paid by new customers into a fund, 8.2 billion would come from Bank loans and internal cash generation, and 0.8 billion would be in the form of equity to be raised by the subsidiary running the concession. According to another source the concessionnaire will not provide any significant equity, nor will it borrow significant debt. Instead it will generate 87.8% of its contribution of 6.3 billion Dirham by using its technical and commercial know-how to mobilize funding from its customers. The remainder would be mobilized through connection fees. According to Lydec, the company invested 7.7 billion Dirham between 1997 and 2008, of which the company financed 4.4 billion. 33% of the investment was for sanitation, 23% for water supply, 34% for electricity and 10% were investments that benefited all three sectors. A substantial share of the investments in sanitation were dedicated to storm water management.\n\nCasablanca. According to Lydec, surveys show that more than 90% of its customers have noticed improvements: shorter waiting time at customer centers, simplified procedures, quicker repairs, more reliable billing and less inundations. In particular, Lydec built the Western collector, a 4.7 km underground stormwater drain with a capacity of 40 m3/s. Also, the company says that it saved 25 million cubic meters of drinking water in 2002 compared to the situation before the concession.\n\nOther cities. According to Amendis, during the first five years of its concession in Tangiers and Tetouan it expanded the wastewater collection and treatment system in the two cities and provided 40,000 subsidized water and wastewater connections. The level of non-revenue water has been reduced from 32% in 2002 to 19% in 2008 in Rabat, and from 41% to 21% in Tangiers, according to Veolia.\n\nCasablanca. According to the Casablanca concession contract, tariffs are adjusted annually based on a price index defined in the contract. If the resulting tariff increase is less than 3% it is applied automatically. If it is more than 3% the private company and the state decide about the measures to be taken. If no decision is taken within two months, the company can apply a 3% tariff increase while the contracting parties decide about how to deal with the remaining tariff increase. Increases in bulk water tariffs and in electricity production tariffs are passed on automatically to consumers, based on the principle \"no loss, no gain\". Between 1997 and 2001 the average water tariff in Casablanca increased by 35% and the average sewerage tariff by 34%. However, the electricity tariff decreased by 6%. During public management by RAD water tariffs had increased by 60% between 1990 and 1995. However, this increase had to a large extent been due to an increase in bulk water tariffs charged by ONEP to RAD.\n\nOther cities. Concerning the concessions by Veolia, tariff increases in the 2007–10 period were lower than contractually required, according to Veolia. The company claims that the government owes it Dirham 93 million (US$11.5 million) because of unimplemented tariff increases. Increases in the tariffs for bulk water supplied by the public company ONEP to the private companies, as well as increases in electricity tariffs, cannot automatically be passed on to consumers.\n\n"}
