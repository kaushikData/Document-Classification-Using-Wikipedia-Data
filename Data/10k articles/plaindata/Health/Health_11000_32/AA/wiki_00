Up to the end of World War II, he worked in Nikolaj Vladimirovich Timefeev-Resovskij’s \"Abteilung für Experimentelle Genetik\" at the \"Kaiser-Wilhelm-Institut für Hirnforschung\" (KWIH, Kaiser Wilhelm Institute for Brain Research). He was taken prisoner by the Russians at the close of World War II. Initially, he worked in Nikolaus Riehl’s group at Plant No. 12 in Ehlektrostal’, but at the end of 1947 was sent to work in Sungul' at a sharshka known under the cover name Ob’ekt 0211. At the Sungul' facility, he again worked in biological research department under the direction of Timofeev-Resovskij. When Catsch returned to Germany in the mid-1950s, he fled to the West. He worked at the \"Biophysikalische Abteilung des Heiligenberg-Instituts\" and then at the \"Institut für Strahlenbiologie am Kernforschungszentrum Karlsruhe\". While in Karlsruhe, he was also appointed, in 1962, to the newly created \"Lehrstuhl für Strahlenbiologie\", at the \"Technische Hochschule Karlsruhe\". In West Germany, he developed methods to extract radionucleotides from various organs.\n\nCatsch was half-German and half-Russian.\n\nCatsch was trained as a medical doctor.\n\nAs early as 1938, Catsch cited his affiliation with the \"I. Medizinischen Universitätsklinik der Charité\"; \"Charité\" was a teaching and research hospital in Berlin. No later than 1942, he was at the \"Kaiser-Wilhelm-Institut für Hirnforschung\" (KWIH, Kaiser Wilhelm Institute for Brain Research) of the \"Kaiser-Wilhelm Gesellschaft\", in Berlin-Buch. At the KWIH, he was in Nikolaj Vladimirovich Timofeev-Resovskij’s \"Abteilung für Experimentelle Genetik\" (Department for Experimental Genetics), a world-renowned department with the status of an institute. There, Catsch conducted research on the effects of radiation on genetic mutations.\n\nWhat happened to Catsch after the Russians entered Berlin at the close of World War II is best understood in the context of his colleagues Karl Zimmer and Hans-Joachim Born at the KWIH, who had a close professional relationship with Nikolaus Riehl, the scientific director of the Auergesellschaft, in Berlin.\n\nAt the close of World War II, Russia had special search teams operating in Austria and Germany, especially in Berlin, to identify and “requisition” equipment, materiel, intellectual property, and personnel useful to the Soviet atomic bomb project. The exploitation teams were under the Russian Alsos, and they were headed by Lavrenij Beria’s deputy, Colonel General A. P. Zavenyagin. These teams were composed of scientific staff members, in NKVD officer’s uniforms, from the bomb project’s only laboratory, Laboratory No. 2, in Moscow. In mid-May 1945, the Russian nuclear physicists Georgy Flerov and Lev Artsimovich, in NKVD colonel’s uniforms, compelled Zimmer to take them to the location of Riehl and his staff, who had evacuated their \"Auergesellschaft\" facilities and were west of Berlin, hoping to be in an area occupied by the American or British military forces. Riehl was detained at the search team’s facility in Berlin-Friedrichshagen for a week. This sojourn in Berlin turned into 10 years in the Soviet Union! Riehl and his staff, including their families, were flown to Moscow on 9 July 1945. Riehl was to head up a uranium production group at Plant No. 12 in Ehlektrostal’ (Электросталь).\n\nFrom 1945 to 1950, Riehl was in charge of uranium production at Plant No. 12 in Ehlektrostal'. When Riehl learned that H. J. Born and Karl Zimmer were being held in Krasnogorsk, in the main PoW camp for Germans with scientific degrees, Riehl arranged though Zavenyagin to have them sent to Ehlektrostal’. Catsch, who had been taken prisoner with Zimmer, was also sent to the Ehlektrostal’ Plant No. 12. At Ehlektrostal’, Riehl had a hard time incorporating Born, Catsch, and Zimmer into his tasking on uranium production, as Born was a radiochemist, Catsch was a physician and radiation biologist, and Zimmer was a physicist and radiation biologist.\n\nAfter the detonation of the Russian uranium bomb, uranium production was going smoothly and Riehl’s oversight was no longer necessary at Plant No. 12. Riehl then went, in 1950, to head an institute in Sungul', where he stayed until 1952. Essentially the remaining personnel in his group were assigned elsewhere, with the exception of H. E. Ortmann, A. Baroni (PoW), and Herbert Schmitz (PoW), who went with Riehl. However, Riehl had already sent Born, Catsch, and Zimmer to the institute in December 1947. The institute in Sungul’ was responsible for the handling, treatment, and use of radioactive products generated in reactors, as well as radiation biology, dosimetry, and radiochemistry. The institute was known as Laboratory B, and it was overseen by the 9th Chief Directorate of the NKVD (MVD after 1946), the same organization which oversaw the Russian Alsos operation. The scientific staff of Laboratory B – a ShARAShKA – was both Soviet and German, the former being mostly political prisoners or exiles, although some of the service staff were criminals. (Laboratory V, in Obninsk, headed by Heinz Pose, was also a sharashka and working on the Soviet atomic bomb project. Other notable Germans at the facility were Werner Czulius, Hans Jürgen von Oertzen, Ernst Rexer, and Carl Friedrich Weiss.)\n\nLaboratory B was known under another cover name as \"Объект 0211\" (Ob’ekt 0211, Object 0211), as well as Object B. (In 1955, Laboratory B was closed. Some of its personnel were transferred elsewhere, but most of them were assimilated into a new, second nuclear weapons institute, Scientific Research Institute-1011, NII-1011, today known as the Russian Federal Nuclear Center All-Russian Scientific Research Institute of Technical Physics, RFYaTs–VNIITF. NII-1011 had the designation \"предприятие п/я 0215\", i.e., enterprise post office box 0215 and \"Объект 0215\"; the latter designation has also been used in reference to Laboratory B after its closure and assimilation into NII-1011.)\n\nOne of the political prisoners in Laboratory B was Riehls’ colleague from the KWIH, N. V. Timofeev-Resovskij, who, as a Soviet citizen, was arrested by the Soviet forces in Berlin at the conclusion of the war, and he was sentenced to 10 years in the Gulag. In 1947, Timofeev-Resovskij was rescued out of a harsh Gulag prison camp, nursed back to health, and sent to Sungul' to complete his sentence, but still make a contribution to the Soviet atomic bomb project. At Laboratory B, Timofeev-Resovskij headed a biophysics research department, in which Born, Catsch, and Zimmer were able to conduct work similar to that which they had done in Germany, and all three became section heads in Timofeev-Resovskij’s department. In fact, in Sungul', Catsch began his work on developing methods to extract radionucleotides from various organs, which he would continue when he left Russia.\n\nIn preparation for release from the Soviet Union, it was standard practice to put personnel into quarantine for a few years if they worked on projects related to the Soviet atomic bomb project, as was the case for Catsch. Additionally, in 1954, the Deutsche Demokratische Republik (DDR, German Democratic Republic) and the Soviet Union prepared a list of scientists they wished to keep in the DDR, due to their having worked on projects related to the Soviet atomic bomb project; this list was known as the “A-list”. On this A-list were the names of 18 scientists. Nine, possibly 10, of the names were associated with the Riehl group which worked at Plant No. 12 in Ehlektrostal'. Born, Catsch, Riehl, and Zimmer were on the list.\n\nIn Russia, Catsch was given a patronymic and his last name was transliterated from German into Russian; transliterated into English his name became Aleksandr Sergeevich Katsch.\n\nCatsch returned to the DDR in the mid-1950s and fled West. Riehl arrived in the DDR on 4 April 1955, and by early June he was in the Federal Republic of Germany (FRG). Other colleagues of Riehl who worked with him in Russia also went West; Günter Wirths fled to the Federal Republic of Germany (FRG) and Karl Zimmer went legally.\n\nAs early as 1956, Catsch was at the \"Biophysikalische Abteilung des Heiligenberg-Instituts\", in Heiligenberg, Baden, Germany.\n\nNo later than 1958, he was at the \"Institut für Strahlenbiologie\" of the \"Kernforschungszentrum Karlsruhe\" (KFK, Karlsruhe Nuclear Research Center), which was founded in 1956 and today is known as the \"Forschungszentrum Karlsruhe\" (FZK, Karlsruhe Research Centere). It was allied with the \"Technische Hochschule Karlsruhe\"; today, it is known as the \"Universität Karlsruhe (TH)\", after its reorganization and renaming in the academic year 1967/1968. In 1962, while still at the KFK, Catsch was appointed to the newly created \"Lehrstuhl für Strahlenbiologie\" at the \"Technische Hochschule Karlsruhe\".\n\nCatsch was married to a Jewish woman.\n\nKarl Zimmer and Catsch were lifelong friends, as well as professional colleagues.\n\nCatsch died in Karlsruhe.\n\n\n\nThe majority of these literature citations have been garnered by searching on variations of the author’s name on Google, Google Scholar, and the Energy Citations Database.\n\n\n\n"}

Hedrick, 365 F.3d 644 (8th Cir. 2004) was a \"pro se\" petition for a writ of habeas corpus filed in the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit in October 2002, appealing the dismissal of a case brought by defendant Benjamin Archuleta. Archuleta had been found not guilty by reason of insanity of assault and subsequently ordered to be confined in a prison mental hospital by the United States District Court for the Western District of Missouri after his successful insanity defense, as he was evaluated by a psychiatrist as dangerous. His appeal challenged this confinement and \"forced treatment\", requested a withdrawal of his original insanity defense, and sought his unconditional release from custody.\n\nThe appellate court reversed the lower court's dismissal of the habeas corpus petition, saying that habeas corpus is a last resort remedy available to those without any other, and the case was remanded back to that court with the instructions to transfer the petition to another district court, the United States District Court for the District of Utah.\n\nBenjamin Archuleta was charged with assaulting a federal official and found not guilty by reason of insanity (NGRI) in the United States District Court for the District of Utah on July 23, 1999. Based on a psychiatric evaluation and the testimony of others, the court ruled that Archuleta's release posed a substantial risk of harm to others and ordered him committed to the United States Medical Center for Federal Prisoners in Springfield, Missouri. Although later Archuleta was conditionally released, his release was revoked on July 8, 2002 and he was recommitted to FMC Springfield until the time he was determined to be eligible for a conditional release by the hospital; such release would be under court supervision.\n\nArchuleta filed a pro se petition (a petition to represent himself) for habeas corpus relief (seeking relief for unlawful detention) in the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Western District of Missouri in October, 2002 requesting an unconditional discharge and release from confinement in the prison hospital. He argued that the statute under which he was committed is unconstitutional because only a judicial unit, not an administrative one, can determine the length and conditions of his sentence and also whether his confinement after his successful NGRI defense could exceed the sentence he would have received if found guilty under the law. He further argued that his confinement in the prison facility far from the court was equal to \"banishment and exile\" and that \"forced treatment\" violated the Eighth Amendment. He also contested the finding that he had violated the terms of his conditional release, saying that he did not refuse the forced treatment \"but for the exception of being late on taking his [anti-psychotic] medication... one day\". He also requested to withdraw his insanity defense.\n\nAt the district court level, the counsel for both parties agreed to court’s interpretation of the pro se petition to focus on the issue of the involuntary administration of psychiatric medication.\n\nThe appellate court ruled that although Archuleta's post-acquittal confinement was constitutional under statute 18 U.S.C. § 4243, it decided to consider the unlawful detention question broadly as \"substantial public interests are involved\", as habeas corpus is a remedy available when no other is available. It ruled the lower court erred in overlooking the seriousness of the grievance, as the statute under which Archuleta was committed for involuntary treatment did not prevent him \"from establishing by writ of habeas corpus the illegality of his detention\". Some issues, such as whether an insanity defense can be withdrawn upon appeal, have not been settled.\n\nThe court vacated the dismissal order and remanded the case back to the district court, instructing that court to transfer the case to the U.S. District Court for the District of Utah, pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1406(a), a statute which provides that the appellate court in which a case is wrongly filed may either dismiss it, or in the interest of justice, transfer the case to any district in which it could have been brought.\n"}

Twenty tonnes of aluminium sulphate was inadvertently added to the water supply, raising the concentration to 3,000 times the admissible level. As the aluminium sulphate broke down it produced several tonnes of sulphuric acid which \"stripped a cocktail of chemicals from the pipe networks as well as lead and copper piping in people’s homes.\" Many people who came into contact with the contaminated water experienced a range of short-term health effects, and many victims suffered long-term effects whose implications remained unclear . There has been no rigorous examination or monitoring of the health of the victims since the incident, which is Britain's worst mass poisoning event. Inquests on people who died many years later found very high levels of aluminium in the brain. Dame Barbara Clayton led a Royal Commission on Environmental Pollution enquiry into the incident.\n\nImmediately after the contamination the authorities said that the water was safe to drink, possibly with juice to cover the unpleasant taste. In an inquest in 2012 into the death of one of the victims, the coroner stated that South West Water Authority had been \"gambling with as many as 20,000 lives\" when they failed to inform the public about the poisoning for 16 days, a delay he called unacceptable. In the aftermath of the contamination the public were reassured that there was no risk to health. There were allegations of a cover-up and West Somerset Coroner Michael Rose stated: \"I found there was a deliberate policy to not advise the public of the true nature until some 16 days after the occurrence of the incident.\" Following an investigation by the government's Committee on Toxicity of Chemicals in Food, Consumer Products and the Environment, Michael Meacher, the former Environment Minister, claimed that \"various associated bodies tried to bury the inquiry from the start.\" Meacher told one newspaper: \"This has become a tug of war between the truth and an attempt to silence the truth.\"\n\nAn April 2013 report by the Lowermoor subgroup of the Committee on Toxicity of Chemicals in Food, Consumer Products and the Environment concluded that exposure to the chemicals was unlikely to cause \"delayed or persistent harm\" and was also unlikely to cause future ill health. In September 2013 the government admitted that there had been a \"manifest failure to give prompt appropriate advice and information to affected consumers\" and offered an unreserved apology.\n\nOn 6 July 1988, John Stephens, a relief tanker driver working for ISC Chemicals, a Bristol-based subsidiary of Rio Tinto Zinc, arrived at Lowermoor Water Treatment Works on Bodmin Moor and found it unmanned. Being unfamiliar with the location, he had been given a key by another driver and told simply that \"once inside the gate, the aluminium sulphate tank is on the left\". However, the key fitted almost every lock used by the South West Water Authority (SWWA). After twenty minutes looking for the correct tank he tried the key on a manhole cover and when it unlocked believed he had accessed the correct tank. He poured the load of 20 tonnes of aluminium sulphate, used to remove solid particles from raw water, into the tank, which actually held treated water prior to distribution to the consumers in Camelford. This immediately contaminated the water supply to 20,000 local people and up to 10,000 tourists. The maximum recorded aluminium concentration was 620 milligrams per litre compared with the maximum concentration admissible at the time by the European Community of 0.2 milligrams per litre.\n\nFor several days the water authority insisted the water was safe, and should be mixed with orange juice to disguise the taste of the as yet unknown contaminant. One customer who telephoned the authority the day after the contamination was told \"there had been some acidity, but the water was perfectly safe to drink,\" and was no more harmful than lemon juice. On 14 July 1988 the authority sent a circular letter to all customers \"asserting that the water from the treatment works was of the right alkalinity and was safe to use and drink.\" Within two days, the authority suspected the source of the contamination was the erroneous delivery, which was confirmed on 12 July when the driver was asked to return to the treatment works. However, it was not until ten days later on 22 July that the authority's chairman Keith Court authorised a public notice, containing the first mention of the aluminium sulphate, to be published in the sports section of a local newspaper, the \"Western Morning News\". Stephens stated that after the site meeting where he confirmed he had delivered the chemical to the wrong tank he was told by the authority \"not to mention it to anyone else\". The SWWA district manager, John Lewis, said they had realised within 48 hours that aluminium sulphate was the likely cause of the contamination, but Lewis said he had been instructed by Leslie Nicks, the head of operations, not to tell the public.\n\nDouglas Cross, a consultant biologist based in Camelford, tested the water and found that it contained \"not only aluminium sulphate but other noxious substances, too. As the acidic liquid travelled from the plant into people's homes, it corroded the copper pipes and their soldered joints, made of zinc and lead.\" Official advice to boil the water before drinking was, according to Cross, \"dangerous advice because it concentrates the contaminants. They kept flushing the pipes out for months after the incident. This will have stirred up debris in the bends and only have lengthened the amount of time the water was coming through the taps with all sorts of metals in it.\"\n60,000 salmon and trout were killed in the Camel and Allen rivers during the flushing out process. The contamination was compounded by the failure of the authority to carry out the required six-monthly cleaning of the tank, which had not been cleaned for three years leading to a build up of sludge.\n\nA month after the contamination, Michael Waring at the Department of Health (DH) wrote to every doctor in Cornwall saying that, \"although he had no detailed information on what was exactly in the water or how much people might have drunk, he could assure them that no lasting ill effects would result.\" GK Matthews, a senior toxicologist at the DH, suggested a team of medical experts should be sent to the area immediately but a month later said he had been \"overruled\". The National Union of Public Employees said that the procedure by which the driver had access to the site was common through the region and that they believed this was connected with reduced staffing levels and privatisation plans. They added that they were concerned about the three-week delay in reporting what had happened, and that SWWA district manager John Lewis had been \"instructed at a very high level to say nothing\". Lewis (not a member of the union) had been dismissed; the union said \"To single him out is unfair\".\n\nIn August 1988 a highly critical report by Dr John Lawrence, a senior ICI scientist and non-executive member of the water authority, blamed lax procedures. He also criticised communication failures which kept information from the public.\n\nThe Lowermoor Incident Health Advisory Group (LIHAG) was set up in January 1989 to provide expert advice to the Cornwall and Isles of Scilly District Health Authority on the health implications for the population of the Camelford area. In 1989 the LIHAG reported that there was no convincing evidence of a harmful build-up of aluminium and that there was no increase in ill health from poisoned water. A further enquiry by the same group in 1991 acknowledged the affair had caused \"real suffering\" in the community. However, Dame Barbara Clayton concluded that this was because of sensational reporting of the incident. She stated that \"In our judgment it is likely that these symptoms would have occurred in the normal course of events,\" and the symptoms were wrongly attributed to the contamination because of \"inaccurate and exaggerated\" claims of health damage by scientists and the news media. When the Clayton report was released in July 1989, it caused \"outrage in Camelford and wide disbelief in the scientific community.\" One section was later amended to read \"alarming statements by \"pseudo-\"scientists\" rather than \"...by \"some\" scientists\".\n\nIn June 2000 Environment minister Michael Meacher announced that there would not be an independent public inquiry, and declared \"All the facts are fully known and there is no reason to believe that a public inquiry could add to that.\" In November 2000 the Environmental Law Centre prepared a petition to the European Parliament calling for a Brussels-based inquiry. On 14 August 2001 the government announced that an investigation – although not a full public inquiry – into the incident would take place. The investigation was to be undertaken by the newly formed Lowermoor Subgroup (LSG) consisting of scientific and health experts and local resident representatives, chaired by Frank Woods, a professor of medicine at the University of Sheffield. Woods was also the head of the government's Committee on Toxicity of Chemicals in Food, Consumer Products and the Environment (COT), of which the Lowermoor team was a subgroup. Its remit was to advise on whether the incident had caused, or was expected to cause, long-term harm to human health and examine whether the existing programme of monitoring and research into the human health effects was sufficient.\n\nA draft report, published on 26 January 2005, was inconclusive, saying that the long-term health effects on the population were still unknown and that there was insufficient scientific information available to determine whether the health problems being experienced were caused by the contamination. Woods called for further studies and said: \"We will be putting the strongest possible case to the minister. I believe carrying out that work is important, it is not something which should be dropped and pushed aside.\"\n\nThe following year, Meacher made several criticisms of the group:\n\nTwo members of the LSG committee claimed in December 2007 that the DoH had known from the start that some people were at especially high risk from aluminium poisoning but deliberately suppressed this evidence to protect the government's plans for water privatisation.\n\nThe final report was published in April 2013, and concluded that it was unlikely that the exposure to chemicals could have caused long-term health problems. Key findings of the report include:\n\n\nA diverse array of short term health effects was reported by members of the public who either drank the contaminated water or came into contact with it while bathing. These included:\n\nA 1999 report in the \"British Medical Journal\" concluded that some victims had suffered \"considerable damage\" to their brain function. This contradicted the 1991 LIHAG report telling residents that their symptoms were due to anxiety. The study was led by a consultant nephrologist at John Radcliffe Hospital, Oxford, and was the first large-scale clinical study of the affected residents. The report stated that their symptoms were similar to those of Alzheimer's disease, which has also been linked with large quantities of aluminium accumulating in the brain. Rejecting the findings of the LIG, the report called for further research to determine the longer term prognosis for the affected individuals and led to fresh calls for a public inquiry into the pollution incident. Although the study was carried out in 1991, its publication was delayed by the ongoing litigation between SWWA and the victims.\n\nVictims have reported:\n\nSeven months after the contamination, one victim underwent a bone biopsy which \"found a ring of aluminium like the rings you see in trees\" that could not have resulted from normal aluminium absorption.\n\nThe husband of Carol Cross, who died of a rare form of dementia in 2004, said in 2006 that he believed that his wife and twenty other people had died as a result of the disaster, and that more cases were emerging.\n\nVictim Sarah Sillifant, who was in her twenties when she was exposed, hanged herself in 2005 after suffering dementia and other symptoms similar to those experienced by Carol Cross. In June 2007, Irene Neal, who lived in Rock, near Camelford at the time of the incident, died aged 91. A post-mortem found an \"unacceptable amount of aluminium in the brain\".\n\nIn 2006 a post-mortem inquest into the death of Carol Cross at age 58, who was exposed to the contaminated drinking water aged 44, showed that her brain contained 23 micrograms of aluminium per gram of brain, compared to the normal brain levels of 0–2 micrograms per gram. Her death was caused by a form of early-onset beta amyloid angiopathy, a cerebro-vascular disease usually associated with Alzheimer's, which could be connected to the abnormally high level of aluminium in her brain. Michael Rose, the West Somerset Coroner, said of the findings: \"Further research will be needed before the significance of the elevated brain aluminium concentration in this case can be clarified. A scientific report on the case has been submitted for publication.\" Daniel Perl, of New York's Mount Sinai School of Medicine said: \"If additional similar cases were to appear among the 20,000 exposed individuals then the implications of this incident would become extremely important. Only time will tell. At the very least, increased efforts towards surveillance of individuals exposed in Camelford is certainly warranted.\"\n\nRose had adjourned the inquests for Cross and Neal pending further studies, but in 2008 said the Government had refused \"to either finance or assist\" research to test the hypothesis of a link between exposure to aluminium and congophilic amyloid angiopathy. He said this research was necessary to determine the consequences of the deceased having such a high level of aluminium. He later sought support from Somerset County Council so that the work could go ahead and once more adjourned the inquest into the death of Carol Cross, although Neal's inquest went ahead.\n\nIn July 2009 Rose announced that the inquest into Cross's death would resume in November 2010. Rose said that \"ongoing medical research would not be completed until late summer\" 2010. He explained \"This research is necessary to prove whether or not the high level of aluminium in Mrs Cross's brain causing her death through beta amyloid angiopathy (a form of cerebrovascular disease) on February 19, 2004, could be attributed to the aluminium sulphate placed in the public water supply at Lowermoor treatment works on July 6, 1988. This is the last adjournment I am able to agree and the inquest will commence on Monday November 1, 2010 at Taunton.\"\n\nWhen the inquest was reconvened Dr. Chris Exley, a reader in bioinorganic chemistry at Keele University, said \"The brain aluminium concentration was so high that it is highly likely that it contributed to her brain pathology, probably being responsible for the aggressive form and very early onset of the disease.\" Neuropathologist Prof. Margaret Esiri, from the John Radcliffe Hospital, said \"I have never seen a case such as this at this age. I have seen one case in a woman who died aged 81 but the literature shows only a handful of cases worldwide.\" As a result of their evidence the inquest was again adjourned to allow South West Water Authority time to seek its own expert evidence.\n\nCarol Cross's inquest was finally completed in March 2012. The coroner returned a narrative verdict recording the circumstances without attributing the cause, in which he said the water supply company, South West Water Authority had been \"gambling with as many as 20,000 lives\" when they failed to inform the public about the poisoning for 16 days, a delay he called unacceptable. An expert said at the inquest that the levels of aluminium in her brain were \"beyond belief\".\n\nRose stated: \"I found there was a deliberate policy to not advise the public of the true nature until some 16 days after the occurrence of the incident,\" and that \"[T]he failure of the authority to visit every house after the incident to advise them to thoroughly flush their systems [w]as a serious dereliction of duty. I can say that the incident may either have contributed to or possibly caused Mrs Cross's death, but I do not have sufficient evidence to say so conclusively.\"\n\nIn 1991 the South West Water Authority was fined £10,000 and ordered to pay £25,000 costs at Exeter Crown Court for supplying water likely to endanger public health. The authority paid at least £123,000 to settle almost 500 initial compensation claims and in 1997 a further 148 victims accepted out-of-court damages totalling almost £400,000, approved by a High Court judge sitting in Truro. The settlements ranged from £680 to £10,000. Some later claimed they were \"railroaded\" into accepting the out-of-court settlements after being told that their legal aid funding would be withdrawn if they continued with the lawsuit. The judge, Mr Justice Wright, said: \"If the case had been contested, there would have been awesomely complex argument over how much [water] they consumed\" and that they were \"extraordinarily well advised to accept the offer.\" Cross later said: \"The official medical claim from the health authority was that there was no known pathway for aluminium to be absorbed into the body. I would argue that this was a misrepresentation of scientific facts, however it was accepted by the judge [and he] instructed the jury that medical damages could not be awarded. The victims therefore received negligible compensation. This alone is adequate reason for a judicial review, since it resulted in a miscarriage of justice for the victims.\"\n\nOn 13 December 2007 Michael Rose announced that, in light of \"a possible attempt to initially suppress the seriousness of the incident, I am asking the chief constable of Devon and Cornwall to hand me evidence gathered at the time of the original investigation,\" and for the chief constable to appoint a senior detective \"to look into the allegations of a possible cover-up.\"\n\nAt the time of the incident the water industry was about to be privatised by the Conservative government of the day; a letter written from a water official to Michael Howard, then Minister of State for Water and Planning, emerged which stated that a police investigation into the poisoning incident was viewed as \"very distracting\" and that any subsequent prosecution of South West Water would also \"be totally unhelpful to privatisation... and render the whole of the water industry unattractive to the City\". The \"Western Morning News\", using a Freedom of Information Act request, uncovered a briefing note to the then Environment Minister, Nicholas Ridley, warning: \"Those of the South West board with a commercial background are deeply concerned by the investigation.\"\nThere was speculation in the news media that commercial concerns were given priority over public health.\n\nThe former North Cornwall Liberal Democrat Member of Parliament (MP) Paul Tyler also uncovered documents contradicting the water authority's claim that it had advised consumers not to drink the water, and that this advice had been given in a radio broadcast at 6am on 7 July 1988 and subsequently. The documents, relating to the prosecution of South West Water, alleged that this \"was not the advice given to the public on the 6th, 7th, 8th, or indeed on the 12th,\" and added that the prosecution would say that the authority \"misled Mr Healey (the head of the drinking water division at the Department of Environment)... There is evidence that a deliberate decision was made to conceal the truth from the public.\" Tyler said \"I can't think of any comparable accident or mistake anywhere in Britain, particularly one involving what was a government agency, where there was no attempt to investigate what went wrong and why.\"\n\nIn 2001 Environment Minister Michael Meacher claimed that the Government feared what an unrestricted inquiry might find, and that \"There was then a great deal of shenanigans about the terms of reference and fighting at all levels in order to limit the ambit of the committee to get the result they wanted. This inquiry was always potentially hugely damaging and hugely worrying to the establishment in terms of the way they handled the incident and clearly there are elements that want to shut it down.\" No named individuals were ever prosecuted.\nThe national water industry was sold, under the Conservative government, for £3.59 billion, with the sale of South West Water Authority raising around £300 million.\n\n\n"}

The HPC held a public consultation on the PLG recommendations, which ran for three months in 2009. Following the consultation, the PLG was reconvened and had its last meeting on 2 February 2011.\n\nIn February 2011, the Government published a command paper, \"Enabling Excellence\", which set out the coalition government's policy on professional regulation. The paper outlined a system of what it called \"assured voluntary registration\" and said that in the future statutory regulation will only be considered where there is a \"compelling case\", and where \"voluntary registers are not considered sufficient to manage this risk\". Later that month, the HPC's Chief Executive Marc Seale wrote to Anne Milton MP, then Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Public Health, seeking clarification of the coalition government's policy on the statutory regulation of psychotherapists and counsellors.\n\nAt its meeting on 31 March 2011 the Council discussed the response received from Anne Milton MP. The letter said: \"...it is not currently our intention to proceed with statutory regulation of psychotherapists and counsellors\".\n\nThe largest UK counselling organisation is the British Association for Counselling and Psychotherapy (BACP). It grew from the Standing Conference for the Advancement of Counselling, a grouping of organisations inaugurated in 1970 at the instigation of the National Council for Voluntary Organisations. Membership was extended to include individuals when in 1977, with the aid of a grant from the Home Office Voluntary Service Unit, the British Association for Counselling was founded. In 1978 the headquarters was moved from London to Rugby courtesy of the National Marriage Guidance Council which provided free accommodation to help the association establish itself.\n\nIn September 2000, the Association recognised that it no longer represented just counselling, but also psychotherapy. It changed its name to the British Association for Counselling and Psychotherapy (BACP). BACP is now the largest and broadest body within the sector with approximately 26,000 individual members. BACP participates in the development of counselling and psychotherapy at an international level.\n\nBACP is recognised by most health providers and claims a membership of several thousand.\n\n\nAccording to the introduction on their main website The Survivors Trust is a national umbrella agency for over 125 specialist voluntary sector agencies throughout the UK and Ireland providing a range of counselling, therapeutic and support services working with women, men and children who are victims/survivors of rape, sexual violence and sexual abuse. The organisation aims to offer a national collective voice to support and empower survivor groups, to educate and inform acknowledgment of and response to sexual abuse on a local and national level.\n\nThe National Counselling Society (NCS) is a not-for-profit membership organisation, founded by a group of counsellors, psychotherapists, psychologists and hypnotherapists in 1999. The aim of the NCS is to promote and support the practice of counselling, and does so by offering a range of services to members, including a comprehensive training programme. The NCS also benefits the patients of counsellors by ensuring that the counsellors in their organisation follow their stringent code of ethics; facing expulsion if they deviate or break any of their established codes of conduct and practice.\n\n\nCOSCA is a professional body for counselling and psychotherapy in Scotland, which seeks to advance all forms of counselling and psychotherapy and the use of counselling skills.\n\nAccording to the organisations website, COSCA’s aims are to increase accessibility to counselling and psychotherapy, develop ethically-based professional standards and quality assurance for counselling, psychotherapy and the use of counselling skills, increase access to training and information on counselling, psychotherapy and counselling skills, deliver a range of services that meet the needs of the counselling and psychotherapy field, provide opportunities for sharing knowledge, experience and resources for the advancement of counselling, psychotherapy and the use of counselling skills in Scotland.\n\n\nThe Counselling Society is one of a number of UK counselling professional organisations.

{"id": "23254182", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=23254182", "title": "Deficit irrigation", "text": "Deficit irrigation\n\nDeficit irrigation (DI) is a watering strategy that can be applied by different types of irrigation application methods. The correct application of DI requires thorough understanding of the yield response to water (crop sensitivity to drought stress) and of the economic impact of reductions in harvest. In regions where water resources are restrictive it can be more profitable for a farmer to maximize crop water productivity instead of maximizing the harvest per unit land. The saved water can be used for other purposes or to irrigate extra units of land.\nDI is sometimes referred to as incomplete supplemental irrigation or regulated DI.\n\nDeficit irrigation (DI) has been reviewed and defined as follows:\n\n\"Deficit irrigation is an optimization strategy in which irrigation is applied during drought-sensitive growth stages of a crop. Outside these periods, irrigation is limited or even unnecessary if rainfall provides a minimum supply of water. Water restriction is limited to drought-tolerant phenological stages, often the vegetative stages and the late ripening period. Total irrigation application is therefore not proportional to irrigation requirements throughout the crop cycle. While this inevitably results in plant drought stress and consequently in production loss, DI maximizes irrigation water productivity, which is the main limiting factor (English, 1990). In other words, DI aims at stabilizing yields and at obtaining maximum crop water productivity rather than maximum yields (Zhang and Oweis, 1999).\"\n\nCrop water productivity (WP) or water use efficiency (WUE) expressed in kg/m³ is an efficiency term, expressing the amount of marketable product (e.g. kilograms of grain) in relation to the amount of input needed to produce that output (cubic meters of water). The water used for crop production is referred to as crop evapotranspiration. This is a combination of water lost by evaporation from the soil surface and transpiration by the plant, occurring simultaneously. Except by modeling, distinguishing between the two processes is difficult. Representative values of WUE for cereals at field level, expressed with evapotranspiration in the denominator, can vary between 0.10 and 4 kg/m3.\n\nFor certain crops, experiments confirm that DI can increase water use efficiency without severe yield reductions. For example for winter wheat in Turkey, planned DI increased yields by 65% as compared to winter wheat under rainfed cultivation, and had double the water use efficiency as compared to rainfed and fully irrigated winter wheat. Similar positive results have been described for cotton. Experiments in Turkey and India indicated that the irrigation water use for cotton could be reduced to up to 60 percent of the total crop water requirement with limited yield losses. In this way, high water productivity and a better nutrient-water balance was obtained.\n\nCertain Underutilized and horticultural crops also respond favorably to DI, such as tested at experimental and farmer level for the crop quinoa. Yields could be stabilized at around 1.6 tons per hectare by supplementing irrigation water if rainwater was lacking during the plant establishment and reproductive stages. Applying irrigation water throughout the whole season (full irrigation) reduced the water productivity. Also in viticulture and fruit tree cultivation, DI is practiced.\n\nScientists affiliated with the Agricultural Research Service (ARS) of the USDA found that conserving water by forcing drought (or deficit irrigation) on peanut plants early in the growing season has shown to cause early maturation of the plant yet still maintain sufficient yield of the crop. Inducing drought through deficit irrigation earlier in the season caused the peanut plants to physiologically \"learn\" how to adapt to a stressful drought environment, making the plants better able to cope with drought that commonly occurs later in the growing season. Deficit irrigation is beneficial for the farmers because it reduces the cost of water and prevents a loss of crop yield (for certain crops) later on in the growing season due to drought. In addition to these findings, ARS scientists suggest that deficit irrigation accompanied with conservation tillage would greatly reduce the peanut crop water requirement.\n\nFor other crops, the application of deficit irrigation will result in a lower water use efficiency and yield. This is the case when crops are sensitive to drought stress throughout the complete season, such as maize.\n\nApart from university research groups and farmers associations, international organizations such as FAO, ICARDA, IWMI and the CGIAR Challenge Program on Water and Food are studying DI.\n\nIf crops have certain phenological phases in which they are tolerant to water stress, DI can increase the ratio of yield over crop water consumption (evapotranspiration) by either reducing the water loss by unproductive evaporation, and/or by\nincreasing the proportion of marketable yield to the totally produced biomass (harvest index), and/or by increasing the proportion of total biomass production to transpiration due to hardening of the crop - although this effect is very limited due to the conservative relation between biomass production and crop transpiration, - and/or due to adequate fertilizer application and/or by avoiding bad agronomic conditions during crop growth, such as water logging in the root zone, pests and diseases, etc.\n\nThe correct application of DI for a certain crop:\n\nA number of constraints apply to deficit irrigation:\n\nField experimentation is necessary for correct application of DI for a particular crop in a particular region. In addition, simulation of the soil water balance and related crop growth (crop water productivity modeling) can be a valuable decision support tool. By conjunctively simulating the effects of different influencing factors (climate, soil, management, crop characteristics) on crop production, models allow to (1) better understand the mechanism behind improved water use efficiency, to (2) schedule the necessary irrigation applications during the drought sensitive crop growth stages, considering the possible variability in climate, to (3) test DI strategies of specific crops in new regions, and to (4) investigate the effects of future climate scenarios or scenarios of altered management practices on crop production.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "30967160", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=30967160", "title": "Disi Water Conveyance", "text": "Disi Water Conveyance\n\nThe Disi Water Conveyance Project is a water supply project in Jordan. It is designed to pump of water per year from the Disi aquifer, which lies beneath the desert in southern Jordan and northwestern Saudi Arabia. The water is piped to the capital, Amman, and other cities to meet increased demand. Construction began in 2009 and was mostly completed in July 2013 when the project was inaugurated by King Abdullah of Jordan. Its total cost was US$1.1 billion. \n\nAn independent study revealed the water to be radioactive and potentially dangerous to drink, initially surrounding the project with controversy. Jordan's Ministry of Water and Irrigation has stated that the radioactivity is not a problem because the water is to be diluted with an equal amount of water from other sources, although it remains disputed if this would be enough to bring the water up to standards. The Ministry said the independent study was inaccurate, as it did not test water from any of the wells that will be used in the project. The President of the Jordanian Geologists Association Bahjat Al Adwan stated that the radiation is present in the water in the form of Radon, and thus dissipates harmlessly when the water is exposed to air on the surface.\n\nThe water in the Disi aquifer gathered 30,000 years ago during the Pleistocene era. It is long and located below ground inside of porous sandstone. The aquifer is classified as a fossil aquifer, meaning that the water is not replenished if it is removed. In fact, the aquifer has a recharge rate of of water per year. This recharge is dwarfed, however, by the current extraction rate of for agricultural and domestic needs, including of water that is supplied to Aqaba, Jordan. The current extraction rate of , coupled with the future extraction rate of for the project, is expected to produce a total extraction rate of . At that rate, the water in the aquifer will last a minimum of 50 years, according to the Disi Water Company.\n\nOnly a small portion of the Disi aquifer lies beneath Jordan, while the majority lies beneath Saudi Arabia. Saudi Arabia also extracts water from the aquifer (called the Saq aquifer in Saudi Arabia). The aquifer has created controversy between Saudi Arabia and Jordan, with each country demanding the other to use less of the shared water. There is no formal agreement between the countries regarding the water and the Disi Water Conveyance Project is being constructed without Saudi consultation or involvement.\n\nNon-revenue water is a serious problem in Amman. Currently, 40% of water in Amman is lost as non-revenue water. The city rations water, with individual residents averaging 36 hours of water access weekly. If the non-revenue water problem remains, it is possible that a large portion of the water provided by the Disi Water Conveyance project will also be lost as it is piped through Amman.\n\nThe Disi Water Conveyance project was first proposed in the 1990s, but was initially regarded as too expensive. A feasibility study was completed in 1996. But it was not until 2007 that the Jordanian Government was able to contract a firm to begin construction.\n\nThe project proposed by the Jordanian government will pump of water per year from 55 wells in the aquifer. However, a total of 64 wells will be drilled, the extra wells to be used as piezometers to measure the elevation of the water. Nine of the 55 water producing wells will be used in emergencies only. The wells producing water will be drilled deep while the piezometers will be drilled to a depth of . The plan is to pump the piezometer wells for 25 years, according to the project leader.\n\nAfter being pumped from the wells, water will then be transported to Amman, via a pipeline, passing through a pumping station, then flowing by gravity and being pumped up again. The reservoirs near Amman are only higher than the surface area where the pumping field is located. Nevertheless, the total elevation differential over which water needs to be lifted by both pumping stations is about . To pump the water through the proposed pipeline will require 4 kilowatt-hours per cubic meter of water. The entire project would require approximately 4 percent of Jordan's current electrical production. The project is expected to be completed by January 2017 and to run for 25 years or until the Two Seas Canal is built.\n\nThe of water will be divided between the Abu Alanda reservoir and the Dabouq reservoir. Approximately of water will be sent to the Abu Alanda reservoir where it will be diluted with water from the Zara Ma’en desalination plant as well as water from Wala. The remaining of water will be sent to the Dabouq reservoir where it will be diluted with water from the Zai Treatment Plant as well as water from Wala. It is estimated that the cost of one cubic meter of water from the project will be 0.74 JOD (US$1.05).\n\nIn June 2009, the Turkish firm GAMA began construction. By February 2011, eight piezometer wells and two water producing wells have been completed. Twenty-three other wells were to be drilled, and of pipe were to be installed. By April 2011, 99% of the of project's piping had arrived from Turkey, an anonymous source told \"The Jordan Times\". This source stated that the project was over 50% completed and that it was ahead of schedule.\nConstruction was delayed by disgruntled members of a Bedouin tribe living in the area, who allegedly intimidated workers by shooting in the air and at construction equipment. All work was stopped for two weeks after two employees were killed in January 2011 — allegedly murdered by a member of the Bedouin tribe. The tribe had been upset because GAMA did not rent its water tankers, according to Adnan Zu'b, Assistant Secretary Genera at the Ministry of Water and Irrigation. To satisfy the tribe, GAMA then announced plans to rent tankers from the tribe. However, near the site of the killings, the town of Ma'an had protests against the government's failure to punish the killers. During October and November, 2011 the construction works have been suspended at southern part of the project from Hasa to Mudawwara due to security problems created by tribes, therefore there is delay in this part which will affect the completion date of the project.\n\nThe project is funded on a build-operate-transfer concession contract between the Jordanian government and the Disi Water Company (Diwaco), a subsidiary of the Turkish construction company GAMA Energy. GAMA Energy is a joint venture between the Turkish GAMA Holding and the US firm General Electric Energy Financial Services. Diwaco is responsible to build the project over a 4-year period and to operate it for another 25 years. At the end of the concession period the ownership will transfer to the Jordanian government. Diwaco will retain any profits and will bear the risk of losing its equity. Construction is undertaken by GAMA Power Systems, another subsidiary of GAMA Holding, under a turnkey engineering, procurement and construction contract with Diwaco. Operation will be undertaken by Disi Amman Operation Maintenance LLC, a fully owned subsidiary of the French water company Suez Environnement, under a separate operating contract with Diwaco.\n\nThe project is funded through an equity contribution of about US$200M from Diwaco, a $300M grant and a $100M stand-by facility from the Jordanian government, as well as US$475M in foreign loans to Diwaco. The project's total cost is expected to be US$1.1 billion. The U.S. Overseas Private Investment Corporation has lent US$250M to Diwaco to support U.S. foreign investment on the basis that General Electric partially owns GAMA Energy. The state-owned French bank PROPARCO, which is the part of the French Development Agency (AFD) that supports private sector development, and the European Investment Bank (EIB) each lent about US$100M to Diwaco. The loan package has been put together by the Arab Banking Corporation. Much of the government grant supporting the project comes from sovereign soft loans that the government of Jordan has borrowed from the EIB and AFD and passes on as a grant to the project. AFD provided US$50M for the state grant and $48M for the stand-by facility.\n\nThe project became controversial in 2009 when a study performed by Avner Vengosh of Duke University revealed the Disi water to be highly radioactive. Water was tested from 37 existing wells in the aquifer, and all but one had concentrations of radioactive radium-226 and radium-228 isotopes that exceeded international standards for drinking water. Some of the water tested exceeded standards by 2,000%. Drinking water with these isotopes has been linked to bone cancer and leukemia. Though expensive, the water could be purified of the radioactive isotopes through ion-exchange purification.\n\nJordan's Ministry of Water and Irrigation has stated that the radioactivity is not a problem because the water is to be diluted with an equal amount of water from other sources. This dilution would presumably halve the radioactivity of the water which, according to Vengosh's data, would not be enough to bring the water up to standards. The Ministry of Water and Irrigation, however, has declared Vengosh's data to be inaccurate, as his study did not test water from any of the wells that will be used in the project. As radiation varies from well to well, it is possible that the data Vengosh collected does not accurately reflect the water sources to be used in the project.\n\nAlthough testing at the well sites that supply Aqaba reveals high radioactivity, testing performed using water from the tap in Aqaba shows the water to be safe. There is no confirmed explanation for this phenomenon, although it is hypothesized that the depth of the wells (the ones that supply Aqaba are relatively shallow) may play a role as the radiation varies greatly at shallow depths.\nIn May, 2011, the President of the Jordanian Geologists Association Bahjat Al Adwan stated that the radiation is present in the water in the form of Radon, and thus dissipates harmlessly when the water is exposed to air on the surface. This explanation has not been confirmed scientifically, however.\n\nDuring the inauguration of the conveyor in July 2013 Minister of Water and Irrigation Hazim El-Nasser said that after mixing Disi water radiation is less than 0.5 millisievert per year. The worldwide average natural dose of human's exposure to radiation is about 2.5-3 millisievert per year. \"Disi water is purer than bottled water and I take full responsibility for what I’m saying,” the Minister said during a press conference.\n\n"}

Both owners and pets receive many benefits. It also provides exercise and companionship for the walker.\n\nIn the UK, The Kennel Club conducted a survey of 1,000 dog owners and found that one in five did not walk their dogs on a daily basis.\n\nDogs are walked restrained by a collar around their neck or by a harness, or by simply following their guardian by familiarity and verbal control. Commonly, the dog is walked by the guardian, or by another family member, but there are also professional dog walkers.\n\nA study by Michigan State University showed that people who walk their dogs are 34% more likely to meet expected levels of exercise, with a recommended level of 150 minutes of activity such as dog walking per week. Matthew Reeves, the co-author of the study said, \"There is no magic bullet in getting people to reach those benchmarks but walking a dog has a measurable impact.\"\n\nResearch conducted by the University of Western Australia has discovered that walking your dog helps build relationships in your community research showed that people in the community would acknowledge and greet other people in the street exchange favors with neighbors which can encourage more exercise in the community giving pets and owners a chance at a healthier life.\n\nProfessional dog walkers, both individuals and businesses, are paid by dog owners to walk their dogs for them. Some dog walkers will take many dogs for a walk at once, while others will only take a single dog. The length of a walk might vary by breed or owners request ranging from short relief walks to longer walks with a specific amount of time set by the owner. Also growing in popularity is \"dog running\". Dog runners are professionals who run with dogs, rather than walking with them. In some jurisdictions, dog walking businesses must be licensed and have animal first-aid-trained employees. Professional dog walking services can be obtained locally or through online referral services. Obtaining a position as a professional dog walker has become more difficult, with applicants having to pass rigorous exams and go through extensive training. \n\nIn the United States, the first professional dog walker is believed to have been Jim Buck, who in 1960 launched his dog walking service in New York City.\n\n"}
{"id": "28859692", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=28859692", "title": "Electronic patient-reported outcome", "text": "Electronic patient-reported outcome\n\nAn electronic patient-reported outcome (ePRO) is a patient-reported outcome that is collected by electronic methods. ePRO methods are most commonly used in clinical trials, but they are also used elsewhere in health care. As a function of the regulatory process, a majority of ePRO questionnaires undergo the linguistic validation process.\n\nThe two main methods currently used for ePRO are computers/Smartphones and telephone systems\n\n\"Computers\" are most often touch-screen devices, ranging from small hand-helds such as the Palm Pilot, through tablet PCs. The smaller devices are often used as electronic diaries, designed to be used for symptom reporting on a daily basis. Larger devices are generally used in a clinic setting. Computers generally run dedicated ePRO applications - the use of the web for ePRO is not yet widespread. Typically a single question at a time is presented on the screen, with a set of possible response options. The user taps on the appropriate response with finger or stylus, then moves on to the next questions.\n\n\"Telephones\" normally use an interactive voice response system (IVR). The user calls into a dedicated phone line, and hears a spoken script which details the question, and the possible responses. Each response option is given a number, and the user presses the corresponding number key on the phone keypad to record the choice. IVR systems are more often used for diaries, with the patient phoning in e.g. from home, but they can be used in a clinic setting.\n\nThere are also a number of custom devices designed specifically for use as ePRO data collection devices.\n\nDiaries are used when it is desirable to obtain frequent assessments over a period of time, for example when a condition fluctuates in severity. In such cases recall of severity over a period of time is unlikely to be accurate. Research has shown substantial bias in such summary recall, with ratings unduly influenced by how the patient is feeling at the time of making the rating, and by maximum severity rather than average severity during the assessment interval. Diaries can overcome this problem by recording severity either on a momentary basis (\"How bad is your pain right now?\") or by recall over short periods (\"How bad has your pain been today?\"). However, when diary data is collected on paper, it is not known when the ratings are actually made, and there is evidence that compliance may be quite poor. In one study, patients were given an instrumented paper diary that recorded covertly when it was opened. The study showed frequent cases of \"back-filling\", filling in a batch of entries some time, often days, after they were due, and even in some cases of \"forward filling\", completing entries before they were due.\n\nElectronic diaries automatically time-stamp all entries, and can be set up to only allow entry within specified time-windows. This improves compliance, and ensures that true compliance can be documented. Documenting compliance is important if ePRO data are to be used to support regulatory applications. ePRO applications typically achieve compliance rates of over 80%, often over 90%. Electronic diaries also have benefits in that they only allow valid, in-range entries to be made. Devices such as PDAs allow reminders to be given to patients when entries are due. Systems generally transfer data promptly to a central server, allowing tailored feedback to be given to patients. This can also improve compliance. Electronic diaries also eliminate the need for manual editing and entry of data, time-consuming and error-prone processes.\n\nThe other main setting for ePRO is the clinic, with questionnaires completed when patients come in for their scheduled visits. In this supervised situation, compliance is less of an issue. The questionnaires used in site-based ePRO are often longer and more complex than those used in diaries, assessing quality of life and activities of daily living, for example, in some detail. They more often include branching logic (\"if YES continue with the next question, if NO, goto question 34\"). Such branching logic can be handled automatically by the ePRO application, and it is often not necessary for the patient even to know that branching is taking place. This makes it easier for the patient to use.\n\nAs with electronic diaries, the prevention of out of range or inconsistent entries, and elimination of manual editing and data entry are important features of site-based ePRO. Missing data within a questionnaire can be reduced or eliminated, and this is important as missing data has been identified as a crucial quality issue in questionnaire data.\n\nFrom the early years of ePRO there has been concern about whether all patients can cope with computer technology. This is important,as if significant numbers of patients refuse to take part in clinical trials because of dislike of computers then there will be bias in the study population. One of the earliest ePRO studies used a LINC-2 minicomputer to collect patient data. The majority of patients preferred the computer to paper data collection. Similar findings have been reported from many later studies.\n\nElderly patients, and those not familiar with computers, might be expected to have more problems. But these groups also show high acceptance of ePRO, and again often prefer it to paper. Thus there seems to be no great barrier to recruiting representative patient samples in ePRO studies.\n\nEstablishing the validity of an ePRO instrument is in principle no different from that for other methods, such as paper. However most of the instruments in current use have been validated in paper form, and we need to ask (1) whether the paper data can be used to establish validity of the electronic version, and (2) whether data from paper and electronic versions can be used interchangeably.\n\nThe International Society for Pharmacoeconomomics and Outcomes Research (ISPOR) has issued guidelines on establishing equivalence between modes of administration. Their approach is hierarchical, and depends on the degree of change made during the process of migration from paper to electronic format. Three levels are suggested. At the lowest level, where least change has been made, cognitive interviewing of patients as a check that they construe ePRO and paper in the same way is sufficient. This level includes both trivial changes (touch rather than circle a response choice) as well as changes that are supported by empirical findings in the literature. At the second level, equivalence studies comparing the scores obtained from the two modes should be carried out. At the third level, where most change has occurred, the ePRO instrument must be treated as a new instrument, and complete psychometric validation carried out.\n\nThere is a great deal of evidence supporting the general equivalence of paper and ePRO methods. Gwaltney and colleagues have reported a meta-analysis in which they included 46 studies evaluating 278 scales. They concluded that there was good agreement between paper and ePRO, and no evidence of systematic bias. This general finding, of course, does not guarantee that any specific migration will lead to equivalence, and each case must be reviewed and documented.\n\nIt is not always necessary to validate an ePRO measure against a pre-existing paper version. In some cases an instrument may be developed and validated from the beginning in electronic form. More commonly, perhaps, new instruments will be developed in parallel for paper and electronic use, as is the case with the PROMIS (Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System) initiative.\n\nStandards of validity must be maintained throughout every target language population. In order to ensure that developmental standards are consistent in translated versions of an ePRO instrument, the translated instrument undergoes a process known as Linguistic validation in which the preliminary translation is adapted to reflect cultural and linguistic differences between diverse target populations. This process also accounts for any formatting errors that may occur in languages using non-Roman fonts.\n\nSeveral successful regulatory approvals have used ePRO data in recent years, including ketorolac for ocular pain, eszopiclone for insomnia, milnacipran for fibromyalgia, estradiol/levonorgestrel for post-menopausal symptoms, and ruxolitinib for myelofibrosis. In the case of estradiol/levonorgestrel, detailed ePRO data on bleeding/spotting from a one-year clinical trial are presented in the patient information leaflet.\n\nAs well as clinical trial use, ePRO methods may be used to support patients in regular care. An example of this is the collection of symptom data from patients undergoing chemotherapy, using handheld diaries. This allows clinic staff to monitor outpatients, and to identify the occurrence of adverse reactions that may require intervention.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "55086860", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=55086860", "title": "Erika Sutter", "text": "Erika Sutter\n\nErika Sutter (1917-2015) was a Swiss ophthalmologist and a medical missionary in South Africa. She became a lecturer at the International Centre for Eye Health (ICEH) and at the Swiss Tropical Institute. Motivated by her faith, she joined the Swiss Mission in South Africa and worked at the Elim Hospital. She made significant advances against malnutrition and trachoma. She practiced community mobilization and preventive healthcare through establishing a Care Group system. She wrote academic papers and books about her work. She was awarded an honorary doctorate degree by the University of Basel, and the 1984 Woman of the Year.\n\nErika Sutter was born in Basel, Switzerland on June 14, 1917 to Ernst Theodor Sutter and Meta (née Ris). She had a sister Trudi. Her family had a second home in Troistorrents. She was homeschooled until third grade. From fourth grade, she enrolled in Basel girls' high school Gymnasium am Kohlenberg. In 1937, Sutter enrolled in University of Basel and majored in botany and zoology along with minors in geography and physics. She continued studying after her undergraduate years and completed a doctorate in plant physiology in 1952.. She worked at the Institute of Botany during her student years.\n\nAfter considering a teaching career, she worked at Swiss pharmaceutical firm Hoffmann-La Roche in the animal physiology department. In 1948, she worked in the botany department at the Swedish University of Agricultural Sciences in Ultana, where she stayed for two years.\n\nSutter first heard about the Swiss Mission in South Africa from her friend Marie-Louise Martin, who was then working as a high school chaplain in Basel. She contacted the missionaries there to find out about the mission's work. Her plans were halted after the sudden deaths of her father and sister in 1945. Her interest in working for the Swiss Mission was reignited during her time in Sweden. Her encounters with missionaries there compelled her to pursue missionary work, and she left for South Africa in mid-April 1952.\n\nAlthough raised a devout Christian, Dr. Sutter did not see her commitment to missionary service as a religious calling, nor a means to fulfill her personal ambition. She explains in her biography that it was “simply her path”.\n\nFrom 1952 to 1984, Sutter worked at the Elim Hospital as a member of the staff and as an ophthalmologist for around twenty years. During that time, she was responsible for eye services and training of ophthalmic nurses in the hospital. She worked mostly in the Northern Transvaal regions and was involved extensively in preventive health care in the community through the Care Groups. To train to be an ophthalmologist, she returned to Switzerland to study ophthalmology and practice surgical procedures in the Basel Eye Hospital. She returned to the Elim Hospital in 1965 as a certified ophthalmologist. As the only doctor in the eye department, she treated trachoma and various other eye diseases. However, as the eye hospital expanded and more doctors assisted in eye treatments, Sutter was able to direct her focus on achieving other visions.\n\nSutter had wanted to start a nursing school for eye care since she started working in South Africa, and in 1975, her dream was fulfilled when the South African Nursing Council officially recognized their new curriculum and approved the school. At the school, African nurses could be trained and receive an official diploma in ophthalmic nursing. That same year, she also established the Rivoni Society for the Blind, a rehabilitation center that offered workshops and training for the visually impaired and the blind. The society also offered a school for blind children where they could read Braille and learn how to use a typewriter.\n\nIn an effort to reduce cases of trachoma, an eye disease that is easily curable with the application of good hygienic practices, Sutter helped organize Care Groups with Selina Maphorogo, her translator and main motivator of the Care Groups. Care Groups aimed to mobilize local people, mostly women, to spread awareness to local communities about trachoma and how to prevent it. As a result of their efforts, the number of active trachoma cases was reduced by 50% within three years. Care Groups have helped spread awareness and address a wide range of problems such as HIV/AIDS and malnutrition in the region. The project quickly multiplied; by 2002, 10,000 women were working in 300 villages.\n\nOne of Sutter’s most significant publications is \"Hanyane, a Village Struggles for Eye Health,\" an educational book that has been translated into many languages. The book goes into detail about effective preventive care and village development, and documents useful medical notes for ophthalmologists. \n\nHer work \"The Community is my University is\" a compilation of interviews with her and Selina Maphorogo. This book mainly focused on Care Groups and development aid.\n\n\nSutter retired in 1984 at 67 and returned to Basel, Switzerland. In her retirement, she spent most of her time traveling and giving presentations and teaching at the Swiss Tropical Institute in Basel and at the International Centre for Eye Health in England. Dr. Erika Sutter died in 2015 at age 98.\n"}

{"id": "18856018", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=18856018", "title": "Fluoridation by country", "text": "Fluoridation by country\n\nWater fluoridation is the controlled addition of fluoride to a public water supply to reduce tooth decay, and is handled differently by country. Fluoridated water has fluoride at a level that is effective for preventing cavities; this can occur naturally or by adding fluoride. Fluoridated water operates on tooth surfaces: in the mouth it creates low levels of fluoride in saliva, which reduces the rate at which tooth enamel demineralizes and increases the rate at which it remineralizes in the early stages of cavities. Typically a fluoridated compound is added to drinking water, a process that in the U.S. costs an average of about $ per person-year. Defluoridation is needed when the naturally occurring fluoride level exceeds recommended limits. In 2011 the World Health Organization suggested a level of fluoride from 0.5 to 1.5 mg/L (milligrams per litre), depending on climate, local environment, and other sources of fluoride. Bottled water typically has unknown fluoride levels.\nDental caries remains a major public health concern in most industrialized countries, affecting 60–90% of schoolchildren and the vast majority of adults. Water fluoridation reduces cavities in children, while efficacy in adults is less clear. A Cochrane review estimates a reduction in cavities when water fluoridation was used by children who had no access to other sources of fluoride to be 35% in baby teeth and 26% in permanent teeth. Most European countries have experienced substantial declines in tooth decay without its use. Recent studies suggest that water fluoridation, particularly in industrialized countries, may be unnecessary because topical fluorides (such as in toothpaste) are widely used and caries rates have become low.\nAlthough fluoridation can cause dental fluorosis, which can alter the appearance of developing teeth or enamel fluorosis, the differences are mild and usually not considered to be of aesthetic or public-health concern. There is no clear evidence of other adverse effects from water fluoridation. A 2007 Australian systematic review used the same inclusion criteria as York's, plus one additional study. This did not affect the York conclusions. Fluoride's effects depend on the total daily intake of fluoride from all sources. Drinking water is typically the largest source; other methods of fluoride therapy include fluoridation of toothpaste, salt, and milk. The views on the most effective method for community prevention of tooth decay are mixed. The Australian government states that water fluoridation is the most effective means of achieving fluoride exposure that is community-wide. The World Health Organization states water fluoridation, when feasible and culturally acceptable, has substantial advantages, especially for subgroups at high risk, while the European Commission finds no advantage to water fluoridation compared with topical use.\n\nCurrently about 372 million people (around 5.7% of the world population) receive artificially-fluoridated water in about 24 countries, including Australia, Brazil, Canada, Chile, Ireland, Malaysia, the U.S., and Vietnam. With 57.4 million people who receive naturally occurring fluoridated water at or above optimal levels in countries such as Sweden, China, Sri Lanka, Finland, Zimbabwe and Gabon. Community water fluoridation is rare in Continental Europe with 97–98% choosing not to fluoridate drinking water. Fluoridated salt and milk is promoted in some European countries instead. Water fluoridation has been replaced by other modes in many countries where water supplies are too decentralized for it to be a practical choice, or existing natural fluoride levels were already ample, including Germany, Finland, Japan, Netherlands, Sweden, Switzerland, Denmark and at a time Israel. Cessation of water fluoridation has been demonstrated in scientific studies such as a recent one in Calgary, Alberta, to result in increased rates of dental decay. While fluoridation can result in mild dental fluorosis, this effect is barely detectable and causes no concerns with the appearance or health of teeth. Countries practicing artificial water fluoridation vary in their recommended fluoride levels according to what health authorities in each have determined to be most effective for its citizens. The US recently reset the recommended optimal level of fluoride in drinking water because of observed increased Fluorosis levels, likely due to additional fluoride sources like toothpaste and mouthwash which were not present when this level was originally set.\n\nOf Africa's 1.1 billion people, about 400,000 get artificially-fluoridated water (in Libya, data pre-2003).\n\nWater is fluoridated in Egypt, with no recommended minimum value but with a maximum value of 0.4 mg/L.\n\nBefore 2003, 400,000 Libyans were receiving artificially-fluoridated water.\n\nOnly a fraction of Nigerians receive water from waterworks, so water fluoridation affects very few people. A 2009 study found that about 21% of water sources naturally contain fluoride to the recommended range of 0.3–0.6 ppm. About 62% have fluoride below this range.\n\nSouth Africa's Health Department recommends adding fluoridation chemicals to drinking water in some areas. It also advises removal of fluoride from drinking water (defluoridation) where the fluoride content is too high.\n\nLegislation around mandatory fluoridation was introduced in 2002, but has been delayed since then pending further research after opposition from water companies, municipalities and the public.\n\nApproximately 947,000 (7% of the population) receives water with naturally occurring fluoride in it.\n\nRoughly 2,600,000 (21% of the population) receives water with naturally occurring fluoride in it.\n\nFluoridation is banned in China. Naturally high fluoride levels in water are a serious problem in China. As of 2003, there is no water fluoridation in China. Water fluoridation began in 1965 in the urban area of Guangzhou. It was interrupted during 1976–1978 due to the shortage of sodium silico-fluoride. It was resumed only in the Fangcun district of the city, due to objections, and was halted in 1983. The fluoridation reduced the number of cavities, but increased dental fluorosis; the fluoride levels could have been set too high, and low-quality equipment led to inconsistent, and often excessive, fluoride concentrations.\n\nAll Hong Kong residents receive natural occurring fluoride in water, at about half the traditionally-recommended fluoride level. The Water Supplies Department fluoridates rainwater from 17 local reservoirs, in 21 treatment plants. Recent tests showed drinking water to have an average fluoride level of 0.48 mg/L, and a maximum of 0.69 mg/L.\n\nWater fluoridation is not practiced in India. Due to naturally-occurring fluoride, both skeletal and dental fluorosis have been endemic in India in at least 20 states, including Uttarakhand, Jharkhand and Chhattisgarh. The maximum permissible limit of fluoride in drinking water in India is 1.2 mg/L, and the government has been obligated to install fluoride removal plants of various technologies to reduce fluoride levels from industrial waste and mineral deposits. Now reverse osmosis plants are widely used. Household and public system reverse osmosis plants are common in the market. Alleppey in Kerala is most affected with over-fluoridated water. Government-installed reverse osmosis plants supply free filtered water. Rotary International Club, Saratoga USA, helped to install 3 RO Plants in rural Alleppey.\n\n, there are 14,132 habitations in 19 States still containing fluoride above the permissible levels in drinking water. Rajasthan has the highest number of habitations (7,670) with high amount of fluoride in drinking water. Telangana has 1174, Karnataka has 1122 and Madhya Pradesh has 1055 habitation. Assam, Andhra Pradesh, Bihar, Chhattisgarh, Maharashtra, Odisha, West Bengal and Uttar Pradesh also has such habitations.\n\nThe government of India launched the National Programme for Prevention and Control of Fluorosis in 2008–2009. In 2013–2014, the programme was brought under the National Rural Health Mission, which has so far covered 111 districts. The programme includes surveillance of fluorosis in the community, training and manpower support, establishment of diagnostic facilities, treatment and health education. The Indian Council of Medical Research has formed a task force on fluorosis to address issues related to prevention and control.\n\nFluoride was required in water supplies nationwide by legislation passed in 2002, but the requirement was repealed in 2014, and artificial fluoridation was disparaged by national health officials, effectively ending the practice in Israel for a short while. After the election of 2015 the fluoridation program is to be re-debated the new deputy Health Minister Yaakov Litzman.\n\nMekorot, Israel's national water company states, \"In the South of the country, it is unnecessary to add fluoride because it is found naturally in the water.\" Water fluoridation was introduced in Israel's large cities in 1981, and a national effort to fluoridate all the country's water was approved in 1988.\n\nIn 2002, the Union of Local Authorities (ULA) and others petitioned Israel's High Court to stop the Health Ministry from forcing cities to implement water fluoridation. The court soon issued a restraining order, but after half a year ULA withdrew its petition upon the request of the court.\n\nBy 2011, about 65% of the municipalities and local authorities in Israel had agreed to allow fluoridation, and there was active opposition to the spread of fluoridation to the towns where it has not yet been instituted. In 2011, the Health and Welfare Committee of the Knesset criticized the Health Ministry for continuation of water fluoridation.\n\nOn 26 August 2014, Israel officially stopped adding fluoride to its water supplies. According to a Ministry of Health press release statement, the reasons it ended water fluoridation were: \"Only some 1% of the water is used for drinking, while 99% of the water is intended for other uses (industry, agriculture, flushing toilets etc.). There is also scientific evidence that fluoride in large amounts can lead to damage to health. When fluoride is supplied via drinking water, there is no control regarding the amount of fluoride actually consumed, which could lead to excessive consumption. Supply of fluoridated water forces those who do not so wish to also consume water with added fluoride.\" Many in the medical and dental communities in Israel criticized the decision as a mistake.\n\nAfter the election of 2015, the new deputy Health Minister Yaakov Litzman announced that the fluoridation program will be re-debated.\n\nThe first community water fluoridation programme was in Kyoto prefecture in 1952, lasting 13 years. The second was established by US military authorities in Okinawa prefecture in 1957, lasting 15 years. The last experience was in Mie Prefecture in 1967, lasting 4 years.\n\nLess than 1% of Japan practices water fluoridation. Instead, as of March 2010, a total of 7,479 schools and 777,596 preschool to junior high school children were participating in school-based fluoride mouth-rinsing programme (S-FMR), with an estimate of 2,000,000 children participating in 2020.\n\nIn 2005, the ruling Uri Party proposed legislation for compulsory water fluoridation for municipalities. The legislation failed, and only 29 out of around 250 municipal governments had introduced water fluoridation at that time. Fluoridation was proposed again in 2012.\n\nIn 1998, 66% of Malaysians were getting fluoridated water.\n\nIn 2010, Bernama reported, \"Principal Director (Oral Health) in the Health Ministry, Datuk Dr Norain Abu Taib said that only 75.5% of the country's population are enjoying the benefits of water fluoridation\".\n\nIn 1956, Singapore was the first Asian country to institute a water fluoridation program that covered 100% of the population. Water is fluoridated to a typical value of 0.4-0.6 mg per litre.\n\nOnly about 4% of the population of Vietnam has water fluoridation, whereas only 70% get their water from public supplies.\n\nOut of a population of about three-quarters of a billion, under 14 million people (approximately 2%) in Europe receive artificially-fluoridated water. Those people are in the UK (5,797,000), Republic of Ireland (3,250,000), Spain (4,250,000), and Serbia (300,000).\n\nThe first water fluoridation in Europe was in West Germany and Sweden in 1952, bringing fluoridated water to about 42,000 people. By mid-1962, about 1 million Europeans in 18 communities in 11 countries were receiving fluoridated water.\nMany European countries have rejected water fluoridation, including: Austria, Belgium, Finland, France, Germany, Hungary, Luxembourg, Netherlands, Northern Ireland, Norway, Sweden, Switzerland, Scotland, Iceland, and Italy. A 2003 survey of over 500 Europeans from 16 countries concluded that \"the vast majority of people opposed water fluoridation\".\n\nAustria has never implemented fluoridation.\n\nBelgium does not fluoridate its water supply, although legislation permits it.\n\nCzech Republic (previously Czechoslovakia) started water fluoridation in 1958 in Tábor. In Prague fluoridation started in 1975. It was stopped in Prague in 1988 and subsequently in the whole country. Since 2008 no water has been fluoridated. Fluoridated salt is available.\n\nCroatia does not fluoridate its water.\n\nDenmark has released test results for levels of various water contaminants, including fluoride, in the drinking water of some cities: København, Brøndby, Albertslund, Dragør, Hvidovre, Rødovre, Vallensbæk, and Herlev.\n\nThere is no water fluoridation in Estonia. About 4% of the population may be exposed to excessive natural fluoride in drinking waters, and there are measures to remove excess fluoride.\n\nKuopio is the only community in Finland with at least 70,000 people that has ever had water fluoridated. Kuopio stopped fluoridation in 1992. In regions with rapakivi bedrock (small, but densely populated regions), 22% of well waters and 55% of drilled well waters exceed the legal limit of 1.5 mg/l; generally, surface and well waters have 0.5-2.0 mg/l fluoride in affected regions.\n\nFluoridated salt is available in France, and 3% of the population uses naturally fluoridated water, but the water is not artificially fluoridated.\n\nPublic drinking water supplies are not currently fluoridated in any part of Germany, however for children and adolescents use of fluoridated salt and toothpaste, as well as fluoride tablets and washes is strongly encouraged by the German Ministry of Health.\n\nKassel-Wahlershausen in West Germany became the second location in Europe where water fluoridation was practiced in 1952. By 1962, no other part of the FRG was fluoridating, and Kassel-Wahlershausen discontinued the practice in 1971.\n\nIn the GDR (East Germany) in the late 1980s, about 3.4 million people (20%) were receiving water with added fluoride. Fluoride tablets were also provided. The fluoridated areas of the GDR included the towns of Karl-Marx-Stadt (now Chemnitz), Plauen, Zittau, and Spremberg. Children in those towns were part of large long-running studies of caries prevalence. A fluoride cessation study found that consistent with a previously observed population-wide phenomenon that the rate of cavities continued to drop after the fluoride concentration in water fell from the augmented 1.0 ppm to its natural level below 0.2 ppm. Water fluoridation was discontinued after the German reunification.\n\nThere is no water fluoridation in Greece.\n\nIn the early 1960s the city of Szolnok briefly fluoridated its water. The program was discontinued due to technical problems and a public view that fluoridation did not seem reasonable. Hungary has not used artificially fluoridated water since then.\n\nNear the end of 2015, Ireland was the only country in the European Union with a nationwide mandate for water fluoridation.\n\nThe majority of drinking water is fluoridated. In 2012, roughly 3.25 million people received artificially-fluoridated water. Almost 71% of the population in 2002 resided in fluoridated communities. The fluoridation agent used is hydrofluorosilicic acid (HFSA; HSiF). In a 2002 public survey, 45% of respondents expressed some concern about fluoridation.\n\nIn 1957, the Department of Health established a Fluorine Consultative Council which recommended fluoridation at 1.0 ppm of public water supplies, then accessed by approximately 50% of the population. This was felt to be a much cheaper way of improving the quality of children's teeth than employing more dentists. This led to the Health (Fluoridation of Water Supplies) Act 1960, which mandated compulsory fluoridation by local authorities. The statutory instruments made in 1962–65 under the 1960 Act were separate for each local authority, setting the level of fluoride in drinking water to 0.8–1.0 ppm. The current regulations date from 2007, and set the level to 0.6–0.8 ppm, with a target value of 0.7 ppm.\n\nImplementation of fluoridation was held up by preliminary dental surveying and water testing, and a court case, Ryan v. Attorney General. In 1965, the Supreme Court rejected Gladys Ryan's claim that the Act violated the Constitution of Ireland's guarantee of the right to bodily integrity. By 1965, Greater Dublin's water was fluoridated; by 1973, other urban centers were too. Studies from the late 1970s to mid 1990s showed a decrease in (and lower incidence of) dental decay in school children living in areas where water was fluoridated than in areas where water was not fluoridated.\n\nA private member's bill to end fluoridation was defeated in the Dáil on 12 November 2013. It was supported by Sinn Féin and some of the technical group and opposed by the Fine Gael-Labour government and Fianna Fáil.\n\nRecently there is much local opposition to the national fluoridation mandate. Early in 2014, Cork County Council and Laois County Council passed motions for the cessation of water fluoridation. In Autumn 2014, Cork City Council, Dublin City Council, and Kerry County Council passed similar motions.\n\nThere is no water fluoridation in Latvia. Riga's upper limit on natural fluoride is 1.5 mg/l.\n\nWater was fluoridated in large parts of the Netherlands from 1960 to 1973, when the High Council of The Netherlands declared fluoridation of drinking water unauthorized. Dutch authorities had no legal basis for adding chemicals to drinking water if they would not contribute to a sound water supply. Drinking water has not been fluoridated in any part of the Netherlands since 1973.\n\nIn 2000, representatives of the Norwegian National Institute for Public Health reported that no cities in Norway were practicing water fluoridation. There had been intense discussion of the issue around 1980, but no ongoing political discussion in 2000.\n\nAbout 300,000 people in Serbia (3%) were receiving fluoridated water before 2003.\n\nAround 10% of the population (4,250,000 people) receive fluoridated water.\n\nIn 1952, Norrköping in Sweden became one of the first cities in Europe to fluoridate its water supply. It was declared illegal by the Supreme Administrative Court of Sweden in 1961, re-legalized in 1962 and finally prohibited by the parliament in 1971, after considerable debate. The parliament majority said that there were other and better ways of reducing tooth decay than water fluoridation. Four cities received permission to fluoridate tap water when it was legal. An official commission was formed, which published its final report in 1981. They recommended other ways of reducing tooth decay (improving food and oral hygiene habits) instead of fluoridating tap water. They also found that many people found fluoridation to infringe upon personal liberty/freedom of choice by forcing them to be medicated, and that the long-term effects of fluoridation were insufficiently acknowledged. They also lacked a proper study on the effects of fluoridation on formula-fed infants. In the year 2004 the allowed amount of fluoride in the water was decreased to 1,5 mg/l.\n\nIn Switzerland, since 1962, two fluoridation programs had operated in tandem: water fluoridation in the City of Basel, and salt fluoridation in the rest of Switzerland (around 83% of domestic salt sold had fluoride added). However it became increasingly difficult to keep the two programs separate. As a result, some of the population of Basel were assumed to use both fluoridated salt and fluoridated water. In order to correct the situation, in April 2003 the Grand Council of Basel-Stadt resolved to cease water fluoridation and expand salt fluoridation to Basel.\n\nAround 10% of the population of the United Kingdom receives fluoridated water. About half a million people receive water that is naturally fluoridated with calcium fluoride, and about 6 million total receive fluoridated water. The Water Act 2003 required water suppliers to comply with requests from local health authorities to fluoridate their water.\n\nThe following UK water utility companies fluoridate their supply:\n\nEarlier plans were undertaken in the Health Authority areas of Bedfordshire, Hertfordshire, Birmingham, Black Country, Cheshire, Merseyside, County Durham, Tees Valley, Cumbria, Lancashire, North, East Yorkshire, Northern Lincolnshire, Northumberland, Tyne and Wear, Shropshire, Staffordshire, Trent and West Midlands South whereby fluoridation was introduced progressively in the years between 1964 and 1988.\n\nThe South Central Strategic Health Authority carried out the first public consultation under the Water Act 2003, and in 2009 its board voted to fluoridate water supplies in the Southampton area to address the high incidence of tooth decay in children there. Surveys had found that the majority of surveyed Southampton residents opposed the plan, but the Southampton City Primary Care Trust decided that \"public vote could not be the deciding factor and that medical evidence shows fluoridation will reduce tooth decay – and failed to back up claims of serious negative side effects\". Fluoridation plans have been particularly controversial in the northwest of England and have been delayed after a large increase on projected costs was revealed. In October 2014, Public Health England abandoned plans for water fluoridation for 195,000 people in Southampton and neighbouring parts of south-west Hampshire due to opposition from both Hampshire County Council and Southampton City Council.\n\nIt was reported in 2007 that the UK Milk Fluoridation Programme, centered in the northwest of England, involved more than 16,000 children.\n\nThe water supply in Northern Ireland has never been artificially fluoridated except in two small localities where fluoride was added to the water for about 30 years. By 1999, fluoridation ceased in those two areas, as well.\n\nIn 2004, following a public consultation, Scotland's parliament rejected proposals to fluoridate public drinking water.\n\nThe decision whether to fluoridate lies with local governments, with guidelines set by provincial, territorial, and federal governments. Brantford, Ontario became the first city in Canada to fluoridate its water supplies in 1945. In 1955, Toronto approved water fluoridation, but delayed implementation of the program until 1963 due to a campaign against fluoridation by broadcaster Gordon Sinclair. The city continues to fluoridate its water today. In 2008 the recommended fluoride levels in Canada were reduced from 0.8–1.0 mg/L to 0.7 mg/L to minimize the risk of dental fluorosis. Ontario, Alberta, and Manitoba have the highest rates of fluoridation, about 70–75%. The lowest rates are in Quebec (about 6%), British Columbia (about 4%), and Newfoundland and Labrador (1.5%), with Nunavut and the Yukon having no fluoridation at all. Overall, about 45% of the Canadian population had access to fluoridated water supplies in 2007. A 2008 telephone survey found that about half of Canadian adults knew about fluoridation, and of these, 62% supported the idea.\n\nIn 2010, the Region of Waterloo held a non-binding referendum for residents to decide whether water fluoridation should continue. The result of the vote was 50.3% voting against fluoridation. The regional council honored the vote, and over forty years of fluoridation in the city of Waterloo ended in November.\n\nIn 2011, Calgary city council voted 10–3 to stop adding fluoride to the city's drinking water, having started water fluoridation in 1991. A research project has been planned to study the effects of Calgary's cessation, using Edmonton as a control.\n\nOn 28 January 2013, Windsor city council voted 8–3 to cease fluoridation of Windsor's drinking water for five years, honoring a February 2012 recommendation by the Windsor Utilities Commission. Tecumseh gets its water from Windsor, and Tecmuseh's council had voted on 13 March 2012 to ask Windsor to stop fluoridating. Money formerly spent on fluoridation was reallocated to oral health and nutrition education programs. Windsor's water had been fluoridated for over fifty years.\n\nLakeshore and Amherstberg have voted to end water fluoridation.\n\nHamilton, London, and Toronto have recently chosen to continue fluoridation. Toronto treats its water to 0.6 mg/L.\n\nMexico has no water fluoridation program; instead it has a table salt fluoridation program.\n\nAs of May 2000, 42 of the 50 largest U.S. cities had water fluoridation. In 2010, 66% of all U.S. residents and 74% of U.S. residents with access to community water systems receive fluoridated water. In 2010, a U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention study determined that \"40.7% of adolescents aged 12–15 had dental fluorosis [in 1999–2004]\". In response, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services together with the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency are proposing to reduce the recommended level of fluoride in drinking water to the lowest end of the current range, 0.7 milligrams per liter of water (mg/L), from the previous recommended maximum of 0.7 to 1.2 mg/L in recognition of the increase in sources of fluoride such as fluoridated toothpastes and mouthwashes This could effectively terminate municipal water fluoridation in areas where fluoride levels from mineral deposits and industrial pollution exceed the new recommendation.\n\nAustralia now provides fluoridated water for 70% or more of the population in all states and territories. Many of Australia's drinking water supplies began fluoridation in the 1960s and 1970s. By 1984 almost 66% of the Australian population had access to fluoridated drinking water, represented by 850 towns and cities. Some areas within Australia have natural fluoride levels in the groundwater, which was estimated in 1991 to provide drinking water to approximately 0.9% of the population.\n\nThe first town to fluoridate the water supply in Australia was Beaconsfield, Tasmania in 1953. Queensland became the last state to formally require the addition of fluoride to public drinking water supplies in December 2008.\n\nThe use of water fluoridation first began in New Zealand in Hastings in 1954. A Commission of Inquiry was held in 1957 and then its use rapidly expanded in the mid 1960s. New Zealand now has fluoridated water supplied to about half of the total population. Of the six main centers, only Christchurch and Tauranga do not have a fluoridated water supply. Wellington's water supply is mostly fluoridated, but the suburbs of Petone and Korokoro receive a non-fluoridated supply. In Auckland, the suburbs Onehunga and Huia Village don't fluoridate water.\n\nIn 2013, a Hamilton City Council committee voted to remove fluoride from late June 2013. A referendum was held during the council elections in October 2013 with approximately 70% of voters voting for fluoride to be added back into the water supply, and in March 2014, the council voted 9 to 1 to re-introduce fluoride into the supply. In a 2007 referendum about half of voters in the Central Otago, South Otago and the Southland Region did not want fluoridation and voters in the Waitaki District were against water fluoridation for all Wards. Ashburton and Greymouth also voted against fluoridation.\n\nIn 2014, the Prime Minister's Chief Science Advisor and the Royal Society of New Zealand published a report on the health effects of water fluoridation.\n\nIn June 2018, the Supreme Court of New Zealand in \"New Health New Zealand Inc v South Taranaki District Council\" upheld the legality of water fluoridation in New Zealand.\n\nBy 2008, 41% of people (73.2 million) in Brazil were getting artificially-fluoridated water.\n\nWater fluoridation was first adopted in Brazil in the city of Baixo Guandu, ES, in 1953. A 1974 federal law required new or enlarged water treatment plants to have fluoridation, and its availability was greatly expanded in the 1980s, with optimum fluoridation levels set at 0.8 mg/L. Today, the expansion of fluoridation in Brazil is a governmental priority; Between 2005 and 2008, fluoridation became available to 7.6 million people in 503 municipalities. As of 2008, 3,351 municipalities (60.6%) had adopted fluoridation, up from 2,466 in 2000.\n\nIn Chile 70.5% of the population receives fluoridated water (10.1 million added by chemical means, 604,000 naturally occurring). The Biobio Region is the only administrative division that doesn't fluoridate water.\n"}

{"id": "2880676", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2880676", "title": "Greg Pratt", "text": "Greg Pratt\n\nDr. Gregory \"Greg\" Pratt is a fictional character on the United States television show \"ER\", portrayed by Mekhi Phifer from April 4, 2002 to September 25, 2008. Mekhi Phifer was removed from the main cast opening credits in the 2nd episode of season 15.\n\nPratt's first appearance as a main character was late in Season 8 in the episode \"Orion in the Sky\" (2002), as a smart but arrogant intern from VA hospital. He meets Dr. Mark Greene on Greene's last day at County and is initially dismissive of him, before becoming more measured when he learns of Mark's terminal cancer, and by day's end he has learned a little about practicing medicine from Dr. Greene. Dr. Pratt wasn't present at Dr. Mark Greene's funeral but in flashback episode in Season 12 \"Body & Soul\", it revealed Dr. Pratt worked that day at the hospital since it was understaffed with most of the doctors at Dr. Greene's memorial. Pratt later inherits Dr. Greene's locker.\n\nIn the beginning of his residency, Pratt shows immediate leadership and quick precision. But his limited experience and cowboy antics often led Pratt to collide with his chief resident Dr. John Carter and other attendings over many occasions, including a procedure he was unqualified to do (though the patient survived) and resuscitating a patient who had been declared dead, and was brain-dead upon his \"revival\". He initially clashed with med student Michael Gallant as Michael's military background made him more by-the-book whereas Pratt liked to go around the rules, but they later became close friends. During the critical smallpox outbreak, Pratt proved his skills and courage as a swift physician by helping Dr. Luka Kovač and Dr. Jing-Mei Chen save Dr. Romano's life. The entire hospital is thrown into chaos during the evacuation gone awry, and he along with Dr. John Carter, Abby Lockhart, and Dr. Jing-Mei \"Deb\" Chen were forced into quarantine in the ER.\n\nIn Season 9, Pratt begins an off/on relationship with fellow physician, Dr. Jing-Mei \"Deb\" Chen. During the series, it was revealed that Pratt had a mentally handicapped adopted brother named Leon living with him, a man who kept Pratt safe and focused on school during his childhood but was left with the reasoning ability of a small child after surviving a gunshot to the head. Due to his handicap, Leon often got into trouble and would disrupt Pratt's professional and personal life, especially when he became involved with a group of thugs who stabbed him in the buttock over a confiscated gun, got him thrown in jail overnight, and then made him join them on a robbery that ended with one of the thugs dead and a cop badly injured (though he recovered thanks to good surgical work by Dr. Elizabeth Corday). To help give Pratt a break, Carter suggested that Leon leave town for a while, leading Pratt to send his brother away to stay with other family members in Baltimore. Leon never returned to the show and was not mentioned again in future seasons. Pratt and medical student Michael Gallant were briefly held for questioning by the Chicago police after a robbery/homicide occurred at a diner across the street; Chen had said that she might have seen a black man fleeing the scene.\n\nDuring the tenth season, Pratt was supposedly fired by the frustrated Dr. Romano, whom he had been bumping heads with ever since Romano took over the ER. This was based on bogus allegations that Romano was collecting because of his overall dislike of Dr. Pratt, planning to build them up until he had enough ammunition to get rid of Pratt for good. However, Romano never got to present these findings before the hospital director since he never showed up at the conference (unbeknownst to the others, he had been killed minutes earlier by a helicopter that crashed in the ambulance bay and crushed him). Dr. Anspaugh, correctly assuming that Romano was biased, told Pratt to keep up the good work.\n\nPratt and Chen's continuing relationship began to break down when Pratt's casual flirting with new medical student Neela Rasgotra led to Pratt telling Chen he did not see them having a serious future together. Their relationship ended early in Season 10 and Chen was often curt and dismissive towards Pratt for a long while, but they eventually became friends again.\n\nIn Season 10's season finale \"Drive\", Pratt is involved in a road rage shooting while driving a recent patient, Elgin Gibbs, home en route to dinner with Dr. Chen. As Pratt tried to drive away from the shooter, his car was forced off a bridge and into the Chicago river, leading to Pratt sustaining serious head injuries, and Chen suffering a broken leg. Elgin died from his injuries. Their interactions became infrequent due to Chen's family problems, but Pratt went over to her house during Season 11's Christmas Eve episode when he learned she quit. Chen's father begged her to let him die so she injects him with a drug that kills him, and Pratt was aghast by this idea but ultimately supported Chen as she performed euthanasia, and then consoled her as she wept over the loss of her family. This ends his life and Pratt and Chen's relationship, since Chen returns to China to bury her father's remains and is never heard from again.\n\nFor the Chief Resident post that came up in season 11, Pratt was backed at first by Dr. Luka Kovač and later by Dr. Susan Lewis, who had often been critical of his job performance in the past but told him she could see herself backing him for the job. However, he decided against applying for the position due to the extra workload, which was subsequently awarded to Dr. Archie Morris- who, while by no means a bad doctor, was goofy and awkward and had none of Pratt's natural leadership and communications skills.\n\nDr. Pratt came to terms with his clouded past at the end of Season 11, making contact with his estranged father, Charlie Pratt (portrayed by Danny Glover). But, following on in Season 12, Pratt was unable to forgive his father for their estrangement even though proof emerged that Charlie had been forced out of Greg's life by his mom, and ended any reconciliation efforts. Later, after much counsel, Pratt restored ties with his half-brother Chaz (portrayed by Sam Jones III).\n\nIn the episode, \"Strange Bed Fellows,\" Dr. Luka Kovač instructs Pratt to go to Darfur, Africa to join Dr. John Carter in a Doctors Without Borders program after Pratt helped a friend avoid a DUI by sending a vial of his own blood for the blood alcohol test, rather than his friend's; the friend later drove drunk and nearly killed a kid. To avoid legal repercussions and also to force him to think about his actions Dr. Kovač sends him away. When Pratt challenges Kovač and says he won't go, Kovač says he has two choices: leave for Darfur or have the DUI case info released and see his medical career come to an end. Pratt eventually decides to go, giving him the opportunity to move up to the position of attending physician, which Dr. Victor Clemente could not fulfill. Pratt becomes a better doctor for going to Congo as he gets a sense of what it means to push himself under genuinely impossible and horrifying conditions. He sincerely thanks Luka for making him go, and the two doctors are back on good terms afterwards.\n\nAt the start of season 13, Pratt achieved his new title as attending, while Chaz moves in with him after Charlie abuses him and he joins Greg in cutting all ties to his rotten dad. However, later on, Pratt discovers his brother in a compromising position with another man. After much denial and a talk with Dr. Kerry Weaver Pratt begins to understand and accept his brother's homosexuality. He also supports his brother's new job as an Emergency Medical Technician but clashes with Chaz's co-workers after they encourage him to drink near-fatal amounts of alcohol.\n\nLater in the season, Pratt discovered a church holding an illegal prescription drugs exchange program between church members. Pratt tried to reason with the pastor to seek better alternatives. With no compromise being met, he decided to take part in the program to make it safer by donating some narcotics from the ER. However, when a member of the church died from the result of the drug exchange, an investigation was conducted by police and social workers. Pratt soon admitted to his chief, Dr. Kovač, that he was solely involved in the scheme, preventing any repercussions on the department. Pratt was arrested by the police (though Kovač helped bail him out) and was put before the review board at the hospital for an explanation of his actions. Surprisingly, Pastor Watkins of First Mission Baptist and his congregation showed up on Pratt's behalf and explained the entire story of his contribution. The board subsequently dismissed Pratt from any suspension, allowing him to retain his medical license and job. Near the end of the season, Kovač asked Pratt to be best man at his wedding and Greg said yes.\n\nAfter being overlooked for the position of Chief of the ER in favour of new attending Dr. Skye Wexler, Pratt submitted his two weeks' notice of resignation stating that the administration of County General did not respect him; however, he soon changed his mind after meeting former Physician Assistant Jeanie Boulet. After this, Pratt pursued the ER Chief position and finally was able to have a serious adult relationship with the radiologist Dr. Bettina DeJesus.\n\nAt the end of the Season 14 finale, \"The Chicago Way,\" Pratt entered an ambulance transporting a patient (portrayed by Steve Buscemi) who revealed himself to be a government informant in Witness Protection. With a botched attempt made on the patient's life in the ER, the Turkish mob targeting Pratt's patient finally succeeded when they booby trapped the ambulance Pratt rode in. A subsequent explosion resulted in a season-ending cliffhanger.\n\nHe died in the Season 15 premiere, \"Life After Death,\" from injuries sustained in that explosion. Dr Morris tried to save him but unfortunately Pratt was unable to make it. It was further revealed in the episode that Pratt was going to receive an offer to become the new Chief of the ER. Former doctors, such as Dr. Kerry Weaver from Florida and Dr. John Carter from Africa, sent their condolences and gifts in honor of Pratt.\n\nAt the end, Morris hands Bettina the engagement ring which Pratt had intended to give to her. Among the ER staff who came to a remembrance at Ike's bar were Dr. Abby Lockhart, Dr. Archie Morris,Dr. Neela Rasgotra, Tony Gates, Sam Taggart, Simon Brenner, Chuny Marquez, Haleh Adams, Malik McGrath, Frank Martin, Paramedic Dumars, and his brother Chaz, who had become a new med student about halfway through Season 15.\n\nDuring the 15th and final season of \"ER,\" at the end of the episode \"The Book of Abby,\" long-serving nurse Haleh Adams shows the departing Dr. Abby Lockhart a closet wall where all the past doctors and employees have put their locker name tags. Amongst them, a tag \"Pratt\" can be seen.\n"}

This was the lowest average of any European country, according to the OECD. The difference between male life expectancy and female is unusually large. Since 1990 most other European countries have increased their life expectancy by more.\n\nThe annual population growth rate increased by 0.3% in 2007. At 30.4 people per 100,000, Lithuania has seen a dramatic rise in suicides in the post-Soviet years, and now records the third highest suicide rate in the world. Lithuania also has the highest homicide rate in the EU, and the highest rate of death from injury in Europe (76 per 100,000). \n\nAfter independence in 1918 a health care system on the Bismarck model began to develop but in 1949 when it was absorbed into the USSR, it was reorganized according to the centralised Semashko system. It was relatively well funded and the population’s health status was better than in other parts of the USSR. Lithuania moved away from a system funded mainly by local and state budgets to a mixed system, predominantly funded by the National Health Insurance Fund in the late 1990s. The deterioration in health which occurred during the first phase of social reforms was halted in 1994 and the standardized death rate decreased from 12.06 (per 1000 population) in 1994 to 10.16 in 1998.\n\nBy 2000 the vast majority of Lithuanian health care institutions were non-profit-making enterprises and a private sector developed, providing mostly outpatient services which are paid for out-of-pocket. The Ministry of Health also runs a few health care facilities and is involved in the running of the two major Lithuanian teaching hospitals. It is responsible for the State Public Health Centre which manages the public health network including ten county public health centres with their local branches. The ten counties run county hospitals and specialised health care facilities.\n\nTotal expenditure on healthcare per head of the population was $1,579 in 2013, 6.2% of GDP. There were 12191 physicians in the country in 2009, 36.14 per 100,000 population.\n\nThere is now Compulsory Health Insurance for Lithuanian residents. There are 5 Territorial Health Insurance Funds, covering Vilnius, Kaunas, Klaipėda, Šiauliai and Panevėžys. Contributions for people who are economically active are 9% of income.\n\nEmergency medical services are provided free of charge to all residents. Access to hospital treatment is normally by referral by a General Practitioner. Prescribable medicines are listed in the Lithuanian State Medicines Register.\n\n"}

For federal regulation concerning the legal status of the sale of electronic cigarettes products in and outside the United States, see the worldwide regulation of electronic cigarettes.\n\nEffective August 8, 2016, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) mandates electronic cigarettes products to be regulated as tobacco products. The FDA rule also bans sales to minors. The FDA classified e-cigarettes as drug delivery devices and subject to regulation under the Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FDCA) before importation and sale in the US.\n\nVaping is steadily being regulated across the US. Some state and regional governments in the US had extended their indoor smoking bans to include e-cigarettes. , 12 US states and 615 localities had prohibited the use of e-cigarettes in venues in which traditional cigarette smoking was prohibited. High schools and some middle schools throughout the US have been revising their tobacco rules to ban vaping on school grounds.\n\nA review of regulations in 40 US states found that how a law defines e-cigarettes is critical, with some definitions allowing e-cigarettes to avoid smoke-free laws, taxation, and restrictions on sales and marketing. The tobacco industry heavily lobbies states to make it harder to regulate and tax e-cigarettes.\n\nIn August 2016, a World Health Organization (WHO) report recommended that e-cigarettes be banned in indoor areas or where smoking is prohibited. This is because of their potential for non-users to be exposed to chemicals and e-cigarette aerosol in indoor areas. Many local and state jurisdictions have recently begun enacting laws that prohibit e-cigarette usage everywhere that smoking is banned, although some state laws with comprehensive smoke-free laws will still allow for vaping to be permitted in bars and restaurants while prohibiting e-cigarettes in other indoor places. The only states that do not regulate indoor vaping at all, be it by state territory or on a local level, are in the states of Nebraska, Nevada, Rhode Island, and Tennessee.\n\n\nLocalities may regulate vaping indoors, but not in bars and restaurants.\n\n"}

{"id": "13337274", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=13337274", "title": "Mount Hood climbing accidents", "text": "Mount Hood climbing accidents\n\nMount Hood climbing accidents are mountain climbing- or hiking-related incidents on Oregon's Mount Hood. As of 2007, about 10,000 people attempt to climb Mount Hood each year. As of May 2002, more than 130 people have died climbing Mount Hood since records have been kept. One of the worst climbing accidents occurred in 1986, when seven teenagers and two school teachers froze to death while attempting to retreat from a storm.\n\nDespite a quadrupling of forest visitors since 1990, the number of people requiring rescue remains steady at around 25 to 50 per year, largely because of the increased use of cell phones and GPS devices. In 2006, 3.4 percent of search and rescue missions were for mountain climbers. In comparison, 20% were for vehicles (including ATVs and snowmobiles), 3% were for mushroom collectors, the remaining 73.6 percent were for skiers, boaters, and participants in other mountain activities.\n\nRegardless of route, Mount Hood is a technical climb. It requires ropes, crampons, and ice axes. Approximately 95% of Mount Hood's climbs occur April through July.\n\nCascade Range weather patterns can be deceptive, with sudden sustained winds of , and visibility quickly dropping from hundreds of miles to an arm's length; climbers can experience temperature drops in less than an hour after leaving an access point. This pattern is responsible for the most well known incidents of May 1986 and December 2006.\n\nAvalanches are popularly believed a major climbing hazard, but relatively few Mount Hood deaths are attributed to them. For the 11-year period ending April 2006, there was one death on Mount Hood caused by an avalanche,\nwhile 445 avalanche-related deaths occurred throughout North America.\nCompared to other western states, Oregon has relatively few avalanche fatalities (16 of the 1009 for the U.S. from 1951 to 2015).\nThere are between 100 and 200 deaths each year worldwide from avalanches.\n\nThe two major causes of climbing deaths on Mount Hood are falls and hypothermia.\n\nAccording to \"Mount Hood: A Complete History\" by Jack Grauer,\nthe first recorded climbing fatality on Hood's slopes occurred on July 12, 1896, when Frederic Kirn eschewed his guide and attempted the trip to the summit alone. Kirn's body was found on the Newton Clark Glacier on the east side of the mountain, after an apparent 40-story fall in connection with an avalanche.\n\nIn an unusual accident reported in Grauer's book, on August 27, 1934, Victor Von Norman successfully climbed the mountain via the southern route, along with a group of fellow University of Washington students. He then ventured too close to a fumarole between Crater Rock and the \"Hogsback\" that connects Crater Rock with the summit ridge, was overcome by oxygen-barren gases emanating from the fumarole, and fell about to his death. A number of men who tried to retrieve the body over several days were also nearly overcome by the fumes, even after obtaining an oxygen mask, before finally succeeding in their efforts.\n\nIn 1961, experienced climber Colin Chisholm and his teenage son, Doug Chisholm climbed the Elliott Glacier. On the descent of Cooper's Spur a crampon slipped on ice caused a fall. The two fell 2000 feet onto and over crevasses on Elliot Glacier. Colin broke ribs and Doug was unharmed. Their route became known as \"The Chisholm Trail.\" .\n\nOn March 1, 1969, James Eaton died when he fell headfirst into a concealed 60 foot crevasse near the edge of the upper portion of the White River Canyon. Eaton was a ski instructor and a member of the Mount Hood Ski Patrol.\n\nBeginning on New Year's Eve in 1975, two 16-year-olds and an 18-year-old survived in a snow cave for 13 days through a snow storm.\n\nOn May 19, 1980, Tom Hanstedt died while descending the mountain's southeast face, falling deep into a crevasse on the Newton-Clark Glacier. His body was never recovered.\n\nOn June 6, 1981, David H. Turple and Bill Pilkenton died in a fall from Cooper Spur on the northeast side of the mountain.\n\nOn June 21, 1981, five members of the Mazamas climbing group died during a fall from Cooper Spur while descending.\n\nBeginning on May 12, 1986, one of the worst U.S. climbing accidents occurred over the course of three days when seven students and two faculty of the Oregon Episcopal School froze to death during an annual school climb. Of the four survivors, three had life-threatening hypothermia; one had legs amputated.\n\nOn July 11, 1987, Arthur Andersen Jr. was killed when he and two other men fell on the south side of the mountain and slid into a crevasse.\n\nIn June 1990, William Ott died from hypothermia on the mountain. Ott's widow was not surprised to learn of her husband's fate. She said she had not expected her husband, who had terminal cancer, to return from the trip he had chosen to make by himself.\n\nOn September 25, 1995 Kenneth Budlong, 45, of Portland attempted to climb the peak via the Cathedral Ridge route. Budlong was very experienced, having summited the peak 22 times before. However, the weather turned very quickly, and Budlong vanished. Despite an extensive search over the following days, his whereabouts were never determined, and his body was never found.\nOn May 19, 1997, Carlos Loria, a solo climber summited successfully with his dog, Buckwheat. While descending the Coe Glacier he slipped and fell , fracturing his neck. After being reported overdue by family, he was found by rescuers with facial lacerations, slight hypothermia, and cervical trauma. He was treated and helicoptered to Portland, but Buckwheat was not at the scene. A month later, the dog appeared at Cooper Spur Inn, some ENE across the rugged Mount Hood Wilderness, evidently having survived on snow melt and berries.\n\nOn September 6, 1997, an experienced telemark skier, Mark Fraas of Hood River, ascended wearing crampons and carrying skis to the level of Cooper Spur, not intending to summit. He slipped and fell more than down the Chisholm Trail and Eliot Glacier. Twenty-five rescuers responded to his partner's cell phone call and found him dead. Retrieval required technical mountaineering skills and equipment. Fraas was not known to have any climbing experience. This was at least the 13th fatality from Cooper Spur. All involve loss of footing, inability to self-arrest, and a long fall over rock cliffs above the Eliot Glacier.\n\nOn May 31, 1998, during a graduation climb for The Mazamas mountaineering club, several participents were caught in an avalanche. One died and one had serious injuries.\nThe climbers were at the level on the West Crater Rim route; the forecast was for \"significant avalanche danger\" and was posted \"high avalanche hazard\" at Timberline's climbing registration.\nA large slab avalanche fracture occurred at the level, vertical below the westernmost summit ridge.\nA roped team of three were swept down the steep slope through the Hot Rocks area.\nOne was killed by injuries during the fall and found under four feet of snow about an hour later along with a snapped rope.\nThe other two climbers had a fractured pelvis, and fractured ankle, respectively.\nThe leader who was not roped to the other three, was only briefly caught by the avalanche and had injuries to an ankle and shoulder.\n\nOn May 23, 1999, Carey Cardon and Tena Cardon, an experienced pair of climbers summited successfully. Shortly after commencing their descent, one stumbled and both fell more than to their deaths.\n\nOn June 22, 1999, a 24-year-old medical student from Michigan apparently set out from a remote trailhead where his rental car was found. Temperatures dropped 15 degrees and more than an inch of rain fell beginning the next day. Ten days after his presumed disappearance, searching began with up to 70 rescuers combing the area. Additional searches included cadaver dogs and psychics. His body was never found.\n\nOn June 4, 2000, Diana Kornet, 29, slipped as she was looking over the northeast side of Mount Hood. She fell about 2500 ft to her death. She and six friends had reached the summit about 7 am. She had unroped, as many climbers do after reaching the summit, and left her ice axe when she went to take a look. It was windy in this exposed location. After one of her companions called 911, the sheriff's office sent a search plane and found Kornet's body at the 8,700-foot level at the top of Eliot Glacier.\n\nOn September 8, 2001, rescuers abandoned a search for a 24-year-old Hungarian exchange student who had been missing for six days. He had been hiking with friends when he left the group with light clothing and no provisions. Two days after his disappearance, the weather turned cold and snowy.\n\nOn May 24, 2002, a 30-year-old Argentine national attempted to snowboard off Mount Hood's summit along Cooper Spur ridge. He lost control after a few turns and tumbled over to his death.\n\nOn May 30, 2002, three climbers were killed and four others injured when they fell into a crevasse (\"The Bergschrund\") in the \"hogsback\". Most unusual was the televised crash-and-roll of a USAF Pavehawk rescue helicopter from the 304th RQS, which suddenly lost lift. Though the helicopter's five crew members were injured, no one was killed by the crash.\n\nOn March 7, 2003, the search for a man snowshoeing from Timberline Lodge was abandoned after more than four days in heavy winter weather. More than six feet of snow fell during the search. An extensive search five months later for the man's body failed, but unexpectedly discovered the body of another man who was not identified.\n\nOn Thursday, December 7, 2006, three experienced climbers—Kelly James, Brian Hall, and Jerry \"Nikko\" Cooke—began what they expected to be a two-day climb on the more-technical north face gully of the mountain. On Saturday, December 9, 2006, the climbers failed to meet a friend who was scheduled to pick them up at Timberline Lodge. On Sunday, December 10, 2006 James made a cell phone call to his wife, and two older sons telling them that he was trapped in a snow cave and that Brian and Nikko had gone for help. Rescue attempts were forestalled by freezing rain, heavy snowfall, low visibility and winds of , caused by a widespread winter storm. Clear weather on the weekend of December 16 allowed almost 100 search and rescue personnel to scour the mountain. On Sunday, December 17, searchers found what they first believed to be a snow cave and climbing equipment, approximately from the summit. The rescuers found a rope, two ice axes and an insulating sleeping pad. At approximately 3:29 p.m. PST, the body of Kelly James was found in a nearby snow cave. On Wednesday, December 20, 2006, as good weather ended, the Hood River County sheriff announced that the mission was now being treated as a recovery rather than a rescue. Brian Hall and Jerry Cooke remain missing and have been declared dead.\n\nOn the morning of Saturday, February 17, 2007, eight experienced climbers from the Portland area ascended in sunny, mild weather. Observing worse weather mid-afternoon, they camped at the level of Illumination Saddle overnight. Sunday morning, they abandoned a summit attempt and descended in freezing rain and snow, visibility less than , and winds at 40 to 70 mph (64 to 120 km/h). At about noon, disoriented, three of the climbers and a black lab stepped off a cliff (at the level at the east edge of Palmer Glacier) while roped together and fell down several hundred feet into White River Canyon. One of the remaining five climbers was lowered by rope to search for the fallen group, but returned without seeing them. They called for help by cell phone, and were advised of even worse weather advancing, so they dug in expecting another night. However, rescuers arrived and evacuated them Sunday evening. The three fallen climbers were unable to dig into solid ice to build a snow cave, so they improvised a shelter and were in hourly cell phone contact with rescuers. They had a Mountain Locator Unit, sleeping bags, GPS, and a tarp. The dog, Velvet, helped keep them warm. Rescuers arrived Monday about 10:45 am. One was hospitalized for a head injury, the others were treated for minor injuries and released. The dog had broken nails and a cut on one of her back legs from cold exposure.\n\nOn May 12, 2007, five climbers were stranded at the level by whiteout conditions. The climbers contacted rescuers by cell phone and obtained assistance to navigate to \"Illumination Saddle\", on the south side of the mountain. Using their GPS navigation unit, the climbers traversed to the saddle and descended the mountain without further incident. The climbers carried a Mountain Locator Unit, which rescuers could have used to pinpoint their location had they not descended from the mountain on their own.\n\nOn September 7, 2007, in the early afternoon two Portland-area climbers were ascending the Hogsback to the Pearly Gates when one slid to the edge of the Bergschrund and sustained injuries sufficient for him to call for rescue assistance. His partner decided it was too dangerous to descend the frozen gravel and loose rock face and remained in place. Rescuers arrived about five hours later, assessed the fallen climber, treated minor injuries and belayed him walking down. The other climber required technical climbing equipment and was assisted down the Bergschrund. He walked down and joined his partner about dawn at a Timberline snowcat at the top of the ski area.\nOn January 14, 2008, in good weather, two young and experienced climbers intended to ascend the Leuthold Couloir route. When their return was overdue that afternoon, a search and rescue team was activated for the following morning but was turned back by bad weather. At 9 am, cell phone contact was established and rescuers learned they had spent the night below tree line. Rescuers escorted them out two hours later.\nThe climbers were unprepared for bad weather, which arrived as they reached the level. Thinking they had a clear weather window, they had no GPS, nor Mountain Locator Unit, and did not believe their cell phone was usable. Descending with a map and compass, they navigated southward hoping to encounter Timberline Lodge, Government Camp, or the Mount Hood Highway. Not finding either, they reached the level and built a snow cave to spend the night. In the morning, they inadvertently discovered a geocache labeled with coordinates just as a rescue sheriff called their cell phone.\n\nOn October 19, 2008, an inexperienced solo climber fell as he began his descent after summitting. He slipped, leading to an uncontrolled slide of about vertical near Crater Rock. He was unable to arrest his fall using an ice ax, and blacked out after his head struck the surface. Another climber witnessed his fall and rushed to assist, observed head trauma and confusion, and called for help using a cell phone, then descended to meet rescuers. A third climber remained with him until help arrived since the victim was unable to descend on foot. Rescuers arrived a few hours later, applied first aid to stabilize, and called for air evacuation to a Portland hospital. He was treated for cuts and scrapes, and released.\n\nOn January 17, 2009, a search and rescuer on a training exercise was injured when the ice he was climbing collapsed causing him to fall some resulting in severe ankle injuries. Another team member was injured, but was able to walk down. Another rescue team was practicing in the area at the time and assisted the first team.\n\nOn January 21, 2009, a climber died after a temperature inversion likely loosened ice from cliffs above the Hogsback. She tumbled before stopping in a natural depression.\n\nOn February 1, 2009, two men were ascending the Hogsback. Fatigue and poor weather caused them to abort a summit attempt and descend. One lost his balance and fell some before self-arresting, during which he dislocated a shoulder. The other climber called 911 and initiated assistance. Another group of climbers stopped and helped walk the injured climber to the Timberline Ski Area where a snow cat with rescuers awaited.\n\nOn May 17, 2009, a climber received severe injuries to his face, arm and leg in a fall at the 10,600 level of the Hogsback. At least 40 climbers were attempting to summit at the time. The previous day a climber in a group of ten was struck by falling ice. Both climbers were hospitalized.\n\nOn December 13, 2009, rescuers recovered the body of 26-year-old Luke T. Gullberg, of Des Moines, Washington, at about the 9,000-foot level, two days after the trio began climbing an especially treacherous face of the mountain. On August 26, 2010, after several days of a renewed search effort, Portland Mountain Rescue recovered the bodies of Anthony Vietti and Katie Nolan, still tied together.\nOn June 16, 2010, five climbers with ski gear hiked up Snow Dome, a popular wilderness back country area on the north side, intending to ski down. Bad weather rolled in causing poor visibility and strong winds. One climber, Robert Dale Wiebe from Canada, was separated and accidentally traversed Coe Glacier where he apparently fell to his death.\n\nOn July 7, 2010, a 25-year-old male climber had successfully summited. During the initial descent, he lost footing near Hot Rocks and was unable to stop, injuring his knee and elbow. Nearby climbers provided first aid until rescuers and paramedics arrived and stabilized him. He was loaded into a sled and lowered down with an improvised arrangement of rope and pulley systems.\n\nOn July 24, 2010, a 54-year-old male from Arizona fell from the Hogsback and fractured or dislocated an ankle and received abrasions from sliding down granular ice. The victim was airlifted to a Portland hospital.\n\nOn January 22, 2011, three friends summited successfully in the afternoon, but one broke his crampon during descent. At 5 p.m., his partners continued down without him separating from him at Crater Rock. They notified authorities when he did not return, reporting he lacked a light and overnight gear though he had \"a beacon\" from REI, but did not know what it was, but said he would \"pull the knob\" if something happened. The sheriff called for search assistance, and since Portland Mountain Rescue was already in the area for a winter bivouac exercise, they conducted an MLU search at 8 p.m. and quickly identified a signal from White River Canyon. It was a clear night near freezing with winds at . Night ski lighting from Skibowl and Timberline was clearly visible when they located the victim east of Palmer Glacier at around midnight in light garments. They treated with warm clothing, liquids, and heat packs and took him back to Timberline.\n\nLate on February 20, 2011, a snowboarder was reported lost on Mount Hood. Initial information and cell phone tracking indicated he was northwest of Zig Zag Canyon. Five searchers were unable to find him that night though visibility improved during the evening. The next morning had better conditions and involved many more searchers. He was found by a National Guard helicopter, which airlifted him to Timberline Lodge, cold but in good spirits. As rescuers were debriefing with a sheriff, a call for assistance arrived from a 13-year-old male snowboarder who was out-of-bounds below the Timberline Ski area. He was found within 20 minutes of the call, given hot drink and food, and escorted to Timberline's first aid room.\n\nOn February 7, 2012, experienced climber Jared Townsley, 31 or 32, of Tigard, Oregon, was found dead at the 9,200 foot level at the base of a cliff with injuries consistent with a severe fall. With as many as 12 to 15 Mount Hood summits, he began climbing around midnight Sunday, February 5, a common tactic to summit at dawn. Other climbers reported seeing him descending near Crater Rock at 8:30 a.m. When he did not return as planned by 11 a.m., volunteers searched throughout the night in mild temperatures, light wind, and with a full moon and found his body Tuesday morning.\nAt about 5:20 a.m. on June 14, 2012, solo climber Mark Cartier, 56, of Portland, Oregon, died due to injuries sustained by falling from a point above and west of the Hogsback (around the 11,000-foot level) into the Hot Rocks area west of Crater Rock. He was descending the mountain at the time of the fall and reportedly slid 1,000 feet out of control, coming to rest amid a large debris field. His body was recovered by rescuers just before 1 p.m. Weather was good but the freezing level was at about 10,000 feet, contributing to dicey surface conditions. Cartier was an experienced rock climber, climbed mountains around the world, and had summited Mount Hood hundreds of times.\n\nOn Sunday, March 24, 2013, college student Mary Owen set out in the early morning hours to complete a solo climb. She was supposed to be a part of a group climb, but when the leader of her group canceled the climb due to what he thought would be bad weather, Owen decided to climb alone. As she climbed higher, whiteout conditions set in, and approximately 1000 vertical feet from the summit she decided to turn back. Disoriented due to the conditions she became lost and, attempting to climb out of canyon, she slipped and fell about 40 feet, severely spraining her right ankle and suffering a puncture wound to her inner left thigh. Unable to walk, she was stranded on the mountain for six nights, surviving on a one day's worth of snacks. Though she registered to climb, some mishap caused her information to be lost and she was not reported missing until Thursday, March 28. She was found alive on Saturday, March 30, by an Oregon Army National Guard Blackhawk helicopter rescue crew and flown directly to a hospital. Aside from her ankle injuries, she suffered frostbite in her feet and toes, but recovered fully.\n\nOn June 22, 2013, experienced climber Dr. Kinley Adams, a Salem family dentist, set out for a day climb as part of training preparation for a planned climbing trip to Nepal. He parked and registered at Timberline, and set out solo, but did not return as planned at 3:30 p.m. Searching began at 5:00 a.m. the next day, but was limited by low clouds, light rain, and worsening weather, which turned to winter conditions for the next few days. Search and rescue aircraft found his body a week later, and it was recovered the following day by a highly technical mission due to dangerous snow and slope conditions. Death occurred from multiple injuries caused by falling.\n\nJuly 23, 2013, Cole Hancock, age 10, hiking with his dad, Kim Hancock, fell 150 feet off of a cliff on Mount Hood. Brain damaged, initially, Cole couldn't speak one word, but two days later was speaking in whole sentences. He was treated at Doernbecher Children's Hospital.\n\nOn August 3, 2013, six snowboarders were scouting a location to shoot video. They were exploring an area of White River Glacier at about elevation when they found a natural tunnel in ice and walked through it. The first, Collin Backowski, 25, a coach at High Cascade Snowboard Camp from Pine, Colorado, was caught by the tunnel collapsing. The other five avoided injury. Backowski's body was recovered the next day.\n\nOn August 12, 2013, 32-year-old Sebastian Kinasiewicz of Poland apparently summited from the Tilly Jane trailhead on the northeast side of the mountain, but fell to his death near the summit.\n\nMay 14, 2014, a priest (Father Robert Cormier, age 57, of St. Patrick's and Assumption All Saints in Jersey City, New Jersey) fell 1,000 feet to his death on Mt. Hood.\n\nOn June 4, 2015, Ward Milo Maxfield, a 66-year-old experienced climber from Paul, Idaho was leading his 17-year-old grandson and a group other climbers when he fell 400 feet to his death.\n\nOn May 7, 2017, John Thorton Jenkins, a 32-year-old experienced climber from Seattle, WA was heading for the summit when he slid down steep terrain near the Hogsback. He sustained serious injuries and was treated by search and rescue teams, who had him flown to a Portland hospital, but he was pronounced dead on arrival at the hospital.\n\nOn August 12, 2017, two 19-year-old college students, Emma Place and Emily Lang, apparently fell to their deaths off a Pacific Crest Trail cliff. The women had set up camp at the top of a waterfall, with a tent and backpacks. It appeared that they lost their footing on the slippery rocks and fell. The two had met in 2008 as students at Laurelhust Elementary in Portland and became best friends. They graduated from St. Mary's Academy in 2016. Each had completed her freshman year—Place at Gonzaga University and Lang at Western Washington University.\nOn February 13, 2018, 35-year-old Miha Sumi of Portland fell 700-1,000 feet on Hogsback, was critically injured, rescued and subsequently died. Sumi was among a group of four climbers; Sumi and Matt Zavortink had reached the summit, while the other two waited on Hogsback. The group encountered tumbling ice and rocks, causing Sumi's fall. Zavortink and other climbers in the area reached Sumi and performed CPR for about 90 minutes until a Blackhawk helicopter arrived and rescued him. He was flown to Legacy Emanuel Medical Center in Portland but was declared dead upon arrival.\n"}

{"id": "2385442", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2385442", "title": "Personal health record", "text": "Personal health record\n\nA personal health record, or PHR, is a health record where health data and other information related to the care of a patient is maintained by the patient. This stands in contrast to the more widely used electronic medical record, which is operated by institutions (such as hospitals) and contains data entered by clinicians (such as billing data) to support insurance claims. The intention of a PHR is to provide a complete and accurate summary of an individual's medical history which is accessible online. The health data on a PHR might include patient-reported outcome data, lab results, and data from devices such as wireless electronic weighing scales or (collected passively) from a smartphone.\n\nThe term \"personal health record\" is not new. The term was used as early as June 1978, and in 1956, there was a reference was made to a \"personal health log.\" The term \"PHR\" may be applied to both paper-based and computerized systems; usage in the late 2010s usually implies an electronic application used to collect and store health data. \n\nIn the early 2000s, healthcare organizations began to propose formal definitions of the term. For example:\n\nIt is important to note that PHRs are not the same as electronic health records (EHRs) or electronic medical records (EMRs), which are software systems designed for use by health care providers. Like the data recorded in paper-based medical records, the data in EHRs are legally mandated notes on the care provided by clinicians to patients. However, generally there is no mandate requiring patients to track their own health data. Like EHRs and EMRs, PHRs may still fall under the regulatory scope of governments, depending on their origin, but rigorous regulatory protection of their data is still lacking in parts of the world.\n\nPHRs can contain a diverse range of data, including but not limited to:\nThere are two methods by which data can arrive in a PHR. A patient may enter it directly, either by typing into fields or uploading/transmitting data from a file or another website. The second is when the PHR is tethered to an electronic health record, which automatically updates the PHR. Not all PHRs have the same capabilities, and individual PHRs may support one or all of these methods.\n\nIn addition to storing an individual's personal health information, some PHRs provide added-value services such as drug-drug interaction checking, electronic messaging between patients and providers, managing appointments, and reminders.\n\nPHRs grant patients access to a wide range of health information sources, best medical practices, and health knowledge. All of an individual’s medical records are stored in one place instead of paper-based files in various doctors’ offices. Upon encountering a medical condition, a patient can better access test results, communicate with their doctors, and share information with others suffering similarly.\n\nMoreover, PHRs can benefit clinicians. PHRs offer patients the opportunity to submit their data to their clinicians' EHRs. This may help clinicians make better treatment decisions by providing more continuous data, resulting in improved efficiency in care. However, some physicians may have concerns about patient-entered information and its accuracy, as well as whether the added patient engagement creates more unreimbursable work.\n\nPHRs have the potential to help analyze an individual’s health profile and identify health threats and improvement opportunities based on an analysis of drug interaction, current best medical practices, gaps in current medical care plans, and identification of medical errors. Patient illnesses can be tracked in conjunction with healthcare providers, and early interventions can be promoted upon encountering deviation of health status. PHRs also make it easier for clinicians to care for their patients by facilitating continuous communication as opposed to episodic. Eliminating communication barriers and allowing documentation flow between patients and clinicians in a timely fashion can save time consumed by face-to-face meetings and telephone communication. Improved communication can also ease the process for patients and caregivers to ask questions, to set up appointments, to request refills and referrals, and to report problems. Additionally, in the case of an emergency a PHR can quickly provide critical information to proper diagnosis or treatment.\n\nLike other health information technology, PHR architecture can be roughly organized into three main components\n\nArchitecture types remain various. However, in 2017, Roehrs \"et al.\" performed a systematic literature review of PHRs and were able to divide architecture types into two groups: model-based and coverage-based. Model architectures represent more traditional takes on PHRs, including health data that is still stored on paper. Coverage architectures represent more hybrid takes on the PHR, \"with the PHR distributed inside and outside the health care organizations\" based on the data's physical location. The associated architectural types have different costs and benefits. Likewise, stand-alone, provider-tethered, and payer-tethered PHRs have different advantages and disadvantages for patients related to their individual circumstances. Such differences are among the priority areas in PHR research. As PHRs may play a key role in advancing health information exchange, interoperability with other health IT systems is an important consideration for PHR architecture. Additionally, PHR systems requires users to put forth an \"'ongoing' effort to keep their account up to date\" (maintain an active role in managing their own health), which in turn requires further examination of PHR architecture and adoption models by developers.\n\nOne of the principal distinguishing features of a PHR is the platform by which it is delivered. The types of platforms include: paper, electronic device, and web.\n\nPersonal health information is recorded and stored in paper format. Printed laboratory reports, copies of clinic notes, and health histories created by the individual may be parts of a paper-based PHR. This method is low cost, reliable, and accessible without the need for a computer or any other hardware. Probably the most successful paper PHR is the hand-held pregnancy record, developed in Milton Keynes in the mid-1980s and now in use throughout the United Kingdom. These include the Scottish Woman-Held Maternity Record, All Wales Maternity Record, and Perinatal Institute notes.\nPaper-based PHRs may be difficult to locate, update, and share with others. Paper-based PHRs are subject to physical loss and damage, such as can occur during a natural disaster. Paper records can also be printed from most electronic PHRs. However, Fawdry \"et al.\" have shown that paper records are extremely flexible and do have distinct advantages over rigid electronic systems.\n\nPersonal health information is recorded and stored in personal computer-based software that may have the capability to print, backup, encrypt, and import data from other sources such as a hospital laboratory. The most basic form of a PC-based PHR would be a health history created in a word-processing program. The health history created in this way can be printed, copied, and shared with anyone with a compatible word processor.\n\nPHR software can provide more sophisticated features such as data encryption, data importation, and data sharing with health care providers. Some PHR products allow the copying of health records to a mass-storage device such as a CD-ROM, DVD, smart card, or USB flash drive.\n\nPC-based PHRs are subject to physical loss and damage of the personal computer and the data that it contains. Some other methods of device solution may entail cards with embedded chips containing health information that may or may not be linked to a personal computer application or a web solution.\n\nWeb-based PHR solutions are essentially the same as electronic device PHR solutions, however, web-based solutions have the advantage of being easily integrated with other services. For example, some solutions allow for import of medical data from external sources. Solutions including HealthVault, and PatientsLikeMe allow data to be shared with other applications or specific people. Mobile solutions often integrate themselves with web solutions and use the web-based solution as the platform.\n\nA large number of companies have emerged to provide consumers the opportunity to develop online PHRs. Some have been developed by non-profit organizations, while others have been developed by commercial ventures. These web-based applications allow users to directly enter their information such as diagnosis, medications, laboratory tests, immunizations and other data associated with their health. They generate records that can be displayed for review or transmitted to authorized receivers.\n\nDespite the need for PHRs and the availability of various online PHR providers, there has not been wide adoption of PHR services. In fact, Google, being among the most innovative companies in the world, discontinued its PHR service called Google Health on January 12, 2012. The reason cited for shutting down Google Health was that the service did not translate from its limited usage into widespread usage in the daily health routines of millions of people. Surveys of web-based services have found wide variations in functions between services and only limited data on efficacy and safety concerns. One analyst, describing the public's reluctance to adopt the services, called PHRs \"a technology in search of a market.\"\n\nAn emerging standard from HL7, Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources (FHIR), is designed to make it easier for developers of personal health record applications to access relevant medical records.\n\nThe terms electronic health records, personal health records, and patient portals are not always used correctly. The generally agreed upon definition of these terms relates mainly to the \"ownership\" of the data. Once data is in a PHR it usually owned and controlled by the patient. Most EHRs, however, are the property of the provider, although the content can be co-created by both the provider and patient. A patient has a legal right in most states to request their healthcare data and under recent USA legislation those providers using a certified EHR will be required to provide an electronic copy as well. In the UK, according to the governments's information strategy for the NHS every primary care practice in England will have to offer patients online access to their care records by 2015. In 2012, only 1% did so. Electronic health records and electronic medical records contain clinical data created by and for health professionals in the course of providing care. The data is about the patient but the data resides in a health care provider's system. The patient portal is typically defined as a view into the electronic medical records. In addition, ancillary functions that support a health care provider's interaction with a patient are also found in those systems e.g. prescription refill requests, appointment requests, electronic case management, etc. Finally, PHRs are data that resides with the patient, in a system of the patient's choosing. This data may have been exported directly from an EMR, but the point is it now resides in a location of the patient's choosing. Access to that information is controlled entirely by the patient.\n\nA new concept being discussed is the UHR or \"universal health record\", which would be a patient-centered and patient-controlled body of information that could be shared in a granular way with particular health care providers at the patient's discretion in support of the patient's work with health care providers. This project would enlist open source contributions and enhancements from developers, with particular emphasis on supporting patient expectations of privacy and responsible patient control of private health information (PHI).\n\nWhile PHRs can help patients keep track of their personal health information, the value of PHRs to healthcare organizations is still unclear.\n\nSince the National Academy of Medicine (previously the Institute of Medicine) called for greater adoption of PHRs in 1999, the software has faced many barriers to adoption, including economic, technological, regulatory, behavioral, and organizational issues at both the environmental and individual levels. A study from 2002 was carried out in an effort to assess the functionality and utility of the budding online PHR. It found that most people did not keep record of minute details of their healthcare experiences and therefore made it difficult to get full value from web-based PHRs. The PHRs selected for evaluation offered limited functionality to the general public, with limitations in data entry, validation, and information display methods. A 2005 survey found that limited access to computers and the internet access, as well as low computer literacy levels, known as the digital divide, was a barrier for low-income and aged populations. A 2010–11 set of interviews of clinicians and patients found \"that both usability concerns and socio-cultural influences are barriers to PHR adoption and use.\" More recent studies and reviews in the mid- to late 2010s have revealed other issues such as privacy and confidentiality concerns, lack of motivation, low health literacy, health- and disease-related disabilities, and even administrative burdens. \n\nAdditionally, how the PHR is promoted by healthcare organizations, how useful their features are, and how well the care provider uses it, particularly in the realm of patient communication, can influence adoption and usage rates. Promotion may occur at several steps of the development and implementation process, from developers talking with providers about a proposed system, clinics forming patient focus groups, and providers posting physical and digital news of the PHR to patients. The features and usability of the system also drive adoption, with groups such as Kaiser Permanente and Cleveland Clinic seeing substantial increases in PHR use when adding the features users want. Provider use and communication has also proved important; \"[s]ecure communication with the physician is important because the patients will eventually leave (the PHR) if there is no conversation going on with the physician.\" Additional studies have also show that when put to use, PHR's ability to enhance communication and collaboration can change patient patterns from sporadic visits to steady visits, and more significant PHR use.\n\nOne of the most controversial issues for PHRs is how the technology could threaten the privacy of patient's protected health information (PHI). Network computer break-ins are becoming more common, thus storing medical information online can cause fear of the exposure of health information to unauthorized individuals. In addition to height, weight, blood pressure and other quantitative information about a patient's physical body, medical records can reveal very sensitive information. This includes fertility, surgical procedures, emotional and psychological disorders, and diseases, which many patients are reluctant to share even voluntarily. \n\nVarious threats exist to patient information confidentiality:\n\n\nTechnological and regulatory issues play important roles in the privacy, security, and patient concerns surrounding PHI. On the technological side, failures occur at numerous points:\n\n\nThe state of PHR regulations are also worth mentioning. A 2018 review and comparison of five legislative jurisdictions around the world found \"considerable variances with regards to legal terminology and the degree of compliance required from entities offering PHR services across various jurisdictions.\" Even in the European Union, which provides some of the most significant protections to PHR data through the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), the reviewers found \"significant room for interpretation and a degree of ambiguity in key areas.\" With further questions arising about the security and privacy of PHI that makes its ways to expanding platforms such as smartphones and associated applications, clearer regulations and policies will likely be required.\n\nPHRs have the potential to benefit the public health sector in areas such as health monitoring, outbreak monitoring, empowerment through information and resources, linking to services, and research. However, tapping into this potential has been a slow process due to both the public health sector not fully engaging with adopters and the adopters themselves exhibiting \"reticence to share sensitive information.\" Several surveys of Americans in the twenty-first century have indicated that anywhere between 63 to 73% would be willing to share at least some personal health information with public health officials for detecting disease outbreaks and other purposes. However, caveats about retaining control of how the information is presented and used remain strong among respondents, with concerns about anonymity, government insensitivity, and discrimination. Given the questionable state of regulatory efforts to protect PHR data from these and other concerns, the standard use of health data from PHRs in public health may still be far away.\n\nThe U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has taken the idea of PHR integration with public health efforts a step further, in 2016 suggesting a framework for a community health record \"for integrating and transforming multisector data into actionable information.\" Integration of EHR, PHR, and county health data would allow the integration and presentation of data across residential blocks to entire zip codes. However, like PHR, significant social approval would have to occur, and data use agreements would have to be established.\n\n\n\n"}

The theoretical case for a significant role of rare variants is that alleles that strongly predispose an individual to disease will be kept at low frequencies in populations by purifying selection. Rare variants are increasingly being studied, as a consequence of exome and whole genome sequencing efforts. While these variants are individually infrequent in populations, there are many in human populations, and they can be unique to specific populations. They are more likely to be deleterious than common variants, as a result of rapid population growth and weak purifying selection. They have been suspected of acting independently or along with common variants to cause disease states.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "13319153", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=13319153", "title": "Religious views on smoking", "text": "Religious views on smoking\n\nReligious views on smoking vary widely. Indigenous peoples of the Americas have traditionally used tobacco for religious purposes, while Abrahamic and other religions have only been introduced to the practice in recent times due to the European colonization of the Americas in the 16th century.\n\nWith the exception of a few Christian denominations, the Abrahamic religions originated before tobacco smoking was introduced to Europe from the New World. Therefore, these religions do not address it in their foundational teachings; however, modern practitioners have offered interpretations of their faith with regard to smoking.\n\nJohann Sebastian Bach was known to enjoy smoking a pipe, and wrote poetry on how doing so enhanced his relationship with God. In the 19th century, smoking was considered as inappropriate by certain Christians. In the autumn of 1874 George Frederick Pentecost got into the so-called Daily Telegraph scandal: a smoking controversy, over which his counterpart Charles Spurgeon, known as the 'prince of preachers', was exploited by the tobacco industry. Tobacco was listed, along with drunkenness, gambling, cards, dancing and theatre-going, in J.M. Judy's \"Questionable Amusements and Worthy Substitutes\", a book featuring anti-smoking dialogue which was published in 1904 by the Western Methodist Book of Concern.\n\nThough there is no official canonical prohibition regarding the use of tobacco, the more traditional among the Eastern Orthodox Churches forbid their clergy or monastics to smoke, and the laity are strongly encouraged to give up this habit, if they are subject to it. One who smokes is considered to be polluting the \"Temple of the Holy Spirit\" (i.e., the body), which has been sanctified by the reception of the Sacred Mysteries (Sacraments). (The view of the body being the \"temple of the Holy Spirit\" is also common in Protestant circles, and is quoted as a basis against not only tobacco use, but recreational drugs, eating disorders, sexual immorality, and other vices which can be harmful to the body. The Bible reference is I Corinthians 6:7-20.) In Orthodox cultures, various derogatory terms have developed to describe smoking, such as \"incense of Satan\". Father Alexander Lebedeff described the Orthodox approach as follows:\nThe Roman Catholic Church does not condemn smoking, but considers excessive smoking to be sinful, as described in the Catechism (CCC 2290):\nJehovah's Witnesses have not permitted any active members to smoke since 1973, and their literature has warned about physical and spiritual dangers of smoking.\n\nThe Seventh-day Adventist Church also requires its members to abstain from tobacco use. It has called for governments to enact policies that include \"a uniform ban on all tobacco advertising, stricter laws prohibiting smoking in non-residential public places, more aggressive and systematic public education, and substantially higher taxes on cigarettes.\"\n\nThe founder of the Latter Day Saint movement, Joseph Smith, recorded that on February 27, 1833 he received a revelation which addressed tobacco use. It is commonly known as the Word of Wisdom, found in section 89 of the Doctrine and Covenants, and prohibits the smoking or chewing of tobacco. () While initially viewed as a guideline, this was eventually accepted as a commandment by The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. The Word of Wisdom is also practiced to various degrees by other Latter Day Saint denominations.\n\nThe first fatwas discouraging the use of tobacco dates from 1602. In recent years, tobacco fatwas (Islamic legal pronouncements) have been issued due to health concerns.\n\nThe holy book of Islam, the Qur'ān, does not specifically prohibit or denounce smoking, but gives behavioral guidance:\n\n\nIn practice, at least one recent survey (Abbottabad, Pakistan) found that observant Muslims tend to avoid smoking. A study of young Muslim Arab-Americans found that Islamic influences were correlated with some diminished smoking. Conversely, an Egyptian study found that knowledge of an anti-smoking fatwa did not reduce smoking. Overall, the prevalence of smoking is increasing in Islamic countries.\n\nThe prominent scholar Yusuf al Qaradawi argues that smoking is no longer an issue of dispute among Islamic scholars due to the knowledge of health risks.\n\nThe reported juristic disagreement among Muslim scholars on the ruling concerning smoking, since its appearance and spread, is not usually based on differences between legal proofs, but on the difference in the verification of the cause on which the ruling is based. They all agree that whatever is proved to be harmful to the body and mind is prohibited, yet they differ whether this ruling applies to smoking. Some of them claimed that smoking has some benefits, others assured that it had few disadvantages compared to its benefits, whereas a third group maintained that it had neither benefits nor bad effects. This means that if scholars had been certain about the harmfulness of smoking, then they would undoubtedly have considered it prohibited.[…]\n\nSecond: Our inclination to consider smoking prohibited does not mean that it is as grave as major sins like adultery, drinking alcohol or theft. In fact, prohibited matters in Islam are relative; some of them are minor prohibitions whereas others are major, and each has its own ruling. The major sins, for example, have no expiation other than sincere repentance. However, the minor sins can be expiated by the Five Prayers, the Friday Prayer, the Fasting of Ramadan, the Night Vigil Prayer in Ramadan, and other acts of worship. They can also be expiated by avoiding the major sins.\n\nAll contemporary rulings tend to condemn smoking as potentially harmful or prohibit (haram) smoking outright as a cause of severe health damage. Arab Muslims tend to prohibit smoking (despite Saudi Arabia ranking 23rd in the world for the percentage of its population that smokes) and, in South Asia, smoking tends to be considered lawful but discouraged:\n\nIn many parts of the Arabic speaking world, the legal status of smoking has further changed during recent years, and numerous religious edicts or fatawa, including from notable authorities such as Al-Azhar University in Egypt, now declare smoking to be prohibited. The reasons cited in support of the reclassification of smoking as prohibited include Islamic law's general prohibition of all actions that result in harm. For example, the Qur’an says, \"And spend of your substance in the cause of God, and make not your own hands contribute to your own destruction (2; 195).\" Additionally, jurists rely on the exhortations in the Qur’an not to waste money. Greater appreciation of the risks associated with passive smoking, has also led recent jurists to cite the obligation to avoid causing willful annoyance, distress, or harm to other people.\nFrom the 1970s to the late 1990s, tobacco companies including British American Tobacco and Phillip Morris were involved in campaigns to undermine fatwas against smoking in Muslim majority countries by branding Muslims who opposed smoking as a fundamentalist'? who wishes to return to sharia law\", and be \"a threat to existing government\". The tobacco industry was also concerned that the World Health Organization's encouraging of anti-smoking stance of Muslim scholars. A 1985 report from tobacco firm Philip Morris squarely blamed the WHO: \"This ideological development has become a threat to our business because of the interference of the WHO ... The WHO has not only joined forces with Muslim fundamentalists who view smoking as evil, but has gone yet further by encouraging religious leaders previously not active anti-smokers to take up the cause.\"\n\nEarly on in the Hasidic movement, the Baal Shem Tov taught that smoking tobacco can be used as a religious devotion, and can even help bring the Messianic Era. Rabbi Levi Yitchak of Berditchev is quoted as saying that \"a Jew smokes on the weekdays and sniffs tobacco on the Sabbath\". Rabbi Dovid of Lelov taught that it is a good religious practice to smoke on Saturday nights after the Sabbath, and this practice is followed by the Rebbes of Lelov and Skulen, however the current Rebbe of Skulen discourages people from following his example, in light of current views opposing smoking, and he himself only takes a few brief puffs of a cigarette after Havdalah. Many Hasidic Jews smoke, and many who do not smoke regularly will smoke on the holiday of Purim, even if they do not do so any other time of the year, and some consider it to be a spiritual practice, similar to the smoke of the altar in the ancient Temple. However, in recent years, many Hasidic Rabbis have come out against smoking, as have rabbis of other movements.\n\nRabbi Yisrael Meir Kagan (1838–1933) was one of the first Jewish authorities to speak out on smoking. He considered it a health risk and a waste of time, and had little patience for those who claimed addiction, stating that they never should have started smoking in the first place (\"Likutei Amarim\" 13, \"Zechor le-Miriam\" 23).\n\nA shift toward health-oriented concerns may be observed in different rabbinic interpretations of Jewish law (\"halakha\"). For instance, at a time when the link between smoking and health was still in doubt, Rabbi Moshe Feinstein issued an influential opinion in 1963 stating that smoking was permitted, although still inadvisable. (\"Igrot Moshe\" Y.D. II:49)\n\nMore recently, rabbinic responsa tend to argue that smoking is prohibited as self-endangerment under Jewish law and that smoking in indoor spaces should be restricted as a type of damage to others. The self-endangerment rule is grounded partly on a Biblical verse that is read as an injunction to watch one's health - \"ונשמרתם מאד, לנפשתיכם\" [Vi'nish'martem Me'od Li'naf'sho'tey'chem] \"And you shall watch yourselves very well...\" Similarly, rabbinic rules against damaging others are traced back to Biblical and Talmudic laws.\n\nFamous Ashkenazi Haredi rabbis have called on people not to smoke and called smoking an 'evil habit.' These rabbis include Rabbi Yosef Sholom Eliashiv, Rabbi Aharon Leib Shteinman, Rabbi Moshe Shmuel Shapiro, Rabbi Michel Yehuda Lefkowitz, Rabbi Nissim Karelitz, and Rabbi Shmuel Auerbach. Rabbi Shmuel HaLevi Wosner forbade people from starting to smoke and said that those who smoke should stop doing so. All of these rabbis also said that it is forbidden to smoke in a public place, where others might be bothered by it.\n\nAmong important Sephardi Haredi rabbis, Rabbi Ben Tzion Abba Shaul and Rabbi Moshe Tzedaka called on youth not to start smoking.\n\nOther major Ashkenazi rabbis who explicitly forbade smoking include Rabbi Eliezer Waldenberg, Rabbi Moshe Stern, and Rabbi Chaim Pinchas Sheinberg.\n\nWhile not explicitly prohibited in Hinduism, tobacco use is seen as a kind of intoxication, and as such should not be done in public. Vaishnavas of ISKCON, founded by A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhupada in 1966, are prohibited from using tobacco.\n\nCommunal smoking of a sacred pipe is a religious ceremony in a number of Native American cultures, while other tribes are social smokers only, if they smoke at all. In some cases tobacco is smoked, in other cases, \"kinnikinnick\", or a combination of the two.\n\nNaturally grown and harvested tobacco, prepared in the ways traditional to intact Native American and First Nations ceremonial communities, is very different from commercially-marketed tobacco. Commercial tobacco usually contains chemical additives and much higher levels of nicotine. In ceremonial usage, much smaller amounts of natural tobacco are burned than in secular, recreational tobacco smoking. There is a movement among Native peoples, including a resolution by The National Congress of American Indians, to make sure that only naturally-grown tobacco is used in ceremonies, and that social smoking and use of commercial tobacco be avoided or ended altogether.\n\nWHEREAS, the quality of commercial tobacco products has been compromised due to the chemical engineering by the tobacco industry and commercial tobacco contains 7,000 chemical additives (such as rat poison, formaldehyde, ammonia, acetone, arsenic and many more) that are harmful to health; and commercial tobacco disrespects the fundamental cultural traditions of American Indians and Alaska Natives; ...\nNOW THEREFORE BE IT RESOLVED, that the National Congress of American Indians does hereby endorse policies for the protection of tribal community members from tobacco use and secondhand smoke exposure through comprehensive tribal commercial tobacco-free air policies (including all forms of commercial tobacco products) in indoor workplaces and public places (including tribal casinos), providing access to high quality tobacco cessation services, and promotes the creation of policy to dis-incentivize individuals from purchasing and using commercial tobacco products; - \"National Congress of American Indians Resolution #SPO-16-046\"\n\nTobacco use holds a sacred and/or neutral view in numerous if not all pagan religions and seen in some as liberty and intoxication with the divine.\n\nGuru Gobind Singh prohibited his Sikhs from smoking tobacco. He called tobacco \"jagat jhoot\" (Punjabi: \"the world's lie\").\n\nA legend states that when Guru Gobind Singh Ji was riding his blue horse, Neela, it would not enter a tobacco field and reared up in front of it.\n\nThe idea of smoking tobacco has been looked down upon in modern Zoroastrian communities due to the scientific knowledge of it causing harm to the body. This stance on smoking does not have a direct relation to the texts of the Avestas and is not stated in the religion, rather the religion teaches to not misuse fire as it is holy. Zoroastrianism teaches to do what is best for the world based on the knowledge a person has on the topic, and indirectly the knowledge of smoking being harmful to the body causes people to condemn the act.\n\n"}

RCBR reactors represent an evolution of rotating biological contactors plants: in fact, they are able to develop about ten times the biological surface of rotating biological contactors plants, considering the same biological reactors volume (made of the set of disks). Such a result is obtained using – instead of a set of disks fixed on the central structured tree – many tridimensional plastic elements as carriers. These carriers are used to furnish the necessary biological surface for the cohesion of the bacterial film, responsible of the depuration process. These plastic elements are contained in a cilindric permeable cell, which is like the shape of the reactor cell of a traditional rotating RBC plant. One of the main peculiarity of the RCBR plant is represented by the fact that the biological carriers are common recycled water bottle plastic caps.\n\nThe intrinsic message of this technology is obvious: \"“transform a waste into a resource for the environment”\".\n\nAfter a first settling and/or screening treatment, wastewaters to be treated (civil, industrial, domestic) are pumped into RCBR modules. By the wastewaters contact, plastic caps are covered by a bacterial biological film. Bacteria are nourished by the organic substance dissolved into the water, purifying it. Purified waters can be drained on a surface body water or on the ground. If they are conveniently disinfected and complementing the modules with a tertiary depuration plant, these waters can be used to irrigate, to full the toilets, to wash objects and streets.\n\nA stainless steel cell, full of plastic caps of different dimension, slowly rotates (1–3 rpm) partially submerged inside a tank, where there are wastewaters to be purified. Plastic caps spontaneously form a bacterial film that progressively presents, at first, heterotrophic bacteria development which are able to nourish of organic carbon pollutants; then the decrease of COD and BOD concentration and then the development of autotrophic bacteria. They belong to the nitrosomonas and nitrobacter category and they are able to oxidize ammonium, transforming it into nitrites and nitrates.\nThe cell containing the carriers (caps) can be flooded as needed; in this way the depuration process control is obtained and it can be oriented both to the carbon removal both to the wastewaters denitrification. These plants, like happening for the biological disks, do not need any blower for the bacteria film oxygenation. It's the slow reactor rotation – alternatively submerged into sewage and into atmosphere – to guarantee the adequate oxygen supply for the oxidation aerobically of the sewage made by the biological film attached to the carriers. In this way it is possible to obtain a huge reduction of functioning and operating treatment costs.\n\nRCBR technology is an entirely water biological treatment system, able to make more compact and efficient the biology of any wastewaters treatment plant. For the depuration of urban wastewaters it is placed downline of primary treatments (screening, oil separation, degritting, primary settling) and upline of water physical or chemical disinfection tertiary treatments (ultraviolets, ozone). This system offers the chance to realize into restrained spaces a huge surface of cohesion for the bacteria colonies, which are active for the depuration; this aspect makes it particularly suitable also for the nitrogen removal from wastewaters, in nitro-denitro configuration. Matching a series of more modules, some of them totally submerged by the wastewaters (in anoxic conditions) operate as denitrification stadium. Others, only partially submerged into the wastewaters, in presence of oxygen, operate the carbon removal and, at the same time, the ammonium nitrification. The system simplicity and the efficiency demonstrated in the tearing down also high elevations of suspended solid and organic carbon, make it usable as a pre-treatment, upline of drinkable systems of superficial and underground polluted waters (rivers, drains, stratum, ponds and temporary puddles of rain water).\n\nThis biofilm system does not need any blower to oxygenate the bacteria colonies. It's the simple cell rotation to produce the oxygenation by simple diffusion. The energetic costs of this technology are really cheap and they are related only to the rotational movement impressed by an electric engine to the reaction cell, to maintain the device in a slow movement. The application of RCBR technology generally gets a reduction of the 90% of the water treatment electrical costs, with a medium consumption of 0.25 kWh per cubic meter of purified water.\nRCBR's low consumption makes very easy to match these plants with renewable energy, like photovoltaic or aeolian plants. RCBR devices' mechanical plant does not need any important operations of routine maintenance or any specialized technical expertise to control their operation. In fact, just the common greasing of the cell supporting rotation is requested.\n\nRCBR is an invention of Italian chemist Sergio Modenese. The first patent of the RCBR technology was registered in July 2013, by an innovative startup from Trentino Alto Adige, of whom the inventor is one of the founder partners.\n\n"}

It is the counterpart of menarche in girls. Depending on their upbringing, cultural differences, and prior sexual knowledge, boys may have different reactions to spermarche, ranging from fear to excitement. Spermarche is one of the first events in the life of a male leading to sexual maturity. It occurs at the time when the secondary sexual characteristics are just beginning to develop. The age when spermarche occurs is not easy to determine. However, researchers have tried to determine the age in various populations by taking urine samples of boys and determining the presence of spermatozoa. The presence of sperm in urine is referred to as \"spermaturia\". From various sources, it appears that spermarche occurs between 13 and 15 years of age in most cases.\n\nIn one study, boys were asked the circumstances in which their first ejaculation occurred. Most commonly this occurred via a nocturnal emission, with a significant number experiencing semenarche via masturbation. Less commonly, the first ejaculation occurred during sexual intercourse with a partner.\n\n"}
