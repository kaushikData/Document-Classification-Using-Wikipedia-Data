{"id": "11455154", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=11455154", "title": "4 Months, 3 Weeks and 2 Days", "text": "4 Months, 3 Weeks and 2 Days\n\n4 Months, 3 Weeks and 2 Days () is a 2007 Romanian art film with drama and thriller elements, written and directed by Cristian Mungiu and starring Anamaria Marinca, Laura Vasiliu, and Vlad Ivanov. The film is set in Communist Romania in the final years of the Nicolae Ceaușescu era. It tells the story of two students, roommates in a university dormitory, who try to procure an illegal abortion. Inspired by an anecdote from the period and the general social historic context, it depicts the loyalty of the two friends and the struggles they face.\n\nMungiu and cinematographer Oleg Mutu shot it in Bucharest and other Romanian locations in 2006. After making its world premiere at Cannes, \"4 Months, 3 Weeks and 2 Days\" made its Romanian debut on 1 June 2007, at the Transilvania International Film Festival. It opened to critical acclaim, and was noted for its minimalism and intense themes.\n\nThe film won three awards at the 2007 Cannes Film Festival, including the Palme d'Or. It went on to win numerous honours, including Best Film at the European Film Awards and Romania's national Gopo Awards. \"4 Months, 3 Weeks and 2 Days\" became the subject of some controversy over censorship, the abortion debate, and its exclusion from the 80th Academy Awards, but in 2016 it was named one of BBC's 100 Greatest Films of the 21st Century.\n\nIn 1987, two university students in an unnamed Romanian town, Otilia Mihartescu and Gabriela \"Găbița\" Dragut, are roommates in a dormitory. When Găbița becomes pregnant, the two young women arrange a meeting with Mr. Bebe in a hotel, where he is to perform an illegal abortion. At the college dorm, Găbița and Otilia review the items they need for the day. As Găbița nervously sits and waits, Otilia barters and buys soap and cigarettes from the dormitory shop. Afterwards, Otilia takes a bus to visit her boyfriend Adi, from whom she borrows money. Adi asks Otilia to visit his family that night, as it is his mother's birthday. Otilia initially declines, relenting after Adi becomes upset.\n\nOtilia heads to the Unirea hotel where Găbița has booked a room, only to be informed by an unfriendly receptionist that there is no reservation under Găbița's last name. Consequently, Otilia visits another hotel, the Tineretului, and after much begging and haggling, is able to book a room at an expensive rate. After speaking with Găbița on the telephone, Otilia goes to a rendezvous point to meet with Mr. Bebe, although he had asked Găbița that she meet him personally. Mr. Bebe grows angry upon hearing that Găbița is not at the planned hotel.\n\nAt the Tineretului, Mr. Bebe discovers that Găbița's claim that her pregnancy was in its second or third month was a lie, and that it has been at least four months. This changes the procedure and also adds the risk of a murder charge. While the two women were certain that they would pay no more than 3,000 lei for the abortion, it slowly becomes clear that Mr. Bebe expects both women to have sex with him. Desperate and distressed, Otilia has sex with Mr. Bebe so that he will not walk out on them, as does Găbița. Mr. Bebe then performs the abortion by injecting a probe and an unnamed fluid into Găbița's uterus, and leaves Otilia instructions on how to dispose of the fetus when it comes out. Otilia is exasperated by Găbița's lies, yet continues to help and care for her.\n\nOtilia leaves Găbița at the Tineretului to attend Adi's mother's birthday party. She is still disturbed but stays and has dinner with Adi's mother's friends, who are mostly doctors. They converse about trivial matters while Otilia and Adi remain silent. After Otilia accepts a cigarette in front of Adi's parents, one of the guests starts talking about lost values and respect for elders. Adi and Otilia retreat to his room, where she tells him about Găbița's abortion. They begin debating what would happen if it were Otilia who was pregnant, as Adi is opposed to abortion. After the argument, Otilia calls Găbița from Adi's house. Găbița does not answer, so Otilia decides to return to the hotel.\n\nWhen Otilia enters the hotel room Găbița is lying on the bed, and she tells Otilia that the fetus has been expelled and is in the bathroom. Otilia wraps the fetus with some towels and puts it in a bag, while Găbița asks her to bury it. Otilia walks outside, finally climbing to the top of a building, as Mr. Bebe had suggested, and dropping the bag in a trash chute. She returns to the Tineretului and finds Găbița sitting in its restaurant. Otilia sits and tells Găbița that they are never going to talk about the episode again. Otilia stares blankly at Găbița.\n\nRomanian Communist Party leader Nicolae Ceaușescu enacted the abortion law Decree 770 in 1966 in order to increase the population, which was falling in the 1960s and continued to fall, aside from one year after the decree's enactment. The procedure was permitted in only extremely limited circumstances. The law was not based on any religious opposition to abortion, but on the government's authority and control over its citizens. Academic Adriana Gradea further argued justifications for the decree rendered a view of women as second-class citizens, with no right to be heard. In the 1980s, the decree was strengthened to mandate gynecological appointments, to assess if individual women could reproduce. Author Dominique Nasta judged the film to be an accurate portrait of the oppression, and on the poor state of the economy of Romania in the later days of Ceaușescu's regime.\n\nDuring the years of Decree 770, the only available abortion methods, all illegal, could prove fatal to women, causing thousands of deaths. According to Mungiu's notes he shared with the press, the death toll was 500,000. Gradea cited a 10,000 estimate. Sanctions against contraception were also in place, and sex education was rare. Following the 1989 Revolution, abortion was made lawful, and subsequently unrestricted in the first 14 weeks.\n\nThe initial idea for \"4 Months, 3 Weeks and 2 Days\" was inspired by an anecdote from Communist Romania that director Cristian Mungiu had heard. Though he had heard it from a friend 15 years prior to the film, the incident occurred five years before that, in 1987, a date that Mungiu noted in the screenplay. Mungiu, himself a decrețel (born in the time of Decree 770), wanted to create a serious film focusing on the true story, which still affected him and felt tragic more than 15 years later. He conducted interviews with others who lived through the period, to determine if the experience was common. Aside from the anecdote, depicting the 1980s in Romania was appealing because he remembered the time, and \"The attraction is for the stories that I know from that period. They belong to me. They belong to my generation\". He hoped that basing the story on a factual account would also distinguish it from previous Romanian films: \nIn setting out to write the screenplay, he intended the focus to be less on the abortion, and more on the time and its people. He said, \"it's also a film about responsibilities and decision-making\". As he continued writing, he stated pushing a political point was not so much a factor in editing, as he opted not to delete potential scenes if they felt credible, asking \"Would this reasonably have happened, and does it make sense to the story to keep it?\"\n\nMungiu revised the screenplay numerous times during productions, creating 17 drafts. The major revision was the emergence of Otilia as the sole protagonist, while Găbița's part was reduced. In Mungiu's mind, Otilia had become determined to help Găbița because their shared life in the dormitory over four years would have created an emotional tie between them. The film was produced on a budget of under €600,000.\n\nCasting took place during the autumn of 2006. Because of the extended takes, Mungiu sought actors who could remember large amounts of dialogue, and found that Vlad Ivanov was ideal for a 25-minute sequence.\n\nMungiu viewed auditions of many young women for the two protagonists. Anamaria Marinca had not worked with Mungiu before reading the screenplay, and found the story intriguing. She had performed on television, but had not appeared in a film before. On initially meeting Marinca, the director could not picture her in the lead role, but was won over when she began reading the first page of the screenplay. She had experience on stage, so the lengthy takes were agreeable to her. Laura Vasiliu also had stage experience.\n\nFilming began in October 2006, with the objective to complete it by May, so that it could be entered into the 2007 Cannes Film Festival. After location scouting during the fall, most of the filming was done in Bucharest, with some scenes filmed in a hotel in Ploiești. Bucharest in 2006 was no longer how it would have appeared in 1987, due to new windows and other additions to the historic buildings. Production designer Mihaela Poenaru drew on her recollections of the period to prepare the locations. The Mr. Bebe character was also given a red Dacia car. In several scenes, the indoor locations were so small that the camera had to be placed outside of the room.\nTo highlight the emotional state of the characters, the film was shot in long takes, close-ups were avoided, and a score was not used. In Mungiu's mind, this would \"keep a proper distance from the subject and be honest with the story\". Cinematographer Oleg Mutu opted for a minimalist approach, lighting the backgrounds to display items common in 1987 while attempting not to distract from the characters too much. Mutu and Mungiu had previously developed a formula of lengthy takes and medium shots with the director's first feature film, \"Occident\". Mungiu found the dinner scene to be the most difficult to shoot, as including a large number of actors in a long take made it difficult to focus. It took 17 attempts over five days to complete the scene.\n\nIn one scene, the aborted fetus is visible on screen for approximately 14 seconds, the length it took for the actors to deliver the dialogue, with Mungiu opting not to edit out the shot since it \"was part of the story\". The chute featured at the end of the film was constructed for the film, as there was not one at the location. The crew dropped bags of cabbage and potatoes to create the sound effect.\n\nDue to Mungiu saying Romania did not use streetlights in 1987, Mutu considered other ways to light the final scenes, where the camera would move with Marinca for 200 metres. Mutu set up lights from building roofs for this sequence, employing a rod and paper lanterns for the camera.\n\nAcademic Judit Pieldner summed up the plot as \"the story of a friendship facing a moral test\". Scholar Florentina C. Andreescu opined the two female protagonists share emotional loyalty, while in the wake of Mr. Bebe's abuses, Otilia becomes increasingly suspicious of Adi.\n\nProfessor László Strausz said that the film emphasises the ways that Romania's abortion laws inflicted humiliations on the protagonists, particularly between people of differing authority and sex. He argued that class and generational conflicts are presented in the dinner party scene, where the characters have more food than lower classes, discuss social issues such as conscription into the Romanian Armed Forces, and treat Otilia as representative of the \"new generation\" that does not appreciate what it has been given. Academic Claudiu Turcuș remarked that the dinner scene, where the characters look down on some careers and act as if smoking in front of one's elders is disrespectful, shows how regressive they are. Ovidius University author Ileana Jitaru credited the film for reconstructing \"an entire communist class ideology which divided society into 'working class people' and 'intellectuals'\". Jitaru specifically cited the dinner scene, where the conversation makes much of the divide between those with university degrees and those with none. The attendees boast about belonging to the middle class, and make denigrating comments about Otilia's rural origins.\n\nThe term \"communism\" is never mentioned, the existence of Decree 770 is only implied, and dictator Nicolae Ceaușescu is never named. Despite this, communism is a major subject. Andreescu found that in many locations, one power is dominant; in some, the government, while in others, an underground power or Heterotopia forms. The hotel room where the abortion is performed becomes a location outside of the government's supervision. Mr. Bebe exploits this, boasts of the worth of his expertise and notes the risk he is taking, in order to extort the women for sex. Turcuș instead interpreted the scene as Mr. Bebe presenting himself as the \"new man\", sharing the women's legal peril and an openness to sexuality, while in fact being \"the communist brute\". \"Jump Cut\" writer Constantin Parvulescu stated \"\"4 Months, 3 Weeks and 2 Days\" provides an astute balance of ostalgia and anti-communist memorial\". Parvulescu elaborated that the beginning gives a view of place and possessions that could be nostalgic, but these become overruled by crisis in the communist society. Essayist Adriana Gradea suggested that silence is a theme of the film, and citizens of communist nations would use silence to endure and resist. This is seen at the end, where Otilia forbids further discussion of the abortion. The lack of a score can also be seen as contributing to sense of pending danger.\nThe fact that the characters live in poverty is reflected in a scene where Mr. Bebe accosts his mother for wanting to buy sugar. When Otilia is searching for Mr. Bebe, there is also a line of people visible in the background queuing for food, reflecting the lack of food security in the 1980s. Additionally, the characters are often impolite towards each other. Mungiu explained that this was related to the poverty, saying \"You need people in a society to have reached a certain standard of living before they can be polite\". The bartering scenes reflect how corporate goods common west of the Iron Curtain were prohibited in Romania and were viewed as luxuries.\n\nThe dinner scene is reminiscent of the Last Supper. Author Doru Pop acknowledged the differing number of characters and no male Jesus, but asserted that it is relevant to have a dinner while a tragedy is unfolding. Mungiu conceded that such similarities were accidental, and that once he appreciated the potential analogy during production, the filmmakers added a more focused view of Otilia to reveal her stress.\n\nScholar Dominique Nasta saw the style as a \"minimalist, 'less is more' line\". British Film Institute writer Ben Walters judged it \"simple and rigorous, with scenes composed of only one or two shots\". Walters remarked on \"handheld, mobile, almost literally breathtaking\" shots, and on the impact of still scenes. Journalist Brian Gibson assessed the photography as \"patient, alert, dogged\nin its observation of Otilia's endeavours\". Surveying the photography, academic Ileana Jitaru found \"simple, austere and realistic compositions in which the black humour is a stylistic means of anchoring the theme(s)\". Jitaru also commented on the colour scheme, observing \"cold desaturated colours\", particularly greys, blues and greens in the beginning. Additionally, the story, set during a single day, is related by real time narrative in its scenes, although minutes or hours may separate the events in separate scenes.\n\n\"The Guardian\"s Peter Bradshaw interpreted the style as \"a nightmare of social-realist suspense\". \"The Independent\" critic Jonathan Romney characterized it as \"claustrophobic\" in parts and an \"intense realist exercise\". Despite this, he also believed that the hotel scenes communicate \"a sense of almost supernatural horror\", and asks of the noise heard after Mr. Bebe chastises his mother: \"A backfire? A gunshot? Who can tell? But it lends the scene its bizarre, oppressive air of ill omen\". Critic Peter Debruge declared the style \"the antithesis of your well-lit, elegantly shot Hollywood movies — or the locally made films of Mungiu's childhood\".\n\nJournalist Steven Boone said that while the film was well reviewed for \"its bracing drabness, its ugliness, its lack of style\", he believed it was \"beautiful and stylized\", because \"it is \"alive\" and piercingly present-tense\". He compared it with the films of the Dardenne brothers. Journalist Lauren Wissot judged the story \"a suspense thriller\", comparable to the work of Alfred Hitchcock. She felt \"heat\" in each frame, writing \"we're waiting for the bomb— the constant threat of imprisonment or death that defined life under Nicolae Ceaucescu\". Aside from reflecting the length of the fictional pregnancy, the 4-3-2 form of the title creates the impression of rushed countdown reinforcing the thriller genre aspects, Gradea wrote.\n\nResponding to analogies to the Dardennes' style, Mungiu said in 2008 that he had only seen their \"La Promesse\" (1996) but was now interested in seeing more, and that he had asked the brothers to attend a showing of his film. Mungiu compared his style more to those of Miloš Forman and Jiří Menzel, though he said he was influenced more by certain films than by a director's general filmography.\n\nThe film debuted on the first day of the Cannes Film Festival in May 2007. At Cannes, IFC Films purchased distribution rights for the United States. After the festival, distribution rights for 60 countries had been sold. In September 2007, it competed at the San Sebastián International Film Festival. That month, it also screened at the 2007 Toronto International Film Festival.\n\nIn its own country, it debuted at the Transilvania International Film Festival in June 2007, where it attracted long queues. With only 50 theatres in Romania, and the lowest rates of theatre attendance in the European Union, a crew on a caravan toured 15 towns without theatres over 30 days for screenings that year. At Transylvania, Mungiu was happy to see that Romanian viewers could comprehend the dark comedy. Filmmaker Sorin Avram documented the caravan tour through Focșani, Petroșani, Călărași and other communities, and interviewed some of the audience of 17,584 people, who described it as shocking and disturbing.\n\nAlthough the film won the Cinema Prize of the French National Education System at Cannes, protests by the anti-abortion movement led French Education Minister Xavier Darcos to consider banning it from French high schools. This raised concerns among French film industry workers about censorship. Consequently, the proposed ban was dropped in July 2007, and an educational DVD using the film was made available for ages 15 and up. Television stations and an airline also wished to censor the fetus shot.\n\nIn June 2008, the film was released on DVD in Region 1 by Genius Products in the U.S. and by Mongrel Media in Canada, featuring interviews with the filmmakers and Sorin Avram's documentary \"1 Month with 4 Months, 3 Weeks, 2 Days\". In Region 2, Artificial Eye published a 2008 DVD with the interviews and Avram's documentary.\n\nIn 2007 in Romania, there were 89,000 admissions for \"4 Months, 3 Weeks and 2 Days\", making it the seventh most attended film in the country that year, and the most attended Romanian film. By 11 November 2007, it had over 300,000 admissions in France. By 8 September 2008, IFC Films reported a solid financial performance for \"4 Months, 3 Weeks and 2 Days\" in the U.S., with a gross of $1.2 million.\n\nThe film completed its run in May 2008. It made $1,198,208 in North America and $8,642,130 in other territories, for a worldwide total of $9,840,338.\n\nThe film received an enthusiastic response from critics, earning a 96% approval rating and 8.4/10 average rating on Rotten Tomatoes, based on 139 reviews, while also earning a 97% rating on Metacritic based on 37 reviews. Numerous critics also placed it in their top 10 films of 2007 or 2008. Roger Ebert awarded it four stars, commenting on the stupidity of the character Găbița and contrasting her to the title character of that year's \"Juno\", but hailing the film as \"a powerful film and a stark visual accomplishment\". \"Time\" magazine's Richard and Mary Corliss described it as a \"gripping, satisfying film\" and particularly noted the use of minimalism and \"formal rigor\" as defining aesthetic characteristics. Jay Weissberg from \"Variety\" magazine said that the film was \"pitch perfect and brilliantly acted... a stunning achievement\". He added that the film shares a number of characteristics with other productions of the New Romanian Cinema, namely: \"long takes, controlled camera and an astonishing ear for natural dialogue\". For \"The New York Times\", Manohla Dargis championed the direction, cinematography and lengthy takes.\n\nPeter Bradshaw remarked on the sharpness of Otilia and the apparent naiveté of Găbița, but considered this is how their crisis could have affected them, and praised the film as \"a masterpiece of intimate desperation\". In \"Empire\", Damon Wise gave it five stars, positively reviewing the cinematography, colour scheme, and the depiction of the black-market terror created when something is outlawed. \"The Independent\"s Jonathan Romney named it a \"masterpiece\", acknowledging the description \"Romanian abortion drama\" would be off-putting for some viewers but defending it as \"harrowing\". Writing for \"Le Monde\", Thomas Sotinel called the film excellent and cited Marinca for an intense performance. Jean-Baptiste Morain of \"Les Inrockuptibles\" remarked on the film's powerful emotions, and credited Mungiu with managing to do much with little.\n\nSome sources view the film as indicative of a broader renaissance in Romanian cinema in the 2000s, particularly in light of other successful Romanian films. These include Cristi Puiu's \"The Death of Mr. Lazarescu\", which won the \"Prix un certain regard\" at the 2005 Cannes Film Festival; Corneliu Porumboiu's \"\", which won the \"Camera d'Or\" at the 2006 Cannes Film Festival; and Cristian Nemescu's \"California Dreamin'\", which won the \"Prix un certain regard\" at the 2007 Cannes Film Festival.\nIn 2009, \"The Guardian\" ranked it seventh in its \"Best films of the noughties\" list, surveying the past decade. \"The New York Times\" critic A.O. Scott also put the film seventh on his best of the decade list. In 2015, \"The Guardian\"s Benjamin Lee identified it as his favourite film to win the \"Palme d'Or\", praising it as a success as a modern thriller. Writing in his \" 2015 Movie Guide\", Leonard Maltin rated it three and a half stars, and called it \"forceful\" with a \"matter-of-fact tone\". In a 2016 worldwide critics' poll conducted by BBC, it was ranked 15th in the 100 Greatest Films of the 21st Century.\n\nOn its international release, the film became partially viewed through the lens of the abortion debate, with Emma Wilson writing in \"Film Quarterly\" that IMDb user reviews were highlighting this and comparing it to \"Juno\". Wilson observed \"4 Months, 3 Weeks and 2 Days\" displayed the aborted fetus, comparable to the U.S. pro-life movement's use of such images, but argued the film was closer to pro-choice ideology in its focus on the law's harm to women. Wilson further argued that the true point was the loyalty of the two characters. Mungiu said the fetus shot was not linked to the pro-life movement, as Romanians did not commonly use these depictions and the abortion debate was no longer prominent there. Anti-abortion protests comparable to those in the U.S. or Ireland did not occur in Romania until 2005, when the Orthodox Church commented on the matter. Mungiu also declined to state his position on abortion, and said he attempted to keep his film and his personal position separate. Scholars Oana Godeanu-Kenworthy and Oana Popescu-Sandu argued the film was simply about communism, and the minimalism allowed for foreign audiences to see what they wanted, including a statement on the abortion debate.\n\nIn the Canadian feminist magazine \"Herizons\", reviewer Maureen Medved judged \"4 Months, 3 Weeks and 2 Days\" to approximate a horror film in depicting the abuses that women suffer when abortion is illegal. In anticipation of the 2008 U.S. presidential election, \"Time\" critics Mary and Richard Corliss also cited the film to discourage electing a candidate opposed to \"Roe v. Wade\", saying the film revealed potential negative consequences.\n\nIn \"The Australian Feminist Law Journal\", Fiona Jenkins interpreted the story as a morally ambiguous argument that safe abortion services should be allowed, but that Otilia telling Găbița they will never talk about the matter reflects her \"trauma not only of what she has undergone but what she has done\". Peter T. Chattaway, writing for \"Christianity Today\", opined that \"The abortion itself is handled in a way that could be seen to support both sides of the abortion debate\", given the abuse to women, but also the portrayal of \"the procedure's bloody aftermath\". Writer Waltraud Maierhofer also interpreted it as \"not simply for or against abortion\". Maierhofer commented a woman will consider many things in making a choice, including health, finances and what the potential child would face. In a discussion with Adi, Otilia indicates she would not be ready to enter a marriage and raise a family. Găbița's reasons are never said; it can be presumed she made the decision herself, though Maierhofer wrote at times she appears \"irresponsible\".\n\nAt the 2007 Cannes Film Festival, Cristian Mungiu became the first Romanian filmmaker to win the \"Palme d'Or\", the festival's highest honour. Later, it became the first Romanian work to receive the European Film Award for Best Film. In its home country, it was nominated for 15 Gopo Awards and won nine, including Best Film.\n\nDespite competing for the Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film, \"4 Months, 3 Weeks and 2 Days\" was not shortlisted, creating controversy among critics and online film fans, as it had won the \"Palme d'Or\". The controversy caused an Academy member to pledge nomination reform, though the category had often sparked criticism. Mungiu later said the omission and subsequent furor brought the picture substantial publicity, and that the experience taught him that critics and festival juries have differing tastes from the Academy.\n\nFollowing the Academy Award controversy, the Academy reformed its methodology of choosing Best Foreign Language Film nominees, allowing a committee of approximately 20 members to name three favourite candidates, balancing out a shortlist composed by a second committee made up of hundreds of voters. Steven Zeitchik of \"The Los Angeles Times\" remarked the nominees of 2011 reflected the change, displaying unorthodox and challenging subject matter such as youth violence (\"In a Better World\"), incest by rape (\"Incendies\") and particularly torture (\"Dogtooth\"). In 2013, \"The Wrap\" named Mungiu \"The Man Who Changed Oscar’s Rules\".\n\nMungiu reportedly planned \"4 Months, 3 Weeks and 2 Days\" to be the first in a loose series of films titled \"Tales from a Golden Age\". Mungiu explained that \"the golden age of Romania\" is a term used nationally for Ceaușescu's final nine years in power, though he said people then suffered \"shortages and hardship\". He intended to make six short films under the banner \"Tales from the Golden Age\", and then allow younger directors to take over the series. In 2009, he released a single film called \"Tales from the Golden Age\", following \"4 Months, 3 Weeks and 2 Days\" in depicting the Ceaușescu era and starring Vlad Ivanov. His next film, \"Beyond the Hills\" (2012), similarly depicted Romanian extremism, and Mungiu was inspired to make the cinematic adaptation after seeing the stage version in New York while promoting \"4 Months, 3 Weeks and 2 Days\".\n\n\n"}

{"id": "39904616", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=39904616", "title": "Abortion in Lithuania", "text": "Abortion in Lithuania\n\nAbortion in Lithuania is legal and available on request until the twelfth week of pregnancy, and up to 22 weeks for medical reasons. While Lithuania was a Republic of the Soviet Union (as the Lithuanian Soviet Socialist Republic), abortions were regulated by the Government of the Soviet Union.\n\nAfter becoming the Lithuanian Soviet Socialist Republic on 21 July 1940, Lithuania followed the abortions laws of the Soviet Union. On 27 June 1936, the USSR banned abortions unless there was a danger to the life of the mother or the child would inherit a serious disease from the parents. Under this law abortions were meant to be performed in maternity homes and hospitals, and physicians who disregarded this risked one to two years' imprisonment.\n\nOn 23 November 1955, the Soviet Union issued a decree which allowed abortions to be available on request. Later that year abortion was restricted so that it could only be performed in the first three months of pregnancy unless the birth would endanger the mother. Physicians had to perform abortions in hospitals and, unless the mother was in danger, a fee was charged. If the abortion was not performed in a hospital, the physician could be imprisoned for one year, while a person not in possession of a medical degree could be imprisoned for two years. The serious injury or death of a pregnant woman could result in the sentence being extended up to eight years.\n\nThe Government of the USSR was concerned about the rate of illegal abortions and attempted to decrease their occurrence. On 31 December 1987, the Soviet Union announced that it would allow many medical institutions to perform abortions until the twenty-eighth week of pregnancy. In 1989, there were 50,100 abortions and 55,782 live births in Lithuania. By 2010, the number of abortions decreased to 6,989 abortions and 35,626 live births. , the abortion rate was 9.8 abortions per 1000 women aged 15-44 years.\n\nFrom 1995 to 2000, the total fertility rate in Lithuania was 1.4 children/per woman, which the government officially wants to increase. Lithuania's low fertility rate, and its Catholic traditions make abortion a controversial political issue, and regular attempts to restrict it occur. There have been several attempts in recent years to adopt a more restrictive law on abortion, especially after 2005. Such attempts are particularly associated with the Polish minority.\n"}

The name Christian syndrome derives from Joe. C. Christian, the first person to describe the condition. Inheritance is believed to be autosomal recessive, caused by mutation in the CHST14 (carbohydrate sulfotransferase 14) gene.\n\nThis syndrome is characterised by typical facial appearance, slight build, thin and translucent skin, severely adducted thumbs, arachnodactyly, club feet, joint instability, facial clefting and bleeding disorders, as well as heart, kidney or intestinal defects. Severe psychomotor and developmental delay and decreased muscle tone may also be present during infancy. Cognitive development during childhood is normal.\n\nThis syndrome is associated with microcephaly, arthrogryposis and cleft palate and various craniofacial, respiratory, neurological and limb abnormalities, including bone and joint defects of the upper limbs, adducted thumbs, camptodactyly and talipes equinovarus or calcaneovalgus. It is characterized by craniosynostosis, and myopathy in association with congenital generalized hypertrichosis.\nPatients with the disease are considered intellectually disabled. Most die in childhood. Patients often suffer from respiratory difficulties such as pneumonia, and from seizures due to dysmyelination in the brain's white matter. It has been hypothesized that the Moro reflex (startle reflex in infants) may be a tool in detecting the congenital clapsed thumb early in infancy. The thumb normally extends as a result of this reflex.\n\n\n"}

Autistic pride recognises the importance of pride for autistics and its role in bringing about positive changes in the broader society.\n\nOn June 18 every year, organisations around the world celebrate Autistic Pride Day, with events around the world, to connect with one another through autistic events and demonstrate to allistics (people not on the autism spectrum) that autistic people are unique individuals who should not be seen as cases for treatment.\n\nAutistic Pride Day was first celebrated in 2005 by Aspies for Freedom and it quickly became a global event which is celebrated widely online and offline. AFF modelled the celebration on the gay pride movement. According to Kabie Brook, the co-founder of Autism Rights Group Highland (ARGH), \"the most important thing to note about the day is that it is an autistic community event: it originated from and is still led by autistic people ourselves\", i.e. it is not a day for other charities or organisations to promote themselves or stifle autistic people. The rainbow infinity symbol is used as the symbol of this day, representing \"diversity with infinite variations and infinite possibilities\".\n\nDuring gay pride and other events, a rainbow flag is used featuring a white infinity symbol on a tri-colour background or a rainbow infinity symbol against a white or black background. (In Canada, only the rainbow infinity is used, because the white infinity symbol is in use on the Metis flag) LGBT+ autistic charity Twainbow oversaw the selection and online voting in 2015.\n\nAutistic pride points out that autistic people have always been an important part of human culture. Being autistic is a form of neurodiversity. As with all forms of neurodiversity, most of the challenges autistic people face come from other people's attitudes about autism and a lack of supports and accommodations (ableism), rather than being essential to the autistic condition. For instance, according to Gareth Nelson, many autism- related organizations promote feelings of pity for parents, rather than fostering understanding Autistic activists have contributed to a shift in attitudes away from the notion that autism is a deviation from the norm that must be treated or cured. Autistic self-advocacy organizations, which are led and run by autistics, are a key force in the movement for autistic acceptance and autistic pride. \"New Scientist\" magazine released an article entitled \"Autistic and proud\" on the first Autistic Pride Day that discussed the idea.\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "1368247", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1368247", "title": "CADASIL", "text": "CADASIL\n\nCADASIL or CADASIL syndrome, involving cerebral autosomal dominant arteriopathy with subcortical infarcts and leukoencephalopathy, is the most common form of hereditary stroke disorder, and is thought to be caused by mutations of the \"Notch 3\" gene on chromosome 19. The disease belongs to a family of disorders called the leukodystrophies. The most common clinical manifestations are migraine headaches and transient ischemic attacks or strokes, which usually occur between 40 and 50 years of age, although MRI is able to detect signs of the disease years prior to clinical manifestation of disease.\n\nThe condition was identified and named by French researchers Marie-Germaine Bousser and Elisabeth Tournier-Lasserve, in the 1990s.\n\nCADASIL may start with attacks of migraine with aura or subcortical transient ischemic attacks or strokes, or mood disorders between 35 and 55 years of age. The disease progresses to subcortical dementia associated with pseudobulbar palsy and urinary incontinence.\n\nIschemic strokes are the most frequent presentation of CADASIL, with approximately 85% of symptomatic individuals developing transient ischemic attacks or stroke(s). The mean age of onset of ischemic episodes is approximately 46 years (range 30–70). A classic lacunar syndrome occurs in at least two-thirds of affected patients while hemispheric strokes are much less common. It is worthy of note that ischemic strokes typically occur in the absence of traditional cardiovascular risk factors. Recurrent silent strokes, with or without clinical strokes, often lead to cognitive decline and overt subcortical dementia. A case of CADASIL presenting as schizophreniform organic psychosis has been reported.\n\nThe underlying pathology of CADASIL is progressive degeneration of the smooth muscle cells in blood vessels. Autosomal dominant mutations in the \"Notch 3\" gene (on the long arm of chromosome 19) cause an abnormal accumulation of Notch 3 at the cytoplasmic membrane of vascular smooth muscle cells both in cerebral and extracerebral vessels, seen as granular osmiophilic deposits on electron microscopy. Leukoencephalopathy follows. Depending on the nature and position of each mutation, a consensus significant loss of betasheet structure of the Notch3 protein has been predicted using in silico analysis.\n\nMRIs show hypointensities on T1-weighted images and hyperintensities on T2-weighted images, usually multiple confluent white matter lesions of various sizes, are characteristic. These lesions are concentrated around the basal ganglia, peri-ventricular white matter, and the pons, and are similar to those seen in Binswanger disease. These white matter lesions are also seen in asymptomatic individuals with the mutated gene. While MRI is not used to diagnose CADASIL, it can show the progression of white matter changes even decades before onset of symptoms.\n\nThe definitive test is sequencing the whole Notch 3 gene, which can be done from a sample of blood. However, as this is quite expensive and CADASIL is a systemic arteriopathy, evidence of the mutation can be found in small and medium-size arteries. Therefore, skin biopsies are often used for the diagnosis.\n\nNo specific treatment for CADASIL is available. While most treatments for CADASIL patients' symptoms – including migraine and stroke – are similar to those without CADASIL, these treatments are almost exclusively empiric, as data regarding their benefit to CADASIL patients is limited. Antiplatelet agents such as aspirin, dipyridamole, or clopidogrel might help prevent strokes; however, anticoagulation may be inadvisable given the propensity for microhemorrhages. Control of high blood pressure is particularly important in CADASIL patients. Short-term use of atorvastatin, a statin-type cholesterol-lowering medication, has not been shown to be beneficial in CADASIL patients' cerebral hemodynamic parameters, although treatment of comorbidities such as high cholesterol is recommended. Stopping oral contraceptive pills may be recommended. Some authors advise against the use of triptan medications for migraine treatment, given their vasoconstrictive effects, although this sentiment is not universal. As with other individuals, people with CADASIL should be encouraged to quit smoking.\n\nIn one small study, around 1/3 of patients with CADASIL were found to have cerebral microhemorrhages (tiny areas of old blood) on MRI.\n\nL-arginine, a naturally occurring amino acid, has been proposed as a potential therapy for CADASIL, but as of 2017 there are no clinical studies supporting its use. Donepezil, normally used for Alzheimer's Disease, was not shown not to improve executive functioning in CADASIL patients.\n\nThough there are few clinical trials currently (2018) ongoing, there are natural history studies that patients can join. Studies can be found at www.clinicaltrials.gov. The CADASIL Disease Discovery Study (NCT02821780) was the first prospective study in the US, sponsored by the National Institute of Health National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI) starting in 2016 and led by principal investigator Manfred Boehm.\n\nJohn Ruskin has been suggested to have suffered from CADASIL. Ruskin reported in his diaries having visual disturbances consistent with the disease, and it has also been suggested that it might have been a factor in causing him to describe James Whistler's \"Nocturne in Black and Gold – The Falling Rocket\" as \"ask[ing] two hundred guineas for throwing a pot of paint in the public's face\". This resulted in the famous libel trial that resulted in a jury's awarding Whistler one farthing damages.\n\nRecent research into the illness of philosopher Friedrich Nietzsche has suggested that his mental illness and death may have been caused by CADASIL rather than tertiary syphilis. Likewise, the early death of the composer Felix Mendelssohn, at age 37, from a stroke has been potentially linked to CADASIL. His sister, Fanny Mendelssohn, was similarly affected.\n\nThe character Julia, in the 2004 Spanish film \"The Sea Inside\", has the condition.\n\nRock bassist and vocalist James Dewar was posthumously identified as having died of the condition.\n\n\n"}

The task force was created in January 1993, but its own processes were somewhat controversial and drew litigation. Its goal was to come up with a comprehensive plan to provide universal health care for all Americans, which was to be a cornerstone of the administration's first-term agenda. The president delivered a major health care speech to the US Congress in September 1993. During his speech he proposed an enforced mandate for employers to provide health insurance coverage to all of their employees.\n\nOpposition to the plan was heavy from conservatives, libertarians, and the health insurance industry. The industry produced a highly effective television ad, \"Harry and Louise\", in an effort to rally public support against the plan.\n\nInstead of uniting behind the original proposal, many Democrats offered a number of competing plans of their own. Hillary Clinton was drafted by the Clinton Administration to head a new Task Force and sell the plan to the American people, which ultimately backfired amid the barrage from the pharmaceutical and health insurance industries and considerably diminished her own popularity. On September 26, 1994, the final compromise Democratic bill was declared dead by Senate Majority Leader George J. Mitchell.\n\nAccording to an address to Congress by then-President Bill Clinton on September 22, 1993, the proposed bill would provide a \"health care security card\" to every citizen that would irrevocably entitle him or her to medical treatment and preventative services, including for pre-existing conditions.\n\nTo achieve this, the Clinton health plan required each US citizen and permanent resident alien to become enrolled in a qualified health plan on his or her own or through programs mandated to be offered by businesses with more than 5,000 full-time employees. Subsidies were to be provided to those too poor to afford coverage, including complete subsidies for those below a set income level. Users would choose plans offered by regional health alliances to be established by each state. These alliances would purchase insurance coverage for the state's residents and could set fees for doctors who charge per procedure. The act provided funding to be sent to the states for the administration of the plan, beginning at $14 billion in 1993 and reaching $38 billion in 2003.\n\nThe plan also specified which benefits must be offered; a National Health Board to oversee the quality of health care services; enhanced physician training; the creation of model information systems; federal funding in the case of the insolvency of state programs; rural health programs; long-term care programs; coverage for abortions, with a \"conscience clause\" to exempt practitioners with religious objections; malpractice and antitrust reform; fraud prevention measures; and a prescription drug benefit for Medicare, among other features.\n\nOnce in office, Bill Clinton quickly set up the Task Force on National Health Care Reform, headed by First Lady Hillary Clinton, to come up with a comprehensive plan to provide universal health care for all Americans, which was to be a cornerstone of the administration's first-term agenda. He delivered a major health care speech to a joint session of Congress on September 22, 1993. In that speech, he explained the problem:\n\nHer leading role in the project was unprecedented for a presidential spouse. This unusual decision by the president to put his wife in charge of the project has been attributed to several factors, such as his desire to emphasize his personal commitment to the enterprise.\n\nStarting on September 28, 1993, Hillary Clinton appeared for several days of testimony before five congressional committees on health care. Opponents of the bill organized against it before it was presented to the Democratic-controlled Congress on November 20, 1993. The bill was a complex proposal of more than 1000 pages, the core element of which was an enforced mandate for employers to provide health insurance coverage to all of their employees. The full text of the November 20 bill (the Health Security Act) is available online.\n\nProminent opposition to the Clinton plan was led by William Kristol and his policy group Project for the Republican Future, which is widely credited with orchestrating the plan's defeat through a series of now legendary \"policy memos\" faxed to Republican leaders.\n\nConservatives, libertarians, and the health insurance industry proceeded to campaign against the plan, criticizing it as being overly bureaucratic and restrictive of patient choice:\nThe conservative Heritage Foundation argued that \"the Clinton Administration is imposing a top-down, command-and-control system of global budgets and premium caps, a superintending National Health Board and a vast system of government sponsored regional alliances, along with a panoply of advisory boards, panels, and councils, interlaced with the expanded operations of the agencies of Department of Health and Human Services and the Department of Labor, issuing innumerable rules, regulations, guidelines, and standards.\"\n\nThe effort also included extensive advertising criticizing the plan, including the famous \"Harry and Louise\" ad, paid for by the Health Insurance Association of America, which depicted a middle-class couple despairing over the plan's complex, bureaucratic nature. \"Time\", \"CBS News\", \"CNN\", \"The Wall Street Journal\" and the \"Christian Science Monitor\" ran stories questioning whether there really was a health care crisis. Op-eds were written against it, including one in \"The Washington Post\" by conservative University of Virginia Professor Martha Derthick that said,\n\nMeanwhile, instead of uniting behind the President's original proposal, other Democrats offered a number of competing plans of their own. Some criticized the plan from the left, preferring a single-payer healthcare system. \n\nThe First Lady's role in the secret proceedings of the Health Care Task Force also sparked litigation in the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit in relation to the Federal Advisory Committee Act (FACA), which requires openness in government. The Clinton White House argued that the in Article II of the US Constitution would make it unconstitutional to apply the procedural requirements of FACA to her participation in the meetings of the Task Force. Some constitutional experts argued to the court that such a legal theory was not supported by the text, the history, or the structure of the Constitution. Ultimately, Hillary Clinton won the litigation in June 1993, when the D.C. Circuit ruled narrowly that the First Lady could be deemed a government official (and not a mere private citizen) for the purpose of not having to comply with the procedural requirements of FACA.\n\nAlso in February 1993, the Association of American Physicians and Surgeons, along with several other groups, filed a lawsuit against Hillary Clinton and Donna Shalala over closed-door meetings related to the health care plan. The AAPS sued to gain access to the list of members of the task force. In 1997, Judge Royce C. Lamberth found in favor of the plaintiffs and awarded $285,864 to the AAPS for legal costs; Lamberth also harshly criticized the Clinton administration and Clinton aide Ira Magaziner in his ruling. Subsequently, a federal appeals court overturned in 1999 the award and the initial findings on the basis that Magaziner and the administration had not acted in bad faith.\n\nIn August 1994, Democratic Senate Majority Leader George J. Mitchell introduced a compromise proposal that would have delayed requirements of employers until 2002 and exempted small businesses. However, \"even with Mitchell’s bill, there were not enough Democratic Senators behind a single proposal to pass a bill, let alone stop a filibuster.\"\n\nA few weeks later, Mitchell announced that his compromise plan was dead and that health care reform would have to wait at least until the next Congress. The defeat weakened Clinton politically, emboldened Republicans, and contributed to the notion that she was a \"big-government liberal\" as decried by conservative opponents.\n\nThe 1994 mid-term election became, in the opinion of one media observer, a \"referendum on big government – Hillary Clinton had launched a massive health-care reform plan that wound up strangled by its own red tape.\" In that 1994 election, the Republican revolution, led by Newt Gingrich, gave the GOP control of both the House of Representatives and the Senate for the first time since the 83rd Congress of 1953–1954, ending prospects for a Clinton-sponsored health care overhaul.\n\nComprehensive health care reform in the United States was not seriously considered or enacted by Congress until Barack Obama's election in 2008.\n\nIn 1997, the Clinton administration supported an experimental program in New York that paid medical schools to train fewer doctors to reduce a \"glut of physicians.\"\n\nIn 2004, as a US senator from New York, Hillary Clinton argued in \"The New York Times\" that the current health care system is unsustainable, and she offered several solutions. Her article also mentioned areas of agreement with onetime opponent Newt Gingrich, and likewise, Gingrich has expressed agreement with Clinton on some aspects of health care, including a bill to modernize medical record keeping.\n\nIn 2005, referring to her previous efforts at health care reform, she said, \"I learned some valuable lessons about the legislative process, the importance of bipartisan cooperation and the wisdom of taking small steps to get a big job done.\" Again in 2007, she reflected on her role in 1993–1994: \"I think that both the process and the plan were flawed. We were trying to do something that was very hard to do, and we made a lot of mistakes.\"\n\nShe received hundreds of thousands of dollars in campaign contributions from doctors, hospitals, drug companies, and insurance companies for her 2006 re-election in the Senate, including several insurance companies that were members of the Health Insurance Association of America that helped defeat the Clinton Health Plan in 1994. Charles N. Kahn III, a Republican who was executive vice president of the Health Insurance Association in 1993 and 1994, refers to his previous battles with Clinton as \"ancient history,\" and says \"she is extremely knowledgeable about health care and has become a Congressional leader on the issue.\"\n\nUntil the Affordable Healthcare for America Act, a combination of factors kept health care off the top of the agenda. For example, politicians were not eager to confront the forces that successfully frustrated the Clinton effort, health maintenance organizations were able to limit cost increases to some extent, and a conservative Republican majority in Congress or a conservative Republican president was in power or in office.\n\nThe Clinton health care plan remains the most prominent national proposal associated with Hillary Clinton and may have influenced her prospects in the 2008 presidential election. There are some similarities between Clinton's plan and Republican Mitt Romney's health care plan, which has been implemented in Massachusetts, though Romney has since distanced himself from Clinton on the issue, in particular arguing that his plan calls for more control at the state level and the private market, not from the federal government.\n\nIn September 2007, former Clinton Administration senior health policy advisor Paul Starr published an article, \"The Hillarycare Mythology,\" and he wrote that Bill, not Hillary, Clinton, was the driving force behind the plan at all stages of its origination and development; the task force headed by her quickly became useless and was not the primary force behind formulating the proposed policy; and \"[n]ot only did the fiction of Hillary's personal responsibility for the health plan fail to protect the president at the time, it has also now come back to haunt her in her own quest for the presidency.\"\n\n\n"}
{"id": "234185", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=234185", "title": "Compartment syndrome", "text": "Compartment syndrome\n\nCompartment syndrome is a condition in which increased pressure within one of the body's compartments results in insufficient blood supply to tissue within that space. There are two main types: acute and chronic. The leg or arm is most commonly involved.\nSymptoms of acute compartment syndrome can include severe pain, poor pulses, decreased ability to move, numbness, or a pale color of the affected limb. It is most commonly due to physical trauma such as a bone fracture or crush injury. It can also occur after blood flow returns following a period of poor blood flow. Diagnosis is generally based upon a person's symptoms. Treatment is by surgery to open the compartment completed in a timely manner. If not treated within six hours, permanent muscle or nerve damage can result.\nIn chronic compartment syndrome, there is generally pain with exercise. Other symptoms may include numbness. Symptoms typically resolve with rest. Common activities that trigger it include running and biking. It does not generally result in permanent damage. Other conditions that may present similarly include stress fractures and tendinitis. Treatment may include physical therapy or—if that is not effective—surgery.\nAcute compartment syndrome occurs in about 3% of those who have a midshaft fracture of the forearm. Rates in other areas and for chronic cases are unknown. The condition more often occurs in those under the age of 35 and in males. Compartment syndrome was first described in 1881 by Richard von Volkmann. Untreated, acute compartment syndrome can result in Volkmann's contracture.\n\nAcute compartment syndrome (ACS) can develop after a severe crush injury and rarely after a relatively minor injury. The legs and the forearms are the most frequent sites affected by compartment syndrome. Other areas of the body such as thigh, buttock, hand, and foot can also be affected.\n\nThere are five characteristic signs and symptoms related to acute compartment syndrome: pain, paraesthesia (reduced sensation), paralysis, pallor, and pulselessness. Pain and paresthesia are the early symptoms of compartment syndrome.\n\n\nThe limb with compartment syndrome is often associated with a firm, wooden feeling on deep palpation.\n\nThe symptoms of chronic exertional compartment syndrome (CECS) are brought on by exercise and consist of a sensation of extreme tightness in the affected muscles followed by a painful burning sensation if exercise is continued. After exercise is ceased, the pressure in the compartment will decrease within a few minutes, relieving painful symptoms. Symptoms will occur at a certain threshold of exercise which varies from person to person but is rather consistent for a given individual and can range anywhere from 30 seconds of running to about 10–15 minutes of running. CECS most commonly occurs in the lower leg, with the anterior compartment being the most frequently affected compartment. Foot drop is a common symptom of CECS.\n\nFailure to relieve the pressure can result in necrosis of tissue in that compartment, since capillary perfusion will fall leading to increasing oxygen deprivation of those tissues. This can cause Volkmann's contracture in affected limbs. As intercompartmental pressure rises during compartment syndrome, perfusion within the compartment is reduced leading to ischemia, which if left untreated, results in necrosis of nerves and muscles of the compartment (Shears, 2006). Rhabdomyolysis and subsequent renal failure are also possible complications.\n\nThe most common cause of acute compartment syndrome (ACS) are fractures, which account for 69% to 75% of the cases. Leg compartment syndrome is found in 2 to 9% of the tibial fractures. There is no difference in incidences of compartment syndrome between open and closed fractures. Rhabdomyolysis is associated with 23% of the cases. In this case, inflammation and soft tissue swellings would determine the rise of intra-compartmental pressure. Injury to blood vessels such as popliteal artery have a high incidence of compartment syndrome by reducing blood supply to soft tissues. Such reduction in blood supply can cause a series of inflammatory reactions that promote the swelling of the soft tissues. Such inflammation can be further worsened by reperfusion therapy. Because the fascia layer that defines the compartment of the limbs does not stretch, a small amount of bleeding into the compartment, or swelling of the muscles within the compartment, can cause the pressure to rise greatly. Other causes such as intravenous drug injection, casts, prolonged limb compression, crush injuries and eschars from burns can also cause compartment syndrome. Rare causes of compartment syndrome are: gluteal compartment syndrome due to injury to superior gluteal artery, and those with anticoagulant therapy has increase risk of bleeding into a closed compartment.\n\nAbdominal compartment syndrome occurs when the intra-abdominal pressure exceeds 20 mmHg and abdominal perfusion pressure is less than 60 mmHg, associated with organ dysfunction and organ failures. There are three causes of abdominal compartment syndrome: primary (haemorrhage and organ odema), secondary (vigorous fluid replacement which causes formation of ascites and rise in intra-abdominal pressure), and recurrent (compartment syndrome recurred after the treatment of secondary compartment syndrome).\n\nWhen compartment syndrome is caused by repetitive use of the muscles, it is known as chronic compartment syndrome (CCS). This is usually not an emergency, but the loss of circulation can cause temporary or permanent damage to nearby nerves and muscles.\n\nComplementary to chronic compartment syndrome is another subset known as chronic exertional compartment syndrome CECS, often called exercise induced compartment syndrome EICS. CECS of the leg is a condition caused by exercise which results in increased tissue pressure within a limited fibro-osseous compartment – muscle size may increase by up to 20% during exercise. When this happens, pressure builds up in the tissues and muscles causing tissue ischemia. An increase in muscle weight will reduce the compartment volume of the surrounding fascial borders and result in an increase of intracompartmental pressure. An increase in the pressure of the tissue can cause fluid to exude into the small spaces between the tissue known as interstitial space, leading to a disruption of the micro-circulation of the leg. This condition occurs commonly in the lower leg and various other locations within the body, such as the foot or forearm. This is commonly seen in athletes who train rigorously in activities that involve constant repetitive actions or motions. In athletic popular culture there is a catchphrase, \"Feel the burn,\" which references these conditions as something to strive for when training, weightlifting or otherwise working out. They are not understood as symptoms. The symptoms involve numbness or a tingling sensation in the area most affected. Other signs and symptoms include pain described as aching, tightening, cramping, sharp, or stabbing. This pain can occur for months, and in some cases over a period of years, and may be relieved by rest. It also includes moderate weakness that can be a noticeable factor in the affected region. Chronic exertional compartment syndrome most commonly affects the anterior compartment of the leg, this can lead to problems with dorsiflexion of the ankle and the toes. The symptoms of CECS are often confused with more common injuries like shin splints and spinal stenosis. Treatment for chronic exertional compartment syndrome includes decreasing or subsiding exercising and activities, or cross training for athletes. In cases with severe intracompartmental pressures surgical treatment, a fasciotomy, is necessary.\n\nIn a normal human body, blood flow from the artery to vein requires a pressure gradient. When this pressure gradient is diminished, blood flow from the artery to the vein is reduced. This causes excessive fluid to go out from the capillary wall into spaces between the soft tissues cells, causing oedema and rise in intra-compartmental pressure. Swelling of the soft tissues compresses the blood and lymphatic vessels further, causing more fluid to enter the intercellular spaces, leading to more compression, eventually leading to lack of oxygen in the soft tissues (tissue ischaemia) and tissue death (necrosis). Tingling and abnormal sensation (paraesthesia) can begin as early as 30 minutes from the start of tissue ischemia and permanent damage can occur as early as 12 hours post onset.\n\nCompartment syndrome is a clinical diagnosis. Apart from the typical signs and symptoms, measurement of intra-compartmental pressure is also important for diagnosis. A transducer connected to a catheter is inserted 5 cm into the zone of injury. A pressure higher than 30 mmHg of the diastolic pressure in conscious or unconscious person is associated with compartment syndrome; and fasciotomy is indicated. For those with hypotension, a pressure of 20 mmHg higher than the intra-compartmental pressure is associated with compartmental syndrome.\n\nMost commonly compartment syndrome is diagnosed through a diagnosis of its underlying cause and not the condition itself. According to Blackman one of the tools to diagnose compartment syndrome is X-ray to show a tibia/fibula fracture, which when combined with numbness of the extremities is enough to confirm the presence of compartment syndrome.\n\nAny orthopedic casts or dressing applied on the affected limb should be removed. Cutting of cast will reduce the intra-compartmental pressure by 65%, followed by 10 to 20% pressure reduction once padding is cut. After the cast removal, the limb should be placed at the heart level for adequate perfusion. The vital signs of the patient should be closely monitored. If the clinical condition does not improve, then fasciotomy is indicated to decompress the compartments. An incision large enough to decompress all the compartments is necessary. Such procedure is performed inside an operating theatre under general or local anaesthesia. However, the timing of wound closure is still debatable. Wound edges need to be debrided and irrigated before closure. Usually, wound closure would be done seven days after fasciotomy.\n\nChronic compartment syndrome in the lower leg can be treated conservatively or surgically. Conservative treatment includes rest, anti-inflammatories, and manual decompression. Elevation of the affected limb in patients with compartment syndrome is contraindicated, as this leads to decreased vascular perfusion of the affected region. Ideally, the affected limb should be positioned at the level of the heart. The use of devices that apply external pressure to the area, such as splints, casts, and tight wound dressings, should be avoided. If symptoms persist after conservative treatment or if an individual does not wish to cease engaging in the physical activities which bring on symptoms, compartment syndrome can be treated by a surgery known as a fasciotomy. Surgery is the most effective treatment for compartment syndrome. Incisions are made in the affected muscle compartments so that they will decompress. This decompression will relieve the pressure on the venules and lymphatic vessels, and will increase bloodflow throughout the muscle. Left untreated, chronic compartment syndrome can develop into the acute syndrome and lead to permanent muscle and nerve damage.\n\nA military study conducted in 2012 found that teaching individuals with lower leg chronic exertional compartment syndrome to change their running stride to a forefoot running technique abated symptoms. Follow up studies are needed to confirm the finding of this study.\n\nHyperbaric oxygen therapy has been suggested by case reports – though as of 2011 not proven in controlled randomized trials – to be an effective adjunctive therapy for crush injury, compartment syndrome, and other acute traumatic ischemias, by improving wound healing and reducing the need for repetitive surgery.\n\nA mortality rate of 47% has been reported for acute compartment syndrome of the thigh. According to one study the rate of fasciotomy varied from 2% to 24%.\n\nThe annual incidence of acute compartment syndrome is 1 to 7.3 per 100,000. Men are ten times more likely than women to develop ACS. Mean age for ACS in men is 30 years. Meanwhile for women, the mean age is 44 years.\n\n\n"}

There are direct-entry midwifery programs that prepare students to become Certified Nurse Midwives (CNMs) or Certified Professional Midwives (CPMs). Certified Professional Midwives are known for being \"more natural and less intervention oriented.\" In other words, these midwives typically work outside of the hospital setting in homes and birth centers and do not employ methods for childbirth that physicians in hospitals commonly use such as caesarean section, forceps and other types of equipment and drugs.\n\nWhile direct-entry midwifery is popular and legal in many cultures around the world, it struggles to gain legality in several states in the U.S. Nurse-midwives can practice legally in all 50 states however, Certified Professional Midwives are regulated and licensed in 23 states.\n\n23 states don’t regulate Certified Professional Midwives or provide an avenue for licensure. Penalties for practicing as a midwife without a CNM credential range from a misdemeanor to a Class C Felony. These states include Alabama, Connecticut, the District of Columbia, Georgia, Illinois, Iowa, Kansas, Kentucky, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, Mississippi, Nebraska, Nevada, North Carolina, North Dakota, Ohio, Oklahoma, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, South Dakota and West Virginia.\n\nNorth Dakota, for instance, is one of many states that have no official laws regulating or prohibiting the practice of midwives without a CNM credential. States can unintentionally encourage issues with midwifery by not providing standards or licensure opportunities to ensure the competency of midwives.\n\nAlso, practicing midwifery without having a CNM credential in these states is basically equivalent to practicing medicine without a license and has severe penalties.\n\nSome states, while they regulate the profession, make it very difficult for midwives to obtain licenses to perform. Hawaii is one of these states. While Certified Professional Midwifery is legal in Hawaii, licensure has been deemed too expensive and is unavailable to most, according to the Midwives Alliance of North America. Delaware is another state that, while it regulates the profession, sets up obstacles that make it difficult for CPMs to practice in the state. Theoretically, Delaware CPMs are able to obtain a permit to practice, but one hasn’t been issued since 2007.\n\nThe decline of midwifery in the United States can be contributed to a number of complex factors: the rise of the American Medical Association and the growth of hospitals in the country in the late 1800s and early 1900s shifted births from the home to the hospital.\nThe fall can also be attributed to the movement toward universities teaching gynecology and surgery as well as advancements in technology such as anesthesia and forceps. All of this led physicians to see midwives as competition instead of partners. They were also worried about what people would think about doctors if it appeared that anyone so uneducated could perform the work of a medical professional.\nDuring this time period, organized medicine launched a campaign to convince the public that hospital births were the best option, while painting midwives as unintelligent, untrustworthy and criminal. However, it wasn’t just physicians who joined in the campaign against midwifery – by the late nineteenth century, wealthy, pregnant women joined in because they though childbirth was less painful and safer if performed by physicians\n\nStatistics show that American women want alternatives to hospital births. 20 percent of women indicated in a study in 2006 that if they have the option to have a non-hospital delivery with readily available medical backup, they would take it.\nThe State of the World’s Midwifery report supports the profession, urging governments to recognize it as vital to maternal and newborn health services. It also urges governments to consider establishing a scope of practice, specified credentials for entering the profession and educational standards.\nThose who argue for the legalization of direct-entry midwifery also cite its health benefits, both to the mother and the fetus.\nWomen who give birth in hospitals experience higher risks and adverse effects than women who give birth with a midwife. Studies also show that the use of midwives in childbirth can decrease maternal and newborn mortality as well as stillbirths, perineal trauma, instrumental births, intrapartum analgesia and anesthesia, severe blood loss, preterm births, newborn infants with low birth weigh, hypothermia and neonatal intensive care units.\n\nThere are also indications that midwife assisted childbirth is safer than birth in a hospital because there’s a lower chance of intervention.\n\nThose debating against the legalization of certified professional midwives usually question the competence, regulation and scope of midwives. Questions regarding whether CPMs should be legally recognized as birth attendants, what their job should allow them to do, and who is responsible for their regulation surface. Health care professional also cite recent studies that have shown that hospital births have lower rates of perinatal death, neonatal death, 5-minute Apgar scores < 4, and neonatal seizures when compared to planned out-of-hospital births, including those with a midwife. Also of note, while hospital births are associated with higher rates of intervention such as forceps, labor induction, labor augmentation, and cesarean delivery, the data is skewed, as midwives do not have the necessary training to use the aforementioned techniques when deemed medically necessary.\n\nMany CPMs also support regulation and licensure because they believe limitations on a legalized profession would outweigh having to operation under the threat of prosecution in states where the profession is illegal. For instance, to qualify for licensure in California, a midwife must complete a three-year postsecondary midwifery education program and pass a licensing examination.\nIn Minnesota, licensed midwives are required to screen potential clients, and only accept those who are expected to have a “normal” delivery. In 1994, the North American Registry of Midwives (NARM) formed, as it recognized a need for direct-entry midwives to obtain national certification. State regulation of direct-entry midwifery was varied, and the professional associated realized the professional needed certification standards. As of 1994, direct-entry midwives can receive certification through NARM and be designed as certified professional midwives (CPMs). Now, for states that regulate the profession, most of them require midwifery candidates to take the NARM exam and complete NARM certification before receiving a license from the state, however certification and licensure is only recognized in states that legalize and recognize midwifery.” In order to be recognized as a CPM by NARM, a midwife must meet three criteria: meet all education requirements and pass a certification exam; meet minimum experience requirements; document proficiency in all midwifery skills (Stover, 2011, p. 325). This can take anywhere between three and five years. This certification also must be renewed every three years.\n"}

The appropriate method of dealing with diseased hog carcasses is disposal by burial or burning. Illegally slaughtered meat is also referred to as hot meat or botcha.\n\nDouble-dead meat comes from pigs that died from disease which are illegally cut up for sale. This meat has a dark hide and the hairs of the skin remains stuck to the fat even if it is dipped in boiling water. Hot meat on the other hand can be fit for human consumption but did not pass the necessary sanitary standards. The sale of double-dead meat is against the law in the Philippines, where under the Republic Act 9296 also known as the Meat Inspection Code and specifically the Consumer Act of the Philippines, a violator faces the penalty of a fine amounting to between Php 1,000.00 and Php 10,000.00 plus not less than six months but not more than five years imprisonment. The National Meat Inspection Service (NMIS) is tasked to monitor the meat industry process from the slaughterhouse to the markets. They are also able to confiscate meat products that were unable to pass their standards. Any person who is caught violating RA 9296 will face a cease and desist order. Their meat products are seized and buried to prevent it from being recovered and re-entering the market. The government of Quezon City is also planning on raising harsher penalties for trading illegal meat such as the immediate revocation of the business permit of the offending sellers.\n\nDouble-dead meat is usually pale in color with a greenish-gray tint, a sticky consistency, foul-smelling and cold, a sign that the meat has been frozen. It also commands a lower price when compared to fresh meat. Consumption of hot meat is a health hazard and may result in diarrhea and food poisoning. There is an increase in the monitoring for double-dead meat during December 2008 due the reported incidence of Reston ebolavirus in four farms in Bulacan. There was a high demand for meat at that time due to it being Christmas.\n\nAn episode of \"Bitag\", an investigative television program hosted by Ben Tulfo investigated a case of hot meat commerce in Bulacan.

{"id": "736575", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=736575", "title": "Feronia (mythology)", "text": "Feronia (mythology)\n\nIn ancient Roman religion, Feronia was a goddess associated with wildlife, fertility, health, and abundance. As the goddess who granted freedom to slaves or civil rights to the most humble part of society, she was especially honored among plebeians and freedmen. Her festival, the \"Feroniae\", was November 13 (the \"ides\" of November) during the \"Ludi Plebeii\" (\"Plebeian Games\"), in conjunction with Fortuna Primigenia; both were goddesses of Praeneste.\n\nFeronia's name is derived from a Sabine adjective corresponding to Latin \"fĕrus\". \"Feronia\" comes from Etruscan, but with a long vowel, i.e. \"Fērōnǐa\". The root \"fer\" has cognate words in every Indo-European language (e.g. Greek θήρ, θήριον) and is also the root of the Vedic god Rudrá’s name. Latin \"fĕrus\" means \"not cultivated, untamed\" (\"Thesaurus Linguae Latinae\"), \"of the field, wood\", \"untamed\", \"not mitigated by any cultivation\" (Forcellini \"Totius Latinatis Lexicon\") which fits the environment of the sanctuaries of Feronia and is very close to \"rudis\" (rude).\n\nFeronia is one of the Roman and Italic goddesses whose name is formed by a root ending with the suffix \"-ona\" or \"-onia\". This form of a noun denotes a difficult or dangerous state or condition: The deity is a sovereign of that danger, only to help man to best avoid damage or get the greatest advantage, such as Angerona for the \"angusti dies\" near the winter solstice.\n\nMany versions of Feronia’s cult have been supposed, and it is not quite clear that she was only one goddess or had only one function in ancient times. Some Latins believed Feronia to be a harvest goddess, and honoured her with the harvest firstfruits in order to secure a good harvest the following year.\n\nFestus's entry on the \"picus Feronius\" of Trebula Mutuesca testifies the goddess had also prophetic qualities among the Sabines, as did the \"picus martius\" of Tiora Matiena ascribed to the Aborigines. Feronia also served as a goddess of travellers, fire, and waters.\n\nVarro identified Feronia with Libertas, the goddess who personified Liberty. According to Servius, Feronia was a tutelary goddess of freedmen (\"dea libertorum\"). A stone at the Terracina shrine was inscribed \"let deserving slaves sit down so that they may stand up free.\" Livy notes that in 217 BCE freed women collected money as a gift for Feronia.\nSome sources state that slaves were set free at her temple near Terracina.\n\nShe was among the deities that Sabine moneyers placed on their coins to honor their heritage. She may have been introduced into Roman religious practice when Manius Curius Dentatus conquered Sabinum in the early 3rd century BCE.\n\nTwo stories about her sanctuary of Terracina highlight the character of Feronia as goddess of the wilderness: Servius writes that when a fire destroyed her wood and the locals were about moving the statues to another location, the burnt wood suddenly turned green.\n\nPliny states that all attempts at building towers in times of war between Terracina and the sanctuary of Feronia have been abandoned because all are without exception destroyed by lightning bolts. The goddess thus refused any continuity and linkage with the nearby town.\n\nIn Vergil's \"Aeneid\", troops from Feronia's grove fight on the side of Turnus against Aeneas. The Arcadian king Evander recalls how in his youth he killed a son of Feronia, Erulus, who like Geryon had a triple body and a triple soul; Evander thus had to kill him thrice. Vergil identifies Erulus as the king of Praeneste, but he is otherwise unknown in literature.\n\nGeorges Dumézil considers Feronia to be a goddess of wilderness, of untamed nature, and nature's vital forces – but honoured because she offers man the opportunity to put those forces to good use in acquiring nurture, health and fertility. She fecundates and heals, therefore despite her being worshipped only in the wild she receive the first-fruits of the harvest, because she permits men to domesticate the wild forces of vegetation, favouring the transformation of that which is uncouth into that which is cultivated. \n\nDumézil compares her to Vedic god Rudra: He is similar to Feronia in that he represents that which has not yet been transformed by civilization – he is the god of the \"rude\", of the jungle, at one time dangerous and uniquely useful, healer thanks to the herbs within his domain, protector of the freed slaves and of the outcast. Feronia, though, has only the positive or useful function of putting the forces of wild nature at the service of man.\n\nInscriptions to Feronia are found mostly in central Italy. Ferona's shrines were all located in the wild, far from human settlements. Varro, however, places Feronia in his list of Sabine gods who had altars in Rome.\n\nFeronia's cults at Aquileia and Terracina were near springs that were used in her rites. The Augustan poet Horace speaks of the water \"(lympha)\" of Feronia, in which \"we bathe our face and hands.\"\n\nHer \"lucus\" at Capena was a place where everybody was allowed to come for worship and trade, attracting people from different nations, Sabines, Latins, Etruscans, and others from even farther away. The grove provided everybody with a neutral territory in which peace must not be perturbed.\n\nFeronia’s temple at the base of Mt. Soracte which was near Capena. The \"Lucus Feroniae\", or \"grove of Feronia\" (Fiano Romano) was the site of an annual festival in her honour, which was in the nature of a trade fair. The place, in the territory of Capena in southwestern Etruria, was plundered of its gold and silver by Hannibal's retreating troops in 211 BCE, when he turned aside from the Via Salaria to visit the sanctuary; later it became an Augustan \"colonia\". Its status as a colony is recorded in a single inscription, copied in a manuscript of the rule of the Farfa Abbey as \"colonia Iulia Felix Lucoferonensis\".\n\nAnother important site was near Anxur (Terracina, southern Latium), in a wood three Roman miles from the town, where Servius recorded a joint cult of \"the boy Jupiter\" (\"puer Iuppiter\") under the name of Anxyrus and \"Juno the Virgin\" (\"Iuno virgo\"), whom he identifies as Feronia. According to another tradition, slaves who had just been freed might go to the shrine at Terracina and receive upon their shaved heads the \"pileus\", a hat that symbolized their liberty.\nHer temple in the Campus Martius, in what is now Largo di Torre Argentina, was probably located in a grove as well according to an inscription found on the site. It was established before 217 BCE. It may have been dedicated by Curtius Dentatus following his victory over the Sabines. His building program also included the Anio Vetus, a major new aqueduct, and a number of fountains near the temple.\n\nCharles Godfrey Leland found surviving traditions concerning the \"witch\" Feronia in 19th century \nTuscany.\n\nThe asteroid 72 Feronia is named for her. \n"}

CDC estimates that there are approximately 19 million new STD infections yearly. The two most commonly reported infectious diseases with 1.5 million total cases (2009) are chlamydia and gonorrhea. Adolescent girls (15–19 years of age) and young women (20–24 years of age) are especially affected by these two diseases.\n\nChlamydia remains the most commonly reported infectious disease in the United States. There were more than 1.2 million cases of chlamydia (1,244,180) reported to CDC in 2009, the largest number of cases ever reported to CDC for any condition.\n\nThere were 301,174 reported cases of gonorrhea in 2009 (10 percent less than in 2008)— making gonorrhea the second most commonly reported infectious disease in the U.S. In 2009, the gonorrhea rate for women was slightly higher than for men.\n\nIn 2009, there were 13,997 reported cases of primary and secondary syphilis — the most infectious stages of the disease — the highest number of cases since 1995 and an increase over 2007 (11,466 cases).\n\n\nThe Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices makes scientific recommendations which are generally followed by the federal government, state governments, and private health insurance companies.\n\nAll 50 states in the U.S. mandate immunizations for children in order to enroll in public school, but various exemptions are available depending on the state. All states have exemptions for people who have medical contraindications to vaccines, and all states except for California, West Virginia, and Mississippi allow religious exemptions, while eighteen states allow parents to cite personal, conscientious, philosophical, or other objections. An increasing number of parents are using religious and philosophical exemptions: researchers have cited this increased use of exemptions as contributing to loss of herd immunity within these communities, and hence an increasing number of disease outbreaks.\n\nThe American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) advises physicians to respect the refusal of parents to vaccinate their child after adequate discussion, unless the child is put at significant risk of harm (e.g., during an epidemic, or after a deep and contaminated puncture wound). Under such circumstances, the AAP states that parental refusal of immunization constitutes a form of medical neglect and should be reported to state child protective services agencies.\n\nSee Vaccination schedule for the vaccination schedule used in the United States.\n\nImmunizations are often compulsory for military enlistment in the U.S.\n\nAll vaccines recommended by the U.S. government for its citizens are required for green card applicants. This requirement stirred controversy when it was applied to the HPV vaccine in July 2008 because of the cost of the vaccine, and because the other thirteen required vaccines prevent diseases which are spread by a respiratory route and are considered highly contagious, while HPV is only spread through sexual contact. In November 2009, this requirement was canceled.\n\nThe United States has a long history of school vaccination requirements. The first school vaccination requirement was enacted in the 1850s in Massachusetts to prevent the spread of smallpox. The school vaccination requirement was put in place after the compulsory school attendance law caused a rapid increase in the number of children in public schools, increasing the risk of smallpox outbreaks. The early movement towards school vaccination laws began at the local level including counties, cities, and boards of education. By 1827, Boston had become the first city to mandate that all children entering public schools show proof of vaccination. In addition, in 1855 the Commonwealth of Massachusetts had established its own statewide vaccination requirements for all students entering school, this influenced other states to implement similar statewide vaccination laws in schools as seen in New York in 1862, Connecticut in 1872, Pennsylvania in 1895, and later the Midwest, South and Western US. By 1963, 20 states had school vaccination laws.\n\nThese school vaccination resulted in political debates throughout the United States. An example of this political controversy occurred in 1893 in Chicago, where less than 10 percent of the children were vaccinated despite the twelve year old state law. Resistance was seen at the local level of the school district as some local school boards and superintendents opposed the state vaccination laws, leading the state board health inspectors to examine vaccination policies in schools. Resistance proceeded during the mid-1900s and in 1977 a nationwide Childhood Immunization Initiative was developed with the goal of increasing vaccination rates among children to 90% by 1979. During the two-year period of observation, the initiative reviewed the immunization records of more than 28 million children and vaccinated children who had not received the recommended vaccines.\n\nIn 1922 the constitutionality of childhood vaccination was examined in the Supreme Court case \"Zucht v. King\". The court decided that a school could deny admission to children who failed to provide a certification of vaccination for the protection of the public health. In 1987, a measles epidemic occurred in Maricopa County, Arizona and another court case, \"Maricopa County Health Department vs. Harmon\", examined the arguments of an individual's right to education over the states need to protect against the spread of disease. The court decided that it is prudent to take action to combat the spread of disease by denying un-vaccinated children a place in school until the risk for the spread of measles had passed. \nSchools in the United States require an updated immunization record for all incoming and returning students. While all states require an immunization record, this does not mean that all students must get vaccinated. Opt-out criteria is determined at a state level. In the United States, opt-outs take one of three forms: medical, in which a vaccine is contraindicated due to a component ingredient allergy or existing medical condition; religious; and personal philosophical opposition. As of 2015, 47 states allow religious exemptions, with some states requiring proof of religious membership. Only Mississippi, West Virginia and California do not permit religious exemptions. 18 states allow personal or philosophical opposition to vaccination.\n\nOver the last decade vaccination rates have been declining in the United States. Although the rate is fairly limited on a larger scale, vaccine-preventable disease outbreaks are occurring in pockets across the U.S. “In 2012, exemption rates ranged from a low of approximately 0.45 percent in New Mexico, to a high of 6.5 percent in Oregon. The outbreaks have significant correlations with unvaccinated children, and state policy exemption processes. California, which is currently in the process of changing their state exemption policies, dealt with a recent, 2015, measles outbreak stemming from the popular Disneyland park. Significantly, most of the afflicted were unvaccinated, which eventually spread to over 17 separate states across the U.S. If the federal government works to provide an equal vaccination regualtion nationally, immunization rates should begin to rise, while preventable outbreaks should diminish.\n\nIn 1790, people over the age of 65 were less than 2% of the American population. In 2017, they are about 14%.\n\n"}

Through the use of activity modifications and assistive technology, athletes or participants in sports or other recreational pursuits are able to play alongside their non-disabled peers. The Boy Scouts of America, for example, has about 100,000 physically or mentally disabled members throughout the United States.\n\nActivity modifications are changes made to a game or activity that allow all players to have an equal or more equal chance of doing well. One example of an activity modification is a wheelchair basketball game, where players use wheelchairs. The players' inability to walk is not a factor in how well they play.\n\nAssistive devices are any machines or equipment used to level the playing field in a mixed-ability competition, or to allow someone the opportunity to participate that could not do so without its benefit. Good examples of assistive devices are swimming pool lifts that lower non-ambulatory swimmers into a pool, and standing frames that allow wheelchair users to stand up while playing ball. Many municipal governments in the U.S. use adaptive recreation as a way to meet the requirements of the Americans With Disabilities Act (ADA), specifically its section dealing with public services. Governments are required by ADA law to provide reasonable accommodation to people with disabilities in order to allow them participation in sports and recreation programs.\n1. \"Power hockey\" is shown, played using electric wheelchairs in a gymnasium, and low nets.<br>\n2.

Some activities require few modifications. Here, wheelchair users participate in glider flying as pilots, at Portmoak Airfield, Scotlandwell, Scotland, UK.\n\nSome organizations have the means to establish large programs for many participants in an activity. A plan for creating inclusive recreation may include staff training on inclusive practices, the purchase or construction of universally-accessible equipment, and tracking success and addressing further accessibility needs as they arise. A variety of inclusion concepts and models exist, which may focus on inclusive recreation program content, or on the processes of inclusion themselves. These include the Cincinnati Model for Inclusion, the Supportive Recreation Inclusion (SRI) Model, the Together We Play (TWP) service-delivery model, and the CITI Model, among many others. \n\nStaff training is a crucial step in managing the success of an inclusive recreation program. A lack of awareness on the part of staff can have a negative impact on recreation participants; for example, assuming inappropriately that a person with a visual-impairment needs to be spoken to in a loud and slow voice can result in the participant disengaging from the activity. Training recommendations may include addressing both negative attitudes and behaviours through \"personal contact and interaction\", by working with people with disabilities. Staff are encouraged to promote \"self-determination\" among recreation participants, which \"increases a person's learning and sense of competence\".\n\nTherapeutic recreation is intended to help a patient adapt to a chronic disabling condition. A certified therapeutic recreation specialist uses their specialized training, along with professional standards, to develop programs that can accommodate the particular needs of patients. Therapeutic recreation may be part of a school's special education programming, or it may be part of a hospital's, community's, or organization's programs.\n\n<br>\n1.

It manifests itself in children; it is the pediatric counterpart of dermatomyositis. In JDM, the body's immune system attacks blood vessels throughout the body, causing inflammation called vasculitis. In the United States, the incidence rate of JDMS is approximately 2-3 cases per million children per year. The UK incidence is believed to be between 2-3 per million children per year, with some difference between ethnic groups. The sex ratio (Female : Male) is approximately 2:1. Other Idiopathic inflammatory myopathies include; juvenile polymyositis (PM), which is rare and not as common in children as in adults.\n\nThe vasculitis caused by JDMS manifests itself predominantly in two ways:\n\nOne is a distinctive rash. The rash often affects the face, eyelids, and hands, and sometimes the skin above joints, including the knuckles, knees, elbows, etc. The color of the rash is a pinkish purple, and is called heliotrope (after a flower of the same name with approximately this color). On the hands and face, the rash very closely resembles allergies, eczema, fifth disease, or other more common skin condition, but the heliotrope color is unique to the inflammatory process of JDMS. Some children develop calcinosis, which are calcium deposits under the skin. The rash is the source of the \"dermato-\" part of the name of the disease.\n\nThe second symptom caused by vasculitis is muscle inflammation. This symptom is the source of the \"-myositis\" part of the name of the disease (\"myo\" = muscle, \"-itis\" = inflammation of). Muscle Inflammation causes muscle weakness, which can cause fatigue, clumsiness, not keeping up physically with peers, and eventually inability to perform tasks like climbing stairs, lifting objects, and performing other manual tasks. Other signs may include falling, dysphonia, or dysphagia. The muscle weakness often causes a medical misdiagnosis of muscular dystrophy or other muscle disease. Some patients develop contractures, when the muscle shortens and causes joints to stay bent; exercise, occupational therapy, and physical therapy can prevent this. The muscles first affected tend to be proximal (i.e., neck, shoulders, back, and abdominal). About half of children with JDMS also have pain in their muscles.\n\nOther symptoms may include irritability, weight loss, and mouth ulcers. When a child becomes irritable, fatigued, reluctant to socialize, and the face becomes flushed easily, physicians refer to this constellation of symptoms as \"misery.\"\n\nThe speed of the progression of JDMS is highly variable. Nearly all JDM patients have some skin involvement. The JDMS rash usually occurs as the initial symptom. Sometimes it is so slight as not to be recognized for what it is until muscle symptoms appear. Sometimes muscle symptoms never appear at all or occur very gradually over the course of months, and sometimes going from normal strength to being unable to walk within days. Usually, muscle symptoms appear weeks to months after the onset of the rash.\n\nThe underlying cause of JDM is unknown. It most likely has a genetic component, as other autoimmune disease tend to run in the families of patients. The disease is usually triggered by a condition that causes immune system activity that does not stop as it should, but the trigger is almost certainly not the cause in most cases. Common triggers include immunizations, infections, injuries, and sunburn.\n\nProximal muscle weakness, characteristic skin rash and elevated muscle enzymes are routinely used to identify JDM. Typical magnetic resonance imaging and muscle biopsy changes are considered the next most useful diagnostic criteria, followed by myopathic changes on electromyogram, calcinosis, dysphonia and nailfold capillaroscopy. Other useful criteria include myositis-specific or -related antibodies, nailfold capillaroscopy, factor VIII-related antigen, muscle ultrasound, calcinosis and neopterin.\n\nOnce a diagnosis of JDMS is made, the treatment is often a 3-day course of Intravenous (\"pulse\") steroids (methylprednisolone, Solu-Medrol), followed by a high dose of oral prednisone (usually 1–2 mg/kg of body weight) for several weeks. This action usually brings the disease under control, lowering most lab tests to or near normal values. Some minor improvement in muscle symptoms may also be seen in this time, but normally it takes a long time for full muscle strength to be regained.\n\nOnce the disease process is under control, oral steroids are tapered gradually to minimize their side effects. Often, steroid-sparing drugs, such as methotrexate (a chemotherapy drug) or other DMARDs, are given to compensate for the reduction in oral steroids. Once the oral steroids are reduced to a less toxic level, the sparing agents can also be gradually withdrawn. Lab results are closely monitored during the tapering process to ensure that the disease does not recur.\n\nIn the cases where steroids or second-line drugs are not tolerated or are ineffective, there are other treatments that can be tried. These include other chemotherapy drugs, such as ciclosporin, infliximab, or other DMARDs. Another is intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIg), a blood product that has been shown to be very effective against JDMS.\n\nTo treat the skin rash, anti-malarial drugs, such as hydroxychloroquine (Plaquenil) are usually given. Topical steroid creams (hydrocortisone) may help some patients, and anti-inflammatory creams (such as tacrolimus) are proving to be very effective. Dry skin caused by the rash can be combatted by regular application of sunscreen or any moisturizing cream. Most JDM patients are very sensitive to sun exposure, and sunburn may be a disease activity trigger in some, so daily application of high-SPF sunscreen is often recommended.\n\nOf the children diagnosed with and treated for JDM, about half will recover completely. Close to 30 percent will have weakness after the disease resolves. Most children will go into remission and have their medications eliminated within two years, while others may take longer to respond or have more severe symptoms that take longer to clear up.\n\nA common lasting effect of JDM is childhood arthritis.\n"}

It migrates to the surface and deposits a molecular film (10mm).\n\nThe mixture of aliphatic amine surfactants is a micro and macro anti-fouling material that acts as a corrosion inhibitor and scale dispersant as well as having activity against freshwater and saltwater mussels and barnacles. It adsorbs to exposed surfaces and forms a protective anti-fouling biofilm on internal components when present is circulating water. Once the material is absorbed to a surface, biofouling organisms cannot form an attachment and it remains in place until it degrades, and this minimizes its presence in outfall.\n\nBy removing the biofilm from system surfaces, Mexel 432 is effective in inhibiting toxic algae (Naegleria fowleri) blooms and growth of bacteria colonies by species including SRB, TRB and legionella. Mexel 432 is not sufficiently toxic to kill these organisms in the water column, but it retards population growth by eliminating their habitat.\n\nThe emulsion is non-oxidant and tensioactive.\n\nMexel 432 offers a solution for the protection of open and semi open cooling circuits, such as:\n- Thermal, Nuclear and Hydro Power Plants\n- Ships, Industrial Plants (steel& paper, Oil & Gas, refineries, offshore rigs, LPG units)\n- Irrigation, Water Networks, Sewage Plants\n- Desalination Plants\n- Fire fighting systems using fresh or salt water\n\nThe Mexel process is today installed in a large number of power stations worldwide.\n\n- No impact on the environment\n- Not toxic to Mammals\n- Over two year shelf life\n- Biodegradable\n- Non oxidant\n- Non dispersant\n- Anti fouling\n- Anti scaling\n\n\n1.

Berry Brazelton and his colleagues. This test purports to provide an index of a newborn's abilities, and is usually given to an infant somewhere between the age of 3 days to 4 weeks old. This approach was innovative for recognizing that a baby is a highly developed organism, even when just newly born. The profile describes the baby's strengths, adaptive responses and possible vulnerabilities. This knowledge may help parents develop appropriate strategies for caring in intimate relationships to enhance their earliest relationship with the child.\n\nThe Brazelton scale produces a total of 47 scores, of which 27 are behavioral related and 20 are elicited responses. These scores measure a variety of areas including the \"neurological, social, and behavioral aspects of a newborn's functioning.\" Additionally, \"factors such as reflexes, responses to stress, startle reactions, cuddliness, motor maturity, ability to habituate to sensory stimuli, and hand-mouth coordination are all assessed.\"\n\nValidity evidence is strong for the Brazelton scale, providing a considerable research base. This scale has been used widely as a research tool as well as a diagnostic tool for special purposes. Following is a list of various research projects that have implemented the Brazelton scale:\n\nDespite the influence of the Brazelton scale, it has some drawbacks. The biggest is that no norms are available. Therefore, as examiners and researchers say that one infant scored higher than another one, there is no standard sample with which to compare. Further, the scores are not completely understood; further testing is required. As for validity, it has \"poorly documented predictive and construct validity.\" It also does not do a good job at predicting later intelligence, although the scale is supposed to assess the \"infant's role in the mother-infant social relationship\" from which high scores are supposed to presume \"high levels of intelligence.\".\n\nTherefore, the value of the test is as a research tool and a supplement test to medical testing procedures. But as a predictor of future intelligence, it is very unsatisfactory. Because of this, some wonder what the scale is really measuring.\n\nTraining is necessary for effective and reliable administration of the NBAS.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "56117904", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=56117904", "title": "Neuwirth Law", "text": "Neuwirth Law\n\nThe Neuwirth Law is a French law which lifted the ban on birth control methods on December 28, 1967, including oral contraception. It was passed by the National Assembly on December 19, 1967. The law is named after Lucien Neuwirth, the Gaullist politician who proposed it. It replaced a law from 1920 that not only forbade all forms of contraception, but also information about contraception. The law was not fully implemented until 1972 due to administrative breakdowns.\n\nFollowing the great losses of the First World War, all birth control means and their promotion had been banned in 1920 to ensure population growth. However, some French people could still get information and products from abroad. Several proposals had been made to unban birth control before 1966. In 1965, legalization of oral contraception was discussed by François Mitterrand during that year's presidential election, which shocked General Charles de Gaulle. Eleven bills were proposed between 1958 and 1967 and none of them made it onto the agenda.\n\nNeuwirth was a long-time opponent to the 1920 law, and faced opposition from the right to repeal it. He met with de Gaulle to provide reasoning for a new bill, and de Gaulle relented in letting one be drafted and considered. With some help from the French birth control movement (\"Mouvement français du planning familial\" ), Neuwirth wrote a law draft to legalize birth control in May of 1966. \n\nNeuwirth created a special commission with other members Mitterand and Marie-Claude Vaillant-Couturier. This commission brought in various institutions, associations, and scientists including Jacques Monod, François Jacob, Alfred Sauvy and Pierre Bourdieu. Neuwirth wrote a second bill representing the work of the commission and presented it to the new assembly on April 12, 1967. The assembly debates were sharp, but disciplined. The critics were mainly the conservatives who relayed the positions of Catholic organizations and \"l’Ordre des médecins\" - a national doctor organization. Debate concentrated around limits and freedom of prescriptions. Proponents for creating limits for contraceptive prescriptions noted the existing requirement on the practice of therapeutic abortion, where the opinion of three doctors was necessary.\n\nFormally proposed during the spring of 1967, the Neuwirth Law, or the \"loi relative à la régulation des naissances et abrogeant les articles L. 648 et L. 649 du code de la santé publique\", as approved by the joint committee, was passed with left-wing support on 19 December 1967. The law received support from all of the opposition party and part of the majority party. It was promulgated on 28 December under the name ′law relative to birth regulation′. Contraception and the contraceptive pill were authorized by the law but were not reimbursable by Social security.\n\nThe relative executive decrees were blocked by the conservative government, notably Jean Foyer, then minister for Health, some as late as 1974. In the intervening years, oral contraceptives were on the market, but were routinely being prescribed for other purposes. In 1974, contraceptives became reimbursable under Social security.\n\nToday in France, contraception is regulated in articles L5134, R5134 and R2311-13 of the public health code. Abortion was not affected by the Neuwirth Law, and was prohibited until the Veil Law of January 17, 1975, which provided for the decriminalization of conditional abortion.\n\nJointly with the Veil Law of 1974 which unbanned abortion, the Neuwirth law allowed couples to reduce the number of both wanted and unwanted births, leading to a decrease of the fertility from 2.5 to 1.81 children by woman in 1985.\n"}

Roosevelt\n\nThe paralytic illness of Franklin D. Roosevelt began in 1921 when the future President of the United States was 39 years old. His main symptoms were fever; symmetric, ascending paralysis; facial paralysis; bowel and bladder dysfunction; numbness and hyperesthesia; and a descending pattern of recovery. Roosevelt was left permanently paralyzed from the waist down. He was diagnosed with poliomyelitis at the time, but his symptoms are more consistent with Guillain–Barré syndrome (GBS) – an autoimmune neuropathy which Roosevelt's doctors failed to consider as a diagnostic possibility. In 1926, his belief in the benefits of hydrotherapy led him to found a rehabilitation center at Warm Springs, Georgia. He avoided being seen using his wheelchair in public, but his disability was well known and became a major part of his image. In 1938, he founded the National Foundation for Infantile Paralysis, leading to the development of polio vaccines.\n\nIn August 1921, 39-year-old Franklin D. Roosevelt, at the time a practicing lawyer in New York, joined his family at their vacation home at Campobello, a Canadian island off the coast of Maine. As former Assistant Secretary of the Navy, he had spent two weeks in mid-July in Washington, D.C., giving testimony to a Senate committee investigating a Navy scandal. On August 5, Roosevelt sailed up the New England coast with his friend and new employer, Van Lear Black, on Black's ocean-going yacht. Among those at Campobello when Roosevelt arrived were his wife Eleanor, their children, his political aide Louis Howe, Howe's wife, and their young son.\n\nOn August 10, after a day of strenuous activity, Roosevelt came down with an illness characterized by fever, ascending paralysis, facial paralysis, prolonged bowel and bladder dysfunction, and numbness and hypersensitivity of the skin. Most of the symptoms resolved themselves, but he was left permanently paralyzed from the waist down.\n\nRoosevelt came close to death from the illness. He faced many life-threatening medical problems including the possibility of respiratory failure, urinary tract infection, injury to the urethra or bladder, decubitus ulcers, clots in the leg veins, and malnutrition. Eleanor’s nursing care was responsible for Roosevelt’s survival.\n\nJuly 28: \nRoosevelt visited the Boy Scout Jamboree at Bear Mountain State Park.\n\nAugust 5–8: \nRoosevelt traveled to Campobello on board the yacht \"Sabolo\".\n\nAugust 9:\nRoosevelt fell into the cold waters of the Bay of Fundy. Later, arrived at Campobello.\n\nAugust 10:\nRoosevelt spent the day physically active. Afterward, he complained of chills, nausea, and pain in his lower back. He skipped dinner and went to bed. Chills lasted through the night. \n\nAugust 11:\nIn the morning, one of his legs felt weak. Roosevelt had fever.\nDr. Eben H. Bennet, a general practitioner in the nearby village of Lubec who had known the Roosevelts for years, visited Roosevelt and diagnosed a bad summer cold. By the evening, one leg was paralyzed, and the other had become weak. \n\nAugust 12:\nBoth legs were paralyzed. His temperature was 102 °F. Pain shot through his legs, feet and back.\nBennet suggested a consultation with Dr. William W. Keen, an eminent retired neurosurgeon vacationing nearby.\nRoosevelt's legs were numb. They then became painfully sensitive to touch. He could not pass urine. By evening, his hands were affected.\n\nAugust 13:\nRoosevelt was paralyzed from the chest down. On that day and the following, his hands, arms, and shoulders were weak. He had difficulty moving his bowels and required enemas.\nKeen made what Eleanor described as \"a most careful, thorough examination\".\n\nAugust 14:\nRoosevelt continued to be unable to pass urine for two weeks, and required catheterization. His fever continued for a total of six to seven days.\nKeen repeated his examination, a bending and prodding that Elliott later termed \"excruciating\" for his father.\nKeen diagnosed a clot of blood to the lower spinal cord, and prescribed massage of the leg muscles.\nEleanor and Howe began massaging Roosevelt's legs as instructed by Keen, bringing on agonizing pain.\n\nAugust 15:\nProstrate and mildly sedated, Roosevelt was occasionally delirious.\n\nAugust 19:\nFrederic Delano, Roosevelt's uncle, had received a letter from Louis Howe requesting to find a doctor to come see Roosevelt. Delano called his son-in-law, a physician, who recommended he speak to another physician, a Dr. Parker. Parker told Delano that the case sounded like infantile paralysis, and that the leading authorities on the disease were at the Harvard Infantile Paralysis Commission in Boston. Delano caught a train and arrived the next morning.\n\nAugust 20:\nDr. Samuel A. Levine was at his office when Delano telephoned Brigham Hospital on Saturday morning. Levine said the senior members of the Harvard Infantile Paralysis Commission, Dr. Lovett and Dr. Peabody, were out of town, but he would try to answer Delano's questions. After reviewing the messages Delano had received from Campobello, Levine thought Roosevelt was suffering from acute poliomyelitis. He urged that a lumbar puncture be done, with the goal of making a diagnosis, but mainly because Levine believed there could be acute benefit from the procedure. \nDelano phoned and wrote Eleanor the same day, advising her to stop massaging Roosevelt's legs, and to disregard Keen's advice: \"I think it would be very unwise to trust his diagnosis where the Inf. Paralysis can be determined by test of the spinal fluid.\"\nEleanor communicated with Keen, who \"very strenuously\" resisted the idea of poliomyelitis. Keen asked Lovett to visit Campobello.\n\nAugust 22:\nLovett met Levine for dinner. Lovett asked how to distinguish whether paralysis was caused by poliomyelitis or by a clot or lesion of the spinal cord.\n\nAugust 23:\nLovett left for Campobello.\n\nAugust 24:\nLovett saw Roosevelt and performed a \"more or less superficial\" examination since Roosevelt was highly sensitive to touch. The arms were weak; the bladder was paralyzed; the left thumb indicated atrophy. Roosevelt could not stand or walk, and Lovett documented \"scattered weakness, most marked in the hips\".\n\nAugust 25:\nRoosevelt's temperature was 100 °F. Both legs were paralyzed. His back muscles were weak. There was also weakness of the face and left hand. Pain in the legs and inability to urinate continued. \nAfter a brief conference with Keen, Lovett saw Roosevelt. Lovett informed him that the \"physical findings\" presented a \"perfectly clear\" diagnosis of poliomyelitis.\nLovett ordered an end to massage, which had no benefit and caused pain, and recommended a trained nurse to care for Roosevelt.\n\nSeptember 1:\nRoosevelt was still unable to urinate. His leg pain continued.\n\nSeptember 14:\nRoosevelt was transported to New York, by boat and train, a long and painful journey.\n\nSeptember 15:\nRoosevelt was admitted to Presbyterian Hospital in New York City for convalescence, under the care of Dr. George Draper, an expert on poliomyelitis and Roosevelt's personal physician. Lovett continued to consult from Boston.\nThere was pain in the legs, paralysis of the legs, muscle wasting in the lower lumbar area and the buttocks, weakness of the right triceps, and gross muscle twitching in both forearms.\n\nOctober 28:\nRoosevelt was transferred from Presbyterian Hospital to his house on East 65th Street. His chart still read \"not improving\".\n\nLater:\nRoosevelt exercised daily. His hamstrings tightened, and his legs were encased in plaster to straighten them by degrees.\nThere was gradual recovery, but he remained paralyzed from the waist down.\n\nAfter falling ill, Roosevelt was seen by four doctors. Eben Homer Bennet, the Roosevelt family doctor, diagnosed a heavy cold. William Keen, a retired neurosurgeon, thought Roosevelt had a blood clot. Robert Lovett, an expert on the orthopedic management of children paralyzed from poliomyelitis, diagnosed \"infantile paralysis\", as did George Draper, Roosevelt's personal physician.\n\nRoosevelt's physicians never mentioned Guillain–Barré syndrome (GBS) in their communications concerning Roosevelt's case, indicating that they were not aware of it as a diagnostic possibility. All reports before 1921 of what is now called GBS were by European physicians, in European journals. The result was that very few American physicians knew that GBS was a separate disease. For example, Lovett mistakenly believed that Landry’s ascending paralysis, now termed GBS, was one of the clinical presentations of paralytic polio. In 1921, an American physician would assume that if an individual developed a sudden, non-traumatic flaccid paralysis, it was due to paralytic polio. The concept of GBS as a separate disease was not widely accepted in the United States until after the Second World War.\n\nRoosevelt first traveled to Warm Springs, Georgia, on October 3, 1924. For many years to come Warm Springs would be where he would retreat in comfort for hydrotherapy. On April 29, 1926, he bought the center with the intention of making it into a rehabilitation center for polio patients. One of Roosevelt's primary goals was to get the American Orthopedic Association to endorse the resort, but he was rejected because there was no real progress in physical health.\n\nIn 1929 Roosevelt was elected Governor of New York and moved into the Governor's Mansion in Albany. Before he moved in, the mansion was made wheelchair-friendly with ramps and an elevator.\n\nRoosevelt won the Presidential election in 1932 in a landslide victory and became the first, and so far only, disabled person to be President of the United States. Before he moved into the White House, ramps were added to make it wheelchair-friendly. Any pictures of the President were taken at certain angles and at a distance.\n\nRoosevelt was totally and permanently paralyzed from the waist down, and unable to stand or walk without support. For the next few months, he confined himself to indoor pursuits, including resuming his lifelong hobby of stamp collecting. In December 1921, after he had recuperated for several months, a physiotherapist began working with him to determine the extent of the damage. He was able to perform small exercises on his own, moving one muscle and then another. He was fitted with heavy steel braces that locked at the knee and provided enough stability that he could stand with crutches. In 1922, at Springwood, he worked diligently to make his way across the room. He set himself the goal of getting down the long driveway, managing to do it once, but never trying again.\n\nIn October 1922, Roosevelt visited his law office at the Equitable Building, where a welcome-back luncheon had been arranged. The chauffeur assisting him failed to brace the tip of his left crutch and Roosevelt fell onto the highly polished lobby floor. Laughing, he asked two young men in the crowd of onlookers to help get him back on his feet. After the luncheon, he told friends it was a \"grand and glorious occasion\". He did not return to his office for two months.\n\nRoosevelt believed that warmth and exercise would help rebuild his legs. He bought a run-down 71-foot houseboat and, in February 1923, sailed to Florida with friends and a small crew. Eleanor found it dull and left, but Roosevelt sailed for weeks, fishing and spending time with a succession of friends who came to visit. He designed a pulley system that lowered him into the water to swim. In May 1923, Lovett documented no overall improvement over the preceding year, but Roosevelt would not accept his doctors' determination that further progress was unlikely. He tried a range of therapies and made two more voyages on his houseboat, but his efforts had no effect.\n\n\"Between 1925 and 1928, Franklin would spend more than half his time—116 of 208 weeks—away from home, struggling to find a way to regain his feet,\" wrote biographer Geoffrey Ward. \"Eleanor was with him just 4 of those 116 weeks, and his mother was with him for only 2. His children hardly saw him.\"\n\nRoosevelt lost the use of his legs and two inches of height, but the subsequent development of the rest of his body gave him a robust physique, and he enjoyed many years of excellent health. Jack Dempsey praised his upper-body musculature, and Roosevelt once landed a 237-pound shark after fighting it on his line for two hours.\n\nWith his physiotherapist at Warm Springs, Roosevelt laboriously taught himself to walk short distances while wearing iron braces on his hips and legs, by swiveling his torso. For this \"two-point walk\", he would grip the arm of a strong person with his left hand, and brace himself with a cane in his right.\n\nRoosevelt was the United States' first disabled president, so there has been discussion concerning how he handled his health. Disability advocate Hugh Gallagher posited that Roosevelt was desperate to appear able-bodied. When discussing Roosevelt's limited use of a wheelchair in public, Gallagher stated, \"This was not by accident. It was a strategy that served to minimize the extent of his handicap, to make it unnoticed when possible and palatable when it was noticed.\". Historian James Tobin argued that Roosevelt used his disability to his advantage. Tobin stated, \"But he could, instead, show himself to be something he had never been seen as before: a fighter and, and better yet, an underdog; not a man to pity, not a man to envy, but a man to cheer.\" Despite any controversy, Roosevelt has become an inspirational figure for disabled people around the world. The Roosevelt Memorial in Washington, D.C. includes a statue of Roosevelt in a wheelchair.\n\nRoosevelt was able to convince many people that he was getting better, which he believed was essential if he was to run for public office again. In private he used a wheelchair but was careful not to be seen in it in public, although he sometimes appeared on crutches. He usually appeared in public standing upright, while being supported on one side by an aide or one of his sons. For major speaking occasions, an especially solid lectern was placed on the stage so that he could support himself on it; as a result, in films of his speeches, Roosevelt can be observed using his head to make gestures because his hands were gripping the lectern. He might raise one hand to gesture, but his other hand held the podium.\n\nHis public appearances were choreographed to avoid the press covering his arrival and departure, which would have shown him getting into or out of a vehicle. When possible, his vehicle was driven into a building's parking garage for his arrivals and departures. On other occasions, the vehicle would be driven onto a ramp to avoid steps, which Roosevelt was unable to ascend. When that was not practical, the steps would be covered with a ramp with railings, with Roosevelt using his arms to pull himself upward. When traveling by train, Roosevelt often appeared on the rear platform of the presidential railroad car. When he boarded or disembarked, the private car was sometimes shunted to an area of the railroad yard away from the public for reasons of security and privacy. When Roosevelt's train used a ramp and the president was on a publicly known trip, he insisted on walking on the ramp no matter how difficult.\n\nJournalist John Gunther reported that in the 1930s he often met people in Europe, including world leaders, who were unaware of Roosevelt's paralysis. David Brinkley, who was a young White House reporter in World War II, stated that the Secret Service actively interfered with photographers who tried to take pictures of Roosevelt in a wheelchair or being moved about by others. The Secret Service commonly destroyed photographs they caught being taken in this manner; however, there were occasional exceptions. When Roosevelt addressed the Congress in person on March 1, 1945, about a month before his death, he made public reference to his disability for almost the first time in 20 years. \"I hope that you will pardon me for this unusual posture of sitting down,\" Roosevelt began, \"but I know you will realize that it makes it a lot easier for me not to have to carry about ten pounds of steel around on the bottom of my legs.\"\n\nOn January 3, 1938, Roosevelt founded the National Foundation for Infantile Paralysis, now known as the March of Dimes. Basil O'Connor, an attorney and close associate of Roosevelt, helped establish the foundation and was its president for more than three decades. The organization's annual fundraising campaign coincided with Roosevelt's birthday on January 30. The organization initially focused on the rehabilitation of victims of paralytic polio and supported the work of Jonas Salk and others that led to the development of polio vaccines. Today, the March of Dimes focuses on preventing premature births, congenital disabilities, and infant mortality.\n\nBecause he founded the March of Dimes, a dime was chosen to honor Roosevelt after his death. The Roosevelt dime was issued on January 30, 1946.\n\nRoosevelt's center at Warm Springs operates today as the Roosevelt Warm Springs Institute for Rehabilitation, a comprehensive rehabilitation facility operated by the state of Georgia. A center for post-polio treatment, it provides vocational rehabilitation, long-term acute care, and inpatient rehabilitation for amputees and people recovering from spinal cord injuries, brain damage, and stroke.\n\nA 2003 peer-reviewed study of Roosevelt's paralytic illness, using three diagnostic methods - pattern recognition, reconstructing the pathogenesis, and Bayesian analysis - favored a diagnosis of Guillain–Barré syndrome (GBS) over poliomyelitis. For the Bayesian analysis, the best estimate of the annual incidence of GBS was 1.3 per 100,000. For paralytic polio in Roosevelt's age group, an annual incidence of 1.0 per 100,000 was used. The paralytic polio rate was derived from the exceptionally severe polio epidemic that struck New York City in 1916, to tilt the odds in favor of polio. The prior probability of paralytic polio in Roosevelt’s age group in the United States in 1921 was likely much lower because paralytic polio was at one of its lowest ebbs in the Northeastern region of the country at that time. In July 1921, three cases were reported in New Jersey. By late August some 100 cases were reported in the state of New York. Based on the incidence rates for GBS and paralytic polio, and symptom probabilities from the medical literature, Roosevelt's symptoms were analyzed by Bayesian analysis to obtain posterior probabilities, as listed below.\n\nSix of eight symptoms favored GBS, with the posterior probability of GBS shown for each:\n\nTwo of eight symptoms favored polio, with the posterior probability of polio shown for each:\n\nUsing all eight symptoms in a Bayesian analysis, based on disease incidence rates and symptom probabilities from the medical literature, the overall probability that Roosevelt had GBS is over 99%.\n\nIt is possible Roosevelt was exposed to an infectious agent at the Boy Scout Jamboree in late July. The two-week interval before the onset of his neurological illness was in keeping with both the incubation period of poliomyelitis, and with exposure to an infectious agent leading to GBS. There are no reports that any scouts or personnel at the camp were ill around the time of Roosevelt’s visit. In 1912 and 1915, Roosevelt had illnesses compatible with \"Campylobacter jejuni\", a major causative agent of GBS.\n\nIt has been stated that Roosevelt may have been predisposed to paralytic polio by genetic inheritance. However, such a genetic predisposition has never been discovered. Several authors have stated that Roosevelt was more vulnerable to polio since he was raised on an isolated family estate and had little contact with other children until he entered Groton at age 14. However, Roosevelt was not a \"boy in a bubble\". He had many possible exposures to polioviruses before 1921. Most polio cases are asymptomatic or a mild illness. Yet those asymptomatic individuals can transmit the viral infection. When the prior probability of paralytic polio was artificially made 100-fold higher, to 99.4%, overall Bayesian analysis of Roosevelt's symptoms still greatly favored GBS (99.97% posterior probability). Roosevelt’s symptoms are typical of GBS, not of paralytic polio, so they overwhelm the initial prior probability.\n\nA 2014 book argued that a lumbar puncture was done, based on excerpts from an \"unpublished note\" by Dr. Samuel A. Levine of the Harvard Infantile Paralysis Commission. The book stated, \"Levine's private note indicates that Dr. Lovett did examine the cerebrospinal fluid and knew very well that a high level of white blood cells was consistent with poliomyelitis. . . . If Lovett had discovered a low white blood cell count, he would have doubted that poliomyelitis was the cause of Roosevelt's illness. Yet Lovett wrote George Draper that \"I thought [the diagnosis] was perfectly clear as far as the physical findings were concerned.\"\"\n\nA 2017 book finally published the note. Based on the full text, the note was not found to support the idea that a spinal tap was performed, because: \n1) The note, written many years after 1921, had many errors. \n2) Levine never saw Roosevelt. \n3) Levine did not mention who did the procedure, or the results. \n4) Lovett had made it clear he would not do the procedure. \n5) None of Roosevelt's physicians at Campobello were equipped to do the procedure. \n6) \"Physical findings\" means information gained from a physical examination of the patient. Lovett described many \"physical findings\": hyperesthesia, facial paralysis, etc. But neither he, any of Roosevelt's other physicians at Campobello, Roosevelt, Eleanor, nor any of Roosevelt's associates ever said that a spinal tap was done.\n\nThe 2017 book went on to say: \"Given the invasive nature of a spinal tap, and the difficulty that would have occurred doing the procedure on a patient in FDR’s condition, it seems highly unlikely that a direct observer would have failed to mention anything about it. . . . Even if a spinal tap had been performed, it would have been done at the earliest about 15 days after the onset of the neurological illness, around when Lovett first saw Roosevelt. . . . One should keep in mind that the classical distinction between paralytic polio and GBS, the concentrations of leukocytes and total protein in CSF, blurs after the first several days of the onset of paralysis in both diseases.\"\n\n\"In any event, there was no cure for either disease in 1921,\" wrote biographer Jonathan Alter. However, Levine mistakenly thought that the main benefit of a spinal tap, if done, would be to improve the outcome by lowering elevated CSF pressure. And even today, some authors mistakenly believe that Roosevelt's paralysis, assuming a polio diagnosis, could have been prevented with early intervention. However, there is no objective evidence that a spinal tap lessens the possibility of paralysis in polio. And it is unlikely Roosevelt's physicians would have tried human serum injections into the CSF, or that such injections would have helped. Lovett did not think the injections were useful, and there were alarming meningeal symptoms associated with them, probably secondary to the formation of antigen-antibody complexes. Concerning GBS, virtually all of the effective measures that are currently standard practice for the medical management of GBS were not developed until many decades after Roosevelt's 1921 illness, so Roosevelt's prognosis would not have improved even if GBS had been diagnosed.\n\n"}
{"id": "3824275", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=3824275", "title": "Peregrine Laziosi", "text": "Peregrine Laziosi\n\nSaint Peregrine Laziosi (Pellegrino Latiosi) (c. 1260 – 1 May 1345) is an Italian saint of the Servite Order (Friar Order Servants of Mary). He is the patron saint for persons suffering from cancer, AIDS, or other illness.\n\nPeregrine Laziosi was born around 1260, the only son of an affluent family in Forlì, in northern Italy. At that time Forli was part of the Papal States. Peregrine's family supported the anti-papal faction. In 1283 the residents of Forlì were under interdict. St. Philip Benizi, Prior General of the Friar Servants of Saint Mary, was sent to try to reconcile the divided community. While trying to preach in Forlì, Philip was heckled and struck by the eighteen-year-old Peregrine. He was driven from the city with insults and violence. Peregrine repented and asked Philip for forgiveness. St. Philip received him with kindness. The moment had a profound effect on Peregrine. Filled with remorse, he began to pray more and to channel his energies into good works. A few years later, he joined the Servites in Siena and went on to be ordained a priest.\n\nAfter some years he was sent back to Forlì, where he founded a new Servite house there and became well known for his preaching and holiness as well as his devotion to the sick and poor. It is said that he miraculously multiplied grain and wine during a severe shortage in his area. People took to calling him the \"Angel of Good Counsel,\" so grateful were they for his wise advice so freely given.\n\nOne of the special penances he imposed on himself was to stand whenever it was not necessary to sit. When tired he would support himself on a choir stall. At the age of sixty he developed an infection in his right leg. His condition deteriorated to the point that the physician decided to amputate his leg.\n\nThe night before the operation Peregrine spent time praying before a fresco of the Crucifixion in the chapter room. He fell into a deep trance-like sleep and seemed to see Jesus descend from the cross to touch his leg.\n\nThe following day, the doctor arrived to perform the amputation and finding no sign of the cancer, spread news of the miraculous cure throughout the town. This only increased the people’s regard for Peregrine. The saint died of a fever on May 1,1345 at the age of eighty five. An extraordinary number of people from the town and countryside honored him in death. Some of the sick who came were healed through his intercession.\n\nHis body rests in the Servite church of Forlì, the Basilica of Saint Pellegrino Laziosi. Pope Paul V declared him blessed in 1609 and Pope Benedict XIII canonized him in 1726. The liturgical feast of Saint Pellegrino/Peregrine is on May 1.\n\nPeregrine is considered the patron saint of those suffering from cancer. The National Shrine of Saint Peregrine is located at Our Lady of Sorrows Basilica in Chicago, Illinois, as a ministry of the Friar Servants of Mary. There is a St. Peregrine Shrine at The Grotto, at The National Sanctuary of Our Sorrowful Mother, in Portland, Oregon.s. A St. Peregrine Mass is celebrated at The Grotto on the first Saturday of each month at 12 noon in the Chapel of Mary. and there is also a St. Peregrine Shrine in Muntinlupa City in the Philippines. It houses a relic taken from St. Peregrine himself, a rib. It is currently on display in the church's Relic Chapel. There is a Saint Peregrine Cancer Shrine with Perpetual Eucharistic Adoration at Christ the King Catholic Church in Mesa, Arizona. The mission of this St. Peregrine Shrine is to promote perpetual adoration of Jesus Christ and to pray for those affected by cancer. In the midst of suffering, a sanctuary for spiritual healing and emotional peace is offered. \nThere also is a statue of St. Peregrine in the Mission church of San Juan Capistrano in southern California. (One does NOT have to be near a statue to ask St. Peregrine to intercede with God on one's behalf.)\n\nAccording to some, the lesson of Peregrine’s life is not that God worked a miracle, but that a faithful servant placed himself, unconditionally, in the hands of God. Peregrine’s trust in God therefore serves as a model for those dealing with sickness. However, his recovery has been cited as an example of the potency of the immune system in fighting cancer.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "40624233", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=40624233", "title": "Postmenopausal confusion", "text": "Postmenopausal confusion\n\nPostmenopausal confusion is a symptom of menopause; women face problems with cognition during and after menopause due to hormonal imbalances.\n\nEstrogen affects the serotonergic, cholinergic, dopaminergic, and noradrenergic systems, all of which are key to maintaining regular functioning in both survival and cognition. Seratonin and dopamine also play key roles in mood, which alters drastically with menopause as these hormone levels decrease, as a result of estrogen decline. Furthermore, the ratio of testosterone to estrogen changes as testosterone is now of higher quantity, causing a more easily angered disposition and allowing stress to seem more prevalent than before menopause.\n\nDuring menopause, the amygdala, which controls emotion, and the prefrontal cortex, which regulates judgment, become more regular. Estrogens, a group of hormones including estradiol and estrone, are secreted by the ovaries and the secretion is regulated by leutenizing hormone (LH) and follicle stimulating hormone (FSH), both of which are produced by the pituitary gland. In women, estrogen levels fluctuate during the menstrual cycle but reach a steady decline and then remain at low levels postmenopause.\n\nBehavioral studies suggest that estradiol augments cognition that occurs within the prefrontal cortex and hippocampus. It can also enhance long term potentiation (LTP) which is key at the neurocellular level for memory and learning and is mostly affected at the neuroanatomical level of CA1 pyramidal cells, NMDAr receptors, and AMPAr receptors.\n\nMicroglia are glial cells in the brain that make estrogen and produce cytokines and immune proteins in response to estrogen. These cells play a large role in neuroinflammation which can in turn lead to disorders such as Multiple Sclerosis, Alzheimer's disease, and Parkinson's disease. Estrogen can play an anti-inflammatory role with microglia, which can protect the CNS against the stimuli that promote such diseases.\n\nEndorphins modify core body temperature and trigger mechanisms which allow the body to reduce heat such as sweating and sending blood closer to the body's surface where the blood can be cooled. Postmenopausal symptoms such as hot flushes and night sweats initiated by the fluctuation in endorphins, may cause stress, leading to negativity, depression, and anxiety, which in turn can lead to cognitive decline.\n\nAt the cellular level, oestrogen binds to nuclear receptors, such as oestrogen receptors ER α/β, and acts as a transcription factor. It increases the production of anti-apoptotic proteins and prevents the initiation of apoptosis. It also activates antioxidants which work as defenses reducing negative factors such as glutathione levels and oxidative DNA damage in mitochondria. This programmed cell death and other damage of mitochondria has long been found as a key mechanism in Alzheimer's.\n\nThe decline in estrogens during menopause, which in turn produces a decrease in glucose, is shown in the prefontal cortex as well as the posterior cingulate. Alzheimer's patients have been shown to have abnormal glucose metabolism in these areas, also adding to the conclusion that estrogen has a direct relation to the development of Alzheimer's.\n\nHormone therapy also known as estrogen therapy is the most common treatment for menopausal symptoms.\n\nEstrogen has direct effects on the hippocampus, which in turn relates to mood, including increasing dendritic spine density and increasing the volume and neurogenesis of the hipposcampus; these are key to greater cognition as key neuronal circuits are maintained. Pharmaceutical companies are currently developing estrogen receptor ligands as anti-inflammatory agents to reduce neuroinflammation of microglia which leads to neurodegenerative disorders. However, other cellular targets may overtake the focus of the estrogen treatment as estrogen works as an anti-apoptotic hormone for neurons, induces growth of neural stem cells, increases astroglial cells ability to secrete neuroprotective molecules while also reducing their formation of neurotoxins, and reduces adhesion to endothelial cells.\n\nThe most common treatment is hormone replacement therapy or estrogen therapy. Women using hormone therapy for at least two years have increased blood flow to the hippocampus and temporal lobe as compared to those who did not undergo therapy. These areas of the brain are key to memory. Also, women who do not undergo therapy have been found to have less metabolic activity in the posterior cingulate cortex, while those with estrogen therapy did not show a significant metabolic change. This is important as declines in cerebral metabolism occur in the early stages of Alzheimer's, as mentioned in \"Causes\". Women who had their uterus and ovaries removed for medical reasons and lost their gonadal hormones showed a decrease in short-term verbal (hippocampus) and working memories (pre-frontal cortex), yet with estrogen therapy the memory loss was prevented. Furthermore, those who have undertaken estrogen therapy have shown significantly higher scores on verbal memory, verbal fluency, and visual memory tasks as compared to those who did not undergo treatment. It is widely found that this treatment must be administered near to the onset of menopause as opposed to several years postmenopause, when hormone therapy can have detrimental effects on cognition.\n\nResearch is inconclusive as to the true effects of estrogen on hippocampal volume as studies show results differing from improved cognition and maintained hippocampal volume when hormone therapy is administered during menopause to results showing no obvious beneficial results.\n\nResearch on menopause as a whole declined with the end of the Women's Health Initiative (WHI) studies, but research on the treatment of symptoms associated with menopause—especially the treatment of cognitive decline—continues. New research refutes the WHI findings that estrogen therapy (ET) is not a useful treatment for menopausal symptoms. This is especially shown in Alzheimer's research as the Women's Health Initiative Memory Study refuted the argument that a decline in oestrogens and progestogens seen during menopause increases vulnerability to neurodegenerative diseases. Mice are the main subject for research involving the effects of estrogen on brain health, cognition, and neurodegenerative disorders, and research in this area continues.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "307408", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=307408", "title": "Primary and secondary gain", "text": "Primary and secondary gain\n\nPrimary morbid gain or secondary morbid gain are used in medicine to describe the significant subconscious psychological motivators patients may have when presenting with symptoms. It is important to note that if these motivators are recognized by the patient, and especially if symptoms are fabricated or exaggerated for personal gain, then this is instead considered malingering.\n\nPrimary morbid gain produces positive internal motivations. For example, a patient might feel guilty about being unable to perform some task. If a medical condition justifying an inability is present, it may lead to decreased psychological stress. Primary gain can be a component of any disease, but is most typically demonstrated in conversion disorder – a psychiatric disorder in which stressors manifest themselves as physical symptoms without organic causes, such as a person who becomes blindly inactive after seeing a murder. The \"gain\" may not be particularly evident to an outside observer.\n\nSecondary morbid gain can also be a component of any disease, but is an external motivator. If a patient's disease allows him/her to miss work, avoid military duty, obtain financial compensation, obtain drugs, or avoid a jail sentence, these would be examples of a secondary gain. An example would be an individual having stomach cramps when household chores are completed by a family. In the context of a person with a significant mental or psychiatric disability, this effect is sometimes called secondary handicap.\n\nTertiary morbid gain, a less well-studied process, is when a third party such as a relative or friend is motivated to gain sympathy or other benefits from the illness of the victim.\n\n"}
{"id": "47789", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=47789", "title": "Quality of life", "text": "Quality of life\n\nQuality of life (QOL) is the general well-being of individuals and societies, outlining negative and positive features of life. It observes life satisfaction, including everything from physical health, family, education, employment, wealth, safety, security to freedom, religious beliefs, and the environment. QOL has a wide range of contexts, including the fields of international development, healthcare, politics and employment. It is important not to mix up the concept of QOL with a more recent growing area of health related QOL (HRQOL). An assessment of HRQOL is effectively an evaluation of QOL and its relationship with health.\n\nQuality of life should not be confused with the concept of standard of living, which is based primarily on income.\n\nStandard indicators of the quality of life include not only wealth and employment but also the built environment, physical and mental health, education, recreation and leisure time, and social belonging. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), quality of life is defined as “the individual’s perception of their position in life in the context of the culture and value systems in which they live and in relation to their goals.” In comparison to WHO's definitions, the Wang-Baker Faces scale defines quality of life as “life quality (in this case, physical pain) at a precise moment in time.”\n\nAccording to ecological economist Robert Costanza:\nOne approach, called engaged theory, outlined in the journal of \"Applied Research in the Quality of Life\", posits four domains in assessing quality of life: ecology, economics, politics and culture. In the domain of culture, for example, it includes the following subdomains of quality of life:\n\n\nAlso frequently related are concepts such as freedom, human rights, and happiness. However, since happiness is subjective and difficult to measure, other measures are generally given priority. It has also been shown that happiness, as much as it can be measured, does not necessarily increase correspondingly with the comfort that results from increasing income. As a result, standard of living should not be taken to be a measure of happiness. Also sometimes considered related is the concept of human security, though the latter may be considered at a more basic level and for all people.\n\nUnlike \"per capita\" GDP or standard of living, both of which can be measured in financial terms, it is harder to make objective or long-term measurements of the quality of life experienced by nations or other groups of people. Researchers have begun in recent times to distinguish two aspects of personal well-being: \"Emotional well-being\", in which respondents are asked about the quality of their everyday emotional experiences—the frequency and intensity of their experiences of, for example, joy, stress, sadness, anger, and affection— and \"life evaluation\", in which respondents are asked to think about their life in general and evaluate it against a scale. Such and other systems and scales of measurement have been in use for some time. Research has attempted to examine the relationship between quality of life and productivity. There are many different methods of measuring quality of life in terms of health care, wealth and materialistic goods. However, it is much more difficult to measure meaningful expression of one's desires. One way to do so is to evaluate the scope of how individuals have fulfilled their own ideals. Quality of life can simply mean happiness, the subjective state of mind. By using that mentality, citizens of a developing country appreciate more since they are content with the basic necessities of health care, education and child protection.\n\nPerhaps the most commonly used international measure of development is the Human Development Index (HDI), which combines measures of life expectancy, education, and standard of living, in an attempt to quantify the options available to individuals within a given society. The HDI is used by the United Nations Development Programme in their Human Development Report.\n\nThe World Happiness Report is a landmark survey on the state of global happiness. It ranks 156 countries by their happiness levels, reflecting growing global interest in using happiness and substantial well-being as an indicator of the quality of human development. Its growing purpose has allowed governments, communities and organizations to use appropriate data to record happiness in order to enable policies to provide better lives. The reports review the state of happiness in the world today and show how the science of happiness explains personal and national variations in happiness. Also developed by the United Nations and published recently along with the HDI, this report combines both objective and subjective measures to rank countries by happiness, which is deemed as the ultimate outcome of a high quality of life. It uses surveys from Gallup, real GDP per capita, healthy life expectancy, having someone to count on, perceived freedom to make life choices, freedom from corruption, and generosity to derive the final score. Happiness is already recognised as an important concept in global public policy. The World Happiness Report indicates that some regions have in recent years been experiencing progressive inequality of happiness. Without life, there is no happiness to be realised.\n\nThe Physical Quality of Life Index (PQLI) is a measure developed by sociologist Morris David Morris in the 1970s, based on basic literacy, infant mortality, and life expectancy. Although not as complex as other measures, and now essentially replaced by the Human Development Index, the PQLI is notable for Morris's attempt to show a \"less fatalistic pessimistic picture\" by focusing on three areas where global quality of life was generally improving at the time and ignoring gross national product and other possible indicators that were not improving.\n\nThe Happy Planet Index, introduced in 2006, is unique among quality of life measures in that, in addition to standard determinants of well-being, it uses each country's ecological footprint as an indicator. As a result, European and North American nations do not dominate this measure. The 2012 list is instead topped by Costa Rica, Vietnam and Colombia.\n\nGallup researchers trying to find the world's happiest countries found Denmark to be at the top of the list. uSwitch publishes an annual quality of life index for European countries. France has topped the list for the last three years.\n\nA 2010 study by two Princeton University professors looked at 1,000 randomly selected U.S. residents over an extended period. It concludes that their \"life evaluations\" – that is, their considered evaluations of their life against a stated scale of one to ten – rise steadily with income. On the other hand, their reported quality of \"emotional daily experiences\" (their reported experiences of joy, affection, stress, sadness, or anger) levels off after a certain income level (approximately $75,000 per year); income above $75,000 does not lead to more experiences of happiness nor to further relief of unhappiness or stress. Below this income level, respondents reported decreasing happiness and increasing sadness and stress, implying the pain of life's misfortunes, including disease, divorce, and being alone, is exacerbated by poverty.\n\nGross national happiness and other subjective measures of happiness are being used by the governments of Bhutan and the United Kingdom. The World Happiness report, issued by Columbia University is a meta-analysis of happiness globally and provides an overview of countries and grassroots activists using GNH. The OECD issued a guide for the use of subjective well-being metrics in 2013. In the U.S., cities and communities are using a GNH metric at a grassroots level.\n\nThe Social Progress Index measures the extent to which countries provide for the social and environmental needs of their citizens. Fifty-two indicators in the areas of basic human needs, foundations of wellbeing, and opportunity show the relative performance of nations. The index uses outcome measures when there is sufficient data available or the closest possible proxies.\n\nDay-Reconstruction Method was another way of measuring happiness, in which researchers asked their subjects to recall various things they did on the previous day and describe their mood during each activity. Being simple and approachable, this method required memory and the experiments have confirmed that the answers that people give are similar to those who repeatedly recalled each subject. The method eventually declined as it called for more effort and thoughtful responses, which often included interpretations and outcomes that do not occur to people who are asked to record every action in their daily lives.\n\nThe term \"quality of life\" is also used by politicians and economists to measure the livability of a given city or nation. Two widely known measures of livability are the Economist Intelligence Unit's Where-to-be-born Index and Mercer's Quality of Living Reports. These two measures calculate the livability of countries and cities around the world, respectively, through a combination of subjective life-satisfaction surveys and objective determinants of quality of life such as divorce rates, safety, and infrastructure. Such measures relate more broadly to the population of a city, state, or country, not to individual quality of life. Livability has a long history and tradition in urban design, and neighborhoods design standards such as LEED-ND are often used in an attempt to influence livability.\n\nSome crimes against property (e.g., graffiti and vandalism) and some \"victimless crimes\" have been referred to as \"quality-of-life crimes.\" American sociologist James Q. Wilson encapsulated this argument as the broken windows theory, which asserts that relatively minor problems left unattended (such as litter, graffiti, or public urination by homeless individuals) send a subliminal message that disorder in general is being tolerated, and as a result, more serious crimes will end up being committed (the analogy being that a broken window left broken shows an image of general dilapidation).\n\nWilson's theories have been used to justify the implementation of zero tolerance policies by many prominent American mayors, most notably Oscar Goodman in Las Vegas, Richard Riordan in Los Angeles, Rudolph Giuliani in New York City and Gavin Newsom in San Francisco. Such policies refuse to tolerate even minor crimes; proponents argue that this will improve the quality of life of local residents. However, critics of zero tolerance policies believe that such policies neglect investigation on a case-by-case basis and may lead to unreasonably harsh penalties for crimes.\n\nThe popsicle index is a quality-of-life measurement coined by Catherine Austin Fitts as the percentage of people in a community who believe that a child in their community can leave their home alone, go to the nearest possible location to buy a popsicle or other snack, and return home safely.\n\nWithin the field of healthcare, quality of life is often regarded in terms of how a certain ailment affects a patient on an individual level. This may be a debilitating weakness that is not life-threatening; life-threatening illness that is not terminal; terminal illness; the predictable, natural decline in the health of an elder; an unforeseen mental/physical decline of a loved one; or chronic, end-stage disease processes. Researchers at the University of Toronto's Quality of Life Research Unit define quality of life as \"The degree to which a person enjoys the important possibilities of his or her life\" (UofT). Their Quality of Life Model is based on the categories \"being\", \"belonging\", and \"becoming\"; respectively who one is, how one is not connected to one's environment, and whether one achieves one's personal goals, hopes, and aspirations.\n\nExperience sampling studies show substantial between-person variability in within-person associations between somatic symptoms and quality of life. Hecht and Shiel measure quality of life as “the patient’s ability to enjoy normal life activities” since life quality is strongly related to wellbeing without suffering from sickness and treatment. There are multiple assessments available that measure Health-Related Quality of Life, e.g., AQoL-8D, EQ5D - Euroqol, 15D, SF-36, SF-6D, HUI.\n\nQuality of life is an important concept in the field of international development since it allows development to be analyzed on a measure broader than standard of living. Within development theory, however, there are varying ideas concerning what constitutes desirable change for a particular society, and the different ways that quality of life is defined by institutions therefore shapes how these organizations work for its improvement as a whole.\n\nOrganisations such as the World Bank, for example, declare a goal of \"working for a world free of poverty\", with poverty defined as a lack of basic human needs, such as food, water, shelter, freedom, access to education, healthcare, or employment. In other words, poverty is defined as a low quality of life. Using this definition, the World Bank works towards improving quality of life through the stated goal of lowering poverty and helping people afford a better quality of life.\n\nOther organizations, however, may also work towards improved global quality of life using a slightly different definition and substantially different methods. Many NGOs do not focus at all on reducing poverty on a national or international scale, but rather attempt to improve quality of life for individuals or communities. One example would be sponsorship programs that provide material aid for specific individuals. Although many organizations of this type may still talk about fighting poverty, the methods are significantly different.\n\nImproving quality of life involves action not only by NGOs but also by governments. Global health has the potential to achieve greater political presence if governments were to incorporate aspects of human security into foreign policy. Stressing individuals’ basic rights to health, food, shelter, and freedom addresses prominent inter-sectoral problems negatively impacting today's society and may lead to greater action and resources. Integration of global health concerns into foreign policy may be hampered by approaches that are shaped by the overarching roles of defense and diplomacy.\n\n\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "3870254", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=3870254", "title": "Royal touch", "text": "Royal touch\n\nThe royal touch (also known as the king's touch) was a form of laying on of hands, whereby French and English monarchs touched their subjects, regardless of social classes, with the intent to cure them of various diseases and conditions. The thaumaturgic touch was most commonly applied to people suffering from tuberculous cervical lymphadenitis (better known as scrofula or the King's Evil), and exclusively to them from the 16th century onwards. The disease rarely resulted in death and often went into remission on its own, giving the impression that the monarch's touch cured it. The claimed power was most notably exercised by monarchs who sought to demonstrate the legitimacy of their reign and of their newly founded dynasties.\n\nThe kings and queens regnant of England and the kings of France were the only Christian rulers who claimed the divine gift (\"divinitus\") to cure by touching or stroking the diseased. This special aptitude was thought to be evidence of God's high esteem of the two monarchies, though they never agreed upon whose predecessors the ability was first conferred. In England, Saint Edward the Confessor (r. 1042–1066) was said to be the first monarch to possess the healing power of the royal touch. The French, who normally traced the origins of their monarchs' divine gift back to Philip I (r. 1059–1108) or even Robert II (r. 987–1031), denied that Saint Edward used the royal touch. They insisted that the first English monarch to claim the ability was Henry I (r. 1100–1135), and that his touching was a politically influenced imitation of the gift granted exclusively to French monarchs.\n\nThe physician André du Laurens (1558–1609) claimed that Clovis I (r. 481–511) was the first king who touched for scrofula, but the medievalist Marc Bloch (1886–1944) argued that it was probably Philip I. Modern scholars, most notably Frank Barlow (1911–2009), agree that the French practice most likely originated from Saint Louis IX (r. 1226–1270). The earliest direct evidence of the royal touch in England are the financial records dating from the reign of Edward I (r. 1272–1307). The crusading Edward I did not arrive in England until 1274 but the custom of giving one penny to each patient had become well established by 1276, suggesting that the practice dated at least from the reign of his father, Henry III (r. 1216–1272). Henry III, known for insisting on his arbitrary decisions, loved public displays and was as pious as his beloved brother-in-law, Saint Louis IX, all of which makes it likely that he introduced the practice in England.\n\nHenry I's successors did not consider the royal touch fundamental, reducing its application. The ritual remained a marginal aspect of kingship until the 17th century, when its appeal grew to unprecedented proportions and when it suddenly became an object of scrutiny in literature.\n\nSince the reign of Edward IV (r. 1461–1470, 1471–1483), monarchs presented the diseased with a gold coin known as an Angel and hung it around the subject's neck. The reverse of the coin depicted a ship, while the obverse showed the archangel Michael slaying a dragon, which led to the coin being popularly referred to as an Angel. Angels were currency, valued at 6s-8d when introduced, but when used as a Touch piece they were pierced for hanging round the neck. The diseased were instructed to wear the coin constantly to ensure the success of the treatment. Not all people embraced the notion of the royal touch and miraculous cures; many were simply eager to obtain the valuable gold coin. When the Angel went out of production in 1634, a small gold medal was struck for royal touching.\n\nHenry VII (r. 1485–1509), the first Tudor on the English throne, was preoccupied with legitimizing his reign. It was he who firmly established the procedure, relying heavily on precedent set by his predecessors. It consisted of four distinct elements:\n\nThe touch was originally meant to cure tuberculous cervical lymphadenitis (commonly referred to as scrofula or the King's Evil), rheumatism, convulsions, fevers, blindness, goitre and other ailments. Since the reign of Elizabeth I (r. 1558–1603), however, the touch was applied only to people suffering from scrofula. The Henrician practice was rarely modified, and the changes were minor; Elizabeth I made the sign of the cross above the infected person's head, while her squeamish successor, James I (r. 1603–1625), made stroking motions above the abscesses instead of actually touching them.\n\nThe ritual was normally performed between Michaelmas and Easter, when cold weather made it less likely to contract a disease from the infected subject. It was believed that the treatment was more likely to be successful if performed on a holy day. English monarchs generally touched less frequently than their French counterparts. Edward I touched up to 1,736 people annually, but did not touch during his frequent military campaigns abroad. His immediate successors followed a similar pattern.\n\nHenry VII touched seven or eight infected people annually, and there were intervals lasting several years during which he did not perform the ritual at all. Henry VIII (r. 1509–1547) touched 59 people between early January 1530 and late December 1532. The Protestant Edward VI (r. 1547–1553) apparently did not perform the ritual, but the Catholic Mary I (r. 1553–1558) took it somewhat more seriously. Early in her reign, the Protestant Elizabeth I was reluctant to participate in a ritual whose efficacy she probably doubted. Although she resumed the practice in 1570, after the Roman Catholic Church excommunicated her and alleged that she had lost her healing power, Elizabeth decisively downplayed her own role in the miraculous healing. The Elizabethan surgeon William Clowes, who asserted that the royal touch proved her legitimacy, claimed that Elizabeth could also heal foreigners, citing a Dutchman as an example.\n\nAlthough the strictly Protestant James I wished to end the practice, he found himself having to touch an increasing number of people. The practice spread to Scotland, where James reigned as well as resided before the Union of the Crowns; the Scots started believing that their king, now also king of England, possessed the ability to heal them. Charles I (r. 1625–1649) issued plenty of edicts in an attempt to restrain the growing public demand. On 27 December 1633, he touched 100 people at Holyrood Palace.\n\nThe frequency of the ritual reached its climax during the reign of Charles II (r. 1660–1685), the only English monarch who applied royal touch more than French kings. Over 92,000 scrofulous people were touched by him – over 4,500 annually. James II (r. 1685–1688) was very skeptical about the ritual but nevertheless indulged in it. He was deposed by William III (r. 1689–1702) and Mary II (r. 1689–1694), who refused to take part in what they considered a superstition. When a subject asked him for a touch, William reputedly said: \"God grant you better health and better sense.\" Anne (r. 1702–1714) reintroduced the practice almost as soon as she ascended, touching 30 people on 6 October and 20 on 19 December 1702. She took it very seriously, even fasting the day before. On 30 March 1712, she performed the ritual for the last time; Samuel Johnson (1709–1784) was the last of the 300 scrofulous people Anne touched that day. George I (r. 1714–1727) permanently discontinued the practice, but the exiled James II's Jacobite heirs claimed the ability until the 1780s.\n\nThe physician Sir Richard Blackmore praised William III and George I for abandoning \"that superstitious and insignificant ceremony\", which he believed was a \"Popish\" plot. The Glorious Revolution and subsequent abandonment of the idea of the divine right of kings rendered the royal touch unnecessary as means of proving monarch's legitimacy. Reports of Jacobite claimants curing scrofula by touch were rebuffed by a contributor to the \"General Evening Post\": \"The illustrious Royal Family now on the Throne despise such childish Delusions, such little pious Frauds, to prove their Divine Right to the Crown. They act upon noble Principles; they want no chicanery to support their Throne.\" The ceremony finally disappeared from the Book of Common Prayer in 1732.\n\nBy the Late Middle Ages, the royal touch had become an integral part of the coronation of the French monarch at Reims Cathedral. The rite included the anointing of the king's hands, which was believed to confer on him the ability to cure. The coronation and anointing were immediately followed by a journey to Corbeny, the site of the shrine of Saint Marcouf (d. 558), patron saint of scrofulous people. After the pilgrimage was completed, the newly crowned king was deemed to possess the sacred power of touch. On his deathbed, Philip IV (r. 1285–1314) reportedly instructed his son and heir, Louis X (r. 1314–1316), about healing scrofula by touch. Philip VI (r. 1328–1350), the first Valois king, sought to demonstrate that he shared the thaumaturgic powers of his sovereign cousins and ancestors, thus proving himself as their rightful heir. He touched 35 people between 1 January and 30 June 1337; some of them had come from Brittany, Brabant and Vivarais.\n\nThe demonologist Pierre de Lancre (1553–1631) boasted that even dead French monarchs could heal; it was, indeed, still believed in the 16th century that the healing power was retained by Saint Louis IX's arm, preserved in Poblet Monastery in Catalonia. In order to be touched by the French king, people traveled from as far off as the present-day Italy and Spain already in the 13th century. The foreigners were ranked in a specific order, with the Spanish taking precedence over all others and the king's own subjects coming last.\n\nThe idea of the royal touch promoted the power of the monarchy, but the ceremony was seldom performed in the 16th century. During the French Wars of Religion (1562–1598), the worsening conditions helped scrofula spread more than ever and the interest in the disease steadily increased. The Catholic League started a propaganda claiming that Henry III (r. 1574–1589) was unable to heal by touch due to his immorality. After the assassination of Henry III and accession of the Protestant Henry IV (r. 1589–1610), the League warned that God would revoke his gift if the French accepted a Protestant as their sovereign and that the scrofulous would never be cured again.\n\nAfter converting to Catholicism and establishing his authority, Henry IV was hailed not only as the healer of the scrofulous, but also as the healer of the kingdom. The first Bourbon on the French throne, he decided to take advantage of the ability attributed to his predecessors and use it to confirm the legitimacy of his reign. He was, however, in an inconvenient situation: he was crowned at Chartres Cathedral rather than Reims, and thus made no visit to the shrine of Saint Marcouf. He maintained that the royal touch was something he was handed down by his predecessors and by God's grace, rather than an ability conferred by the rite of coronation. Henry decided not to exhibit his \"divine gift\" immediately after his coronation at Chartres in February 1594; instead, he decided to save the mystique element of his kingship for his entry in Paris in March. Two weeks after the event, on Easter, Henry exercised his healing power for the first time. He was determined not to show any skepticism about the ritual, fearing that it might cast doubt on the sincerity of his conversion.\nHenry IV's decision to indulge in the practice served as visual evidence to his subjects that God approved of his reign. Royal physicians and others who witnessed these ceremonies insisted that at least half of all the diseased people he touched were healed within days. The ceremonies took place in other cities and at least four times a year: on Easter, on Pentecost, on All Saints Day and on Christmas. On Easter 1608, Henry IV touched 1,250 scrofulous persons. He complained that the hours-long ceremony exhausted him, but continued the practice and consistently gave the impression that he was doing it only out of concern for the well-being of his subjects. The ceremony was performed in the presence of the princes of the blood, almoners, bodyguards, and physicians. The latter presented Henry with patients, and he proceeded to make the sign of the cross on his scrofulous subject's cheeks, touched the subject's sores, and exclaimed: \"The King touches you, God cures you.\" ()\n\nLouis XIII (r. 1610–1643) and Louis XIV (r. 1643–1715) both actively took part in touching ceremonies. The latter touched 1,600 people on Easter 1680. Voltaire (1694–1778) scornfully wrote that he had lost confidence in the royal touch upon hearing that a mistress of Louis XIV died of scrofula \"despite being very well touched by the king\". After 1722, the sentence exclaimed by the king upon touching the infected changed to the more hopeful: \"The King touches you, may God heal you.\" () The new formula, rather than implying that God would inevitably grant the monarch's wish, was a prayer that may or may not result in a cure. Louis XV (r. 1715–1774) was skeptical about the royal touch. He performed it early in his reign, but caused a scandal when he failed to summon the scrofulous at Eastertide in 1739 and never again touched the diseased. The custom was thus suspended for 36 years, until Louis XVI (r. 1774–1792) revived it at his coronation on 11 June 1775 by touching 2,400 people. That was probably the only time he touched the scrofulous. At his coronation on 29 May 1825, Charles X (r. 1824–1830) touched 121 of his subjects; the royal touch was never again employed.\n\nThe royal touch was not the only \"miraculous\" healing power attributed to European rulers. Members of the House of Habsburg were believed to be able to cure stuttering by a mouth-kiss. The medieval monarchs of Castile were reputed to possess the ability to exorcise demons by making the sign of the cross and calling on God, while their Hungarian counterparts supposedly cured jaundice. Similarly, English monarchs distributed cramp-rings, which were said to be a cure for \"diabolical\" sicknesses such as cramps and epilepsy.\n\nInoculation, an early form of immunization, was introduced into England during the reign of George I, who had put a definite end to the royal touch in his kingdom. The royal family strongly supported it, but it was controversial medically as well as politically and theologically. The medicine historian Adrian Wilson described it as \"the Whig and Hanoverian equivalent of the Stuart practice of touching for scrofula ... But whereas the Royal Touch mobilised divine powers, based on hereditary right, inoculation deployed natural powers harnessed by man, with the monarch as the benevolent onlooker rather than indispensable participant.\"\n\nScholars have held different opinions about the royal touch, ranging from deprecation in the 19th and early 20th century to more sympathetic treatment. The Whig politician Lord Macaulay (1800–1859) ridiculed it as an \"absurd superstition of a pre-enlightened age\". The University of London medicine professor Sir Raymund Crawfurd published a study in 1911, revealing his fascination with the \"dubious if exotic\" practice. A study by the French historian Marc Bloch followed in 1924. Bloch was baffled by the tenacity of the esoteric practice and agreed with Lord Macaulay's assessment that it was grounded in a form of mass hysteria. Recently, however, historians have avoided attributing the popularity of the royal touch to naivety of the masses. The British historian Keith Thomas discussed the royal touch in the context of religion and magic, while his colleague and compatriot J. C. D. Clark attributes the survival of the practice into the 18th century to the persisting notion of the divine right of kings.\n\n\n"}

A student will generally select an elective \"sub\"-internship, where the student will perform the role of an intern or first year medical graduate, under the supervision of senior house staff and attending physicians. The rotation is generally pursued in the field appropriate to career interest. For example, a sub-I can be taken in Internal Medicine, Surgery, Pediatrics, or Obstetrics and Gynecology. In this way, the student can experience a glimpse of their future career without the burden of full responsibility. Additionally, many medical students select sub-internships at institutions where they wish to apply for residency; such rotations are \"auditions\" for the student to demonstrate his or her commitment to the outside program.\n\nAt the turn of the 21st century ninety-eight percent of US medical schools offered an internal medicine sub-I a.k.a.

In general the following responsibilities are given to a sub-I student: accept and give sign-out of all patients on the team, assess assigned patients before morning rounds, write problem oriented notes daily on all patients, admit patients on call days, act as information liaison between the medical team and hospital staff, communicating plan of care to patient.

Several institutions have experimented with the use of subsurface dykes to conserve water in water-scarce areas. The ideal location for a dyke is a well defined, wide, greatly sloping valley with a narrow outlet having limited thickness of loose soil or porous rock on the top with massive or impervious rock below. A subsurface dyke has many advantages. It does not require additional surface reservoir, there is no loss of agricultural land, there is minimum evaporation loss since the storage is subsurface, there is no siltation and loss of reservoir capacity, the cost of maintenance is negligible, and it is relatively environment-friendly.\n\nOne such example was a recent sub-surface dyke constructed in India.

Medical care providers can set their own fees that are higher than the Medicare reimbursement fee, but the patient must pay all the cost of care, not just the excess.\n\nAbout 70% of Canada's healthcare funding is via the public system. Another 30% comes from private funding, divided approximately equally between out-of-pocket funding and private insurance, which may be complementary (meeting costs not covered by the public system such as the cost of prescription medicines, dental treatments and copayments) or supplementary (adding more choice of provider or providing faster access to care) There are, however, financial disincentives that make private medicine for services that are covered by Medicare less economic.\n\nSix of Canada's ten provinces used to ban private insurance for publicly insured services to inhibit queue jumping and so preserve fairness in the health care system. In 2005, the Supreme Court of Canada ruled that in Quebec, such bans are unconstitutional if the waiting period for care is excessively long. However, this ruling only applies within the Province of Quebec. A second court challenge is currently underway to determine whether the prohibition of private parallel health care violates the patients' right to life, liberty, and security under Section 7 of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms. \n\nSome private hospitals operating while the national healthcare plan was instituted (for example, the Shouldice Hernia Centre in Thornhill, Ontario) continue to operate, but they may not bill additional charges for medical procedures. (The Shouldice Hospital, however, has mandatory additional room charges not covered by public health insurance. That effectively places it in the \"upper tier\" of a two-tier system. Welfare recipients, for example, cannot be referred there.)\n\nClinics are usually private operations but may not bill additional charges. Private healthcare may also be supplied, both in uncovered fields and to foreigners.\n\nHealthcare in Denmark, although primarily subsidised by the government at the county and the national levels health, is supported by complementary insurance plans to cover elective services not covered by the public system; they also help cover copayments.\n\nHealthcare in France is a system of private and public physicians, who largely draw their income from the government. There are public as well as private hospitals.\n\nPatients pay a small copayment for certain aspects of care, but many people choose to cover the costs by taking out supplemental health insurance for which a small premium is payable each year.\n\nThus, France also has a mixed delivery system with complete patient freedom of supplier choice. There is a two-tier funding arrangement, with compulsory funding of core medical services from taxation, with optional private insurance for the cost of copayments.\n\nHealthcare in Germany has multiple sickness funds, either publicly owned or not-for-profit mutuals. Membership of a sickness fund is compulsory for everyone except certain people earning an income above a certain level, who opt out of the insurance system altogether. Doctors are usually self-employed, and hospitals may be publicly owned, privately owned or not for profit.\n\nHealthcare in the Republic of Ireland is financed mainly by the state. However, all citizens have the option of buying additional private health insurance, provided by four companies. They include VHI, a large publicly owned insurer, operating, like all other insurers, community rating; people are insured at the same basic rate regardless of health status. The other insurers are Glo Healthcare, LAYA and Avivia. Also, much smaller restricted membership companies provide benefits for certain professions, such as police officers.\n\nThere are public as well as private hospitals. Private patients are often treated in public hospitals, as all privately insured patients have an entitlement to use the publicly funded system.\n\nHealthcare in the Netherlands is essentially single tier, with all persons accessing a common system of private and public providers with complete freedom of choice between providers. Insurers are all private companies. It is heavily subsidized from tax revenues and heavily regulated, with a common, regulated standard insurance policy coverage set nationwide for all providers and a more flexible top up insurance, which is less regulated and set by each company as it chooses.\n\nInsurers set a standard price for each adult for the year throughout the country and must insure all people who apply for insurance at that price regardless of the age or health status of the applicant. An equalization fund, which is essentially a national sickness fund funded from a form of income tax on employers and employees, is used to pay for the health care of all children and to compensate insurers if they have more high risk profile clients than the other insurers.\n\nThus, Dutch insurers welcome the sick and the elderly because they are fully compensated for the higher-risk profile of these clients. People living in more expensive areas of the country have to pay higher premiums, since they get less compensation from the government because they can afford to pay more but the elderly and the sick pay the same premiums as everyone else in that region. Social insurance covers the insurance costs of those with limited incomes, such as the unemployed and the permanently disabled.\n\nHealthcare in Singapore uses a true two-tier system for both the provider network and the insurance funds. A government-sponsored and subsidized system of hospitals accepts all patients, with a guaranteed list of services. A parallel system of private hospitals provides services not available in public hospitals or available with extra amenities (such as private rooms and other boutique services).\n\nSingapore uses a universal insurance fund in which all citizens are required to participate, as a baseline. Seniors and certain groups are subsidised in their membership in the universal basic insurance fund.\n\nOptional additional supplementary insurance funds are available for purchase for elective coverage, such as for plastic surgery or for extra amenities in hospital.\n\nPrivate insurance, private hospitals and private management of public hospitals exist in Spain, and coexist with hospitals completely run by the government. Public insurance guarantees universal coverage, with no expenditure from patients other than a fraction of prescription drug cost. Some private hospitals are only accessible with private insurance. The system is regularly ranked amongst the world's best \n\nPrivate health insurance is compulsory for all persons residing in Switzerland. Insurance companies are required to sell the compulsory basic health insurance at cost, and individuals who cannot afford the premium (based on a premium-to-income ratio) are provided with public cash subsidies. Public hospitals are subsidised, but there are also private hospitals that provide additional services, such as elective services.\n\nIn addition to the compulsory basic health insurance, optional complementary and supplementary private insurance plans are available for purchase.\n\nThe National Health Service (or NHS) provides universal coverage to all residents of the United Kingdom.\n\nPrivate healthcare has continued parallel to the NHS, paid for largely by private insurance, and is used by about 8% of the population, generally as an add-on to NHS services and mostly obtained by employer funded insurance schemes. That is a taxable benefit to the employee, the value imputed by the tax authorities as income to the beneficiary. Because NHS services are so comprehensive, there are many areas in which the private sector usually does not compete and private insurers almost always refuse to fund. Childbirth and perinatal services are good examples.\n\nConversely, there are some areas where the NHS does not offer free treatment (cosmetic surgery for vanity purposes, for example) and so the private sector offers a pay-for-service alternative.\n\nHistorically, avoiding waiting lists was the main reason that patients opted out of NHS treatment and into private care. Queues of many months are common. NHS Consultants, who can run both NHS and private services during their NHS contracts, used to be in charge of waiting lists and had a financial incentive to keep the public waiting list long, to ensure a stream of private income to the private business.\n\nSince the Blair government reforms of the NHS, strict rules apply to waiting lists (see hospital choice in the NHS). That and the allocation of better funding in hospitals both reduced waiting times significantly. Most hospital patients are in fact not admitted from a list at all, and those that do, on average, wait less than 9 weeks. Nobody should wait more than 18 weeks. The 18 weeks is not dead time because it includes the time taken to book a first appointment, to conduct all the tests, for the doctor and patient to agree on the desired treatment, and to book and execute an operation or commence the treatment regime. A patient not seen in the 18-week period without just cause has the legal right to go private at the NHS's expense.\n\nAs a result of these improvements, long waiting times reduced, and the private healthcare sector now sells its surplus capacity to the NHS. Dentistry is an area where many practitioners prefer to work privately (because they can set their own fees). NHS dentistry can then be patchy, and some people may find that private dentistry is the only practical option open to them in their locality.\n\nThere has always been a degree of private medicine conducted within NHS hospitals, with private work being done in those hospitals and the patient being accommodated in segregated accommodation. Until recently, few NHS patients were ever treated in private hospitals. In the English NHS, however, there has been greater willingness to outsource some work to the private sector, and so some NHS patients do sometimes gain access to private health care facilities at public expense. The equivalent NHS operations in Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland do not often fund treatment outside of their own facilities.\n\nWhether the NHS funds treatment in a private hospital is a decision for the local commissioning health authority based on formal service contracts.\n\nThe United States has a two-tier health system, but most of the population cannot gain access to the public provision tiers. Healthcare provided directly by the government is limited to military and veteran families and to certain Native American tribes. Certain cities and towns also provide free care directly but only to those who cannot afford to pay. Medicare, Medicaid, and the State Children's Health Insurance Program pay for health care obtained at private facilities but only for the elderly, disabled, and children in poor families. Since enacting the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act in 2010, Medicaid has been substantially expanded, and federal subsidies are available for low- to middle-income individuals and families to purchase private health insurance.\n\nThe debate over healthcare reform in the United States has included a proposal for a public option or Medicare for all, a government-run insurance program, available to all US citizens, to compete with or replace private insurance plans.\n\n"}

The purpose of the technique is to recreate the natural transfer of bacteria that the baby gets during a vaginal birth. It involves placing swabs in the mother’s vagina, and then wiping them into the baby’s face, mouth, eyes and skin.\n\nInfants conceived vaginally are exposed to heaps of gainful microorganisms knows as microbiota when they travel down the birth cana The baby is exposed to the mother’s vaginal microbes that wash over the child in the bath canal, which coves the skin, and enters the baby’s eyes, ears, nose, and mouth. These microbes often travel down into the gut after being swallowed. It is said that these microbes are important in the postnatal development of the immune system of the baby. \nIn the event that a C-section is done before labour starts or before a woman’s water breaks, the infant won't come into contact with maternal vaginal fluid or bacteria. Instead, they come in contact with skin microbes, a very different set of species. These differences, in turn, have been associated with increased risks of asthma, allergies, obesity, and immune deficiencies. Thus, these differences appear more often in infants after a caesarean delivery that after a vaginal delivery, according to certain epidemiological data.\n\nThe purpose behind the practice of vaginal seeding or micro birthing is that it allows an infant delivered via caesarean section to come in contact with microbes from the birth canal. The expectation is that this may boost their gut bacteria and lessen the danger of health issues normally associated with caesarian infants. It contributes to the seeding of the infant gut.\n\nIt is unclear whether vaginal seeding has long term benefit or whether it is safe. In 2016 a small study was published in the Journal Nature Medicine to look into the benefits of vaginal seeding. However, the study authors acknowledged that the consequences of vaginal seeding remain unclear due to limited data. \n\nIn 2017, a subsequent study was published which found that there wasn’t a big difference, after six weeks, between the microbes of infants born vaginally versus those who received vaginal seeding. which further added to the confusion. Furthermore, certain scholars have pointed out that a baby's exposure to bacteria begins even before birth and more research is required on this matter.\n\nInfants conceived by C-section are really at lower danger of exchange of some conceivably harmful microbes and infections from the birth canal. However, with vaginal seeding, these harmful microorganisms and infections could be exchanged to the infant on a swab and potentially cause an infection. \n\nAn editorial written in the British Medical Journal is advising practitioners and parents to not perform vaginal seeding as there is not enough evidence that it is beneficial for infants and could potentially put babies health at risk.\nThe American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG) also does not encourage or recommend vaginal seeding due to lack of evidence.\n"}

Workers there were potentially exposed to the industrial solvent trichloroethylene (TCE), classified by the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) as a probable human carcinogen. At the factory, which closed in 2001, it had been estimated by ODHS that up to 25,000 workers may have been exposed to TCE via the factory's drinking water, which was drawn from a well on-site. However, further investigation showed that the actual number of employees who can be identified from employment records for the site is approximately half that number. In addition, the number of employees identified as having worked at the site for more than five years is likely to be less than 1,000. The site is now considered safe.\n\nThe View-Master, a device for viewing 3-D images (also known as stereo images) on a paper disk, was invented in 1939 by William Gruber, a Portland, Oregon, photographer. A business arrangement was made, and the devices came to be manufactured by Sawyer's, Inc. In 1951, Sawyer's opened a factory in Progress, Oregon (now part of Beaverton), to manufacture the devices. The devices were manufactured at the factory in Beaverton until 2001, when production was shifted elsewhere and portions of the factory sold.\n\nIn 1998, a prospective site developer hired an environmental engineering firm to perform an environmental assessment of the site. This assessment discovered volatile organic compounds well above the levels specified by the United States Environmental Protection Agency (U.S. EPA). This included levels of TCE which were over 300 times the federal drinking water standard. The various concerns who owned the View-Master franchise in the 1950s through the 1970s (Sawyer's and GAF), acknowledged using TCE to clean and de-grease parts and equipment, and disposed of the chemical on-site. This disposal was legal at the time.\n\nIARC has classified TCE as “probably carcinogenic to humans”. The U.S. EPA is in the process of evaluating the carcinogenic and non-carcinogenic human health risks from exposure to TCE.\n\nCertain uses of TCE were banned in 1977 in the United States. However, TCE was still used in household products such as spot removers and typewriter correction fluid well into the 1990s.\n\nThe ODHS has estimated that up to 25,000 workers may have been exposed to this chemical. However, based on employment records for the site, subsequent reports estimate the number at approximately 13,700. A more recent report which evaluated the completeness of the employment records concluded that the number of employees with over five years of employment is likely to be less than 1,000. According to a study performed by the ODHS, among former factory workers, the number of deaths from several types of cancer was elevated. However, for several other types of cancer, the number of deaths was lower than expected. ODHS concluded that there was no overall increase in cancer mortality among the workers, but that further study was warranted.\n\nBy September 2004, surface soil and surface water levels of TCE and other chemicals were within normal levels. As a result, the site has been deemed suitable for commercial re-use, and a shopping plaza was constructed. That plaza is now supplied by Portland's city water and does not use water from the former well.\n\nThe ODHS has recommended that the health of the workers at the former factory be evaluated to determine the extent to which this population may have been affected by potential exposure to TCE.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "3599795", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=3599795", "title": "White hunter", "text": "White hunter\n\nWhite hunter is a literary term used for professional big game hunters of European or North American backgrounds who plied their trade in Africa, especially during the first half of the 20th century. The activity continues in the dozen African countries which still permit big-game hunting. White hunters derived their income from organizing and leading safaris for paying clients, or from the sale of ivory.\n\nThe popular term Great White Hunter emphasizes the racial and colonial aspects of the profession, as well as its colorful aspects. Depending on the author and intention, the term can be used straightforwardly, in parody, or as a criticism.\n\nWhite men from Western countries had been hunting big game in Africa throughout the 19th century, particularly in the more settled southern portion of the continent. But the region most associated with the term \"white hunters\" is East Africa. By the start of the 20th century, as part of the \"scramble for Africa\", Great Britain and Germany had taken colonial possession of territories on the eastern half of the continent—territories now recognized as the nations of Kenya, Rwanda, Uganda, and Tanzania.\n\nThere were many factors that led to the spread of big-game hunting in East Africa, but two were foremost among them: first, a romantic European conception of hunting that combined aristocratic privilege and sportsmanship, and second, the desire by the colonizing powers to create new agricultural economies, to which unchecked animal populations posed a serious threat.\n\nAlthough the origins of the phrase cannot be confirmed, the first European to go by the title of \"white hunter\" is generally considered to have been Alan Black. Black was hired in the 1890s by Hugh Cholmondeley, 3rd Baron Delamere. Delamere employed both Alan Black and a native Somali hunter to lead safaris in Somaliland. As the story goes, in order to avoid confusion, the Somali was referred to as the \"black hunter\", and Black was called the \"white hunter\".\n\nAround the start of the 20th century, East African hunting safaris became a fashionable pursuit among members of the privileged classes, particularly in Britain and the United States. The completion of the Uganda Railway in 1901 provided easier access to the interior highlands of British East Africa (also known then as the East African Protectorate, and now as Kenya), where large game, especially elephants, lions, Cape buffalo, and rhinoceroses, was plentiful. The white hunter served these paying customers as guide, teacher, and protector.\n\nTypically, the hunter was hired or booked by an outfitting company (the first and most famous of these was Newland, Tarlton & Co. in Nairobi); the outfitter would make the local arrangements, gathering and packing supplies and hiring the many African workers without whom a safari was impossible. Porters, tent attendants, armed guards (known as \"askaris\"), horse-trainers, and gun-bearers, all worked under the supervision of a \"headman\". Before the mass importation of motor vehicles, most safaris traveled on foot and horseback and could employ anywhere from 50 to several hundred African workers.\n\nThe British colonial government also turned big-game hunting into a source of revenue, charging the tourists and hunters licensing fees for permission to kill the game animals. In 1909, a £50 hunting license in the East Africa Protectorate entitled its purchaser to kill 2 buffaloes, 2 hippos, 1 eland, 22 zebras, 6 oryxes, 4 waterbucks, 1 Greater Kudu, 4 Lesser Kudus, 10 topis, 26 hartebeests, 229 other antelope, 84 colobus monkeys, and unlimited lions and leopards. (lions and leopards killed livestock and were classified as vermin.)\n\nWhite hunters were colorful and romantic figures, often from privileged English backgrounds, who embraced a life of danger and adventure. The first acclaimed white hunters in East Africa were Alan Black, Bill Judd, Frederick Selous (remembered as the namesake of the Selous Scouts and whose real-life adventures inspired Sir H. Rider Haggard to create the fictional Allan Quatermain), and R.J. Cunninghame (sometimes spelled Cuningham), all of whom began their exploits at the end of the 19th century. In 1909 Cunninghame was selected to lead what was probably the best-publicized African safari, Theodore Roosevelt's excursion into British East Africa. Roosevelt's fame and popularity, and his gift for generating publicity, prompted a craze for safaris among those who could afford the sizeable price tag. After the First World War, when Germany's colonial lands in East Africa were ceded to Britain, eager customers poured into Africa, creating a market for the skills of several more decades of hunters.\n\nAmong the better-known white hunters who succeeded Cunninghame's generation were W.D.M. Bell, later known as \"Karamoja\" Bell; Bror von Blixen-Finecke, who was, between 1914 and 1926, married to \"Out of Africa\" author Karen Blixen; Denys Finch-Hatton, later her lover;Frederick Russell Burnham, Chief of Scouts in the Second Boer War to (Lord Roberts and known as \"England's American Scout\"; John A. Hunter; and Philip Percival and Frank M. \"Bunny\" Allen, whose safaris with Ernest Hemingway led the author to write \"Green Hills of Africa\", \"True at First Light\", \"The Short Happy Life of Francis Macomber\", and \"The Snows of Kilimanjaro\".\n\nThe exploits of white hunters were subjects first for novels and later for films. They were romanticized in adventure novels of the so-called \"Lost World/Lost Race\" genre.\n\n\"BY THE IMPERIAL noonday, then, the spectacle of the Empire was flamboyant indeed, coloured as much by Oriental despotism and barbaric gesture as by feudal example from nearer home. If it was modernist in some ways, it was antique in others. It embodied the marvellous energy of steam as well as the immemorial pride of horseflesh. It was queenly, but it was savage. It was partly the consequence of dukes, but partly the beat of jungle drums, and Imperial activists of every kind were recruited willy-nilly into its presentation: bishops beside viceroys, police officers and railwaymen, even sportsmen, foresters, jute merchants, river pilots or colonial accountants - all of whom, by their bearing, their demeanour or their costume, their pose at the wicket, the flutter of their gowns, the gravity of their presence behind the study desk or board-room table, contributed to the Imperial effect.\"\n\nPerhaps the first fictional Victorian adventure hero was Allan Quatermain, a white hunter who appeared in books by H. Rider Haggard, starting with \"King Solomon's Mines\" (1885). In 1924, Richard Connell published his short story \"The Most Dangerous Game\", in which an American big-game hunter finds himself being hunted by a Russian aristocrat who has tired of hunting in Africa; the story is still widely read. Alex Raymond created the \"Jungle Jim\" comic strip in 1934 that later lead to a comic book, film serial, film series, and television show. Geoffrey Household's novel \"Rogue Male\" (1939) featured a white hunter going after Adolf Hitler; it was filmed twice, first as \"Man Hunt\" (1941) and, a generation later, under the original title (1976). Captain CG Biggar, a supporting character in the P. G. Wodehouse comic novel \"Ring for Jeeves\" (1953), is another example of the white hunter.\n\nNot surprisingly, actual white hunters were often involved in the filming of the exploits of their fictional counterparts: Bunny Allen led many film companies on safari to enable location filming for \"King Solomon's Mines\", \"Mogambo\" (1953), and \"Nor the Moon by Night\" (1958). The white hunter on safari in his khakis and pith helmet became an instantly recognizable stock character.\n\nAbbott and Costello lampooned the type in \"Africa Screams\" (1949), which was a parody of a 1930 documentary, \"Africa Speaks!\" (1930). Bob Hope parodied the safari genre in \"Road to Zanzibar\" (1941) and \"Call Me Bwana\" (1963).\n\nHemingway's safari story, \"The Short Happy Life of Francis Macomber\" (1936), richly addresses the questions of courage, cowardice, racism, and power on safari. The story was made into a film titled \"The Macomber Affair\" (1947), but it was reissued in the United States under the title, \"The Great White Hunter\". The title character is an American tourist looking to find his own courage by facing danger on safari. In the story, Hemingway accurately refers to the professional hunter leading the safari, a character named Wilson, as a \"white hunter\". (Wilson is said to have been based on Hemingway's own guides, Philip Percival and Bror von Blixen-Finecke). The addition of \"great\" in the movie release title may have helped to lodge the ironic use of the phrase in the popular culture.\n\nClint Eastwood's film, \"White Hunter, Black Heart\" (1990) presents clear examples of this type, both in the professional hunters leading John Wilson in to the bush and in the director's passion to be such a hunter.\n\nThe phrase \"\"great\" white hunter\" probably has its origins in these popular depictions of safari adventures. Peter Capstick, a white hunter and an author of books on the subject, suggested that the word \"great\" may have been added by American popular culture. It was not a term employed or embraced by the hunters themselves. Its meaning, like many labels from the colonial era, is now shaded with parody or derision: it came to symbolize a perceived arrogance of western colonial powers toward the less developed parts of the world they controlled before the dismemberment of their empires after World War II.\n\n\n\n(new link seems to be: http://british-empire.livejournal.com/14357.html or http://silentmoviemonsters.tripod.com/TheLostWorld/LWIMPAD.html)\n"}
