{"id": "18469573", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=18469573", "title": "Asylum confinement of Christopher Smart", "text": "Asylum confinement of Christopher Smart\n\nThe English poet Christopher Smart (1722–1771) was confined to mental asylums from May 1757 until January 1763. Smart was admitted into St Luke's Hospital for Lunatics, Upper Moorfields, London, on 6 May 1757. He was taken there by his father-in-law, John Newbery, although he may have been confined in a private madhouse before then. While in St Luke's he wrote \"Jubilate Agno\" and \"A Song to David\", the poems considered to be his greatest works. Although many of his contemporaries agreed that Smart was \"mad\", accounts of his condition and its ramifications varied, and some felt that he had been committed unfairly.\n\nSmart was diagnosed as \"incurable\" while at St Luke's, and when they ran out of funds for his care he was moved to Mr. Potter's asylum, Bethnal Green. All that is known of his years of confinement is that he wrote poetry. Smart's isolation led him to abandon the poetic genres of the 18th century that had marked his earlier work and to write religious poetry such as \"Jubilate Agno\" (\"Rejoice in the Lamb\"). His asylum poetry reveals a desire for \"unmediated revelation\", and it is possible that the self-evaluation found in his poetry represents an expression of evangelical Christianity.\n\nLate 18th-century critics felt that Smart's madness justified them in ignoring his \"A Song to David\", but during the following century Robert Browning and his contemporaries considered his condition to be the source of his genius. It was not until the 20th century, with the rediscovery of \"Jubilate Agno\" (not published until 1939), that critics reconsidered Smart's case and began to see him as a revolutionary poet, the possible target of a plot by his father-in-law, a publisher, to silence him.\n\nSmart was confined to asylums during a time of debate about the nature of madness and its treatment. During the 18th century, madness was \"both held to reveal inner truth and condemned to silence and exclusion as something unintelligible by reason, and therefore threatening to society and to humanity\". It was commonly held to be an incurable affliction whose sufferers should be isolated from society. Physician William Battie—who later treated Smart—wrote:\n\n[we] find that Madness is, contrary to the opinion of some unthinking persons, as manageable as many other distempers, which are equally dreadful and obstinate, and yet are not looked upon as incurable, and that such unhappy objects ought by no means to be abandoned, much less shut up in loathsome prisons as criminals or nuisances to the society.\n\nIn particular, Battie defined madness as \"deluded imagination\". However, he was attacked by other physicians, such as John Monro, who worked at Bethlem Hospital. In his \"Remarks on Dr. Battie's Treatise on Madness\", Monro explained that those who were mad had the correct perceptions, but that they lacked the ability to judge properly. Although Monro promoted ideas of reform, his suggested treatment—beating patients—was as harsh on patients as Battie's preferred option, of completely isolating patients from society.\n\nIn 1758, Battie and others argued that those deemed \"mad\" were abused under the British asylum system, and they pushed for parliamentary action. Battie's \"Treatise on Madness\" emphasised the problems of treating the hospitals as tourist attractions and the punitive measures taken against patients. The arguments of Battie and others resulted in the passage of the Act for Regulating Private Madhouses (1774), but were too late to help Smart.\n\nModern critics, however, have a more cynical view of the 18th-century use of the term \"madness\" when diagnosing patients; psychiatrist Thomas Szasz viewed the idea of madness as arbitrary and unnatural. Agreeing with Szasz's position, philosopher Michel Foucault emphasised that asylums were used in the 18th century to attack dissenting views and that the idea of madness was a cultural fear held by the British public, rather than a legitimate medical condition. In particular, Foucault considered the 18th century a time of \"great confinement\". This description is consistent with Smart's 1760s writings on the subject in which, according to Thomas Keymer, \"the category of madness is insistently relativized, and made to seem little more than the invention of a society strategically concerned to discredit all utterances or conduct that threatens its interests and norms.\"\n\n18th century treatment of inpatients was simple: they were to be fed daily a light diet of bread, oatmeal, some meat or cheese, and a little amount of beer, which were inadequate in meeting daily nutritional needs; they were denied contact with outsiders, including family members; and they would be denied access to that which was deemed to be the cause of their madness (these causes ranged from alcohol and food to working outside). If their actions appeared \"afresh and without assignable cause\", then their condition would be labelled as \"original\" madness and deemed incurable. An institution like St Luke's, run by Battie, held both \"curable\" and \"incurable\" patients. There were few spots available for patients to receive free treatment, and many were released after a year to make room for new admittances.\n\nDuring the 1740s, Smart published many poems while a student at Pembroke College, Cambridge. He eventually left the university in 1749 to devote his time to poetry. In 1750, Smart started to familiarise himself with Grub Street, London's writing district, and met John Newbery, a publisher. Soon after, Newbery began publishing Smart's works in various magazines and in collections, including \"Poems on Several Occasions\" (1752). Of these works, Smart was known for his Seatonian Prize-winning poems, his pastoral poem \"The Hop-Garden\", and his mock epic \"The Hilliad\". In 1752, Smart married Newbery's daughter, Anna Maria Carnan, and had two daughters with her by 1754. Although many of Smart's works were published between 1753 and 1755, he had little money to provide for his family. At the end of 1755, he finished a translation of the works of Horace, but even that provided little income. Having no other choices, Smart signed a 99-year-long contract in November 1755 to produce a weekly paper entitled \"The Universal Visiter or Monthly Memorialist\", and the strain of writing caused Smart's health to deteriorate.\n\nOn 5 June 1756, Smart's father-in-law Newbery published, without permission, Smart's \"Hymn to the Supreme Being\", a poem which thanked God for recovery from an illness of some kind, possibly a \"disturbed mental state\". During the illness, Smart was possibly confined to Newbery's home and unable to write or be socially active. Out of sympathy for Smart, many of his friends, including writer and critic Samuel Johnson, began to write in the \"Universal Visiter\" to fulfill Smart's contractual obligation to produce content for the magazine. The publication of \"Hymn to the Supreme Being\" marked the beginning of Smart's obsession with religion and eventual confinement for madness because he began praying \"without ceasing\".\n\nSmart's behaviour was probably influenced by St Paul's command in the First Epistle to the Thessalonians to \"Pray without ceasing\" and William Law's \"The Spirit of Prayer\", which argues that a constant state of prayer will establish a connection with God. Smart began by praying at regular intervals but this slowly deteriorated into irregular praying in which he would interrupt his friends' activities and call them into the street to pray with him. These calls for public prayer continued until an incident that Smart later described in \"Jubilate Agno\": \"For I blessed God in St James's Park till I routed all the company... For the officers of the peace are at variance with me, and the watchman smites me with his staff\" (\"Jubilate Agno\" B 90–91).\n\nChristopher Hunter, Smart's biographer and nephew, described the situation:\n\nThough the fortune as well as the constitution of Mr. Smart required the utmost care, he was equally negligent in the management of both, and his various and repeated embarrassments acting upon an imagination uncommonly fervid, produced temporary alienations of mind; which at last were attended with paroxysms so violent and continued as to render confinement necessary.\n\nHunter reports that Samuel Johnson visited Smart during the latter's confinement, and it was Johnson that, \"on the first approaches of Mr Smart's malady, wrote several papers for a periodical publication in which that gentleman was concerned.\" However, at no time did Smart ever believe himself to be insane; these meetings began before Smart was ever put into asylum because he still contributed, although not as significantly, to the \"Universal Visiter\". In joking about writing for the \"Universal Visiter\", Johnson claimed: \"for poor Smart, while he was mad, not then knowing the terms on which he was engaged to write ... I hoped his wits would return to him. Mine returned to me, and I wrote in 'the Universal Visitor' no longer.\"\n\nThere are other possibilities beyond madness or religious fervor that may have led to Smart's confinement: Newbery may have used the imprisonment of his son-in-law as leverage to control the publication of Smart's work and as a warning to others who worked for him not to cross him. Another theory suggests Smart's actions were a result of alcohol, and had nothing to do with a mental imbalance. However, Smart may have been imprisoned for embarrassing his father-in-law in some way, which could have resulted from an incident in which Smart drank. Hester Thrale reinforced this latter possibility when she claimed that Smart's \"religious fervor\" tended to coincide with times that Smart was intoxicated. Smart's own testimony that he \"blessed God in St. James's Park till I routed all the company\" (\"Jubilate Agno\" B 90–91) as representing his religious madness is equally dismissed as resulting from drinking, as he was known for pulling pranks and the Board of Green Cloth, the government body that controlled St James's Park, would treat most disturbances in the park as resulting from madness. If Smart was placed into the asylum as a result of actions at St James's, he would not have been the only one, since records show that the Board of Green Cloth was responsible for admitting sixteen people to Bethlem Hospital for \"frenzy\" at St James's Park during the century prior to Smart being placed in St Luke's.\n\nThe specific events of Smart's confinement are unknown. He may have been in a private madhouse before St Luke's and later moved from St Luke's to Mr Potter's asylum until his release. At St Luke's, he transitioned from being \"curable\" to \"incurable\", and was moved to Mr Potter's asylum for monetary reasons. During Smart's confinement time, his wife Anna left and took the children with her to Ireland. There is no record that he ever saw her again. His isolation led him into writing religious poetry, and he abandoned the traditional genres of the 18th century that marked his earlier poetry when he wrote \"Jubilate Agno\".\n\nDuring his time in asylum, Smart busied himself with a daily ritual of writing poetry; these lyric fragments eventually formed his \"Jubilate Agno\" and \"A Song to David\". Smart might have turned to writing poetry as a way to focus the mind or as self-therapy. Although 20th-century critics debate whether his new poetic self-examination represents an expression of evangelical Christianity, his poetry during his isolation does show a desire for \"unmediated revelation\" from God. There is an \"inner light\" that serves as a focal point for Smart and his poems written during his confinement, and that inner light connects him to the Christian God.\n\nFew details are known about Smart's time at St Luke's Hospital for Lunatics. He was admitted to St Luke's on 6 May 1757 as a \"Curable Patient\". It is possible that Smart was confined at Newbery's behest over old debts and a poor relationship that existed between the two; Newbery had previously mocked Smart's immorality in \"A Collection of Pretty Poems for the Amusement of Children six Foot High.\" Regardless of Newbery's exact reasons, there is evidence suggesting that Newbery's admittance of Smart into the mental asylum was not based on madness. To have Smart admitted, Newbery probably provided a small bribe, although bribes were against St Luke's policy.\n\nThere is little information about Smart's condition during his stay at St Luke's, possibly because Battie's denied his patients from being visited, including by their own family members. One of the few records that survive of Smart's time at St Luke's was an entry in \"St Luke's Minute Book\", which read:\n\n12 May 1758Dr. Battie having acquainted this Committee that Christopher Smart (who was admitted on the 6th day of May 1757) continues disordered in his Senses notwithstanding he has been admitted into this Hospital above 12 Calendar Months and from the present Circumstances of his Case there is not Suffit. reason to expect his speedy Recovery And he being brought up and examined. Ordered. That he be discharged and that Notice be sent to his Securities to take him away.\n\nDuring Smart's confinement at St Luke's, not even other doctors were allowed to see Smart unless they had received personal permission from Battie. It was improbable that Smart could have left the asylum without being released by Battie. Even if Smart would have attempted to obtain release via legal means, the rules for subpoenaing release would have been almost impossible to follow based on the system that Battie had in place, which isolated the individual from all contact. Eventually, Smart was deemed \"incurable\" and would not have been released by the hospital but for its lack of funds.\n\nAfter being released from St Luke's, Smart was taken to a private madhouse. Elizabeth LeNoir, Smart's daughter, was brought to see her father and stated that he was \"committed by Mr Newbery to the care of a \"Mr Potter\" who kept a private house at Bethnal Green\". She described her experience as being held in a \"small neat parlour\". However, Mr Potter's private madhouse was not \"homely\", and Smart's treatments were far worse, as he describes: \"For they work on me with their harping-irons, which is a barbarous instrument, because I am more unguarded than others\" (\"Jubilate Agno\" B 129). Smart was left alone for four years, except for his cat Jeoffry and the occasional gawker who would come to see those deemed mad. Piozzi described Smart's general situation: \"He was both a wit and a scholar, and visited as such while under confinement for MADNESS.\" It is very possible that he felt \"homeless\" during his confinement and surely felt that he was in a \"limbo... between public and private space\" from being watched by outsiders.\n\nIn London, only a few of his works were still being published, but the proceeds were taken by Newbery. However, Smart did get to see published a collection of his work under the pseudonym \"Mrs Midnight\" titled \"Mrs. Midnight's Orations; and other Select Pieces: as they were spoken at the Oratory in the Hay-Market, London\". Smart did not profit from the work, but he was able to see at least some of his previous work being printed again. Smart, according to his 20th-century biographer Arthur Sherbo, had only \"his God and his poetry\". A few of his loyal friends eventually grew tired of the treatment Smart received and freed him from Mr Potter's.\n\nThere is little information about how and why Smart was released from asylum, but his daughter claimed: \"He grew better, and some misjudging friends who misconstrued Mr Newbery's great kindness in placing him under necessary & salutary restriction which might possibly have eventually wrought a cure, invited him to dinner and he returned to his confinement no more.\" What is known about the actual events is that John Sherratt, Christopher Smart's friend, believed that Smart's confinement was unfair and wanted to negotiate Smart's release. In January 1763, he met with a parliamentary committee to discuss the issue of individuals falsely imprisoned and abuses that they would receive in asylums. In particular, Sherratt argued that many were admitted for habitual intoxication, which undermined Battie's and other asylum keeper's reputations. A finding by the parliamentary committee released 27 January 1763 bolstered Sherratt's chances to release Smart. To those around him, Smart appeared perfectly sane, and he was most likely released because of legislation concurrently being passed in parliament advocating for a reform to patient care. Smart left the asylum on 30 January 1763 with Sherratt.\n\nUpon leaving asylum, Smart took the manuscripts of \"A Song to David\", many translations of Psalms, and \"Jubilate Agno\". \"A Song to David\" was published on 6 April 1763. Harsh reviews followed which mocked Smart's time in the asylum instead of dealing with the poems. \"Jubilate Agno\" stayed in manuscript form and passed into the hands of the friends of William Cowper, a poet also placed into asylum and Smart's contemporary, when they investigated the concept of \"madness\". The work stayed in private holdings until it was rediscovered in the 20th century by William Stead. It was not published until 1939 when it was printed with the title \"Rejoice in the Lamb: A Song from Bedlam\".\n\nSamuel Johnson's biographer James Boswell described a moment when Charles Burney inquired of his friend Johnson of Smart's state. Johnson used the term \"madness\" to comment on the state of society before explaining to Burney that Smart's actions that were deemed symptoms of madness were actually reasonable:\n\nMadness frequently discovers itself merely by unnecessary deviation from the usual mode of the world. My poor friend Smart shewed the disturbance of his mind, by falling upon his knees, and saying his prayers in the street, or in any other unusual place. Now although, rationally speaking, it is greater madness not to pray at all, than to pray as Smart did, I am afraid there are so many who do not pray, that their understanding is not called in question.Concerning this unfortunate poet, Christopher Smart, who was confined in a mad-house, he had, at another time, the following conversation with Dr [Charles] Burney: – Burney. 'How does poor Smart do, Sir; is he likely to recover?' Johnson. 'It seems as if his mind had ceased to struggle with the disease; for he grows fat upon it.' Burney. 'Perhaps, Sir, that may be from want of exercise.' Johnson. 'No, Sir; he has partly as much exercise as he used to have, for he digs in the garden. Indeed, before his confinement, he used for exercise to walk to the ale-house; but he was \"carried\" back again. I did not think he ought to be shut up. His infirmities are not noxious to society. He insisted on people praying with him; and I'd as lief pray with Kit <nowiki>[=Christopher]</nowiki> Smart as any one else. Another charge was that he did not love clean linen; and I have no passion for it.' – Johnson continued. 'Mankind have a great aversion to intellectual labour; but even supposing knowledge to be easily attainable, more people would be content to be ignorant than would take even a little trouble to acquire it.'\n\nIn an article printed in the \"Gentleman's Magazine\", Hester Piozzi, Smart's acquaintance and Johnson's close friend, argued that in many aspects Smart appears sane:\n\nIn every \"other\" transaction of life no man's wits could be more regular than those of Smart, for this prevalence of one idea pertinaciously keeping the first place in his head had in no sense, except in what immediately related to itself, perverted his judgement at all; his opinions were unchanged as before, nor did he seem more likely to fall into a state of \"distraction\" than any other man; less so, perhaps, as he calmed every violent start of passion by prayer.\n\nBeyond Smart's circle of friends, few were willing to dismiss claims that Smart was affected by madness. Most contemporary literary critics knew of Smart's time in asylum and, upon publication of his \"A Song to David\", called attention to aspects of the poem which they could use to claim that Smart was still \"mad\". The view was widely held, and the poet William Mason wrote to Thomas Gray, \"I have seen his Song to David & from thence conclude him as mad as ever.\"\n\nIt was a century before a positive twist was put on Christopher Smart's time in asylum; the Victorian poet Robert Browning argued that \"A Song to David\" was great because Smart was mad at the time. In his poem \"Parleyings\" (1887), Browning claimed:\nTo Browning, Smart's temporary madness was what allowed him to compose in \"A Song to David\" poetry similar to that of John Milton and John Keats. Christopher Smart, as Browning's poem continued,\nBrowning's remarks brought about a later appreciation of \"A Song to David\" and Smart's madness. A review of Browning's \"Parleying\" claimed that Christopher Smart was \"possessed by his subject... and where there is true possession – where the fires of the poet's imagination are not choked by self-consciousness or by too much fuel from the intellect – idiosyncrasy, mannerism, and even conventional formulae are for the time 'burnt and purged away'.\"\n\nThe 19th-century poet Dante Gabriel Rossetti emphasised the benefits of Smart's madness and claimed that \"A Song to David\" was \"the only great \"accomplished\" poem of the last century.\" Two years later, Francis Palgrave continued the theme when he wrote that the \"Song\" exhibited \"noble wildness and transitions from grandeur to tenderness, from Earth to Heaven\" and that it was \"unique in our Poetry.\" Seven years after Palgrave, critic John Churton Collins agreed with Rossetti and Palgrave, but to a lesser extent, when he wrote, \"This poem stands alone, the most extraordinary phenomenon, perhaps, in our literature, the one rapt strain in the poetry of the eighteenth century, the work of a poet who, though he produced much, has not produced elsewhere a single line which indicates the power here displayed.\"\n\nTwentieth-century critics favoured the view that Smart suffered from some kind of mental distress when writing his poems. A review by \"Mathews\" titled \"Thin Partitions\", in 30 March 1901 \"The Academy\", claimed that:\nNow Christopher Smart was a very beggarly poet of the eighteenth century [...] but had not the smallest claim to rank with those great men beyond their common trade of poem. Kit Smart, in fact, though he wrote a pestilent deal of verse, could not write poetry—nor anything else [...] Legally mad, that is; for he appears to have been very mad in his senses, and a decent citizen out of them. He went mad—legally and medically—once, and nothing came out of it, perhaps because he was not mad enough. Then he went mad again and being duly shut up in Bedlam wrote one of the finest outbursts of lyric genius in the eighteenth century—perhaps \"the\" finest-before the advent of Blake [...] Smart regained his senses, and therewith his hopeless inability to write poetry. And he never did anything after.\nIn 1933, A. E. Housman sided with Browning's and Mathew's interpretation and connected Smart's madness with poetic genius in his lecture \"The Name and Nature of Poetry\": \"As matters actually stand, who are the English poets of that age in whom pre-eminently one can hear and recognize the true poetic accent emerging clearly from the contemporary dialect? These four: Collins, Christopher Smart, Cowper, and Blake. And what other characteristic had these four in common? They were mad.\" In 1994, Branimir Rieger differed from Housman's view by distancing Smart from the others when he argued that \"Collins and Cowper pine as isolated individuals, guiltily aware of a vitality that is not finally human but divine. Smart soars beyond individuality to embrace that vitality, but at a cost of all human relationship.\"\n\nHowever, there are many that disagreed that Smart suffered from madness; Edward Ainsworth and Charles Noyes, when discussing Smart's \"Hymn to the Supreme Being\", said, \"The mind that composed this hymn was not deranged. Yet in the poem one sees the morbidly religious mind which, in disorder, was to produce the \"Jubilate Agno\", and, with order restored, the \"Song to David\". Additionally, they claimed that Smart's\npreternatural excitement to prayer seems to have been poor Smart's only real mental aberration, unless his drunkenness be considered pathological. When his mind was removed entirely from the field of prayer, he was but little changed from his sane state. His powers of reason, though thus warped, were not taken from him, and he neither raved nor sank into mental lethargy.\nNevertheless, Ainsworth and Noyes were not completely sceptical about Smart's diagnosis when they continued: \"But when the desire to pray struck him, Smart abandoned what the world chose to call rationality.\"\n\nIn 1960, neurologist Russell Brain diagnosed Smart as suffering from cyclothymia or manic depression. Brain based his diagnosis on Smart's own claims about how he felt, and he concluded that \"in Smart's case the mental illness was not the result of his drunkenness, but he drank because he was mentally unstable.\" Arthur Sherbo, in 1967, argued that \"The nature of Smart's madness is impossible to diagnose at this distance in time\" and then argued that:\nsince Battie himself pronounced him uncured, he must have been subject to hallucinations. Strong drink, taken often enough and in sufficient quantity, will have that effect, of course, but Battie, distinguishing between 'original' and 'consequential' madness [...] would allow only that excessive drinking could 'become a very common, tho' remoter cause of Madness.' Others differed: John Ball in his \"Modern Practice of Physic\", 1760, lists 'anxiety of mind' and too much 'strong vinous or spirituous liquors' as 'antecedent causes' of madness. Smart's mania, however it manifested itself, and it usually manifested itself in loud public prayer, did not stem from drunkenness; it was aggravated, however, by frequent recourse to the bottle. Ironically enough, as Mrs. Piozzi recognised, if Smart had prayed in the privacy of his home, all might have been well for him.\n\nThe possible religious component of Smart's condition was taken up by 20th-century critics as an explanation for why the 18th century saw Smart as mad. Laurence Binyon, in 1934, believed that religion played a major role in how society viewed Smart: \"Smart's madness seems to have taken the form of a literal interpretation of the injunction \"Pray without ceasing\". He embarrassed visitors by insisting on their joining him in his supplications [...] Obsession with a fixed idea is a common form of insanity. But such obsessions are a mental imprisonment; whereas the \"Song\" is unmistakably the expression of a great release.\" Binyon's idea was picked up by Sophia Blaydes, in 1966, who pointed out that society was prejudiced against those who experienced enthusiasm, a strong spiritual connection to God. It was against religious prejudice that she argued,\nThe cause of Smart's eclipse may be traced in part to a prejudice of the age, one which was founded in reason but developed in fear. There was one inescapable fact which hampered any clear perception of Smart's work—he had been confined for madness. It was easier to use a difficult allusion or unusual image as evidence of madness than to interpret it. What could cause a fundamentally rational group of people to react so irrationally? To some degree, it was the fear of 'enthusiasm'.\nIn the 18th century, as Blaydes continued, the word changed from possessed by god to inspired to falsely inspired. The result of this change was that British society viewed enthusiasm as the enemy to both reason and social order. Thus, \"Smart, the hack-writer, would not have been greeted by a hostile audience, but Smart, the enthusiast, would have been condemned immediately. The result would be obvious: his past work, previously lauded, would be ignored, and his future work would receive immediate condemnation. such was the history of Smart's contemporary reputation.\" In determining if Smart was really mad or not, Blaydes concluded, \"in Smart's day, any sign of enthusiasm would have been cause for the judgment of madness [...] Two accounts of Smart and the nature of his madness have been preserved for us. Each permits some doubt that the poet was mad and could be regarded so in any age.\"\n\nFrances Anderson, in 1974 characterised Smart's \"illness\" as insanity and obsession, but believed that \"Smart's madness consisted of his efforts to obey literally St Paul's injunction to the Thessalonians: 'Pray without ceasing. During his episodes of illness, as Anderson continued, Smart \"probably suffered some periods of delirium\" but also \"appeared to know what he was doing\". Smart's actions were similar to 18th-century Methodists that were \"addicted to public prayer with what was thought to be overly charged high spirits. Such displayers of religious emotionalism were often confined not only to private madhouses, but also to Bedlam\". Later, in 1998, Charles Rosen pointed out that \"The Enlightenment condemned religious enthusiasm as appropriate for the uneducated and the great unwashed\" and \"it is understandable that the only original and vital religious poetry between 1760 and 1840 should have been written by poets considered genuinely mad by their contemporaries: Smart, Blake, and Hölderlin.\"\n\nAccounts at the end of the 20th century focused on the effects of Smart's confinement. Clement Hawes, following Michel Foucault's interpretation of the 18th century that there was an animality' of madness\", believed that Smart emotionally connected with animals because of the \"medical stigmatization\" he felt at the hands of his fellow man. Chris Mounsey, agreeing with Hawes's interpretation, believed that Smart's treatment was \"a bestializing process and had taught him to hold his tongue and sit out his time as quietly as possible.\" Contrary to the bestialisation, Allan Ingram argued that \"Jubilate Agno\" was \"a poetic phenomenon that would have demolished contemporary poetic orthodoxies had it been publishable. The mad individual presented a gross distortion of the human form that nevertheless insisted on remaining human, but mad language could be even more disturbing.\"\n\n\n"}

Concerns were expressed that Gibson had led a profligate lifestyle, renting an upmarket town house, leasing a luxury car and office space, undergoing cosmetic dental procedures, purchasing designer clothes and holidaying internationally, on money claimed to have been raised or destined for charity.\n\nThe media were increasingly reporting specified fraudulent claims by Gibson and The Whole Pantry regarding charity fundraising and donation-making, and detailed the many inconsistencies in Gibson's claimed medical history. With a collapsing social media support base, in an April 2015 interview Gibson admitted that her claims of cancers had been fabricated, stating that \"none of it's true\".\n\nGibson's actions have been described as \"particularly predatory\", and \"deceit on a grand scale, for personal profit\".\n\nOn May 6, 2016, Consumer Affairs Victoria announced legal action against Gibson and Inkerman Road Nominees Pty Ltd (originally known as Belle Gibson Pty Ltd) for \"false claims by Ms Gibson and her company concerning her diagnosis with terminal brain cancer, her rejection of conventional cancer treatments in favour of natural remedies, and the donation of proceeds to various charities.\" Penguin Australia Pty Ltd, publishers of \"The Whole Pantry\" book, had cooperated with the investigation and agreed to make a $30,000 donation to the Victorian Consumer Law Fund, acknowledging that it had not taken adequate steps to verify Gibson's claims prior to publishing the book. On 15 March 2017, the Federal Court supported most of those claims, concluding that “Ms Gibson had no reasonable basis to believe she had cancer.\"\n\nAccording to interviews she has given, Gibson left her Brisbane family home at age 12 to live with a classmate, and later she lived with a family friend. Gibson attended Wynnum State High School in Manly, Brisbane, before, at around the age of 16, dropping out of school in Year 10, although she also later claimed to have been home schooled. Gibson worked for some time as a trainee for catering supply company PFD Food Services in Lytton, Queensland, but social media reflected that by late 2008, at either 16 or 17 years of age (given an October 1991 birth date), she had relocated to Perth, where she was involved in the skateboarding culture and actively participating in its online community. Gibson subsequently moved from Perth to Melbourne in July 2009 at age 17, and became a mother in July 2010, at age 18. Gibson launched The Whole Pantry application in August 2013, at age 21.\n\nGibson reportedly told a prospective business partner in 2014 that she had \"several names\" that she went under, and in her most recent interview with \"The Australian Women's Weekly\" claimed \"her mother changed her name five times\". Gibson's corporate filings indicate that she is three years younger than she publicly claims to be.\n\nIn interviews, Gibson stated that since 2009 she had self-treated her then claimed malignant brain and various other cancers (blood, spleen, uterus, liver, kidney and neurological) through diet, exercise, the \"power of fruits, vegetables\", Ayurvedic practices, craniosacral therapy, colonic irrigations and (controversial) Gerson treatments. Gibson attributed the onset of her claimed cancers to a reaction to cervical cancer vaccine Gardasil.\n\nGibson launched The Whole Pantry application in August 2013, and there were reportedly 200,000 downloads within the first month. Gibson soon after signed a book deal with Lantern Books for an accompanying table top cookbook (published in October 2014), and was working with Apple in September 2014, to transition the application as a privileged preinstalled default Third Party inclusion in the Apple Watch launch, which was scheduled for April 2015.\n\nApple took steps to promote Gibson internationally after it saw The Whole Pantry app.\n\nBy early 2015, it was estimated that in excess of $1 million had been made in sales of The Whole Pantry application and book. Gibson chronicled her battle with cancer on a blog, by the same name The Whole Pantry, but \"doubts about her claims surfaced after she failed to deliver a promised $300,000 donation to a charity\".\n\nBefore doubts were raised about her health and charitable donation claims, Gibson had intended to expand the brand beyond the health, lifestyle and 'wellbeing' reflected in the Whole Pantry application and book, having earlier registered the domain The Whole Life, and advertised in December 2014 to recruit an IT specialist to expand the application and brand portfolio. Both The Whole Pantry App and The Whole Life were registered by her partner, Clive Rothwell, in Gibson's corporate name. The Whole Pantry registrar was amended in March 2015 after the controversy broke.\n\nWhile The Whole Pantry has unequivocally denied that Gibson ever helped anyone to reject conventional cancer treatment, Gibson has been quoted from her social media posts as claiming that she had \"countless times helped others\" to forgo conventional medical treatment for cancers and to treat themselves 'naturally', as well as \"leading them down natural therapy for everything from fertility, depression, bone damage and other types of cancer\".\n\nWhen the book was launched in November 2014, Gibson claimed in its preface that she had been \"stable for two years now with no growth of the cancer\", but her story soon emerged as inconsistent: she also told media outlets that the cancer had reached her liver and kidneys, and three months earlier had posted on The Whole Pantry's Facebook page that her cancer had spread to her blood, spleen, brain and uterus. She previously claimed that she had undergone heart surgery operations several times and to have momentarily died on the operating table. However, there were no scars as a result of heart surgery. She also claimed to have suffered a stroke. Gibson was unable to substantiate her medical claims nor name the doctors who diagnosed her condition and treated her.\n\nThe cookbook was published in Australia by Lantern Books (Penguin) and Simon & Schuster were going to publish the cookbook in Europe and the US. Penguin Publishing acknowledges that it never asked for any evidence of her medical condition, saying it published the recipe book in \"good faith\". The book was subsequently pulled from Australian and international publication, its publishers stating that despite best endeavours Gibson had failed to satisfactorily address the claims made against her regarding her health and charitable donations.\n\nFollowing adverse media coverage, there was considerable scrutiny of her story leading to doubts being cast on her cancer diagnosis, and on previous claims around her health issues, including having cancer and the multiple heart surgeries. Gibson's story was reported to be \"being erased from the internet\". In a statement Apple had initially indicated that it intended to retain the app on the Apple Watch, stating that their interest related as to only whether the app performs as it is supposed to. However the app was subsequently withdrawn from the Apple Watch, after first being removed from the Australian and US App Stores.\n\nAt the same time, claims also emerged that charity funds raised in 2013 and 2014 had not been donated to the claimed causes, which Gibson rejects, but Fairfax Media revealed that The Whole Pantry founder \"failed to hand over proceeds solicited in the name of five charities\" and had \"grossly overstated the company's total donations to different causes\". Two charities confirmed to \"The Australian\" newspaper that her company had used their names in fundraising drives but had either failed to deliver the donations or had inadequately accounted for the funds.\n\nGibson had claimed on a number of occasions in 2014 that The Whole Pantry had donated approximately $300,000 to charities involved in (among other things) maternal healthcare in developing nations, medical support for children with cancer, and funding schools in sub-Saharan Africa. In late 2014, when The Whole Pantry application was pre-installed on the Apple iPad, Gibson claimed through her Instagram account to be working with 20 different charities.\n\nGibson has long claimed in her LinkedIn professional networking profile, established in February 2013, to be a philanthropist.\n\nWhen confronted by investigative journalists about the doubtfulness of these and other claims in early 2015, Gibson admitted that she had seriously overstated the level of charitable donations that had been made. Subsequent media reporting in March 2015 revealed that it could only be ascertained that an estimated $7,000 of the previously claimed $300,000 had been donated to a total of three charities, with at least $1,000 of the $7,000 reportedly having been donated only after Gibson became aware of the Fairfax Media investigation into her earlier claims. Another $1,000 of the $7,000 had been donated to a charitable cause under her spouse Clive Rothwell's name, rather than Gibson's or the company name.\n\nAlso in March 2015, the parents of a young child suffering from brain cancer, whom Gibson had befriended, came forward to report that they had been unaware that Gibson had earlier been claiming to be fundraising for their child's treatment on their behalf. The family stated they had not known about Gibson's claim to be charity fundraising on behalf of the child, and the family had never received any funds from her or The Whole Pantry. The family suspected Gibson had been using information gleaned from the family's experiences to underpin her own claims to having brain cancer.\n\nConsumer Affairs Victoria has initiated an investigation.\n\nGibson's and The Whole Pantry's statements regarding the benefits of exercise, healthy eating and a positive mindset were uncontroversial, being widely acknowledged as conducive to holistic well being. However, on her now deleted 'OnlyBelle' Instagram account and in other social media, Gibson also promoted more controversial or potentially dangerous alternative medical practices, including: Gerson therapy, anti-vaccination, and the consumption of non-pasteurised raw milk. The highly controversial Gerson treatment had been similarly promoted by another Australian 'wellness' blogger, Jessica Ainscough, whose funeral Gibson attended when Ainscough succumbed to her cancer at age 29 in late February 2015. With approximately 97% of the population under seven years of age immunised, Australian Government vaccination policy heavily penalises parents who refuse to vaccinate their children, by denying access to significant welfare and other benefits, worth approximately $11,700 per annum. The sale of raw milk for human consumption is illegal in Australia and, in 2014 in Gibson's state of Victoria, one three-year-old died and another four children under the age of five became seriously ill after consuming non-pasteurised raw milk.\n\nAs the controversy grew, questions began to be raised about Apple, Penguin and the Australian media's lack of due diligence in prima facie accepting Gibson's claims to suffering multiple cancers, an issue taken up by Australia's \"Media Watch\" program.\n\nApple, in response to media enquiry in mid March 2015, declined to remove The Whole Pantry application from sale, stating that it was only concerned about the functionality of an application. However, The Whole Pantry was soon thereafter removed from inclusion in the Apple Watch launch. Apple subsequently deleted the application from the Apple Store, and soon thereafter also removed it from all Apple Watch promotional material. Apple has not provided any public comment regarding the reasons behind the removal of The Whole Pantry application from the Apple Store and Apple Watch, but an internal email from an Australian executive to the US team acknowledged that the removal would be subject to comment.\n\nLantern Books (Penguin), when initially approached by investigative journalists, claimed it had not confirmed the validity of Gibson's cancer claims as it was not required to as the book was \"a collection of recipes\". Soon after, in mid March 2015 and as the controversy grew, Penguin withdrew the book from sale, citing a lack of response from Gibson to its queries relating to the media accusations. Fairfax Media, however, reported that Penguin had, prior to publication of the book, already quizzed (and videotaped) Gibson on her cancer story as recounted in the preface. Penguin Australia agreed to pay AU30,000 to the Victorian Consumer Law Fund as a penalty for failing to validate the factual content of the book.\n\nAfter the Media Watch segment aired, the \"Elle Australia\" magazine admitted that following its laudatory story on Gibson, \"The Most Inspiring Woman You've Met This Year\", which was published in December 2014, Elle Australia had received anonymous but specific claims that Gibson was fabricating her story, but ultimately dismissed the email as \"lies\".\n\nA second Bauer Media Group magazine, \"Cosmopolitan\", which had awarded Gibson its 2014 'Fun, Fearless Female' social media award, later revealed that it too had received an email, but had dismissed out of hand the email's accusations that Gibson was fabricating her story. Subsequently, on 24 April 2015, after Gibson had admitted to having faked her cancers, in defending the magazine's decision not to strip Gibson of its 2014 social media award, Cosmopolitan's editor stated that Gibson had been \"reader nominated and reader voted\", the award being \"a competition where readers are nominating people that they're inspired by\". However, Cosmopolitan's Associate Editor had a month earlier, on 17 March 2015, stated in the magazine's \"honest account\" of the its dealings with Gibson that \"I put forward the nomination myself\", indicating that Cosmopolitan magazine, rather than the public, had been instrumental in promoting Gibson's award.\n\nA conventional cancer research professional from the Garvan Institute of Medical Research also went public to state that, by failing to conduct basic fact checking and providing \"unfiltered PR\" to Gibson's untested claims, an uncritical media had been complicit in Gibson's \"scam\".\n\nOnce the controversy surfaced in the media, The Whole Pantry began removing any comments made on its (since deleted) Facebook page that questioned the now suspect health and charitable claims that Gibson and the company had made, asserting that these comments only added to \"the misinformation\" of the initial Fairfax Media article. This selective deletion drew even more negative comment.\n\nSimultaneously, posts that Gibson had made on her Healing Belle Instagram account that made reference to her cancers or charitable donations were also being selectively deleted, drawing further negative comment to the effect that particularly Gibson's cancer-related claims were suddenly \"being erased from the internet\". Soon after, all posts were deleted from the Healing Belle and The Whole Pantry Instagram accounts. Around the same time, individual postings about her cancer, and claims of having died briefly while under heart surgery, which Gibson had made in 2009 on blogs that she did not directly control, were also being selectively deleted by the administrator of the blog \"at the request of a user\". Both the Whole Pantry and Healing Belle accounts across a number of social media platforms were soon either abandoned, made private, or deleted in their entirety.\n\nGibson subsequently established another Facebook account under the alias Harry Gibson, which was made private, and used to hit back at Facebook followers questioning her claims or speaking to the media.\n\nIn late April 2015, Gibson gave an interview to \"The Australian Women's Weekly\", in which she admitted to having fabricated all her cancer claims. Gibson attributed her lying to her childhood upbringing, and specifically to neglect by her now-estranged mother, claiming to having been forced to take care of herself and her brother since the age of five. The interview was, however, described as an admission of deceit, without expression of regret or apology. In a May 2015 interview with the same magazine, Gibson's mother Natalie Dal-Bello refuted several claims Gibson had made about her upbringing. This included the claim that her brother was autistic, even though he – also interviewed for the magazine – is not.\n\nGibson's late April 2015 interview with \"The Australian Women's Weekly\", in which she admitted faking her cancers, was arranged by Bespoke Approach, and Gibson was provided \"pro bono\" representation by the company during the interview.\n\nIn June 2015, Gibson was rumored to have received $45,000 for an interview with \"60 Minutes\". Stefanie Spinks wrote that \"by accepting $45,000 for her interview, Belle is sending the message that people can profit off stealing, lying and taking advantage of people's good intentions.\" During this interview, she claimed to have been visited at home by a doctor named Mark Johns who had an electronic machine with paddles and lights that was \"German technology\" that diagnosed her cancers. She also believed she was taking oral chemotherapy prescribed by this same doctor. No one has found any trace of this person nor any information on the portable machine that was used to make a diagnosis.\n\nConsumer Affairs Victoria brought legal action against Gibson for allegedly breaking Australian consumer law. The regulator said it had conducted an in-depth investigation of Gibson's activities and applied to Australia's Federal Court for leave to pursue legal action. Gibson's publisher, Penguin Australia, has already agreed to pay A$30,000 ($22,200; £15,300) to the Victorian Consumer Law Fund as a penalty for releasing The Whole Pantry, which was not fact checked.\n\nOn 15 March 2017, Federal Court Justice Debra Mortimer delivered the decision that “most but not all” of the claims were proven. Gibson did not appear in court for the decision. Justice Mortimer found Gibson's claims had been misleading and deceptive, and that “Ms Gibson had no reasonable basis to believe she had cancer from the time she began making these claims in public to promote \"The Whole Pantry Book\" and the apps in mid-2013,” but there was not enough evidence to prove that she was not acting out of delusion.\n\nIn September, 2017, Belle Gibson was fined A$410,000 (US$310,000; £240,000) for making false claims about her donations to charity. As of July 2018, Gibson had not yet paid the fine, and authorities were seeking power to charge her with contempt of court.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "827023", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=827023", "title": "Bleed air", "text": "Bleed air\n\nBleed air produced by gas turbine engines is compressed air that is taken from the compressor stage of those engines, which is upstream of the fuel-burning sections. In modern airliner engines, two regulator valves (high stage and low stage) turn on and off automatically and are controlled by at least \"...two air supply and cabin pressure controllers (ASCPCs) which open and close appropriate valves. Engine bleed air comes from the high stage or low stage engine compressor section. Low stage air is used during high power setting operation, and high stage air is used during descent and other low power setting operations.\" Bleed air from that system can be utilized for internal cooling of the engine, cross-starting another engine, engine and airframe anti-icing, cabin pressurization, pneumatic actuators, air-driven motors, pressurizing the hydraulic reservoir, and waste and water storage tanks. Some engine maintenance manuals refer to such systems as \"customer bleed air\". Bleed air is valuable in an aircraft for two properties: high temperature and high pressure (typical values are 200–250 °C and 275 kPa (40 PSI), for regulated bleed air exiting the engine pylon for use throughout the aircraft).\n\nIn civil aircraft, bleed air's primary use is to provide pressure for the aircraft cabin by supplying air to the environmental control system. Additionally, bleed air is used to keep critical parts of the plane (such as the wing leading edges) ice-free.\n\nBleed air is used on many aircraft systems because it is easily available, reliable, and a potent source of power. For example, bleed air from an airplane engine is used to start the remaining engines. Lavatory water storage tanks are pressurized by bleed air that is fed through a pressure regulator.\n\nWhen used for cabin pressurization, the bleed air from the engine must first be cooled (as it exits the compressor stage at temperatures as high as 250 °C) by passing it through an air-to-air heat exchanger cooled by cold outside air. It is then fed to an air cycle machine unit that regulates the temperature and flow of air into the cabin, keeping the environment comfortable.\n\nBleed air is also used to heat the engine intakes. This prevents ice from forming, accumulating, breaking loose, and being ingested by the engine, possibly damaging it.\n\nOn aircraft powered by jet engines, a similar system is used for wing anti-icing by the 'hot-wing' method. In icing conditions, water droplets condensing on a wing's leading edge can freeze. If that happens, the ice build-up adds weight and changes the shape of the wing, causing a degradation in performance, and possibly a critical loss of control or lift. To prevent this, hot bleed air is pumped through the inside of the wing's leading edge, heating it to a temperature above freezing, which prevents the formation of ice. The air then exits through small holes in the wing edge.\n\nOn propeller-driven aircraft, it is common to use bleed air to inflate a rubber boot on the leading edge, breaking the ice loose after it has already formed.\n\nBleed air from the high-pressure compressor of the engine is used to supply reaction control valves as used for part of the flight control system in the Harrier jump jet family of military aircraft.\n\nOn rare occasions, bleed air used for air-conditioning, and pressurization can be contaminated by chemicals such as oil or hydraulic fluid. This is known as a fume event. While those chemicals can be irritating, such rare events have not been established to cause long term harm.\n\nCertain neurological and respiratory ill health effects have been linked anecdotally to exposure to bleed air that has been alleged to have been contaminated with toxic levels on commercial and military aircraft. This alleged long-term illness is referred to as Aerotoxic Syndrome by agenda groups, but it is not a medically recognized syndrome. One alleged potential contaminant is tricresyl phosphate.\n\nMany lobbying groups have been set up to advocate for research into this alleged hazard. The groups include the Aviation Organophosphate Information Site (AOPIS) (2001), the Global Cabin Air Quality Executive (2006) and the UK-based Aerotoxic Association (2007). Cabin Environment Research is one of many functions of the ACER Group, but their researchers have not yet established any causal relationship.\n\nAlthough a study made for the EU in 2014 confirmed that contamination of cabin air could be a problem, that study also stated:\n\nWhile no scientific evidence to date has found that airliner cabin air has been contaminated to toxic levels (exceeding known safe levels, in ppm, of any dangerous chemical), a court in Australia in March 2010, found in favor of a former airline flight attendant who claimed she suffered chronic respiratory problems after being exposed to oil fumes on a trip in March 1992, although she was able to continue working as a flight attendant and in other jobs for over 10 years after the fume event\n\nBleed air systems have been in use for several decades in passenger jets. Recent improvements in solid-state electronics have enabled pneumatic power systems to be replaced by electric power systems. In a bleedless aircraft such as the Boeing 787, each engine has two variable-frequency electrical generators to compensate for not providing compressed air to external systems. Eliminating bleed air and replacing it with extra electric generation is believed to provide a net improvement in engine efficiency, lower weight, and ease of maintenance.\n\nA bleedless aircraft achieves fuel efficiency by eliminating the process of compressing and decompressing air, and by reducing the aircraft's mass due to the removal of ducts, valves, heat exchangers, and other heavy equipment.\n\nThe APU (auxiliary power unit) does not need to supply bleed air when the main engines are not operating. Aerodynamics are improved due to the lack of bleed air vent holes on the wings. By driving cabin air supply compressors at the minimum required speed, no energy wasting modulating valves are required. High-temperature, high-pressure air cycle machine (ACM) packs can be replaced with low temperature, low-pressure packs to increase efficiency. At cruise altitude, where most aircraft spend the majority of their time and burn the majority of their fuel, the ACM packs can be bypassed entirely, saving even more energy. Since no bleed air is taken from the engines for the cabin, the potential of engine oil contamination of the cabin air supply is eliminated.\n\nLastly, advocates of the design say it improves safety as heated air is confined to the engine pod, as opposed to being pumped through pipes and heat exchangers in the wing and near the cabin, where a leak could damage surrounding systems.\n\nIn the 787, cabin air enters from under the fuselage and is compressed as required. De-icing is achieved by electro-thermal heating elements embedded in the wing's leading edge. Hydraulic pumps for flaps, slats, speed brakes and other control surfaces are also powered electrically.\n\nEliminating bleed air increases the electric load, as cabin pressurization, anti-ice/de-ice systems, and other functions need to be powered electrically instead. This necessitates an increased size of electrical generators as well as higher-power power distribution boards and more sophisticated backup and control systems.\n"}

Her repertoire has focused on dramatic soprano roles in stage works by Richard Strauss and Richard Wagner, such as the title role of \"Elektra\", and Brünnhilde in \"Der Ring des Nibelungen\", a role which she performed at the Bayreuth Festival in 2013 for Wagner's bicentenary.\n\nBorn in Nottingham, Foster played several musical instruments as a girl, and was a lead chorister in the choir of the village church from age 15. She worked first as a nurse and midwife for 15 years. Beginning in 1993 she studied voice with Pamela Cook, who trained her until her death in 2013. Foster studied at the Birmingham Conservatoire from 1995. As a recipient of the Dame Eva Turner Awards, she studied on a scholarship at the Royal Northern College of Music and completed her studies at the National Opera Studio in London in 1999. During her studies, she performed as the Queen of the Night in Mozart's \"The Magic Flute\" at the Opera of Northern Ireland in 1998 and the Welsh National Opera. She repeated the role when she sang at the English National Opera for the first time in 2000.\n\nShe became a member of the Nationaltheater Weimar in 2001, where she first performed roles such as Mimi in Puccini's \"La Bohème\", Elisabeth in Wagner's \"Tannhäuser\", Leonore in both Beethoven's \"Fidelio\" and Verdi's \"Il trovatore\", Senta in Wagner's \"Der Fliegende Holländer\", Abigaille in Verdi's \"Nabucco\" and Elektra in Mozart's \"Idomeneo\".\n\nShe changed to the dramatic repertory, appearing in title roles of \"Elektra\" by Richard Strauss, Wagner's \"Tristan und Isolde\" and Puccini's \"Turandot\". In 2007, she performed the role of Brünnhilde in Wagner's \"Der Ring des Nibelungen\" in three parts of the cycle. The production was recorded on DVD and made her known. From 2011, she has worked as a freelance singer.\n\nShe made her debut at the Bayreuth Festival in 2013 as Brünnhilde in the \"Ring\" production staged by Frank Castorf, on the occasion of the bicentenary of Wagner's birth. She performed the role also in the following years, conducted by Kirill Petrenko, Marek Janowski and Plácido Domingo. The production was recorded and broadcast internationally in 2016. She said in an interview that she never received acting training, but \"I worked for almost 15 years in a hospital and had many experiences with young and old people, with children, rich and poor, happy and sad people. This is the experience I bring to the stage.\"\n\nShe appeared as Brünnhilde also at the Staatstheater Wiesbaden, in 2017 as part of the Internationale Maifestspiele. A critic wrote after a performance of \"Götterdämmerung\": \"Phrasing, understanding and pronunciation of the text, secure intonation and scenic presence are on an unusually high level! This evening, Ms. Foster succeeded in everything! Her voice was perfectly controlled in all registers up to 'C'\" (\"Phrasierung, Texterfassung und -Verständlichkeit, Intonationssicherheit, szenische Präsenz sind auf auf einem außerordentlich hohen Niveau! An diesem Abend gelang Frau Foster alles! Die Stimme blieb in allen Lagen perfekt kontrolliert bis rauf zum 'C'\").\n\nIn concert, she sang in Mahler's Eighth Symphony at the Wiener Musikverein, in his Fourth Symphony in the UK. She performed Wagner's Wesendonck Lieder in the US.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "636959", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=636959", "title": "Deductible", "text": "Deductible\n\nIn an insurance policy, the deductible is the amount paid\nout of pocket by the policy holder before an insurance provider will pay any expenses. In general usage, the term \"deductible\" may be used to describe one of several types of clauses that are used by insurance companies as a threshold for policy payments.\n\nDeductibles are typically used to deter the large number of claims that a consumer can be reasonably expected to bear the cost of. By restricting its coverage to events that are significant enough to incur large costs, the insurance firm expects to pay out slightly smaller amounts much less frequently, incurring much higher savings. As a result, insurance premiums are typically cheaper when they involve higher deductibles. For example, health insurance companies offer plans with high premiums and low deductibles, or plans with low premiums and high deductibles. One plan may have a premium of $1,087 a month with a $6,000 deductible, while a competitive plan may have a premium of $877 a month with a $12,700 deductible. The consumer with the $6,000 deductible will have to pay $6,000 in health care costs before the insurance plan pays anything. The consumer with the $12,700 deductible will have to pay $12,700. \n\nDeductibles are normally provided as clauses in an insurance policy that dictate how much of an insurance-covered expense is borne by the policyholder. They are normally quoted as a fixed quantity and are a part of most policies covering losses to the policy holder. The insurer then becomes liable for claimable expenses that exceed this amount (subject to the maximum sum claimable indicated in the contract). Depending on the policy, the deductible may apply per covered incident, or per year. For policies where incidents are not easy to delimit (health insurance, for example), the deductible is typically applied per year.\n\nSeveral deductibles can be set by the insurer based on the cause of the claim. For example, a single housing insurance policy may contain multiple deductible amounts for loss or damage arising from theft, fire, natural calamities, evacuation etc.\n\nThere are also deductible reimbursement programs that reimburse a deductible in the event of an automobile, home, boat/yacht or health insurance claim.\n\nA deductible should not be confused with a franchise. Where a deductible represents a part of the expense for which the insurer is not liable, the franchise is a pure threshold that, when exceeded, transfers liability for the \"entire\" expense to the insurer. For example, with a franchise of $20,000, a claim of $19,900 is borne entirely by the policy holder and a claim of $20,500 is borne entirely by the insurer.\n\nAn excess can refer to one of two very different insurance terms.\n\nThe first is excess-post-hospitalization which refers to the extra costs borne by the insured over and above the maximum coverage that the insurance company pays. This terminology is especially common in areas of insurance sensitive to loss (like liability insurance) and is addressed by the insurance market through excess line insurance companies through mechanisms like excess insurance, gap insurance, and umbrella insurance.\n\nThe second is excess-pre-hospitalization which refers to an insurance exception that is (often interchangeably but wrongly) referred to also as an excess or a deductible. It is \"the first amount of the claim which the insured has to bear. If the insured has an excess of $500 and the total repair costs $3,000, then the insured has to pay $500 while the insurer pays the remaining $2,500.\"\n\nIn a typical automobile insurance policy, a deductible will apply to claims arising from damage to or loss of the policy holder's own vehicle, whether this damage/loss is caused by accidents for which the holder is responsible, or vandalism and theft. Depending on the policy, the deductible may differ based on the type of expense incurred that triggers the insurance claim.\n\nThird-party liability coverages including auto liability, general liability, garagekeepers, inland marine, professional liability and workers compensation are also written with deductibles. These deductibles on commercial liability policies are known as third party deductibles or liability deductibles. Because the insured and claimant are not the same entity, insurers cannot pay the claim minus the deductible. This creates a receivable owed from the insured to the insurer. Due to the complexity of identifying these third party deductible receivables, many are often missed by the insurer causing millions of dollars to go uncollected.\n\nMost health insurance policies and some travel insurance policies have deductibles as well. The type of health insurance deductibles can also vary, as individual amounts and family amounts.\n\nGiven the nature of medical treatment, the insured often faces multiple medical expenses spread over several days for a single illness or injury. Due to this reason, health insurance deductibles often tend to be imposed on a term basis (e.g. annually) as opposed to a per-visit threshold. In spite of this, major medical insurance policies may have a per-visit excess which often does not cover the cost of routine visits to a GP, unless it is certified to be a part of a continuous treatment (and the bills can be collated in a single claim).\n\nIn industrial risks it is also common for the deductible to be expressed as a percentage of the loss, often though not always, with a minimum and maximum amount. This is similar to co-insurance, where the company pays a certain percentage of the losses, coupled with minimum and maximum payment thresholds. For example, with a deductible of 10% with a minimum of $1,500 and maximum of $5,000, a claim of $25,000 would incur a deductible of $2,500 (i.e. 10% of the loss) and the resulting payment would be $22,500. A claim below $15,000 would incur the minimum deductible of $1,500 and a claim above $50,000 would incur the maximum deductible of $5,000.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "18922036", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=18922036", "title": "General medical examination", "text": "General medical examination\n\nThe general medical examination is a common form of preventive medicine involving visits to a general practitioner by well feeling adults on a regular basis. This is generally yearly or less frequently. It is known under various non-specific names, such as the periodic health evaluation, annual physical, comprehensive medical exam, general health check, preventive health examination, medical check-up, or simply medical.\n\nIn the United Kingdom, the examination remains unpopular with the general populace.\n\nThe term is generally \"not\" meant to include visits for the purpose of newborn checks, Pap smears for cervical cancer, or regular visits for people with certain chronic medical disorders (for example, diabetes). The general medical examination generally involves a medical history, a (brief or complete) physical examination and sometimes laboratory tests. Some more advanced tests include ultrasound and mammography.\n\nIf necessary, the patient may be sent to a medical specialist for further, more detailed examinations.\n\nAlthough annual medical examinations are a routine practice in several countries, it is poorly supported by scientific evidence in the majority of the population. A 2012 Cochrane review did not find any benefit with respect to the risk of death or poor outcomes related to disease in those who received them. People who undergo yearly medical exams however are more likely to be diagnosed with medical problems.\n\nSome notable health organisations recommend against annual examinations. The American Cancer Society recommends a cancer-related health check-up annually in men and women older than 40, and every three years for those older than 20.\n\nA systematic review of studies until September 2006 concluded that the examination does result in better delivery of some other screening interventions (such as Pap smears, cholesterol screening, and faecal occult blood tests) and less patient worry. Evidence supports several of these individual screening interventions. The effects of annual check-ups on overall costs, patient disability and mortality, disease detection, and intermediate end points such a blood pressure or cholesterol, are inconclusive. A recent study found that the examination is associated with increased participation in cancer screening.\n\nThe lack of good evidence contrasts with population surveys showing that the general public is fond of these examinations, especially when they are free of charge. Despite guidelines recommending against routine annual examinations, many family physicians perform them. A fee-for-service healthcare system has been suggested to promote this practice. An alternative would be to tailor the screening interval to the age, sex, medical conditions and risk factors of each patient. This means choosing between a wide variety of tests.\n\nMost surgeons ask patients about recent general medical examination results in order to proceed with surgery [1] even though there are arguments for and against most screening interventions. Advantages include detection and subsequent prevention or early treatment of conditions such as high blood pressure, alcohol abuse, smoking, unhealthy diet, obesity and cancers. Moreover, they could improve the patient-physician relationship and decrease patient anxiety. More and more private insurance companies and even Medicare include annual physicals in their coverage. Some employers require mandatory health checkup before hiring a candidate even though it is now well known that some of the components of the prophylactic annual visit may actually cause harm. For example, lab tests and exams that are performed on healthy patients (as opposed to people with symptoms or known illnesses) are statistically more likely to be “false positives” — that is, when test results suggest a problem that doesn’t exist. Disadvantages cited include the time and money that could be saved by targeted screening (health economics argument), increased anxiety over health risks (medicalisation), overdiagnosis, wrong diagnosis (for example Athletic heart syndrome misdiagnosed as Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy) and harm, or even death, resulting from unnecessary testing to detect or confirm, often non-existent, medical problems or while performing routine procedures as a followup after screening.\n\nIt is commonly performed in the United States and Japan, whereas the practice varies among South East Asia and mainland European countries. In Japan it is required by law for regular working employees to check once a year, with a much more thorough battery of tests than other countries.\n\nThe roots of the periodic medical examination are not entirely clear. They seem to have been advocated since the 1920s. Some authors point to pleads from the 19th and early 20th century for the early detection of diseases like tuberculosis, and periodic school health examinations. The advent of medical insurance and related commercial influences seems to have promoted the examination, whereas this practice has been subject to controversy in the age of evidence-based medicine. Several studies have been performed before current evidence-based recommendation for screening were formulated, limiting the applicability of these studies to current-day practice.\n\n"}

{"id": "1169563", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1169563", "title": "Granulosa cell", "text": "Granulosa cell\n\nA granulosa cell or follicular cell is a somatic cell of the sex cord that is closely associated with the developing female gamete (called an oocyte or egg) in the ovary of mammals.\n\nIn the primary ovarian follicle, and later in follicle development (folliculogenesis), granulosa cells advance to form a multilayered cumulus oophorus surrounding the oocyte in the preovulatory or antral (or Graafian) follicle.\n\nThe major functions of granulosa cells include the production of sex steroids, as well as myriad growth factors thought to interact with the oocyte during its development. The sex steroid production begins with follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) from the anterior pituitary, stimulating granulosa cells to convert androgens (coming from the thecal cells) to estradiol by aromatase during the follicular phase of the menstrual cycle. However, after ovulation the granulosa cells turn into granulosa lutein cells that produce progesterone. The progesterone may maintain a potential pregnancy and causes production of a thick cervical mucus that inhibits sperm entry into the uterus.\n\nIn the development of the urinary and reproductive organs, the oogonia become invaginated in the gonadal ridge.\n\nThe embryological origin of granulosa cells remains controversial. In the 1970s, evidence emerged that the first cells to make contact with the oogonia were of mesonephric origin. It was suggested that mesonephric cells already closely associated with the oogonia proliferated throughout development to form the granulosa cell layer. Recently, this hypothesis has been challenged with some thorough histology. Sawyer et al. hypothesized that in sheep most of the granulosa cells develop from cells of the mesothelium (i.e., epithelial cells from the presumptive surface epithelium of the ovary). In 2013, it was proposed that both granulosa cells and the ovarian surface epithelial cells are instead derived from a precursor cell called gonadal-ridge epithelial-like cell.\nCell culture of granulosa cells can be performed \"in vitro\". Plating density (number of cells per volume of culture medium) plays a critical role for the differentiation. A lower plating density makes granulosa cells exhibit estrogen production, while a higher plating density makes them appear as progesterone producing theca lutein cells.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1581671", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1581671", "title": "Healthy diet", "text": "Healthy diet\n\nA healthy diet is a diet that helps to maintain or improve overall health. A healthy diet provides the body with essential nutrition: fluid, macronutrients, micronutrients, and adequate calories.\n\nFor people who are healthy, a healthy diet is not complicated and contains mostly fruits, vegetables, and whole grains, and includes little to no processed food and sweetened beverages. The requirements for a healthy diet can be met from a variety of plant-based and animal-based foods, although a non-animal source of vitamin B12 is needed for those following a vegan diet. Various nutrition guides are published by medical and governmental institutions to educate individuals on what they should be eating to be healthy. Nutrition facts labels are also mandatory in some countries to allow consumers to choose between foods based on the components relevant to health.\n\nA healthy lifestyle includes getting exercise every day along with eating a healthy diet. A healthy lifestyle may lower disease risks, such as obesity, heart disease, type 2 diabetes, hypertension and cancer.\n\nThere are specialized healthy diets, called medical nutrition therapy, for people with various diseases or conditions. There are also prescientific ideas about such specialized diets, as in dietary therapy in traditional Chinese medicine.\n\nThe World Health Organization (WHO) makes the following 5 recommendations with respect to both populations and individuals:\n\nWHO stated that insufficient vegetables and fruit is the cause of 2.8% of deaths worldwide.\n\nOther WHO recommendations include ensuring that foods chosen have sufficient vitamins and certain minerals, avoiding directly poisonous (e.g. heavy metals) and carcinogenic (e.g. benzene) substances, avoiding foods contaminated by human pathogens (e.g. \"E. coli\", tapeworm eggs), and replacing saturated fats with polyunsaturated fats in the diet can reduce the risk of coronary artery disease and diabetes.\n\nThe Dietary Guidelines for Americans by the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) recommends three healthy patterns of diet, summarized in table below, for a 2000 kcal diet.\n\nIt emphasizes both health and environmental sustainability and a flexible approach: the committee that drafted it wrote: \"The major findings regarding sustainable diets were that a diet higher in plant-based foods, such as vegetables, fruits, whole grains, legumes, nuts, and seeds, and lower in calories and animal-based foods is more health promoting and is associated with less environmental impact than is the current U.S. diet. This pattern of eating can be achieved through a variety of dietary patterns, including the “Healthy U.S.-style Pattern,” the “Healthy Vegetarian Pattern,\" and the \"Healthy Mediterranean-style Pattern\". Food group amounts are per day, unless noted per week.\n\nThe American Heart Association, World Cancer Research Fund, and American Institute for Cancer Research recommend a diet that consists mostly of unprocessed plant foods, with emphasis a wide range of whole grains, legumes, and non-starchy vegetables and fruits. This healthy diet is full of a wide range of various non-starchy vegetables and fruits, that provide different colors including red, green, yellow, white, purple, and orange. They note that tomato cooked with oil, allium vegetables like garlic, and cruciferous vegetables like cauliflower, provide some protection against cancer. This healthy diet is low in energy density, which may protect against weight gain and associated diseases. Finally, limiting consumption of sugary drinks, limiting energy rich foods, including “fast foods” and red meat, and avoiding processed meats improves health and longevity. Overall, researchers and medical policy conclude that this healthy diet can reduce the risk of chronic disease and cancer.\n\nIn children, consuming less than 25 grams of added sugar (100 calories) is recommended per day. Other recommendations include no extra sugars in those under 2 years old and less than one soft drink per week. As of 2017, decreasing total fat is no longer recommended, but instead, the recommendation to lower risk of cardiovascular disease is to increase consumption of monounsaturated fats and polyunsaturated fats, while decreasing consumption of saturated fats.\n\nThe Nutrition Source of Harvard School of Public Health makes the following 10 recommendations for a healthy diet:\n\nOther than nutrition, the guide recommends frequent physical exercise and maintaining a healthy body weight.\n\nDavid L. Katz, who reviewed the most prevalent popular diets in 2014, noted: \nThe weight of evidence strongly supports a theme of healthful eating while allowing for variations on that theme. A diet of minimally processed foods close to nature, predominantly plants, is decisively associated with health promotion and disease prevention and is consistent with the salient components of seemingly distinct dietary approaches.\n\nEfforts to improve public health through diet are forestalled not for want of knowledge about the optimal feeding of Homo sapiens but for distractions associated with exaggerated claims, and our failure to convert what we reliably know into what we routinely do. Knowledge in this case is not, as of yet, power; would that it were so.\n\nMarion Nestle expresses the mainstream view among scientists who study nutrition:\nThe basic principles of good diets are so simple that I can summarize them in just ten words: eat less, move more, eat lots of fruits and vegetables. For additional clarification, a five-word modifier helps: go easy on junk foods. Follow these precepts and you will go a long way toward preventing the major diseases of our overfed society—coronary heart disease, certain cancers, diabetes, stroke, osteoporosis, and a host of others... These precepts constitute the bottom line of what seem to be the far more complicated dietary recommendations of many health organizations and national and international governments—the forty-one “key recommendations” of the 2005 Dietary Guidelines, for example. ... Although you may feel as though advice about nutrition is constantly changing, the basic ideas behind my four precepts have not changed in half a century. And they leave plenty of room for enjoying the pleasures of food.\n\nIn addition to dietary recommendations for the general population, there are many specific diets that have primarily been developed to promote better health in specific population groups, such as people with high blood pressure (as in low sodium diets or the more specific DASH diet), or people who are overweight or obese (in weight control diets). However, some of them may have more or less evidence for beneficial effects in normal people as well.\n\nA low sodium diet is beneficial for people with high blood pressure. A Cochrane review published in 2008 concluded that a long term (more than 4 weeks) low sodium diet has a useful effect to reduce blood pressure, both in people with hypertension and in people with normal blood pressure.\n\nThe DASH diet (Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension) is a diet promoted by the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (part of the NIH, a United States government organization) to control hypertension. A major feature of the plan is limiting intake of sodium, and the diet also generally encourages the consumption of nuts, whole grains, fish, poultry, fruits, and vegetables while lowering the consumption of red meats, sweets, and sugar. It is also \"rich in potassium, magnesium, and calcium, as well as protein\".\n\nThe Mediterranean diet, which includes limiting consumption of red meat and using olive oil in cooking, has also been shown to improve cardiovascular outcomes.\n\nWeight control diets aim to maintain a controlled weight. In most cases, those who are overweight or obese use dieting in combination with physical exercise to lose weight.\n\nDiets to promote weight loss are divided into four categories: low-fat, low-carbohydrate, low-calorie, and very low calorie. A meta-analysis of six randomized controlled trials found no difference between the main diet types (low calorie, low carbohydrate, and low fat), with a 2–4 kilogram weight loss in all studies. At two years, all of the diets in the studies that reduced calories caused equal weight loss regardless of whether changes in fat or carbohydrate consumption were emphasized.\n\nGluten, a mixture of proteins found in wheat and related grains including barley, rye, oat, and all their species and hybrids (such as spelt, kamut, and triticale), causes health problems for those with gluten-related disorders, including celiac disease, non-celiac gluten sensitivity, gluten ataxia, dermatitis herpetiformis, and wheat allergy. In these people, the gluten-free diet is the only available treatment.\n\nThere may be a relationship between lifestyle including food consumption and potentially lowering the risk of cancer or other chronic diseases. A diet high in fruits and vegetables appears to decrease the risk of cardiovascular disease and death but not cancer.\n\nEating a healthy diet and getting enough exercise can maintain body weight in normal ranges and prevent obesity in most people, and can thus prevent the chronic diseases and poor outcomes associated with obesity.\n\nThe Western pattern diet which is typically eaten by Americans and increasingly adopted by people in the developing world as they leave poverty is unhealthy: it is \"rich in red meat, dairy products, processed and artificially sweetened foods, and salt, with minimal intake of fruits, vegetables, fish, legumes, and whole grains.\"\n\nAn unhealthy diet is a major risk factor for a number of chronic diseases including: high blood pressure, diabetes, abnormal blood lipids, overweight/obesity, cardiovascular diseases, and cancer.\n\nThe WHO estimates that 2.7 million deaths are attributable to a diet low in fruits and vegetables every year. Globally it is estimated to cause about 19% of gastrointestinal cancer, 31% of ischaemic heart disease, and 11% of strokes, thus making it one of the leading preventable causes of death worldwide.\n\nPopular diets, often referred to as fad diets, make promises of weight loss or other health advantages such as longer life without backing by solid science, and in many cases are characterized by highly restrictive or unusual food choices. Celebrity endorsements (including celebrity doctors) are frequently associated with popular diets, and the individuals who develop and promote these programs often profit handsomely.\n\nConsumers are generally aware of the elements of a healthy diet, but find nutrition labels and diet advice in popular media confusing.\n\nFears of high cholesterol were frequently voiced up until the mid-1990s. However, more recent research has shown that the distinction between high- and low-density lipoprotein ('good' and 'bad' cholesterol, respectively) must be addressed when speaking of the potential ill effects of cholesterol. Different types of dietary fat have different effects on blood levels of cholesterol. For example, polyunsaturated fats tend to decrease both types of cholesterol; monounsaturated fats tend to lower LDL and raise HDL; saturated fats tend to either raise HDL, or raise both HDL and LDL; and trans fat tend to raise LDL and lower HDL.\n\nDietary cholesterol is only found in animal products such as meat, eggs, and dairy. The effect of dietary cholesterol on blood cholesterol levels is controversial. Some studies have found a link between cholesterol consumption and serum cholesterol levels. Other studies have not found a link between eating cholesterol and blood levels of cholesterol. \n\nVending machines in particular have come under fire as being avenues of entry into schools for junk food promoters. However, there is little in the way of regulation and it is difficult for most people to properly analyze the real merits of a company referring to itself as \"healthy.\" Recently, the Committee of Advertising Practice in the United Kingdom launched a proposal to limit media advertising for food and soft drink products high in fat, salt or sugar. The British Heart Foundation released its own government-funded advertisements, labeled \"Food4Thought\", which were targeted at children and adults to discourage unhealthy habits of consuming junk food.\n\nFrom a psychological and cultural perspective, a healthier diet may be difficult to achieve for people with poor eating habits. This may be due to tastes acquired in childhood and preferences for sugary, salty and/or fatty foods.\n\nAnimals that are kept by humans also benefit from a healthy diet and the requirements of such diets may be very different from the ideal human diet.\n\n\n"}

It recognises the importance of race, culture, beliefs, values, attitudes, religion and language in the life of the client. The concept has been developed by Jafar Kareem in his book \"Intercultural Therapy\". Kareem (1992) believed that there are some intrinsic differences between individual human beings, either in their biology, their personality or both, and that both inter- and intrapsychic events profoundly affect an individual's psyche and develop as part of their unconscious life. The events of the external world, then, are real but they are also internalised. \n\nIntercultural therapy responds to the cultural variances identified by the field of anthropology. An intercultural therapist must take the external realities of a client's life into account, such as poverty, refugee status, racism, sexism, physical health and physical abilities. Kareem believed that failure to understand cultural issues may lead to major diagnostic and therapeutic errors. \n\nIntercultural therapy recognises the differences and similarities of various aspects of culture for both the client and therapist, and that the very fact of being from another culture involves both conscious and unconscious assumptions, both in the patient and in the therapist. These unconscious assumptions sometimes mean traditional modes of therapy do not address the needs of someone from outside a dominant culture, or that therapy is not offered to them in the first place.\n"}

In practice it was created a system for resistance training with a belt and a flywheel that, driven by the belt, controlling a process which generated movement regardless of the strength of gravity.\n\nThe isoinertial's muscle activity follows the muscular action of the sporting gesture or rather what the body or parts of it are in duty to perform in sports, according to which, in strength and speed variable, an inertial load (such as a ball), a limb or the body itself (such as when accelerating or changing direction) the athlete is forced to respond at the level coordinative motor and neuromuscular very quickly to situations and motor gestures sudden and not predetermined.\n\nThe great utility of the isoinertial method and at the same time what makes it different from the normal isotonic muscle movement lies in the fact that the action isotonic developed in conventional exercises (strength machines and free weights), the resistance is constant throughout the whole of movement in both the concentric phase in which the eccentric, which is equivalent to the set load. In the isoinertial method the resistance is adapted in every moment and is proportional to the force developed in the sense that the greater the force expressed by the subject in the concentric phase, the greater will be the acceleration with which the flywheel reacts.\n\n\n"}

She worked on the estate of Benjamin Harris May.\n\nMinor \"was apparently skilled medically and a very gifted, nurturing healer, someone patients really responded to,\" according to historian Susan Lebsock. \nIn 1825, a fever epidemic struck Petersburg, Virginia, and many families, black and white, were affected. As a result of her healing work, Benjamin May gave Minor her freedom. In the manumission deed, he notes that he freed Minor \"for several acts of extraordinary merit in nursing at the imminent risk of her own health and safety, exercising the most unexampled patience and attention in watching over the sick beds of several individuals of this town, as well as on account of my belief that she will in the future continue ... to perform similar acts ... \"\n\nIn 1826, she met and married Lewis Minor, a free laborer. After her emancipation, she took the name Jane Minor. The money Jane Minor earned as a medical practitioner, usually from $2-$5 per visit, allowed her to purchase and free at least sixteen slaves, some of whom cost over $2,000. In one case, in July, 1840, she bought and freed a mulatto woman named Emily Smith and her five children. In another, the same month and year, she emancipated a fellow healing practitioner named Phoebe Jackson. Lebsock says Minor was the most active free black emancipator in Petersburg, male or female.\n\nMore than 30 years after her manumission, Petersburg newspapers printed reports of operations performed by physicians in \"the Hospital of the well-known nurse Jinsey Snow.\" Cupping and leeching were standard medical practices of that time. Researchers have observed that enslaved medical practitioners like Jane Minor often brought herbal and other medical knowledge from Africa that was at that time unknown in early colonial America.\n\n"}

Several theories have been proposed for its purpose. Only the core of the structure remains today.\n\nArdashir I's new city of Gor had a circular plan with the official buildings located at the centre of an inner circle in radius. The tower-like structure of Terbal was located at the very centre of this circle. Together with Takht-e Neshin, these are the only structures of the city that are made of granite-mortar-masonry. According to \"Iranica\", these two structures may have been confused in medieval Islamic sources, and it is unclear that the names \"Aywān kiyākhurra\" () (Istakhri), \"Gunbad-i Kīrmān\" (or \"Gīrmān\"; ) and \"Īrān Garda/Girda\" () (Ibn al-Balkhi) mentioned in these sources refer to which structure. Terbal was a square structure with more than high and spiral in design. It was the core of a stair-tower, and was compared by Ibn Hawqal to a similar edifice at Balkh (a reference to a Buddhist stupa, or possibly a ziggurat). With the width of the destroyed stairs and outer walls added, its actual width is estimated to be about . The remaining structure is hollow, according to the Qajar period writer Forsat-od-Dowleh Shirazi.\n\nAmong Western orientalists and travellers, the structure was first observed by Eugène Flandin and Pascal Coste, who noted its uniqueness in Iranian architecture. Prior to Ernst Herzfeld studies of the structure, Terbal was mistakenly thought to be a descendant of the ziggurat, while some thought it is a fire temple, with the Holy Fire (\"atar\") being put at its top to avoid contamination with dust.\n\nIt is hypothesised that the structure may have been part of a government building and symbolised the divine and centralist kingship introduced by Ardashir I. It may have had practical military and civil uses as well, as the tower provided visual contact with some fortifications in the area, and/or may have been used as an observation tower to survey activities during the implementation of the planned scheme of the new city of Gor and the plain. In fact, this grand scheme was centred in Terbal and continued the concentric and radiant pattern of the town, with traces of canals, paths, walls and field borders found up to 10 km distance from this central tower.\n\nAccording to a newer study, the structure, as also described in medieval sources, may have functioned as a water tower, in such a way that water from nearby elevated sources would flow through tubes and Terbal's hollow core towards its dome, and from there it would be flowed to another tube to flow elsewhere in the town. It is argued that it was not the only purpose of the structure, but it was also part of a temple dedicated to Anahita, the divinity of the Waters (\"Aban\").\n\nIt is thought that the Terbal was the architectural predecessor of the unique minaret of Great Mosque of Samarra (also known as the \"malwiya\") in Iraq, which was built in the Abbasid period. The minaret itself inspired that of the Mosque of Ibn Tulun in Cairo, and recently Philip Johnson's design for the 1976 Chapel of Thanksgiving at Thanks-Giving Square in Dallas, Texas.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2905542", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2905542", "title": "Monoplegia", "text": "Monoplegia\n\nMonoplegia is paralysis of a single limb, usually an arm. Common symptoms associated with monoplegic patients are weakness, numbness, and pain in the affected limb. Monoplegia is a type of paralysis that falls under hemiplegia. While hemiplegia is paralysis of half of the body, monoplegia is localized to a single limb or to a specific region of the body. Monoplegia of the upper limb is sometimes referred to as brachial monoplegia, and that of the lower limb is called crural monoplegia. Monoplegia in the lower extremities is not as common of an occurrence as in the upper extremities. Monoparesis is a similar, but less severe, condition because one limb is very weak, not paralyzed. For more information, see paresis. \n\nMany conditions that cause paraplegia or quadriplegia begin as monoplegia. Thus, the diagnosis of spinal paraplegia must also be consulted. In addition, multiple cerebral disorders that cause hemiplegia may begin as monoplegia. Monoplegia is also frequently associated with, and considered to be the mildest form of, cerebral palsy. \n\nThere are a number of symptoms associated with monoplegia. Curling of the hands or stiffness of the feet, weakness, spasticity, numbness, paralysis, pain in the affected limb, headaches, and shoulder pain are all considered to be symptoms of monoplegia. Patients of monoplegia typically feel symptoms of weakness and loss of sensation in the affected extremity, usually an arm. Despite these symptoms, the extremity with paralysis continues to maintain a strong pulse. \n\nWhile chronic progressive brachial monoplegia is uncommon, syringomyelia and tumors of the cervical cord or brachial plexus may be the cause. The onset of brachial plexus paralysis is usually explosive where pain is the initial feature. Pain localizes to the shoulder but may be more diffuse, or could be limited to the lower arm. Pain is severe and often described as sharp, stabbing, throbbing, or aching. The duration of pain, which is constant, varies from a span of several hours to 3 weeks. As the pain subsides, weakness usually appears. In addition, chronicle progressive weakness of one leg suggests a tumor of the spinal cord of the lumbar plexus. Fever is often the first symptom of lumbar plexus paralysis, followed by pain in one or both legs. The pain has an abrupt onset and may occur in a femoral or sciatic distribution. Weakness may develop concurrently with pain or be delayed for as long as 3 weeks. Furthermore, a monomeric form of spinal muscular atrophy, affecting only one leg or arm, should be considered when progressive weakness is not accompanied by sensory loss. \n\nSome potential causes of monoplegia are listed below.\n\n\nSpecifically, monoplegia in the lower extremities is typically caused by Brown Sequard syndrome and hematomas in the frontoparietal cortex near the middle that could produce a deficit such as this, but this is a very uncommon occurrence.\n\nIn monoplegia, the spine and the proximal portion of nerves are usually the abnormal sites of limb weakness. Monoplegia resulting from upper extremity impairments following a stroke occurs due to direct damage to the primary motor cortex, primary somatosensory cortex, secondary sensorimotor cortex, sensorimotor cortical areas, subcortical structures, and/or the corticospinal tract. It is often found that impairments following stroke are either caused by damage to the same or adjacent neurological structures. A combination of these impairments is more likely than just one in isolation. Damage to the corticospinal system results in an inability to activate muscles with enough force or in a coordinated manner, which can lead to paresis, loss of fractional movement, and abnormal muscle tone. Damage to the somatosensory cortical areas causes loss of somatosensation which results in an impaired ability to monitor movement.\n\nConsidering monoplegia as it relates to cerebral palsy, in premature infants, the most common cause of cerebral palsy is periventricular hemorrhagic infarction. In term infants, the underlying causes are often cerebral malformations, cerebral infarction, and intracerebral hemorrhage. Delayed crawling or walking are the usual concerns that arise in infants with paralysis of the limb. In these cases, abnormalities of the legs are the main focus of the attention.\n\nMonoplegia is diagnosed by a physician after a physical examination and sometimes after further neurologic examination as well. As monoplegia is fairly rare, after physical examination of a patient complaining of monoplegia, sometimes weakness of an additional limb is also identified and the patient is diagnosed with hemiplegia or paraplegia instead. After neurologic examination of the limb, a diagnosis of a monoplegic limb can be given if the patient receives a Medical Research Council power grade of 0, which is a measurement of the patient's limb strength. Needle Electromyography is often used to study all limbs, essentially showing the extent in each limb involvement. Furthermore, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is the diagnostic modality of choice for investigating all forms of hemiplegia. It is especially informative to show migrational defects in hemiplegic cerebral palsy associated with seizures. \n\nAn approach called single-pulse transcranial magnetic stimulation (spTMS) has also been used to help diagnose motor deficits such as monoplegia. This is done by evaluating the functional level of the corticospinal tract through stimulation of the corticospinal lesions in order to obtain neurophysiologic evidence on the integrity of the corticospinal tracts. Single-pulse transcranial magnetic stimulation provides neuropsychological feedback such as motor-evoked potentials (MEPs) and central motor conduction time (CMCT). This feedback can then be compared to the normal limits of patients who do not show evidence of deficits in the corticospinal tracts. \n\nThere is no cure for monoplegia, but treatments typically include physical therapy and counseling to help recover muscle tone and function. Recovery will vary depending on diagnosis of temporary, partial or complete paralysis. Much of the therapies focus on the upper limb due to the fact that monoplegia in the upper limbs is much more common than in the lower limbs. It has been found that intense activity-based and goal-directed therapy, such as constraint-induced movement therapy and bimanual therapy, are more effective than standard care. Studies suggest the less affected hand could provide a template for improving motor performance of the more affected hand, and provides a strong rationale for the development of bimanual training approaches. In addition to that, there is strong evidence to support that occupational therapy home programs that are goal-directed could be used to supplement hands-on direct therapy. \n\nConstraint-induced movement therapy (CIMT) is specifically targeted at upper limb monoplegia as a result of a stroke. In CIMT the unaffected arm is restrained, forcing the use and frequent practice of the affected arm. This approach to therapy is carried out during ordinary and daily activities by the affected person. It has been found that CIMT is more effective at specifically improving arm movement than a physiotherapy approach or no treatment at all. It should be noted, however, that this type of therapy has proved to provide an only moderate improvement in patients with monoplegia. More research needs to be conducted in order to establish the lasting benefit of constraint-induced movement therapy.\n\nBrain computer interface (BCI) systems have been proposed as a tool for rehabilitation of monoplegia, specifically in the upper limb after a stroke. BCI systems provide sensory feedback in the brain via functional electrical stimulation, virtual reality environments, or robotic systems, which allows for the use of brain signals.This is extremely crucial because the networking in the brain is often compromised after a stroke, leading to impaired movement or paralysis. BCI systems allow for detection of intention to move through the primary motor cortex, then provide the matched sensory stimulation according to feedback that is provided. This leads to activity-dependent plasticity within the user, requiring them to pay careful attention to tasks that require the activation or deactivation of specific brain areas. BCI systems utilize different sources of information for feedback, including electroencephalography (EEG), magnetoencephalography, functional magnetic resonance imaging, near-infrared spectroscopy, or electrocorticography. Among all of these, the EEG signals are the most useful for this type of rehabilitation because they are highly accurate and stable.\n\nAnother form of treatment for monoplegia is functional electrical stimulation (FES). It is targeted at patients who acquired monoplegia through incidents such as a spinal cord injury, stroke, multiple sclerosis, or cerebral palsy and utilizes electrical stimulation in order to cause the remaining motor units in the paralyzed muscles to contract. As in traditional muscular training, FES improves the force with which the unaffected muscles contract. For less severely affected patients, FES allows for greater improvement in range of motion than traditional physical therapy.\n"}

In this family the mutation was inherited as an autosomal recessive. It is not yet known if this gene is the cause of this disease in other families.\n\nThe gene encoding cytosolic phospholipase A2-α is found on chromosome 1. Cytosolic phospholipase A2-α acts on membrane phospholipids to release arachidonic acid a precursor in the synthesis of eicosanoids. The eicosanoids are involved in multiple regulatory pathways.\n\nThis disease is characterised by multifocal stenosing ulceration of the small intestine. The ulcers are circular or irregular in shape and their margins are always clear. The intervening mucosa appears normal.

Giant cells or other typical features of granulomatous inflammation are not found. Multiple stenoses are typically present (mean 8: range 1-25).\n\nThis may be difficult given the non specific nature of the presenting symptoms and the rarity of the condition itself. It is normally made by the combination of the clinical picture, endoscopic findings and typical histology. Radiology may also be helpful. Other conditions such as infections and vasculitis should be ruled out with the relevant laboratory investigations.\n\n\nSteroids seem to relieve the symptoms but long term treatment may be required.

This standard of excellence has been kept with years of research innovations leading to over multiple patents for scientific contributions and numerous publications in high-impact journals such as Science, Nature, the New England Journal of Medicine, and the Journal of the American Medical Association.\n\nThe United States Army Medical Research Unit - Europe (USAMRU-E), a subordinate command of the Walter Reed National Military Center, is currently located in Heidelberg, Germany. USAMRU-E conducts applied psychological research to protect, optimize, and enhance psychological resilience for military members while also studying factors that can impact current stressors on the unit as well as the individual and their family. USAMRU-E focuses on command-directed behavioral health assessments and the development and validation of resilience training for the deployment cycle and the professional military education system. At USAMRU-E, individuals are exposed to a wide range of stressors that can negatively impact their behavioral health and well-being. Approximately 20% of those exposed report significant behavioral health problems upon returning from a combat deployment.\n\nThe National Capital Consortium (NCC) Psychiatry Residency Program, which began in 1996, is unique and innovative graduate medical education program in psychiatry for military medical professionals. For over sixty years, neuropsychiatry investigators at the Walter Reed Army Institute of Research have worked to understand, prevent, and treat the poorly understood and untreated threats to military members health and performance that just \"in their head.\" Three military medical institutions, WRNMMC, Fort Belvoir Community Hospital (FBCH), and the Uniformed Services University of the Health Sciences (USUHS), are involved with this integrated psychiatry residency program while keeping the tradition of excellence in graduate medical education alive. NCC psychiatry residents consistently score among the highest in the nation on standard training examinations and a large number of graduates have gone on to become national and world leaders in psychiatry.\n\nThe National Capital Military Psychiatry Residency is a four-year program designed to prepare military physicians and nurses for the practice of general psychiatry in the military and in community settings upon discharge from the military. The program's mission is to train military physicians and nurses to become effective psychiatrists and psychiatric nurses in the variety of future roles they will fill, from military medical operations to multi-disciplinary mental health settings to primary care and other medical-surgical settings. Those who enroll in the psychiatric residency program apply their techniques of social science and psychiatric research to understand and address the many global and day-to-day pressures of military life affecting \"mental health\" and \"psychological resilience.\" Military psychiatry, psychotherapy, and psychopharmacology are particularly strong areas of emphasis of the program. Faculty members include nationally known leaders in a number of areas of psychiatry, including psychopharmacology, psychoanalysis, neuropsychiatry, child and adolescent psychiatry, consultation-liaison psychiatry, and military psychiatry.\n\nCombined residency training opportunities are also offered by the program. Army residents may apply for a 3+2 child psychiatry fellowship, and if accepted, may complete both general and child and adolescent psychiatry training in a total of five years. There is also a five-year combined internal medicine and psychiatry training program offered by the NCC Psychiatry and Internal Medicine Residency Programs. Graduates of this combined program complete requirements necessary for graduation from both residencies and for board certification in both general psychiatry and internal medicine. They also use traditional methods of individual and small-group interview, standard and specialized psychological tests and surveys, and objective measures such as the rates of suicide, re-enlistment, and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), to make wide-ranging assessments of slider and military family health and to recommend changes to organization, training, and leadership.\n"}
{"id": "34418537", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=34418537", "title": "Religious delusion", "text": "Religious delusion\n\nA religious delusion is any delusion involving religious themes or subject matter. Though a small minority of psychologists have characterized all or nearly all religion as delusion, others focus solely on a denial of any spiritual cause of symptoms exhibited by a patient and look for other answers relating to a chemical imbalance in the brain.\n\nIndividuals experiencing religious delusions are preoccupied with religious subjects that are not within the expected beliefs for an individual's background, including culture, education, and known experiences of religion. These preoccupations are incongruous with the mood of the subject. Falling within the definition also are delusions arising in psychotic depression; however, these must present within a major depressive episode and be congruous with mood.\n\nResearchers in a 2000 study found religious delusions to be unrelated to any specific set of diagnostic criteria, but correlated with demographic criteria, primarily age. In a comparative study sampling 313 patients, those with religious delusion were found to be aged older, and had been placed on a drug regime or started a treatment programme at an earlier stage. In the context of presentation, their global functioning was found to be worse than another group of patients without religious delusions. The first group also scored higher on the Scale for the Assessment of Positive Symptoms (SAPS), had a greater total on the Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale (BPRS), and were treated with a higher mean number of neuroleptic medications of differing types during their hospitalization.\n\nReligious delusion was found in 2007 to strongly correlate with \"temporolimbic overactivity\". This is a condition where irregularities in the brain's limbic system may present as symptoms of paranoid schizophrenia.\n\nIn a 2010 study, Swiss psychiatrists found religious delusions with themes of spiritual persecution by malevolent spirit-entities, control exerted over the person by spirit-entities, delusional experience of sin and guilt, or delusions of grandeur.\n\nReligious delusions have generally been found to be less stressful than other types of delusion. A study found adherents to new religious movements to have similar delusionary cognition, as rated by the Delusions Inventory, to a psychotic group, although the former reported feeling less distressed by their experiences than the latter.\n\nBehaviours out of the ordinary were traditionally viewed as demonic possession. These episodes, although entirely disavowed by modern psychiatry, are evaluated by clinicians only such that they fall within the safety of a treatment programme.\n\nEarlier propositions that religious shamans were motivated by delusions and that their behaviour resembled that of patients with schizophrenia were found to be incorrect.\n\nIn a 1937 essay, Sigmund Freud stated that he considered believing in a single god to be a delusion, thus extending his 1907 comment that religion is the indication of obsessional neurosis. His thoughts defining \"delusion\" perhaps crystallized from the notion of the religion formulations of the common man (\"circa\" 1927) as \"patently infantile, foreign to reality\"; around the same year he also stated that religion \"comprises a system of wishful illusions together with a disavowal of reality, such as we find in an isolated form nowhere else but amentia, in a state of blissful hallucinatory confusion\".\n\nExamples from a 295-subject study in Lithuania showed that the most common religious delusions were being a saint (in women) and being God (in men).\n\nIn one study of 193 people who had previously been admitted to hospital and subsequently diagnosed with schizophrenia, 24% were found to have religious delusions.\n\nA 1999 study identified that religious delusions were often present or expressed in persons with forensic committal to a psychiatric unit.\n\nAlthough many researchers have brought evidence for a positive role that religion plays in health, others have shown that religious practices and experiences may be linked to mental illnesses of various kind (mood disorders, personality disorders, psychiatric disorders). In 2011, a team of psychiatrists, behavioral psychologists, neurologists and neuropsychiatrists from the Harvard Medical School published a research which suggested the development of a new diagnostic category of psychiatric disorders related to religious delusion and hyperreligiosity.\n\nThey compared the thought and behavior of the most important figures in the Bible (Abraham, Moses, Jesus Christ and Paul) with patients affected by mental disorders related to the psychotic spectrum using different clusters of disorders and diagnostic criteria (DSM-IV-TR), and concluded that these Biblical figures \"may have had psychotic symptoms that contributed inspiration for their revelations\", such as schizophrenia, schizoaffective disorder, manic depression, delusional disorder, delusions of grandeur, auditory-visual hallucinations, paranoia, Geschwind syndrome (Paul especially) and abnormal experiences associated with temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE).\n\nIn 1998–2000 Pole Leszek Nowak (born 1962) from Poznań authored a study in which, based on his own history of religious delusions of mission and overvalued ideas, and information communicated in the Gospels, made an attempt at reconstructing Jesus′ psyche with the view of Jesus as apocalyptic prophet. He does so in chapters containing, in sequence, an analysis of character traits of the ″savior of mankind″, a description of the possible course of events from the period of Jesus' public activity, a naturalistic explanation of miracles.\n\nA religious experience of communication from heavenly or divine beings could be interpreted as a test of faith. An example of such is Joan of Arc, \"La Pucelle d'Orléans\", who rallied French forces late in the Hundred Years' War.\n\nDaniel Paul Schreber is an example of a supposed religious delusion occurring in a developed condition of psychosis. Schreber was a successful and highly respected German judge until middle age, when he came to believe that God was turning him into a woman. Two of his three illnesses (1884–1885 and 1893–1902) are described in his book \"Memoirs of My Nervous Illness\" (original German title \"Denkwürdigkeiten eines Nervenkranken\"), which became an influential book in the history of psychiatry and psychoanalysis thanks to its interpretation by Sigmund Freud.\n\nThe Harvard Medical School research also focused on social models of psychopathology, analyzing new religious movements and charismatic cult leaders such as David Koresh, leader of the Branch Davidians, and Marshall Applewhite, founder of the Heaven's Gate cult. The researchers concluded that \"If David Koresh and Marshall Applewhite are appreciated as having psychotic-spectrum beliefs, then the premise becomes untenable that the diagnosis of psychosis must rigidly rely upon an inability to maintain a social group. A subset of individuals with psychotic symptoms appears able to form intense social bonds and communities despite having an extremely distorted view of reality. The existence of a better socially functioning subset of individuals with psychotic-type symptoms is corroborated by research indicating that psychotic-like experiences, including both bizarre and non-bizarre delusion-like beliefs, are frequently found in the general population. This supports the idea that psychotic symptoms likely lie on a continuum.\"\n\nAn individual may hear communication from heavenly or divine beings compelling one to commit acts of violence. Some cite the case of the Hebrew patriarch Abraham, who was commanded by God to sacrifice his son Isaac. However, when Abraham was prepared to act on it, God informed him that this was only a test of faith and forbade any human sacrifice.\n\nIn contemporary times persons judged to have experienced auditory hallucination include those hearing voices instructing or motivating them to commit violent acts. These auditory experiences are classified by psychiatry as command hallucination. Persons acting to commit murder are reported as hearing voices of religious beings such as God, angels, or the Devil.\n\nWithin the anti-psychiatry community, Professor Thomas Szasz critiques the concept of religious auditory hallucination: those who hear the voice of God talking to them are experiencing schizophrenia, while those who talk to God but hear no response are simply praying.\n\n"}

{"id": "13327387", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=13327387", "title": "Rohrabacher–Farr amendment", "text": "Rohrabacher–Farr amendment\n\nThe Rohrabacher–Farr amendment (also known as the Rohrabacher–Blumenauer amendment) is legislation first introduced by U.S. Rep. Maurice Hinchey in 2001, prohibiting the Justice Department from spending funds to interfere with the implementation of state medical cannabis laws. It passed the House in May 2014 after six previously failed attempts, becoming law in December 2014 as part of an omnibus spending bill. The passage of the amendment was the first time either chamber of Congress had voted to protect medical cannabis patients, and is viewed as a historic victory for cannabis reform advocates at the federal level. The amendment does not change the legal status of cannabis however, and must be renewed each fiscal year in order to remain in effect.\n\nInitially introduced by Rep. Hinchey in 2001, the amendment was withdrawn before it could be brought to a vote. In 2003, Hinchey joined with Rep. Dana Rohrabacher to introduce the amendment, leading to a 152–273 defeat the first time the amendment was voted on. The Hinchey–Rohrabacher amendment failed five more times over the next decade, until it passed the House (as the Rohrabacher–Farr amendment) by a 219–189 vote on May 30, 2014, as an attachment to the Commerce, Justice, and Science Appropriations bill for fiscal year 2015. The amendment was then introduced in the Senate by Sens. Rand Paul and Cory Booker on June 18, but was not allowed a vote. In December, however, the amendment was inserted into the $1.1 trillion \"cromnibus\" spending bill as part of final negotiations, and the bill was signed into law by President Obama on December 16, 2014.\n\nThe Rohrabacher–Farr amendment passed the House for a second time on June 3, 2015, by a 242–186 margin. It was voted on by members of the Senate for the first time on June 11, 2015, winning approval in a 21–9 Senate Appropriations Committee vote led by sponsor Barbara Mikulski. The amendment remained in the FY 2016 omnibus appropriations bill that was signed into law by President Obama on December 18, 2015.\n\nThe Rohrabacher–Farr amendment was not voted on by the House in 2016, but did pass the Senate Appropriations Committee for a second time on April 21, 2016, by a 21–8 vote. The amendment was later renewed in a pair of spending bills signed into law on September 29 and December 10, and again for an additional week on April 28, 2017.\n\nOn May 5, 2017, the Rohrabacher–Farr amendment was renewed until September 30, 2017, as part of a $1 trillion spending bill signed into law by President Trump. In regards to the medical cannabis provision, Trump added a signing statement that read: \"Division B, section 537 provides that the Department of Justice may not use any funds to prevent implementation of medical marijuana laws by various States and territories. I will treat this provision consistently with my constitutional responsibility to take care that the laws be faithfully executed.\" Days before the spending bill was signed into law, Attorney General Jeff Sessions wrote to congressional leaders urging that the Rohrabacher–Farr amendment not be renewed.\n\nOn July 27, 2017, the Senate Appropriations Committee approved inclusion of the Rohrabacher–Farr amendment in the CJS appropriations bill for fiscal year 2018, in a voice vote led by sponsor Sen. Patrick Leahy. On September 6, however, the House Committee on Rules blocked a vote on the amendment, due to Republican leadership viewing it as too divisive. The amendment was then renewed on September 8 as part of an emergency aid package, and again through a series of stopgap spending bills on December 8, December 22, January 22, and February 9 (briefly expiring on January 20). On March 23, the amendment was renewed as part of an omnibus spending bill, in effect through September 30, 2018.\n\nOn May 17, 2018, the House Appropriations Committee approved inclusion of the Rohrabacher–Farr amendment in the CJS appropriations bill for fiscal year 2019, in a voice vote led by sponsor Rep. David Joyce. The Senate Appropriations Committee followed on June 12 by approving a base CJS appropriations bill with the amendment included. The amendment was then renewed through December 7 as part of a short-term spending bill signed on September 28.\n\nThe Rohrabacher–Farr amendment has been introduced on the House floor nine times. It was initially known as the Hinchey–Rohrabacher amendment until Rep. Hinchey retired in January 2013, after which Reps. Dana Rohrabacher and Sam Farr took over as lead sponsor and co-sponsor. In January 2017, Rep. Farr retired from Congress, with Rep. Earl Blumenauer taking over as future lead co-sponsor.\n\nThe vote totals for the amendment are as follows:\n\nThe passage of the Rohrabacher–Farr amendment in 2014 was noted for its rare bipartisan support, garnering the approval of 49 Republicans and 170 Democrats. Among the notable \"no\" votes was DNC Chair Debbie Wasserman Schultz, who was the only member of Democratic leadership to vote against it. The medical cannabis advocacy group Americans for Safe Access subsequently targeted Schultz with a TV ad criticizing her vote against the amendment.\n\nThe Rohrabacher–Farr amendment passed the House in 2015 with the support of 67 Republicans and 175 Democrats.\n\nThe full text of the 2014 House amendment is as follows:\n\nNone of the funds made available in this Act to the Department of Justice may be used, with respect to the States of Alabama, Alaska, Arizona, California, Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, District of Columbia, Florida, Hawaii, Illinois, Iowa, Kentucky, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, Mississippi, Missouri, Montana, Nevada, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New Mexico, Oregon, Rhode Island, South Carolina, Tennessee, Utah, Vermont, Washington, and Wisconsin, to prevent such States from implementing their own State laws that authorize the use, distribution, possession, or cultivation of medical marijuana.\n\nThe Rohrabacher–Farr amendment became law in December 2014, but initially failed to have its intended impact, due to the Justice Department interpreting the amendment in an incorrect manner (as later determined by a pair of court rulings). Contrary to the amendment's popular interpretation, the DOJ argued that only state officials were protected from prosecution, and not private individuals or entities involved in the production or distribution of medical cannabis. Since state officials were not being prosecuted to begin with, the DOJ's position was essentially that the amendment had no effect. This stance conflicted with the DOJ's earlier position (leading up to the May 2014 vote), when it advised members of Congress that the amendment's protections could actually apply more broadly than intended, to cover recreational cannabis as well (in addition to medical).\n\nAfter the amendment's enactment, the Justice Department continued to prosecute medical cannabis providers in accordance with the new interpretation. These actions consequently drew protests from Rohrabacher and others, who charged that both the letter and the spirit of the amendment were being violated. The DOJ publicly addressed the matter for the first time in April 2015, when a spokesperson confirmed the much more narrow interpretation of the amendment that was being employed. In response, both Rohrabacher and Farr strongly denounced the interpretation, and a letter was sent to Attorney General Eric Holder demanding an end to the prosecutions. A letter was also sent to Inspector General Michael Horowitz in July 2015, seeking a government investigation into the matter.\n\nIn October 2015, a court ruling by U.S. District Judge Charles Breyer affirmed the meaning of Rohrabacher–Farr as the authors originally intended, providing supporters of the amendment with a key legal victory. Judge Breyer in his decision was especially critical of the DOJ interpretation, stating that it \"defies language and logic\" and \"tortures the plain meaning of the statute\", and was \"counterintuitive and opportunistic\". The ruling lifted an injunction against a California dispensary, the Marin Alliance for Medical Marijuana, and was considered to set important legal precedent inhibiting future prosecutions. The Justice Department appealed Breyer's ruling, but in April 2016 it withdrew the appeal. In August 2016, the DOJ interpretation was rejected by the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals as well, in a separate case consolidating the appeals of 10 medical cannabis providers in the states of California and Washington. The unanimous ruling of the three-judge panel is binding on the nine western states of the Ninth Circuit, and is considered likely to hold influence on other circuit courts.\n\n"}

Where ergonomics is the study of how humans react to and physically fit with machines in their environment, technostress is a result of altered habits of work and collaboration that are being brought about due to the use of modern information technologies at office and home situations.\n\nPeople experience technostress when they cannot adapt to or cope with information technologies in a healthy manner. They feel compulsive about being connected and sharing constant updates, feel forced to respond to work-related information in real-time, and engage in almost habitual multi-tasking. They feel compelled to work faster because information flows faster, and have little time to spend on sustained thinking and creative analysis.\n\nCraig Brod, a leader in the field of technostress research, states that technostress is \"a modern disease of adaptation caused by an inability to cope with the new computer technologies in a healthy manner.\" Some of the earliest technostress scholarly studies in the field of Management Information Systems show that technostress is an undesirable phenomenon spawned by use of computing and communication devices such as computers, tablets and smartphones. It is dependent on gender, age and computer literacy. Women experience lower technostress than men, older people experience less technostress at work than younger people and those with greater computer literacy experience lower technostress.\n\nPsychological stress can manifest itself physically. Similarly there are a number of symptoms of technostress. One symptom of technostress is anxiety. Anxiety can appear as: irritability, headaches, backaches, eye strain, neck pain, stiff shoulder, joint pains, mental fatigue, depression, nightmares, panic, resistance, and a feeling of helplessness. The anxiety expressed by those experiencing technostress: insomnia, loss of temper, irritability, frustration and can increase errors in judgement and poor job performance if not dealt with.\n\nIn the 21st century, people equipped with technology at the workplace are most especially those experiencing technostress. People are sitting and facing computer monitors for a longer time which results in physical strain. In the 21st century work environment, people spend hours day at work because it is critical to their security and job satisfaction. However, these demands are becoming increasingly hazardous to their health. In a technological world, providing people with appropriate and safe physical environment is a necessity. Too much exposure to computer monitors is associated with emotional stress, and people are emotionally affected by technostress in their workplaces.\n\nConsequences of technostress include decreased job satisfaction, organizational commitment and productivity. A periodic assessment is necessary to check the level of technostress affecting professionals especially the physical and emotional aspects. Managers should organize technology-based trainings for employees to make them comfortable with technologies and awareness of their harmful effects. Technology skills for employees are important to consistently update their technological skills. Institutions, companies, and agencies are needed to employ IT specialists and troubleshooters to maximize system accessibility and provide a level of comfort to the employee.\n\nThe causes of technostress amount to:\n\nFour Aspects of Technostress:\n\n\nThere are five conditions that are classified as \"technostress creators\":\n\nTechnostress can be treated by getting user friendly software and educating people about new technology and creating better level of reassurance, patience and stability and communication within the job environment. Other option is avoid or restrict use of technology. \n\nWays to eliminate technostress are conducting stress management activities to lessen and eliminate the problem of technostress such as exercise, meditation, progressive muscle relaxation, positive self talk, staying healthy and having healthy diet. Taking frequent breaks from technology, having a schedule, counseling, having awareness of technostress, establishing a teamwork relationship with colleagues may help.\n\n\nGeneral\n\n"}

Diethylene glycol is a less-expensive alternative to glycerine for industrial applications, however, diethylene glycol is nephrotoxic and can result in multiple organ dysfunction syndrome (MODS), especially in children.\n\nThere were poisonings in Panama, China, Haiti, Bangladesh, Argentina, Nigeria, and India (twice) between 1992 and 2007, due to contaminated cough syrup and other medications that incorporated inexpensive diethylene glycol instead of the intended glycerin. In May 2007, 365 deaths were reported in Panama.\n\nIn Panama, the imported diethylene glycol came from a Chinese manufacturer, sold under the unfortunate name TD glycerine, which means 'glycerine substitute'. A Spanish middleman filling the customs declaration changed the name to glycerine.\n\nThe China Food and Drug Administration did not regard the toxic cough syrup scandal as being China's fault. The Chinese manufacturer exported the diethylene glycol under the name TD glycerine, but the Spanish middleman Aduanas Javier de Gracia changed the name to glycerine when he filled the customs declaration in Panama.\n\nDiscovering and tracing a toxic syrup to its source has been difficult for health care providers and governmental agencies due to difficult communication between the governments of developed countries and developing countries. For example, Dr. Michael L. Bennish, an American pediatrician who works in developing countries, had been volunteering in Bangladesh as a physician and had noticed a number of deaths that seemed to coincide with the distribution of the government-issued cough syrup. The government rebuffed his attempts at investigating the medication. In response, Dr. Bennish smuggled bottles of the syrup in his suitcase when returning to the United States, allowing pharmaceutical laboratories in Massachusetts to identify the poisonous diethylene glycol, which can appear very similar to the less dangerous glycerine. Dr. Bennish went on to author a 1995 article in the British Medical Journal about his experience, writing that, given the amount of medication prescribed, death tolls \"must [already] be in the tens of thousands.\"\n\n"}
{"id": "53434415", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=53434415", "title": "Vaginal steaming", "text": "Vaginal steaming\n\nVaginal steaming, sometimes shortened to V-steaming, and also known as yoni steaming, is an alternative health treatment whereby a woman squats or sits over steaming water containing herbs such as mugwort, rosemary, wormwood, and basil. It has been practiced in Africa (Mozambique, South Africa), Asia (Indonesia, Thailand), and Central America (among the Q'eqchi' people).\n\nIt has become a fad for women in the Western world. It is described in spas as an ancient Korean treatment for reproductive organ ailments and is claimed to have other benefits. There is no empirical evidence supporting any of these claims.\n\nAccording to a study on vaginal practices by the World Health Organization published in 2011, one of the ways in which women practice vaginal care is by \"Vaginal steaming or smoking: the 'steaming' or 'smoking' of the vagina, by sitting above a source of heat (fire, coals, hot rocks) on which water, herbs, or oils are placed to create steam or smoke\". For that study, over 4,000 women in Tete (Mozambique), KwaZulu-Natal (South Africa), Yogyakarta (Indonesia), and Chonburi (Thailand) were asked about their vaginal care. When it came to vaginal steaming/smoking, very different results were obtained, and very different reasons were given: in Chonburi, 67% of women reported having performed vaginal steaming or smoking, \"which they associated with maintaining wellness and feminine identity\", especially after having given birth (85.5%). In Tete, only 10% of women practiced steaming or smoking, \"mostly intended to enhance male sexual pleasure by causing vaginal tightening (64.1% of users) and drying (22.9%)\". In the two African locations, 37–38% of women said they practiced it to enhance \"male sexual pleasure\"; in the two Asian ones, 0% gave that answer. Conversely, of the Asian women 26% reported their \"feminine identity\" was a reason, compared to 0% of the African women.\n\nSide effect and potential dangers include: allergic reactions, second-degree burns if the steam is too close, and vaginal infections.\n\nVaginal steaming is marketed with pseudoscientific notions of \"balancing\" female hormones and \"revitalizing\" the uterus or vagina.\n\nIt is also claimed to: reduce the discomfort, bloating and tiredness associated with menstruation, regulate irregular menstrual cycles, treat yeast infections, decrease the menstrual blood flow, increase fertility, relieve symptoms of menopause, treat endometriosis, speed up the after-birth healing process. There is no evidence for any of those claims. \n\nIt is also marketed as \"cleaning\" the vagina, which it does not do, and which is not necessary.\n\nThe marketing and perception of vaginal steaming falls within a mix of ideologies including post-feminist, new age, and inherently sexist notions in which the female body is on the one hand a dirty, defective thing, yet one that a woman can \"optimize\" to become \"goddess-like\".\n"}

It is not used as fuel for heat generation.\n\nXylit is sometimes used for the production of potting soil and professional substrate for horticulture.\n\nBecause of its good mechanical characteristics, with more elasticity and robustness than wood, and its good filtering characteristics, Xylit is sometimes used as wood chips or water filtration for water filtration.\n\nIts unique structure, that allow nutrients and pollutants to fix on it, its high specific surface area (encouraging trickling filter development) and its exceptional longevity (30 years) allow to be used as a very high quality filter. It is used as filter media in some decentralized wastewater systems.\n\nIt has been proven in France that it could be turned in compost\n\n\n\nThis article is partially translated from German and French Wikipedia articles.\n"}
