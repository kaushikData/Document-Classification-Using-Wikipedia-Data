{"id": "2625515", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2625515", "title": "A2LL", "text": "A2LL\n\nA2LL is the abbreviation of the German social services and unemployment software system \"Arbeitslosengeld II – Leistungen zum Lebensunterhalt\" (Unemployment money II - subsistence payments). This eGovernment process was to help combine unemployment insurance and welfare, but has instead become one of the many difficulties associated with the Hartz IV reforms in Germany.\n\nA2LL was first developed by a consortium of T-Systems, the software division of the former German state telecommunications company, and ProSoz, with a team of 30 developers, in the town of Herten. The software, which was delivered late in the last quarter of 2004, went live on January 1, 2005. It is now only maintained by T-Systems, since ProSoz left the consortium in May 2005, allegedly due to being on the brink of bankruptcy, (according to the local paper \"Hertener Allgemeine\").\n\nThe software is used in the social services offices through a web browser interface using secure communication. Administrative changes are only possible by direct access to the system via intranet of the Bundesagentur für Arbeit - the social services agency responsible for administrating welfare.\n\nThe system is based on 16 servers with 4 processors each, all running Linux. A Tomcat servlet container defines the graphical user interface. A web services framework from the Systinet company, uses a server farm of approximately 200 Windows 2003 servers which run the application server developed by ProSoz. The application server was developed using Microsoft's (D)COM technology and uses an Informix 9.4x database running on a Solaris machine containing 80 CPUs and a 300 GB Cache-RAM.\n\nThe software was delivered to large German cities such as Cologne, Hamburg, Frankfurt and Berlin on October 18, 2004. Other towns followed on October 21, although only 20% of the end user stations were permitted to use the system, to keep it from going down. More and more stations were soon added to the system, but there were many problems with the extremely slow response and data entry times. Staff in the social services agencies had to work overtime to get as much data into the system as possible before the start.\n\nOn December 23, 2004, the system had 2.6 million households registered and the FINAS booking system was prepared to send out 1.3 billion euros to accounts across the nation on January 1.\n\nThe first major error was found during the first payment - account numbers which were shorter than the standard 10 digits were filled up with zeros on the end instead of the beginning (i.e., 1234567 became 1234567000 instead of the correct 0001234567). The banks could not process the payments and thus had to be credited to fragment accounts until they could be sorted out. Due to the massive number of mistakes, the banks had to invest much effort into locating the owners, and the government had to issue emergency cash so that people could buy food.\n\nAs a quick fix the system switched to printing checks (not normally used in German financial transactions), but since the field for the street name chosen was too small, many of the checks could not be delivered to the intended recipients.\n\nThe software house ProSoz, a wholly owed subsidiary of the city of Herten, was on the brink of bankruptcy and resigned from the consortium. T-Systems hired the programmers from the company.\n\nEven six months after the start of the system, there were many needed features of the system that could not be used. For example, neither an analysis of variance nor a list of persons who had received too much money could be printed. The printing of documents was not flexible enough to fit many local situations. New legal rules for deducting current income from small jobs could not be completed in time for the official start of the system on October 1, 2005.\n\nIn July 2005 it was discovered that the system could not cope with one-time payments, for example so that schoolchildren could purchase books; consequently, this feature was disabled entirely. A few days later it was discovered that the system was not registering people properly with their insurance companies, causing enormous administrative headaches for the insurance providers.\n\nIn September 2005 the German press reported that the system had been transferring 25 million euros too much per month to the insurance providers. This meant that they could not calculate the new, lower insurance rate that was mandated to save the government money. According to press reports, an expert committee had determined the software to be non-maintainable and non-adaptable and was considering a completely new software system, just 9 months after it had gone into operation.\n\n"}

They teach that religion \"combines an objective, nonarbitrary basis for public morality with respect for the dignity and autonomy of each individual\" and thus \"balances the need for public order with a respect for individual liberty.\"\n\nSince the time that the first president of the United States, George Washington, wrote a notable letter to the Religious Society of Friends (Quakers) affirming their right to conscientious objection with regard to war, \"the accommodationist position has been dominant in U.S. law and public culture\". It has also advocated by many social conservatives of many political orientations, such as Christian democratic political parties.\n\nAccommodationism stands in tension with the judicial interpretation of separation of church and state, and the constitutionality of various government practices with respect to religion is a topic of active debate. Both principles arise from interpretations of the Establishment Clause and the Free Exercise Clause in the First Amendment to the Constitution of the United States.\n\nHistorians Mark Noll and Luke E. Harlow write that accommodationism was the view held by the Founding Fathers of the United States:\n\nAlexis de Tocqueville noted that most Christian denominations produce similar political effects in society:\n\nIn light of this broad consensus, many political scientists have noted that religion legitimizes political authority. Accommodationism also opines that \"there is a common set of religiously based morals\" with values such as \"chastity, honesty, charity, and frugality [which are] ultimately regarded as having a religious basis, but are common to virtually all religious traditions\".\n\nRichard John Neuhaus likewise stated that religion provides a \"sacred canopy\" under which political activity can occur, stating:\n\nIn contrast to Tocqueville's view, different Christian denominations have taken opposing views on moral issues which have been the basis for law, such as slavery, contraception, abortion, Christianity and homosexuality, capital punishment, and war. Some of these disputes break down into the Christian right vs. Christian left. Christian libertarianism is directly opposed to the use of state power to support religious beliefs.\n\nAccommodationism advocates providing aid to parochial schools, school vouchers that provide tax credit for private/parochial schools, as well as nonsectarian school prayer, as long as these policies apply equally to all religious institutions and individuals. In contrast to those advocating laïcité, accommodationists view the expression of one's religious faith in the public sphere as a human right, such as the wearing of a cross necklace or headcovering, for example.\n\nIn the United States, religious-based federal holidays and observances, including the National Day of Prayer and Thanksgiving, as well as Christmas, exist based on accommodationist principles. Accommodationism also is seen in national anthem and the official motto of the United States, In God We Trust, as well as in the judicial oath So help me God. Notably, William O. Douglas, Associate Justice of the Supreme Court of the United States, sounded the \"clarion call for accommodation\" when he stated in his ruling:\nIn the United States, the Supreme Court of the United States ruled with an accommodationist outcome in \"Everson v. Board of Education\", \"Zorach v. Clauson\", \"McGowan v. Maryland\", \"Epperson v. Arkansas\", \"Board of Education v. Allen\", \"Walz v. Tax Commission of the City of New York\", \"Tilton v. Richardson\", \"Roemer v. Board of Public Works of Maryland\", \"CPERL v. Regan\", \"Widmar v. Vincent\", \"Larson v. Valente\", \"United States v. Lee\", \"Mueller v. Allen\", \"Marsh v. Chambers\", \"Lynch v. Donnelly\", \"Alamo Foundation v. Secretary of Labor\", \"Bowen v. Roy\", \"Witters v. Washington Department of Services for the Blind\", \"Goldman v. Weinberger\", \"Corp. of Presiding Bishop v. Amos\", \"Bowen v. Kendrick\", \"Employment Division v. Smith\", \"Hernandez v. Commissioner\", \"Jimmy Swaggart Ministries v. Board of Equalization of California\", \"Westside Community Board of Education v. Mergens\", \"Lamb's Chapel v. Center Moriches Union Free School District\", \"Zobrest v. Catalina Foothills School District\", \"Rosenberger v. University of Virginia\", \"Capitol Square Review & Advisory Board v. Pinette\", \"Agostini v. Felton\", \"City of Boerne v. Flores\", \"Mitchell v. Helms\", \"Good News Club v. Milford Central School\", \"Zelman v. Simmons-Harris\", \"Van Orden v. Perry\", and \"Hein v. Freedom From Religion Foundation\", among others.\n\nIn the United States, organizations that promote accommodationism include The Becket Fund for Religious Liberty, Foundation for Moral Law, Lord's Day Alliance, Alliance Defending Freedom, Christian Coalition, Woman's Christian Temperance Union, and the First Liberty Institute.\n\nSocially conservative political parties such as the Republican Party, Constitution Party, and American Solidarity Party espouse accommodationism.\n\nOrganizations that have argued against accommodationist policies in the United States include Americans United for Separation of Church and State, the Ayn Rand Institute, the Freedom From Religion Foundation, the Military Religious Freedom Foundation, People for the American Way, and the Secular Coalition for America.\n\n\n"}

He earned the Navy Cross for his actions commanding and serving as Chief of Staff for the Commander and Chief of the United States Asiatic Fleet during the World War. As Governor, he focused on reforming the island's education system. He modeled a new system after that of co-educational California, but also outlawed the speaking of the Chamorro language at schools in an effort to improve the English language skills of the local children. Most of his education reform took place in his first term.\n\nAlthouse was born in 1869 in Illinois. He died on May 17, 1954.

During his first term, he made significant changes to the Guamanian education system. In an effort to promote the spread of English among local children, he burned a large number of Chamorro-English dictionaries and banned the use of Chamorro in the classroom and on playgrounds. Do to a shortage of classrooms, classrooms were made co-educational. He based the new system on the educational system of California and demanded that teachers stick to a rigid syllabus. His second term took place from December 14, 1922, to August 4, 1923.\n"}

Wheeler (born December 23, 1964) is an American lawyer, former lobbyist and since July 9, 2018 Acting Administrator of the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). He previously worked in the law firm Faegre Baker Daniels, representing coal magnate Robert E. Murray and lobbying against the Obama Administration's environmental regulations. Wheeler served as chief counsel to the United States Senate Committee on Environment and Public Works and to the chairman U.S. Senator James Inhofe, prominent for his rejection of climate change. Wheeler is a critic of limits on greenhouse gas emissions and the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change.\n\nIn October 2017, Wheeler was nominated by President Donald Trump, renominated in January 2018 and confirmed as Deputy Administrator of the EPA in April 2018. On July 9, 2018, Wheeler became the Acting Administrator after the resignation of Scott Pruitt. On November 16, 2018, President Trump announced he would nominate Wheeler to serve as the EPA's permanent administrator.\n\nWheeler was born in Hamilton, Ohio on December 23, 1964. In 1987 he obtained a Bachelor of Arts in English and biology from Case Western Reserve University in Cleveland, Ohio and a Juris Doctor from the Washington University in St. Louis School of Law in 1990. In 1998, he completed a Master of Business Administration at George Mason University.\n\nWheeler's first job between 1991 and 1995 was as special assistant to the Information Management Division Director in the Environmental Protection Agency´s Office of Pollution Prevention and Toxics. working on toxic chemical, pollution prevention, and right-to-know issues. Wheeler received the Agency's Bronze Medal in 1993 and twice in 1994.\n\nFrom January 1995 until January 1997, Wheeler worked as Chief Counsel of Senator Jim Inhofe.\nIn 1997 Wheeler entered his first work in Congress as majority staff director at the US Senate Subcommittee on Clean Air, Climate Change, Wetlands, and Nuclear Safety, which Inhofe chaired until 2001; thereafter he was minority staff director under Chairman George Voinovich from 2001-2003.\nFrom 2003-2009 he was chief counsel at the Senate Committee on Environment and Public Works. During this time, he generally sought to reduce government regulations on industries that generate greenhouse gases. Senator James Inhofe was prominent for his rejection of climate change, and famously brought a snowball to the Senate as alleged proof that climate change was not real.\n\nDuring his time at the Senate, he was named by the \"National Journal\" as one of the Top Congressional Staff Leaders in 2005 and was a John C. Stennis Congressional Staff Fellow in the 106th Congress.\n\nSince 2009 Wheeler has been a lobbyist at the law firm Faegre Baker Daniels' energy and natural resources practice. Since 2009, he represented the coal producer Murray Energy, privately owned by Robert E. Murray, a supporter of President Trump. Murray Energy was Wheeler's best-paying client, paying more than $300,000 during the period 2009-2017. Wheeler lobbied against the Obama administration's climate regulations for power plants and also sought to persuade the Energy Department to subsidize coal plants. Wheeler set up a meeting between Murray and Energy Secretary Rick Perry in March 2017; at the meeting, Murray advocated for the rollback of environmental regulations and for protections for the coal industry. \n\nIn October 2017, Wheeler was nominated by President Donald Trump to become Deputy Administrator of the United States Environmental Protection Agency. His nomination was returned to the White House on January 3, 2018 as the Senate had adjourned at the end of 2017 without taking up the nomination (Senate Rule XXXI, paragraph 6.). His nomination was resubmitted and he was confirmed as Deputy Administrator of the EPA on April 12, 2018, by a mostly party-line vote of 53–45, which included three Democratic Senators: Joe Manchin, Heidi Heitkamp, and Joe Donnelly.\n\nSince being sworn in, Wheeler has had at least three meetings with former lobbying clients of his in a potential violation of the Trump administration's ethics pledge and the promises that Wheeler made during his confirmation hearing. \n\nScott Pruitt announced on July 5, 2018, he would be resigning effective July 6. He left Wheeler as the acting head of the agency. Later, on November 16, 2018, Wheeler was nominated to be Administrator of the EPA, after being deputy administrator for five months.\n\nAsked in November 2018 to name three policies by the Trump administration that had contributed to cleaner air, Wheeler struggled to answer and two of his three answers were rollbacks of Obama administration policies intended to curb climate change.\n\nWheeler publishes articles in the magazine \"Law360\". In 2010, he questioned the scientific rigor of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, expressing his impression that the positions of the organization were based more on political worldview than scientific facts. Asked if he accepted the scientific consensus on climate change during his confirmation hearings as Deputy Director of the EPA, Wheeler answered, \"I believe that man has an impact on the climate but what's not completely understood is what the impact is.\"\n\nWheeler is Chairman Emeritus of the National Energy Resources Organization. He is Vice President of the Washington Coal Club. He is a member of Indiana University School of Public and Environmental Affairs Technical Review Panel for the Energy Concentration.\n"}
{"id": "20686116", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=20686116", "title": "Anti-Ukrainian sentiment", "text": "Anti-Ukrainian sentiment\n\nAnti-Ukrainian sentiment or Ukrainophobia is animosity towards Ukrainians, Ukrainian culture, language or Ukraine as a nation.\n\nIn modern times, significant presence of Ukrainophobia may be distinguished in three geographical areas, where it differs by its roots and manifestation:\nHistorically, Ukrainian culture was oppressed in states which included the Ukrainian population: Russian Empire, Soviet Union and historical Polish states.\n\nModern scholars define two types of anti-Ukrainian sentiment. One is based on discrimination of Ukrainians based on their ethnic or cultural origin, a typical kind of xenophobia and racism. Another one is based on the conceptual rejection of Ukrainians, Ukrainian culture, and language as artificial and unnatural; at the turn of the 20th century, several authors supported an assertion that Ukrainian identity and language had been created artificially in order to undermine Russia. This argument has been promulgated by several conservative Russian authors.\n\nUkrainophobic stereotypes range from mockery to ascribing negative traits to the whole Ukrainian nation.\n\nThe rise and spread of Ukrainian self-awareness around the time of the Revolutions of 1848 produced an anti-Ukrainian sentiment within some layers of society within the Russian empire. In order to retard and control this movement, the use of Ukrainian language within the Russian empire was initially restricted by official government decrees such as the Valuev Circular and later banned by the Ems ukaz from any use in print (with the exception of reprinting of old documents). Popularly the anti-Ukrainian sentiment was promulgated by such organizations as the \"Black Hundreds\", which were vehemently opposed to Ukrainian self-determination. Some restrictions on the use of Ukrainian language were relaxed in 1905–1907. They ceased to be policed after the February Revolution in 1917.\n\nBeside the Ems ukaz and Valuev Circular, there were a multiple number of other anti-Ukrainian edicts starting from the 17th century, when Russia was governed by the House of Romanov. In 1720 Peter the Great issued an edict prohibiting printing books in the Ukrainian language, and since 1729 all edicts and instructions have only been in the Russian language. In 1763 Catherine the Great issued an edict prohibiting lectures in the Ukrainian language at the Kiev-Mohyla Academy. In 1769 the Most Holy Synod prohibited printing and using the Ukrainian alphabet book. In 1775 the Zaporizhian Sich was destroyed. In 1832 all studying at schools of the Right-bank Ukraine transitioned to exclusively Russian language. In 1847 the Russian government persecuted all members of the Brotherhood of Saints Cyril and Methodius and prohibited the works of Taras Shevchenko, Panteleimon Kulish, Nikolay Kostomarov (Mykola Kostomarov) and others. In 1862 all free Sunday schools for adults in Ukraine were closed. In 1863 the Russian Minister of Interior Valuev decided that the Little Russian language (Ukrainian language) had never existed and could not ever exist. During that time in the winter of 1863–64, the January Uprising took place at the western regions of the Russian Empire, uniting peoples of the former Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth. Next year in 1864 the \"Regulation about elementary school\" claimed that all teaching should be conducted in the Russian language. In 1879 the Russian Minister of Education Dmitry Tolstoy (later the Russian Minister of Interior) officially and openly stated that all people of the Russian Empire should be Russified. In the 1880s several edicts were issued prohibiting education in the Ukrainian language at private schools, theatric performances in Ukrainian, any use of Ukrainian in official institutions, and christening Ukrainian names. In 1892 another edict prohibited translation from the Russian to Ukrainian. In 1895 the Main Administration of Publishing prohibited printing children books in Ukrainian. In 1911 the resolution adopted at the 7th Congress of Noblemen in Moscow prohibited the use of any languages other than Russian. In 1914 the Russian government officially prohibited celebrations of the 100th Anniversary of Shevchenko's birthday and posted gendarmes at the Chernecha Hill. The same year Nicholas II of Russia issued an edict prohibiting the Ukrainian press.\n\nUnder Soviet rule in Ukraine, a policy of korenization was adopted after defeat of the Ukrainian People's Republic and initially supported Ukrainian cultural self-awareness. This policy was phased out in 1928 and terminated entirely in 1932 in favor of general Russification.\n\nIn 1929 Mykola Kulish wrote a theatrical play \"Myna Mazailo\" where the author cleverly displays the cultural situation in Ukraine. There was supposedly no anti-Ukrainian sentiment within the Soviet government, which began to repress all aspects of Ukrainian culture and language contrary to the ideology of Proletarian Internationalism.\n\nIn 1930 the Union for the Freedom of Ukraine process took place in Kharkiv, after which a number of former Ukrainian politicians and their relatives were deported to Central Asia. The ethnic cleansing against the Ukrainian intelligentsia was never evaluated and is poorly documented. The contemporary historical reevaluations of that period are viewed as hostile by the leadership of the Russian Federation, or at the very least as unfriendly.\n\nDuring the Soviet era, the population of Ukraine was reduced by the artificial famine called Holodomor in 1932–33 along with the population of other nearby agrarian areas of the USSR.\n\nMany prominent Ukrainians were labelled as nationalists or anti-revolutionaries, and many were repressed and executed as \"enemies of the people\".\n\nIn January 1944 during a session of Politbureau of the Central Committee of the All-Union Communist Party (Bolsheviks), Stalin personally gave a speech \"About anti-Lenin mistakes and nationalistic perversions in a film-tale of Alexander Dovzhenko \"Ukraine in flames\".\n\nOn July 2, 1951 the Communist newspaper Pravda published an article \"On Ideological Perversions in Literature\" in regards of the Volodymyr Sosyura's poem \"Love Ukraine\" where it stated the following: \"This poem could have been signed by such foes of the Ukrainian people as Petliura and Bandera ... For Sosiura writes about Ukraine and the love of it outside the limits of time and space. This is an ideologically vicious work. Contrary to the truth of life, the poet sings praises of a certain ‘eternal’ Ukraine full of flowers, curly willows, birds, and waves on the Dnipro.\"\n\nThe biggest film studio of Ukraine, Dovzhenko Film Studios (Kiev), explicitly shows the Soviet language policy of Russification even during the so-called policy of \"korenizatsiya\". A simple analysis of all studio productions which accounts for some 378 films shows that 338 films (88.9%) were produced either completely in the Russian language or the Ukrainian language could be heard in few episodes or in folkloristic scenes (such as songs) to distinct Ukrainian region. Only 22 (5.8%) films were produced in the Ukrainian language and language production of another 14 (3.7%) films was difficult to evaluate, while 6 (1.6%) films were really bilingual (Russian-Ukrainian).\n\nNumerous publications have been written about Russification by a number of academics and literary specialists such as Nina Virchenko, Rostyslav Dotsenko, Mykhailyna Kotsiubynska (niece of Mykhailo Kotsiubynsky), and many others.\n\nOn Sunday July 15, 2012 the national television broadcasting station in Ukraine First National in its news program \"Weekly overview\" () showed a video footage on a development of anti-Ukrainian sentiments within Ukraine.\n\nA propaganda article posted on the website of the Kremenchuk department of the Communist Party of Ukraine argues that history that was published during the Soviet regime was the true history, and that new historical facts being uncovered from the archives are false. The article also denies the existence of the Ukrainian culture.\n\nMykola Levchenko, a Ukrainian parliamentarian from Party of Regions, and the deputy of Donetsk City Council states that there should be only one language, Russian. He says that the Ukrainian language is impractical and should be avoided. Levchenko called Ukrainian the language of folklore and anecdotes. However, he says he will speak the literary Ukrainian language on principle, once Russian is adopted as the sole state language. Anna German, the spokesperson of the same party, highly criticized those statements.\n\nMykhailo Bakharev, the vice-speaker of the Crimean Autonomous Republic parliament (and the main editor of Krymskaya Pravda), openly says that there is no Ukrainian language and that it is the language of the non-educated part of population. He claims that it was invented by Taras Shevchenko and others. He also believes that there is no Ukraine nation, there is no future for the Ukrainian State, and that Ukrainization needs to be stopped.\n\nOn May 25, 2013 a resident of Kiev was beaten up simply for speaking in the Ukrainian language.\n\nThe former Ukrainian Minister of Science and Education, Dmytro Tabachnyk, sparked protests calling him anti-Ukrainian in some parts of Ukraine due to this statements about Western Ukrainians, his preference for the Russian language, and his denial of the Holodomor. Tabachnyk's view of Ukraine’s history includes the thesis that western Ukrainians aren’t really Ukrainian. In an article for the Russian newspaper \"Izvestia\" Tabachnyk wrote last year: “Halychany (western Ukrainians) practically don’t have anything in common with the people of Great Ukraine, not in mentality, not in religion, not in linguistics, not in the political arena” “We have different enemies and different allies. Furthermore, our allies and even brothers are their enemies, and their ‘heroes’ (Stepan Bandera, Roman Shukhevych) for us are killers, traitors and abettors of Hitler’s executioners.” By March 17, 2010 four of western Ukraine’s regional councils had passed resolutions calling for the minister’s dismissal. A host of civic and student organizations from all over the country (including Kherson in southern Ukraine and Donetsk in eastern Ukraine), authors and former Soviet dissidents also signed petitions calling for his removal. Tabachnik also had stated that Ukrainian history textbooks contained \"simply false\" information and announced his intention to rewrite them.\n\nIvan Dziuba in his lecture \"Shevchenkophobia in Modern Ukraine\" (\"Шевченкофобія в сучасній Україні\") traced the origins of the anti-Shevchenko sentiment and stated that the fight with Shevchenko is in fact the fight with Ukraine.\n\nOles Buzina was described as Shevchenkophobe for his essay \"\" (\"Вурдалак Тарас Шевченко\".) Ivan Dziuba called Buzina the \"pioneer of modern Shevchenkophobia\".\n\nIn a poll held by Levada Center in June 2009 in Russia 75% of Russian respondents respected Ukrainians as ethnic group but 55% were negative about Ukraine as the state. In May 2009, 96% of Ukrainians polled by Kyiv International Sociology Institute were positive about Russians as ethnic group, 93% respected Russian Federation and 76% respected Russian establishment.\n\nSome Russian media seem to try to discredit Ukraine. Media like Komsomolskaya Pravda seem to try to intensify the bad relationship between Ukraine and Russia. Anti-Ukrainian attitude persists among several Russian politicians, such as the former mayor of Moscow, Yuri Luzhkov, and the leader of the Liberal Democratic Party of Russia and the Deputy Speaker of the Russian Parliament, Vladimir Zhirinovsky.\n\nUkrainians form the third largest ethnic group in Russian Federation after Russians and Tatars. In 2006, in letters to Vladimir Putin, Viktor Yushchenko and Vasily Duma, the Ukrainian Cultural Centre of Bashkortostan complained of anti-Ukrainian sentiment in Russia, which they claim includes wide use of anti-Ukrainian ethnic slurs in the mainstream Russian media, television and film. The Urals Association of Ukrainians also made a similar complaint in a letter they addressed to the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe in 2000.\n\nAccording to the Ukrainian Cultural Centre of Bashkortostan, despite their significant presence in Russia, Ukrainians in that country have less access to Ukrainian-language schools and Ukrainian churches than do other ethnic groups. In Vladivostok, according to the head of the Ukrainian government's department of Ukrainian Diaspora Affairs, local Russian officials banned a Ukrainian Sunday school in order not to \"accentuate national issues\"\n\nAccording to the president of the Ukrainian World Congress in 2001, persistent requests to register a Ukrainian Orthodox Church - Kiev Patriarchate or a Ukrainian Catholic Church were hampered due to \"particular discrimination\" against them, while other Catholic, Muslim and Jewish denominations fared much better. According to the Ukrainian Greek Catholic Church, by 2007 their denomination had only one church building in all of Russia.\n\nIn 2008 Nikolai Smirnov released a documentary in which he claims that Ukraine is part of one whole Russia that was split away by different western powers such as Poland, particularly.\n\nIn November 2010, the High Court of Russia cancelled registration of one of the biggest civic communities of the Ukrainian minority, the \"Federal nation-cultural autonomy of the Ukrainians in Russia\" (FNCAUR). According to the author Mykhailo Ratushniy Ukrainian activists continue to face discrimination and bigotry in much of Russia.\n\nThe anchorman of a news program \"Sunday Time\" on the Channel One (Russia) Pyotr Tolstoi announced on July 8, 2012 about the enforced Ukrainization in Ukraine, 20 millions Russians, an invented genocide about Ukrainians, and the distortion of the Russian historiography.\n\nPolish anti-Ukrainian sentiment dates back to the aftermath of the Second World War, during which many Orthodox Christian Ukrainians enthusiastically collaborated with the Nazis. Some, including John Demjanjuk, worked as Nazi concentration camp guards or Trawniki men Hilfswilliger, others committed atrocities against civilians as members of the Ukrainian Insurgent Army, and many more spontaneously massacred their Jewish and Polish neighbours when the Germans invaded.\n\nIn late 1995, Ukrainian organization \"ZUwP\" was demanded to be banned following the wave of anti-Ukrainian actions that have erupted during the festival of Ukrainian culture in Poland in the border town of Przemyśl in 1995 where numerous threats against participants and numerous acts of vandalism took place. A rise in incidences of graffiti with anti-Ukrainian slogans, and the office of \"Związek Ukraińców w Polsce\" was set alight. In some cities anti-Ukrainian assaults, vandalism acts of an organized character have targeted centers of Ukrainian culture, schools, churches, memorials.\n\nUkrainophobic and antisemitic authors (mainly interbellum \"Endecja\" activists) published by Polish publishing house Nortom include: Roman Dmowski, Janusz Dobrosz, Jędrzej Giertych, Jan Ludwik Popławski, Maciej Giertych, Stanisław Jastrzębski, Edward Prus, Feliks Koneczny. In 2000, Nortom was forced to withdraw its 12 controversial titles from the Frankfurt Book Fair by the Polish Ministry of Culture representative Andrzej Nowakowski overlooking the Polish exposition. Nortom was accused of selling anti-German, anti-Ukrainian and antisemitic books, especially the following titles: \"Być czy nie być\" by Stanisław Bełza, \"Polska i Niemcy\" by Jędrzej Giertych and \"I tak nie przemogą. Antykościół, antypolonizm, masoneria\" by his son Maciej Giertych. As a result of the above request, the president of the Polish delegation Andrzej Chrzanowski from Polska Izba Książki decided to penalize Nortom by removing it from the 2000 book fair altogether.\n\nAnti-Ukrainian discrimination was present in Canada from the arrival of Ukrainians in Canada around 1891 until the late 20th Century. In one sense this was part of a larger trend towards nativism in English Canada during the period. But Ukrainians were singled out for special discrimination because of their large numbers, visibility (due to dress and language), and political activism. During the First World War, around 8,000 Ukrainian Canadian were interned by the Canadian government as \"enemy aliens\" (because they came from the Austrian Empire). In the interwar period all Ukrainian cultural and political groups, no matter what their ideology was, were monitored by the Royal Canadian Mounted Police and many of their leaders were deported.\n\nThis attitude began to slowly change after the Second World War, as Canadian immigration and cultural policies generally moved from being explicitly pro-British to a more pluralistic foundation. Ukrainian nationalists were now seen as victims of communism, rather than dangerous subversives. Ukrainians began to hold high offices, and one, Senator Paul Yuzyk was one of the earliest proponents of a policy of \"multiculturalism\" which would end official discrimination and acknowledge the contribution of non-English, non-French Canadians. The Royal Commission on Bilingualism and Biculturalism of the 1960s, which had originally been formed only to deal with French-Canadian grievances, began the transition to multiculturalism in Canada because of Prime Minister Pierre Trudeau's desire to court Ukrainian votes in Western Canada. The Commission also included a Ukrainian commissioner, Jaroslav Rudnyckyj.\n\nSince the adoption of official multiculturalism under Section Twenty-seven of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms in 1982, Ukrainians in Canada have had legal protection against discrimination.\n\nThe use of ethnic slurs and stereotypes in relation to Ukrainians in Russian media is one of Ukrainian community's concerns in Russia.\n\n\nThere are a number of Russian insults based on the alleged opposition of all Ukrainians to all things Russian (or all things Soviet, in the past)\n\n\n\n\n"}

In 1719 he married Maria Josepha, daughter of the Holy Roman emperor Joseph I and became elector of Saxony on his father's death in 1733. As a candidate for the Polish crown, he secured the support of the emperor Charles VI by assenting to the Pragmatic Sanction of 1713, designed to preserve the integrity of the Habsburg inheritance, and that of the Russian empress Anna by supporting Russia's claim to Courland. Chosen king by a small minority of electors on 5 October 1733, he drove his rival, the former Polish king Stanisław I, into exile. He was crowned in Kraków on 17 January 1734, and was generally recognised as king in Warsaw in June 1736.\n\nAugustus gave Saxon support to Austria against Prussia in the War of the Austrian Succession (1742) and again in the Seven Years’ War (1756), both of which resulted in Saxony being occupied by Prussia. His last years were marked by the increasing influence of the Czartoryski and Poniatowski families, and by the intervention of Catherine the Great in Polish affairs. His rule deepened the anarchy in Poland and increased the country's dependence on its neighbours. The Russian Empire, which had assisted him in his bid to succeed his father, prevented him from installing his family on the Polish throne, supporting instead the aristocrat Stanisław August Poniatowski. During his reign, Augustus spent little time in Poland and more interested in ease and pleasure than in affairs of state, this notable patron of the arts left the administration of Saxony and Poland to his chief adviser, Heinrich von Brühl, who in turn left Polish administration chiefly to the powerful Czartoryski family.\n\nThe reign of Augustus witnessed one of the greatest periods of disorder in Polish history.\n\nRoyal titles in \n\nEnglish translation: \"August III, by the grace of God, King of Poland, Grand Duke of Lithuania, Ruthenia (i.e. Galicia), Prussia, Masovia, Samogitia, Kiev, Volhynia, Podolia, Podlaskie, Livonia, Smolensk, Severia, Chernihiv, and also hereditary Duke of Saxony and Prince-elector.\"\n\nAugustus was the only legitimate son of Augustus II the Strong, Prince-Elector of Saxony and king of the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth who belonged to the Albertine line of the House of Wettin. His mother was Christiane Eberhardine of Brandenburg-Bayreuth. Groomed to succeed his father as king of Poland, Augustus converted to Catholicism in 1712; when publicly announced, this caused discontent among the Protestant Saxon aristocracy. Faced with a hereditary Catholic succession for Saxony, Prussia and Hanover attempted to oust Saxony from the directorship of the Protestant body in the Reichstag, but Saxony managed to retain the directorship.\nUpon the death of Augustus II in 1733, Augustus inherited the Saxon electorate and was elected to the Polish throne, with the support of the Russian Empire and the Holy Roman Empire. He was opposed by the forces of Stanisław I Leszczyński, who had usurped the throne with Swedish support during the Great Northern War. Reigning from 1706 until 1709, Stanisław was overthrown after the Swedish defeat at Poltava. Returning from exile in 1733 with the support of Louis XV of France, Stanisław sparked the War of the Polish Succession, which concluded in 1738 with a victory for Augustus's Russian and Imperial allies.\n\nAs King, Augustus was uninterested in the affairs of his Polish–Lithuanian dominion, focusing instead on hunting, the opera, and the collection of artwork (see Gemäldegalerie Alte Meister). He spent less than three years of his thirty-year reign in Poland, where political feuding between the House of Czartoryski and the Potocki paralysed the Sejm (Liberum Veto), fostering internal political anarchy and weakening the Commonwealth. Augustus delegated most of his powers and responsibilities in the Commonwealth to Heinrich von Brühl, who served in effect as the viceroy of Poland.\n\nAugustus's eldest surviving son, Frederick Christian of Saxony, succeeded his father as Elector. A Russian-supported coup d'état in Poland, instigated by the Czartoryskis, resulted in the election of Stanisław August Poniatowski as king of Poland and Grand Duke of Lithuania on 7 September 1764. Reigning under the name Stanisław II, Poniatowski was the son of the elder Stanisław Poniatowski, a powerful Polish noble and a onetime agent of Stanisław I; he was a lover of Catherine II of Russia and as such enjoyed strong support from that Empress's court.\n\nAugust was portrayed by Ernst Dernburg in the 1941 film \"Friedemann Bach\".\n\nIn Dresden on 20 August 1719, Augustus married Archduchess Maria Josepha of Austria, the eldest child of Joseph I, the Holy Roman Emperor. They had sixteen children:\n\nIn 1733, the composer Johann Sebastian Bach dedicated the Mass for the Dresden court (Kyrie and Gloria of what would later become his Mass in B Minor) to Augustus in honor of his succession to the Saxon electorate, with the hope of appointment as Court Composer, a title Bach received three years later. Bach's title of 'Koeniglicher Pohlnischer Hoff Compositeur' ('Royal Polish Court Composer,' and court composer to the Kurfuerst of Saxony) is engraved on the title page of Bach's famous Goldberg Variations.\n\n"}

Studying the use of austerity around the world up to the early 2010s and tracing its intellectual lineage, Blyth argues that the case for increasing economic growth through austerity is overstated, is counterproductive when implemented during recessions, and has exacerbated the Eurozone crisis. \"Austerity\" was selected among the \"Best Books of 2013\" by reviews in the \"Financial Times\" and \"Bloomberg News\".\n\nMark Blyth is the Eastman Professor of Political Economy and Professor of Political Science and International and Public Affairs at Brown University's Watson Institute for International and Public Affairs. He wrote \"Austerity\" in the aftermath of the Great Recession following the G20s' turn in mid-2010 away from Keynesian fiscal stimulus and towards fiscal consolidation and austerity.\n\nBlyth begins by reviewing the arguments in favour of austerity, namely an increase in business confidence and consequent investment due to less crowding out of private sector debt by government debt and a lower risk of default and the inefficiency of public spending due to small fiscal multipliers. While Blyth acknowledges that countries cannot solve the problem of high public debt through further borrowing, he highlights that it is impossible for countries in a globalized economy to increase economic growth by simultaneously cutting public spending. Exploring the rationale for austerity in the 2010s, he traces the built-up of public debt in the U.S. and European countries back to governments' bailouts of the financial sector during and after the financial crisis of 2007-2008 and the use of countercyclical policies in the Great Recession, in contrast to austerity advocates' narrative of governmental profligacy (with the exception of Greece). With regard to the European debt crisis, Blyth explains how the institutional setup of the Eurozone - in particular the ECB's narrow focus on inflation control, countries' inability to individually devalue their currencies after the adoption of the euro, and the financial sector's overleveraging - created a situation in which solvent North European countries were unwilling to financially support already highly indebted South European countries without the latter's commitment to austerity because of moral hazard.\n\nThereafter, Blyth goes on to trace austerity's origins to classical economists' (Locke, Hume, Smith) negative view of government debt, its translation into liquidationism in the U.S. (Schumpeter) and into the Treasury view in the United Kingdom, and the intellectual dominance of Keynesian deficit spending over austerity in the wake of the Great Depression. He then describes how the doctrine of austerity survived intellectually within Germany's ordoliberalism due to its lack of emphasis on business cycle management as well as within the Austrian School of Economics in the U.S. (Mises, Hayek, Rothbard), how the displacement of Keynesianism by monetarism (Friedman) focused macroeconomic policy on inflation control through central bank independence and dismissed unemployment as voluntary, and how the public choice school's theory of political business cycles (Buchanan, Stigler) criticized the negative role of democracy for fiscal stability, thereby setting the stage for a revival of austerity in the form of the IMF's structural adjustment programmes. Blyth also explains the intellectual genesis of the theory of expansionary fiscal contraction at the hands of Alesina, Tabellini, Ardagna, and Perotti. Turning towards austerity's empirical record between 1914 and 2012, Blyth critically investigates the effectiveness of austerity in the interwar period, emphasizing the role of austerity in the rise of fascism, and dismisses the case studies from the 1980s and early 2000s (mostly Baltic and Eastern European countries) typically advanced by austerity advocates on various grounds. Finally, comparing Ireland's 2008 bank bailout with Iceland's 2009 default, Blyth questions whether the financial sector is worth saving and suggests financial repression and more progressive taxation as alternatives to austerity with regard to reducing governments' public debt.\n\nOverall, \"Austerity\" received mixed to positive reviews. Writing in the \"New York Review of Books\", Paul Krugman praises \"Austerity\" for its account of the academic genesis of the theory of expansionary fiscal contraction. By contrast, while calling Blyth's description and criticism of austerity \"valid and compelling\" and his views on the Eurozone Debt Crisis \"cogent\", Lawrence Summers criticizes Blyth for dismissing austerity summarily, e.g. ignoring the success of U.S.-American and Canadian non-recessionary fiscal consolidations in the 1990s, and Blyth acceptance of a meltdown of the financial system. Finally, \"Austerity\" has been cited by austerity critics in a broad variety of media, e.g. by Larry Elliott in \"The Guardian\".\n\n\"Austerity\" was selected among the \"Best Books of 2013\" by reviews in the \"Financial Times\" and \"Bloomberg News\".\n\n"}

She began using the names Bo Laurent and Cheryl Chase simultaneously in the 1990s and changed her name legally from Bonnie Sullivan to Bo Laurent in 1995.\n\nChase was born in New Jersey with ambiguous genitalia that baffled doctors. According to \"The New York Times\", her parents originally named her Brian Sullivan, noting that \"Chase is XX, and the reason for her intersex condition has never been fully understood.\" Other sources state her original name was Charlie, since until recently Chase preferred to use pseudonyms when referring to her early life.\n\nChase told \"Salon\" she was born with \"mixed male/female sex organs\" and after the discovery of ovaries and a uterus, a clitoridectomy was performed to remove her larger clitoris when she was aged 18 months. Her parents, as advised by doctors, moved to a new town and raised her as a girl, Bonnie Sullivan. Although she had begun speaking before the operation, she fell silent for six months afterwards.\n\nShe told \"Salon\" that she developed ovotestis at age 8 (later clarified as \"the testicular part of her ovo-testes\").\nShe found out about the clitoridectomy aged 10, and at age 21 succeeded in gaining access to her medical records (some sources say this occurred in her early thirties).\n\nChase graduated from MIT with a B.S. in mathematics in 1983. She then studied Japanese at Harvard Extension School and at Middlebury College’s Intensive Summer Language Institute. In 1985, Chase was working as a graphic designer. She then moved to Japan as a visiting scholar at Hiroshima University. She later started a computer software firm near Tokyo. While in Japan, she also did translation work. \"I was good at all the hard stuff, the non-emotional stuff that’s considered more masculine.\" Upon return to the United States, Chase began working as an intersex activist. In 2008, Chase received a M.A. in organization development from Sonoma State University.\n\nChase had a \"nervous breakdown\" in her mid-30s. She told \"Salon\" she once contemplated committing suicide \"in front of the mutilating physician who had rendered her genitalia numb and scarred.\" When she was 35, Chase returned to the U.S. and badgered her mother for answers, then embarked on a search for a fuller understanding of what she had learned. Chase contacted many academic researchers and people with personal experiences of intersex conditions. In 1993, via a letter to the editor published in \"The Sciences\" July/August issue, she founded the now-defunct Intersex Society of North America (ISNA) by fiat and asked for people to write to her under her new name, Cheryl Chase, the beginning of the movement to protect the human rights of people born with intersex conditions in the U.S. In the 1990s, she began using the names Bo Laurent and Cheryl Chase simultaneously, sometimes in the same publication. She is the creator of \"Hermaphrodites Speak!\" (1995), a 30-minute documentary film in which several intersex people discuss the psychological impact of their conditions and the medical treatment and parenting they received, and the editor of the journal \"Hermaphrodites with Attitude\".\n\nIn 1998 Chase wrote an amicus brief for the Colombian constitutional court, which was then considering a ruling on surgery for a six-year-old boy with a micropenis. In 2004, Chase and the ISNA persuaded the San Francisco Human Rights Commission to hold hearings on medical procedures for intersex infants. Chase has published commentaries in medical journals and has criticized feminist writers, including Alice Walker and Katha Pollitt, for not putting intersexuality on the feminist agenda, despite their condemnation of female genital cutting in Africa and elsewhere. ISNA was honored with the International Gay and Lesbian Human Rights Commission's 2000 Felipa de Souza Human Rights Award.\n\nChase’s activism was a factor in the urology and endocrinology disciplines’ reopening of their consideration of intersex conditions. Chase advocates a more complex view of intersexuality: in particular, that difficulties cannot be eliminated by early genital surgery. In August 2006, \"Pediatrics\" published a letter signed by 50 international experts, including Chase, titled \"Consensus Statement on the Management of Intersex Disorders\". The statement, however, does not discourage surgical interventions, but did emphasize caution.\n\nIn 2017, Chase took part in the launch of a report by Human Rights Watch and interACT on medically unnecessary surgeries on intersex children, “I Want to Be Like Nature Made Me”, based on interviews with intersex persons, families and physicians. The report found that intersex medical interventions persist as default advice from doctors to parents, despite some change in some regions of the U.S. and claims of improved surgical techniques, resulting in an uneven situation where care differs and a lack of standards of care, but paradigms for care are still based on socio-cultural factors including expectations of \"normality\" and evidence in support of surgeries remains lacking. \"Nearly every parent\" in the study reported pressure for their children to undergo surgery, and many reported misinformation. The report calls for a ban on \"surgical procedures that seek to alter the gonads, genitals, or internal sex organs of children with atypical sex characteristics too young to participate in the decision, when those procedures both carry a meaningful risk of harm and can be safely deferred.\"\n\nChase has written about being openly lesbian since her 20s. Chase married her partner of five years, Robin Mathias, in San Francisco in 2004. They live on a hobby farm in Sonoma and remarried in 2008 following the \"In re Marriage Cases\".\n\n\n"}

The Yugoslav government followed the pattern of the Soviet Union, with two types of farms, the state farms and collective farms. The peasants' holdings were operated under government supervision, the state farms owned by the governments were operated by hired labour. Of the European communist states, Yugoslavia ranked second, behind Bulgaria, in proportion of peasant households in collectives.

Their creation does not increase the overall number of seats in the Assembly, which remains stable at 577, since it is compensated for by a redrawing of boundaries which reduces the number of seats in France itself to 566. These measures were implemented for the June 2012 legislative election. (There are already Senators representing overseas citizens, since 1982, but, like all French Senators, they are elected indirectly, by the Assembly of French Citizens Abroad.)\n\nThe creation of these constituencies created some controversy, when \"Le Monde\" estimated that they would be far more favourable to the main centre-right party, the Union for a Popular Movement (UMP), then in power, than to the main centre-left party, the Socialist Party (PS). The newspaper pointed out that, in nine of these constituencies, a majority of voters appeared to favour the right, based on the figures from the 2007 French presidential election. The constituency of Central and Eastern Europe and that of North-West Africa were the only ones to appear left-leaning. While \"Le Monde\" provided the figures without comment, left-wing politicians such as Socialist MP Jean-Jacques Urvoas suggested that the government was attempting to provide itself with extra seats, and Communist MP Jean-Paul Lecoq suggested overseas citizens should continue to vote solely in French constituencies.\n\nContrary to expectations, however, the Socialist Party candidates won seven of the eleven constituencies in the 2012 election, with their parliamentary allies in Europe Ecology – The Greens (EELV) winning one, and the UMP winning only three. Two of the winning Socialist candidates were later disqualified by the Constitutional Council due to campaign finance irregularities. They were replaced in by-elections by a candidate from the UMP and a candidate from the center-right Union of Democrats and Independents (UDI), leaving the overseas constituencies with five MPs from the Socialist Party, four from UMP (which in 2015 changed its name to The Republicans), one from EELV, and one from UDI.\n\nIn the 2017 election, Emmanuel Macron's party La République En Marche! (REM) won a majority of seats in the National Assembly nationwide and also was the most successful party in the overseas constituencies, winning 8 of the 11 seats. Another constituency went to a candidate from MoDem, which is allied with REM in the legislature. One UDI candidate retained his seat, and one seat was won by an independent candidate.\n\nIn all, the Americas are divided into two constituencies, North and South (1 & 2); Europe into six (3 to 8), with the eighth constituency also incorporating Israel; and Africa into two (9 & 10), with the tenth constituency also incorporating the Arabian peninsula as well as Iraq, Syria and Lebanon. The eleventh constituency, the largest, includes every other country in Asia, as well as the entirety of Oceania, along with Belarus, Moldova and Ukraine. Overseas departments and territories of France are not included, as they are \"de jure\" part of France, and already have . In addition, North Korea, which is not diplomatically recognised by France, is not part of any constituency. The same is true of Bhutan. Kosovo, which is recognised by France, is part of the seventh constituency. Taiwan is incorporated into the eleventh constituency as part of China, as France recognises the One China policy. Western Sahara is not part of any constituency - being neither recognised as part of Morocco, nor included in the ninth constituency in its own right. The status of the Palestinian territories is not explicitly defined, but French residents there were able to vote, as part of the same constituency as Israel. Other self-proclaimed and \"de facto\" but non-recognised independent countries, such as Somaliland or Abkhazia, are incorporated as part of the country which claims sovereignty over them.\n\nThe 2012 legislative election resulted in the election of the very first National Assembly members representing French residents overseas.\n\nVoting occurred over a week, from 23 to 29 May or on 2 or 3 June for the first round, well in advance of voting in metropolitan France (10 June) or certain French overseas territories and departments (9 June). Second round voting occurred from 6 to 12 June or on 16 or 17 June (as opposed to 17 June alone in metropolitan France). Unlike their compatriots in France itself, expatriates could vote by postal ballot or over the Internet, though they could of course vote in person in their local consulate. The date depends on voters' location and the method by which they cast their ballot. If an expatriate voted via the Internet, he or she had a week to do so from 23 to 26 May. A postal ballot could be cast, if received by 31 May in the Americas or by 1 June in the rest of the world. Those who preferred to vote in person in their local consulate had to do so on 2 June in the Americas or 3 June in the rest of the world.\n\nIn April 2011, the ruling Union for a Popular Movement chose several prominent members to stand as candidates overseas. Thus, Frédéric Lefebvre, Secretary of State for Commerce, was chosen as UMP candidate for the First constituency; Éric Besson, Minister of Industry, for the Fifth; and Thierry Mariani, Secretary of State for Transport, for the Eleventh.\n\nBy contrast, the Socialist Party preferred to select long-term residents of their respective constituencies, who are active in their local community but generally unknown in national French politics.\n\nNumerous other parties presented candidates, in particular the MoDem and the Left Front. Many independent candidates were also present in all consistencies.\n\nIn the first round, the Socialist Party finished first in six constituencies, while a Socialist-endorsed Green candidate finished first in the second constituency (Central America, Caribbean and South America). The Union for a Popular Movement finished first in the other three (the fifth, tenth and eleventh). The second round, in every constituency except the second, was a run-off between the Socialist Party and the UMP. The second round confirmed this trend, with the left taking eight seats, and the UMP only three. This was a significant surprise; early indications had been that most of the seats would go to the right. Indeed, the UMP government had been accused of having created these constituencies so as to establish right-wing safe seats. The left's victory in North America was described as \"incredible\", and explained, by commentators in \"Libération\", as being due to Socialist candidate Corinne Narassiguin's strong and active campaign, and local voters' rejection of UMP candidate Frédéric Lefebvre, perceived as knowing little about North America and as barely speaking English.\n\nTurnout was particularly low in every constituency (from 13 to 28%). A number of expatriates, living far from any polling station, said they had been unable to vote online, because they had not received the necessary login codes, or because of errors when they attempted to log in and cast their vote. Others said they had abstained deliberately, considering that they should not be voting in an election when the results would primarily affect residents of France. Others considered that the candidates were necessarily ill-suited to represent the interests of expatriates scattered over often vast and diverse territories. Based on projections from the 2007 presidential election results, the carving of constituencies should have resulted in a 9-to-2 division of the seats between the UMP and the Socialists, however French expatriates ended up electing seven Socialists, one Green (Europe Écologie - Les Verts) and three UMP deputies. The results were likely impacted by low turnout and support for Francois Hollande following his presidential election.\n\nIn February 2013, the elections of Socialist MPs Corinne Narassiguin and Daphna Poznanski-Benhamou were annulled by the Constitutional Council, due to irregularities in the funding of their electoral campaigns. They were barred from standing for public office for a period of one year. Four defeated right-wing candidates in their two constituencies were also barred from standing for public office for a year, for the same reason.\n\nElected MPs:\n\n\n"}

Moreover, in \"The Rebel Sell: Why the Culture Can't be Jammed\" (2004), Joseph Heath and Andrew Potter describe \"distinction\" as a social competition in which the styles of social fashion are in continual development, and that the men and women who do not follow the development of social trends soon become stale, and irrelevant to their social-class stratum.\n\n"}
{"id": "3225404", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=3225404", "title": "English Reformation Parliament", "text": "English Reformation Parliament\n\nThe English Reformation Parliament, which sat from 3 November 1529 to 14 April 1536, was the English Parliament that passed the major pieces of legislation leading to the Break with Rome and establishment of the Church of England. In Scotland, their 1560 Parliament had a similar role. Sitting in the reign of King Henry VIII of England, the Parliament was the first to deal with major religious legislation, much of it orchestrated by Thomas Cromwell.\n\nAfter the failure of Cardinal Wolsey to win the Court of Blackfriars, Henry VIII was frustrated. He was left without a male heir, and his wife, Catherine of Aragon, was considered to be past child-bearing age. In 1529, Henry opened what would later become known as the English Reformation Parliament. It opened in the month of October and ran until December 1529 without forming a coherent plan on what to do. Because of this, Henry used it to discredit Wolsey. Soon after this Henry turned his attentions to the church itself.\n\nThe major pieces of legislation from the Reformation Parliament included: \n\nAn Act passed to prevent the Clergy being subject to separate canonical courts. Instead they were now to be tried in the same way as everybody else in England was and not be looked upon favourably by the courts.\n\nThe Parliament accepted the reinstatement of the charge named Praemunire where individuals could be convicted of a crime for appealing to any power outside of the realm for resolution of a situation within England. In particular, the law was aimed at those recognising the Pope's authority. The law gave leave that charges could be dropped if fines of £118,000 were paid.\n\nThe session of 1532 saw plan and purpose that had not been evident in earlier sessions.\n\nThe first Act of Annates (the Act in Conditional Restraint of Annates) was passed allowing only 5% of the money normally remitted to Rome. Annates were monies (church taxes effectively) that were collected in England and sent to Rome. They were levied on any diocese by Rome as payment in return for the nomination and papal authorization for the consecration of a bishop. One third of the first year's revenues from the particular diocese went to Rome. The king passed legislation threatening to deprive the Pope of these revenues. During this year even more intensive work was done to try to get Pope Clement to agree to the divorce Henry required. The Parliament threatened that if Henry did not get his annulment/divorce within a year, then all payments to Rome would be stopped. The anti-clerical Act titled Supplication Against the Ordinaries was also passed.\n\nThe Annates threat was carried out but not yet legalised by Parliament. Cromwell's Act in Restraint of Appeals was passed, preparing the way for further Praemunire charges against leading Catholic clergy and nobles who disagreed with the King's wish to divorce.\n\nPayment of Peter's Pence (a tax collected annually from householders) to the See of Rome was abolished. The act also eradicated Pluralism in the clergy (the right to hold more than one parish) and forbade English clergy from attending religious assemblies abroad.\n\nDeclared Henry VIII and Catherine of Aragon's marriage invalid and Mary as the illegitimate product of this marriage. The Act of Succession secured the children of Henry and Anne Boleyn to which the whole nation had to swear an oath by. To reject the oath was made treasonous.\n\nThe Second Act of Annates was passed, called the Act in Absolute Restraint of Annates. The annates were, along with the supremacy over the church in England, reserved to the crown, and the English crown now took all revenue charged for the appointment of bishops. The Act of First Fruits and Tenths transferred the taxes on ecclesiastical income from the Pope to the Crown. The Treasons Act 1534 made it high treason punishable by death to deny Royal Supremacy. The first Act of Supremacy (among other things) began the process by which the dissolution of monasteries was to be undertaken. It quickly followed the receipt of a survey called \"Valor Ecclesiasticus\", but applied only to religious houses with an income of less than two hundred pounds a year.\n\n"}

It was an organ of Historical revisionism (negationism) for Norwegians who were found to be Nazi collaborators during the Second World War.\n\n\"Folk og Land\" had its predecessor in \"Skolenytt\", stenciled and published by the Kristiansund-based former teacher Nils Vikdal from 1947. His agenda was to spread news to former members of Lærersambandet, a trade union for teachers set up by the Quisling regime during the occupation of Norway by Nazi Germany (1940–1945). It was stenciled until the summer of 1948, when printing began. The name was also changed to \"8. Mai\", named after the day the occupation ended.\n\n\"Folk og Land\" was formally started on 6 December 1952, edited by Finn Brun Knudsen. It had an informal affiliation to the organization Forbundet for Sosial Oppreisning (FSO, later renamed Institutt for Norsk Okkupasjonshistorie), made up by former collaborators who were critical to the legal purge in Norway after World War II and the victors' version of history. FSO chairman Anders Hafskjold was among the early shareholders in \"Folk og Land\". From 1958 the newspaper was officially a co-operative with Forbundet for Sosial Oppreisning as owners. At the same time, the last editor of the now-forbidden Nasjonal Samling newspaper \"Fritt Folk\", Odd Erling Melsom, was hired as editor-in-chief, a position he held until 1978. He succeeded Johannes Kringlebotn. Post-1978 editors include Alexander Lange and Kjell Blich Schreiner.\n\nThe newspaper makers claimed that their circulation was six of seven thousand in the 1960s; this is a dubious figure. Some hundred copies were also distributed for free to politicians and the press all over Norway. The goals of the newspaper makers were to gain acceptance for their version of history, as well as to gain legal reparations from the Parliament of Norway (in which they have failed). They meant that aggressors other than Germany caused the Second World War, that the Allies caused most harm during the war, and that once Germany had occupied Norway, collaborators (including Quisling) did the right thing in that they represented a Norwegian rule over the country instead of letting Germans take over.\n\nIn its last years of existence, \"Folk og Land\" was published monthly. The last issue came on 27 April 2003.\n\nHans Fredrik Dahl has stated that \"in several cases, the historical revisionism of the magazine has proven worthwhile\". In Egil Ulateig's 1996 book \"Med rett til å drepe\", where Hans Fredrik Dahl was a historical consultant, the newspaper was used extensively as a source text. Specifically, Ulateig used a series of articles printed under the title \"Okkupasjonstidens likvidasjoner\", between 7 November 1970 and 25 November 1972. Ulateig's book contained 136 people which allegedly had been liquidated by the Norwegian resistance movement, many cases taken verbatim from \"Folk og Land\". In a thorough critique, Arnfinn Moland found that 63 of them were correct, most of the rest were nonsense taken from \"Folk og Land\". The newspaper series, said Moland, looked like it was written by a \"more or less imbalanced\" person.\n\n"}

Mauritania is estimated to have between 140,000 and 600,000 slaves. The group has a \"network of nine thousand activists\" according to journalist Alexis Okeowo.\n\nThe group was founded in 2008 and is described by Abeid as \"an organization of popular struggle\". The group has been involved in sit-ins in front of the justice ministry, hunger strikes, and marches through cities and towns around Mauritania. The group fights against the religious justification\nof slavery.\n\nAccording to Abeid, the group moved on to more direct action in its protests because, “whenever we brought a slavery case to the police, they would release the slave owner.” In 2010 and 2011, the group won a \"seminal victory\" when it gathered in front of the house of a slave owner and demanded the police arrest him. Both Abeid and the slave owner were arrested—Abeid jailed for three months, the slave owner was released after nine days—but it was the first time that police in Mauritania had imprisoned a slave owner. Other protests and arrests of owners followed (the organization has helped to put about twenty owners in jail as of September 2014). Though the jailings were often only for brief terms, the release of \"thousands of slaves\" (called \"Biram Frees\") by fearful owners ensued.\n\nThe Initiative feels under pressure from the Mauritanian government which refuses to allow it to register as a nongovernmental organization, and threatened or persuaded supporter to end their support. Lacking NGO status makes it impossible to solicit funding through grants. IRA has relied on gifts from patrons, mainly government employees. The government has persuaded other activists to leave the movement, threatening them or winning them over with lucrative state jobs.\n\nIRA-Mauritania received the Human Rights Tulip award in December 2015.\n\n"}

Although it was a registered UK political party, it was described as an umbrella organisation giving financial and marketing backing to independent candidates, who were free to set their own political agenda outside of the traditional model of standing as the candidate of a particular party. Jury Team employed a novel selection process for its independent candidates, allowing any member of the public to apply to be promoted for backing, and leaving final candidate selection to the public, by text message voting. After contesting the European Parliament elections in June 2009, the Jury Team's first Independent United Kingdom parliamentary candidate was John Smeaton, who stood in the 2009 Glasgow North East by-election.\n\nThe Jury Team campaign for more independent politicians was launched on 8 March 2009 by Sir Paul Judge, a businessman and former director-general of the Conservative Party. Jury Team was registered with the UK's Electoral Commission's Register of Political Parties on 13 March 2009, eligible to field candidates in England, Scotland and Wales. Sir Paul is the registered Jury Team Leader and Treasurer, while Alan Wallace is the Jury Team Nominating Officer.\n\nThe name \"Jury Team\" reflected the idea behind the jury, that \"regular people can make decisions about complex problems with integrity and without any vested interests\".\n\nJury Team was described as an umbrella organisation, with the purpose of giving Independent non-party candidates the platform to compete against the established UK political parties, free of party allegiance and a party whip. The Jury Team aimed to \"break the traditional party leaderships' control over the political process\". A YouGov poll commissioned by Jury Team as part of its launch suggested that 55% of electors would vote for an Independent candidate if they thought they had a realistic chance of being elected.\n\nJury Team had no manifesto or specific policies; any member of the public who was considered to be \"committed to the principles of good governance, including selflessness, integrity, openness and honesty\" could be publicised by the organisation as a potential Jury Team candidate, and candidates were selected by a system of public voting by text message. The Jury Team candidates that stood in the 2009 European elections represented both sides of the political spectrum as well as those representing several single issue platforms.\n\nAs well as \"Jury Team\", \"Jury Team Party\" and \"Jury Team Independents\", the organisation also registered the following as official Party Descriptions: \"Democracy 2.0\", \"Democracy, Accountability, Transparency\", \"Politics for the People\", \"Politics Isn't Working\", \"Politics with Principles\" and \"Politics without Parties\".\n\nWhile Jury Team had no party policies, they did declare 12 basic principles on issues of governance and representation, covering areas such as term limits and pay transparency for elected representatives, changes to the operation of select committees and government departments, independence of statistical reporting and complaints functions, and changes to the rules regarding referendums and calling of general elections. They opposed the alternative vote and said that the AV referendum was a \"political stitch-up\".\n\nAccording to its founder and leader Sir Paul Judge, Jury Team Independent candidates \"legally committed themselves to our three guiding principles of democracy, accountability and transparency and to abiding by the seven Nolan Principles of Public Life\", and \"had all \"pledged to vote on conscience for the good of their constituents and the country and will not be required to obey a party whip\".\n\nJury Team Independent candidates for the 2009 European Parliament elections could stand for selection in every British European Parliament constituency region except Northern Ireland. Candidates individual political positions were promoted through the Jury Team website between 16 March to 24 April 2009, during which time the public could vote for their preferred candidates. The successful candidates in each region were then ranked by the number of text votes cast, in order to produce a 'party list' for each region according to their allocated number of seats. (European Parliament seats from in England, Scotland and Wales are allocated using a system of proportional representation using the d'Hondt formula.)\n\nOn 25 September 2009 it was announced that John Smeaton, an airport worker who came to national attention for intervening in the 2007 Glasgow International Airport attack, \nwould be the first candidate selected by Jury Team to stand for a seat in the Westminster Parliament, and would contest the 2009 Glasgow North East by-election for the vacant seat formerly held by the Speaker of the House Michael Martin.\n\nJury Team backed 59 Independent candidates in the 2009 European Parliament elections. While no Jury Team candidate gained a seat in the European Parliament, the candidates collectively registered 0.5% of the total votes cast in Great Britain, ranking Jury Team candidates as a whole 13th among other parties in Great Britain.\n\nJohn Smeaton stood as the Jury Team backed Independent candidate in the 2009 Glasgow North East by-election, he came eighth out of 13 candidates with 258 votes.\n\nJury Team fielded Independent candidates in the 2010 General Election, on 6 May 2010. The group hoped to increase on the number of 5 Independent MPs elected in 2005 out of a total of 646 currently sitting in the House of Commons. No Jury Team candidates were elected MPs.\n\nThe Jury Team campaign was funded by Sir Paul Judge from his estimated £30m personal wealth, together with three other financial backers. The organisation's financial rules precluded individual donations of more than £50,000, in line with the 2006 Sir Hayden Phillips inquiry.\n\nJury Team's candidate public vote by text message selection method was likened to the reality TV shows \"The X-Factor\" and \"American Idol\". \"TIME\" magazine called the movement similar to the reality show \"American Idol\" Jury Team's lack of manifesto attracted the moniker the \"anti-party party\". Anthony King stated of Jury Team that \"The idea that a non-party party could get very far is farfetched.\"\n\n\n"}

In the 1920s the policy of korenization (nativization) promoted representatives of the titular nation, and their national minorities, into the lower administrative-levels of the local government, bureaucracy, and nomenklatura of their Soviet republics. In Russian, the term derives from (, \"native population\", or literally \"root population\").\n\nPolitically and culturally, the nativization policy aimed to eliminate Russian domination and culture in the said soviet republics. The de-Russification was forced even on ethnic Russians and their children. For example, all children in Ukraine were forced to learn the Ukrainian language. The policies of korenization facilitated the Communist Party's establishment of the local languages in government and education, in publishing, in culture, and in public life. In that manner, the cadre of the local Communist Party were promoted to every level of government, and ethnic Russians working in said governments were required to learn the local language and culture of the given soviet republic.\n\nThe nationalities policy was formulated by the Bolshevik party in 1913, four years before they came to power in Russia. Vladimir Lenin sent a young Joseph Stalin (himself a Georgian and therefore an ethnic minority member) to Vienna, which was a very ethnically diverse city due to its status as capital of the Austro-Hungarian empire. Stalin reported back to Moscow with his ideas for the policy. It was summarized in Stalin's pamphlet (his first scholarly publication), \"Marxism and the National Question\" (1913). Ironically Stalin would also be the major proponent of its eventual dismemberment and the reemergence of Russification.\n\nFaced with the massive non-Russian opposition to his regime, Lenin in late 1919 convinced his associates their government had to stop the cultural administrative and linguistic policies it was following in the non-Russian republics. As adopted in 1923 korenizatziya involved teaching and administration in the language of the republic; and promoting non-Russians to positions of power in Republic administrations and the party, including for a time the creation of a special group of soviets called \"natssoviety\" (nationality councils) in their own \"natsraiony\" (nationality regions) based on concentrations of minorities within what were minority republics. For example, in Ukraine in the late 1920s there were even natssoviety for Russians and Estonians.\n\nThis policy was meant to partially reverse decades of Russification, or promotion of Russian identity culture and language in non-Russian territories that had taken place during the imperial period. It won over many previously anti-bolshevik non-Russians throughout the country. It also provoked hostility among some Russians and Russified non-Russians in non-Russian republics.\n\nIn 1920s, the society was still not \"Socialist\". There was animosity towards the Russians and towards other nationalities on the part of the Russians, but there were also conflicts and rivalries among other nationalities.\n\nIn 1923 at the 12th Party Congress, Stalin identified two threats to the success of the party's \"nationalities policy\": Great Power Chauvinism (Russian chauvinism) and local nationalism. However, he described the former as the greater danger:\n\n[The] Great-Russian chauvinist spirit, which is becoming stronger and stronger owing to the N.E.P., . . . [finds] expression in an arrogantly disdainful and heartlessly bureaucratic attitude on the part of Russian Soviet officials towards the needs and requirements of the national republics. The multi-national Soviet state can become really durable, and the co-operation of the peoples within it really fraternal, only if these survivals are vigorously and irrevocably eradicated from the practice of our state institutions. Hence, the first immediate task of our Party is vigorously to combat the survivals of Great-Russian chauvinism.\nThe main danger, Great-Russian chauvinism, should be kept in check by the Russians themselves, for the sake of the larger goal of building socialism. Within the (minority) nationality areas new institutions should be organized giving the state a national (minority) character everywhere, built on the use of the nationality languages in government and education, and on the recruitment and promotion of leaders from the ranks of minority groups. On the central level the nationalities should be represented in the Soviet of Nationalities.\n\nThe main idea of the \"Korenizatsiya\" was to grow communist cadres for every nationality. By the mid-1930s the percentage of locals in both the party and state service grew considerably.\n\nThe initial period of korenizatsiya went together with the development of national-territorial administrative units and national cultures. The latter was reflected above all in the areas of language construction and education. For several of the small nationalities in Russia that had no literary language, a \"Committee of the North\" helped to create alphabets so that the national languages could be taught in schools and literacy could be brought to the people in their native languages — and the minorities would thereby be brought from backwardness to the modern world. And in the very large Ukrainian Republic, the program of Ukrainianization led to a profound shift of the language of instruction in schools to Ukrainian.\n\nIn 1930, Stalin proclaimed at the 16th Party Congress that building socialism was a period of blossoming of national cultures. The final goal would be to merge into one international culture with a common language. Meanwhile, the first Five-Year Plan in 1928–1931 was a period of radicalism, utopianism and violence in an atmosphere of \"cultural revolution\" . Russian cultural heritage was under attack, churches were closed, old specialists were dismissed, and science and art were proletarianized.\n\nThe Bolsheviks' tactics in their struggle to neutralise nationalist aspirations led to political results by the beginning of the 1930s. The old structure of the Russian Empire had been destroyed and a hierarchical federal state structure, based on the national principle, was created. The structure was nationality-based states in which nationality cultures were blossoming, and nationality languages were spoken and used at schools and in local administration. The transition was real, not merely a centralized Russian empire camouflaged.\n\nThe 17th Party congress in 1934, proclaimed that the building of the material basis for a socialist society had succeeded. The Soviet Union first became an officially socialist society in 1936 when the new constitution was adopted. The new constitution stated that the many socialist nations had transformed on a voluntary basis into a harmonious union. According to the new constitution there were 11 socialist republics, 22 autonomous republics, nine autonomous regions and nine national territories. At the same time, administration was now greatly centralised. All the Republics were now harnessed to serve one common socialist state.\n\nBetween 1933 and 1938 korenizatsiya was not actually repealed. Its provisions merely stopped being enforced. There also began purges of the leaderships of the national republics and territories. The charge against non-Russians was that they had instigated national strife and oppressed the Russians or other minorities in the republics. In 1937 it was proclaimed that local elites had become hired agents and their goal had become dismemberment of the Soviet Union and the restoration of capitalism. Now it was time to see that the Russians got fair treatment. National leaderships of the republics and autonomies were liquidated en masse.\n\nBy the mid-1930s, with purges in some of the national areas, the policy of korenizatsiya took a new turn, and by the end of the 1930s the policy of promoting local languages began to be balanced by greater , though perhaps not overt Russification or attempts to assimilate the minorities.\n\nMoreover, the country's leader seemed set on greatly reducing the number of officially recognized nationalities by contracting the official list of nationalities in the 1939 census, compared with the 1926 census. The development of so-called \"national schools\" (национальные школы) in which the languages of minority nationalities were the main media of instruction continued, spreading literacy and universal education in many national minority languages, while teaching Russian as a required subject of study. The term korenizatsiya went out of use in the latter half of the 1930s, replaced by more bureaucratic expressions, such as \"selection and placement of national cadres\" (подбор и расстановка национальных кадров).\n\nFrom 1937 the central press started to praise Russian language and Russian culture. Mass campaigns were organized to denounce the \"enemies of the people\". \"Bourgeois nationalists\" were new enemies of the Russian people which had suppressed the Russian language. The policy of indigenization was abandoned. In the following years the Russian language became a compulsory subject in all Soviet schools.\n\nThe pre-revolution Russian nationalism was also rehabilitated. Many of the heroes of Russian history were glorified. The Russian people became the \"elder brother\" of the \"Socialist family of nations\". A new kind of patriotism, Soviet patriotism, was declared to mean a willingness to fight for the Socialist fatherland.\n\nIn 1938 Russian became a mandatory subject of study in all non-Russian schools. In general the cultural and linguistic russification reflected the overall centralization imposed by Stalin. The Cyrillic script was instituted for a number of Soviet languages, including the languages of Central Asia that in the late 1920s had been given Latin alphabets to replace Arabic ones.\n\n\n"}

In medieval Western Europe, there were two competing systems of landed property, on one hand manoralism, inherited from the Roman villa system, where a large estate is owned by the Lord of the Manor and \nleased to tenants, and on the other hand the family farm or \"Hof\" owned by and heritable within a commoner family (c.f. yeoman), inherited from Germanic law.\n\nA gentleman farmer is the largely historic term for a country gentleman who has a farm as part of his estate and farms mainly for pleasure rather than for profit. His acreage may vary from under ten to hundreds of acres. The gentleman farmer employed labourers and farm managers. However, according to the 1839 \"Encyclopedia of Agriculture\", he \"did not associate with these minor working brethren\". The chief source of income for the gentleman farmer was derived not from any income that his landed property may generate; he had either access to his own private income, he worked as a professional and/or he owned a large business elsewhere. Or all three. \n\nModern landed property often consists of housing or industrial land, generating income in the form of rents or fees for services provided by the facilities on the land, such as port facilities. Owners often commission an estate map to help manage their estate as well as serving as a status symbol.\n\nLanded property was a key element of feudalism, and freed the owner for other tasks, such as government administration, military service, the practice of Law, or religious practices.\n\nIn later times, the dominant role of landed estates as a basis of public service faded. Development of manufacturing and commerce created capitalist means of obtaining income, but ordinarily demanding the attention of the owner; at roughly the same time, governments began imposing taxes to fund government bureaus and the military so that people of talent could perform government services for salaries without need for the proceeds of ownership of farmland. Parts of the United States of America, typically New England, Pennsylvania, and most of the states west of the original colonies never had a landed aristocracy, so their armed forces and government agencies could never be organized on the basis of a landed aristocracy.\n"}

{"id": "1138182", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1138182", "title": "Limited liability", "text": "Limited liability\n\nLimited liability is where a person's financial liability is limited to a fixed sum, most commonly the value of a person's investment in a company or partnership. If a company with limited liability is sued, then the claimants are suing the company, not its owners or investors. A shareholder in a limited company is not personally liable for any of the debts of the company, other than for the amount already invested in the company and for any unpaid amount on the shares in the company, if any. The same is true for the members of a limited liability partnership and the limited partners in a limited partnership. By contrast, sole proprietors and partners in general partnerships are each liable for all the debts of the business (unlimited liability).\n\nIf shares are issued \"part-paid\", then the shareholders are liable, when a claim is made against the capital of the company, to pay to the company the balance of the face or par value of the shares.\n\nAlthough a shareholder's liability for the company's actions is limited, the shareholders may still be liable for their own acts. For example, the directors of small companies (who are frequently also shareholders) are often required to give personal guarantees of the company's debts to those lending to the company. They will then be liable for those debts in the event that the company cannot pay, although the other shareholders will not be so liable. This is known as co-signing.\n\nBy the 15th century, English law had awarded limited liability to monastic communities and trade guilds with commonly held property. In the 17th century, joint stock charters were awarded by the crown to monopolies such as the East India Company. The world's first modern limited liability law was enacted by the state of New York in 1811. In England it became more straightforward to incorporate a joint stock company following the Joint Stock Companies Act 1844, although investors in such companies carried unlimited liability until the Limited Liability Act 1855.\n\nThere was a degree of public and legislative distaste for a limitation of liability, with fears that it would cause a drop in standards of probity. The 1855 Act allowed limited liability to companies of more than 25 members (shareholders). Insurance companies were excluded from the act, though it was standard practice for insurance contracts to exclude action against individual members. Limited liability for insurance companies was allowed by the Companies Act 1862. The minimum number of members necessary for registration as a limited company was reduced to seven by the Companies Act 1856. Limited companies in England and Wales now require only one member.\n\nSimilar statutory regimes were in place in France and in the majority of the U.S. states by 1860. By the final quarter of the nineteenth century, most European countries had adopted the principle of limited liability. The development of limited liability facilitated the move to large-scale industrial enterprise, by removing the threat that an individual's total wealth would be confiscated if invested in an unsuccessful company. Large sums of personal financial capital became available, and the transferability of shares permitted a degree of business continuity not possible in other forms of enterprise.\n\nIn the UK there was initially a widespread belief that a corporation needed to demonstrate its creditworthiness by having its shares only partly paid, as where shares are partly paid, the investor would be liable for the remainder of the nominal value in the event that the company could not pay its debts. Shares with nominal values of up to £1,000 were therefore subscribed to with only a small payment, leaving even a limited liability investor with a potentially crushing liability and restricting investment to the very wealthy. During the Overend Gurney crisis (1866–1867) and the Long Depression (1873–1896) many companies fell into insolvency and the unpaid portion of the shares fell due. Further, the extent to which small and medium investors were excluded from the market was admitted and, from the 1880s onwards, shares were more commonly fully paid.\n\nAlthough it was admitted that those who were mere investors ought not to be liable for debts arising from the management of a corporation, throughout the late nineteenth century there were still many arguments for unlimited liability for managers and directors on the model of the French \"société en commandite\". Such liability for directors of English companies was abolished in 2006. Further, it became increasingly common from the end of the nineteenth century for shareholders to be directors, protecting themselves from liability.\n\nIn 1989, the European Union enacted its Twelfth Council Company Law Directive, requiring that member states make available legal structures for individuals to trade with limited liability. This was implemented in England and Wales by Statutory Instrument SI 1992/1699 which allowed single-member limited-liability companies.\n\nIn the United States, decentralized corporate law and competition between states for corporate charters and investment led to widespread adoption of freely available limited liability beginning in the 1800s and culminating in the early 1900s. However, limited liability has been curtailed in specific contexts such as environmental liabilities or (in some states) employees unpaid back-wages.\n\nLimited liability is related to the concept of separate legal personality bestowed on the corporate form, which is promoted as encouraging entrepreneurship by various economists, enabling large sums to be pooled towards an economically beneficial purpose.\n\nAn early critic of limited liability, Edward William Cox, a lifelong member of the Conservative Party, wrote in 1855:\n\n[T]hat he who acts through an agent should be responsible for his agent's acts, and that he who shares the profits of an enterprise ought also to be subject to its losses; that there is a moral obligation, which it is the duty of the laws of a civilised nation to enforce, to pay debts, perform contracts and make reparation for wrongs. Limited liability is founded on the opposite principle and permits a man to avail himself of acts if advantageous to him, and not to be responsible for them if they should be disadvantageous; to speculate for profits without being liable for losses; to make contracts, incur debts, and commit wrongs, the law depriving the creditor, the contractor, and the injured of a remedy against the property or person of the wrongdoer, beyond the limit, however small, at which it may please him to determine his own liability \n\nSome critics argue that limited liability favors creditors who are in the position to negotiate secured terms, whereas small creditors' debts are left unsecured. Others argue that while some limited liability is beneficial, the privilege ought not to extend to liability in tort for environmental disasters or personal injury.\n\nSome argue that limited liability provides investors with insurance-like benefits, without the cost of insurance premiums or safety regulations that usually accompany insurance, and that it therefore be advisable to charge firms for limited liability a rate that reflects risks of limited liability imposing costs on the government or the public. Critics also argue that this would accelerate the spread of information about poorly understood risk. \n\nAnarcho-capitalist Murray N. Rothbard, in his \"Power and Market\" (1970), criticized the need of limited liability laws, observing that similar arrangements emerge upon mutual and voluntary agreement in a free market:\n\nFinally, the question may be raised: Are corporations themselves mere grants of monopoly privilege? Some advocates of the free market were persuaded to accept this view by Walter Lippmann's \"The Good Society\". It should be clear from previous discussion, however, that corporations are not at all monopolistic privileges; they are free associations of individuals pooling their capital. On the purely free market, such individuals would simply announce to their creditors that their liability is limited to the capital specifically invested in the corporation, and that beyond this their personal funds are not liable for debts, as they would be under a partnership arrangement. It then rests with the sellers and lenders to this corporation to decide whether or not they will transact business with it. If they do, then they proceed at their own risk. Thus, the government does not grant corporations a privilege of limited liability; anything announced and freely contracted for in advance is a right of a free individual, not a special privilege. It is not necessary that governments grant charters to corporations.\n\n\n"}

A former army officer, Humala lost the 2006 presidential election and eventually won the 2011 presidential election in a run-off vote. He was elected as President of Peru in the second round, defeating Keiko Fujimori.\n\nThe son of Isaac Humala, a labour lawyer, Humala entered the Peruvian Army in 1981. In the military he achieved the rank of Lieutenant Colonel; in 1991 he fought in the internal conflict against the Shining Path and three years later he participated in the Cenepa War against Ecuador. In October 2000, Humala attempted an unsuccessful coup d'etat by soldiers in the southern city of Tacna against President Alberto Fujimori; he was pardoned by the Peruvian Congress after the downfall of the Fujimori regime.\n\nIn 2005 he founded the Peruvian Nationalist Party and registered to run in the 2006 presidential election. The nomination was made under the Union for Peru ticket as the Nationalist party did not achieve its electoral inscription on time. He passed the first round of the elections, held on April 9, 2006, with 30.62% of the valid votes. A runoff was held on June 4 between Humala and Alan García of the Peruvian Aprista Party. Humala lost this round with 47.47% of the valid votes versus 52.62% for García. After his defeat, Humala remained an important figure within Peruvian politics.\n\nIn February 2016, amidst the Peruvian Presidential Race, a report from the Brazilian Federal Police implicated Humala as recipient of bribes from Odebrecht, a Brazilian construction company, in exchange of assigned public works. President Humala rejected the implication and has avoided speaking to the media on the matter.\n\nHumala was arrested by Peruvian authorities in July 2017 and awaits a corruption trial.\n\nOllanta Humala was born in Lima, Peru on June 27, 1962. He is the son of Isaac Humala, an ethnic Quechua indigenous lawyer, member of the Communist Party of Peru – Red Fatherland, and ideological leader of the Ethnocacerista movement. Ollanta's mother is Elena Tasso, from an old Italian family established in Peru at the end of the 19th century. He is the brother of Antauro Humala, now serving a 25-year prison sentence for kidnapping 17 Police officers for 3 days and killing 4 of them, and professor Ulises Humala. Humala was born in Peru and attended the French-Peruvian school \"Franco-Peruano,\" and later the \"Colegio Cooperativo The Great Union,\" established by part of the Peruvian-Japanese community in Lima. He began his military career in 1982 when he entered the Chorrillos Military School.\n\nIn his military career, Humala was also involved in the two major Peruvian conflicts of the past 20 years, the battle against the insurgent organization Shining Path and the 1995 Cenepa War with Ecuador. In 1992 Humala served in Tingo María fighting the remnants of the Shining Path and in 1995 he served in the Cenepa War on the border with Ecuador.\n\n\"See also (Spanish)\"\n\nIn October 2000, Humala led an uprising in Toquepala against Alberto Fujimori on his last days as President due to multiple corruption scandals. The main reason given for the rebellion was the capture of Vladimiro Montesinos, former intelligence chief who had fled Peru for asylum in Panama after being caught on video trying to bribe an opposition congressman. The return of Montesinos led to fears that he still had much power in Fujimori's government, so Humala and about 40 other Peruvian soldiers revolted against their senior army commander. Montesinos claims that the uprising facilitated his concurrent escape.\n\nMany of Humala's men deserted him, leaving him only 7 soldiers. During the revolt, Humala called on Peruvian \"patriots\" to join him in the rebellion, and around 300 former soldiers led by his brother Antauro answered his call and were reported to have been in a convoy attempting to join up with Humala. The revolt gained some sympathy from the Peruvian populace with the influential opposition newspaper \"La República\" calling him \"valiant and decisive, unlike most in Peru\". The newspaper also had many letters sent in by readers with accolades to Ollanta and his men.\n\nIn the aftermath, the Army sent hundreds of soldiers to capture the rebels. Even so, Humala and his men managed to hide until President Fujimori was impeached from office a few days later and Valentín Paniagua named interim president. Later Humala was pardoned by Congress and allowed to return to military duty. He was sent as military attaché to Paris, then to Seoul until December 2004, when he was forcibly retired. His forced retirement is suspected to have partly motivated an \"etnocacerista\" rebellion of Andahuaylas led by his brother Antauro Humala in January 2005.\n\nIn 2002 Humala received a master's degree in Political Science from the Pontifical Catholic University of Peru.\n\nIn October 2005 Humala created the Partido Nacionalista Peruano (the Peruvian Nationalist Party) and ran for the presidency in 2006 with the support of Union for Peru (UPP).\n\nAmbassador Javier Pérez de Cuéllar, the former Peruvian Secretary-General of the United Nations and founder of UPP, told the press on December 5, 2005, that he did not support the election of Humala as the party's presidential candidate. He said that after being the UPP presidential candidate in 1995, he had not had any further contact with UPP and therefore did not take part in choosing Humala as the party's presidential candidate for the 2006 elections.\n\nThere were some accusations that he incurred in torture, under the \"nom de guerre\" \"Capitán Carlos\" (\"Captain Carlos\"), while he was the commander of a military base in the jungle region of Madre Mia from 1992 to 1993. His brother Antauro Humala stated in 2006 that Humala had used such a name during their activities. Humala, in an interview with Jorge Ramos, acknowledged that he went under the pseudonym Captain Carlos but stated that other soldiers went under the same name and denied participation in any human rights abuses.\n\nOn March 17, 2006, Humala's campaign came under some controversy as his father, Issac Humala, said \"If I was President, I would grant amnesty to him (Abimael Guzmán) and the other incarcerated members of the Shining Path\". He made similar statements about amnesty for Víctor Polay, the leader of the Túpac Amaru Revolutionary Movement, and other leaders of the MRTA. But Ollanta Humala distanced himself from the more radical members of his family during his campaign. Humala's mother, meanwhile, made a statement on the March 21 calling for homosexuals to be shot.\n\nOllanta Humala's brother, Ulises Humala, ran against him in the election, but was considered an extremely minor candidate and came in 14th place in the election.\n\nOn April 9, 2006, the first round of the Peruvian national election was held. Humala came in first place getting 30.62% of the valid votes, and immediately began preparing to face Alan García, who obtained 24.32%, in a runoff election on June 4.\n\nOn May 20, 2006, the day before the first Presidential debate between Alan García and Ollanta Humala, a tape of the former Peruvian intelligence chief Vladimiro Montesinos was released by Montesinos' lawyer to the press with Montesinos claiming that Humala had started the October 29, 2000 military uprising against the Fujimori government to facilitate his escape from Peru amidst corruption scandals. Montesinos is quoted as saying it was a \"farce, an operation of deception and manipulation\".\n\nHumala immediately responded to the charges by accusing Montesinos of being in collaboration with García's Aprista Party with an intention to undermine his candidacy. Humala is quoted as stating \"I want to declare my indignation at the statements\" and went on to say \"Who benefits from the declarations that stain the honor of Ollanta Humala? Evidently they benefit Alan García\". In another message that Montesinos released to the media through his lawyer he claimed that Humala was a \"political pawn\" of Cuban President Fidel Castro and Venezuelan President Hugo Chávez in an \"asymmetric war\" against the United States. Montesinos went on to state that Humala \"is not a new ideologist or political reformer, but he is an instrument\".\n\nOn May 24, 2006, Humala warned of possible voter fraud in the upcoming second round elections scheduled for June 4. He urged UPP supporters to register as poll watchers \"so votes are not stolen from us during the tabulation at the polling tables.\" Humala went on to cite similar claims of voting fraud in the first round made by right-wing National Unity candidate Lourdes Flores when she told reporters that she felt she had \"lost at the tabulation tables, not at the ballot box\". When asked if he had proof for his claims by CPN Radio Humala stated \"I do not have proof. If I had the proof, I would immediately denounce those responsible to the electoral system\". Alan García responded by stating that Humala was \"crying fraud\" because the polls show him losing the second round.\n\nOn June 4, 2006, the second round of the Peruvian elections were held. With 77% of votes counted and Humala behind García 45.5% to 55.5% respectively, Humala conceded defeat to Alan García and congratulated his opponent's campaign stating at a news conference \"we recognise the results...and we salute the forces that competed against us, those of Mr Garcia\".\n\nOn June 12, 2006 Carlos Torres Caro, Humala's Vice Presidential running mate and elected Congressman for the Union for Peru (UPP), stated that a faction of the UPP would split off from the party after disagreements with Humala to create what Torres calls a \"constructive opposition\". The split came after Humala called on leftist parties to form an alliance with the UPP to become the principal opposition party in Congress. Humala had met with representatives of the Communist Party of Peru – Red Fatherland and the New Left Movement. Humala stated that the opposition would work to \"make sure Garcia complies with his electoral promises\" and again stated that he would not boycott García's inauguration on July 28, 2006.\n\nOn August 16, 2006, prosecutors in Peru filed charges against Humala for alleged human rights abuses including forced disappearance, torture, and murder against Shining Path guerillas during his service in San Martín. Humala responded by denying the charges and stating that he was \"a victim of political persecution\". He said the charges were \"orchestrated by the Alan Garcia administration to neutralize any alternative to his power\".\n\nHumala ran again in the Peruvian general election on April 10, 2011, with Marisol Espinoza his candidate for Vice-President.\n\nOn May 19, at National University of San Marcos and with the support of many Peruvian intellectuals and artists (including Mario Vargas Llosa with reservations), Ollanta Humala signed the \"Compromiso en Defensa de la Democracia\". He campaigned as a center-left leader with the desire to help to create a more equitable framework for distributing the wealth from the country's key natural resources, with the goal of maintaining foreign investment and economic growth in the country while working to improve the condition of an impoverished majority.\n\nGoing into the June 5 runoff election, he was polling in a statistical tie with opponent Keiko Fujimori. He was elected the 94th president of Peru with 51.5% of the vote.\n\nAfter the news of the election of Ollanta as president the Lima Stock Exchange experienced its largest drop ever, though it later stabilised following the announcement of Humala's cabinet appointees, who were judged to be moderate and in line with continuity. However he was also said to have inherited \"a ticking time bomb of disputes stemming in large part from objections by indigenous groups to the damage to water supplies, crops and hunting grounds wrought by mining, logging and oil and gas extraction\" from Alan Garcia. Though he promised the \"poor and disenfranchised\" Peruvians a bigger stake in the rapidly growing national economy, his \"mandate for change...[was seen as] a mandate for moderate change\"; his moderation was reflected in his \"orthodox\" cabinet appointees and his public oath on the Bible to respect investor rights, rule of law and the constitution. He was sworn-in on 28 July 2011.\n\nAs part of his \"social inclusion\" rhetoric during the campaign, his government, led by Prime Minister Salomon Lerner Ghitis, established the Ministry of Development and Social Inclusion in order to coordinate the efficacy of his social programmes.\n\nOllanta Humala expressed sympathy for the regime of Juan Velasco Alvarado, which took power in a bloodless military coup on October 3, 1968, and nationalized various Peruvian industries whilst pursuing a favorable foreign policy with Cuba and the Soviet Union.\nDuring his presidential candidacy in 2006 and his run for the presidency that he ultimately won in 2011, Humala was closely affiliated with other pink tide leaders in Latin America in general and South America in particular. Prior to taking office in 2011 he toured several countries in the Americas where he notably expressed the idea of re-uniting the Peru–Bolivian Confederation. He also visited Brazil, Colombia, the United States, and Venezuela.\n\nDuring the Peruvian presidential election in February 2016, a report by the Brazilian Federal Police implicated Humala in bribery by Odebrecht for public works contracts. President Humala denied the charge and avoided questions from the media on that matter. In July 2017, Humala and his wife were arrested and held in pre-trial detention following investigations into his involvement in the Odebrecht scandal.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "29683711", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=29683711", "title": "Polish anti-religious campaign", "text": "Polish anti-religious campaign\n\nThe Polish Anti-Religious Campaign was initiated by the communist government in Poland which, under the doctrine of Marxism, actively advocated for the disenfranchisement of religion and planned atheisation. To this effect the regime conducted anti-religious propaganda and persecution of clergymen and monasteries. As in most other Communist countries, religion was not outlawed as such (an exception being Albania) and was permitted by the constitution, but the state attempted to achieve an atheistic society.\n\nThe Catholic Church, as the religion of most Poles, was seen as a rival competing for the citizens' allegiance by the government, which attempted to suppress it.\n\nThe Catholic Church in Poland provided strong resistance to the Communist regime and Poland itself had a long history of dissent to foreign rule. The Polish nation rallied to the Church, as had occurred in neighbouring Lithuania, which made it more difficult for the regime to impose its antireligious policies as it had in the USSR, where the populace did not hold mass solidarity with the Russian Orthodox Church. It became the strongest opponent of the regime throughout the rule of Communism in Poland, and provided a more successful resistance than had religious bodies in most other Communist states.\n\nThe Catholic Church unequivocally condemned communist ideology. This led to the antireligious activity in Poland being compelled to take a more cautious and conciliatory line than in other Communist countries, largely failing in their attempt to control or suppress the Polish Church.\nThe predecessor to the Communist government in Poland was the Polish Committee of National Liberation, which first took office in Soviet-occupied Lublin in 1944. It initially gave favourable promises to the Church in Poland, including restoration of property that the Nazis had taken and exempting Church property from agrarian reform.\n\nThe experiences in and after World War II, wherein the large Jewish minority was annihilated by the Nazis, the large German minority was forcibly expelled from the country at the end of the war, along with the loss of the eastern territories which had a significant population of Eastern Orthodox Belarusians and Ukrainians, led to Poland becoming more homogeneously Catholic than it had been.\n\nAfter Soviet troops occupied Poland at the end of World War II, the Soviet-backed government enacted a gradual approach aimed at gaining control of the Catholic Church in Poland.\n\nAfter the war was finished the government permitted Catholic welfare services to resume work, and the government rebuilt damaged or destroyed churches at a substantial public cost. The Catholic Church in Poland during the first few years was treated much better than most other religious bodies in the newly liberated states of Eastern Europe. This more lenient approach came as a result of Communism's lack of popularity among Poles and the difficulty the new regime had in presenting itself as the legitimate government of Poland; attacking the Church at this time, which was well supported by most Poles, was considered too risky to attempt.\n\nGeneral Karol Świerczewski, who had fought in the international brigade in the Spanish Civil War, was given Catholic funeral rites, Polish radio broadcast mass until 1947, and Bierut's presidential oath in 1947 ended with the phrase 'so help me God'.\n\nThe Polish government made many concessions to the Church that antagonized Moscow; on the other hand, the campaign against the Church weakened their public support and made them dependent on the USSR. An important concession was the retention of religious instruction in schools, which was upheld from as early as 1945; at the same time, the state made manoeuvres to try to limit and eliminate such instruction through other means.\n\nBoleslaw Bierut, as part of a faction of the Polish Workers' Party (the Communist party in Poland) that favoured emulating the Soviet Union (Gomulka wanted to create a uniquely Polish system), took control in 1948 and attempted to turn Poland into a Stalinist state, wherein religion was actively discouraged in favour of Communism. This occurred during a general period of increasing control and repression in the Eastern bloc countries. The regime sought to eliminate the presence of Catholicism and religion from the culture, and to this effect it pursued a policy of isolation from the Vatican, creation of public opinion antagonistic to the Church, and provoking antagonisms within the Church itself by replacing religious leaders with others who worked with the regime. Marriage was secularized in 1945, and civil records were removed from the clergy's jurisdiction in 1949.\n\nPolish society was prepared for the persecutions post-1945 due to its long history prior to the Bolshevik revolution of operation under the rule of regimes that were hostile to it. Underground universities taught uncensored history and ethics lessons, and many people openly attended Church.\n\nA letter by the primate of Poland on elections, instructing Catholics not to support parties that were opposed to Catholic teaching, was suppressed in 1946.\n\nA notable feature of the antirelgious campaign in Poland included \"Patriot Priests\" who opposed the Church hierarchy and supported Communism. They were rewarded, and even sometimes allowed to travel to Rome. Some of them had experienced prison camps; some had been chaplains to the Red Army during World War II. The bishops often let them remain at their posts, although they were commonly ostracized by the laity; these priests failed to achieve much popular support. The state supported priests who collaborated with them; the remainder of the clergy was accused of reactionary activities, lack of solidarity with the nation and conspiracy with the Vatican.\n\nThe government achieved some success in these efforts; an estimated 1,700 out of 11,000 priests in Poland had attended conferences of the \"progressives\" by 1955. In 1949 the President of Communist Poland, Boleslaw Bierut, held a reception at the Belweder Palace in Warsaw for priests who were participating in a conference held by the Union of Fighters for Freedom and Democracy (ZBoWiD). At the conference some of the priests told Bierut that a lack of agreement between the hierarchy and the government made the work of clergy difficult. Bierut blamed this problem on the hierarchy:\n\nthe unfavourable attitude of higher Church authorities toward the People's state... In many cases one can hear from priests...words which are often simply criminal, anti-state.\n\nBierut gave cooperative priests privileges including vacations, financial support, tax exemption and protection from punishments under canon law (which were not forbidden by the state).\n\nFollowing this conference, a Commission of Priests attached to ZBoWiD was created, which in the following year commenced publication of a bi-weekly entitled Citizen Priest (Ksiadz obywatel), superseded in the same year by Priests' Forge (Kuznica kaplanska). They held conferences in almost all provincial capitals. Young priests were forced to enroll in special classes on Marxism, with the intention of causing a schism in the Church.\n\nThe state also attempted to penetrate the Church through the creation of several other organizations: the Polish Committee of Peace Partisans, the Catholic Social Club, and the Society of Children's Friends. The lay association, PAX, was founded under the leadership of Bolesław Piasecki, a leader of a pre-war fascist organization, and tried to remove the obligation of obedience to the hierarchy from members of the Church; this organization supported the regime's antireligious efforts, and also an anti-Semitic campaign in the late 1960s.\n\nThe ZBoWiD priests' commission supported the Peace Campaign, supported the government's protests against the remilitarization of West Germany, supported the planned economy, and said that the new constitution was fully in conformance with moral principles and Christian conscience. They gained mass popularity by supporting Poland's retention of the western territories which had been part of Germany.\n\nThe government failed to produce a schism in the Church due to lack of popular support, so they disbanded the organization in 1955 and called on people to instead join the movement for peace partisans.\n\nIn 1950 the Polish government created the Bureau for Religious Affairs, which had jurisdiction over personnel decisions and organisational functions.\n\nThe Main Commission of Intellectuals and Catholic Activists attached to the Peace Committee of Polish Partisans, was founded in 1950 and originally comprised members of theological faculties, representatives from the catholic university in Lublin and active Church workers. In 1950, this group participated in the second International Peace Congress in Warsaw. In 1951, this organization sponsored the first national conference of clergy and laymen representing Catholic public opinion. This organization attempted to mould public opinion and formulate principles pertaining to the behaviour of Catholics. It actively promoted the peace campaign, as well as government protests against remilitarization in West Germany and for support of holding the western territories. It criticized the Catholic Church in West Germany for allegedly being exploited for anti-Polish purposes.\n\nAnother organization, called the Catholic Social Club, that supported the regime and even had representation in the Polish parliament, however, it lacked popular support. It attempted to reconcile Catholic teaching with dialectical materialism.\n\nThe Society of Children's Friends (TPD) was created by the Communist Party in 1949 to secularize the public school system, and it established kindergartens, primary schools, teachers' colleges, camps and recreation centers for youth. A principle aim of the Society was to educate the youth as atheists and supporters of the regime. By 1950, the TPD had established more than 500 schools. The Catholic Church actively opposed the attempts to remove religious instruction, and Church influence, from public schools, and encouraged the faithful to support the church in its opposition. By 1956, religious education in public schools had been almost completely eliminated. The Soviet-style propaganda campaign created museums, associations and publications devoted to atheism.\n\nThe official press launched a campaign to safeguard Poland from subversion (this was in reference to the Vatican). The government conducted a propaganda campaign in the early years that depicted the Vatican and Polish hierarchy as germanophiles; the Vatican refused to change Poland's diocesan boundaries to mark the state's new territory.\n\nThe Vatican was often attacked in Polish propaganda as a negative influence on Poland, and claimed that Poland ceased to exist in the 18th century because the Vatican had weakened it. Propaganda also tried to link the Vatican with fascism, and claimed Pius XII was responsible for Franco's coup in Spain and the Vichy regime. Polish clergy loyal to the Vatican were also considered as fascists in the propaganda.\n\nThe Church signed an agreement with the government in 1950, after the old 1925 concordat was thrown away by the government on grounds that the Vatican had violated it by supporting Germany in World War II (the Vatican had allowed a German bishop in Danzig to have jurisdiction over Germans living in Poland). This agreement was not approved by the Vatican. This agreement contained some features favourable to the Church (which the government would not always observe in the following years), including the right to teach religion in schools and to allow children to receive religious instruction outside of the school, permitting the Catholic University of Lublin to continue operating, Catholic organizations still being permitted to exist, allowing the Catholic press to exist, allowing public worship in churches to continue to exist, allowing pilgrimages, allowing religious processions, allowing religious care in the armed forces, allowing monastic orders to continue to function and continuing to allow the Church to conduct charity work (many of these things had been outlawed in the neighbouring USSR, in great contrast). In return the state required the Church to submit to it politically and condemn Catholic activities that the state did not permit.\n\nIn 1952 the new Polish constitution was created, which did not include previously given protections to religion and the position of the Church in the country was worded ambiguously enough to allow for almost any new law of the Seym to not be in contradiction with it.\n\nPersecutions of individuals for religion in the first few years were rare, because the state initially was concerned strictly with suppressing armed political resistance. From 1947-1953, the Catholic Church in Poland became the primary target for persecution in Communist Poland. All social and charitable organizations affiliated with the church were made illegal ('Caritas' was taken over by the government in 1950), Catholic schools were closed, crosses were removed from classrooms and hospitals, and a terror campaign was enacted against parishes and monasteries; clergy began to be arrested and put on trial (this included the notable arrest of a group of Jesuits headed by Father Tomasz Rostworowski). Many bishops were arrested or removed from their positions, with government approved administrators then taking over the dioceses; in some cases the government sent people loyal to it to \"assist\" the bishop in running his diocese. About 900 priests were imprisoned. Nine priests were sentenced to death in 1949; in 1950 the Bonifratres Order and the Catholic charity Caritas were put on trial (the latter trial led to the government seizure in the same year).\n\nWhen the Vatican published its order excommunicating Catholics who actively supported communism in July 1949, the government called it an act of interference in Polish internal affairs and that clergy found trying to enforce the order (e.g. denying communion to excommunicated persons) would be punished by Polish law. The new law passed for this purpose in 1949 guaranteed the right of antireligious propaganda and also declared a penalty ranging from three years imprisonment to death, for those who abused the right of freedom of religious for 'purposes hostile to the system of the People's Republic'.\n\nThe already stressed relations between the Vatican and the Polish government deteriorated after that point, and the Polish government began to more actively strike the church; members of religious orders were required to register and give accounts of their activities as well as assets, and Catholic publications were more greatly suppressed.\n\nThe Minister of Justice commenting on the new legislation claimed he resented,\n\nSalesian schools and orphanages were closed. All Church private schools were closed by 1950; this was accomplished by the authorities simply refusing to grant work permits to the Catholic schools that applied for them (as religious instruction was still officially permitted, these means were instead used to eliminate Catholic education). Government-run private schools, of course, did not possess religious instruction; despite the provision in the 1950 agreement permitting religious instruction in schools, this right was being eroded. Marxism became an obligatory subject in the school system. Priests were dismissed from instructor positions for refusing to sign the Stockholm Peace Appeal, and nuns were barred from teaching in public schools, thereby leading to a common situation where other teachers were not available to give religious instruction; in some places the religious instruction was taken away on account of alleged demands of parents. By 1955 the only Catholic institution of higher learning still existent in Poland was the Catholic University of Lublin, which was being slowly liquidated by the regime. A total of 59 seminaries were closed between 1952–1956 and restrictions were imposed on training new priests. The Rozanystok seminary, which was created in 1949, was brutally liquidated in 1954. It had been moved from Wilno and had been run by Salesians for training candidates for the priesthood as well as for giving Catholic education for boys. The seminary was situated in Eastern Poland, it employed former residents of the territory annexed by the USSR in 1939, and it had arisen great concern to the government, provoking its brutal closure.\n\nMuch landed property was confiscated from the Church and affiliated organisations(the only land that was not taken away was the farmholdings of parish priests, provided this land did not exceed 50 hectares, or 100 hectares in some parts of the country), severe limitations were placed on charitable activities associated with the Church, and the government took control of the recording of vital statistics. In 1950, all Church property was nationalized without compensation, except that which was used by parish priests for their own subsistence (but such land could not exceed 50 hectares, and any income from such land had to be used religious and charitable purposes). This nationalization was accompanied by a promise from the state that it would set aside resources for the upkeep of parishes and clergy. The Church did not provide much resistance to this confiscation, thereby denying the communists the opportunity to attack the Church as an institution chiefly concerned with protecting its property (as Lenin had attempted with the Russian Orthodox Church). The government's confiscation led to the Church becoming even more popular among the lower classes.\n\nTwo priests who were sentenced in 1951 for being part of an underground organization opposed to the state provided ammunition for a new campaign in which the government began liquidating the temporary ecclesiastical administration in the western (former German) territories and removed apostolic administrators from these areas. The vatican began to appoint Polish bishops to these bishoprics after this point.\n\nIn May 1951 the clergy and government signed the \"National Charter for Peace Plebiscite\", following which subsequent trials were conducted, including notably against the Jesuit Order and St Bernard Order (leading to two death sentences). Three Salesian bishops, who were under heavy fire in the official propaganda, disappeared in 1952; in the same year several priests in Cracow were arrested on charges of espionage and sabotage. In January 1953, five dignitaries, including Archbishop Baziak in Cracow were arrested; public protests in Cracow were suppressed with violence.\n\nIn February 1953, four priests and three laymen were charged with espionage and put on trial. The government announced that, under the supposed pressure of public opinion aroused by the trial, they had to take control of the Church. Therefore, the government required all ecclesiastical posts to receive government approval. The government used this power, as well as other measures aimed at controlling the Church's activities in these years, to weaken the Church in order to aid in helping to remove it from society. Cardinal Primate of Poland, Stefan Wyzynski, attempted to manoeuvre around this obstacle by gaining permission from the Vatican to relax canonical rules in order to appoint parish administrators instead of pastors, since parish administrators were not subject to this government veto. The government claimed that it seldom used its power of veto, although Cardinal Wysynski in his role in appointing bishops reported that he found himself largely obstructed.\n\nWyszynski attempted to publish a letter protesting the government's treatment of the Church, and he was secretly arrested and put under house arrest (confined to a convent) in 1953; this followed from the arrest of a number of other bishops prior to his arrest (including the primate, 11 bishops were arrested in that year) including the trial of Bishop of Kielce Kaczmarek before the military tribunal in Warsaw (on charges of espionage). After this, the free bishops agreed to cooperate with the government's decree in February. This arrest later became public knowledge; the government offered to release him in 1955 if he stepped down from resuming his post as cardinal-primate.\n\nThe state tried to take control of the Polish Orthodox Church (with a membership of about half a million) in order to use it as a weapon against the Roman Catholic Church in Poland, and it attempted to control the person who was named as Metropolitan for the Polish Orthodox Church; Metropolitan Dionizy (the post-war head of the POC) was arrested and retired from service after his release.\n\nAfter the government's coming to power the prewar press legislation was abolished, the printing industry and plants were nationalized, and prepublication censorship was imposed. In July 1946, a government decree created the Central Office For Control of the Press, Publications and Public Performances under which all press and printing activities were controlled. Poland's vast and diverse Catholic press network from the pre-communist era was mostly eradicated, with the exception of some publications that continued to exist under heavy censorship, a reduction of their circulation and a requirement to only speak on purely religious matters (as opposed to political or social). Catholic publications that still existed included Tygodnik Warszawski (which was defiant to the regime and closed in 1949), Tygodnik Powszechny (whose editors resigned under pressure in 1953 after they failed to produce a correct obituary for Stalin, and pro-regime Catholics took over, but its old editors returned in 1956), and Dzi's i Jutro (a publication that attempted to promote coexistence of Catholicism and communism). This was a liberty that was not allowed to other places in the Soviet bloc (including the USSR most notably, which had banned church publications in 1929). The founders of Tygodnik Warszawski were incarcerated, of which Father Zygmunt Kaczynski and Antoni Antczak both died in prison. Cardinal Wyszynski attempted to intervene on behalf of Father Zygmunt.\n\nFollowing with the forcible conversion of Eastern Catholics in the USSR to Orthodoxy, the Polish government called on the Orthodox church in Poland to assume 'pastoral care' of the eastern Catholics in Poland. After the removal of Metropolitan Dionizy from leadership of the Polish Orthodox Church, Metropolitan Macarius was placed in charge. He was from western Ukraine (previously eastern Poland) and who had been instrumental in the compulsory conversion of eastern Catholics to orthodoxy there. Polish security forces assisted him in suppressing resistance in his taking control of Eastern Catholic parishes. Many eastern Catholics who remained in Poland after the postwar border adjustments were resettled in Western Poland in the newly acquired territories from Germany. The state in Poland gave the POC a greater number of privileges than the Roman Catholic Church in Poland; the state even gave money to this Church, although it often defaulted on promised payments, leading to a perpetual financial crisis for the POC.\n\nA period of de-stalinization occurring in the 1950s in the Eastern Bloc, as well as the recognition of the problems Communism was facing when faced with the unique situation in Poland, led to Wladyslaw Gomulka returning to power (he had earlier been the leader before he was replaced by Bierut in 1948). The state lightened its restrictions on the eastern Catholic churches which began to grow back, partly with assistance from the rest of the Catholics. The state moved away from its attempt to control and manipulate the Church for state purposes, as it had earlier planned in its first years of existence, and moved more towards a strategy of combatting it through legislation and force.\n\nDuring the events of the October revolution in 1956, the government was criticized by parts of the secular press and the loyalty of the Catholic press during these days, was returned in favour by Gomulka who lifted some restrictions placed on it. Cardinal Wyzsynski and other bishops were released from prison, five Catholic deputies were allowed to enter the Sejm, and monks and nuns were allowed to return to their monasteries. A new agreement was formed between the government and the Church, which resolved to remove previous anti-religious measures and once again renewed the Church's allegiance to the state. This was reneged, however, when within a few years Gomulka tightened his control and began restricting the Catholic press again. The Catholic press was then made incapable of responding to arguments against the Church in the secular press.\n\nIn 1957, Cardinal Wyszynski attempted to publish a Vatican decree condemning Catholics who collaborated with the government, but he was prevented by censorship. The Church also was unable to voice any opposition to birth control or abortion in its press.\n\nAbortion had initially remained restricted (as it had been in the prewar period, and for most of Poland's history), but was legalized in 1956 and further executive provisions were passed in 1959 that broadened access to abortions. This move contradicted the state's own obvious economic goals in regard to the massive labour shortage that continued to exist in the decades following the war (in which 22% of Poland's population died), but the legalization was used as an ideological weapon to strike the Church with, in order to undermine its influence in public society.\n\nThe state encouraged women to take a more active role in the paid labour force and in social life, partly as an attempt to undermine Church attitudes about a woman's role in family life.\n\nCatholic education came back to some extent in public schools after 1956, but was no longer compulsory (before when it was compulsory, school authorities usually did not make it compulsory) and only existed in schools where a majority of parents requested it, and it was regarded as an extracurricular activity outside of class hours; just as before, however, the state immediately took measures aimed at eroding this concession. All members of religious orders teaching in schools had their teaching licenses suspended and many lay teachers were also suspended from teaching, thus leaving many schools without teachers of religion and other indirect means were used to eliminate the legally permitted religious instruction in public schools. Approved teachers were subject to state inspection, and the curricula needed to have state approval. As the situation progressed, however, the state came to officially legally eliminate religious instruction in 1961.\n\nGomulka stated during the seventh plenary sessions of the Central Committee of that year: The school in People's Poland is a lay school. Its task is to train enlightened, superstition-free and rationally thinking citizens. The state authorities will not create obstacles for parents who want their children to receive religious education. However, in the interest . . . of all parents - believers and non-believers alike - these children should receive religious instruction outside the school.\n\nDespite Gomulka's statement, the state also created obstacles for teaching religion outside of the schools. The government frequently declared that buildings that held religious classes were unsafe and therefore were not granted permits. The government also issued legislation to limit such instruction to no more than 2 hours per week, that the religious instructors would be made state employees (the Church told the clergy not to register and accept salary to fulfill Jesus' commandment of teaching) and that local school boards would be in control of the education. These restrictions were initially reluctantly enforced, but in 1964 new legislation allowed all such buildings for religious instruction to be inspected for hygiene by the government, which reserved the right to shut them down on such grounds. Cardinal Wyzsynski protested the way this was carried out, and the government rebutted that it was only concerned with protecting students' health and safety.\n\nDiscriminatory policies were introduced against Catholics in both public and professional life.\n\nIn 1959 new tax laws were approved that limited the definition of what was included by the term 'worship' and sums given for things such as the primate's secretariat, seminaries or Catholic charities were no longer tax exempt. This led to the taxing of church donation money at the same level as private enterprise (65%). At some point, church buildings in the western territories were nationalized as post-German assets, and high rents were charged for their use.\n\nAlso in 1959, members of religious orders were no longer permitted to become parish priests or administrators, and they were also discharged from service at hospitals, public nurseries, dispensaries and kindergartens. Beginning in 1960, nuns were no longer permitted to study at universities or colleges. Many members of religious orders did also not have their declarations of residence accepted by the state. They generally had their civil rights eroded as the state discriminated against them.\n\nThe antireligious propaganda failed to find much popularity among the Polish masses. Despite the pressure placed on the church, the number of priests leaving seminaries actually attained higher levels in the 1950s than it had been in the pre-war years.\n\nFrom the 1960s onward Poland developed an increasingly vocal Catholic intelligentsia and an active movement of young Catholics. The \"Oasis\" movement, was created in the 1960s by Father Franciszek Blachniki, and it consisted of Church activities including pilgrimages, retreats and various ecumenical endeavours. Intense efforts by the state to undermine it failed.\n\nDuring Pope John XXIII's pontificate, the regime successfully bypassed the Polish episcopate by being allowed to directly negotiate with the vatican, which allowed the government to isolate the Polish episcopate. When Paul VI succeeded him, the new pope required further negotiations to go through the Polish episcopate.\n\nIn 1965, on the eve of Poland's 1000 year anniversary of its conversion to Christianity, the Polish episcopate made preparation for the event by inviting foreign guests including Pope Paul VI. In its letter to the German bishops, it controversially asked to forget about the past, grant forgiveness to Germans for occurrences during World War II and also asked for Poles to be forgiven for these occurrences too, and stated the Poland had been a bulwark of Christianity; the state took issue with the contents of the letter and it had not been cleared with the state when it was sent. It was declared opposed to the interests of Polish foreign policy. Gomulka stated that declaring Poland as the bulwark of Christianity was at odds with Poland's relationship with the Soviet Union and struck at the foundations of Poland's foreign policy.\n\nIn the midst of this crisis, the Polish episcopate was also criticized in the press for making no progressive contribution to the Second Vatican Council and Cardinal Wyszynski was reproached for supposedly calling \"for the condemnation of atheism, the preservation of the\nold, anti-socialist and pro-fascist social doctrine of the Church in all spheres of social life. \"\n\nTo punish the Church for its behaviour, several seminaries were closed and seminarians were made subject to the military draft, Wyszynski was denied privilege to travel to Rome and Paul VI was barred from coming to the Millennium celebrations. The government staged rival secular celebrations at the same time as the religious celebrations took place, in order to blunt enthusiasm in the religious celebrations.\n\nDespite all of this (and in contrast to the USSR), the number of parishes, priests and nuns reached higher figures than it had prior to the coming of Communism. The postwar church had 20,000,000 regular communicants.\n\nIn 1968, following the student uprisings, the Church was criticized for providing moral support to anti-Polish forces on account of its speaking up for human rights.\n\nBeginning in the early 1970s the Church moved from a defensive stance to a more aggressive stance in speaking in defence of human rights.\n\nIn 1970, Edward Gierek became the new leader of Poland, and he embarked on more relaxed policies with regard to anti-religious activity than his predecessors had. He established a personal working relationship with Stefan Wyszynski, authorized the building of new Churches and the resumption of instruction for priests in seminaries. In October 1977, he became the first Polish Communist leader to go to the Vatican and meet the pope (then Paul VI).\n\nThe security apparatus in Poland, as in other Communist nations, recruited members of the clergy. The security service used blackmail, psychological manipulation and a variety of material rewards (e.g. needed medicines for ill relatives) in order to secure the cooperation of clergy. In a reversal, the security service and Polish government had also members in its ranks who were secretly providing beneficial information to the Church\n\nCatholic youth were forced to enroll in Communist Youth organizations. Unlike in the CPSU (which was staunchly atheist), believers formed the majority of the membership of the Polish United Workers' Party, wherein almost 50% of party members practiced their faith at church (statistic from 1980).\n\nThe state encouraged the migration from rural areas towards cities, partly as an attempt to weaken the Church's influence. School curricula was modified to include more Marxist-Leninist ideas, new superintendents sympathetic to the party were appointed and later afternoon classes were created to hinder children from going to receive religious instruction.\n\nThe state came to increasingly change it approach to gender relations (earlier used to strike the Church with) in the later decades when woman's role in the family became more strongly emphasized in official propaganda and legislative measures were introduced to make it harder for women to find employment.\n\nAtheism never became widely accepted in Poland (as it had been in the USSR), and vast numbers of Poles continued to believe and even to attend Mass. Religious indifference became more common than atheism, but never achieved numbers larger than a small minority. However, at the same time, among believing Catholics, Catholic moral beliefs were eroded, with increasing numbers of people not accepting Church teaching on abortion or matrimonial/familial relations, and many Catholic Christians began thinking of morality being independent from religion as well as rejected the clergy's authority to issues directions regarding conscience.\n\nCardinal Primate of Poland, Stefan Wyszynski, believed that Poland had a special role to play in human history and he supported Polish nationalism as a precursor to the liberation of Eastern Europe from Soviet role. Such ideas were popular among many Polish Catholics as well. Wyszynski was brought into sharp conflict with the Communist authorities on account of this (he also experienced some conflict with the Vatican). He was very popular in Polish society, and he was defiantly referred to as 'interrex' (when Poland was an electoral monarchy, during the period when one monarch had died and before another was elected, the supreme power in the country was held by the Roman Catholic primate who was called 'interrex', this title therefore meant that there was no other legitimate government in Poland at the moment except the primate). He was both a critic of the regime and a mediator between the regime and the rest of civil society. Wyszynski provided a significant obstacle to the Communists taking control of the church in Poland; he died in 1981 and was replaced by Cardinal Josef Glemp.\n\nAfter Cardinal Wojtyla of Kraków became Pope John Paul II, his election was greeted in Poland with great enthusiasm. He visited Poland from June 2–10 in 1979. During his visit he bluntly challenged Communist ideology by declaring that Christianity was the route to true human freedom (as opposed to Marxism) and called people to non-conformance. Over thirteen million people went into the streets to greet him in his visit, in direct defiance to the Polish government. Dissidents in Poland and elsewhere in Eastern Europe took great notice to this fact. Radoslaw Sikorski in his memoir later said: \"We realized for the first time that 'we' were more numerous than 'them'.\"\n\nWhen visiting the satellite town of Mogila (location of the Mogiła Abbey) in Kraków, the Pope said: Christ never wants Man to be considered merely as a means of production. . . This should be remembered by the worker and the employer, by the work system as well as by the system of remuneration. It must be remembered by the State, the nation and the Church. . . For the sake of humanity the Church would like to reach an understanding with every work system, asking only to be permitted to speak to the individual human being about Christ and to love him according to his human dignity. . . In the spirit of fraternal solidarity and on the foundation of Christ's cross I, too, have shared in the building of the huge Polish works known as 'Nowa Huta' together with you, managers, engineers, miners, labourers, minister\n\nWithin a year the independent trade union 'Solidarity' was formed, which was initially based on economic concerns, but soon became a political movement affiliated with the Church. Jerzy Urban, government spokesman claimed: \"All the people's grievances against the power of the state were channelled into the Church and the election of a Pole as the Pope strengthened this religious propensity even further; when He came to Poland, I knew that this meant the end of a political epoch.\"\n\nThe Pope John Paul II promoted Poland's cause as well as the cause of Christians behind the Iron Curtain on an international level, to the great discomfort of the communist governments in the Warsaw pact. He rejected liberation theology, however, and kept the Church away from becoming too directly involved with politics. The church in Poland, nevertheless, played a key role in the revolution against the regime in the 1980s and provided symbols (the Black Madonna, the suffering Christ, etc.) that gave spiritual depth to the struggle against Communism; John Paul II's portrait with Mary became a popular icon in the struggle. It also provided spiritual and material comfort to striking workers, and acted as a mediator between the solidarity movement and the government.\n\nIt also held back the striking workers from excesses. The government allowed the broadcasting of Cardinal Wyzsynski's sermon to the striking workers broadcast on radio and television (although the cardinal's condemnation of the propagation of atheism was censored), wherein the cardinal called on the workers to end the strike. On many occasions, the primate (both Wyszynski and Glemp), as well as the Pope, called on Solidarity to be more cooperative and reasonable, and even criticized the trade union for actions taken.\n\nIn December 1981 martial law was imposed on Poland. This caused great trouble to the church, and many were rounded up by the military. Many in the Church defended the people who were arrested. The government nevertheless found that it required the church as a mediator in the crisis; General Jaruzelski in his first address to the Seym in 1982 stated:\n\nIn 1982 the Joint Committee of Episcopate and Church was reactivated, and began negotiations between the state and the church on its position in Poland. As a result of these negotiations, the state gave into some church demands including an improvement of status for diocesan seminaries, exemption of seminarians from military service, increased circulation of church newspapers, the return of the organization 'Caritas' to Church control, the broadcasting of the Sunday Mass and allowing the import and uncensored distribution of L'Osservatore Romano.\n\nThe Pope held great influence in the developing crisis in Poland; the Soviet press denounced the clergy in Poland during the crisis. An unsuccessful assassination attempt was made on the pope in 1981 in St Peter's square.\n\nThe Polish Orthodox Church hierarchy, which had had their position in society strengthened since 1945, spoke out against the Solidarity movement. They refused to send delegates to meetings about human rights issues. Some exceptions occurred, such as Fr Piotr Poplawski, an Orthodox priest openly sympathetic to Solidarity who \"killed himself\" in 1985; several doctors asked to confirm his suicide refused to certify this as the cause of death. A Roman Catholic priest named Jerzy Popiełuszko had been murdered by the police the previous year, and the doctor who performed his autopsy was brought in and also confirmed that Fr Piotr had committed suicide.\n\nDuring the government's problems with Solidarity, many parishes were used to help the grass-roots opposition to the regime, which occurred alongside growing attacks on priests by the state including brutality against priests (some of whom where murdered), breaking into churches and desecration as well as theft of religious objects.\n\nCommunist authorities blamed nationalist Catholics for fanning strife between Catholic and Orthodox populations.\n\nIn the Gdańsk accords, the Church was given permission to perform radio broadcasts. As the 80s progressed, the Church became increasingly critical of the regime and in the last years of the decade it played a critical role in the transition to democracy.\n\nIn Poland, Lech Wałęsa, Chairman of the Solidarity movement, then President of Poland summed up the contrasting Polish view of the Soviets and of Religion (specifically Catholicism) this way:\n\nThus, it is clear that Polish nationalists linked their struggle against the Soviet Union with a struggle against atheism.\nIn Hungary, following the Hungarian Revolution of 1956, one of the first actions of the resistance was to retrieve imprisoned Cardinal József Mindszenty; a large crowd took him to the episcopal palace in the city, and his first free action was to celebrate mass in honor of the resistance.\nIn Czechoslovakia, the 1968 Prague Spring provided a renewed Catholic resistance to the Soviets and the Soviet-led Orthodox control of Catholic lands, churches, and institutes. This inspired Ukrainian Greek-Catholics to renew their efforts to achieve official recognition from the Soviets.\n\n"}
{"id": "467894", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=467894", "title": "Prussian Settlement Commission", "text": "Prussian Settlement Commission\n\nThe Prussian Settlement Commission (; ) was a Prussian government commission that operated between 1886 and 1924, but actively only until 1918. It was set up by Otto von Bismarck to increase land ownership by Germans at the expense of Poles, by economic and political means, in the German Empire's eastern provinces of West Prussia and the Posen as part of his larger efforts aiming at the eradication of the Polish nation. The Commission was motivated by anti-Polish sentiment and racism.\n\nThe Commission was one of Prussia's prime instruments in the official policy of Germanization of the historically Polish lands of West Prussia (the former Royal Prussia) and the dissolved Grand Duchy of Posen. The Commission ultimately purchased 613 estates from German owners and 214 from Poles, functioning to more often bail out German debtors rather than fulfilling its declared national mission. By the end of its existence, a total of 21,886 German families (154,704 persons) out of a planned 40,000 had been settled. The Commission's activities had a countereffect in Poles using what has been termed \"defensive nationalism\", unifying \"Polish nationalism, Catholicism and cultural resistance\" and triggered Polish countermeasures, climaxing after World War I, when the Second Polish Republic was established, in the expropriation of Commission-owned lands and reversing Germanization. Some of the German colonists still remaining in Poland in 1939 were active in a Nazi campaign of genocide against Poles during World War II.\nEnglish translations include \"German Colonization Commission for Poznań\", \"Prussian Colonization Commission\"\"The Royal Commission of Colonization for West Prussia and Posnania\").\nThe majority of Polish sources translate the title as Colonization Commission rather than Settlement Commission, which is more politically charged.\nThe issue of translation is also connected to the fact that in 1904 the legal difference between settlement and colony was abolished in Prussia.\n\nThe Kingdom of Prussia during the partitions of Poland acquired West Prussia (, ) and the later Province of Posen (', '). The Polish language was abolished as an official language and the German language was introduced. Frederick the Great hoped to replace Poles with Germans, placing Germans in most of the administration as well. Poles were portrayed as \"backward Slavs\" by Prussian officials who acted to spread the German language and culture. The lands of Polish nobility were confiscated and given to German nobles. The Prussian hold on Polish areas was somewhat weakened after 1807 when parts of its partition were restored to the Duchy of Warsaw. The power status of Prussia was dependent on hindering any form of Polish statehood and it didn't support Polish attempts at restoration of Poland during Congress of Vienna, when Prussia tried to obtain the Duchy of Warsaw or at least its western provinces. In 1815 the Prussian king made several guarantees in his speech to Poles in the newly formed Grand Duchy of Posen (created out of territories of Duchy of Warsaw) in regards to rights of the Polish language and cultural institutions. However, in practice, the right to use Polish in courts and institutions was respected only until 1830. While the Poles constituted the majority of population in the area, they held only 4 out of 21 official posts of high level. Despite the colonizing actions between 1793 and 1806, in 1815 in Poznań only 11.1 per cent of the population was German. 5 After 1832 Poles could no longer hold high posts at the local administrative level (landrat). At the same time the Prussian government and Prussian King pursued Germanization of the administrative and judicial systems, while local officials enforced Germanization of the educational system and tried to eradicate the economic position of Polish nobility. The provincial parliament issued calls to ensure the right of use of the Polish language and called for the creation of Polish educational institutions as well as autonomy, but those requests were rejected by the Prussian state. In 1847 two hundred fifty seven Polish activists were imprisoned upon charges of conspiracy and eight of them were sentenced to death, \nthe Spring of Nations however stopped their execution. The Frankfurt Parliament showed that the German delegates refused to accept the rights of non-German peoples and, while the Prussian government declared itself ready to discuss Polish concerns, it soon ordered the Prussian military to crush the freedom movement of Polish activists and peasants. Afterwards, the victorious Prussian government retreated from its earlier declarations of autonomy in the Wielkpolska region.\n\nPrior to the Settlement Commission the Kingdom of Prussia had made a number of attempts to settle ethnic Germans in regions inhabited by Poles.\n\nFrederick the Great, who treated Poles with contempt and called them 'slovenly Polish trash', settled around 300,000 colonists in the eastern provinces of Prussia and aimed at a removal of the Polish nobility. Another colonization attempt aimed at Germanisation was pursued by Prussia after 1832.\n\nIn 1871, the German Empire was founded with Prussia being the leading and dominating state. The advent of the Kulturkampf marked a period, when the Prussian government attempted to Germanise the Poles through language, schooling, and religious restrictions. Later, the increase in the sheer numbers of Poles led the government to a direct anti-Polish demographic policy.\nThe Polish population in the province of Posen (Poznań) made up for nearly 60% (1,049,000 Poles vs 702,000 Germans in 1890), and in West Prussia for one third of the population (484,000 Poles vs 949,000 Germans in 1890). By 1885, Prussia still faced difficulties digesting her \"Polish provinces\", and the \"Polish Question\" was one of the Reich's most pressing problems. The state itself was led by German nationalism and Bismarck viewed Poles as one of the chief threat to German power; as he declared \"The Polish question is to us a question of life and death\" and wanted Polish nation to disappear in private going as far as expressing his wish to exterminate Poles As a result, the Polish population faced economic, religious and political discrimination the Germanisation of their territories was promoted and in places where Poles and Germans lived a virtual apartheid existed.\n\nIn the late 19th century, an east-to west migration (Ostflucht) took place, in which parts of the population of the eastern provinces migrated to western, more prosperous territories. \nThe German government was concerned that Ostflucht would lower the percentage of Germans in the eastern regions. This event was used as pretext and justification presented to the international community for actions aiming at Germanisation of those provinces. In reality both Poles, Jews and Germans moved to richer western German provinces \n\nThe goals of the Commission were the financial weakening of Polish landowners, and ensuring Germanisation of Polish cities as well as rural areas. The destruction of Polish landownership combined with the fight against the Polish clergy (Kulturkampf) was to achieve the elimination of a Polish national identity. Polish landowners were regarded by Bismarck as the principal agitators for Polish nationalism, purchasing their estates and parceling them out to Germans in family-sized farms was intended to both disestablish this group and significantly increase the numbers of Germans in these areas.\n\nThe focus on land ownership was motived by the German \"völkisch\" idea that \"where the German plough will plow, there German fatherland will arise\". The settlement was to isolate Polish settlements in German inhabited areas by surrounding them with German settlements and spread German ones into Polish dominated areas to isolate specified Polish villages from the rest. The German settlements were to be always concentrated to provide a \"barrier\" to Polishness. While the Commission bought mostly German land, this was not interfering with the goal of increase of German presence, and buying a large tract of land from a single German owner to distribute it among many German colonists was perceived as beneficial to the goal. Of the colonists, 96.9% were Protestants as the Prussian authorities believed that ‘the true German is a Protestant\". The whole practice was new and unheard in Europe. Besides Ostflucht, the German government justified its action to the international community by labeling Poles as internal enemies of the state. Those attempts didn’t achieve much success. Bismarck himself said that the Poles who find themselves without land should \"move to Morocco\".\n\nThe funding for the Commission was:\n\nBy 1914 the overall funding for the Commission was 955 million marks. Additional funds were awarded to assistance projects such crediting bankrupt German estates (125 million marks in 1908).\n\nDue to operations of the Commission the price of land in Polish territories rose in response. The economical attempt to Germanise those areas failed and with the beginning of World War I German authorities and leading members of Commission started to look for new ways to secure German foothold on Polish territory.\n\nWhile the commission planned to settle up to 40,000 families in Posen and West Prussia, it only managed to settle a total of 21,866 families until 1914, bringing the number of German colonists to 154,000.\n\nFrom 26 April 1886 until 1 January 1901, the Settlement Commission purchased 147,475 ha (3.64% of the Province of Posen and 1.65% of West Prussia), and settled 4,277 families (about 30,000 persons). A publication from German Empire named \"Meyers Großes Konversations-Lexikon\" claimed that in 1905-1906 that only 2,715 families were not native to these provinces. After this, the original budget of 100,000,000 marks was exhausted.\n\nBy 1913, the SC had bought up about 5.4% of the land in West Prussia and 10.4% in Posen. By then, 450 new villages were founded, a total area of 438,560 ha was purchased, of which 124,903 ha were purchased from Poles. In 1914, Germans owned 59% of land in Province of Posen, while making up for about 40% of population in 1890.\n\nThroughout its 32 years of existence the Commission was able to buy 8% of the total land in Posen and West Prussia. Altogether, about 22,000 families were settled, bringing the number of German colonists to 154,000. 5,400 families were German arrivals taken from other parts of the partitioned Poland, Congress Poland (Russian Empire province) and Galicia (Austrian province).\n\nOverall, the commission bought 828 estates (430,450 ha) for 443 million marks, 214 of those (115,525 ha) from Poles for 96,4 million marks, and the other 614 (314,926 ha) from Germans for 346,7 million marks. Further the commission bought 631 peasant farms (30,434 ha) for 44,5 million marks, 274 of those (11,152 ha) from Poles for 16,6 million marks and the other 357 (19,282 ha) from Germans for 27,9 million marks. Of the total of 955 million marks spent, about half (488 million marks) was spent for the actual land purchase, while the rest was spent for administration, parcellisation, infrastructure etc.\n\nTo Germanise the region predominantly German military units were sent and later included in the region's population figures.\nGermans from West Prussia and Greater Poland region who took part in the settlement process declined over time, while the number of Germans from the Russian Empire increased. In the first years (1886–90), locals from Greater Poland and West Prussia constituted 48% of the settlers while the proportion of Germans from Russia was below 1%, however in the years 1902-1906, locals only made up for 17% and Germans from Russia for 29% of the settlers.\n\nOf those settled until the end of 1906, a quarter originated in Posen and West Prussia, another quarter in the neighboring provinces of East Prussia, Pomerania, Brandenburg, Saxony and Silesia, 30% from other parts of the German Empire and 20% from outside the empire, especially from Russia.\n\nOne of the chief aims of the Commission was to stop the restoration of Polish population in Germanised territories of Greater Poland which was restoring its numbers after drastic fall during initial Prussian takeover. While the Commission never fully realised its goals, it managed to weaken Polish influence.\nIn Greater Poland the Polish share of the population didn't reach its pre-1815 levels:\n\nAccording to Władysław Kulski the Commission was only a part of the German efforts to eradicate Poles from territories conquered by Prussia from Poland;in addition to 154,000 colonists, Germany also settled 378,000 German military personnel and officials in Polish territories.\n\nAs the economic approach showed to be a failure, various laws were enacted to promote the Settlement Commission's aims.\n\n\nOther measures in support of the Germanisation policy included:\n\nThe creation of the Commission stimulated Poles to take countermeasures, that gradually turned into a competition of the Polish minority against the German state with Poles running their own settlement banks and settlement societies, resulting in a \"battle for soil\" (\"Kampf um den Boden\"). In 1888 Teodor Kalkstein founded Bank Ziemski, supported by Poles from Austrian Galicia region. 1894 saw Polish intellectuals in cooperation with Polish farmers founding \"Spólka Rolników Indywidualnych\". Ignacy Sikorski founded \"Bank Parcelacyjny\" in 1896. From 1890 till 1912 Polish enterprises, banks and associations grew in number and strength providing Poles with defence against the Germanisation of their land. The efforts to Germanise the region in fact strengthened the Polish nationalist movement and united Polish nationalism, Catholicism and cultural resistance among the Poles in Pomerania, Masuria and Silesia. For the Settlement Commission, these countermeasures led to a decreasing availability of purchasable Polish-owned land, in 1895 and all years following 1898, the vast majority of estates was purchased from Germans instead of Poles, and since 1902, the commission was able to acquire land from Poles \"only rarely and only through a middleman\".\n\nNumerous initiatives proved to be more elastic and efficient then the large centralised German bureaucracy. A social understanding has risen among the Polish population that led to abandoning the class differences in order to defend national existence - the rich helped the poor to perform better in economy and were supported by the clergy in their actions. Rich nobility often sold their artistic heritage to invest in banking and financial enterprises, or to buy more land for Poles. This was viewed as moral and ethical behavior among the Polish population. Some Polish nationalists accused the Settlement Commission of being run by Germans and Jews, and distributed a leaflet in 1912 that warned \"any Pole who buys from Jews and Germans undermines the existence of the Catholic Church and the Fatherland.\" Local newspapers attempted to intimidate residents who purchased goods from German and Jewish merchants by publishing their names in the paper and accusing them of \"betray[ing]...their country.\"\n\nAs a result, the German initiative created the very thing it tried to eliminate in the first place, a Polish national awakening in the Greater Poland region (province of Posen) and feeling of Polish national unity.\nThus, faced with the inability to Germanise the Polish provinces by economic means led the German leaders and thinkers to consider pursuing extraordinary means. Catherine Epstein named Polish resistance to German methods as strengthening Polish nationalism and notes the similarity of Commission actions to the Nazis\n\nEven before the First World War some Germans like Hans Delbrück or Chancellor Bernhard von Bülow proposed expelling Poles from eastern territories of Germany. With the coming of the war, those ideas begun to take real and determined form in the shape of plans to be realised after German victory and as consequence hegemony of Central and Eastern Europe. The idea of extraordinary measures was the result of the failed economic attempt to Germanise Polish provinces. Heads of the Settlement Commission were among the architects and supporters of those plans. The president of the Settlement Commission, Gense, was one of the chief supporters and planners of the so-called \"Polish Border Strip\" that envisioned expelling circa 2 million non-Germans (chiefly Poles and Jews) from 30,000 square kilometers of the would-be annexed territories from Congress Poland, which would then become Germanised. The Poles remaining in Germany who would refuse to become Germanised were to be \"encouraged\" to move to a planned German-run Polish puppet state established from the remains of Congress Poland.\n\nOther notable names of Settlement Commission activists include Friedrich von Schwerin and industrialist Alfred Hugenberg who worked for and represented the Krupp family.\n\nThe Settlement Commission's goal to Germanise Polish territories failed and with the fall of German Empire in 1918 (at the end of World War I), the Commission ceased to function by 1924. In 1919 its headquarters were taken over by Polish state as well as most of its territory. 3.9% (18,200 ha.) of all the land purchased remained in the hands of the Germans within the new borders of Germany. The Germanisation policies resulted in strong measures against the German settlers by the Polish state after World War I. The Polish state refused to recognize the ownership rights of most of the German settlers, about half of whom fled or were driven out of Poland. These actions of the Polish state were condemned by the Permanent Court of International Justice, ruling out in 1923 \"that the position adopted by the Polish Government [...] was not in conformity with its international obligations.\". By 1918, the total ethnic Polish population was greater than when the Commission began operations. Between 1918 and 1939, the German population in these areas declined by another 70%, and the land owned by Germans by 45%.\n\nPrussian policies of settlement and forced assimilation were an influence for German Nazi thinkers during their war in the East Their plans were a renovation of the idea, this time however rather than colonize just the land purchased by Prussian Settlement Commission, Poles would be ethnically cleansed and murdered, and German colonists would occupy their place.\nThe Nazis planned also to form a Reich Settlement Commission to coordinate all internal colonization within German Reich, which was to be based on Prussian Settlement Commission. The plan was laid out by Nazi official Curt von Gottberg, who presented it to Himmler, and as reward was appointed as Land Registry Chief in Prague in June 1939\n\n\n"}
{"id": "704177", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=704177", "title": "Push poll", "text": "Push poll\n\nA push poll is an interactive marketing technique, most commonly employed during political campaigning, in which an individual or organization attempts to manipulate or alter prospective voters' views/beliefs under the guise of conducting an opinion poll.\n\nIn a push poll, large numbers of voters are contacted with little effort made to actually collect and analyze voters' response data. Instead, the push poll is a form of telemarketing-based propaganda and rumor mongering, masquerading as an opinion poll. Push polls may rely on innuendo, or information gleaned from opposition research on the political opponent of the interests behind the poll.\n\nPush polls are generally viewed as a form of negative campaigning. Indeed, the term is commonly (and confusingly) used in a broader sense to refer to legitimate polls that aim to test negative political messages. Future usage of the term will determine whether the strict or broad definition becomes the most favored definition. However, in all such polls, the pollster asks leading questions or suggestive questions that \"push\" the interviewee towards adopting an unfavourable response towards the political candidate in question.\n\nLegislation in Australia's Northern Territory defined push-polling as any activity conducted as part of a telephone call made, or a meeting held, during the election period for an election, that: (a) is, or appears to be, a survey (for example, a telephone opinion call or telemarketing call); and (b) is intended to influence an elector in deciding his or her vote.\n\nPush polling has been condemned by the American Association of Political Consultants and the American Association for Public Opinion Research.\n\nRichard Nixon was one of push polling's pioneers. In his very first campaign, a successful 1946 run for the U.S. House against Democrat incumbent Jerry Voorhis, Democratic voters throughout the district reported receiving telephone calls that began: \"This is a friend of yours, but I can't tell you who I am. Did you know that Jerry Voorhis is a communist?\" (he wasn't) – at which point the caller hung up. A citizen later came forward admitting that she worked for Nixon for $9 a day, in a telephone-bank room where the attack calls were made.\n\nThe mildest forms of push polling are designed merely to remind voters of a particular issue. For instance, a push poll might ask respondents to rank candidates based on their support of an issue in order to get voters thinking about that issue.\n\nMany push polls are negative attacks on other candidates. These attacks often contain suggestions not stated as facts. They ask questions such as \"If you knew that Candidate Smith was being investigated for corruption, would you be more likely to vote for him, or less likely?\" The question does not state that any investigation has taken place, so it is not a lie, but it puts in the respondent's mind the idea that Candidate Smith may be corrupt.\n\nTrue push polls tend to be very short, with only a handful of questions, to maximise the number of calls that can be made. Any data obtained (if used at all) is secondary in importance to negatively affecting the targeted candidate. Legitimate polls are often used by candidates to test potential messages. They frequently ask about either positive and negative statements about any or all major candidates in an election and always include demographic questions.\n\nThe main advantage of push polls is that they are an effective way of maligning an opponent (\"pushing\" voters towards a predetermined point of view) while avoiding direct responsibility for the distorted or false information suggested (but not directly alleged) in the push poll. They are risky for this same reason: if credible evidence emerges that the polls were directly ordered by a campaign or candidate, it could do serious damage to that campaign. Push polls are also relatively expensive, having a far higher cost per voter than radio or television commercials. Consequently, push polls are most used in elections with fewer voters, such as party primaries, or in close elections where a relatively small change in votes can make the difference between victory or defeat.\n\nIn March 2011, \"The Daily Telegraph\" reported that the Australian Labor Party was referred to the New South Wales Electoral Commission after it was alleged to have used \"push polling\" in Newcastle to discredit independent candidate John Stuart Tate. Labor Party officials employed a market research firm to conduct the polling, telling voters that Tate was the Labor mayor of Newcastle, when in fact he was not. It has been suggested that Labor was worried its brand was so damaged in one of its traditional seats that it branded the popular independent as one of its own to discredit him. Labor polling firm Fieldworks Market Research admitted to the \"Telegraph\" reporter that the script used when calling voters branded Tate a \"Labor\" candidate, but said the script was provided by the Labor Party. It is not known, at least in public, whether the Electoral Commission responded to this referral.\n\nGeorge W. Bush had used push polls in his 1994 bid for Texas Governor against incumbent Ann Richards. Callers asked voters \"whether they would be more or less likely to vote for Governor Richards if they knew that lesbians dominated on her staff.\"\n\nIn the 2000 United States Republican Party primaries, it was alleged that George W. Bush's campaign used push polling against the campaign of Senator John McCain. Voters in South Carolina reportedly were asked \"Would you be more likely or less likely to vote for John McCain for president if you knew he had fathered an illegitimate black child?\" This hypothetical question seemed like a suggestion, although without substance. It was heard by thousands of primary voters. McCain and his wife had in fact adopted a girl from Bangladesh.\n\nIn the 2008 presidential election, Jewish voters in several states were targeted by various push polls that linked Barack Obama to various anti-Israel positions. For example, various push polls suggested that Obama was a Muslim; Obama's church was anti-American and anti-Israel; Obama often met pro-Palestinian leaders in Chicago (and had met PLO leaders); a Hamas leader had endorsed an Obama victory; and that Obama had called for a summit of Muslim nations excluding Israel if elected president. The Jewish Council for Education & Research, an organization that endorsed Obama, denounced the push polls as disinformation and lies.\n\nPolitical consultant Lee Atwater was also well known for using push-polling among his aggressive campaign tactics, though apologised for this in later life.\n\nAmid widespread controversy over the Trump administration's executive order restricting immigration from the middle east, the GOP sent out a poll to supporters on February 17, 2017 titled \"Mainstream Media Accountability\" which included such questions as \"Do you believe that the media unfairly reported on President Trump’s executive order temporarily restricting people entering our country from nations compromised by radical Islamic terrorism?\" and \"Were you aware that a poll was released revealing that a majority of Americans actually supported President Trump's temporary restriction executive order?\" \n\nThe state legislature has attempted to restrict the practice in New Hampshire.\n\nThe parliament of the Northern Territory (Australia) has legislated to restrict push polling in that, during an election, the caller is required to identify his/her name and address.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "56522", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=56522", "title": "Right-wing politics", "text": "Right-wing politics\n\nRight-wing politics hold that certain social orders and hierarchies are inevitable, natural, normal or desirable, typically supporting this position on the basis of natural law, economics or tradition. Hierarchy and inequality may be viewed as natural results of traditional social differences or the competition in market economies. The term right-wing can generally refer to \"the conservative or reactionary section of a political party or system\".\n\nThe political terms \"Left\" and \"Right\" were first used during the French Revolution (1789–1799) and referred to seating arrangements in the French parliament: those who sat to the right of the chair of the parliamentary president were broadly supportive of the institutions of the monarchist Old Regime. The original Right in France was formed as a reaction against the \"Left\" and comprised those politicians supporting hierarchy, tradition and clericalism. The use of the expression (\"the right\") became prominent in France after the restoration of the monarchy in 1815, when it was applied to the Ultra-royalists. The people of English-speaking countries did not apply the terms \"right\" and \"left\" to their own politics until the 20th century.\n\nAlthough the right-wing originated with traditional conservatives, monarchists and reactionaries, the term extreme right-wing has also been applied to movements including fascism, nazism and racial supremacy. From the 1830s to the 1880s, there was a shift in the Western world of social class structure and the economy, moving away from nobility and aristocracy towards capitalism. This general economic shift toward capitalism affected centre-right movements such as the British Conservative Party, which responded by becoming supportive of capitalism. In the United States, the Right includes both economic and social conservatives. In Europe, economic conservatives are usually considered liberal and the Right includes nationalists, nativist opposition to immigration, religious conservatives and historically a significant presence of right-wing movements with anti-capitalist sentiments including conservatives and fascists who opposed what they saw as the selfishness and excessive materialism inherent in contemporary capitalism.\n\nThe political term right-wing was first used during the French Revolution, when liberal deputies of the Third Estate generally sat to the left of the president's chair, a custom that began in the Estates General of 1789. The nobility, members of the Second Estate, generally sat to the right. In the successive legislative assemblies, monarchists who supported the Old Regime were commonly referred to as rightists because they sat on the right side. A major figure on the right was Joseph de Maistre, who argued for an authoritarian form of conservatism. Throughout the 19th century, the main line dividing Left and Right in France was between supporters of the republic (often secularists) and supporters of the monarchy (often Catholics). On the right, the Legitimists and Ultra-royalists held counter-revolutionary views, while the Orléanists hoped to create a constitutional monarchy under their preferred branch of the royal family, a brief reality after the 1830 July Revolution. The centre-right Gaullists in post-World War II France advocated considerable social spending on education and infrastructure development as well as extensive economic regulation, but limited the wealth redistribution measures characteristic of social democracy.\n\nIn British politics, the terms \"right\" and \"left\" came into common use for the first time in the late 1930s in debates over the Spanish Civil War.\n\nThe Right has gone through five distinct historical stages: (I) the reactionary right sought a return to aristocracy and established religion; (II) the moderate right distrusted intellectuals and sought limited government; (III) the radical right favored a romantic and aggressive nationalism; (IV) the extreme right proposed anti-immigration policies and implicit racism; and (V) the neo-liberal right sought to combine a market economy and economic deregulation with the traditional right-wing beliefs in patriotism, elitism and law and order.\n\nThe meaning of right-wing \"varies across societies, historical epochs, and political systems and ideologies\". According to \"The Concise Oxford Dictionary of Politics\", in liberal democracies, the political right opposes socialism and social democracy. Right-wing parties include conservatives, Christian democrats, classical liberals, nationalists and on the far-right; racists and fascists.\n\nRoger Eatwell and Neal O'Sullivan divide the right into five types: reactionary, moderate, radical, extreme and new. Chip Berlet argues that each of these \"styles of thought\" are \"responses to the left\", including liberalism and socialism, which have arisen since the 1789 French Revolution. The reactionary right looks toward the past and is \"aristocratic, religious and authoritarian\". The moderate right, typified by the writings of Edmund Burke, is tolerant of change, provided it is gradual and accepts some aspects of liberalism, including the rule of law and capitalism, although it sees radical \"laissez-faire\" and individualism as harmful to society. The moderate right often promotes nationalism and social welfare policies. Radical right is a term developed after World War II to describe groups and ideologies such as McCarthyism, the John Birch Society, Thatcherism and the Republikaner Party. Eatwell stresses that this use has \"major typological problems\" and that the term \"has also been applied to clearly democratic developments\". The radical right includes right-wing populism and various other subtypes. Eatwell argues that the extreme right' has four traits: \"1) anti-democracy; 2) nationalism; 3) racism; and 4) the strong state\". The New Right consists of the liberal conservatives, who stress small government, free markets and individual initiative.\n\nOther authors make a distinction between the centre-right and the far-right. Parties of the centre-right generally support liberal democracy, capitalism, the market economy (though they may accept government regulation to control monopolies), private property rights and a limited welfare state (for example, government provision of education and medical care). They support conservatism and economic liberalism and oppose socialism and communism. By contrast, the phrase \"far-right\" is used to describe those who favor an absolutist government, which uses the power of the state to support the dominant ethnic group or religion and often to criminalize other ethnic groups or religions. Typical examples of leaders to whom the far-right label is often applied are: Francisco Franco in Spain, Benito Mussolini in Italy, Adolf Hitler in Nazi Germany and Augusto Pinochet in Chile.\n\nThe United States Department of Homeland Security defines right-wing extremism in the United States as \"broadly divided into those groups, movements, and adherents that are primarily hate-oriented (based on hatred of particular religious, racial or ethnic groups), and those that are mainly anti-government, rejecting federal authority in favor of state or local authority, or rejecting government authority entirely. It may include groups and individuals that are dedicated to a single issue, such as opposition to abortion or immigration.\" \n\nRight-wing politics involves in varying degrees the rejection of some egalitarian objectives of left-wing politics, claiming either that social or economic inequality is natural and inevitable or that it is beneficial to society. Right-wing ideologies and movements support social order. The original French right-wing was called \"the party of order\" and held that France needed a strong political leader to keep order. British conservative scholar R. J. White, who rejects egalitarianism, wrote: \"Men are equal before God and the laws, but unequal in all else; hierarchy is the order of nature, and privilege is the reward of honourable service\". American conservative Russell Kirk also rejected egalitarianism as imposing sameness, stating: \"Men are created different; and a government that ignores this law becomes an unjust government for it sacrifices nobility to mediocrity\". Kirk took as one of the \"canons\" of conservatism the principle that \"civilized society requires orders and classes\". Right libertarians reject collective or state-imposed equality as undermining reward for personal merit, initiative and enterprise. In their view, it is unjust, limits personal freedom and leads to social uniformity and mediocrity.\n\nThe original use of \"right-wing\" in reference to communism had the conservatives on the right, the liberals in the centre and the communists on the left. Both the conservatives and the liberals were strongly anti-communist. The history of the use of the term \"right-wing\" to mean anti-communist is a complicated one.\n\nEarly Marxist movements were at odds with the traditional monarchies that ruled over much of the European continent at the time. Many European monarchies outlawed the public expression of communist views and the \"Communist Manifesto\", which began \"[a] spectre [that] is haunting Europe\", stated that monarchs feared for their thrones. Advocacy of communism was illegal in the Russian Empire, the German Empire and Austria-Hungary, the three most powerful monarchies in continental Europe prior to World War I. Many monarchists (except constitutional monarchists) viewed inequality in wealth and political power as resulting from a divine natural order. The struggle between monarchists and communists was often described as a struggle between the Right and the Left.\n\nBy World War I, in most European monarchies, the divine right of kings had become discredited and replaced by liberal and nationalist movements. Most European monarchs became figureheads or accepted a lesser degree of powers while elected governments held the day-to-day power. The most conservative European monarchy, the Russian Empire, was replaced by the communist Soviet Union. The Russian Revolution inspired a series of other communist revolutions across Europe in the years 1917–1922. Many of these, such as the German Revolution, were defeated by nationalist and monarchist military units. In this period, nationalism began to be considered right-wing, especially when it opposed the internationalism of the communists.\n\nThe 1920s and 1930s saw the fading of traditional right-wing politics. The mantle of conservative anti-communism was taken up by the rising fascist movements on the one hand and by American-inspired liberal conservatives on the other. When communist groups and political parties began appearing around the world, their opponents were usually colonial authorities and the term right-wing came to be applied to colonialism.\n\nAfter World War II, communism became a global phenomenon and anti-communism became an integral part of the domestic and foreign policies of the United States and its NATO allies. Conservatism in the post-war era abandoned its monarchist and aristocratic roots, focusing instead on patriotism, religious values and nationalism. Throughout the Cold War, colonial governments in Asia, Africa and Latin America turned to the United States for political and economic support. Communists were also enemies of capitalism, portraying Wall Street as the oppressor of the masses. The United States made anti-communism the top priority of its foreign policy and many American conservatives sought to combat what they saw as communist influence at home. This led to the adoption of a number of domestic policies that are collectively known under the term \"McCarthyism\". While both liberals and conservatives were anti-communist, the followers of Senator McCarthy were called right-wing and those on the right called liberals who favored free speech, even for communists; leftist.\n\nIn France after the French Revolution, the Right fought against the rising power of those who had grown rich through commerce and sought to preserve the rights of the hereditary nobility. They were uncomfortable with capitalism, the Enlightenment, individualism and industrialism and fought to retain traditional social hierarchies and institutions. In Europe's history, there have been strong collectivist right-wing movements, such as in the social Catholic right that has exhibited hostility to all forms of liberalism (including economic liberalism) and has historically advocated for paternalist class harmony involving an organic-hierarchical society where workers are protected while hierarchy of classes remain.\n\nIn the nineteenth century, the Right had shifted to support the newly rich in some European countries (particularly England) and instead of favouring the nobility over industrialists, favoured capitalists over the working class. Other right-wing movements, such as Carlism in Spain and nationalist movements in France, Germany and Russia, remained hostile to capitalism and industrialism. However, there are still a few right-wing movements today, notably the French Nouvelle Droite, CasaPound and American paleoconservatives, that are often in opposition to capitalist ethics and the effects they have on society as a whole, which they see as infringing upon or causing the decay of social traditions or hierarchies that they see as essential for social order.\n\nIn modern times, \"right-wing\" is sometimes used to describe \"laissez-faire\" capitalism. In Europe, capitalists formed alliances with the Right during their conflicts with workers after 1848. In France, the Right's support of capitalism can be traced to the late-nineteenth century. The so-called neoliberal Right, popularised by US President Ronald Reagan and UK Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher, combines support for free markets, privatisation and deregulation with traditional right-wing support for social conformity. Right-wing libertarianism (sometimes known as libertarian conservatism or conservative libertarianism) supports a decentralised economy based on economic freedom and holds property rights, free markets and free trade to be the most important kinds of freedom. Russell Kirk believed that freedom and property rights were interlinked. Anthony Gregory has written that right-wing libertarianism \"can refer to any number of varying and at times mutually exclusive political orientations\". Gregory holds that the issue is neither right or left, but \"whether a person sees the state as a major hazard or just another institution to be reformed and directed toward a political goal\".\n\nConservative authoritarians and those on the far-right have supported fascism and corporatism.\n\nIn France, nationalism was originally a left-wing and Republican ideology. After the period of \"boulangisme\" and the Dreyfus Affair, nationalism became a trait of the right-wing. Right-wing nationalists sought to define and defend a \"true\" national identity from elements deemed to be corrupting that identity. Some were supremacists, who in accordance with social Darwinism applied the concept of \"survival of the fittest\" to nations and races. Right-wing nationalism was influenced by Romantic nationalism, in which the state derives its political legitimacy from the organic unity of those it governs. This generally includes the language, race, culture, religion and customs of the nation, all of which were \"born\" within its culture. Linked with right-wing nationalism is cultural conservatism, which supports the preservation of the heritage of a nation or culture and often sees deviations from cultural norms as an existential threat.\n\nRight-wing politics typically justifies a hierarchical society on the basis of natural law or tradition.\n\nTraditionalism was advocated by a group of United States university professors (labeled the \"New Conservatives\" by the popular press) who rejected the concepts of individualism, liberalism, modernity and social progress, seeking instead to promote what they identified as cultural and educational renewal and a revived interest in what T. S. Eliot referred to as \"the permanent things\" (concepts perceived by traditionalists as truths that endure from age to age alongside basic institutions of western society such as the church, the family, the state and business).\n\nRight-wing populism is a combination of civic/ethno-nationalism with anti-elitism, using populist rhetoric to provide a radical critique of existing political institutions. According to Margaret Canovan, a right-wing populist is \"a charismatic leader, using the tactics of politicians' populism to go past the politicians and intellectual elite and appeal to the reactionary sentiments of the populace, often buttressing his claim to speak for the people by the use of referendums\".\n\nIn Europe, right-wing populism often takes the form of distrust of the European Union and of politicians in general combined with anti-immigrant rhetoric and a call for a return to traditional, national values. In the United States, the Tea Party movement states that the core beliefs for membership are the primacy of individual liberties as defined in the Constitution of the United States, small federal government and respect for the rule of law. Some policy positions include an opposition to illegal immigration, a strong national military force, the right to individual gun ownership, cutting taxes, reducing government spending and balancing the budget.\n\nGovernment support for an established religion was associated with the original French Right. Joseph de Maistre argued for the indirect authority of the Pope over temporal matters. According to Maistre, only governments founded upon a Christian constitution, implicit in the customs and institutions of all European societies and especially in Catholic European monarchies, could avoid the disorder and bloodshed that followed the implementation of rationalist political programs, as in the French Revolution. The Church of England was established by Henry VIII and some churchmen are given seats in the House of Lords, but are considered politically neutral rather than being specifically right or left-wing.\n\nReligious fundamentalists frequently feel that governments should enact laws supporting their religious tenets. The Christian right is a major force in North America. They generally support laws upholding what they consider religious values, such as opposition to abortion, contraception, sex outside marriage and to same-sex marriage and reject scientific positions on evolution and other matters where science disagrees with the Bible. Outside the West, some other religious and ethnicity based political groups are considered right-wing. In India, Hindu nationalism is sometimes considered a part of the Right. The Hindu nationalist movement has attracted privileged groups fearing encroachment on their dominant positions and also \"plebeian\" and impoverished groups seeking recognition around a majoritarian rhetoric of cultural pride, order and national strength. Many Islamist groups have been called \"right-wing\" including the Great Union Party and the Combatant Clergy Association/Association of Militant Clergy and the Islamic Society of Engineers of Iran.\n\nThe term \"family values\" has been used as a buzzword by right-wing parties such as the Republican Party in the United States, the Family First Party in Australia, the Conservative Party in the United Kingdom and the Bharatiya Janata Party in India to describe support for traditional families and opposition to the changes the modern world has made in how families live. Right-wing supporters of \"family values\" may oppose abortion, euthanasia, the increasing cultural acceptance of homosexuality, divorce, teenage pregnancy and adultery.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "623236", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=623236", "title": "Russification of Finland", "text": "Russification of Finland\n\nThe policy of Russification of Finland (Finnish: \"sortokaudet/sortovuodet\" - times/years of oppression) was a governmental policy of the Russian Empire aimed at limiting the special status of the Grand Duchy of Finland and possibly the termination of its political autonomy and cultural uniqueness in 1899–1905 and in 1908–1917. It was a part of a larger policy of Russification pursued by late 19th–early 20th century Russian governments which tried to abolish cultural and administrative autonomy of non-Russian minorities within the empire.\n\nThe two Russification campaigns evoked widespread Finnish resistance, starting with petitions and escalating to strikes, passive resistance (including draft resistance) and eventually active resistance. Finnish opposition to Russification was one of the main factors that ultimately led to Finland's declaration of independence in 1917.\n\nRussia attacked Sweden in 1808, in what became later known as the \"War of Finland\". In 1809 the lost territory of Sweden became the Grand Duchy of Finland in the Russian Empire. In 1809 the Finnish Diet recognized Tsar Alexander I as Grand Duke. For his part, Alexander confirmed the rights of the Finns, in particular, promising freedom to pursue their customs and religion and to maintain their identity:\n\nThis promise was maintained; indeed, Alexander II amplified the powers of the Finnish diet in 1869. Having enjoyed prosperity and control over their own affairs, and having remained loyal subjects for nearly a century, the manifesto which Nicholas II issued on 15 February 1899 was cause for Finnish despair. The manifesto was forced through the Finnish senate by the deciding vote of the senate president, an appointee of the tsar—and after the governor-general of Finland, Nikolay Bobrikov, had threatened a military invasion and siege. While ostensibly affirming the Finns' rights in purely local matters, the manifesto asserted the authority of the state in any and all matters which could be considered to \"come within the scope of the general legislation of the empire.\"\n\nAs a response to manifesto, a petition with 523,000 names was gathered and a delegation of 500 people were sent to deliver it to the tsar. A separate petition called \"Pro Finlandia\" that contained the names of 1,050 prominent foreign people was also gathered few months later.\n\nRussification policies enacted included:\n\n\nFrom April 1903 until the Russian Revolution of 1905, the governor-general was granted dictatorial powers. Bobrikov used these powers by personally abolishing several newspapers and deporting notable Finnish political leaders. In June 1904 Eugen Schauman assassinated Bobrikov, the incumbent. The imperial government responded with a purge of opponents of Russification within the Finnish administration and more stringent censorship. However the passive resistance campaign also had some successes, notably a \"de facto\" reversal of the new conscription law.\n\nThe Russification campaign was suspended and partially reversed in 1905–07 during a period of civil unrest throughout the Russian empire following Russian defeats in the Russo-Japanese War.\n\nThe program was reintroduced in 1908 on, costing Finland much of its autonomy and again causing further Finnish resistance, including the Jäger movement. During 1909–1917 the Finnish politicians in the Senate of Finland were replaced by Finnish-born officers of the Russian army who were formally subjects of the Grand Duchy, creating the so-called \"admiral-senate\" or \"saber-senate\". Russia demanded higher payments for not conscripting Finns (issue of \"sotilasmiljoonat\", \"Military millions\"). The 1910 \"Law of all-Empire legislation procedures\" removed most of Finnish legislation from the newly established Finnish Parliament to the Russian Duma and State Council. In 1912 they passed \"Law of equality\" which opened all Finnish government and civil service offices to Russians.\n\nMany measures were again suspended in 1914–17 during the First World War, but secret government documents published in the Finnish press in November 1914 suggested that the imperial government still harbored plans for the complete Russification of Finland.\n\nSecond wave halted due to February Revolution in Russia.\n\nDuring the Russo–Japanese War with the financial aid from Japan the rebels bought a shipment of thousands of rifles with the aim of creating an uprising and forming an independent state. However, the ship was wrecked off the coast of Finland and the plan fell apart. During the First World War when Russia and Japan were allies fighting against Germany, the Japanese handed to the Russian government a list of leading men in the freedom movement (now in World War I working with Imperial Germany).\n\n\n\n"}

China was later discovered to have facilitated his arrest by providing his personal details to the Chinese government. Yahoo! was subsequently rebuked by a panel of the U.S. Congress, settled a lawsuit by Shi's family out of court, and pledged to reform its practices.\n\nFollowing Shi's arrest, he won two major international journalism awards: the International Press Freedom Award of the Committee to Protect Journalists, and the World Association of Newspapers' Golden Pen of Freedom Award.\n\nAs of September 5, 2013, Shi Tao was released from the prison. He received an 18-month reduction in sentencing. He had spent 8 years and 6 months in the prison. He is now living in Yinchuan, Ningxia with his mother. \n\nShi Tao was born in Yanchi County, Wuzhong, Ningxia in China in 1968. According to Liu Xiaobo, Shi became active in the democracy movement in 1989 around the time of the Tiananmen Square protests. In July 1991, he received a degree from Shanghai's East China Normal University. He married the following year.\n\nPrior to his arrest, Shi was an editor at \"Dangdai Shang Bao\" (\"Contemporary Trade News\"), a newspaper in Changsha, in Hunan Province.\n\nOn April 20, 2004, Shi received a document from Communist Party authorities which instructed journalists not to report on the upcoming fifteenth anniversary of the \"June 4th event\", the Tiananmen Square massacre. The document warned of infiltration and sabotage by foreigners and Falun Gong, and stated that media members must \"correctly direct public opinion\" and to \"never release any opinions that are inconsistent with central policies\". Shi used an Yahoo! Mail account to send an anonymous post to Chinese-language website based in New York that described the communication. \n\nAt the request of the Chinese government, Yahoo! provided records confirming that Shi's account had sent the e-mail. Shi was unofficially detained on 24 November 2004, and on December 14, he was officially arrested under state security laws on a charge of revealing state secrets. During Shi's trial, his lawyer contended that his punishment should be light as the disclosure of the information had not caused great harm to China. In June, he was sentenced to ten years' imprisonment. \n\nShi's appeal to the Hunan Province High People's Court was rejected without a hearing. Shi's mother Gao Qinsheng filed a request for a review of the appeal on his behalf in August 2005. The appeal was unsuccessful, and Shi was meanwhile sent to Chishan Prison and assigned to forced labor. He began to suffer from respiratory problems, and in April 2006, also developed an ulcer and heart problems. In June 2007, he was given a medical transfer to Deshan Prison, where he worked in the machinery plant, and his health reportedly improved. According to Amnesty International, Shi's mother, brother and uncle were also harassed following his arrest, and his wife was repeatedly interrogated and pressured to divorce him, which she eventually did.\n\nShi's imprisonment was protested by several international NGOs. Amnesty International designated him a prisoner of conscience and called for his immediate release. The Congressional-Executive Commission on China describes him as a political prisoner. Reporters Without Borders launched a petition calling for his release, while the Committee to Protect Journalists described itself as \"outraged\" by the arrest. Human Rights Watch called him an imprisoned \"human rights defender\" and campaigned for his release.\n\nThe incident sparked a controversy about the business practices of Yahoo!, the Hong Kong arm of which provided technical information connecting the message and email account with Shi Tao's computer. Yahoo! was criticized by Reporters Without Borders for acting as a \"police informant\". Yahoo! was first called to testify about the incident to the House Foreign Affairs Committee of the United States Congress in 2006. \n\nIn August 2007, Congress began an investigation into Yahoo!'s handling of the case, with Yahoo! co-founder Jerry Yang testifying in another hearing before Congress. The congressional panel found that Yahoo!'s 2006 testimony, in which a Yahoo! executive had wrongly claimed the company had been unaware of the reason for China's request for information, had been \"inexcusably negligent behaviour at best, and deliberately deceptive behaviour at worst\". Chairman Tom Lantos told Yang to \"beg the forgiveness\" of Shi's mother, who was attending the hearing, and stated that \"Much of this testimony reveals that while technologically and financially you are giants, morally you are pygmies\". Representative Christopher H. Smith stated that there was a \"parallel\" between Yahoo's actions in the case and businesses that helped Nazi Germany locate Jews during the Holocaust. Yang apologized to Shi's mother and stated that he didn't think any Yahoo! employee \"was trying to do anything wrong\" and that the company was committed to \"protecting and promoting free expression and privacy\". He testified that the company was also collaborating with human rights organizations on an industry code of conduct to protect human rights. Yang later met with Shi's family.\n\nAlso in 2007, the World Organization for Human Rights filed a lawsuit in San Francisco against Yahoo! for allegedly providing information (emails and IP addresses) to the Chinese government that caused the arrests of journalists Shi Tao and Wang Xiaoning. After unsuccessfully seeking to have the suit dismissed, Yahoo! settled out of court for an undisclosed sum.\n\nPrior to a trip by U.S. Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice to China in February 2008, Yang appealed to her to \"actively pursue the release of Shi Tao, Wang Xiaoning and other Chinese dissidents who have been imprisoned for exercising internationally recognized rights of expression\".\n\nOn October 18, 2005, the Committee to Protect Journalists announced that Shi was one of four winners of the 2005 CPJ International Press Freedom Awards. The Committee's website stated that he would be officially presented with the award when he is released from prison.\n\nIn March 2006, he was given the Vasyl Stus Award, named for the Ukrainian dissident and awarded for \"talent and courage\". On November 28, 2006, he was named the winner of the Golden Pen of Freedom Award of the World Association of Newspapers. The award was accepted on his behalf by his mother. In 2009, Human Rights Watch awarded Shi a Hellman/Hammett grant, which recognizes \"commitment to free expression\" and \"courage in the face of political persecution\".\n\n"}

The Sinn Féin Funds Act 1947, which attempted to halt the court case and assign the funds to Bord Cistí Sinn Féin, was ruled unconstitutional by the Supreme Court in an important judgement on separation of powers and private property rights. The original action was subsequently decided against Sinn Féin, on the basis that the pre-1923 party was separate from the 1940s party. Most of the disputed funds were consumed by legal costs.\n\nSinn Féin was established in 1905 as an Irish nationalist political party. In 1917, it was reconstituted under leader Éamon de Valera with a more radical separatist agenda, incorporating members and ideas from the Irish Volunteers who had organised the 1916 Easter Rising. It set about raising funds for its campaign of civil disobedience, which by 1919 escalated into the Anglo-Irish War when Sinn Féin proclaimed an Irish Republic independent of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland. Sinn Féin funds were for party-political purposes and were smaller than and separate from the Dáil funds, which the Republic treated as government bonds to fund its administration and its army, the IRA. The party's Central Fund was held in bank accounts controlled by its honorary treasurers, Eamonn Duggan and Jennie Wyse Power. The war ended with a truce in July 1921, followed by the Anglo-Irish Treaty in December, which provided for an Irish Free State. Sinn Féin split over the terms of the treaty, leading to the Irish Civil War of 1922–23, won by the supporters of the Free State over those who sought to maintain the Irish Republic.\n\nOn either 9 December 1921 or 17 January 1922, the Sinn Féin standing committee resolved to make de Valera the party's sole trustee. At the February 1922 Ard Fheis, the officer board became the standing committee. The party was in abeyance from the general election in June 1922, when it rubber-stamped the nomination of a combined slate of pro- and anti-treaty candidates in a failed attempt to stop the descent into civil war. In October 1922, after the Civil War had started, de Valera, who was anti-Treaty, wrote asking Duggan and Wyse Power, who were pro-Treaty, to transfer the funds to him in conformance to the old standing committee's resolution. They refused to comply unless the new officer board/standing committee ordered them to do so. The officer board/standing committee met on 26 October 1922; pro-Treaty members had an eight–five majority and the board voted not to allow further expenditure without its approval. It never met again.\n\nAfter the 1923 ceasefire, supporters of the Free State Executive Council founded the Cumann na nGaedheal party and anti-Treaty activists reconstituted Sinn Féin. In February 1924 Duggan and Wyse Power lodged the balance of the Central Fund in a trust in the High Court under the provisions of the Trustee Act, 1893; the balance was £8,663 12s. 2d., from which administrative costs were deducted.\n\nThe Sinn Féin party lost support when Fianna Fáil was founded in 1926 by its most prominent members, including de Valera; it stopped contesting elections after September 1927. In 1938 it ceded symbolic control of the notionally still-extant Irish Republic to the IRA Army Council.\n\nWhen Eamonn Duggan died in 1936, Jennie Wyse Power became sole trustee of the Sinn Féin funds. Wyse Power died in 1941, and her son, Charles Stewart Power, a judge, inherited the position of trustee. He suggested to Éamon de Valera, then Taoiseach, that the money could be used to support needy veterans of the revolutionary period. While de Valera began planning enabling legislation to effect this, Power approached surviving members of the pre-Treaty standing committee of Sinn Féin for their consent, and all but one agreed.\n\nThe leaders of the contemporary Sinn Féin became aware of the proposals, and on 19 January 1942, brought a High Court action by originating plenary summons against Power and the Attorney General seeking a declaration that the funds were the property of the party, and the payment of the funds to its honorary treasurers. By this time the funds amounted to £18,200 19s. 6d., invested in Irish Free State 4% Conversion Loan, 1950–70 (£13,041 1s. 5d.), Irish Free State Second National Loan (£4,927 14s. 8d.), and cash (£616 3s. 9d.).\n\nThe proceedings were formally called \"Margaret Buckley, Séamus Mitchell, Séamus O'Neill, Padraig Power, Mairéad McElroy, Séamus Russell, Diarmuid Ó Laoghaire, Seán Poole, Joseph H. Fowler and Seán Ua Ceallaigh, on behalf of themselves and all other Members of the Sinn Féin Organisation established in the year, 1905, and reconstituted in the year, 1917 Plaintiffs v. The Attorney General of Éire and Charles Stewart Power Defendants\".\n\nThere was no further action from the plaintiffs for several years and the respondents applied to have the case dismissed. On 21 November 1945 the High Court gave Sinn Féin a month to proceed and notice of trial was issued on 19 December 1945. In October 1946 the hearing was fixed for 26 November. On 11 November, the plaintiffs sought an order that their original solicitor release to their new solicitor papers which he was holding in lien for unpaid fees; the High Court refused and the case was adjourned pending an appeal of this decision to the Supreme Court.\n\nThe Sinn Féin Funds Act 1947 was an act of the Oireachtas introduced in the 12th Dáil by the Taoiseach, Éamon de Valera, on 11 March 1947. His justification was that \"unless there is action taken by the Legislature, these funds will be frittered away in legal costs\". The Act provided for a seven-person board, Bord Cistí Sinn Féin, with a chairman nominated by the Chief Justice and the others by the Government. De Valera had first confirmed that the Chief Justice, Conor Maguire, was willing to make the nomination. The act directed the High Court to pay the Sinn Féin funds to the board; it could also accept donations from others. The board could invest its funds in the same manner as Post Office savings, and could make payments to needy veterans of Irish republican paramilitary groups in 1916–21. It would be dissolved when its funds were exhausted. Section 10 of the act purported to stay the proceedings started in 1942, and to require the High Court to dismiss the action upon an ex-parte application from the Attorney General.\n\nThe act was signed into law on 27 May 1947. On 10 June 1947, Aindrias Ó Caoimh, junior counsel for the Attorney General, made an ex-parte application under Section 10 of the act to dismiss the case. George Gavan Duffy, the President of the High Court, rejected the application on the basis that Section 10 of the act violated the Constitution of Ireland, on two grounds: it violated the separation of powers, in that the legislature was attempting to prevent the judiciary hearing a case as provided under Articles 34 to 37 of the Constitution; and it violated Article 43's protection of private property, by requisitioning the funds without sufficient cause. On 23 June, the Attorney General's appeal was heard in the Supreme Court, before justices James Murnaghan, James Geoghegan, John O'Byrne, William Black and Martin Maguire, with senior counsel John A. Costello and Seán MacBride appearing for Sinn Féin. Conor Maguire recused himself because of his prior involvement in the legislative process. The Supreme Court's judgment, delivered by O'Byrne on 31 July 1947, upheld both grounds of the High Court ruling.\n\nAfter the Sinn Féin Funds Act had been found unconstitutional, the original 1942 case recommenced. It was adjourned after the February 1948 general election to allow Sinn Féin to appoint new counsel, because Costello and MacBride were now ministers in the new coalition government. It was heard in the High Court between 18 March 1948 and 19 November 1948, with de Valera giving evidence on 20 April on Sinn Féin's structure while he was its leader. The ruling, by T. C. Kingsmill Moore on 26 October 1948, was against Sinn Féin, on the basis that the organisation as reconstituted in 1923 was \"not in any legal sense a continuation\" of the party that had \"melted away\" in 1922, to which the funds had belonged. An ardfheis held on 16 October 1923 to revive Sinn Féin was, Kingsmill Moore said, \"not properly constituted according to the Rules [existing prior to 1922] and its actions and resolutions can have no validity in preserving the continuity of the organisation\". The funds remained in the High Court while legal costs were paid from them. By 22 February 1950 the value of the funds was £19,791 5s. 10d. and legal costs of £5,333 6s. 8d had already been paid. A Dáil question on 19 April 1951 revealed that the value was £1,704 8s. 1d., with TDs decrying the amount paid to lawyers. \"The Irish Times\" reported in 1959 that the account balance was still lying unclaimed.\n\n\n\n"}

In response, Roosevelt in his annual address to Congress in 1905 called for the prohibition of such contributions:\n\nRoosevelt repeated his call in the report to Congress for 1906, saying \"I again recommend a law prohibiting all corporations from contributing to the campaign expenses of any party. Such a bill has already passed one House of Congress. Let individuals contribute as they desire; but let us prohibit in effective fashion all corporations from making contributions for any political purpose, directly or indirectly.\"\n\nIn response to Roosevelt's call, Senator Benjamin Tillman of South Carolina sponsored the bill that became known as the Tillman Act. The bill passed the Senate on June 9, 1906. On June 17, 1906, \"The New York Times\" reported that \"One 'great financial authority who is a Republican' gave assurance that 'he and all the financial men with whom I have talked have welcomed this legislation with very much the same emotions with which a serf would hail his liberation from a tyrannous autocrat'.\" The article further stated that if the bill passes the House, \"it will not bring about the millennium, but will lessen a very mean and sordid practice of blackmail... the great number of corporations that have suffered extortion through weakness and cowardice will have their backbones stiffened, and parties will be put to it to fill their coffers by really voluntary contributions.\"\n\nThe Senate bill was subsequently amended to add a minimum fine provision and the possibility of a prison term for officers and directors. It was signed into law by President Roosevelt on January 26, 1907. The Act provided in full as follows:\n\nThe language of the Act provided for penalties but no actual enforcement method; no Federal Election Committee or similar body yet existed to enforce the provisions. There were no existing disclosure requirements for candidates accepting contributions, and so there was no effective way to enforce the new law. The Act applied to general elections, but not primary elections. In the South, the grip of the Democratic Party was absolute, and so the primary election was the most important contested race. Further, a corporation could circumvent the law by directing its officers or directors to make personal contributions to a candidate, which were not prohibited, and then simply give them bonuses at year end to effectively reimburse them for those contributions. The Tillman Act was therefore simply a first step towards regulation of campaign finance. Additional steps would be taken by Congress in the disclosure provisions of the Publicity Act of 1910 (also known as the Federal Corrupt Practices Act), and the extension of the Tillman Act to primary elections in the 1911 amendments to the Tillman and Publicity Acts.\n\n\n"}

The project was funded by Polish businessman Aleksander Gudzowaty to promote peace and tolerance in the Israeli–Palestinian conflict. \nEtched on a stone at the entrance to the park are the following words: \"The monument is in the form of two halves of a broken column, which stand divided but still linked, on the ruins of a nameless and ageless temple. An olive tree grows in the middle of the split column and with its leaves seeks to encompass and shade both halves. The tree enables the two parts of the column to link together in symbolic coexistence.

In June 2015 begins the W15 Tour, aiming to celebrate its 15 years of career and bringing in the repertoire its greater successes.\n\nAt the beginning of 2016 she began recording her eighth studio album, which had begun work in 2015, announcing her departure from the electronic scene for a more commercial pop radio direction for the radio, focusing on Portuguese-language lyrics. Mister Jam and César Lemos were announced as producers and the singer quoted her 2005 album \"W\" as well as the tracks \"Amor, Amor\" and \"Sem Querer\" as references of the material she was preparing. On January 31 it reveals that it would return to use the surname Camargo after 8 years of removing it of the artistic title. On May 17 she announced that she had crated the material she was recording until then and switched the producer team to make a redirection in her career, leaving pop music to focus on sertanejo music now. At the time she entered the studio to record her eighth album again, this time under the new genre chosen, bringing Eduardo Pepato as producer, the same as the work of Luan Santana and Thaeme & Thiago.\n\nAccording to Wanessa, the decision to change the musical genre was based on the personal identification of the country music: \"The way of pop I do not identify myself, it is not my beach, my footprint is romanticism and the sertanejo is a strong mark of my I'm doing what I believe.\" In the same week she breaks with Sony Music and signs with Work Show, producer responsible for releases of the sertanejo market. On July 26, she released the first single from the album, \"Coração Embriagado\", which reached the nineteenth position on \"Billboard\" Brasil, being the best result of her career until then. \"Vai que Vira Amor\" was released as a promotional single on August 26. On August 19 she released her eighth studio album, titled \"33\". The work received harsh criticism, with the singer being called \"Selling out\" and \"without musical identity\" by the musical critics.\n\nWanessa had influences of romantic music during the course of her career, citing Celine Dion, Shania Twain and Mariah Carey as three of her great references. In her early albums, she also sought inspiration from country pop artists, noting Shania as well as Dixie Chicks and Faith Hill - the latter two who reissued the tracks \"Not Ready to Make Nice\" and \"Breathe\", respectively. The singer made a tour in partnership with her father, the \"Pai e Filha Tuor\", in which she sang several of her influences, including \"From This Moment On\" and \"You're Still the One\" by Shania. Rita Lee was another artist cited as important in the professional maturity of the singer, with whom she re-recorded the track \"Coisas da Vida\" for the album \"Meu Momento\".\n\nIn 2005, with her membership in pop music, Wanessa expanded her references, citing as influences Shakira, Michael Jackson and Madonna - which highlighted in an interview for UOL that her favorite songs were \"Like a Prayer\" and \"La Isla Bonita\".
