The act of \"accessing\" may mean consuming, entering, or using. Permission to access a resource is called \"authorization\".\n\nLocks and login credentials are two analogous mechanisms of access control.\n\nGeographical access control may be enforced by personnel (e.g., border guard, bouncer, ticket checker), or with a device such as a turnstile. There may be fences to avoid circumventing this access control. An alternative of access control in the strict sense (physically controlling access itself) is a system of checking authorized presence, see e.g. Ticket controller (transportation). A variant is exit control, e.g. of a shop (checkout) or a country.\n\nThe term access control refers to the practice of restricting entrance to a property, a building, or a room to authorized persons. Physical access control can be achieved by a human (a guard, bouncer, or receptionist), through mechanical means such as locks and keys, or through technological means such as access control systems like the mantrap. Within these environments, physical key management may also be employed as a means of further managing and monitoring access to mechanically keyed areas or access to certain small assets.\n\nPhysical access control is a matter of who, where, and when. An access control system determines who is allowed to enter or exit, where they are allowed to exit or enter, and when they are allowed to enter or exit. Historically, this was partially accomplished through keys and locks. When a door is locked, only someone with a key can enter through the door, depending on how the lock is configured. Mechanical locks and keys do not allow restriction of the key holder to specific times or dates. Mechanical locks and keys do not provide records of the key used on any specific door, and the keys can be easily copied or transferred to an unauthorized person. When a mechanical key is lost or the key holder is no longer authorized to use the protected area, the locks must be re-keyed.\n\nElectronic access control uses computers to solve the limitations of mechanical locks and keys. A wide range of credentials can be used to replace mechanical keys. The electronic access control system grants access based on the credential presented. When access is granted, the door is unlocked for a predetermined time and the transaction is recorded. When access is refused, the door remains locked and the attempted access is recorded. The system will also monitor the door and alarm if the door is forced open or held open too long after being unlocked.\n\nWhen a credential is presented to a reader, the reader sends the credential’s information, usually a number, to a control panel, a highly reliable processor. The control panel compares the credential's number to an access control list, grants or denies the presented request, and sends a transaction log to a database. When access is denied based on the access control list, the door remains locked. If there is a match between the credential and the access control list, the control panel operates a relay that in turn unlocks the door. The control panel also ignores a door open signal to prevent an alarm. Often the reader provides feedback, such as a flashing red LED for an access denied and a flashing green LED for an access granted.\n\nThe above description illustrates a single factor transaction. Credentials can be passed around, thus subverting the access control list. For example, Alice has access rights to the server room, but Bob does not. Alice either gives Bob her credential, or Bob takes it; he now has access to the server room. To prevent this, two-factor authentication can be used. In a two factor transaction, the presented credential and a second factor are needed for access to be granted; another factor can be a PIN, a second credential, operator intervention, or a biometric input.\n\nThere are three types (factors) of authenticating information:\n\nPasswords are a common means of verifying a user's identity before access is given to information systems. In addition, a fourth factor of authentication is now recognized: someone you know, whereby another person who knows you can provide a human element of authentication in situations where systems have been set up to allow for such scenarios. For example, a user may have their password, but have forgotten their smart card. In such a scenario, if the user is known to designated cohorts, the cohorts may provide their smart card and password, in combination with the extant factor of the user in question, and thus provide two factors for the user with the missing credential, giving three factors overall to allow access.\n\nA credential is a physical/tangible object, a piece of knowledge, or a facet of a person's physical being that enables an individual access to a given physical facility or computer-based information system. Typically, credentials can be something a person knows (such as a number or PIN), something they have (such as an access badge), something they are (such as a biometric feature), or some combination of these items. This is known as multi-factor authentication. The typical credential is an access card or key-fob, and newer software can also turn users' smartphones into access devices.\n\nThere are many card technologies including magnetic stripe, bar code, Wiegand, 125 kHz proximity, 26-bit card-swipe, contact smart cards, and contactless smart cards. Also available are key-fobs, which are more compact than ID cards, and attach to a key ring. Biometric technologies include fingerprint, facial recognition, iris recognition, retinal scan, voice, and hand geometry. The built-in biometric technologies found on newer smartphones can also be used as credentials in conjunction with access software running on mobile devices. In addition to older more traditional card access technologies, newer technologies such as Near field communication (NFC) and Bluetooth low energy also have potential to communicate user credentials to readers for system or building access.\n\nAn access control point can be a door, turnstile, parking gate, elevator, or other physical barrier, where granting access can be electronically controlled. Typically, the access point is a door. An electronic access control door can contain several elements. At its most basic, there is a stand-alone electric lock. The lock is unlocked by an operator with a switch. To automate this, operator intervention is replaced by a reader. The reader could be a keypad where a code is entered, it could be a card reader, or it could be a biometric reader. Readers do not usually make an access decision, but send a card number to an access control panel that verifies the number against an access list. To monitor the door position a magnetic door switch can be used. In concept, the door switch is not unlike those on refrigerators or car doors. Generally only entry is controlled, and exit is uncontrolled. In cases where exit is also controlled, a second reader is used on the opposite side of the door. In cases where exit is not controlled, free exit, a device called a request-to-exit (REX) is used. Request-to-exit devices can be a push-button or a motion detector. When the button is pushed, or the motion detector detects motion at the door, the door alarm is temporarily ignored while the door is opened. Exiting a door without having to electrically unlock the door is called mechanical free egress. This is an important safety feature. In cases where the lock must be electrically unlocked on exit, the request-to-exit device also unlocks the door.\n\nAccess control decisions are made by comparing the credential to an access control list. This look-up can be done by a host or server, by an access control panel, or by a reader. The development of access control systems has seen a steady push of the look-up out from a central host to the edge of the system, or the reader. The predominant topology circa 2009 is hub and spoke with a control panel as the hub, and the readers as the spokes. The look-up and control functions are by the control panel. The spokes communicate through a serial connection; usually RS-485. Some manufactures are pushing the decision making to the edge by placing a controller at the door. The controllers are IP enabled, and connect to a host and database using standard networks\n\nAccess control readers may be classified by the functions they are able to perform:\n\nSome readers may have additional features such as an LCD and function buttons for data collection purposes (i.e. clock-in/clock-out events for attendance reports), camera/speaker/microphone for intercom, and smart card read/write support.\n\nAccess control readers may also be classified by their type of identification technology.\n\n1. Serial controllers. Controllers are connected to a host PC via a serial RS-485 communication line (or via 20mA current loop in some older systems). External RS-232/485 converters or internal RS-485 cards have to be installed, as standard PCs do not have RS-485 communication ports.\n\nAdvantages:\nDisadvantages: \n\n2. Serial main and sub-controllers. All door hardware is connected to sub-controllers (a.k.a. door controllers or door interfaces). Sub-controllers usually do not make access decisions, and instead forward all requests to the main controllers. Main controllers usually support from 16 to 32 sub-controllers.\n\nAdvantages:\nDisadvantages: \n\n3. Serial main controllers & intelligent readers. All door hardware is connected directly to intelligent or semi-intelligent readers. Readers usually do not make access decisions, and forward all requests to the main controller. Only if the connection to the main controller is unavailable, will the readers use their internal database to make access decisions and record events. Semi-intelligent reader that have no database and cannot function without the main controller should be used only in areas that do not require high security. Main controllers usually support from 16 to 64 readers. All advantages and disadvantages are the same as the ones listed in the second paragraph. \n\n4. Serial controllers with terminal servers. In spite of the rapid development and increasing use of computer networks, access control manufacturers remained conservative, and did not rush to introduce network-enabled products. When pressed for solutions with network connectivity, many chose the option requiring less efforts: addition of a terminal server, a device that converts serial data for transmission via LAN or WAN.\n\nAdvantages:\nDisadvantages:\nAll the RS-485-related advantages and disadvantages also apply.\n\n5. Network-enabled main controllers. The topology is nearly the same as described in the second and third paragraphs. The same advantages and disadvantages apply, but the on-board network interface offers a couple of valuable improvements. Transmission of configuration and user data to the main controllers is faster, and may be done in parallel. This makes the system more responsive, and does not interrupt normal operations. No special hardware is required in order to achieve redundant host PC setup: in the case that the primary host PC fails, the secondary host PC may start polling network controllers. The disadvantages introduced by terminal servers (listed in the fourth paragraph) are also eliminated. \n\n6. IP controllers. Controllers are connected to a host PC via Ethernet LAN or WAN.\n\nAdvantages:\nDisadvantages: \n\n7. IP readers. Readers are connected to a host PC via Ethernet LAN or WAN.\n\nAdvantages:\n\nDisadvantages:\nThe advantages and disadvantages of IP controllers apply to the IP readers as well.\n\nThe most common security risk of intrusion through an access control system is by simply following a legitimate user through a door, and this is referred to as tailgating. Often the legitimate user will hold the door for the intruder. This risk can be minimized through security awareness training of the user population, or more active means such as turnstiles. In very high security applications this risk is minimized by using a sally port, sometimes called a security vestibule or mantrap, where operator intervention is required presumably to assure valid identification.\n\nThe second most common risk is from levering a door open. This is relatively difficult on properly secured doors with strikes or high holding force magnetic locks. Fully implemented access control systems include forced door monitoring alarms. These vary in effectiveness, usually failing from high false positive alarms, poor database configuration, or lack of active intrusion monitoring. Most newer access control systems incorporate some type of door prop alarm to inform system administrators of a door left open longer than a specified length of time. \n\nThe third most common security risk is natural disasters. In order to mitigate risk from natural disasters, the structure of the building, down to the quality of the network and computer equipment vital. From an organizational perspective, the leadership will need to adopt and implement an All Hazards Plan, or Incident Response Plan. The highlights of any incident plan determined by the National Incident Management System must include Pre-incident planning, during incident actions, disaster recovery, and after action review.\n\nSimilar to levering is crashing through cheap partition walls. In shared tenant spaces the divisional wall is a vulnerability. A vulnerability along the same lines is the breaking of sidelights.\n\nSpoofing locking hardware is fairly simple and more elegant than levering. A strong magnet can operate the solenoid controlling bolts in electric locking hardware. Motor locks, more prevalent in Europe than in the US, are also susceptible to this attack using a doughnut shaped magnet. It is also possible to manipulate the power to the lock either by removing or adding current, although most Access Control systems incorporate battery back-up systems and the locks are almost always located on the secure side of the door. \n\nAccess cards themselves have proven vulnerable to sophisticated attacks. Enterprising hackers have built portable readers that capture the card number from a user’s proximity card. The hacker simply walks by the user, reads the card, and then presents the number to a reader securing the door. This is possible because card numbers are sent in the clear, no encryption being used. To counter this, dual authentication methods, such as a card plus a PIN should always be used.\n\nMany access control credentials unique serial numbers are programmed in sequential order during manufacturing. Known as a sequential attack, if an intruder has a credential once used in the system they can simply increment or decrement the serial number until they find a credential that is currently authorized in the system. Ordering credentials with random unique serial numbers is recommended to counter this threat.\n\nFinally, most electric locking hardware still have mechanical keys as a fail-over. Mechanical key locks are vulnerable to bumping.\n\nThe need to know principle can be enforced with user access controls and authorization procedures and its objective is to ensure that only authorized individuals gain access to information or systems necessary to undertake their duties.\n\nIn computer security, general access control includes authentication, authorization, and audit. A more narrow definition of access control would cover only access approval, whereby the system makes a decision to grant or reject an access request from an already authenticated subject, based on what the subject is authorized to access. Authentication and access control are often combined into a single operation, so that access is approved based on successful authentication, or based on an anonymous access token. Authentication methods and tokens include passwords, biometric scans, physical keys, electronic keys and devices, hidden paths, social barriers, and monitoring by humans and automated systems.\n\nIn any access-control model, the entities that can perform actions on the system are called \"subjects\", and the entities representing resources to which access may need to be controlled are called \"objects\" (see also Access Control Matrix). Subjects and objects should both be considered as software entities, rather than as human users: any human users can only have an effect on the system via the software entities that they control.\n\nAlthough some systems equate subjects with \"user IDs\", so that all processes started by a user by default have the same authority, this level of control is not fine-grained enough to satisfy the principle of least privilege, and arguably is responsible for the prevalence of malware in such systems (see computer insecurity).\n\nIn some models, for example the object-capability model, any software entity can potentially act as both subject and object.\n\n, access-control models tend to fall into one of two classes: those based on capabilities and those based on access control lists (ACLs).\n\nBoth capability-based and ACL-based models have mechanisms to allow access rights to be granted to all members of a \"group\" of subjects (often the group is itself modeled as a subject).\n\nAccess control systems provide the essential services of \"authorization\", \"identification and authentication\" (\"I&A\"), \"access approval\", and \"accountability\" where:\n\n\nAccess to accounts can be enforced through many types of controls.\n\nIn telecommunication, the term \"access control\" is defined in U.S. Federal Standard 1037C with the following meanings: \n\nThis definition depends on several other technical terms from Federal Standard 1037C.\n\nIn object-oriented programming languages, \"access control\" is a part of the apparatus of achieving encapsulation, one of four fundamentals of object-oriented programming. The goal is to establish a clear separation between interface (visible and accessible parts of the class) and implementation (internal representation and helper methods).\n\nAlso known as data hiding, it ensures exclusive data access to class members (both variables and methods) and protects object integrity by preventing corruption by a client programmer/ client classes. Rule of thumb is to use the more restrictive access level for your data, unless there is a compelling reason to expose it. This also helps to reduce interdependencies between classes - leading to lower coupling and fewer regression bugs.\n\nIn object-oriented programming, \"access control\" is typically implemented using access modifiers in the object or class. Although access modifiers may be syntactically different between languages, they all attempt to achieve the same goal; Define which variables and methods are visible and to whom.\n\nSeveral programming languages (e.g. Java, C++, C#, Ruby) use the same public, protected and private access modifiers. These are the keywords which allow a programmer to establish access levels to classes and class members (both data and methods). Their exact use in each programming language is varied, depending on the language philosophy, but there are more similarities than differences.\n\nNote: in Ruby, private methods always have self as an implicit receiver. Therefore, they can only be used on their current object.\n\nIn some languages there are mechanisms to override access modifies to gain access to the private components of an object. One such example is the friend class in C++.\n\nSpecial public member methods - accessors (aka getters) and mutator methods (often called setters) are used to control changes to class variables in order to prevent unauthorized access and data corruption.\n\nIn public policy, access control to restrict access to systems (\"authorization\") or to track or monitor behavior within systems (\"accountability\") is an implementation feature of using trusted systems for security or social control.\n\n\n\n"}

Founded in February 1993, it was among the earliest parties in the Russian Federation.\n\nThe Agrarian Party of Russia was founded on February 26, 1993, by the head of the Altai Republic, Mikhail Lapshin and Vasily Starodubtsev, governor of the Tula region and former member of the USSR's State Committee on the State of Emergency. During their leadership (1993-2004), the party made an alliance with the Communist Party of the Russian Federation (CPRF) and the Fatherland – All Russia bloc. Until 2008, the ideology of the party was agrarian socialism and collectivism.\n\nFounder Mikhail Lapshin led the party until 2004; its most recent leader was Vladimir Plotnikov. In the State Duma election of December 1993, the Agrarian Party obtained 37 seats in the Duma and won 8% of the popular vote. Between 1994 and 1996, one of its party members, Ivan Rybkin, was the speaker of the Russian Parliament. In the State Duma elections in December 1995, the APR did not make it over the 5% threshold, obtaining only 3.78% of the votes. In the last legislative elections on December 7, 2003, the party won 3.6% of the popular vote and three out of 450 seats in the parliament.\n\nAgrarian Party member Nikolay Kharitonov ran as a presidential candidate from the Communist Party of the Russian Federation in the 2004 Russian Presidential election and won 13.7% of the votes, coming out second to Vladimir Putin.\nIn the 1990s, party deputies were usually allies of the Communist Party in the State Duma and advocated greater government support for the agricultural sector.\n\nThe party won 2.30% of the votes in the 2007 elections, did not break the 7% barrier, and thus, had no seats in the Duma.\n\nThe Agrarian Party supported the candidacy of Dmitry Medvedev in the 2008 presidential election. It later merged with United Russia – a party that currently holds the most seats in the Duma.\n\nThe year 2012 marked an especially notable period for the party as it was officially restored, and the registered leader Olga Bashmachnikova was elected Executive Director of the Agricultural Association on May 18. This led the party to take a new direction, moving away from the ideologies of agrarian socialism and collectivism towards centrism. The party has abandoned the Alliance with the Communist Party of the Russian Federation (CPRF), which was in the union since its foundation. Agrarian party of Russia is currently united with People's Front for Russia and Russian Ecological Party \"The Greens\".\n\nAccording to the results of the elections of 2012, 2013 and 2014, the party failed to win in regional and city parliaments.\n\n"}

The stated objective of the BSS movement, and the aim of the slogan, was to initiate a debate in order to stop immigration by non-Europeans and repatriate non-ethnic Swedes. Inspiration came from the post-WW2 fascist organisation Nysvenska Rörelsen created by Per Engdahl.\n\nFounded as a loosely organised network in 1979 by Leif Zeilon, and formalised as an organisation in 1983, BSS was involved with the populist Progress Party () in 1986.

{"id": "44345", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=44345", "title": "Damnatio memoriae", "text": "Damnatio memoriae\n\nDamnatio memoriae is a modern Latin phrase meaning \"condemnation of memory\", i.e., that a person is to be excluded from official accounts. There are and have been many routes to \"damnatio\", including the destruction of depictions, the removal of names from inscriptions and documents, and even large-scale rewritings of history.\n\nIt was a form of dishonor that could be passed by the Roman Senate on traitors or others who brought discredit to the Roman State. The term can be applied to other instances of official scrubbing; the practice is seen as long ago as the reign of the Egyptian pharaoh Hatshepsut in the fourteenth century BC.\n\nIn Latin, the term \"damnatio memoriae\" was not used by the ancient Romans. The first appearance of the phrase is in a dissertation written in Germany in 1689. The term is used in modern scholarship to cover a wide array of official and unofficial sanctions whereby the physical remnants of a deceased individual were destroyed to differing degrees.\n\n\"Damnatio memoriae\", or oblivion, as a punishment was originally created by the peoples of Ephesus after Herostratus set fire to the Temple of Artemis, one of the Seven Wonders of antiquity. The Romans, who viewed it as a punishment worse than death, adopted this practice. Felons would literally be erased from history for the crimes they had committed.\n\nThe sense of the expression \"damnatio memoriae\" and of the sanction is to cancel every trace of the person from the life of Rome, as if they had never existed, in order to preserve the honour of the city. In a city that stressed social appearance, respectability, and the pride of being a true Roman as a fundamental requirement of the citizen, it was perhaps the most severe punishment.\n\nIn ancient Rome, the practice of \"damnatio memoriae\" was the condemnation of Roman elites and emperors after their deaths. If the senate or a later emperor did not like the acts of an individual, they could have his property seized, his name erased and his statues reworked. Because there is an economic incentive to seize property and rework statues, historians and archaeologists have had difficulty determining when official \"damnatio memoriae\" actually took place, although it seems to have been quite rare.\n\nIt is unknown whether any \"damnatio memoriae\" was totally successful as it would not be noticeable to later historians, since, by definition, it would entail the complete and total erasure of the individual in question from the historical record. It was difficult, however, to implement the practice completely. For instance, the senate wanted to condemn the memory of Caligula, but Claudius prevented this. Nero was declared an enemy of the state by the senate, but then given an enormous funeral honoring him after his death by Vitellius. While statues of some emperors were destroyed or reworked after their death, others were erected. Also, historians often wrote about the deposed emperors. Finally, many coins with the images of the discredited person continued to circulate. A particularly large number exist with Geta's image.\n\nThe practice was applied to Elagabalus after his assassination.\n\nLooking at cases of \"damnatio memoriae\" in modern Irish history, Guy Beiner has argued that iconoclastic vandalism entails subtle expressions of ambiguous remembrance and that, rather than effacing memory, such acts of \"decommemorating\" effectively preserve memory in obscure forms. \n\n"}
{"id": "328157", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=328157", "title": "David Orchard", "text": "David Orchard\n\nDavid Orchard (born June 28, 1950) is a Canadian author and political figure, member of the Liberal Party of Canada, who was the Liberal Party candidate for the Saskatchewan riding of Desnethé—Missinippi—Churchill River in the 2008 federal election.\n\nPreviously, Orchard was a member of the now defunct Progressive Conservative Party of Canada (PC Party), and opposed the party's merger with the Canadian Alliance to form the Conservative Party of Canada. Orchard has never held political office in Canada, but has been involved in leadership conventions and other political activities. He is perhaps best known for his campaign to oppose the Canada–United States Free Trade Agreement. Orchard has become a prominent activist against the Canada-U.S. free trade agreement arguing it would weaken Canada's sovereignty and control of its resources. He also campaigned against the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA), the proposed Free Trade Area of the Americas and the proposed Multilateral Agreement on Investment (MAI).\n\nOrchard is a fourth-generation organic grain farmer, and also the author of the bestselling book \"The Fight for Canada: Four Centuries of Resistance to American Expansionism\". He was also a co-founder of CCAFT (Citizens Concerned About Free Trade) in 1985.\n\nOrchard was born in Saskatoon, Saskatchewan. Educated in Borden, Orchard went on to study arts and science and then law at the University of Saskatchewan in nearby Saskatoon, although he did not graduate. He later studied French at Quebec City's Université Laval. Orchard is the fourth-generation on his family farm on which he has farmed organically for over 30 years.\n\nOrchard sees himself as a \"Red\" or moderate Tory and claims to be ideologically inspired by his political idols former prime ministers John Diefenbaker, Lord Richard Bennett, Sir Robert Borden and Sir John A. Macdonald. He is passionately opposed to Canadian economic integration with the U.S., including the North American Free Trade Agreement, which he says impedes Canada's economic and cultural sovereignty. He has criticized many aspects of the United States foreign policy including wars and invasions of small nations.\n\nOrchard supports government social programs, and is a strong supporter of the environment. Orchard is a devoted monarchist, and opposes a weakening of federal powers in favour of the provinces. He also supported the campaign against the Meech Lake and Charlottetown Accords, calling them \"The mortal weakening of the central government\". He also advocates that 3 to 5% of the Gross Domestic Product go to military spending. He is opposed to gun control. He is a social conservative, and (according to the \"National Post\") opposes same-sex marriage, a charge he has denied.\n\nOrchard describes his own views as being conservative in the \"historical mainstream\" and \"centrist\" of the PC party, and claimed they would appeal to moderate Canadians. Orchard's beliefs are perhaps best likened to that of the traditional, British Tory, which although historically common in Canada, lost much of their relevance since the rise of the so-called neoconservative faction. He has been shunned by many conservatives, who often accuse him of being out of step with modern conservatism and too far to the left. Such claims were common during his bids for PC leader, when he was accused being an opportunist who tried to practise entryism, and take over the Progressive Conservative Party and steer it sharply to the left and away from the conservatism of Brian Mulroney and Margaret Thatcher.\n\nHe has never been elected to the House of Commons of Canada or to any public office. As a Progressive Conservative, he sought election in the federal riding of Prince Albert, Saskatchewan in the 2000 federal election. He placed a distant fourth, although with the highest percentage vote received by a Progressive Conservative candidate in Saskatchewan since 1993. He lost in the 2008 Canadian federal election, placing second in the Saskatchewan riding of Desnethé—Missinippi—Churchill River, as the Liberal candidate.\n\nOrchard ran twice for the PC leadership: in 1998 and in 2003. In his first attempt, he finished a distant second to Joe Clark on the final ballot but attracted a very different group of supporters to the Tory party in doing so. Many of Orchard's supporters were former members of the other political parties in Canada and two of Orchard's most prominent endorsers in the leadership bid were the leaders of the Green parties of British Columbia and Ontario. During the relatively quiet race, Clark referred to Orchard as a \"tourist\" in the Tory party because of his left-leaning economic platform and opposition to the free trade agreements brokered by the Mulroney government. In one debate, opponent Brian Pallister quipped that \"Mr. Orchard is so left-wing, he thinks Svend Robinson is a right-wing maniac.\"\n\nHowever, Orchard did gain respect from PC circles when he chose to stick with the Tories after Clark's victory. Orchard and his political advisor Marjaleena Repo worked hard after his failed leadership bid to rebuild several Saskatchewan PC constituency associations and improve PC membership sales across Canada. Orchard was one of Clark's staunchest defenders during the lead-up to the August 2002 convention that saw Clark resign as Tory leader after the disintegration of the parliamentary PC-Democratic Representative Caucus coalition in May 2002.\n\nRespect for Orchard grew in the Red Tory wing of the PC Party: roughly one-quarter of the party membership supported him during the 2003 PC leadership campaign, including Joe Clark's wife, Maureen McTeer. Orchard ultimately came in third on the third ballot in the 2003 PC convention, behind Nova Scotia Member of Parliament (MP) Peter MacKay and Calgary lawyer Jim Prentice. Orchard decided to support Peter MacKay over Jim Prentice due to the latter's implicit support for a United Alternative (merger of the party with the Canadian Alliance (CA) party). However, Orchard's support, which helped Peter MacKay win the leadership, came at price. MacKay signed a written deal, or \"gentleman's agreement\" to seal support from Orchard's largely loyal delegates on the final ballot.\n\nThe deal promised a review of the Canada–United States Free Trade Agreement, no joint candidates with the Canadian Alliance, and a promise to redouble efforts to rebuild the national status of the Progressive Conservative Party. The agreement also included reexamining the PC Party's policies on government subsidies for national railways and preserving the environment. This agreement was controversial, and some time passed before it was released to the public. Many in the PC Party approved of the deal, including leadership candidate Scott Brison.\n\nAt first MacKay had seemed to be willing to adhere to the deal. In July, MacKay struck up a \"Blue Ribbon PC Policy Review Panel\", chaired by Tory MP Bill Casey, in order to reexamine the party's policies on NAFTA.\n\nHowever, before the Panel could meet, MacKay encouraged talks between high-profile members of the Canadian Alliance and the Progressive Conservatives. In October 2003, the talks culminated in MacKay and Stephen Harper, leader of the Canadian Alliance, signing an agreement in principle to merge the Progressive Conservatives and the Canadian Alliance to form the new Conservative Party of Canada.\n\nOrchard unsuccessfully attempted to prevent the merger. In a high-profile news conference in early November he suggested that the new Conservative Party of Canada was \"an abomination, conceived in deception, born in betrayal.\" He urged PC Party members to vote \"no\" on any referendum and also encouraged \"loyal members\" to express their frustrations with Peter MacKay. Orchard argued that his efforts were not based on self-promotion but rather on preserving Canada's founding party and preventing a takeover of the moderate values and membership of the PCs by the neoconservative values of the Alliance membership.\n\nOrchard opposed the right wing, and in his view slavishly pro-U.S. views of the Canadian Alliance. Orchard argued that before the merger was announced, the Canadian Alliance and its leader, Stephen Harper, were highly unpopular and a moment was fast approaching for the PCs to reemerge as the national alternative to the governing Liberals. Orchard suggested that MacKay's \"traitorous\" actions put the above scenario in jeopardy. Some other notable Tories such as Joe Clark, Flora MacDonald, Brian Peckford and Sinclair Stevens also opposed the merger.\n\nIn a last-ditch attempt to stop the merger, Orchard went to court, seeking an injunction against the merger vote. The case was thrown out of court on the grounds that a merger through a \"national convention\" did not violate the PC Party constitution. The merger was ratified with 96% support by members of the Canadian Alliance in a one-member-one-vote process on December 5. The PC Party opted for a \"virtual convention\" in which delegates were selected in ridings and then attended local provincial urban centres in which they voted for or against the merger.\n\nOrchard described the process as fraudulent and undemocratic, as the convention delegates never actually voted together in any fixed location. The convention produced a result in which 90.5% of the Progressive Conservative Party delegates voted in favour of the merger. However, Orchard and other opponents claimed the result was not representative of the true PC membership, pointing out that new memberships in the party were sold almost up to the day of the vote, many of which were card holders of the larger Canadian Alliance and the PC members were being swamped.\n\nMany analysts have suggested that Orchard's battle to preserve the PC Party may have been vigorous but ultimately pointless. By the time the agreement in principle was formalized in October, the fate of the PC Party may have been practically sealed. Orchard himself had commented as early as September that the party's preparations for a widely expected 2004 federal election were in disarray. Since becoming leader, MacKay and the party's ruling council had done little to facilitate election readiness and preparation which may have been an early signal of MacKay's intentions to not run a full slate of 308 PC candidates in the expected election.\n\nOrchard also faced speculation from some opponents and journalists in regard to his motivations to preserve the Progressive Conservative political name brand. Some critics suggested that he was really attempting to undermine Peter MacKay's merger stance in order to force a resignation and prompt another leadership race, allowing for a \"takeover\" by Orchard and his supporters.\n\nAt first, Orchard refused to join or work with the new party. In February 2004, he was asked to take over the leadership of the struggling Canadian Action Party after the resignation of its leader, Paul Hellyer, but Orchard declined. There were also rumours that Orchard was in discussions over a future Saskatchewan rural riding candidacy for the Saskatchewan Party, and Orchard's name was frequently touted as a possible future leadership contender for the Green Party of Canada.\n\nShortly before the Conservative Party's March 2005 policy convention, Orchard had his membership revoked by the party and was denied access to the event. \"The council decided that it was in the interests of the party that they didn't want him to be a member of the party any longer,\" said Ian Brodie, the executive director of the Conservative Party.\n\nOn January 31, 2006, a Toronto judge ordered the Conservative Party of Canada to pay Orchard $70,000, the funds from his 2003 leadership campaign which he had been owed since then. The CPC had previously insisted on Orchard's signing a pledge not to sue Peter MacKay over issues resulting from the agreement signed at the 2003 PC Leadership Convention in order to settle the affair, which Orchard refused to do.\n\nOrchard continues to write for major newspapers, present lectures in Canada's universities on foreign policy and environmental issues, and continues working in the organic farming business.\n\nOn November 19, 2005, CBC Radio News reported that the Liberals were trying to recruit Orchard as a candidate in the 2006 federal election. According to the report, Orchard would be a Liberal candidate in either Saskatchewan or rural Ontario. Orchard did not run as a Liberal in the 2006 federal election but he announced his support for the Liberals and campaigned for Chris Axworthy in Saskatchewan, Yves Picard and Isa Gros-Louis in Quebec City, and Susan Whelan in Ontario. Orchard also officially became a member of the Liberal Party of Canada during the 2006 election.\n\nAfter the Liberals were defeated, and leader Paul Martin stepped down, there was some media speculation that Orchard would seek the Liberal Party leadership. Instead, on August 17, 2006 Orchard endorsed Stéphane Dion to be the next leader of the federal Liberal Party. At the 2006 leadership convention, Orchard led a group of approximately 150 delegates, including 32 from Saskatchewan, in support of Dion. Those delegates ended up being pivotal in helping Dion pass Gerard Kennedy for third place on the first convention ballot, and eventually win the leadership when Kennedy swung his own support behind Dion after the second ballot.\n\nSubsequently, Orchard declared that he would be seeking the nomination in the Saskatchewan riding of Desnethé—Missinippi—Churchill River as a Liberal candidate in the forthcoming by-election in that riding. Again, however, Orchard's ambitions created political controversy. Orchard's nomination fight was ultimately terminated on January 3, 2008 when Dion announced via a news release that Joan Beatty would be appointed as the candidate for that riding, a decision that was the subject of some controversy.\n\nMétis leader Jim Durocher, an Orchard supporter, wrote a letter to Dion complaining about his decision to appoint a candidate rather than allow for party members to vote in a nomination meeting. He argued that \"the people of this riding resent, and I personally resent mightily, the attitude of certain southerners that they know what's best for our riding.\"\nDurocher, a former Liberal candidate, also told Dion \"If you impose Joan Beatty, the Liberals will lose this riding.\"\n\nNational Liberal campaign co-chair David Smith, however, defended Beatty's appointment by saying that Dion had made getting more women into politics a priority, saying that the party is \"prepared to bite the bullet to demonstrate that our commitment to increasing our number of women candidates - particularly well-qualified ones - is very real.\" The media also reported that Liberal party House Leader and Saskatchewan MP Ralph Goodale, a former finance minister, was opposed to Orchard's candidacy in the by-election.\n\nBeatty lost the ensuing byelection to Conservative candidate Rob Clarke. On August 14, it was reported that Orchard would challenge Beatty for the Liberal nomination in Desnethé—Missinippi—Churchill River for the 2008 federal election. Orchard won the nomination, but placed second in the election, losing to Clarke by 3,148 votes.\n\n"}
{"id": "4827953", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=4827953", "title": "Debt service coverage ratio", "text": "Debt service coverage ratio\n\nThe debt service coverage ratio (DSCR), also known as \"debt coverage ratio\" (DCR), is the ratio of cash available for debt servicing to interest, principal and lease payments. It is a popular benchmark used in the measurement of an entity's (person or corporation) ability to produce enough cash to cover its debt (including lease) payments. The higher this ratio is, the easier it is to obtain a loan. The phrase is also used in commercial banking and may be expressed as a minimum ratio that is acceptable to a lender; it may be a loan condition. Breaching a DSCR covenant can, in some circumstances, be an act of default.\n\nIn corporate finance, DSCR refers to the amount of cash flow available to meet annual interest and principal payments on debt, including sinking fund payments.\n\nIn personal finance, DSCR refers to a ratio used by bank loan officers in determining debt servicing ability.\n\nIn commercial real estate finance, DSCR is the primary measure to determine if a property will be able to sustain its debt based on cash flow. In the late 1990s and early 2000s banks typically required a DSCR of at least 1.2, but more aggressive banks would accept lower ratios, a risky practice that contributed to the Financial crisis of 2007–2010. A DSCR over 1 means that (in theory, as calculated to bank standards and assumptions) the entity generates sufficient cash flow to pay its debt obligations. A DSCR below 1.0 indicates that there is not enough cash flow to cover loan payments. In certain industries where non-recourse project finance is used, a Debt Service Reserve Account is commonly used to ensure that loan repayment can be met even in periods with DSCR<1.0 \n\nIn general, it is calculated by:\n\nwhere:\n\nTo calculate an entity’s debt coverage ratio, you first need to determine the entity’s net operating income. To do this you must take the entity’s total income and deduct any vacancy amounts and all operating expenses. Then take the net operating income and divide it by the property’s annual debt service, which is the total amount of all interest and principal paid on all of the property’s loans throughout the year.\n\nIf a property has a debt coverage ratio of less than one, the income that property generates is not enough to cover the mortgage payments and the property’s operating expenses. A property with a debt coverage ratio of .8 only generates enough income to pay for 80 percent of the yearly debt payments. However, if a property has a debt coverage ratio of more than 1, the property does generate enough revenue to cover annual debt payments. For example, a property with a debt coverage ratio of 1.5 generates enough income to pay all of the annual debt expenses, all of the operating expenses and actually generates fifty percent more income than is required to pay these bills.\n\nA DSCR of less than 1 would mean a negative cash flow. A DSCR of less than 1, say .95, would mean that there is only enough net operating income to cover 95% of annual debt payments. For example, in the context of personal finance, this would mean that the borrower would have to delve into his or her personal funds every month to keep the project afloat. Generally, lenders frown on a negative cash flow, but some allow it if the borrower has strong outside income.\n\nTypically, most commercial banks require the ratio of 1.15–1.35 times (net operating income or NOI / annual debt service) to ensure cash flow sufficient to cover loan payments is available on an ongoing basis.\n\nLet’s say Mr. Jones is looking at an investment property with a net operating income of $36,000 and an annual debt service of $30,000. The debt coverage ratio for this property would be 1.2 and Mr. Jones would know the property generates 20 percent more than is required to pay the annual mortgage payment.\n\nThe Debt Service Ratio is also typically used to evaluate the quality\nof a portfolio of mortgages. For example, on June 19, 2008, a popular\nUS rating agency, Standard & Poors, reported that it lowered its credit\nrating on several classes of pooled commercial mortgage pass-through\ncertificates originally issued by Bank of America. The rating agency\nstated in a press release that it had lowered the credit ratings of\nfour certificates in the Bank of America Commercial Mortgage Inc.\n2005-1 series, stating that the downgrades \"reflect the credit\ndeterioration of the pool\". They further go on to state that this\ndowngrade resulted from the fact that eight specific loans in the\npool have a debt service coverage (DSC) below 1.0x, or below one\ntimes.\n\nThe Debt Service Ratio, or debt service coverage, provides a useful\nindicator of financial strength. Standard & Poors reported that\nthe total pool consisted, as of June 10, 2008, of 135 loans, with\nan aggregate trust balance of $2.052 billion. They indicate that\nthere were, as of that date, eight loans with a DSC of lower than\n1.0x. This means that the net funds coming in from rental of the\ncommercial properties are not covering the mortgage costs. Now,\nsince no one would make a loan like this initially, a financial\nanalyst or informed investor will seek information on what the\nrate of deterioration of the DSC has been. You want to know not\njust what the DSC is at a particular point in time, but also how\nmuch it has changed from when the loan was last evaluated. The\nS&P press release tells us this. It indicates that of the eight\nloans which are \"underwater\", they have an average balance of $10.1\nmillion, and an average decline in DSC of 38% since the loans\nwere issued.\n\nAnd there is still more. Since there are a total of 135 loans in\nthe pool, and only eight of them are underwater, with a DSC of\nless than 1, the obvious question is: what is the total DSC of the\nentire pool of 135 loans? The Standard and Poors press release\nprovides this number, indicating that the weighted average DSC\nfor the entire pool is 1.76x, or 1.76 times. Again, this is just\na snapshot now. The key question that DSC can help you answer,\nis this better or worse, from when all the loans in the pool were\nfirst made? The S&P press release provides this also, explaining\nthat the original weighted average DSC for the entire pool of 135\nloans was 1.66x, or 1.66 times.\n\nIn this way, the DSC (debt service coverage) ratio provides a way to assess the financial quality, and the associated risk level, of this pool of loans, and shows the surprising result that despite some loans experiencing DSC below 1, the overall DSC of the entire pool has improved, from 1.66 times to 1.76 times. This is pretty much what\na good loan portfolio should look like, with DSC improving over\ntime, as the loans are paid down, and a small percentage, in this\ncase 6%, experiencing DSC ratios below one times, suggesting that\nfor these loans, there may be trouble ahead.\n\nAnd of course, just because the DSCR is less than 1 for some loans,\nthis does not necessarily mean they will default.\n\nIncome taxes present a special problem to DSCR calculation and interpretation. While, in concept, DSCR is the ratio of cash flow available for debt service to required debt service, in practice – because interest is a tax-deductible expense and principal is not – there is no one figure that represents an amount of cash generated from operations that is both \"fully available\" for debt service and \"the only cash available\" for debt service.\n\nWhile Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation and Amortization (EBITDA) is an appropriate measure of a company's ability to make interest-only payments (assuming that expected change in working capital is zero), EBIDA (without the \"T\") is a more appropriate indicator of a company's ability to make required principal payments. Ignoring these distinctions can lead to DSCR values that overstate or understate a company's debt service capacity. The Pre-Tax Provision Method provides a single ratio that expresses overall debt service capacity reliably given these challenges.\n\nDebt Service Coverage Ratio as calculated using the Pre-Tax Provision Method answers the following question: How many times greater was the company's EBITDA than its critical EBITDA value, where critical EBITDA is that which just covers its Interest obligations + Principal obligations + Tax Expense \"assuming minimum sufficient income\" + Other necessary expenditures not treated as accounting expenses, like dividends and CAPEX.\n\nThe DSCR calculation under the Pre-Tax Provision Method is EBITDA / (Interest + Pre-tax Provision for Post-Tax Outlays), where Pre-tax Provision for Post-tax Outlays is the amount of pretax cash that must be set aside to meet required post-tax outlays, i.e., CPLTD + Unfinanced CAPEX + Dividends. The provision can be calculated as follows:\n\n\"If\" noncash expenses (depreciation + depletion + amortization) > post-tax outlays, \"then\"\nPretax provision for post-tax outlays = Post-tax outlays\n\nFor example, if a company’s post-tax outlays consist of CPLTD of $90M and $10M in unfinanced CAPEX, and its noncash expenses are $100M,\nthen the company can apply $100M of cash inflow from operations to post-tax outlays without paying taxes on that $100M cash inflow. In this case, the pretax cash that the borrower must set aside for post-tax outlays would simply be $100M.\n\n\"If\" post-tax outlays > noncash expenses, \"then\"\nPretax provision for post-tax outlays = Noncash expenses + (post-tax outlays - noncash expenses) / (1- income tax rate)\n\nFor example, if post-tax outlays consist of CPLTD of $100M and noncash expenses are $50M, then the borrower can apply $50M of cash inflow\nfrom operations directly against $50M of post-tax outlays without paying taxes on that $50M inflow, but the company must set aside $77M\n(assuming a 35% income tax rate) to meet the remaining $50M of post-tax outlays. This company’s pretax provision for post-tax outlays = $50M + $77M = $127M. \n\n"}

Like the deputy mayor in other systems, the popularly elected vice mayor becomes acting mayor in the mayor's absence. As previously noted, in some few cities, this office is elected separately and does not entail the elevation by the council of one of its members to be speaker. In some U.S. cities, the mayor and deputy or vice mayor run together as a ticket similar to how the president and vice president run at the national level.\n\nIn New York City, there are multiple deputy mayors who handle coordination of specific policy areas where the First Deputy Mayor serves as the general deputy mayor for the Mayor of New York City.\n\nIn St. Louis, Missouri, there are multiple deputy mayors who handle coordination of specific policy areas where the deputy Mayors serves as the general deputy's mayors for the Mayor of St. Louis.\n\nIn Israel, according to the Local Authorities (Election and Term of Mayor and Deputy Mayors) Act, 5735-1975, a Mayor is usually elected in \"personal, general, direct, equal and secret elections\", with election by a local council being made only if no candidate runs for mayor, a candidate for mayor in a single-candidate election is rejected (in Israel, unlike in the UK, if only one candidate runs he is not automatically elected, and voters would vote either for that candidate or against him), or both candidates advancing to the runoff received an equal number of votes and the tie remains unbroken after adding the number of first-round votes cast for them with the number of second-round votes cast for them. However, deputy mayors are always elected by the local council, of which one is (or, in certain local authorities two are) the Designated Acting Mayor, elected after nomination by the Mayor.\n\nThe French term \"député-maire\" does not mean \"deputy mayor\", but refers to a mayor who is also a deputy of the National Assembly of France. As of 31 March 2017, a mayor cannot hold both posts (article LO 141-1 of the electoral code). The term for deputy mayor in french is \"Maire adjoint\".\n\nIn Davao City, there is both an elected vice-mayor as a direct constitutionally mandated deputy of the Mayor of Davao City and appointed deputy mayors.

{"id": "35929161", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=35929161", "title": "Edgar F. Gordon", "text": "Edgar F. Gordon\n\nEdgar Fitzgerald Gordon (20 March 1895 – 20 April 1955), born in Trinidad & Tobago, was a physician, parliamentarian, civil-rights activist and labour leader in Bermuda, and is regarded as the \"father of trade unionism\" there: \"he championed the cause of Bermudian workers and fought for equal rights for black Bermudians, thereby laying the groundwork for much of the political and social change that came about after his death\". He was president of the Bermuda Industrial Union (BIU) 1945–55. Gordon has been described as \"perhaps the only black charismatic leader to have emerged in the island's modern political history\", and as \"Bermuda's most dedicated Pan-Africanist\".\n\nIn 2011, Gordon was honoured as a National Hero of Bermuda. Other posthumous honours he has been accorded include the Peace & Social Justice Award 2016 from the Roman Catholic Church of Bermuda.\n\nEdgar Fitzgerald Gordon was born to Olympia Jardin and Frederick Charles Gordon in Port of Spain, Trinidad, where he received his early education at Queen's Royal College (QRC), graduating as one of the school's most brilliant scholars. In 1912 he went to Scotland to study medicine at the University of Edinburgh. There he met and married a fellow medical student, Clara Christian (who had previously studied music in the US at Hampton Institute in Hampton, Virginia, and Oberlin College, Ohio). To the displeasure of her father George James Christian, a Dominican barrister who had settled in the Gold Coast in 1902, she abandoned her medical studies to begin a family with Gordon.\n\nQualifying as a doctor at the age of 23 in 1918, Gordon was for some time a medical practitioner in the small Scottish town of Kingussie. In 1921 he returned to the Caribbean with his wife and young family. He briefly worked in Trinidad, then went on to become chief medical supervisor in Dominica.\n\nIn 1924, Gordon went to Bermuda, where he would set up a busy medical practice on Heathcote Hill in Somerset. According to biographer Ira Philip, Gordon \"was brought to Bermuda by Sandys businessman William Robinson to fill a void caused by the death of black Dr Arnold Packwood. The all white local medical board was embarrassed when Dr Gordon passed what he termed was an impossible examination which he contended was calculated to fail him.\"\n\nGordon began to take up the cause of black nurses and the discrimination they faced in employment in Bermuda, writing a series of letters dating from 1929 to the editor of \"The Royal Gazette\" criticising the refusal of the Bermuda Welfare Society to hire Blacks as district nurses. After decades of lobbying, the first black district nurse to be hired was Leonie Harford in 1963.\n\nAfter standing unsuccessfully for Parliament in 1933 and 1943, Gordon won a seat in St George's in 1946.\n\nOn 22 June 1947, in protest at the fact that his fellow parliamentarians persistently refused to address him by his correct title, and that a Bermuda newspaper, the \"Mid-Ocean News\", prefixed \"Mr.\" to the names of white members of Bermuda's Parliament (second oldest in the world), but called him simply Gordon, he announced that henceforth he was to be known by the African name of Mazumbo, with no prefix. His notice to this effect in \"The Royal Gazette\" read:\nHe gave as explanation: \"The name Gordon, which I inherited, reminds me very painfully that some Scotsman in some other age compelled a grandmother of mine to submit to his desires. In Bermuda I am black and treated as Bermuda treats the black people. So I want to be called by a name that belongs to my race and requires no prefix.\" He was further quoted as saying that he had taken his new name from \"a famous West African chieftain, who had once been received by Queen Victoria\". This was a reference to a 19th-century Trinidadian lawyer called Emmanuel Lazare, popularly known as Mazumbo (or Mzumbo) Lazare, about whom Maureen Warner-Lewis has written: \"although born in the Antilles, Lazare appropriated, or condoned the use of, an overtly African designation. The name was a symbol of his identification with black people and the poor. He was a defender of their rights, joined the Pan-African Association founded in 1901 in England by fellow Trinidadian Henry Sylvester Williams, and became a moving spirit behind democratic political reforms at the turn of the twentieth century.\" This characterisation of Mazumbo Lazare is additional evidence for Gordon's motivation in associating himself with the name.\n\nAs a Member of the Colonial Parliament (MCP), Gordon was a fiery and sometimes controversial orator. After the death in July 1948 of the Speaker of the House of Assembly Sir Reginald Conyers (who in his will left money for the Port Royal School in Hamilton, providing it was \"used for the education of white children\"), Gordon told a public meeting that he had only attended Conyers' funeral to \"make sure he was put in the hole\". According to Hodgson, Gordon's \"dramatic personality, his drive, and his unabashed theatricals had done what no one else either could do, or chose to do. He had alerted the Negro masses, he had given expression to their unvoiced despair and anger, often his words had given shape and form to emotions which they themselves could hardly define.\"\n\nChampioning the rights of black and working-class Bermudians, Gordon was asked to become president of the Bermuda Workers' Association (BWA) in 1944, which fought for trade union rights and was committed to the removal of segregation and the adoption of universal adult suffrage. Membership of the BWA had by then dwindled to 200 but under Gordon's vigorous leadership it increased to 5,000 in 1945. In 1946, he began his campaign to petition for social and constitutional change, and in that year the Legislature passed Bermuda's first Trade Union and Disputes Act, which was designed to curb the fledgling BWA, making it illegal for a union to have a newspaper or operate a business. Gordon took the lead in the subsequent establishment that year of the Bermuda Industrial Union (BIU), and the BWA for the time being continued as its political arm.\n\nDuring an extended visit to England from December 1946 to March 1947, Gordon presented a petition containing over 5,000 signatures to the British Colonial Secretary from the BWA outlining various concerns, including the limited franchise, segregation, and restricted occupational opportunities. Only seven per cent of the population could vote, and (as Meredith Ebbin notes) there were more votes cast than actual voters because a property owner could vote in every parish where he owned land. It was a system that gave \"the monied classes a distinct and definite control over the election results\", Gordon said, pointing out that while the UK and its dependencies had undertaken voting reforms, Bermuda had operated under the same system since 1620.\n\nThe matter was debated in the British Parliament, which while condemning many of the practices highlighted in the petition refused Dr. Gordon's request for a Royal Commission to investigate social, political and economic conditions on the island. The Colonial Secretary subsequently issued a document (Command Paper 7093), sent to the Governor, Admiral Sir Ralph Leatham, strongly recommending positive and progressive changes to the colony's discriminatory laws. A Joint Committee of the Bermuda Legislative Council and House of Assembly was formed to study the matter; however, its report in April 1948 recommended against changing the colony's Jim Crow laws, holding that \"the early adoption of adult franchise would be prejudicial to the best interests of Bermuda\". (It would not be until 1959 that segregation ended, with the BIU playing a key role in the civil disobedience that brought about the change.)\n\nAt the 1948 election Gordon lost his House of Assembly seat – a setback attributable to his preoccupation with a dock workers' dispute that year, which had limited the time he could devote to his Parliamentary duties – but he was re-elected in 1953.\n\nIn November 1953, when the newly crowned Queen Elizabeth II made Bermuda the first (24-hour) stop in her tour of the Commonwealth, Gordon learned that of more than 1,000 guests to be invited to a Government House garden party in her honour only 60 were black, and that not a single black Bermudian had been asked to attend the official state dinner. With the intention of focusing world attention on Bermuda's racially stratified society, Gordon passed this news to the British press and Reuters reported the resultant angry protests from the \"Daily Mirror\" and the \"Daily Herald\". In its editorial the \"Herald\" stated: \"Perhaps others may benefit from this instance of gross ill manners. It is time everyone from Governors downwards grasped the facts about this British Commonwealth. Within its frontiers coloured people outnumber whites by more than eight to one. One of the moral pledges by which it is held together is that the colour bar should be utterly destroyed as speedily as possible...\" As Bernews notes: \"The Queen set foot in Bermuda the day the story broke. She was photographed that same afternoon meeting a broadly smiling, tail-coated Dr. Gordon in St. George’s.\"\n\nKeenly interested in cricket, Gordon believed that Bermuda would benefit by closer contact with the islands of the West Indies, which were then gaining ascendancy in Test cricket. He championed the Bermudian cricketer Alma Hunt, who in 1933 went to Trinidad to take part in the trial games from which would be selected the West Indies team for the Test series in England that summer. Although proving himself both on and off the field, Hunt was not eventually given a place. Gordon pointed out that Hunt's status would have been more assured had there been an official body to deal with finance and represent him, and advocated for a Bermuda Cricket Board of Control, which was eventually formed in 1938. He was instrumental in bringing about the first ever West Indian cricket tour to Bermuda in 1939, which was headed by Trinidadian Ben Sealey.\n\nGordon and his Dominica-born wife Clara, who joined him in Bermuda, had six children: Barbara, Joyce, Evelyn, Marjorie (mother of BBC broadcaster Moira Stuart), Edgar (familiarly called Teddy, and later known as Hakim), and Kenneth (who was born in Bermuda in 1927). Clara would organise cultural gatherings, including musical soirees, at their home.\n\nBy a subsequent relationship Gordon had other children; his last child Pamela F. Gordon, born six months after her father's death, would become Bermuda's youngest and first female premier in March 1997 when she replaced David Saul as leader of the United Bermuda Party until that party was defeated for the first time in a general election, in November 1998. Another daughter is MP Patricia Gordon-Pamplin, who having served in various ministerial positions in the OBA Cabinet was announced as OBA interim leader after the change of government in July 2017.\n\nDr Gordon died in Bermuda at King Edward VII Memorial Hospital, following a heart attack at the age of 60, on 20 April 1955. Two days later thousands of people turned out for his funeral service at St. Theresa's Roman Catholic Cathedral in Hamilton and burial at Calvary Cemetery, Devonshire Parish. According to reports, \"Many of Bermuda's blacks wept at his graveside. That they had a better future was in very large part due to his tireless efforts on their behalf over more than two decades.\"\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "6228116", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=6228116", "title": "Financial deepening", "text": "Financial deepening\n\nFinancial deepening is a term used by economists to refer to increasing provision of financial services. It can refer both a wider choice of services and better access for different socioeconomic groups. Financial deepening can have an effect on both individuals' and societies' economic situations.\n\nThe following are examples of different forms of financial deepening. Provision for the unbanked and underbanked in a society. Development of financial markets. Development of financial institutions and increasing the diversity in financial instruments.\n\nOne of the key features of financial deepening is that it accelerates economic growth through the expansion of access to those who do not have adequate finance themselves. Typically, in an underdeveloped financial system, it is the incumbents who have better access to financial services through relationship banking. Moreover, incumbents also finance their growth through internal resource generation. Thus, in an underdeveloped financial system, growth is constrained to the expansion potential of incumbents. In mature financial systems on the other hand, financial institutions develop appraisal techniques, and information gathering and sharing mechanisms, which then enable banks to even finance those activities or firms that are at the margin, thereby leading to their growth-inducing productive activities in addition to the incumbents. The assumption is that the availability of external finance to budding entrepreneurs and small firms enables new entrepreneurship, while also providing competition to incumbents and consequently encouraging entrepreneurship and productivity. However, research indicates that widely available formal finance can produce informal intermediation, an unintended form of entrepreneurship. Hence, maintaining a sceptical approach when researching the effectiveness of initiatives is advisable.\n\nFinancial deepening can have a macroeconomic effect for a country. Financial deepening generally can increase the ratio of money supply to GDP or some price index. It can have the effect of increasing liquidity. Having access to money can provide more opportunities for investment and growth.\n\nA developed financial system broadens access to funds; conversely, in an underdeveloped financial system, access to funds is limited and people are constrained by the availability of their own funds and have to resort to high cost informal sources such as money lenders. Lower the availability of funds and higher their cost, fewer would be the economic activities that can be financed and hence lower the resulting economic growth.\n\nPromoting well-managed financial deepening in low-income countries (LICs) can enhance resilience and capacity to cope with shocks, improve macroeconomic policy effectiveness, and support solid and durable inclusive growth.\n\nFinancial deepening and macro-stability has been identified as a priority area in the years ahead for the Fund, as reflected in its Financial Surveillance Strategy paper.\n\nManaging Volatility and Supporting Low-income Country Growth Enhancing macro-economic policy effectiveness Shallow financial systems limit fiscal, monetary, and exchange rate policy choices; hamper macroeconomic policy transmission; and impede opportunities for hedging or diversifying risk. This is of particular concern because LICs are vulnerable to external shocks, such as sharp swings in commodity prices and fluctuations in external financing. Limited policy space and instruments to mitigate the ensuing macroeconomic volatility often translate into large growth and welfare costs for these countries.\n\nThe association between economic growth and financial deepening has been a wide-ranging subject of experiential research. The practical evidence suggests that there is a significant positive relationship between financial development and economic growth.\n\nMany economists support the theory that financial development spurs economic growth. Theoretically, financial development creates enabling conditions for growth through either a supply-leading (financial development spurs growth) or a demand-following (growth generates demand for financial products) channel. A large body of empirical research supports the view that development of the financial system contributes to economic growth. Empirical evidence consistently emphasises the nexus between finance and growth, though the issue of direction of causality is more difficult to determine. At the cross-country level, evidence indicates that various measures of financial development (including assets of the financial intermediaries, liquid liabilities of financial institutions, domestic credit to private sector, stock and bond market capitalisation) are robustly and positively related to economic growth. Other studies establish a positive relationship between financial development and growth at the industry level. Some supporters of the view that internal factors determine growth (endogenous growth theory) never the less assign a special role to finance.\n\nFinancial systems in developing countries became inclusive in the twenty first century. However, they are still undiversified and small.\n\nFinancial deepening can play an important role in reducing risk and vulnerability for disadvantaged groups, and increasing the ability of individuals and households to access basic services like health and education. This can have direct impact on poverty reduction. \n\nIn developing countries policy and exogenous influences determine whether financial deepening achieves optimum results.\n\nThe All-India Debt and Investment Survey (AIDIS), 2002 raised concerns about financial inclusion, it may have reduced since 1990. After the green revolution focus has been on financing crop loans connected largely with food grains.\n\nThe Reserve Bank of India views the provision of banking to the poor as a viable business opportunity. It notes that costs and benefit exercises need to be attempted by the banks to make financial inclusion congruent with their business models.\n\n\n"}

It is one of a number of tactics used in climate change denial to legitimize political and public controversy disputing this consensus.\nGlobal warming conspiracy theorists typically allege that, through worldwide acts of professional and criminal misconduct, the science behind global warming has been invented or distorted for ideological or financial reasons, or both.\n\nAs stated by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), the largest contributor to global warming is the increase in atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO) since 1750, particularly from fossil fuel combustion, cement production, and land use changes such as deforestation. The IPCC's Fifth Assessment Report (AR5) states: The evidence for global warming due to human influence has been recognized by the national science academies of all the major industrialized countries. No scientific body of national or international standing maintains a formal opinion dissenting from the summary conclusions of the IPCC.\n\nDespite this scientific consensus on climate change, allegations have been made that scientists and institutions involved in global warming research are part of a global scientific conspiracy or engaged in a manipulative hoax. There have been allegations of malpractice, most notably in the Climatic Research Unit email controversy (\"ClimateGate\"). Eight committees investigated these allegations and published reports, each finding no evidence of fraud or scientific misconduct. The Muir Russell report stated that the scientists' \"rigor and honesty as scientists are not in doubt,\" that the investigators \"did not find any evidence of behavior that might undermine the conclusions of the IPCC assessments,\" but that there had been \"a consistent pattern of failing to display the proper degree of openness.\" The scientific consensus that global warming is occurring as a result of human activity remained unchanged at the end of the investigations.\n\nIn a speech given to the US Senate Committee on the Environment and Public Works on July 28, 2003, entitled \"The Science of Climate Change\", Senator James Inhofe (Republican, for Oklahoma) concluded by asking the following question: \"With all of the hysteria, all of the fear, all of the phony science, could it be that man-made global warming is the greatest hoax ever perpetrated on the American people?\" He further stated, \"some parts of the IPCC process resembled a Soviet-style trial, in which the facts are predetermined, and ideological purity trumps technical and scientific rigor.\" Inhofe has suggested that supporters of the Kyoto Protocol such as Jacques Chirac are aiming at global governance.\n\nCommenting on criticism of the Lavoisier Group by Clive Hamilton, the Cooler Heads Coalition notes that \"Hamilton accuses the Lavoisier Group of painting the UN's global warming negotiations as \"an elaborate conspiracy in which hundreds of climate scientists have twisted their results to support the climate change theory in order to protect their research funding\" and adds, \"Sounds plausible to us.\"\n\nWilliam M. Gray said in 2006 that global warming became a political cause because of the lack of any other enemy following the end of the Cold War. He went on to say that its purpose was to exercise political influence, to try to introduce world government, and to control people, adding, \"I have a demonic view on this.\" The TV documentary \"The Great Global Warming Swindle\" was made by Martin Durkin, who called global warming \"a multi-billion-dollar worldwide industry, created by fanatically anti-industrial environmentalists.\" In the \"Washington Times\" in 2007 he said that his film would change history, and predicted that \"in five years the idea that the greenhouse effect is the main reason behind global warming will be seen as total bunk.\"\n\nClimate change has also been called the \"greatest scam in history\" by John Coleman, who co-founded the Weather Channel. When questioned by the IPCC regarding his claims, he responded \"The polar ice is increasing, not melting away. Polar Bears are increasing in number.\"\n\nIn 2012, Donald Trump claimed that \"The concept of global warming was created by and for the Chinese in order to make U.S. manufacturing non-competitive.\" \n\nIn 2015, The Spectator published an article by Matt Ridley describing the \"climate change agenda\" as a \"conspiracy against the poor.\"\n\nSteve Connor links the terms \"hoax\" and \"conspiracy,\" saying, \"Reading through the technical summary of this draft (IPCC) report, it is clear that no one could go away with the impression that climate change is some conspiratorial hoax by the science establishment, as some would have us believe.\"\n\nThe documentary \"The Great Global Warming Swindle\" received criticism from several experts. George Monbiot described it as \"the same old conspiracy theory that we’ve been hearing from the denial industry for the past ten years\". Similarly, in response to James Delingpole, Monbiot stated that his Spectator article was \"the usual conspiracy theories [...] working to suppress the truth, which presumably now includes virtually the entire scientific community and everyone from Shell to Greenpeace and The Sun to Science.\" Some Australian meteorologists also weighed in, saying that the film made no attempt to offer a \"critical deconstruction of climate science orthodoxies\", but instead used various other means to suggest that climate scientists are guilty of lying or are seriously misguided. Although the film's publicist's asserted that \"global warming is 'the biggest scam of modern times'\", these meteorologists concluded that the film was \"not scientifically sound and presents a flawed and very misleading interpretation of the science\".\n\nFormer UK Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs David Miliband presented a rebuttal of the main points of the film and stated \"There will always be people with conspiracy theories trying to do down the scientific consensus, and that is part of scientific and democratic debate, but the science of climate change looks like fact to me.\"\n\n\"National Geographic\" fact-checked 6 persistent scientific conspiracy theories. Regarding the persistent belief in a global warming hoax they note that the Earth is continuing to warm and the rate of warming is increasing as documented in numerous scientific studies. The rise in global temperature and its rate of increase coincides with the rise of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere due to human activity. Moreover, global warming is causing Arctic sea ice to thaw at historic rates, many species of plants are blooming earlier than expected, and the migration routes of many birds, fish, mammals, and insects are changing.\n\nThere is evidence that some of those alleging such conspiracies are part of well-funded misinformation campaigns designed to manufacture controversy, undermine the scientific consensus on climate change and downplay the projected effects of global warming. Individuals and organisations kept the global warming debate alive long after most scientists had reached their conclusions. These doubts have influenced policymakers in both Canada and the US, and have helped to form government policies.\nGreenpeace presented evidence of the energy industry funding climate change denial in their 'Exxon Secrets' project. An analysis conducted by \"The Carbon Brief\" in 2011 found that 9 out of 10 of the most prolific authors who cast doubt on climate change or speak against it had ties to ExxonMobil. Greenpeace have said that Koch industries invested more than US$50 million in the past 50 years on spreading doubts about climate change. ExxonMobil announced in 2008 that it would cut its funding to many of the groups that \"divert attention\" from the need to find new sources of clean energy, although in 2008 still funded over \"two dozen other organisations who question the science of global warming or attack policies to solve the crisis.\" A survey carried out by the UK Royal Society found that in 2005 ExxonMobil distributed US$2.9 million to 39 groups that \"misrepresented the science of climate change by outright denial of the evidence\".\n\nThe novel \"State of Fear\" by Michael Crichton, published in December 2004, describes a conspiracy by scientists and others to create public panic about global warming. The novel includes 20 pages of footnotes, described by Crichton as providing a factual basis for the non-plotline elements of the story. In a Senate speech on 4 January 2005, Inhofe mistakenly described Crichton as a \"scientist\", and said the book's fictional depiction of environmental organizations primarily \"focused on raising money, principally by scaring potential contributors with bogus scientific claims and predictions of a global apocalypse\" was an example of \"art imitating life.\"\n\nIn a piece headed \"Crichton's conspiracy theory\", Harold Evans described Crichton's theory as being \"in the paranoid political style identified by the renowned historian Richard Hofstadter,\" and went on to suggest that \"if you happen to be in the market for a conspiracy theory today, there's a rather more credible one documented by the pressure group Greenpeace,\" namely the funding by ExxonMobil of groups opposed to the theory of global warming.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "300425", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=300425", "title": "Housing estate", "text": "Housing estate\n\nA housing estate (or sometimes \"housing complex\") is a group of homes and other buildings built together as a single development. The exact form may vary from country to country. Accordingly, a housing estate is usually built by a single contractor, with only a few styles of house or building design, so they tend to be uniform in appearance. In the British Isles, the term is quite broad, and can include anything from high rise government-subsidised housing, right through to more upmarket, developer-led suburban tract housing. \n\nIn major Asian cities such as Singapore, Kuala Lumpur, Hong Kong, Shenzhen, Taiwan and Seoul, an estate may range from detached houses to high density tower blocks with or without commercial facilities; in Europe and America, these may take the form of town housing, or the older-style rows of terraced houses associated with the industrial revolution, detached or semi-detached houses with small plots of land around them forming gardens, and are frequently without commercial facilities.\n\nHousing estates are the usual form of residential design used in new towns, where estates are designed as an autonomous suburb, centred on a small commercial centre. Such estates are usually designed to minimise through-traffic flows, and to provide recreational space in the form of parks and greens.\n\nThe use of the term may have arisen from an area of housing being built on what had been a country estate as towns and cities expanded in and after the 19th century. It was in use by 1901.\nReduction of the phrase to mere \"estate\" is common in the United Kingdom and Ireland (especially when preceded by the specific estate name), but not in the United States.\n\nGiven the security situation and Power shortages in the South Asia 'Gated communities' with Self power generation and modern amenities (24-hour armed security, schools, hospitals, a fire department, retail shopping, restaurants and entertainment centres ) such as Bahria Town and DHA have been developed in all major cities Pakistan. Bahria Town is largest private housing society in Asia. Bahria has been featured by international magazines and news agencies such as GlobalPost, Newsweek, Los Angeles Times and Emirates 24/7, referred to as the prosperous face of Pakistan. Gated communities in Pakistan are targeted towards upper middle class and upper class, and are mostly immune from problems of law enforcement.\n\nIn the United Kingdom and the Republic of Ireland, housing estates have become prevalent since World War II, as a more affluent population demanded larger and more widely spaced houses coupled with the increase of car usage for which terraced streets were unsuitable.\n\nHousing estates were produced by either local corporations or by private developers. The former tended to be a means of producing public housing leading to monotenure estates full of council houses often known as \"council estates\". The latter can refer to higher end tract housing for the middle class and even upper middle class.\n\nIn addition, the problems incurred by the early attempts at high density tower-block housing turned people away from this style of living. The resulting demand for land has seen many towns and cities increase enormously in size for only moderate increases in population. This has been largely at the expense of rural and greenfield land. Recently, there has been some effort to address this problem by banning the development of out-of-town commercial developments, and encouraging the reuse of brownfield or previously developed sites for residential building. Nevertheless, the demand for housing continues to rise, and in the UK at least has precipitated a significant housing crisis.\n\nRenowned housing estates in the capital include the Andover Estate in Holloway, North London, the aforementioned Broadwater Farm estate situated in Tottenham, the Heygate Estate in Walworth, South East London and the Alton Estate in Roehampton, South West London.\n\nIn the UK, some of the post war new towns were constructed \"en masse\" from housing estates rather than as organic growth from a population centre.\n\nIn the former Czechoslovakia (now Czech Republic and Slovakia) during the Communist era a construction of large housing estates (Czech: \"sídliště\", Slovak: \"sídlisko\") was an important part of then urban planning. The government wanted to provide large quantities of affordable housing and to slash costs by employing uniform designs over the whole country. They also sought to foster a \"collectivistic nature\" in the people. Large housing estates of concrete panel buildings (panelák) now dominate the suburbs of Prague, Bratislava and other towns.\nThe largest such suburb in the former Czechoslovakia and central Europe can be found in Petržalka (population about 130,000), a part of the Slovak capital of Bratislava.\n\nDue to dense population and government control of land use, the most common form of residential housing in Hong Kong is the high-rise housing estate, which may be publicly owned, privately owned, or semi-private. Due to the oligopoly of real-estate developers in the territory, and the economies of scale of mass developments, there is the tendency of new private tower block developments with 10 to over 100 towers, ranging from 30-to-70-storeys high.\n\nPublic housing provides affordable homes for those on low incomes, with rents which are heavily subsidised, financed by financial activities such as rents and charges collected from car parks and shops within or near the estates. They may vary in scale, and are usually located in the remote or less accessible parts of the territory, but urban expansion has put some of them in the heart of the urban area. Although some units are destined exclusively for rental, some of the flats within each development are earmarked for sale at prices which are lower than for private developments.\n\nA private housing estate is usually characterised by a cluster of high-rise buildings, often with a shopping centre or market of its own in the case of larger developments. Mei Foo Sun Chuen, built by Mobil, is the earliest (1965) and largest (99 blocks) example of its kind. Since the mid-1990s, private developers have been incorporating leisure facilities which incorporate clubhouse facilities: namely swimming pools, tennis courts, function rooms in their more up-market developments. The most recent examples would also be equipped with cinemas, dance studios, cigar-rooms.\n\nThere is currently some controversy over the \"wall effect\" caused by uniform high-rise developments which adversely impact air circulation. In-fill developments will tend to be done by smaller developers with less capital. These will be smaller in scale, and less prone to the wall effect.\n\nForms of housing estates in the United States include tract housing, apartment complexes, and housing projects.\n\n"}

In 2016, HCLU provided legal counsel and representation in 118 unique cases.\n\nOn 11 January 2017, Szilárd Németh, vice-president of the ruling FIDESZ party named HCLU as one of the three key civil organizations (alongside Transparency International and the Hungarian Helsinki Committee) that need to be restricted in Hungary. On 2 April 2017, the government submitted an amendment intending to oblige civil organisations receiving over HUF 7.2 million (about USD 25 000) annual subsidies from abroad to register. On 12 April 2017, tens of thousands protested against the proposed legislation on Budapest's Heroes Square.\n\nThe HCLU’s main objective is to ensure the protection of fundamental rights and principles in Hungary. Its activities are focusing on fields where infringements are frequent, and victims are in particularly vulnerable positions. HCLU aims to protect the principle of personal liberty, human dignity and privacy. Its declared ambition is that the state would restrict fundamental rights only with especially serious reasons, only to the extent that is considered absolutely necessary and solely based on law, while ensuring required procedural guarantees.\n\nHCLU focuses on: \n\nLegal protection\n\nLegal development\n\nInforming the public\n\nPatients’ Rights Programme\nThe Patients’ Rights Programme deals with patients’ rights guaranteed by the Act on Health Care and with other general patients’ rights issues.

The HCLU’S HIV/AIDS Programme and its supervisor are members of a number of HIV/AIDS-related international organizations.\n\nFreedom of Expression Programme\nThe program aims to protect the right of assembly, the freedom of speech, and the freedom of the press. Currently HCLU is the only organization providing free legal counsel and representation for journalists.\n\nFreedom of Information Programme\nHCLU is the most active advocate of the freedom of information among civil organizations in Hungary. Its trials contribute to the case law practiced by judges and courts. \nData Protection Programme\nThe goal of the Data Protection Programme is to allow the state and the business sector to handle data on citizens only if it is indispensable for their efficient operation, and to guarantee that people can decide what information they share about themselves.\n\nDrug Policy Programme\nThe program provides legal counsel for doctors, social workers and professionals dedicated to needle exchange programmes. The program also monitors all media coverage on the topic. \nRoma Rights Advocacy\nInstitutional discrimination, primarily in the field of the criminal and administrative justice system is in the focus of the Roma Program. The Program's aim is to have a positive impact on the law enforcement and administrative authorities as well as on the judiciary. In addition, it is HCLU’s objective to have a positive effect on the legislation: to reverse the process of criminalization of poverty and thereby that of the Roma people. The Program also strives to take a stand against prejudice and discrimination by shaping opinion through various communication activities.\n\nHCLU Film\nThe HCLU has launched its video advocacy programme called HCLU Film in 2007. It has produced more than 500 films since, mostly in the field of drug policy, but we are making more and more films in other fields of HCLU's work.\n\nProgramme furthering civil society \nThe programme intends to form strategic partnerships enabling HCLU to share its experiences with other (local and regional) civil organizations.\n\nDisability rights programme \nThe disability rights programme focuses on assisting mentally challenged and severely handicapped people.

It was established on July 14, 1932, as a symbol of the peaceful relationship between the two nations. The legend \"Peace Garden State\" was added to vehicle registration plates of North Dakota in 1956, and adopted by the North Dakota Legislative Assembly in 1957 as the official state nickname.\n\nThe park plants over 150,000 flowers each year. Main features of the garden include an floral clock display, and fountains. A chime, and twin concrete towers straddled the border with a peace chapel at their base; the chapel walls were inscribed with notable quotes about peace. However, the concrete towers had been declared unsafe due to irreparable weather-related erosion and were demolished in 2016.\n\nThe Arma Sifton bells are a chime of 14 bells cast by Gillett & Johnston bellfounders. The bells were a gift from Central United Church of Brandon, Manitoba, in 1972. The tower was supplied by North Dakota Veterans and dedicated in 1976. Some building remains of the World Trade Center attacks of September 11, 2001, have been placed in part of the garden.\n\nThe Masonic Auditorium, built in the shape of a Masonic Square and Compasses, was completed in 1981 as centennial project of Grand Lodges of Manitoba and North Dakota and features seating for 2,000 people. The Peace Garden Lodge of Freemasons holds an annual communication on the property. The officers, ritual and program are rotated each year between the Grand Lodges of Manitoba, North Dakota, Minnesota, and Saskatchewan.\n\nThe Peace Garden hosts two youth camps every summer, the International Music Camp and the Legion Athletic Camp. Additionally, it has hosted the International Hamfest, an Amateur Radio meet-up, every year since 1964.\n\nLocated at the garden is the North American Game Warden Museum.\n\nThe park lies near the center of the Turtle Mountain plateau, whose climate, topography, wildlife, and natural vegetation differ considerably from the surrounding prairies.\n\nThe park is located north of Dunseith, North Dakota, at the northern terminus of U.S. Highway 281 in northwestern Rolette County. It is also adjacent to the southeast corner of Turtle Mountain Provincial Park in the Municipality of Boissevain – Morton, south of Boissevain, Manitoba, at the southern terminus of Manitoba Provincial Highway 10.

{"id": "38777061", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=38777061", "title": "Internationalism (politics)", "text": "Internationalism (politics)\n\nInternationalism is a political principle which transcends nationalism and advocates a greater political or economic cooperation among nations and people.\n\nSupporters of this principle are referred to as internationalists, and generally believe that the people of the world should unite across national, political, cultural, racial, or class boundaries to advance their common interests, or that the governments of the world should cooperate because their mutual long-term interests are of greater importance than their short-term disputes.\n\nIn 19th-century UK there was a liberal internationalist strand of political thought epitomized by Richard Cobden and John Bright. Cobden and Bright were against the protectionist Corn Laws and in a speech at Covent Garden on September 28, 1843 Cobden outlined his utopian brand of internationalism:\n\n\"Free Trade! What is it? Why, breaking down the barriers that separate nations; those barriers behind which nestle the feelings of pride, revenge, hatred and jealously, which every now and then burst their bounds and deluge whole countries with blood... \"\n\nCobden believed that Free Trade would pacify the world by interdependence, an idea also expressed by Adam Smith in his The Wealth of Nations and common to many liberals of the time. A belief in the idea of the moral law and an inherent goodness in human nature also inspired their faith in internationalism.\n\nSuch \"liberal\" conceptions of internationalism were harshly criticized by socialists and radicals at the time, who pointed out the links between global economic competition and imperialism, and would identify this competition as being a root cause of world conflict. One of the first international organisations in the world was the International Workingmen's Association, formed in London in 1864 by working class socialist and communist political activists (including Karl Marx). Referred to as the First International, the organization was dedicated to the advancement of working class political interests across national boundaries, and was in direct ideological opposition to strains of liberal internationalism which advocated free trade and capitalism as means of achieving world peace and interdependence.\n\nOther international organizations included the Inter-Parliamentary Union, established in 1889 by Frédéric Passy from France and William Randal Cremer from the United Kingdom, and the League of Nations, which was formed after World War I. The former was envisioned as a permanent forum for political multilateral negotiations, while the latter was an attempt to solve the world's security problems through international arbitration and dialogue.\nJ. A. Hobson, a Gladstonian liberal who became a socialist after the Great War, anticipated in his book \"Imperialism\" (1902) the growth of international courts and congresses which would hopefully settle international disputes between nations in a peaceful way. Sir Norman Angell in his work \"The Great Illusion\" (1910) claimed that the world was united by trade, finance, industry and communications and that therefore nationalism was an anachronism and that war would not profit anyone involved but would only result in destruction.\n\nLord Lothian was an internationalist and an imperialist who in December 1914 looked forward to:\n\"...the voluntary federation of the free civilised nations which will eventually exorcise the spectre of competitive armaments and give lasting peace to mankind.\"\n\nIn September 1915 he thought the British Empire was 'the perfect example of the eventual world Commonwealth'\n\nInternationalism expressed itself in Britain through the endorsement of the League of Nations by such people as Gilbert Murray. The Liberal Party and the Labour Party had prominent internationalist members, like the Labour Prime Minister Ramsay MacDonald who believed that 'our true nationality is mankind'\n\nInternationalism is an important component of socialist political theory, based on the principle that working-class people of all countries must unite across national boundaries and actively oppose nationalism and war in order to overthrow capitalism (see entry on proletarian internationalism). In this sense, the socialist understanding of internationalism is closely related to the concept of international solidarity.\n\nSocialist thinkers such as Karl Marx, Friedrich Engels, and Vladimir Lenin argue that economic class, rather than nationality, race, or culture, is the main force which divides people in society, and that nationalist ideology is a propaganda tool of a society's dominant economic class. From this perspective, it is in the ruling class' interest to promote nationalism in order to hide the inherent class conflicts at play within a given society (such as the exploitation of workers by capitalists for profit). Therefore, socialists see nationalism as a form of ideological control arising from a society's given mode of economic production (see dominant ideology).\n\nSince the 19th century, socialist political organizations and radical trade unions such as the Industrial Workers of the World have promoted internationalist ideologies and sought to organize workers across national boundaries to achieve improvements in the conditions of labor and advance various forms of industrial democracy. The First, Second, Third, and Fourth Internationals were socialist political groupings which sought to advance worker's revolution across the globe and achieve international socialism (see world revolution).\n\nSocialist internationalism is anti-imperialist, and therefore supports the liberation of peoples from all forms of colonialism and foreign domination, and the right of nations to self-determination. Therefore, socialists have often aligned themselves politically with anti-colonial independence movements, and actively opposed the exploitation of one country by another.\n\nSince war is understood in socialist theory to be a general product of the laws of economic competition inherent to capitalism (i.e., competition between capitalists and their respective national governments for natural resources and economic dominance), liberal ideologies which promote international capitalism and \"free trade\", even if they sometimes speak in positive terms of international cooperation, are, from the socialist standpoint, rooted in the very economic forces which drive world conflict. In socialist theory, world peace can only come once economic competition has been ended and class divisions within society have ceased to exist. This idea was expressed in 1848 by Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels in \"The Communist Manifesto\":\n\n\"In proportion as the exploitation of one individual by another will also be put an end to, the exploitation of one nation by another will also be put an end to. In proportion as the antagonism between classes within the nation vanishes, the hostility of one nation to another will come to an end.\"\n\nThe idea was reiterated later by Lenin and advanced as the official policy of the Bolshevik party during World War I:\n\n\"Socialists have always condemned war between nations as barbarous and brutal. But our attitude towards war is fundamentally different from that of the bourgeois pacifists (supporters and advocates of peace) and of the Anarchists. We differ from the former in that we understand the inevitable connection between wars and the class struggle within the country; we understand that war cannot be abolished unless classes are abolished and Socialism is created.\"\n\nThe International Workingmen's Association, or First International, was an organization founded in 1864, composed of various working class radicals and trade unionists who promoted an ideology of internationalist socialism and anti-imperialism. Figures such as Karl Marx and anarchist revolutionary Mikhail Bakunin would play prominent roles in the First International. The \"Inaugural Address of the First International\", written by Marx in October 1864 and distributed as a pamphlet, contained calls for international cooperation between working people, and condemnations of the imperialist policies of national aggression undertaken by the governments of Europe:\n\n\"If the emancipation of the working classes requires their fraternal concurrence, how are they to fulfill that great mission with a foreign policy in pursuit of criminal designs, playing upon national prejudices, and squandering in piratical wars the people’s blood and treasure?\"\n\nBy the mid-1870s, splits within the International over tactical and ideological questions would lead to the organization's demise and pave the way for the formation of the Second International in 1889. One faction, with Marx as the figurehead, argued that workers and radicals must work within parliaments in order to win political supremacy and create a worker's government. The other major faction were the anarchists, led by Bakunin, who saw all state institutions as inherently oppressive, and thus opposed any parliamentary activity and believed that workers action should be aimed at the total destruction of the state.\n\nThe Socialist International, known as the Second International, was founded in 1889 after the disintegration of the International Workingmen's Association. Unlike the First International, it was a federation of socialist political parties from various countries, including both reformist and revolutionary groupings. The parties of the Second International were the first socialist parties to win mass support among the working class and have representatives elected to parliaments. These parties, such as the German Social-Democratic Labor Party, were the first socialist parties in history to emerge as serious political players on the parliamentary stage, often gaining millions of members.\n\nOstensibly committed to peace and anti-imperialism, the International Socialist Congress held its final meeting in Basel, Switzerland in 1912, in anticipation of the outbreak of World War I. The manifesto adopted at the Congress outlined the Second International's opposition to the war and its commitment to a speedy and peaceful resolution:\n\n\"If a war threatens to break out, it is the duty of the working classes and their parliamentary representatives in the countries involved supported by the coordinating activity of the International Socialist Bureau to exert every effort in order to prevent the outbreak of war by the means they consider most effective, which naturally vary according to the sharpening of the class struggle and the sharpening of the general political situation.\n\nIn case war should break out anyway it is their duty to intervene in favor of its speedy termination and with all their powers to utilize the economic and political crisis created by the war to arouse the people and thereby to hasten the downfall of capitalist class rule.\"\n\nDespite this, when the war began in 1914, the majority of the Socialist parties of the International turned on each other and sided with their respective governments in the war effort, betraying their internationalist values and leading to the dissolution of the Second International. This betrayal led the few anti-war delegates left within the Second International to organize the International Socialist Conference at Zimmerwald, Switzerland in 1915. Known as the Zimmerwald Conference, its purpose was to formulate a platform of opposition to the war. The conference was unable to reach agreement on all points, but ultimately was able to publish the Zimmerwald Manifesto, which was drafted by Leon Trotsky. The most left-wing and stringently internationalist delegates at the conference were organized around Lenin and the Russian Social Democrats, and known as the Zimmerwald Left. They bitterly condemned the war and what they described as the hypocritical \"social-chauvinists\" of the Second International, who so quickly abandoned their internationalist principles and refused to oppose the war. The Zimmerwald Left resolutions urged all socialists who were committed to the internationalist principles of socialism to struggle against the war and commit to international workers' revolution.\n\nThe betrayal of the social-democrats and the organization of the Zimmerwald Left would ultimately set the stage for the emergence of the world's first modern communist parties and the formation of the Third International in 1919.\n\nThe Communist International, also known as the Comintern or the Third International, was formed in 1919 in the wake of the Russian Revolution, the end of the first World War, and the dissolution of the Second International. It was an association of communist political parties from throughout the world dedicated to proletarian internationalism and the revolutionary overthrow of the world bourgeoisie. The \"Manifesto of the Communist International\", written by Leon Trotsky, describes the political orientation of the international as \"against imperialist barbarism, against monarchy, against the privileged estates, against the bourgeois state and bourgeois property, against all kinds and forms of class or national oppression\".\n\nThe fourth and last socialist international was founded by Leon Trotsky and his followers in 1938 in opposition to the Third International and the direction taken by the USSR under the leadership of Joseph Stalin. The Fourth International declared itself to be the true ideological successor of the original Comintern under Lenin, carrying on the banner of proletarian internationalism which had been abandoned by Stalin's Comintern. A variety of still active left-wing political organizations claim to be the contemporary successors of Trotsky's original Fourth International.\n\nInternationalism is most commonly expressed as an appreciation for the diverse cultures in the world, and a desire for world peace. People who express this view believe in not only being a citizen of their respective countries, but of being a citizen of the world. Internationalists feel obliged to assist the world through leadership and charity.\n\nInternationalists also advocate the presence of international organizations, such as the United Nations, and often support a stronger form of a world government.\n\nContributors to the current version of internationalism include Albert Einstein, who was a socialist and believed in a world government, and classified the follies of nationalism as \"an infantile sickness\". Conversely, other internationalists such as Christian Lange and Rebecca West saw little conflict between holding nationalist and internationalist positions.\n\nFor both intergovernmental organizations and international non-governmental organizations to emerge, nations and peoples had to be strongly aware that they shared certain interests and objectives across national boundaries and they could best solve their many problems by pooling their resources and effecting transnational cooperation, rather than through individual countries' unilateral efforts. Such a view, such global consciousness, may be termed internationalism, the idea that nations and peoples should cooperate instead of preoccupying themselves with their respective national interests or pursuing uncoordinated approaches to promote them.\n\nInternationalism, in the strict meaning of the word, is still based on the existence of sovereign nations. Its aims are to encourage multilateralism (world leadership not held by any single country) and create some formal and informal interdependence between countries, with some limited supranational powers given to international organisations controlled by those nations via intergovernmental treaties and institutions.\n\nThe ideal of many internationalists, among them world citizens, is to go a step further towards democratic globalization by creating a world government. However, this idea is opposed and/or thwarted by other internationalists, who believe any World Government body would be inherently too powerful to be trusted, or because they dislike the path taken by supranational entities such as the United Nations or the European Union and fear that a world government inclined towards fascism would emerge from the former. These internationalists are more likely to support a loose world federation in which most power resides with the national governments.\n\nIn Jacques Derrida’s 1993 work, \"Specters of Marx: The State of the Debt, the Work of Mourning and the New International\", he uses Shakespeare’s \"Hamlet\" to frame a discussion of the history of the International, ultimately proposing his own vision for a “New International” that is less reliant on large-scale international organizations. As he puts it, the New International should be “without status ... without coordination, without party, without country, without national community, without co-citizenship, without common belonging to a class.”\n\nThrough Derrida’s use of \"Hamlet\", he shows the influence that Shakespeare had on Marx and Engel’s work on internationalism. In his essay, “Big Leagues: Specters of Milton and Republican International Justice between Shakespeare and Marx,” Christopher N. Warren makes the case that English poet John Milton also had a substantial influence on Marx and Engel’s work. \"Paradise Lost\", in particular, shows “the possibility of political actions oriented toward international justice founded outside the aristocratic order.” Marx and Engels, Warren claims, understood the empowering potential of Miltonic republican traditions for forging international coalitions—a lesson, perhaps, for “The New International.”\n\n\n\n\n"}

The amendment failed to pass with only 43% of voters supporting it.\n\nThe referendum took place amidst a broader English-only movement in the United States. Most of the funding for the initiative came from the Virginia-based lobbying organization, ProEnglish.\n\nThe text of the proposal read as follows:\n\nEnglish is the official language of the Metropolitan Government of Nashville and Davidson County, Tennessee. Official actions which bind or commit the government shall be taken only in the English language, and all official government communications and publications shall be in English. No person shall have a right to government services in any other language. All meetings of the Metro Council, Boards, and Commissions of the Metropolitan Government shall be conducted in English.

Nothing in this measure shall be interpreted to conflict with federal or state law.\n\nAccordingly, there were five components to Proposal 1:\n\n\nPrevious efforts to pass this type of legislation had been met with vigorous opposition from then-Nashville Mayor Bill Purcell, who argued that the passage of an ordinance making English the official language of Nashville would create legal confusion, resulting in countless lawsuits. In his statement vetoing the ordinance in February, 2007, Purcell said: \n\nIf this law takes effect, this city will be engaged in years of lawsuits testing the effect and constitutionality of the ordinance.

ANARMA) is a Spanish non-profit organisation which defends the ownership and recreational use of firearms by law-abiding citizens (and foreign residents) under national legislation. As current legislation is restrictive by nature, most effort is placed on the adaptation of national laws to EU directive, and defending the rights of gun owners by legal means. Since self-defense is not considered as sufficient motive for acquiring a firearm licence (compulsory for all arms and related activities), the principal collectives represented by the association consist of precision and practical shooters, hunters and arms collectors.\n\nThe National Arms Association was founded in 2003, after a proposed bill had threatened to introduce significant modifications to firearms regulations (firearms are governed by special regulations rather than statutory law). Although the initiative gained a fair share of acceptance at its inception, the fact the bill was never brought to a vote as well as internal conflicts, brought about its near dissolution.\n\nThe association’s resurgence took place in 2010, after presentation of a new bill, introducing important modifications to arms regulations, mobilised the principal affected groups. The association's involvement in the process which led to the dismissal of most of these modifications, as well as its leading role in the withdrawal of another bill, this time on ammunition and pyrotechnic materials, helped it gain popularity among its target audience.\n\nAccording to its constitution act, the Spanish Arms Association has two main objectives: representing the interests of its members and defending their rights, on one hand, and raising awareness among citizenship, as well as the institutions, in regard with the varied facets of firearms-related activities.\n\nThe association argues that Spanish authorities disregard their constitutional obligation to boost recreational sport activities, including those related to firearms. Another argument maintains that current legislation, let alone the proposed modifications, fails to meet EU regulations. The association also defends the preservation of national heritage, from made-in-Spain firearms, to related artisan and craftsmen trades such as sword-forging, considered to be nearly extinct.\n\nThe Spanish Arms Association is not associated with any political party or umbrella organisation, mostly because, unlike other organisations of its kind, it wouldn’t operate as a lobby. This is made possible by the fact that firearms manufacturers, in spite of many being members of ANARMA, are normally formally represented by other, professional associations, which protect their commercial interests.

Lopez Torres\n\nN.Y. State Bd. of Elections v. Lopez Torres, 552 U.S. 196 (2008), was a case decided by the United States Supreme Court that involved a constitutional challenge brought against New York State's judicial election law, alleging that it unfairly prevented candidates from obtaining access to the ballot. The Supreme Court rejected this challenge and held that the state's election laws did not infringe upon candidates' First Amendment associational rights. Several concurring justices emphasized, however, that their decision reflected only the constitutionality of the state's election system, and not its wisdom or merit.\n\nIn New York, political party judicial candidates for the Supreme Courts (the state's general jurisdiction trial court) are elected through a three-part scheme that involves a primary election, a nominating convention, and a general election. Independent candidates need only meet general signature requirements to obtain a place on the general ballot.\n\nDuring the primary election, judicial delegates (not candidates) are elected by the parties' rank and file members for each assembly district. The chosen delegates are sent to the judicial convention for the judicial district in which the assembly district is located. (The state is split into twelve judicial districts, each having up to several dozen assembly districts.) The judicial delegates vote for their parties' judicial nominees, whose names are listed on the general ballot.\n\nA person seeking a political party judicial nomination, accordingly, must assemble a delegate (or group of delegates, who run together) for each assembly district in their judicial district. They must collect separate signatures in each assembly district to get supporting delegate(s) onto the primary ballot and, because delegate nominees cannot disclose which candidate they are affiliated with, they must also mount separate voter education campaigns in each assembly district to explain to the voters which delegates are representing which candidate. After being elected, the delegates can theoretically choose any judicial candidate they wish, but the short timeframe between the primary election and the convention (about two weeks), and the overriding influence of the party establishment, mean that delegates typically do not exercise independent judgment in choosing which candidates to support. The process is too onerous for candidates without significant financial resources or the support of their political party's apparatus, reducing opportunity for independent candidates.\n\nMargarita Lopez Torres received the Democratic Party nomination and was elected to the civil court for Kings County in 1992, becoming the first Latina to be elected to the court. She allegedly fell out of favor with local party leaders shortly thereafter for refusing to make patronage hires. She claimed that party leaders later refused to support her candidacy for the Supreme Court in 1997, 2002, and 2003. Lopez Torres, along with similarly situated candidates, their supporters, and the public interest group Common Cause, brought suit in federal court against the state Board of Elections, claiming that the nomination system deprived voters and their candidates of their rights to gain access to the ballot and to associate in their parties' primaries.\n\nThe District Court for the Eastern District of New York and the Second Circuit held in favor of Lopez Torres, finding that the voters and candidates possessed a First Amendment right to a \n'realistic opportunity to participate in [a political party's] nominating process, and to do so free from burdens that are both severe and unnecessary.' New York's electoral law violated that right because of the quantity of signatures and delegate recruits required to obtain a Supreme Court nomination at a judicial convention..., and because of the apparent reality that party leaders can control delegates...\n\nA nearly unanimous court in \"Lopez Torres\" overruled the Second Circuit and upheld the constitutionality of New York's judicial election system. The court explained that although a political party has a First Amendment associational right to choose its candidates, that right is circumscribed when the party is given a role in the state's election process. Parties that are formally involved in the election process, for example, may be required to comply with a primary process and may be prohibited from maintaining racially discriminatory policies (which could become impermissible state action).\n\nBut, the court explained, the political parties' associational rights were not at issue in the case; rather, the \"weapon wielded by these plaintiffs is their \"own\" claimed associational right not only to join, but to have a certain degree of influence in, the party.\" In refusing to acknowledge the existence of such a right, the court explained that nothing in the law prohibited the candidates from attending the convention and lobbying the delegates, and nothing in the law compelled the delegates to vote for their parties' preferred candidates. As the court explained, \nOur cases invalidating ballot-access requirements have focused on the requirements themselves, and not on the manner in which political actors function under those requirements. . . . None of our cases establishes an individual's constitutional right to have a 'fair shot' at winning the party's nomination.\n\nThe court also rejected the plaintiffs' contention that the existence of entrenched \"one-party rule\" rendered the general election uncompetitive. As the Court noted, candidates could obtain a place on the ballot, without party affiliation, via New York's general petition-signature requirements.\n\nJustice Stevens, joined by Justice Souter, wrote a concurring opinion to emphasize that the court's decision dealt with the constitutionality of New York's judicial election system, and not its wisdom. He quoted Justice Thurgood Marshall, saying \"The Constitution does not prohibit legislatures from enacting stupid laws.\"\n\nJustice Kennedy's concurring opinion emphasized that the political party nomination was not the sole method of securing a place on the ballot. As he explained, a person seeking a Supreme Court judgeship could alternatively meet general petition-signature requirements, these being the lesser of either (1) five percent of the number of votes last cast for Governor in the judicial district or (2) either 3,500 or 4,000 signatures (depending on the district). Were this route to the ballot not available, he suggested that the constitutionality of New York's election laws would be in greater doubt. In the second part of his opinion, which was joined by Justice Breyer, Justice Kennedy discussed the important role that elections can play in the selection of judges, but warned that they might also foster abuse and manipulation. He stated: \nIf New York statutes for nominating and electing judges do not produce both the perception and the reality of a system committed to the highest ideals of the law, they ought to be changed and to be changed now. But, as the Court today holds, . . . the present suit does not permit us to invoke the Constitution in order to intervene.\n\n"}

Protestors station outside of or near entrances to clinics, and attempt to convince patients entering not to complete the procedure. Common tactics used by counselors include offering information about alternatives to terminating a pregnancy such as adoption or keeping the baby, community resources, and fetal development information. \n\nThe frequency with which clinics are occupied by sidewalk counselors vary widely among clinics and on a state-by-state basis. Joseph Scheidler, author of Closed: 99 Ways to Stop Abortion and the authority anti-abortion protesting, calls sidewalk counseling “the single most valuable activity that a pro-life person can engage in.” According to Schedler, pro-life counseling “comes between the baby who is scheduled to be killed and the doctor who will do the killing.\" Scheidler recommends that anti-abortion groups should place two or three counselors at each clinic on a regular basis. The presence of those counselors will theoretically act as a deterrent to women arriving their appointment, who will see the protestors and return home, drive to another clinic, or reschedule. Without any patients, the clinics will be forced out of business, which will inherently protect more unborn children. While counselors claim to be peaceful and simply offering help to patients, some academics have referred to these counseling tactics as intimidation, rather than as a form of persuasion.\n\nFollowing the assassination of Dr. David Gunn and the unprecedented number of violent clinic protests and blockades that followed, Congress passed the Freedom of Access to Clinic Entrances (FACE) Act, which was signed into law by President Clinton in May 1994. FACE makes it a federal crime to use force, the threat of force, or physical obstruction to prevent women from seeking, obtaining, or providing reproductive health services.\n\nA few states and municipalities have also enacted legal restrictions against intimidation tactics of anti-abortion protestors. The two main types of legal restrictions are buffer zone laws and bubble zone laws. Buffer zone laws limit how close demonstrators are permitted to get a facility. Bubble zone laws create floating areas around specific people (like clinic staff and their patients), and prohibit protestors from coming within a certain distance of those individuals.\n\nColorado: A 1999 statute passed by the Colorado state legislature creates a 100-foot buffer zone around a clinic and an 8 foot floating bubble zone around any person entering the clinic. The law prohibits any person outside those boundaries from engaging in oral protest, education, or counseling, or passing a leaflet or displaying a sign to another person without their consent. These tactics could be anything from passing a leaflet or displaying a sign to, or engaging in oral protest, education, or counseling with another person without their consent. This statute was the first law placed restrictions on non-violent forms of anti-abortion protest.\n\nMontana: In 2005, the Montana state legislature passed HB 324, which established a 36-foot buffer zone around reproductive health clinics and prevents protestors from coming within eight feet of anyone entering or leaving healthcare facility.\n\nMassachusetts: In 2007, the Massachusetts state legislature passed a bill that would create a 35-foot buffer zone around entrances, exits, and driveways of abortion clinics. The law does not include a floating buffer zone provision. The goal of the legislation was to “prevent interference with patients’ ability to access clinics and to protect them from being lectured, abused, or harassed by anti-choice activists.”\n\nMany of these laws have been challenged on the grounds that they are restrictions on protestors’ First Amendment right to free speech and free assembly.\n\nColorado’s buffer law statute was the first to be challenged in the courts. This first challenge was petitioned by Leila Hill and a group of sidewalk counselors who claimed that the law violated her group’s First Amendment right to free speech. The district judge dismissed the case, citing Ward v. Rock Against Racism in its ruling that the buffer law established that the government could enforce laws that imposed content-neutral time, place, and manner restrictions that were narrowly tailored to serve a significant government interest.\n\nThe case eventually reached the US Supreme Court. In a 6–3 decision, the Court ruled that law’s regulations on speech-related conduct are constitutional. Writing for the majority, Justice John Paul Stevens argued that the statute “is not a regulation of speech. Rather, it is a regulation of the place where some speech may occur.” While the statute prohibits speakers from approaching unwilling listeners, it does not require a speaker to move away from a passerby, or place a restriction on the content of a message. The law simply makes it more difficult to offer unwanted advice to persons entering or leaving medical facilities, and adequately balances the need to protect medical patients from unwanted communication, with the need to leave open sufficient channels of communication for protestors. Writing in dissent, Justice Scalia argued that demonstrators “don’t want to protest abortion. They want to talk to the women who are about to get abortions and try to talk them out of it. I think it distorts it to say that what they want to do is protest abortion.” Since the conversations are consensual and simply attempts to offer guidance, the law is an unconstitutional restriction on the First Amendment.\n\nIn 2007, Eleanor McCullen, a member of Operation Rescue, filed a lawsuit against the Commonwealth of Massachusetts citing that the state’s buffer zone law was a violation of the First Amendment protection of free speech. The federal district court held that while the law placed a restriction on the time, place, and manner of the speech, the law was constitutional “because it was content-neutral and still left adequate, if not perfect, alternative means of communication.” The Court of Appeals affirmed the lower courts ruling, adding that Hill v. Colorado had already affirmed a similar statute in Colorado. On March 25, 2013, McCullen filed a petition for a writ of certiorari with the Supreme Court, and on June 24, 2013 the petition was granted. The case was argued on January 15, 2014.\n\nDuring oral arguments opponents of the law argued that the exemption for employees creates an unconstitutional imbalance in speech. Presenting McCullen as a peaceful counselor who “gently and lovingly” approaches women to convince them not to have abortion and presents patients tiny knitted caps, prosecutors argued that her anti-abortion speech is limited while the clinic of those who support the clinic is not. Alternatively, Jennifer Miller, who argued the case for Massachusetts, claimed that the restrictions on speech are warranted to prevent violence or disruptions outside the clinics. On June 26, 2014 the Supreme Court unanimously ruled that the buffer zone was an unconstitutional infringement on the First Amendment because it blocked peaceful protest on public streets.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "4411276", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=4411276", "title": "Partisan (politics)", "text": "Partisan (politics)\n\nIn U.S. politics, a partisan is a committed member of a political party or political coalitions. In multi-party systems, the term is used for politicians who strongly support their party's policies and are reluctant to compromise with their political opponents.\n\nIn the United States, the meaning of the term has changed dramatically over the last 60 years. Before the American National Election Study (described in Angus Campbell et al., in \"The American Voter\") began in 1952, an individual's partisan tendencies were typically determined from their voting behavior. Since then, \"partisan\" has come to refer to an individual with a psychological identification with one or the other of the major parties.\n\nCandidates, depending on their political beliefs, may choose to join a party. As it has existing Framework for career advancement, parties\nare more often than not the preferred choice for candidates. Wherein there are many parties in a system, candidates often join them as opposed to standing as an Independent, if that is provided for.\n\nIn the U.S, politicians have generally been identified with a party. Many local elections in the U.S. (as for mayor) are \"nonpartisan.\" A candidate may have a party affiliation but it is not listed on the ballot. Independents occasionally appear in major contests but rarely win. At the presidential level the best vote getters were Ross Perot in 1992 and 1996, and John B. Anderson in 1980. In 2016 Bernie Sanders, an independent Senator from Vermont who caucused with the Democratic Party for years, entered the Democratic Party primaries and made a strong second-place finish, and left the party after the 2016 Democratic National Convention.\n\nPresident Dwight D. Eisenhower was nonpartisan until 1952, when he joined the Republican Party and was elected president. More than any modern president he had a nonpartisan image in domestic affairs. According to David A. Crockett, \"Much of Eisenhower's nonpartisan image was genuine, for he found Truman's campaigning distasteful and inappropriate, and he disliked the partisan aspects of campaigning.\" With little interest in routine partisanship, Eisenhower left much of the building and sustaining of the Republican Party to his vice president, Richard Nixon. \"With few formal duties, Nixon threw himself into state and local politics, making hundreds of speeches across the land. With Eisenhower uninvolved in party building, Nixon became the de facto national GOP leader.\" \n\nEisenhower paid close personal attention to foreign and military affairs. However in domestic policy, his avoidance of partisanship meant that he did not interfere with the conservative policies of Senate leader Robert Taft. The Democrats regained control of both houses of Congress of 1954. Eisenhower's largely nonpartisan stance allowed him to work smoothly with the Democratic leaders Speaker Sam Rayburn in the House, and Majority Leader Lyndon Johnson in the Senate. Jean Smith says that: \n\nPartiinost' () is a transliteration of a Russian term from Marxism-Leninism. It can be variously translated as party-mindedness, partisanship, or party spirit. The term can refer to both a philosophical position concerning the sociology of knowledge and an official doctrine of public intellectual life in the Soviet Union.\n\nThe term was coined by Vladimir Lenin in 1895, responding to Peter Struve, to counter what he considered to be the futility of objectivity in political economic analysis.\nClass interests and material conditions of existence determine ideology, and thus, in a Marxist-Leninist view, true objectivity (in terms of non-partisanship) is not possible in a society of antagonistic classes. Marxists, in Lenin's view, should openly acknowledge their partisanship on the side of proletarian revolution. Bourgeois emphasis on the normative goal of objectivity is thus considered to be delusional. In this sense, \"partiinost\"' is a universal and inevitable element of political and ideological life, but its presence is not always acknowledged, or is often flatly denied, by the ruling class.\n\nDescriptively, \"partiinost\"' was not a novel concept, and had been described in different words by Thrasymachus, Xenophanes, and Karl Marx. However, Lenin's term has a normative element that was not present in prior descriptions of the phenomenon. In other words, Lenin insisted that partiinost' \"should\" be publicly expressed whenever possible.\n\nA clear expression of \"partiinost\"' can be found in its entry in the Great Soviet Encyclopedia:\nThe Communist Party consistently upholds the principle of \"partiinost\"'. Defending and substantiating the goals and tasks of the working class and the policies of the Communist Party, Marxist-Leninist theory mercilessly criticizes the exploiters' system, its politics, and its ideology. ... By contrast, the bourgeoisie, whose interests conflict with those of the majority, is forced to hide its self-seeking aspirations, to pretend that its economic and political aims are those of society as a whole, and to wrap itself in the toga of non-partisanship\n\n\"Partiinost\"' is also used by Lenin in Materialism and Empirio-criticism to refer to the concept of philosophical factionalism, which he defined broadly as the struggle between idealists and materialists. The term is also commonly used in modern Russian to describe political affiliations.\n\n\nGraphic showing Rise of Partisanship in the US House of Representatives 1949-2011\n"}
{"id": "1095076", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1095076", "title": "Peace, order, and good government", "text": "Peace, order, and good government\n\nIn many Commonwealth jurisdictions, the phrase \"peace, order, and good government\" is an expression used in law to express the legitimate objects of legislative powers conferred by statute. The phrase appears in many Imperial Acts of Parliament and Letters Patent, most notably the constitutions of Canada, the Commonwealth of Australia and, formerly, New Zealand and South Africa. Contrast with \"life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness\", a spiritually-similar phrase found in the United States Declaration of Independence.\n\nLegal documents often contain a residual clause which expresses which entity will have authority over jurisdictions that have not otherwise been delineated or are in dispute. While specific authorities are often enumerated in legal documents as well, the designation of a residual power helps provide direction to future decision-makers and in emerging issue areas. At its origin, the preferred phrase was \"peace, \"welfare\" and good government,\" but this eventually evolved into \"peace, \"order\" and good government,\" which soon became part of the standard phraseology used in British Colonies to denote the residual power of the government. Although this phrase is used in the constitutional documents of several commonwealth countries, it has taken on a particular importance in the Canadian constitution due to repeated disputes about the natural of residual federal power in Canada.\n\nIn Canada, \"peace, order and good government\" (in French, \"paix, ordre et bon gouvernement\"), often abbreviated POGG, is often used to describe the principles upon which that country's Confederation took place. A similar phrase, \"peace, welfare, and good government\", had been used the Act of Union 1840 that created the Province of Canada. The now familiar phrase \"peace, order and good government\" was originally used in the British North America Act, 1867 (now known as the Constitution Act, 1867) enacted by the Imperial Parliament, and it defines the principles under which the Canadian Parliament should legislate. Specifically, the phrase appears in section 91 of the Act, which is part of the block of sections that divide legislative powers between the federal and provincial levels of government. POGG is a head of power arising from opening words of section 91 and is distinct from the enumerated powers under that section. The broad language suggests that there is a comprehensive grant of residual legislative authority to the federal government. Although the residual nature of the clause remains, the scope of the clause has been limited by the jurisprudence of the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council (JCPC). The JCPC narrowed the scope of the clause to the three distinct branches which remain while also broadly interpreting the scope of provincial authority over property and civil rights under section 92(13) of the Constitution Act, 1867. The jurisprudence has been defined into three branches: Emergency Branch, Gap or Purely Residual Branch, and National Concern Branch.\n\nAlthough the text of the Act gives Parliament residuary powers to enact laws in any area that has not been allocated to the provincial governments, subsequent jurisprudence has limited the scope of the \"peace, order, and good government\" power. The limitation on the scope of this clause stems from the narrow interpretation of its branches and the expansive interpretation of provincial powers under section 92 of the Constitution Act, 1867. Particularly limiting is the breadth of provincial power over property and civil rights under s. 92(13). Although the Emergency Branch and the National Concern Branch may be viewed as delimited federal competencies like the enumerated clauses under section 91 (see e.g. \"AG Canada v AG Ontario (Labour Conventions)\", [1937] AC 326 (PC)), the clause remains residuary. The powers under POGG must be interpreted in light of the subsequent jurisprudence on the limitations of the clause and the expansive powers of the provinces under their enumerated heads of power. If a matter does not fall within one of the enumerated classes in section 92, section 91, or the emergency or national concern branches, then it falls within the narrowly defined residual branch of POGG. The POGG power is best understood as a narrowly defined residual power limited to the following three branches.\n\nPOGG's gap-filling power covers issues such as drafting oversights and matters not within the boundaries of a province. Drafting oversights include things the drafters of the Constitution forgot to think about but would unambiguously have allocated to Parliament if they had. For instance, section 92 allocates responsibility for provincially incorporated companies to the legislatures but section 91 says nothing about federally incorporated companies: the gap branch allocates this jurisdiction to Parliament, per \"John Deere Plow Co v Wharton\", 1915. Matters not within the boundaries of a particular province include Canadian territorial lands and waters that are within provincial boundaries such as the seabed off the coast of Newfoundland, per \"Reference Re Seabed and Subsoil of Continental Shelf Offshore Newfoundland\", [1984] 1 S.C.R. 86.\n\nThe gap branch is rarely relied on because there is so little left to default to the federal government after taking into account the enumerated provincial power over property and civil rights under section 92(13) which applies to any transaction, person or activity that is found within the province. Historically new subject matters, such as aeronautics, do not necessarily fall residually to the federal government, per \"Johannesson v West St Paul (Rural Municipality of)\", 1952.\n\nParliament may invoke emergency powers under the emergency branch of POGG. This began in 1882, when the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council (then the supreme authority over Canadian law) ruled in \"Russell v. The Queen\" that the federal government could legislate with regard to alcohol, because even though this would probably have been considered provincial jurisdiction in ordinary circumstances, the federal government was acting to ensure order in Canada. This concept further evolved during the 1920s, when in the 1922 Board of Commerce case, it was stated that POGG could be invoked in times of war and famine, to allow Parliament to intervene in matters of provincial jurisdiction. POGG was later used this way in the \"Anti-Inflation Reference\" of 1976, when the Supreme Court of Canada allowed Parliament to regulate inflation on the grounds that it posed a considerable economic problem for Canada. In that case, a great degree of deference was exercised in accepting what the federal government deemed to be an emergency.\n\nThe \"national concern\" doctrine (sometimes referred to as \"national dimensions\") was an alternate means of applying the POGG powers that found use in the mid 20th century. It allowed Parliament to legislate on matters that would normally fall to the provincial government when the issue became of such importance that it concerned the entire country. \n\nThe doctrine originated from a statement by Lord Watson in the Local Prohibition case (1896), wherein he stated:\nAfter this case the doctrine was completely ignored until 1946 when Viscount Simons brought it back in the case of \"Ontario v. Canada Temperance Foundation\", [1946] A.C. 193 (P.C.). The test as stated in \"Temperance Foundation\" was whether the matter \"goes beyond local or provincial concern or interests and must from its inherent nature be the concern of the Dominion as a whole\".\n\nThe above branches of the power are currently governed by the principles stated by Le Dain J. in \"R. v. Crown Zellerbach Canada Ltd.\":\n\nDespite its technical purpose, the phrase “peace, order and good government” has also become meaningful to Canadians. This tripartite motto is sometimes said to define Canadian values in a way comparable to “liberté, égalité, fraternité” (liberty, equality, fraternity) in France or “life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness” in the United States. Indeed, peace, order and good government has been used by some scholars to make broad characterisations of Canada's political culture. US sociologist Seymour Martin Lipset, for example, contrasted POGG with the American tripartite motto to conclude Canadians generally believe in a higher degree of deference to the law. As Canadian historian Donald Creighton argued in his report to the Royal Commission on Dominion-Provincial Relations, the expression was used interchangeably in the 19th century by Canadian and Imperial officials with the expression \"peace, welfare and good government\". The term \"welfare\" referred not to its more narrow modern echoes, but to the protection of the common wealth, the general public good. \"Good government\" referred to good public administration, on the one hand, but also had echoes of what we now talk of as good governance, which incorporates the notion of appropriate self-governance by civil society actors, since one element of good government was thought to be its limitation to its appropriate sphere of responsibility.\n\nThe phrase \"peace, order and good government\" appears in many 19th and 20th century British Acts of Parliament, such as the New Zealand Constitution Act 1852, the Colonial Laws Validity Act 1865, the British Settlements Act 1887, the Commonwealth of Australia Constitution Act 1900, the South Africa Act 1909, and the West Indies Act 1962 and the Government of Ireland Act 1920. \n\nIn \"Ibrelebbe v. The Queen\" [1964] AC 900, 923, the words \"peace, order and good government\" contained in the Ceylon Constitution Order-in-Council (1946) were said by the Privy Council to \n\nHowever, those powers are not unlimited. In \"The Trustees Executors and Agency Co. Ltd v. Federal Commissioner of Taxation\" (1933) 49 CLR 220, Justice Evatt of the High Court of Australia wrote a separate judgement analyzing the power to make laws for the \"peace, order and good government of New Zealand\" under the New Zealand Constitution. His Honour held that laws dealing only with circumstances, persons or things outside of New Zealand, while not \"prima facie\" invalid could, in some cases, fail to satisfy the description of being for the peace, order and good government \"of New Zealand\". A law that failed to satisfy that description would be beyond legislative power and invalid, but Evatt J noted that cases of this kind would be \"very rare\". \n\nRecently, in \"R. v. Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs, ex parte Bancoult\" [2000] EWHC 413, the High Court of England and Wales struck down an ordinance made in 1971 by the Commissioner of the British Indian Ocean Territory expelling the entire population of the Chagos Archipelago to make way for an American military base at Diego Garcia, purportedly under his power to legislate for the \"peace, order and good government\" of the territory. Lord Justice Laws, ordering the British Government to allow the inhabitants to return to their former homes, condemned the depopulation of the islands in the name of \"peace, order and good government\" with the words:\n\n\n\n"}

It was established in 1971 according to amendments to the 1963 Constitution and reorganized by the 1974 Constitution. Up to 1974, the Presidency had 23 members – three from each republic, two from each autonomous province and President Josip Broz Tito. In 1974 the Presidency was reduced to 9 members – one from each republic and autonomous province and, until 1988, President of the League of Communists of Yugoslavia \"ex officio\".\n\nAccording to the 1974 Constitution, the Presidency had following powers:\n\nThe Presidency had eight members elected by parliaments of each republic and autonomous province and proclaimed by the Federal Assembly of the SFRY, the ninth member was president of the Presidium of the League of Communists of Yugoslavia. This ex officio membership of the LCY leader was abolished by the constitutional changes in autumn 1988. The mandate of the Presidency lasted five years so the nine-member Presidency was elected in total four times - in 1974, 1979, 1984 and 1989.\n\nUntil 1980 most of powers of the Presidency (and control over the country in general) were in fact exercised by Josip Broz Tito, who was president of the republic for life. After his death in May 1980, his office stayed vacant and the Presidency began to function according to the constitution.\n\nSometimes, the Presidency held its sessions in an extended composition. Besides the members of the actual Presidency, in such sessions took part following officials: chairman of the Federal Assembly, chairman and vice-chairman of the Federal Executive Council (the government), federal secretaries (ministers) of defense, interior and foreign affairs, chairman of the Federal Conference of the Socialist Alliance of Working People of Yugoslavia and chairmen of the Presidencies of the Yugoslav republics and autonomous provinces. The extended Presidency wasn't grounded in the Constitution and couldn't itself adopt any decisions.\n\nTito, as a president of the republic, was ex officio chairman of the Presidency. After his death a new chairman of the Presidency was elected every year. The order of rotating of the members on the leading position was agreed in advance, so this annual election was a pure formality. The rotating system jammed only in May 1991 - Stipe Mesić, representative of Franjo Tuđman's new Croatian government in the Presidency, was about to become the chairman but wasn't elected due to opposition of a half of the Presidency controlled by Serbian leader Slobodan Milošević. The top state office of the disintegrating federation remained vacant until 1 July when Mesić was finally elected.\nOnly one year after Tito's death, Yugoslav leaders had to face violent riots in Kosovo. On 2 April 1981 the Presidency under chairmanship of Cvijetin Mijatović declared a state of emergency in Priština and Kosovska Mitrovica, which lasted one week. The Presidency declared the state of emergency again, that time on the whole territory of Kosovo, on 27 February 1989 under chairmanship of Raif Dizdarević, when even more serious disorders in Kosovo broke out. For the third time in post-Tito Yugoslavia, the state of emergency in Kosovo was imposed by the Presidency in February 1990.\n\nThe composition of the last Presidency elected in May 1989 reflected both approach of political pluralism in some parts of the federation and the beginning of agony in Yugoslavia:\nIn summer 1991 Mesić and Drnovšek, regarding their republics independent, ceased to attend sessions of the Presidency. They were followed by Bogićević and Vasil Tupurkovski from Macedonia, so that the Presidency de facto ceased to exist, although the members from Serbia, her provinces (Kosovo and Vojvodina) and Montenegro continued to hold sessions until 1992.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "1621432", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1621432", "title": "Right of asylum", "text": "Right of asylum\n\nThe right of asylum (sometimes called right of political asylum, from the Ancient Greek word ἄσυλον) is an ancient juridical concept, under which a person persecuted by one's own country may be protected by another sovereign authority, such as another country or church official, who in medieval times could offer sanctuary. This right was already recognized by the Egyptians, the Greeks, and the Hebrews, from whom it was adopted into Western tradition. René Descartes fled to the Netherlands, Voltaire to England, and Thomas Hobbes to France, because each state offered protection to persecuted foreigners.\n\nThe Egyptians, Greeks, and Hebrews recognized a religious \"right of asylum\", protecting criminals (or those accused of crime) from legal action to some extent. This principle was later adopted by the established Christian church, and various rules were developed that detailed how to qualify for protection and what degree of protection one would receive.\n\nThe Council of Orleans decided in 511, in the presence of Clovis I, that asylum could be granted to anyone who took refuge in a church or on church property, or at the home of a bishop. This protection was extended to murderers, thieves and adulterers alike.\n\nThat \"Everyone has the right to seek and to enjoy in other countries asylum from persecution\" is enshrined in the United Nations Universal Declaration of Human Rights of 1948 and supported by the 1951 Convention Relating to the Status of Refugees and the 1967 Protocol Relating to the Status of Refugees. Under these agreements, a refugee is a person who is outside that person's own country's territory owing to fear of persecution on protected grounds, including race, caste, nationality, religion, political opinions and participation in any particular social group or social activities.\n\nIn England, King Æthelberht of Kent proclaimed the first Anglo-Saxon laws on sanctuary in about 600 AD. However Geoffrey of Monmouth in his \"Historia Regum Britanniae\" (c. 1136) says that the legendary pre-Saxon king Dunvallo Molmutius (4th/5th century BC) enacted sanctuary laws among the Molmutine Laws as recorded by Gildas (c. 500–570). The term \"grith\" was used by the laws of king \"Ethelred\".\nBy the Norman era that followed 1066, two kinds of sanctuary had evolved: all churches had the lower-level powers and could grant sanctuary within the church proper, but the broader powers of churches licensed by royal charter extended sanctuary to a zone around the church. At least twenty-two churches had charters for this broader sanctuary, including\n\n\nSometimes the criminal had to get to the chapel itself to be protected, or ring a certain bell, hold a certain ring or door-knocker, or sit on a certain chair (\"frith-stool\"). Some of these items survive at various churches. Elsewhere, sanctuary held in an area around the church or abbey, sometimes extending in radius to as much as a mile and a half. Stone \"sanctuary crosses\" marked the boundaries of the area; some crosses still exist as well. Thus it could become a race between the felon and the medieval law officers to the nearest sanctuary boundary. Serving of justice upon the fleet of foot could prove a difficult proposition.\n\nChurch sanctuaries were regulated by common law. An asylum seeker had to confess his sins, surrender his weapons, and permit supervision by a church or abbey organization with jurisdiction. Seekers then had forty days to decide whether to surrender to secular authorities and stand trial for their alleged crimes, or to confess their guilt, abjure the realm, and go into exile by the shortest route and never return without the king's permission. Those who did return faced execution under the law and/or excommunication from the Church.\n\nIf the suspects chose to confess their guilt and abjure, they did so in a public ceremony, usually at the church gates. They would surrender their possessions to the church, and any landed property to the crown. The coroner, a medieval official, would then choose a port city from which the fugitive should leave England (though the fugitive sometimes had this privilege). The fugitive would set out barefooted and bareheaded, carrying a wooden cross-staff as a symbol of protection under the church. Theoretically they would stay to the main highway, reach the port and take the first ship out of England. In practice, however, the fugitive could get a safe distance away, abandon the cross-staff and take off and start a new life. However, one can safely assume the friends and relatives of the victim knew of this ploy and would do everything in their power to make sure this did not happen; or indeed that the fugitives never reached their intended port of call, becoming victims of vigilante justice under the pretense of a fugitive who wandered too far off the main highway while trying to \"escape.\"\n\nKnowing the grim options, some fugitives rejected both choices and opted for an escape from the asylum before the forty days were up. Others simply made no choice and did nothing. Since it was illegal for the victim's friends to break into an asylum, the church would deprive the fugitive of food and water until a decision was made.\n\nHenry VIII changed the rules of asylum, reducing to a short list the types of crimes for which people were allowed to claim asylum. The medieval system of asylum was finally abolished entirely by James I in 1623.\n\nDuring the Wars of the Roses, when the Yorkists or Lancastrians would suddenly get the upper hand by winning a battle, some adherents of the losing side might find themselves surrounded by adherents of the other side and not able to get back to their own side. Upon realizing this situation they would rush to sanctuary at the nearest church until it was safe to come out. A prime example is Queen Elizabeth Woodville, consort of Edward IV of England.\n\nIn 1470, when the Lancastrians briefly restored Henry VI to the throne, Queen Elizabeth was living in London with several young daughters. She moved with them into Westminster for sanctuary, living there in royal comfort until Edward IV was restored to the throne in 1471 and giving birth to their first son Edward V during that time. When King Edward IV died in 1483, Elizabeth (who was highly unpopular with even the Yorkists and probably did need protection) took her five daughters and youngest son (Richard, Duke of York) and again moved into sanctuary at Westminster. To be sure she had all the comforts of home, she brought so much furniture and so many chests that the workmen had to knock holes in some of the walls to get everything in fast enough to suit her.\n\nArticle 14 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights states that \"Everyone has the right to seek and to enjoy in other countries asylum from persecution.\" The United Nations 1951 Convention Relating to the Status of Refugees and the 1967 Protocol Relating to the Status of Refugees guides national legislation concerning political asylum. Under these agreements, a refugee (or for cases where repressing base means has been applied directly or environmentally to the refugee) is a person who is outside that person's own country's territory (or place of habitual residence if stateless) owing to fear of persecution on protected grounds. Protected grounds include race, caste, nationality, religion, political opinions and membership and/or participation in any particular social group or social activities. Rendering true victims of persecution to their persecutor is a violation of a principle called non-refoulement, part of the customary and trucial Law of Nations.\n\nThese are the accepted terms and criteria as principles and a fundamental part in the 1951 United Nations Convention Relating to the Status of Refugees non-refoulement order.\n\nSince the 1990s, victims of sexual persecution (which may include domestic violence, or systematic oppression of a gender or sexual minority) have come to be accepted in some countries as a legitimate category for asylum claims, when claimants can prove that the state is unable or unwilling to provide protection.\n\nAsylum in European Union Member States formed over a half-century by application of the Geneva Convention of 28 July 1951 on the Status of Refugees. Common policies appeared in the 1990s in connection with the Schengen Agreement (which suppressed internal borders) so that asylum seekers unsuccessful in one Member State would not reapply in another. The common policy began with the Dublin Convention in 1990. It continued with the implementation of Eurodac and the Dublin Regulation in 2003, and the October 2009 adoption of two proposals by the European Commission.\n\nFrance was the first country to recognize the constitutional right to asylum, this being enshrined in article 120 of the Constitution of 1793. The modern French right of asylum is recognized by the 1958 Constitution, \"vis-à-vis\" the paragraph 4 of the preamble to the Constitution of 1946, to which the Preamble of the 1958 Constitution directly refers. The Constitution of 1946 incorporated of parts of the 1793 constitution which had guaranteed the right of asylum to \"anyone persecuted because of his action for freedom\" who are unable to seek protection in their home countries.\n\nIn addition to the constitutional right to asylum, the modern French right to asylum (\"droit d'asile\") is enshrined on a legal and regulatory basis in the \"Code de l'Entree et du Sejour des Etrangers et du Droit d'Asile\" (CESEDA).\n\nFrance also adheres to international agreements which provide for application modalities for the right of asylum, such as the 1951 United Nations (UN) Convention Relating to the Status of Refugees (ratified in 1952), the additional 1967 protocol; articles K1 and K2 of the 1992 Maastricht Treaty as well as the 1985 Schengen Agreement, which defined EU immigration policy. Finally, the right of asylum is defined by article 18 of the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union.\n\nSome of the criteria for which an asylum application can be rejected include: i) Passage via “safe\" third country, ii) Safe Country of Origin (An asylum seeker can be a prior refused asylum if he or she is a national of a country considered to be \"safe\" by the French asylum authority OFPRA), iii) Safety Threat (serious threat to the public order), or iv) Fraudulent Application (abuse of the asylum procedure for other reasons).\n\nThe December 10, 2003, law limited political asylum through two main restrictions:\n\nWhile restricted, the right of political asylum has been conserved in France amid various anti-immigration laws. Some people claim that, apart from the purely judicial path, the bureaucratic process is used to slow down and ultimately reject what might be considered as valid requests. According to \"Le Figaro\", France granted 7,000 people the status of political refugee in 2006, out of a total of 35,000 requests; in 2005, the OFPRA in charge of examining the legitimacy of such requests granted less than 10,000 from a total of 50,000 requests.\n\nNumerous exiles from South American dictatorships, particularly from Augusto Pinochet's Chile and the Dirty War in Argentina, were received in the 1970s-80s.\nSince the 2001 invasion of Afghanistan, tens of homeless Afghan asylum seekers have been sleeping in a park in Paris near the \"Gare de l'Est\" train station. Although their demands haven't been yet accepted, their presence has been tolerated. However, since the end of 2005, NGOs have been noting that the police separate Afghans from other migrants during raids, and expel via charters those who have just arrived at \"Gare de l'Est\" by train and haven't had time to demand asylum (a May 30, 2005, decree requires them to pay for a translator to help with official formalities).\n\nIn the 19th century, the United Kingdom accorded political asylum to various persecuted people, among whom were many members of the socialist movement (including Karl Marx). With the 1845 attempted bombing of the Greenwich Royal Observatory and the 1911 Siege of Sidney Street in the context of the propaganda of the deed (anarchist) actions, political asylum was restricted.\n\nThe United States recognizes the right of asylum of individuals as specified by international and federal law. A specified number of legally defined refugees who apply for refugee status overseas, as well as those applying for asylum after arriving in the U.S., are admitted annually.\n\nAs noted in the article specifically about asylum and refugees in the United States, since World War II, more refugees have found homes in the U.S. than any other nation and more than two million refugees have arrived in the U.S. since 1980. During much of the 1990s, the United States accepted over 100,000 refugees per year, though this figure has recently decreased to around 50,000 per year in the first decade of the 21st century, due to greater security concerns. As for asylum seekers, the latest statistics show that 86,400 persons sought sanctuary in the United States in 2001. Before the September 11 attacks individual asylum applicants were evaluated in private proceedings at the U.S. Immigration and Naturalization Services (INS).\n\nDespite this, concerns have been raised with the U.S. asylum and refugee determination processes. A recent empirical analysis by three legal scholars described the U.S. asylum process as a game of refugee roulette; that is to say that the outcome of asylum determinations depends in large part on the personality of the particular adjudicator to whom an application is randomly assigned, rather than on the merits of the case. The very low numbers of Iraqi refugees accepted between 2003 and 2007 exemplifies concerns about the United States' refugee processes. The Foreign Policy Association reported that \"Perhaps the most perplexing component of the Iraq refugee crisis... has been the inability for the U.S. to absorb more Iraqis following the 2003 invasion of the country. To date, the U.S. has granted less than 800 Iraqis refugee status, just 133 in 2007. By contrast, the U.S. granted asylum to more than 100,000 Vietnamese refugees during the Vietnam War.\" \n\n\n"}
{"id": "333296", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=333296", "title": "Sheffield Rally", "text": "Sheffield Rally\n\nThe Sheffield Rally was a political event held by the Labour Party on Wednesday 1 April 1992, a week ahead of the 1992 UK general election on 9 April.\n\nAn event in preparation for eighteen months, the rally was held at the Sheffield Arena, an indoor sports venue in Sheffield, England. It was attended by 10,000 Labour Party members, including the entire shadow cabinet, and is reported to have cost some £100,000 to stage. It was the idea of strategist Philip Gould, who was involved in the subsequent successful election campaign of Bill Clinton later that year. The party leader, Neil Kinnock, was flown into the city by helicopter.\n\nThe rally was modelled partly on American presidential campaign conventions, with sound and light performances on the stage and celebrity endorsements played on a large video screen. At one point in the proceedings, Kinnock and the shadow cabinet paraded to the stage from the back of the venue, passing through an increasingly enthusiastic audience, with the shadow cabinet being introduced with titles such as \"The next Home Secretary\" and \"The next Prime Minister\"; Labour had been in opposition for 13 years and had already lost three consecutive general elections to the Conservatives.\n\nThis culminated in an emotional and animated Kinnock taking the podium and repeatedly shouting \"We're all right!\", which has often been re-broadcast since as an example of overconfident campaigning. Kinnock followed this by proclaiming \"We'd better get some talking done here, serious talking.\"\n\nAlthough Labour's internal polls at the time suggested the event had little effect on the level of support for the party, media commentators, and some prominent Labour politicians, thought the rally came over as \"triumphalist\" to television viewers of subsequent news programmes.\n\nThe election eight days later was a victory for the Conservatives, who finished 8% ahead of Labour in voting, but with a much smaller parliamentary majority than in 1987. It is widely regarded as one of the most surprising election results of the 20th century, as pollsters had predicted a narrow Labour majority or a hung parliament.\n\nMirroring Labour's poll results, several analysts and major participants in the campaign believe it actually had little effect. Jim Parish, Senior Campaigns Officer for the Labour Party from 1985 to 1993 and an organiser of the rally, wrote: \"The catastrophic 6–7 per cent drop in Labour support occurred before the rally and was – I am reliably informed – known in Sheffield that night.\"\n\nSome accounts suggest the event only received widespread attention after the election, an opinion Kinnock shared in April 2010: \"It wasn't until about ten days after the election that people started writing about the 'hubristic Sheffield rally' and all the rest of it.\"\n\nIn a 1995 interview for the BBC Two documentary series \"The Wilderness Years\", Kinnock said: \"...all of the years in which I'd attempted to build a fairly reserved, starchy persona – in a few seconds, they slipped away.\" In the 2010 \"New Statesman\" interview, Kinnock clarified his opinion on the effect of his performance at the rally. He said: \"Given my time again, I wouldn't repeat it – but the great legend is complete, bloody rubbish.\"\n\n"}
{"id": "466361", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=466361", "title": "Socialist Party (Ireland)", "text": "Socialist Party (Ireland)\n\nThe Socialist Party is a Trotskyist political party in Ireland, active in both the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland. Internationally, it is affiliated to the Trotskyist Committee for a Workers' International. Party members Ruth Coppinger, Mick Barry and Paul Murphy, were elected as TDs in the 32nd Dáil under the banner of \"AAA-PBP\". \nThe Socialist Party has been involved in various populist campaigns including the Anti-Bin Tax Campaign and the Campaign Against Home and Water Taxes. Members of the party were jailed for their part in the former, while members have been arrested for their role in the latter. The Socialist Party has also been credited with bringing to light the GAMA construction scandal. It had a seat in the European Parliament from 2009 to 2014. In 2015, the party received state funding of €132,000.\n\nFrom 2014, the party's election candidates in the Republic stood for office on behalf of the Anti-Austerity Alliance (AAA), now Solidarity, which was a registered party in its own right between 2014 and 2015 and which continues to contest elections as part of Solidarity–People Before Profit (S–PBP).\n\nThe party was formed by former members of the Labour Party, collectively known as the Militant Tendency, who were expelled in 1989 having been accused of Trotskyist entryism. They formed Militant Labour, which became the Socialist Party in 1996.\n\nThe party was founded in 1972 as a tendency within the Labour Party, grouped around the newsletter \"Militant Irish Monthly\". The tendency organised within the Labour Party throughout the 1970s and 1980s, attempting to win the party towards socialism, and briefly controlled Labour Youth from 1983 to 1986. People associated with it include Dermot Connolly, Clare Daly, Finn Geaney, Joe Higgins and John Throne. In the late 1980s, a number of known members were expelled from Labour. In 1989 they established an independent party, adopting the title Militant Labour—also used by other sections of the Committee for a Workers' International at the time. In 1996 the party merged fully with the Labour and Trade Union Group of Northern Ireland and changed its name to the Socialist Party. The Socialist Party has been particularly successful at building electoral support in the Republic of Ireland. It found it harder to gain an electoral foothold in Northern Ireland, but it has maintained a minor presence in the trade union movement there, as well as a youth wing.\n\nMilitant Labour was renamed the Socialist Party in 1996, and came to wider attention among the general public when Joe Higgins polled just 252 votes behind victor Brian Lenihan Jnr in the Dublin-West by-election. In the general election of the following year, Higgins was elected to Dáil Éireann for the first time.\n\nAt the 2002 general election, Joe Higgins retained his Dublin West seat in Dáil Éireann. Clare Daly narrowly missed out on gaining a second seat for the party in the Dublin North constituency.\n\nThe Anti-Bin Tax Campaign came about at this time. On 19 September 2003, Higgins and Daly were sent to Mountjoy Prison for a month after refusing to abide by a High Court injunction relating to the blockading of bin lorries.\n\nAt the 2004 local elections, the Socialist Party gained two council seats, with Mick Murphy being elected to South Dublin County Council and Mick Barry being elected to Cork City Council. The party also retained their two previous seats (held by Daly and Ruth Coppinger) on Fingal County Council. At the European election held on the same day, Joe Higgins received 23,218 (5.5%) votes in the Dublin constituency, but did not win a seat.\n\nCouncillor Mick Murphy was responsible for bringing the GAMA construction scandal to light in October 2004. This involved a group of Turkish workers being brought to Ireland by GAMA, a Turkish construction company. They were illegally underpaid and forced to work hours in breach of the EU Working Time Directive. Murphy discovered the workers living on the building site where they were employed. After contacting the local council, GAMA and trade union officials and remaining unenlightened, Murphy wrote a leaflet in English, had it translated into Turkish \"mainly to say that we had no problem with them being here, and saying what GAMA had said\", then threw it over the hoarding surrounding the site. Murphy brought it to the attention of his party colleague Joe Higgins, who was then a TD for Dublin West, and Higgins raised the matter in Dáil Éireann on 8 February 2005, bringing public awareness to the workers' plight. The exploitation included migrant Turkish construction workers bring employed on state projects, being paid as little as €2.20 an hour (the minimum wage in Ireland was €7.00) while being forced to work up to 80 hours per week. This led to a strike by immigrant workers in Ireland. The exploited workers each won tens of thousand of euro worth of unpaid wages and overtime.\n\nAt the 2007 general election, Joe Higgins lost his Dublin West seat and the Socialist Party was left without a TD for the first time since 1997. The Party campaigned for a \"no\" vote the 2008 and 2009 referenda on the Treaty of Lisbon.\n\nAt the 2009 European and local elections, Joe Higgins won a seat in the Dublin constituency with 50,510 (12.4%) first preference votes, as well as gaining a seat in the Castleknock local electoral area of Fingal County Council. The party held its seats on Fingal County and Cork City Council (Ruth Coppinger and Mick Barry respectively), while gaining one seat each on Balbriggan Town Council and Drogheda Borough Council. However, the party lost Mick Murphy, its only councillor on South Dublin County Council.\n\nAt the 2011 general election the Socialist Party returned two TDs to Dáil Éireann: Clare Daly was elected for the Dublin North constituency, while Joe Higgins regained his seat in Dublin West. The Socialist Party contested this election as part of the United Left Alliance (ULA), an alliance of far-left parties which included both People Before Profit (PBP) and Workers and Unemployed Action Group (WUAG), as well as independent activists. The Alliance won five seats in the national parliament. Higgins resigned his European Parliament seat, and Paul Murphy was selected by the party to replace him. Following the death of Brian Lenihan Jnr, the Socialist Party contested the 2011 Dublin West by-election, with its candidate Ruth Coppinger coming in third. The Socialist Party also called for a referendum on the December 2011 EU deal, which it opposed.\n\nIn 2012, legal advice was sought when it emerged that the expenses given to Higgins and Daly as TDs may have been used for travel outside their constituencies and journeys to the Dáil. Public expenditure minister Brendan Howlin subsequently confirmed that TDs were, in fact, entitled to claim expenses for travel outside their constituencies and that Daly and Higgins were guilty of no wrongdoing. The Socialist Party and ULA said the story was a \"manufactured controversy\", part of a \"vindictive smear campaign by Independent Newspapers\", which were owned by billionaire Denis O'Brien.\n\nClare Daly resigned from the Socialist Party in August 2012, following a dispute over her support of Independent TD Mick Wallace, whom the party had called on to resign after the revelation of tax irregularities. The Socialist Party left the ULA in January 2013.\n\nSocialist Party members contested the 2014 local elections as part of the Anti-Austerity Alliance. The party gained seats on Limerick and Cork City Councils, making it \"a national rather than Dublin-centric alliance\". The Dublin West by-election of the same day returned Ruth Coppinger to Dáil Éireann, giving Dublin West two Socialist Party TDs. Paul Murphy was unsuccessful in retaining the Socialist Party's European seat at this time but was elected to Dáil Éireann that October after a surprise victory in the Dublin South-West by-election, which the Sinn Féin candidate had been favourite to win.\n\nThe party altered its registered name in 2014 to Stop the Water Tax – Socialist Party. In 2015, water charge protestors, including party elected representatives Paul Murphy, Kieran Mahon and Mick Murphy, were arrested. The arrests led to accusations of \"political policing\" and sparked minor solidarity protests across Europe, including in London, Berlin, Vienna and Stockholm.\n\nIn the 2016 general election Murphy and Coppinger were re-elected in Dublin South-West and Dublin West, respectively, and Barry was elected in Cork North-Central, all of them running as Anti-Austerity Alliance–People Before Profit members.\nFor the 2016 Assembly Election, the Socialist Party in Northern Ireland supported Cross-Community Labour Alternative and critically called for a vote for the People Before Profit as the two parties did not stand candidates in the same constituencies.\n\nAccording to its website, the Socialist Party \"stands for the socialist alternative to the dictatorship of the markets – namely real democracy whereby ordinary people take centre stage in running society, with democratic public ownership of banks, of key sectors of the economy and industry, and a democratic plan of the economy to provide for the needs of people\". It opposes the so-called \"Social Partnership\" deals and those in the trade union movement who advocate them, considering the agreements detrimental to the well-being of workers. It also holds influence in the Northern Irish branch of the FBU, where its members played a key role in encouraging the FBU's split from the British Labour Party in 2004, as well as influence in NIPSA with members in the NIPSA Broad Left faction.\n\nThe Socialist Party is Eurosceptic. \nThe Socialist Party is involved in many community campaigns, including the 1996 Anti Water Tax Campaign, the 2003–2004 Anti-Bin Tax Campaign and the current Campaign Against Home and Water Taxes. It opposes the U.S-led wars on Iraq and Afghanistan, the occupation of Palestine, targeted killings and drone warfare in Pakistan, Yemen and elsewhere and continues to be active in campaigns against fascism, racism, low pay exploitation and religious sectarianism. They claim to advocate on behalf of, and support, workers, women in the home, LGBT people and ethnic minorities.\n\nRegarding the divided north, the Socialist Party opposes sectarian divisions between Protestants and Catholics and seeks to bring working class unity to both sides of the border. They argue that capitalism is incapable of overcoming sectarianism. The Socialist Party take a critical view of the Good Friday Agreement and other subsequent initiatives, claiming it further entrenches and institutionalises sectarianism and doesn't work towards solving the fundamental causes of the conflict.\n\nSocialist Youth is the youth wing of the Socialist Party.\n\n\nThe Socialist Party has contested European elections in the Republic of Ireland but not in Northern Ireland.\nCurrent TDs who are members of the Solidarity–People Before Profit:\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2475948", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2475948", "title": "Sointula", "text": "Sointula\n\nSointula is an isolated village on Malcolm Island in British Columbia, Canada. Lying between Vancouver Island and the British Columbia mainland, northeast of Port McNeill and not far from Alert Bay, the island is part of the historic and present territory of the ‘Namgis First Nation. At the 2011 census, the village had a population of 576, down 3.0% from the 2006 census.\n\nThe name \"Sointula\" means \"Place of Harmony\" (literally 'the place of chord') in the Finnish language. A group of Finnish settlers founded the village in 1901 after rowing north from Nanaimo. They planned to set up a utopian socialist society known as the \"Kalevan Kansa\", and wrote to visionary Matti Kurikka in Finland to lead the new community. They were looking for a way out of the mines operated by the Dunsmuir family on Vancouver Island. It was a physically hard life, and a devastating fire in the Sointula community hall in 1903 killed three adults and eight children almost bringing the fledgling community to its knees. Kalervo Oberg, a Finnish-Canadian anthropologist born in 1901, came with his family to Sointula in 1902, and they were caught in the fire of 1903. Two of his sisters died in the fire.\n\nFinancial difficulties continued to plague the group. They worked for free for two years on the Capilano Bridge project, and after that the Kalevan Kansa was disbanded, but many of the community members remained on the island, as have their descendants.\n\nThe town remained and eventually prospered well into the 1970s as an unusually vibrant resource-based settlement. Fishing and logging activities have been the mainstay for the community. The early cooperative ventures led to other businesses that are still operating, planting seeds that are also alive today. The Sointula Cooperative Store, the oldest co-op shop in the province, still handles dry goods, groceries and fuel for the islanders. In addition there is a cooperative bakery, Wild Island Foods, which served Finnish bread (\"pulla\") and home-cooked meals until the summer of 2008. The shellfish cooperative, Malcolm Island Shellfish Coop (MISC), was involved in research on the feasibility of raising and selling abalone, but closed for financial reasons in 2006. It relocated the abalone to an area near Port McNeill donated by Orca Sand and Gravel.\n\nJohn Phelps was proposed for the position of emperor during a briefly contemplated secession movement in the 1990s. The idea, which was fomented at a pub one night, turned out to be impractical, and the separation movement was abandoned. \n\nIn the 21st century, declining forestry and fishing industries have hit Sointula hard. Its school-age population has shrunk, although housing prices have risen, as owners from as far as California have bought homes as summer retreats. Sointula is home to the Sointula Museum, and produces an online newsletter, the \"Sointula Ripple\". It is easy to reach by car ferry, operated by BC Ferries from Port McNeill and Alert Bay.\n\nWildlife on the island and in the waters around it is abundant. Orca whales return to the so-called \"rubbing beaches\" on Malcolm Island's northern edge near Bere Point Regional Park every summer and fall. Seals and porpoises can be viewed from the beaches. Birds, mink, otter, beaver, and deer live all over the island. The temperate rainforest vegetation helps to sustain the mood of an uncluttered and peaceful haven.\n\nBill Gaston's novel \"Sointula\" (2004) is named for the community and has a plot that revolves in part around it. Rachel Lebowitz's book \"Hannus\" (2006) is also partly about the early days of the commune. Paula Wild's book \"Sointula\" gives a good overview of the island’s ways and history. More recently, Sointula Museum, collaborating with the University of Victoria, has published \"Practical Dreamers\", a history of the island's cooperatives complete with many historical pictures. In 2013 a Finnish troupe performed the play \"Sointula\" in the village. The troupe had raised $50,000 to be able to visit Sointula and perform.\n\nSointula is also the location of Living Oceans Society's head office, although it also has an office in Vancouver. Living Oceans Society, founded in 1998, is a non-profit research and public education organization committed to conserving marine biological diversity in order to ensure a healthy ocean and healthy coastal communities. It is Canada's largest non-governmental organization focused on marine conservation issues.\n\n"}

Controversies have arisen, for example, over whether private companies that run towns (the \"company-town\") and prisons (traditionally a state function) can be held liable as state actors when they violate fundamental civil rights. This question remains unresolved, but the Supreme Court has held private citizens to be liable as state actors when they conspire with government officials to deprive people of their rights.\n\nConversely, in \"National Collegiate Athletic Association v. Smith\", the Supreme Court has found that the National Collegiate Athletic Association is not a state actor for the purposes of 28 U.S.C. 1983 because it was national, rather than acting on behalf of one state actor. For the purposes of a Bivens\naction, however, it might still be a state actor.\n\nThe 1989 case of \"DeShaney v. Winnebago County\" was decided on the basis of the \"state action doctrine\". Social workers separated a young son Joshua from his abusive father Randy, but concluded there was not enough evidence for a permanent separation, and later reunited son with father; later, the father beat his son into a persistent vegetative state. The Supreme Court ruled that despite involvement by state social workers, the state of Wisconsin was not a \"state actor\" and was therefore not responsible. Accordingly, the Fourteenth Amendment protections did not apply, according to constitutional scholar John E. Finn.\n\nUnlike state actors, private actors are generally not required to afford individuals the constitutional rights mentioned above. In nearly all U.S. states, private shopping center owners can eject protesters from their land for trespassing, and private associations can eject members or deny admission to applicants, with no warning and for no reason. But in a handful of states, notably California, state constitutional protections and certain common law rights have been extended to limit private actors. California allows the peaceful exercise of free speech in private shopping centers (see \"Pruneyard Shopping Center v. Robins\" (1980)) and requires certain types of private actors to afford current or potential members a rudimentary version of procedural due process called fair procedure.\n\nThere are a number of situations where the United States Supreme Court has recognized the conduct of individuals or private organizations to be \"state action,\" and therefore subject to provisions of the Constitution such as Equal Protection, Due Process, or the First Amendment. The Supreme Court has held the following:\n\n\nAccording to constitutional law scholar Gillian E. Metzger:\n\nThe underlying presumption is that cases where private actors wield public power are rare and occur mainly when the government tries to hide behind private surrogates whom it controls. Current doctrine pays little attention to whether the government is, in fact, delegating power to private entities to act on its behalf. To the extent private delegations are considered, it is under the rubric of private delegation doctrine, which assesses whether the Constitution's separation of powers and due process requirements prohibit the government from delegating certain types of powers to private hands. But constitutional law makes no attempt to link the constitutionality of a private delegation to the risk that it will place government power outside of constitutional controls.\n\n"}

{"id": "1805790", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1805790", "title": "Territorial evolution of the British Empire", "text": "Territorial evolution of the British Empire\n\nThe territorial evolution of the British Empire is considered to have begun with the foundation of the English colonial empire in the late 16th century. Since then, many territories around the world have been under the control of the United Kingdom or its predecessor states.\n\nWhen the Kingdom of Great Britain was formed in 1707 by the union of the Kingdom of Scotland with the Kingdom of England, the latter country's colonial possessions passed to the new state. Similarly, when Great Britain was united with the Kingdom of Ireland in 1801 to form the United Kingdom, control over its colonial possessions passed to the latter state. Collectively, these territories are referred to as the British Empire. Upon much of Ireland gaining independence in 1922 as the Irish Free State, the other territories of the Empire remained under the control of the United Kingdom.\n\nFrom 1714 to 1837 the British throne was held by a series of kings who were also the rulers of the German state of Hanover. However, this was purely a personal union, with Hanover maintaining its political independence otherwise, and so it is not usually considered to have formed part of the British Empire.\n\nThe nature of the territories (and peoples) ruled as part of the British Empire varied enormously. In legal terms the territories included those formally under the sovereignty of the British monarch (who held the additional title of Emperor (or Empress) of India from 1876 to 1947); various \"foreign\" territories controlled as protectorates; territories transferred to British administration under the authority of the League of Nations or the United Nations; and miscellaneous other territories, such as the Anglo-Egyptian Sudan, a condominium with Egypt. No uniform system of government was applied to any of these.\n\nA number of countries (dominions) within the British Empire gained independence in stages during the earlier part of the 20th century. Much of the rest of the Empire was dismantled in the twenty years following the end of the Second World War, starting with the independence of India and Pakistan in 1947, and considered to have ended with the handover of Hong Kong to China in 1997. There remain, however, 14 global territories which remain under the jurisdiction and sovereignty of the United Kingdom.\n\nMany of the former territories of the British Empire are members of the Commonwealth of Nations. Fifteen of these (known, with the United Kingdom, as the 16 Commonwealth realms) retain the British monarch (currently Queen Elizabeth II) as Head of State. The British monarch is also Head of the Commonwealth, but this is a purely symbolic and personal title; members of the Commonwealth (including the Commonwealth realms) are fully sovereign states. \n\nThe British Empire refers to the possessions, dominions and dependencies under the control of the Crown. In addition to the areas formally under the sovereignty of the British monarch, various \"foreign\" territories were controlled as protectorates; territories transferred to British administration under the authority of the League of Nations or the United Nations; and miscellaneous other territories, such as the condominium of Anglo-Egyptian Sudan. The natures of the administration of the Empire changed both by time and place, and there was no uniform system of government in the Empire.\n\nColonies were territories that were intended to be places of permanent settlement, providing land for their settlers. The Crown claimed absolute sovereignty over them, although they were not formally part of the United Kingdom itself. Generally their law was the common law of England together with whatever British Acts of Parliament were also applied to them. Over time, a number of colonies were granted \"responsible government\", making them largely self-governing.\n\nA Crown colony was a type of colonial administration of the English and later the British Empire, whose legislature and administration were controlled by the Crown.\nCrown colonies were ruled by a governor appointed by the monarch. By the middle of the 19th century, the sovereign appointed royal governors on the advice of the Secretary of State for the Colonies. This became the main method of creating and governing colonies. Most Crown colonies, especially the white settler colonies had a bicameral legislature, consisting of an upper house usually called the Legislative council, which members were appointed and served a similar purpose as the British House of Lords. There also existed lower houses which were usually named the Legislative Assembly or House of Assembly. The lower house was usually elected, but suffrage was restricted to free white men only, usually with property ownership restrictions. Since land ownership was widespread, most white men could vote. The governor also often had an Executive Council which had a similar function to the Cabinet in England but was not responsible to the colonial lower house. They held a consultative position, however, and did not serve in administrative offices as cabinet ministers do. Members of the Executive Council were not necessarily members of the lower house but were usually members of the upper house. Later as the white colonies gained more internal responsible government, the lower house began to supersede the (usually unelected) upper house as the colonial legislature, and the position of Premier emerged.\n\nCharter colony is one of the three classes of colonial government established in the 17th-century English colonies in North America. In a charter colony, the King granted a charter to the colonial government establishing the rules under which the colony was to be governed and charter colonies elected their own governors based on rules spelled out in the charter or other colonial legislation.\n\nA number of colonies in the 16th and 17th centuries were granted to a particular individual; these were known as proprietary colonies. Proprietary colonies in America were governed by a Lord Proprietor, who, holding authority by virtue of a royal charter, usually exercised that authority almost as an independent sovereign. Eventually these were converted to Crown colonies.\n\nA chartered company is an association formed by investors or shareholders for the purpose of trade, exploration and colonisation. Chartered companies were usually formed, incorporated and legitimised under a royal charter. This document set out the terms under which the company could trade, defined its boundaries of influence, and described its rights and responsibilities. Groups of investors formed companies to underwrite and profit from the exploration of Africa, India, Asia, the Caribbean and North America, under the patronage of the state. Some companies such as the East India Company ruled large colonial possessions (especially in India).\n\nA protectorate is a territory which is not formally annexed but in which, by treaty, grant or other lawful means, the Crown has power and jurisdiction. A protectorate differs from a \"protected state\". A protected state is a territory under a foreign ruler which enjoys British protection, over whose foreign affairs she exercises control, but in respect of whose internal affairs she does not exercise jurisdiction.\n\nDominions were semi-independent polities that were nominally under the Crown, constituting the British Empire and British Commonwealth, beginning in the later part of the 19th century. The dominions had been previously Crown colonies, and some of the colonies had been united to form dominions such as Union of South Africa and Commonwealth of Australia. Dominion status was formally defined in the Balfour Declaration of 1926, which recognised these countries as \"autonomous Communities within the British Empire\", thus acknowledging them as political equals of the United Kingdom; the Statute of Westminster 1931 converted this status into legal reality, making them essentially independent members of what was then called the British Commonwealth. Initially, the Dominions conducted their own trade policy, some limited foreign relations and had autonomous armed forces, although the British government claimed and exercised the exclusive power to declare wars. However, after the passage of the Statute of Westminster the language of dependency on the Crown of the United Kingdom ceased, where the Crown itself was no longer referred to as the Crown of any place in particular but simply as \"the Crown\". Arthur Berriedale Keith, in Speeches and Documents on the British Dominions 1918–1931, stated that \"the Dominions are sovereign international States in the sense that the King in respect of each of His Dominions (Newfoundland excepted) is such a State in the eyes of international law\". After then, those countries that were previously referred to as \"Dominions\" became Commonwealth realms where the sovereign reigns no longer as the British monarch, but as monarch of each nation in its own right, and are considered equal to the United Kingdom and one another.\nMandates were forms of territory created after the end of the First World War. A number of German colonies and protectorates and Ottoman provinces were held as mandates by the United Kingdom (Tanganyika, British Cameroons, Togoland, Palestine and Mesopotamia, and its dominions of Australia (New Guinea, Nauru) New Zealand (Western Samoa, and South Africa (South West Africa). In theory these territories were governed on behalf of the League of Nations for the benefit of their inhabitants. Most converted to United Nations Trust Territories in 1946.\n\nThe British Raj, also called the Indian Empire, was the imperial political structure in the Indian subcontinent between 1858 and 1947, comprising British India (a Crown colony: presidencies and provinces directly governed by the British Crown through the Viceroy and Governor-General of India) and Princely States, governed by Indian rulers, under the suzerainty of the British Crown exercised through the Viceroy and Governor-General of India.\n\nWithin twenty years of the partition and independence in 1947 of British India (considered to be the most important colonial possession), most of the Empire's territories had achieved full independence. Today 14 former colonies (since 2002 known as British Overseas Territories) remain under British rule; the term \"colonies\" is no longer officially used to describe these.\n\nAlmost all of the British Overseas Territories are islands (or groups of islands) with a small population; some are in very remote areas of the world. Of the territories with a permanent population, all have at least some degree of internal self-government, with the United Kingdom retaining responsibility for defence and external relations.\n\nThe fourteen British Overseas Territories are:\n\nThe three Crown dependencies are:\n\nThis is a listing of the more important treaties, Acts of Parliament, and other legal instruments and events affecting the nature and territorial extent of the British Empire.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "445658", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=445658", "title": "Velupillai Prabhakaran", "text": "Velupillai Prabhakaran\n\nThiruvenkadam Velupillai Prabhakaran (; ; , 26 November 1954 19 May 2009) was the founder and leader of the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (the LTTE or the Tamil Tigers), a militant organization that sought to create an independent Tamil state in the north and east of Sri Lanka.\n\nFor over 25 years, the LTTE waged war in Sri Lanka to create an independent state for the Sri Lankan Tamil people. Founded in 1976, the LTTE rocketed to prominence in 1983 after they ambushed a patrol of the Sri Lanka Army outside Jaffna, resulting in the deaths of 13 soldiers. This ambush, along with the subsequent rioting which resulted in the deaths of hundreds of Tamil civilians, is generally considered the start of the Sri Lankan Civil War. After years of fighting, including the intervention of the Indian Army (IPKF), the conflict was halted after international mediation in 2001. By then, the LTTE also known as the \"Tamil Tigers\" controlled large swathes of land in the north and east of the country, running a de facto state with Prabhakaran serving as its leader. Peace talks eventually broke down, and the Sri Lanka Army launched a military campaign to defeat the Tamil Tigers in 2006.\n\nPrabhakaran was reportedly killed in the fighting with the Sri Lankan Army on 18 May 2009. The troops also claimed to have found the body of Charles Anthony, 24, Prabhakaran's son. His wife's and daughter's bodies were reportedly found by the Sri Lankan army but the report was later denied by the Sri Lankan government. It was alleged that his 12-year-old second son was executed a short time later. Prabhakaran's reported death and the announcement \"We have decided to silence our guns. Our only regrets are for the lives lost and that we could not hold out for longer,\" by Selvarasa Pathmanathan, the Tigers' chief of international relations brought an end to the armed conflict.\n\nVelupillai Prabhakaran was born in the northern coastal town of Valvettithurai on 26 November 1954, as the youngest of four children to Thiruvenkadam Velupillai and his wife Vallipuram Parvathy. Thiruvenkadam Velupillai was the District land Officer in the Ceylon Government His family was an influential and wealthy family who owned and managed the major Hindu temples in Valvettithurai.\n\nAngered by what he saw as discrimination against Tamil people by successive Sri Lankan governments, he joined the student group \"Tamil Youth Front\" (TYF) during the standardisation debates. In 1972 Prabhakaran founded the Tamil New Tigers (TNT) which was a successor to many earlier organizations that protested against the post-colonial political direction of the country, in which the minority Sri Lankan Tamils were pitted against the majority Sinhalese people.\n\nIn 1975, after becoming heavily involved in the Tamil movement, he carried out the first major political assassination by a Tamil group, killing the mayor of Jaffna, Alfred Duraiappah, by shooting him at point-blank range when he was about to enter the Hindu temple at Ponnaalai. The assassination was in response to the 1974 Tamil conference incident, for which the Tamil radicals had blamed Duraiappah, because he backed the then ruling Sri Lanka Freedom Party.\n\nIn the early 1970s, United Front government of Sirimavo Bandaranaike introduced the Policy of standardisation which made the criteria for university admission lower for the Sinhalese than for the Tamils. Several organizations to counter this act was formed by Tamil students. Prabhakaran aged 15, dropped out of school and got associated with the \"Kuttimani-Thangathurai\" \"group\" (which evolved later into TELO) formed by Selvarajah Yogachandran (known as Kuttimani) and Nadarajah Thangathurai who both also hailed from Valvettithurai.\n\nPrabhakaran along with Kuttimani, Ponnuthurai Sivakumaran and other prominent rebels joined the \"Tamil Manavar Peravai\" formed by a student named \"Satiyaseelan\" in 1970. This group comprised Tamil youth who advocated the rights of students to have fair enrollment.\n\nIn 1973, Prabhakaran teamed up with \"Chetti Thanabalasingam\" and with a fraction of the Tamil Manavar Peravai to form the Tamil New Tigers (TNT). Their first notable attack was held at the Duraiappa stadium in Jaffna placing a bomb in an attempt to murder the Jaffna Mayor Alfred Duraiappah. A member of the Sri Lanka Freedom Party who was loyal to Sirimavo Bandaranaike, Duraiappah was seen as a traitor by the Tamil masses. Failing the attempt, Prabhakaran managed to shoot and kill Duraiappah who was on a visit at a Hindu temple at Ponnalai on the 27th July 1975.\n\nOn 5 May 1976, the TNT was renamed the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE), commonly known as the \"Tamil Tigers\". The LTTE by the 1980s operated in more attacks against police and military forces. On the 23rd July 1983, the LTTE ambushed an army patrol and killed 13 Sri Lankan soldiers in Thirunelveli, Sri Lanka. As a response to this were one of the worst government sponsored anti-Tamil riots held (the event known as \"Black July\") resulting in the destruction of Tamil houses and shops and death of hundreds of Tamils and making over 150 000 Tamils homeless.\n\nAs a result of the riots were several Tamils joining the LTTE and the LTTE marked the beginning of the Eelam War I. Prabhakaran held his first speech on the 4th August 1987 at the Suthumalai Amman temple in front of over 100 000 people explaining the position of the LTTE. This speech is seen as a historic turning point in the Sri Lankan Tamil nationalism.\n\nThe LTTE were allegedly involved in the assassination of Rajiv Gandhi, the ex-prime minister of India in 1991, which they denied involvement and alleged the event as an international conspiracy against them The Madras High Court in India issued an arrest warrant for plotting of the assassination of Rajiv Gandhi and Prabhakaran was made wanted by Interpol for terrorism, murder, organized crime and terrorism conspiracy. Prabhakaran's first and only major press conference was held in Killinochchi on 10 April 2002. It was reported that more than 200 journalists from the local and foreign media attended this event and they had to go through a 10-hour security screening before the event in which Anton Balasingham introduced the LTTE leader as the \"President and Prime minister of Tamil Eelam.\"\n\nA number of questions were asked about LTTE's commitment towards the erstwhile peace process and Prabhakaran and Dr. Anton Balasingham jointly answered the questions.\n\nRepeated questions of his involvement in the Rajiv Gandhi assassination were only answered in a sober note by both Balasingham and Prabhakaran. They called it a \"tragic incident\" (\"Thunbiyal Chambavam\", as quoted in Tamil) they requested the press \"not to dig into an incident that happened 10 years ago.\"\n\nDuring the interview he stated that the right condition has not risen to give up the demand of Tamil Eelam. He further mentioned that \"There are three fundamentals. That is Tamil homeland, Tamil nationality and Tamil right to self-determination. These are the fundamental demands of the Tamil people. Once these demands are accepted or a political solution is put forward by recognising these three fundamentals and our people are satisfied with the solutions we will consider giving up the demand for Eelam.\" He further added that Tamil Eelam was not only the demand of the LTTE but also the demand of the Tamil people.\n\nPrabhakaran also answered a number of questions in which he reaffirmed their commitment towards peace process, quoted \"We are sincerely committed to the peace process. It is because we are sincerely committed to peace that we continued a four month cessation of hostilities\" was also firm in de-proscription of the LTTE by Sri Lanka and India, \"We want the government of India to lift the ban on the LTTE. We will raise the issue at the appropriate time.\"\n\nPrabhakaran also insisted firmly that only de-proscription would bring forth an amenable solution to the ongoing peace process mediated by Norway: \"We have informed the government, we have told the Norwegians that de-proscription is a necessary condition for the commencements of talks.\"\n\nPrabhakaran was fascinated by Napoleon and Alexander the Great. He was also highly influenced by prominent Indian nationalists Subhas Chandra Bose and Bhagat Singh who fought the British Empire. Prabhakaran never developed a systematic philosophy, but did declare that his goal was 'Revolutionary socialism and the creation of an egalitarian society'. His rare interviews, his annual Tamil Eelam Heroes Day speeches and the policies and actions of the LTTE can be taken as indicators of Prabhakaran's philosophy and ideology. Religion was not a major factor in his philosophy or ideology, the ideology of the Tamil Tigers emerged from Marxist-Leninist thought, and was explicitly secular. Its leadership professed opposition to religion. Their focus was on a single-minded approach toward the attainment of an independent Tamil Eelam. The following are important areas when considering the philosophy and ideology of Prabhakaran.\n\nPrabhakaran's source of inspiration and direction was Sri Lankan Tamil nationalism. His stated and ultimate ideal was to get Tamil Eelam recognised as a nation as per the U.N. Charter that guarantees the right of a people to political independence. The LTTE also proposed the formation of an Interim Self Governing Authority during Peace Negotiations in 2003. Former Tamil guerrilla and politician Dharmalingam Sithadthan has remarked that Prabhakaran's \"dedication to the cause of the Tamil Eelam was unquestionable, he was the only man in Sri Lanka who could decide if there should be war or peace.\" Prabhakaran was also called \"Karikalan\" for his bravery and his administration (in reference to Karikala Chola, a famous Chola king who ruled in Sangam Age.)\nPrabhakaran explicitly stated that an armed struggle is the only way to resist asymmetric warfare, in which one side, that of the Sri Lankan government, is armed and the other comparatively unarmed. He argued that he chose military means only after observing that non–violent means have been ineffectual and obsolete, especially after the Thileepan incident. Thileepan, a colonel rank officer adopted Gandhian means to protest against the IPKF killings by staging a fast unto death from 15 September 1987, and by abstaining from food or water until 26 September, when he died in front of thousands of Tamils who had come there to fast along with him.\n\nTactically, Prabhakaran perfected the recruitment and use of suicide bomber units. His fighters usually took no prisoners and were notorious for assaults that often left every single enemy soldier dead. Interpol described him as someone who was \"very alert, known to use disguise and capable of handling sophisticated weaponry and explosives.\"\n\nWhen the Sri Lankan military rapidly advanced into the last LTTE held territory in the final days of 2008–2009 SLA Northern offensive, Prabhakaran and his top leadership retreated into Vellamullivaikkal, Mullaitivu. Fierce fighting occurred between LTTE and the Sri Lanka Army during these last few days. At around 3:00 a.m. on 18 May 2009, Prabhakaran's son Charles Anthony tried to break the defenses of the Army, but was unsuccessful. He died along with around 100 other LTTE fighters. Troops found 12 million rupees in his possession. By the noon of that day, reports emerged that Prabhakaran was killed by a rocket attack while trying to flee the conflict zone in a captured ambulance and his body was badly burned. But this rumor was proven false in a short while. Skirmishes occurred also in the evening of 18 May around eastern bank of Nandikadal lagoon. A team of LTTE cadres consisting of 30 most loyal bodyguards of Prabhakaran and Prabhakaran himself tried to sneak through the mangrove islands of Nandikadal to its west bank. It has been alleged that one bodyguard had a can of gasoline with him to burn the Tiger leader's body if he is killed or committed suicide. This was to prevent the enemy seizing his body. Clearing and mopping-up operations were carried out by troops under Colonel G. V. Ravipriya from 3:30 pm to 6:30 pm that evening. But they did not encounter this last group of LTTE fighters that day. At 7:30 am next morning, mopping-up operations started again. This time, they were confronted by the fighters, led by Prabhakaran himself. Fighting went on until 9.30 am 19 May 2009. The firing stopped as all LTTE fighters died in the battle. Troops started collecting bodies again. This time, Sergeant Muthu Banda, attached to Sri Lanka Army Task Force VIII, reported to its commander, Colonel G. V. Ravipriya, that a body similar to Velupillai Prabhakaran had been found. After the body, which was floating among the mangroves, was brought ashore, Colonel Ravipriya positively identified it as that of the leader of the LTTE. A dog tag marked \"001\", two pistols, a T56 rifle with telescopic sight, a satellite phone, and a canister filled with diabetic medicine were found along with the body.\n\nAt 12:15 pm army commander Sarath Fonseka officially announced Prabhakaran's death on TV. At around 1:00 pm his body was shown in Swarnavahini for the first time. Prabakaran's identity was confirmed by Karuna Amman, his former confidant, and through DNA testing against genetic material from his son, who had been killed earlier by the Sri Lankan military. Circumstantial evidence suggested that his death was caused by massive head trauma, several claims on his death have been made and its alleged that his death is due to a shot at close range. There are also allegations that he was executed, a claim vehemently denied by Sri Lankan authorities. Karuna Amman claimed Prabhakaran shot himself but it was denied by Fonseka who claimed the injury was from shrapnel citing the lack of an exit wound. A week later, the new Tamil Tiger leader, Selvarasa Pathmanathan, admitted that Prabhakaran was dead.\n\nPrabhakaran was married to Mathivathani Erambu on 1 October 1984. The military spokesman Udaya Nanayakkara stated in May 2009, that there was no information about the whereabouts of the remaining members of the Prabhakaran's family. “We have not found their bodies and have no information about them,” he said. However, it is thought that the entire Prabhakaran family has been wiped out; the bodies of Mathivathani, Duvaraga and Balachandran reportedly were found in a bushy patch about 600 meters away from where Prabhakaran's body was found. It is now believed that his 12-year-old son was executed.\n\nVelupillai Prabhakaran's parents, Thiruvenkadam Velupillai and Parvathi, both in their 70s, were found in the Menik Farm camp for displaced people near the town of Vavuniya. The Sri Lankan military and the government gave public assurances that they would not be interrogated, harmed or ill-treated. Prabhakaran's parents were then taken into Sri Lankan military custody until the death of Mr Vellupillai in January 2010. Prabhakaran has a sister named Vinodini Rajendaran.\n\n\n\n\n"}

The national youth leader of the White Nationalist Party was Ronnie Cooper, a teen from the South Yorkshire area who was exposed for his fascist beliefs by the \"Sunday People\" newspaper in 2003. Cooper is now understood to be a serving member of the Royal Navy.\n\nAlthough largely Yorkshire-based it also sought to expand elsewhere. In 2003 the group applied to march in Glasgow but it was rejected by the city council.\n\nThe WNP also sought to campaign in amongst loyalists in Northern Ireland, posting stickers and delivering leaflets in Ballymena, Coleraine, Antrim town and Ballymoney in the run-up to the Twelfth in 2003. The group, which emphasised its anti-Irish republican nature by using slogans such as \"hang IRA scum\" in its literature, claimed to have 80 members in the province in May of that year. In a move condemned by local politicians WNP flags were also placed on lampposts in Ballymena around the same time. Most of the party's stickers and flags were removed by parties of residents organised in opposition by the loyalist Progressive Unionist Party, which publicly condemned racism.\n\nIn 2004 the party also revealed plans to host a Blood & Honour music festival in Northern Ireland although a counter-campaign was organised to encourage venues to turn down the booking. The proposed gigs did not take place however.\n\nThe WNP was severely weakened in 2004 when the England First Party (EFP) broke away under Mark Cotterill. The WNP had intended to use that name when the Electoral Commission refused to register WNP as an official name; but after a dispute between Cotterill on the one side and Eddy Morrison and John G. Wood (the WNP's national organiser) on the other, the EFP group broke away to become a separate, English nationalist, party.\n\nThe WNP under Morrison and John G. Wood courted John Tyndall, although he refused to join as he did not feel that divisions were helpful. Eventually Eddy Morrison left the party and with John G. Wood and Kevin Watmough in 2005 formed the similar British People's Party.\n\nThe White Nationalist Party's inspiration was \"unashamedly nationalist socialist\" and opposed to \"all democracy\". The WP had a list of 32 policies, based on principles which included repatriation, opposition to populism, Zionism and homosexuality, and adherence to David Lane's fourteen words. The group is now vehemently opposed to the British National Party, viewing them as race traitors.\n"}

He was the founding leader of the Reform Party, New Zealand's second organised political party, from 1909 until his death.\n\nMassey was born in County Londonderry in Ireland. After migrating to New Zealand in 1870, Massey farmed near Auckland (earning his later nickname, \"Farmer Bill\") and assumed leadership in farmers' organisations. He entered parliament in 1894 as a conservative, and from 1894 to 1912 was a leader of the conservative opposition to the Liberal ministries of Richard Seddon and Joseph Ward. Massey became the first Reform Party Prime Minister following Ward's resignation in March 1912. Throughout his political career Massey was known for the particular support he showed for agrarian interests, as well as his opposition to organised labour. He pledged New Zealand's support for Britain during the First World War. \n\nMassey led his Reform Party through four elections, although only the 1919 election was a decisive victory over all other parties. After Richard Seddon, he is the second-longest-serving Prime Minister of New Zealand.\n\nMassey was born in 1856 into a Protestant farming family, and grew up in Limavady, County Londonderry in Ireland. His father John Massey and his mother Marianne (or Mary Anne) née Ferguson were tenant farmers, who also owned a small property. His family arrived in New Zealand on 21 October 1862 on board the \"Indian Empire\" as Nonconformist settlers, although Massey remained in Ireland for a further eight years to complete his education. After arriving on 10 December 1870 on the \"City of Auckland\", Massey worked as a farmhand for some years before acquiring his own farm in Mangere, south Auckland, in 1876. In 1882 Massey married his neighbour's daughter, Christina Allan Paul. They had seven children.\n\nMassey gradually became more prominent in his community. This was partly due to his civic involvement in the school board, the debating society,and farming associations. Because of his prominence in these circles, he became involved in political debate, working on behalf of rural conservatives against the Liberal Party government of John Ballance. William Massey was a member of the Orange Order, Oddfellows, and freemasons, and espoused British Israelite ideas.\n\nIn Massey stood as a candidate in the general election in the electorate, losing to the Liberal candidate, Benjamin Harris. In early 1894 he was invited to contest a by-election in the neighbouring electorate of Waitemata, and was victorious. In the 1896 election he stood for the Franklin electorate, which he represented until he died in 1925.\n\nMassey joined the ranks of the (mostly conservative) independent MPs opposing the Liberal Party, led by Richard Seddon. They were poorly organised and dispirited, and had little chance of unseating the Liberals. William Russell, the Leader of the Opposition, was able to command only 15 votes. Massey brought increased vigour to the conservative faction.\n\nWhile the conservatives rallied for a time, support for the Liberals increased markedly during the Second Boer War, leaving the conservatives devastated. Massey's political career survived the period: despite a challenge by William Herries, he remained the most prominent opponent to the Liberal Party.\n\nAfter Seddon's death the Liberals were led by Joseph Ward, who proved more vulnerable to Massey's attacks. In particular, Massey made gains by claiming that alleged corruption and cronyism within the civil service was ignored or abetted by the Liberal government. His conservative politics also benefited him when voters grew concerned about militant unionism and the supposed threat of socialism.\n\nIn February 1909, Massey announced the creation of the Reform Party from his New Zealand Political Reform League. The party was to be led by him and backed by his conservative colleagues.\n\nIn the 1911 election the Reform Party won more seats than the Liberal Party but did not gain an absolute majority. The Liberals, relying on support from independents who had not joined Reform, were able to stay in power until the following year, when they lost a vote of confidence.\n\nMassey was sworn in as Prime Minister on 10 July 1912. Two days later it was reported in the press on 12 July that he had accepted the appointment of Honorary Commandant of the Auckland District of the Legion of Frontiersmen. Some members of the Reform Party grew increasingly frustrated at Massey's dominance of the party. He earned the enmity of many workers with his harsh response to miners' and waterfront workers' strikes in 1912 and 1913. The use of force to deal with the strikers made Massey an object of hatred for the emerging left-wing, but conservatives (many of whom believed that the unions were controlled by the far left) generally supported him, saying that his methods were necessary. His association with the Legion of Frontiersmen assisted him greatly during this period as a number of mounted units, including Levin Troop, rode to Wellington in mufti and assisted as Special Constables. In the Levin Troop was a young Bernard Freyberg, who would shortly earn the Victoria Cross near Beaumont Hamel.\n\nAmongst the first Acts enacted by Massey's government was one that \"enabled some 13,000 Crown tenants to purchase their own farms.\"\n\nThe outbreak of the First World War diverted attention from these matters. The 1914 election left Massey and his political opponents stalemated in parliament, with neither side possessing enough support to govern effectively. Massey reluctantly invited Joseph Ward of the Liberals to form a war-time coalition, created in 1915. While Massey remained Prime Minister, Ward gained de facto status as joint leader. Massey and Ward travelled to Britain several times, both during and after the war, to discuss military co-operation and peace settlements. During his first visit, Massey visited New Zealand troops, listening to their complaints sympathetically. This angered some officials, who believed that Massey undermined the military leadership by conceding (in contrast to the official line) that conditions for the troops were unsatisfactory. The war reinforced Massey's strong belief in the British Empire and New Zealand's links with it. He attended the Peace Conference in 1919 and signed the Treaty of Versailles on behalf of New Zealand. Although turning down knighthoods and a peerage, he accepted appointment as a Grand Officer of the Order of the Crown (Belgium) from the King of Belgium in March 1921 and a Grand Officer of the Legion of Honour by the President of France in October 1921.\n\nPartly because of the difficulty in obtaining consensus to implement meaningful policies, the coalition government had grown increasingly unpopular by the end of the war. Massey was particularly worried by the rise of the Labour Party, which was growing increasingly influential. Massey also found himself fighting off criticism from within his own party, including charges that he was ignoring rural concerns. He dissolved the coalition in 1919, and fought both the Liberals and Labour on a platform of patriotism, stability, support for farmers, and a public works program. He successfully gained a majority.\n\nAccording to New Zealand historian Tony Wilson, Massey was known for his anti-Bolshevik and anti-Soviet sentiments. He disliked domestic socialist elements like the \"Red Feds\", the predecessor to the New Zealand Federation of Labour, and the New Zealand Labour Party. As Prime Minister, Massey was opposed to Communist influence. He regarded the Red Terror (1919–20) in the Soviet Union, which followed the Bolshevik Revolution in 1917, as proof of the \"inherently oppressive orientation\" of socialism. In response to the Red Scare the government passed the War Regulations Continuance Act, which continued wartime emergency regulations including censorship. This led to a ban on Communist-oriented literature, which continued to 1935.\n\nEconomic problems lessened support for Reform. In the 1922 election Massey lost his majority, and was forced to negotiate with independents to keep his government alive. He was also alarmed by the success of Labour, which was now only five seats behind the Liberals. He began to believe that the Liberals would eventually disappear, with their supporters being split, the socially liberal wing to Labour and the economically liberal wing to Reform. He set about trying to ensure that Reform's gain would be the greater.\n\nIn 1924 cancer forced him to relinquish many of his official duties, and the following year he died. The Massey Memorial was erected as his mausoleum in Wellington, paid for mostly by public subscription. Massey University is named after him, the name chosen because the university had a focus on agricultural science, matching Massey's own farming background.\n\n\nHis widow, Christina, was awarded the GBE in 1926, one year after his death.\n\nTwo of his sons became Reform MPs: Jack (1885–1964), who represented his father's Franklin electorate from 1928 to 1935, and from 1938 to 1957 for National; and Walter William (1882–1959), who represented Hauraki from 1931 to 1935.\n"}
