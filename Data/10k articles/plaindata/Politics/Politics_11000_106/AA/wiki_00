{"id": "40628116", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=40628116", "title": "Alter-globalization", "text": "Alter-globalization\n\nAlter-globalization (also known as alternative globalization or alter-mundialization—from the French alter-mondialisation—and overlapping with the global justice movement) is the name of a social movement whose proponents support global cooperation and interaction, but oppose what they describe as the negative effects of economic globalization, considering it to often work to the detriment of, or not adequately promote, human values such as environmental and climate protection, economic justice, labor protection, protection of indigenous cultures, peace and civil liberties.\n\nThe name may have been derived from a popular slogan of the movement, namely \"Another world is possible\", which came out of the World Social Forum. The alter-globalization movement is a cooperative movement designed to \"protest the direction and perceived negative economic, political, social, cultural and ecological consequences of neoliberal globalization\". Many alter-globalists seek to avoid the \"disestablishment of local economies and disastrous humanitarian consequences\". Most members of this movement shun the label \"anti-globalization\" as pejorative and incorrect since they actively support human activity on a global scale and do not oppose economic globalization \"per se\". \n\nInstead they see their movement as an alternative to what they term neo-liberal globalization in which international institutions (the World Trade Organization, World Bank, International Monetary Fund and the like) and major corporations devote themselves to enriching the developed world while giving little or no attention to what critics say are the detrimental effects of their actions on the people and environments of less developed countries, countries whose governments are often too weak or too corrupt to resist or regulate them. This is not to be confused with proletarian internationalism as put forth by communists in that alter-globalists do not necessarily oppose the free market, but a subset of free-market practices characterized by certain business attitudes and political policies that they say often lead to violations of human rights.\n\nThe term was coined against accusations of nationalism by neoliberal proponents of globalization, meaning a support of both humanism and universal values but a rejection of the Washington consensus and similar neoliberal policies. (\"Alter\" is Latin for \"other\", as in \"alternative\" and French \"autre\".) The \"alter-globalisation\" French movement was thus opposed to the \"Treaty establishing a Constitution for Europe\" on the grounds that it only advanced neoliberalism and an Anglo-Saxon economic model.\n\nOriginally developed in French as \"altermondialisme\", it has been borrowed into English in the form of \"altermondialism\" or \"altermondialisation\". It defines the stance of movements opposed to a neoliberal globalization, but favorable to a globalization respectful of human rights, the environment, national sovereignty and cultural diversity.\n\nFollowing the French usage of the word \"altermondialist\", the English counterpart \"alter-globalist\" may have been coined.\n\nThe term \"alter-globalization\" is derived from the term \"anti-globalization\", which journalists and others have used to describe the movement. Many French journalists in particular have since ceased using the term \"anti-globalisation\" in favor of \"alter-globalisation\". It is supposed to distinguish proponents of alter-globalization from different \"anti-globalization\" activists (those who are against any kind of globalization, namely nationalists, protectionists, communitarians and so on).\n\nEconomic integration via trade, financial flows, and investments had been occurring for many years, but the World Trade Organization Ministerial Conference of 1999 brought significant attention to the outcry against neoliberal economic integration through media coverage, support groups, and activists. Though this opposition first became highly popularized in the 1999 Seattle WTO protests, it can be traced back prior to the 1980s when the Washington Consensus became a dominant development in thinking and policy-making. The movement was later helped by Internet communications.\n\nThe 1970s saw resistance to global expansion by both government and non-government parties. U.S. Senator Frank Church was concerned with the role multinational corporations were beginning to play in global trade, and created a subcommittee that reviewed corporate practices to see if they were advancing U.S. interests or not (i.e. exporting jobs that could be kept within the United States). The results prompted some countries in the Global South (ranging from Tanzania to the Philippines) to call for rules and collective action that would raise or stabilize raw material prices, and increase Southern exports.\n\nAlter-globalization activists fight for better treatment of developing countries and their economies, workers rights, fair trade, and equal human rights. They oppose the exploitation of labor, outsourcing of jobs to foreign nations (though some argue this is a nationalistic rather than alter-globalist motive), pollution of local environments, and harm to foreign cultures to which jobs are outsourced. \n\nAspects of the movement include:\n\nAdvocates of alter-globalization have set up an online global news network, the Independent Media Center, to report on developments pertinent to the movement. Groups in favor of alter-globalization include ATTAC, an international trade reform network headquartered in France.\n\nThe largest forum for alter-globalization activity is the annual World Social Forum. The World Social Forum is intended as a democratic space organized in terms of the movement's values.\n\n\n"}

It is the childhood home of golf pro Mike Weir, winner of the 2003 Masters.\n\nBrights Grove was the site of Canada's first commune. In 1829, Brights Grove was established along the model of Robert Owen's New Lanark, Scotland project by Henry Jones (1776–1852). The colony was named 'Maxwell' and was a short-lived project. However, it has been argued by Canadian socialist historian Ian McKay that \"[t]he builders of the short-lived colony named Maxwell that Jones planted near Sarnia may well have been the first people in North America to call themselves 'socialists'.\"\n\nIn the 1970s, the Ontario Heritage Foundation erected an historical plaque recognizing the site with the following text:\nIn 1829, Henry Jones of Devon, England, a retired purser in the Royal Navy, brought a group of more than 50 emigrants from the United Kingdom to this area where he established a settlement on a tract of land on Lake Huron. An early supporter and dedicated follower of Robert Owen, the well-known British social reformer. [sic] Jones named the settlement \"Maxwell\" and organized the community on the basis of common ownership and collective living. The settlers built a large log house with community kitchen and dining-room but separate rooms for each family. A school and storehouse were added. Within a few years, however, disappointing harvests and the burning of the log house led the colonists gradually to abandon the enterprise.\n\nIn 1875, Col. Robert F. Faethorne built what is now known as the Faethorne House. Faethorne built the house on the most easterly of the five farms (the \"East Range\") into which the land grant of Henry Jones, Faethorne's father-in-law, had been divided. Robert Faethorne had married Jones' daughter, Elizabeth, and farmed the East Range. Faethorne was interested in race horses, imported trees to beautify his property and took an active part in the militia. In 1862, he was promoted to full colonel to command the local military district until after the Fenian alarms of 1866 and 1868.\n\nOn Faethorne's death in 1897, the house was sold to Angus Jamieson. In 1921, it was purchased by H.F. Holland who restored it and the grounds. In 1934, it achieved notoriety when John Labatt, of the brewing family, who had rented it for the summer, was kidnapped on his way to London. In 1938, the house was sold once more. Under the name of Wildwood, it began a long career as a summer resort and golf club. By 1978, it was badly in need of repairs when it passed into the hands of Sarnia Township. It was restored to its present condition and started a new life as the Brights Grove library and Gallery in the Grove.\n\nBrights Grove hosted many top performers at the Kenwick dance hall.\n\nIn the late 1940s, Kenwick-on-the-Lake was open air in the round. The venue served as a Saturday night destination for passengers of the SS \"Noronic\" that stopped at Sarnia on its trip around the Great Lakes from Toronto until it burnt out alongside the quay in Toronto.\nBands that performed at the dance hall include Duke Ellington, Count Basie, and Lionel Hampton. There was also boxing.\n\nLater years saw rock acts, such as Alice Cooper.\n\nThe structure was destroyed by fire and is now a basketball court on the lakefront.\n\nBrights Grove has two creeks that attract salmon during the spring fishery. Cow Creek and Perch Creek. The Bluewater Anglers in Sarnia stock salmon, rainbow trout, and brown trout into Lake Huron.\n\n\nThere are 8 kilometres of lakefront walking trails, half is on rural road and other on dedicated bike/walk path.\n\nBrights Grove is located halfway on a 25 km nature trail from Sarnia to Camlachie. It is a good rail path, crosses numerous creeks (including Cow & Perch Creek), and is well maintained. Visitors can do a loop of rail path and lakefront around Brights Grove of 20 km or more.\n\n"}

It has been awarded annually since 1950 by the German city of Aachen. It commemorates Charlemagne, ruler of the Frankish Empire and founder of what became the Holy Roman Empire, who resided and is buried at Aachen. Traditionally the award is given to the recipient on Ascension Day in a ceremony in the town hall of Aachen. In April 2008, the organisers of the Charlemagne Prize and the European Parliament jointly created a new European Charlemagne Youth Prize, which recognises contributions by young people towards the process of European integration. Patrons of the foundation are King Philippe of Belgium, King Felipe VI of Spain, and Henri, the Grand Duke of Luxembourg.\n\nOn 19 December 1949, Kurt Pfeiffer presented to the reading group \"Corona Legentium Aquensis\", which he had founded, his proposals for the prize: \"We have the honour of proposing annual presentation of an international prize for the most valuable contribution in the services of Western European understanding and work for the community, and in the services of humanity and world peace. This contribution may be in the field of literary, scientific, economic or political endeavour\".\n\nThe sponsors of the prize, the City of Aachen, refer to Charlemagne as the \"Founder of Western Culture\", and assert that under his reign, the City of Aachen was once the spiritual and political centre of the whole of what is now western Europe.\n\nThe first Charlemagne Prize was awarded to Richard von Coudenhove-Kalergi, the founder of the Pan-European Movement.\n\nFollowing the presentation of the award to the Italian Prime Minister Alcide de Gasperi in 1952, the International Charlemagne Prize of the City of Aachen has repeatedly sent messages going far beyond Germany and promoting the \"unity of Europe\".\n\nThe award sponsors assert that the list of Charlemagne Prize winners reflects the history of the European process of unification. They continue that it has been awarded to the founding fathers of the United Europe such as de Gasperi, Schuman, Monnet and Adenauer, and to those who have embodied hope for integration such as Edward Heath, Konstantin Karamanlis, and His Majesty Juan Carlos I.\n\nThe sponsors promote that the Charlemagne Prize is not only an expression of gratitude for lasting services for the unity of Europe, but also an encouragement and an expression of hopes and expectations directed towards the future. They quote Kurt Pfeiffer: \"the Charlemagne Prize reaches into the future, and at the same time it embodies an obligation - an obligation of the highest ethical value. It is directed at a voluntary union of the European peoples without constraint, so that in their newfound strength they may defend the highest earthly goods - freedom, humanity and peace - and safeguard the future of their children and children's children\".\n\nIn April 2008, the organisers of the Charlemagne Prize and the European Parliament jointly created a new European Charlemagne Youth Prize, which recognises contributions by young people towards the process of European integration.\n\n(The popes are counted only for the Vatican City)\n\n\n"}
{"id": "226168", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=226168", "title": "Commander", "text": "Commander\n\nCommander is a common naval and air force officer rank. Commander is also used as a rank or title in other formal organisations, including several police forces. \n\nCommander is also a generic term for an officer commanding any armed forces unit, for example \"platoon commander\", \"brigade commander\" and \"squadron commander\". In the police, terms such as \"borough commander\" and \"incident commander\" are used.\n\nCommander is a rank used in navies but is very rarely used as a rank in armies. The title, originally \"master and commander,\" originated in the 18th century to describe naval officers who commanded ships of war too large to be commanded by a lieutenant but too small to warrant the assignment of a post-captain and (before about 1770) a sailing-master; the commanding officer served as his own Master. In practice, these were usually unrated sloops-of-war of no more than 20 guns. The Royal Navy shortened \"master and commander\" to \"commander\" in 1794; however, the term \"master and commander\" remained (unofficially) in common parlance for several years. The equivalent American rank master commandant remained in use until changed to commander in 1838. A corresponding rank in some navies is frigate captain. In the 20th and 21st centuries, the rank has been assigned the NATO rank code of OF-4.\n\nVarious functions of commanding officers were also styled \"Commandeur\". In the navy of the Dutch Republic, anyone who commanded a ship or a fleet without having an appropriate rank to do so, could be called a Commandeur. This included ad hoc fleet Commanders and acting Captains (\"Luitenant-Commandeur\"). In the fleet of the Admiralty of Zealand however, \"commandeur\" was a formal rank, the equivalent of \"Schout-bij-nacht\" (Rear-Admiral) in the other Dutch admiralties. The Dutch use of the title as a rank lives on in the Royal Netherlands Navy, as the equivalent of Commodore. In the Royal Netherlands Air Force, however, this rank is known by the English spelling of Commodore which is the Dutch equivalent of the British Air Commodore.\n\nThe rank of commander in the Royal Australian Navy (RAN) is identical in description to that of a commander in the British Royal Navy. RAN chaplains who are in Division 1, 2 and 3 (of five divisions) have the equivalent rank standing of commanders. This means that to officers and NCOs below the rank of commander, lieutenant colonel. or wing commander, the chaplain is a superior.\n\nTo those officers ranked higher than commander, the chaplain is subordinate. Although this equivalency exists, RAN chaplains who are in Divisions 1, 2 and 3 do not actually wear the rank of commander, and they hold no command privilege.\n\nIn Denmark, the rank of commander exists as \"kommandørkaptajn\" (\"Commander captain\" or \"commanding captain\"), which is senior to captain (\"kaptajn\") and \"kommandør\" (\"commander\", which is senior to \"kommandørkaptajn\"..\n\nIn France, the rank of commander exists as \"capitaine de frégate\" (\"frigate captain\"). It is senior to \"capitaine de corvette\" (\"corvette captain\"), and junior to \"capitaine de vaisseau\" (\"ship-of-the-line captain\").\nThe rank of commander was used in the Imperial Japanese Navy, and continues to be used in the modern Japanese Maritime Self-Defense Force. Though the modern rank is translated as \"commander\" in English, its literal translation is \"captain second rank.\" The rank is equivalent to that of a commander in the U.S. Navy.\n\nCommander is a rank in the Military and Hospitaller Order of Saint Lazarus of Jerusalem, and is denoted by the post-nominal letters CLJ.\n\nThe corresponding rank in the Polish Navy is \"komandor porucznik\".\n\nIn the Russian Navy the equivalent rank to commander is \"captain of the second rank.\"\n\nThe rank was introduced in Russia by Peter the Great in 1722. From the introduction of the Russian Table of Ranks to its abolition in 1917, \"captain of the second rank\" was equal to a court councillor, at the sixth level out of 14 ranks. Until 1856 it was also conferred hereditary nobility on the holder.\n\nThe equivalent rank in the Soviet Navy from 1918 to 1935 was \"first mate\", (старпом корабля 1 ранга; \"starpom korablya pervogo ranga\"). The rank returned to the Imperial Russian Navy form of Captain 2nd rank in 1935. \n\nCommander is a naval rank in Scandinavia (\"Kommandør\" in Danish and Norwegian, \"Kommendör\" in Swedish) equivalent to the Anglo-American naval rank of captain. The Scandinavian the rank of commander is immediately above \"commander-captain\" (, , ), which is equivalent to the Anglo-American naval rank of commander.\n\nIn the Spanish Navy the equivalent rank to commander is \"capitán de fragata\".\n\nA commander in the Royal Navy is above the rank of lieutenant commander, below the rank of captain, and is equivalent in rank to a lieutenant colonel in the army. A commander may command a frigate, destroyer, submarine, aviation squadron or shore installation, or may serve on a staff.\n\nSince the British Royal Air Force's mid-rank officers' ranks are modelled on those of the Royal Navy, the term wing commander is used as a rank, and this is the equivalent of a lieutenant colonel in the army or a commander in the navy. The rank of wing commander is above that of squadron leader and below that of group captain.\n\nIn the former Royal Naval Air Service, which was merged with the Royal Flying Corps to form the Royal Air Force in 1918, the pilots held appointments as well as their normal ranks in the Royal Navy, and they wore insignia appropriate to the appointment instead of the rank. A flight commander wore a star above a lieutenant's two rank stripes, squadron commander wore two stars above two rank stripes (less than eight years' seniority) or two-and-a-half rank stripes (over eight years seniority), and wing commander wore three rank stripes. The rank stripes had the usual Royal Navy curl, and they were surmounted by an eagle.\n\nCommander (\"trung tá\") is a 2-star field grade officer of Vietnam People's Navy\n\nFor instance, as in various small colonial settlements (such as various Caribbean islands) commanding the garrison was the crux of the top job, the military title \"Commandeur\" could be used instead of a civilian gubernatorial style, not unlike the Portuguese Captain-major.\n\nIn the British Army, the term \"commander\" is officially applied to the non-commissioned officer in charge of a section (section commander), vehicle (vehicle commander) or gun (gun commander), to the subaltern or captain commanding a platoon (platoon commander), or to the brigadier commanding a brigade (brigade commander). Other officers commanding units are usually referred to as the officer commanding (OC), commanding officer (CO), general officer commanding (GOC), or general officer commanding-in-chief (GOC-C), depending on rank and position, although the term \"commander\" may be applied to them informally.\n\nIn the First Aid Nursing Yeomanry commander is a rank equivalent to major.\n\n\"Commandeur\" as title of colonial office was the case on the island of Tobago in the Dutch colony of Nieuw Walcheren ('New Walcheren')\n\nThe usage is similar to the United States Army, with the term \"commander\" usually applying to very senior officers only, typically at divisional level (major general).\n\nIn the Spanish Army, the Spanish Air Force and the Marine Infantry, the term commander is the literal translation of \"comandante\", the Spanish equivalent of a Commonwealth major. The Guardia Civil shares the Army ranks, and the officer commanding a house-garrison (usually a NCO or a lieutenant, depending on the size) is addressed as the \"comandante de puesto\" (post commander).\n\nIn the United States Army, the term \"commander\" is officially applied to the commanding officer of army units; hence, there are company commanders, battalion commanders, brigade commanders, and so forth. At the highest levels of U.S. military command structure, \"commander\" also refers to what used to be called commander-in-chief, or CINC, until October 24, 2002, although the term CINC is still used in casual speech.\n\nIn the Air Force, the term \"commander\" (abbreviated \"CC\" in office symbols, i.e. \"OG/CC\" for \"operations group commander\") is officially applied to the commanding officer of an Air Force unit; hence, there are flight commanders, squadron commanders, group commanders, wing commanders, and so forth. In rank, a flight commander is typically a lieutenant or captain, a squadron commander is typically a major or lieutenant colonel, a group commander is typically a colonel, and a wing commander is typically a senior colonel or a brigadier general.\n\nIn NASA spacecraft missions since the beginning of Project Gemini, one crew member on each spacecraft is designated as mission commander. The commander is the captain of the ship, and makes all real-time critical decisions on behalf of the crew and in coordination with the Mission Control Center (MCC).\n\nThe title of aircraft commander is used in civil aviation to refer to the pilot in command (commonly referred to as \"captain\", which is technically an airline rank and not related to the commander's role on board the aircraft).\n\nWithin the British police, commander is a chief officer rank in the two police forces responsible for law enforcement within London, the Metropolitan Police and City of London Police. In both forces, the rank is senior to chief superintendent; in the Metropolitan Police it is junior to deputy assistant commissioner and in the City of London Police it is junior to assistant commissioner. In forces outside London, the rank equates to assistant chief constable which bears the same insignia.\n\nThe Metropolitan Police introduced the rank in 1946, after the rank of deputy assistant commissioner was split in two, with senior DACs keeping that rank and title and junior DACs being regraded as commanders. The Metropolitan Police also used the rank of deputy commander, ranking just below that of commander, between 1946 and 1968.\n\nOfficers in charge of policing each of the London's boroughs are given the title \"borough commander\". However, most such officers do not hold the actual rank of commander but instead hold the rank of chief superintendent. An exception to this is the borough commander of Westminster, who actually holds the rank of commander due to the size, complexity, and high-profile nature of the borough.\n\nThe Metropolitan Police Service announced that by Summer 2018 the rank would be phased out, along with that of chief inspector. However, in August 2017 it was announced that the new Commissioner Cressida Dick had cancelled the plan to phase them out.\n\nThe rank badge worn by a commander or an assistant chief constable consists of crossed tipstaves within a wreath. Until the abolition of the rank of deputy commander in 1968, however, a commander wore the same badge of rank as a deputy assistant commissioner.\n\nIn Australia, commander is a rank used by the Victorian, Tasmanian, Western Australian, South Australian, and Australian Federal police forces. The insignia consists of a crown over three bath stars in a triangular formation, equivalent to a brigadier in the army. In all four forces, it is junior to the rank of assistant commissioner, and senior to the rank of chief superintendent, with the exception of Western Australia and Victoria where it is senior to the rank of superintendent.\n\nIn New South Wales the position of commander is instated to officers (usually superintendents) in charge of a command or unit.\n\nSome large police departments and sheriff's offices in the US have a commander rank. Most commonly, this is the next rank above captain. Examples of this include the Chicago Police Department, Los Angeles Police Department, San Francisco Police Department, Hawai'i County Police Department, Portland Police Bureau and Rochester Police Department. In others, such as the Phoenix Police Department and Saint Paul Police Department, a commander rank is the next rank above lieutenant, and is equivalent to captain.\n\nA commander in the LAPD is equivalent to an inspector in other large US departments (such as the NYPD); the LAPD rank was originally called inspector as well, but was changed in 1974 to commander after senior officers voiced a preference for the more military-sounding rank. The Metropolitan Police Department of the District of Columbia also uses the rank of commander, which is a grade above inspector and two grades above captain.\n\nThe insignia worn is usually a gold oak leaf (equivalent to an army major). It may alternatively be a silver oak leaf (equivalent to an army lieutenant colonel) or one or more stars.\nCommander is also used as a title in certain circumstances, such as the commander of a squad of detectives, who would usually be of the rank of lieutenant.\n\nThe Montreal police force, Service de police de la Ville de Montréal, uses the rank of commander.\n\nIn the Incident Command System the incident commander is in charge of the response to an emergency. The title may pass from person to person as the incident develops.\n\nThe title of Commander is used in chivalric orders such as the Sovereign Military Order of Malta for a member senior to a knight. The title of knight commander is often used to denote an even higher rank. These conventions are also used by most of the continental orders of chivalry. The United Kingdom uses different classifications.\n\nIn most of the British orders of knighthood, the grade of Knight (or Dame) Commander is the lowest grade of knighthood, but is above the grade of companion (which does not carry a knighthood). In the Royal Victorian Order and the Order of the British Empire, the grade of Commander is senior to the grade of Lieutenant or Officer respectively, but junior to that of Knight or Dame Commander. In the British Venerable Order of Saint John, a Commander ranks below a Knight.\n\n\"Commander\" may sometimes be used by laymen, usually applied to the person who is accountable for and holds authority over a group or the attempts of a group to achieve a common goal.\n\n\n"}

Each Connexions area (usually one local education authority or an education partnership of two nearby LEAs) may have a separate Common Application Process (CAP) website. This standardises the application, and allows students to know the whole complement of choices available - not just those in their local town, or local school or college.\n\nThe name Common Application Process, using websites for each Connexions area (LEA), is applying the UCAS method (of applying for university courses) to school admissions - to widen knowledge of the scope of courses available. It makes it a more up-front and transparent method, less informal, of applying to further education and GCSE courses. It also saves time and duplication, by not \"re-inventing the wheel\" each time a school has to design an application system - it has been combined into one for each Connexions area. It has only been possible since improved access to the internet has made it viable.\n\nIt is aimed specifically at people at school or college ages 14 to 19 and is linked to the local Connexions office (Connexions Centre) for that area. It is the infrastructure and interface for applications to education after 14, allowing easy access to the Area Wide Prospectus (AWP) for that Connexions area. It is a \"joined-up service\" of education application - Connexions itself is designed similarly as a \"joined-up service\".\n\nEducation of the age bracket from 14-19 was partly maintained by Learning and Skills Councils (LSCs) before replaced by Young People's Learning Agency (YPLA). The provision of 14-19 education has now been placed much more in the hands of local education authorities. Education at the 14-19 level is planned by Area Strategy Groups (ASGs) within each Connexions area, which look after the relevant district council areas.\n\nWhere the term \"Common Application Process\" is used in the context of English schools, it denotes an unambiguous and uniform method of application across the Connexions area. It is the responsibility of the relevant area (LEA or similar) to provide a CAP for all the courses available after 14.\n\nHowever although it is a common application, access to more demanding academic courses after 16 will depend on exam success at 16, and therefore not available to all.\n\nAt the moment the CAP is being trialled in some LEAs (or partnerships). The fundamental intention of the vast government IT project is to attract more people to stay on for training after 16, if only by preventing ignorance.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "6766", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=6766", "title": "Commonwealth", "text": "Commonwealth\n\nCommonwealth is a traditional English term for a political community founded for the common good. Historically it has sometimes been synonymous with \"republic\". The noun \"commonwealth\", meaning \"public welfare general good or advantage\" dates from the 15th century. Originally a phrase (the common-wealth or the common weal – echoed in the modern synonym \"public weal\") it comes from the old meaning of \"wealth\", which is \"well-being\", and is itself a loose translation of the Latin res publica (republic). The term literally meant \"common well-being\". In the 17th century, the definition of \"commonwealth\" expanded from its original sense of \"public welfare\" or \"commonweal\" to mean \"a state in which the supreme power is vested in the people; a republic or democratic state\".\n\nThe term evolved to become a title to a number of political entities. Three countries – Australia, the Bahamas, and Dominica – have the official title \"Commonwealth\", as do four U.S. states and two U.S. territories. More recently, the term has been used to name some fraternal associations of nations, most notably the Commonwealth of Nations, an organization primarily of former territories of the British Empire, which is often referred to as simply \"the Commonwealth\".\n\nTranslations of Roman writers' works to English have on occasion translated \"Res publica\", and variants thereof, to \"the commonwealth\", a term referring to the Roman state as a whole.\n\nThe Commonwealth of England was the official name of the political unit (\"de facto\" military rule in the name of parliamentary supremacy) that replaced the Kingdom of England (after the English Civil War) from 1649–53 and 1659–60, under the rule of Oliver Cromwell and his son and successor Richard. From 1653 to 1659, although still legally known as a Commonwealth, the republic, united with the former Kingdom of Scotland, operated under different institutions (at times as a \"de facto\" monarchy) and is known by historians as the Protectorate. In a British context, it is sometimes referred to as the \"Old Commonwealth\".\n\nThe Icelandic Commonwealth or the Icelandic Free State () was the state existing in Iceland between the establishment of the Althing in 930 and the pledge of fealty to the Norwegian king in 1262. It was initially established by a public consisting largely of recent immigrants from Norway who had fled the unification of that country under King Harald Fairhair.\n\nThe Commonwealth of the Philippines was the administrative body that governed the Philippines from 1935 to 1946, aside from a period of exile in the Second World War from 1942 to 1945 when Japan occupied the country. It replaced the Insular Government, a United States territorial government, and was established by the Tydings–McDuffie Act. The Commonwealth was designed as a transitional administration in preparation for the country's full achievement of independence, which was achieved in 1946.\n\n\"Republic\" is still an alternative translation of the traditional name of the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth. Wincenty Kadłubek (Vincent Kadlubo, 1160–1223) used for the first time the original Latin term \"res publica\" in the context of Poland in his \"Chronicles of the Kings and Princes of Poland\". The name was used officially for the confederal country formed by Poland and Lithuania 1569–1795.\n\nIt is also often referred as \"Nobles' Commonwealth\" (1505–1795, i.e., before the union). In the contemporary political doctrine of the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth, \"our state is a Republic (or Commonwealth) under the presidency of the King\". The Commonwealth introduced a doctrine of religious tolerance called Warsaw Confederation, had its own parliament \"Sejm\" (although elections were restricted to nobility and elected kings, who were bound to certain contracts \"Pacta conventa\" from the beginning of the reign).\n\n\"A commonwealth of good counsaile\" was the title of the 1607 English translation of the work of Wawrzyniec Grzymała Goślicki \"De optimo senatore\" that presented to English readers many of the ideas present in the political system of the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth.\n\nBetween 1914 and 1925, Catalonia was an autonomous region of Spain. Its government during that time was given the title \"mancomunidad\" (Catalan: \"mancomunitat\"), which is translated into English as \"commonwealth\". The Commonwealth of Catalonia had limited powers and was formed as a federation of the four Catalan provinces. A number of Catalan-language institutions were created during its existence.\n\nBetween 1838 and 1847, Liberia was officially known as the \"Commonwealth of Liberia\". It changed its name to the \"Republic of Liberia\" when it declared independence (and adopted a new constitution) in 1847.\n\n\"Commonwealth\" was first proposed as a term for a federation of the six Australian crown colonies at the 1891 constitutional convention in Sydney. Its adoption was initially controversial, as it was associated by some with the republicanism of Oliver Cromwell (see above), but it was retained in all subsequent drafts of the constitution. The term was finally incorporated into law in the \"Commonwealth of Australia Constitution Act 1901\", which established the federation. Australia operates under a federal system, in which power is divided between the federal (national) government and the state governments (the successors of the six colonies). So, in an Australian context, the term \"Commonwealth\" (capitalized) refers to the federal government, and \"Commonwealth of Australia\" is the official name of the country.\n\nThe Bahamas uses the official style \"Commonwealth of The Bahamas\".\n\nThe small Caribbean republic of Dominica has used the official style \"Commonwealth of Dominica\" since 1970.\n\nFour states of the United States officially designate themselves as \"commonwealths\". All four were part of Great Britain's possessions along the Atlantic coast of North America prior to the formation of the United States of America in 1776. As such, they share a strong influence of English common law in some of their laws and institutions. The four are:\n\nTwo organized but unincorporated U.S. territories are called commonwealths. The two are:\n\nThe Commonwealth of Nations—formerly the British Commonwealth—is a voluntary association or confederation of 53 independent sovereign states, most of which were once part of the British Empire. The Commonwealth's membership includes both republics and monarchies. The Head of the Commonwealth is Queen Elizabeth II, who also reigns as monarch directly in the 16 member states known as Commonwealth realms. \n\nThe Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS) is a loose alliance or confederation consisting of 10 of the 15 former Soviet Republics, the exceptions being Turkmenistan (a CIS associate member), Lithuania, Latvia, Estonia, Ukraine, and Georgia. Georgia left the CIS in August 2008 after a clash with Russia over South Ossetia. Its creation signalled the dissolution of the Soviet Union, its purpose being to \"allow a civilised divorce\" between the Soviet Republics. The CIS has developed as a forum by which the member-states can co-operate in economics, defence, and foreign policy.\n\nLabour MP Tony Benn sponsored a \"Commonwealth of Britain Bill\" several times between 1991 and 2001, intended to abolish the monarchy and establish a British republic. It never reached second reading.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "730450", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=730450", "title": "Deutsche Physik", "text": "Deutsche Physik\n\nDeutsche Physik (literally: \"German Physics\") or Aryan Physics () was a nationalist movement in the German physics community in the early 1930s. A pseudoscientific movement, it nonetheless won the support of many eminent physicists in Germany. The term was taken from the title of a 4-volume physics textbook by Nobel Laureate Philipp Lenard in the 1930s.\n\n\"Deutsche Physik\" was opposed to the work of Albert Einstein and other modern theoretically based physics, which was disparagingly labeled as \"Jewish physics\" ().\n\nThis movement began as an extension of a German nationalistic movement in the physics community which went back as far as World War I. On 25 August 1914, during the German invasion of Belgium, German troops used petrol to set fire to the library of the Katholieke Universiteit Leuven. The burning of the library led to a protest note which was signed by eight distinguished British scientists, namely William Bragg, William Crookes, Alexander Fleming, Horace Lamb, Oliver Lodge, William Ramsay, Lord Rayleigh, and J. J. Thomson. In 1915, this led to a counter-reaction in the form of an \"appeal\" formulated by Wilhelm Wien and addressed to German physicists and scientific publishers, which was signed by sixteen German physicists, including Arnold Sommerfeld and Johannes Stark. They claimed that German character had been misinterpreted and that attempts made over many years to reach an understanding between the two countries had obviously failed. Therefore, they opposed the use of the English language by German scientific authors, editors of books, and translators. A number of German physicists, including Max Planck and the especially passionate Philipp Lenard, a scientific rival of J. J. Thomson, had then signed further \"declarations\", so that gradually a \"war of the minds\" broke out. On the German side it was suggested to avoid an unnecessary use of English language in scientific texts (concerning, e.g., the renaming of German-discovered phenomena with perceived English-derived names, such as \"X-ray\" instead of \"Röntgen ray\"). It was stressed, however, that this measure should not be misunderstood as a rejection of British scientific thought, ideas and stimulations.\n\nAfter the war, the perceived affronts of the Treaty of Versailles kept some of these nationalistic feelings running high, especially in Lenard, who had already complained about England in a small pamphlet at the beginning of the war. When, on 26 January 1920, the former naval cadet Oltwig von Hirschfeld tried to assassinate German Finance minister Matthias Erzberger, Lenard sent Hirschfeld a telegram of congratulation. After the 1922 assassination of politician Walther Rathenau, the government ordered flags flown at half mast on the day of his funeral, but Lenard ignored the order at his institute in Heidelberg. Socialist students organized a demonstration against Lenard, who was taken into protective custody by state prosecutor Hugo Marx (a Jew). The sentiment displayed by Lenard was not unique to physics or physicists; the blend of nationalism and perceived affront from foreign and internal forces was a key reason for the popularity of the rising Nazi Party in the 1920s.\n\nDuring the early years of the twentieth century, Albert Einstein's Theory of Relativity caused bitter controversy within the worldwide physics community. There were many physicists, especially the \"old guard\", who were suspicious of the intuitive meanings of Einstein's theories. While the response to Einstein was based in part on his concepts being a radical break from earlier theories, there was also an anti-Jewish element to some of the criticism. The leading theoretician of the \"Deutsche Physik\" type of movement was Rudolf Tomaschek, who had re-edited the famous physics textbook \"Grimsehl's Lehrbuch der Physik\". In that book, which consists of several volumes, the Lorentz transformation was accepted, as well as quantum theory. However, Einstein's interpretation of the Lorentz transformation was not mentioned, and Einstein's name was completely ignored. Many classical physicists resented Einstein's dismissal of the notion of a luminiferous aether, which had been a mainstay of their work for the majority of their productive lives. They were not convinced by the empirical evidence for relativity. They felt that the measurements of the perihelion of Mercury and the null result of the Michelson–Morley experiment might be explained in other ways, and the results of the Eddington eclipse experiment were experimentally problematic enough to be dismissed as meaningless by the more devoted doubters. Many of them were very distinguished experimental physicists, and Lenard was himself a Nobel laureate in physics.\n\nWhen the Nazis entered the political scene, Lenard quickly attempted to ally himself with them, joining the party at an early stage. With another physics Nobel laureate, Johannes Stark, Lenard began a core campaign to label Einstein's Relativity as \"Jewish Physics\".\n\nLenard and Stark benefitted considerably from this Nazi support. Under the rallying cry that physics should be more \"German\" and \"Aryan,\" Lenard and Stark embarked on a Nazi-endorsed plan to replace physicists at German universities with \"Aryan Physicists.\" By 1935, though, this campaign was superseded by the Nuremberg Laws of 1935. There were no longer any Jewish physics professors in Germany, since under the Nuremberg Laws, Jews were not allowed to work in universities. Stark in particular also tried to install himself as the national authority on \"German\" physics under the principle of \"Gleichschaltung\" (literally, \"coordination\") applied to other professional disciplines. Under this Nazi-era paradigm, academic disciplines and professional fields followed a strictly linear hierarchy created along ideological lines.\n\nThe figureheads of \"Aryan Physics\" met with moderate success, but the support from the Nazi party was not as great as Lenard and Stark would have preferred. After a long period of harassment of quantum physicist Werner Heisenberg, including getting him labeled a \"White Jew\" in \"Das Schwarze Korps\", they began to fall from influence. Heisenberg was not only a pre-eminent physicist whom the Nazis realized they were better off with than without, however \"Jewish\" his theory might be in the eyes of Stark and Lenard, but Heisenberg had, as a young boy, attended school with SS chief Heinrich Himmler. In a historic moment, Heisenberg's mother rang Himmler's mother and asked her if she would please tell the SS to give \"Werner\" a break. After beginning a full character evaluation, which Heisenberg both instigated and passed, Himmler forbade further attack on the physicist. Heisenberg would later employ his \"Jewish physics,\" in the German project to develop nuclear fission for the purposes of nuclear weapons or nuclear energy use. Himmler promised Heisenberg that after Germany won the war, the SS would finance a physics institute to be directed by Heisenberg.\n\nLenard began to play less and less of a role, and soon Stark ran into even more difficulty, as other scientists and industrialists known for being exceptionally \"Aryan\" came to the defense of Relativity and quantum mechanics. As historian Mark Walker puts it, \"despite his best efforts, in the end his science was not accepted, supported, or used by the Third Reich. Stark spent a great deal of his time during the Third Reich fighting with bureaucrats within the National Socialist state. Most of the National Socialist leadership either never supported Lenard and Stark, or abandoned them in the course of the Third Reich.\"\n\nIt is occasionally put forth that there is a great irony in the Nazis' labeling modern physics as \"Jewish science\", since it was exactly modern physics—and the work of many European exiles—which was used to create the atomic bomb. Even if the German government had not embraced Lenard and Stark's ideas, the German antisemitic agenda was enough by itself to destroy the Jewish scientific community in Germany. Furthermore, the German nuclear energy project was never pursued with anywhere near the vigor of the Manhattan Project in the United States, and for that reason would likely not have succeeded in any case. The movement did not actually go as far as preventing the nuclear energy scientists from using quantum mechanics and relativity, but the education of young scientists and engineers suffered, not only from the loss of the Jewish scientists but also from political appointments and other interference. In 1938, Himmler wrote to Heisenberg that he could discuss modern physics but not mention Jewish scientists such as Bohr and Einstein in connection with it.\n\n\n"}

Her father, Trịnh Định Kính, was a successful businessman who owned the largest glass factory in French Indochina. She later stated that she grew eager to learn English because of her desire to watch her favorite films such as \"Gone with the Wind\" without subtitles. Her family provided her with private lessons in English. In 1955, when she was 24 years old, she joined the Voice of Vietnam radio station and was chosen to read the English language newscast aimed at listeners in Asia's English-speaking countries. One of her tutors and mentors at the station was Australian journalist Wilfred Burchett. At this time, she adopted the alias Thu Hương, meaning \"autumn fragrance\", as it was easier and shorter for her non-Vietnamese listeners. \n\nDuring the Vietnam War, Ngọ became famous among US soldiers for her propaganda broadcasts on Radio Hanoi. Her scripts were written by the North Vietnamese Army and were intended to frighten and shame the soldiers into leaving their posts. She made three broadcasts a day, reading a list of newly killed or imprisoned Americans, and playing popular US anti-war songs in an effort to incite feelings of nostalgia and homesickness, attempting to persuade US GIs that the US involvement in the Vietnam War was unjust and immoral. US Navy ships and personnel were also targeted in her broadcasts, with Ngọ reading out the names of crew members and saying that they were all going to die. She also received and played recorded messages from Americans who were against the war, saying later that she thought these messages were the most effective of all as \"Americans will believe their own people rather than the adversary\".\n\nA January 1966 Newspaper Enterprise Association article by Tom Tiede described the program:\n\nHannah's shows are invariably the same. After the news is an editorial denouncing U.S. escalation of the war. Then a recording by an Asian soprano who sounds as if she's having her ears pierced. Then, Mailbag Time ('write us for the truth, friends').\n\nOne of her typical broadcasts began as follows:\n\nHow are you, GI Joe? It seems to me that most of you are poorly informed about the going of the war, to say nothing about a correct explanation of your presence over here. Nothing is more confused than to be ordered into a war to die or to be maimed for life without the faintest idea of what's going on.\n\nFew if any desertions are thought to have happened because of her propaganda work and the soldiers \"hooted at her scare tactics\". They were sometimes impressed, however, when she mentioned the correct location of their unit (when they would \"give a toast to her and throw beer cans at the radio\"), named US casualties and welcomed Navy ships into port with their correct arrival details and crew members' names. There were exaggerated legends of her omniscience, with rumors that she would give clues about everything from specific future North Vietnamese attacks to soldiers' girlfriends cheating on them at home. In reality, most of her information came from publications such as the US military newspaper, \"Stars and Stripes\".\n\nIt has been claimed that US forces in Vietnam distrusted the U.S. Armed Forces Radio bulletins, and listened to Ngọ's bulletins for information from the U.S. According to war correspondent Don North: \n\nBy zapping the truth through an ostrich-like policy of censorship, deletions, and exaggerations U.S. Armed Forces Radio lost the trust of many GIs when they were most isolated and vulnerable to enemy propaganda. It wasn't that Hanoi Hannah always told the truth - she didn't. But she was most effective when she did tell the truth and US Armed Forces Radio was fudging it.\n\nNgọ's broadcasts ran for a total of 8 years, with her final broadcasts airing in 1973, when most of the American forces were leaving. In interviews in later years, she consistently stated that she agreed with the purpose of the scripts and never deviated from them; she believed that America should not have sent troops to Vietnam and should have allowed the country to resolve its situation itself.\n\nIn 1975, after the war, Ngọ moved to Saigon with her husband. She was offered a job on HCMC Television, but she chose to stay at home and take care of her husband, who had suffered a stroke. She died in Ho Chi Minh City on 30 September 2016 at the age of 85.\n\n\n \n"}

{"id": "39617264", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=39617264", "title": "Holacracy", "text": "Holacracy\n\nHolacracy is a method of decentralized management and organizational governance, in which authority and decision-making are distributed throughout a holarchy of self-organizing teams rather than being vested in a management hierarchy. Holacracy has been adopted by for-profit and non-profit organizations in several countries.\n\nThe Holacracy system was developed at Ternary Software, an Exton, Pennsylvania company that was noted for experimenting with more democratic forms of organizational governance. Ternary founder Brian Robertson distilled the company's best practices into an organizational system that became known as Holacracy in 2007. Robertson later developed the \"Holacracy Constitution\", which lays out the core principles and practices of the system. In June 2015, he released the book \"Holacracy: The New Management System for a Rapidly Changing World,\" that details and explains his practices.\n\nThe term holacracy is derived from the term holarchy, coined by Arthur Koestler in his 1967 book \"The Ghost in the Machine\". A holarchy is composed of holons (Greek: ὅλον, holon neuter form of ὅλος, holos \"whole\") or units that are autonomous and self-reliant, but also dependent on the greater whole of which they are part. Thus a holarchy is a hierarchy of self-regulating holons that function both as autonomous wholes and as dependent parts.\n\nHolacracy is one of several systems of flat organization. It has been compared to sociocracy, a system of governance developed in the second half of the 20th century. Sociocracy had a significant early influence during the incubation of Holacracy, though Holacracy has increasingly differentiated away from it since then. Sociocracy particularly inspired the development of the circle structure and governance processes (described in more detail later) within Holacracy. Holacracy is designed for organizations and fundamentally differentiates the roles of the organization from the people working in it.\n\nIn its emphasis on iterative governance, adaptive processes, and self-organization, . Holacracy is highly compatible with stakeholder theory as its board structure allows for multiple stakeholders to be represented in the governance of an organization and for multiple organizations with shared interests to be linked at the governance level.\n\nThe building blocks of Holacracy's organizational structure are roles. Holacracy distinguishes between roles and the people who fill them, as one individual can hold multiple roles at any given time. A role is not a job description; its definition follows a clear format including a name, a purpose, optional \"domains\" to control, and accountabilities, which are ongoing activities to perform. Roles are defined by each circle —or team— via a collective governance process, and are updated regularly in order to adapt to the ever-evolving needs of the organization.\n\nHolacracy structures the various roles in an organization in a system of self-organizing (but not self-directed) circles. Circles are organized hierarchically, and each circle is assigned a clear purpose and accountabilities by its broader circle. However, each circle has the authority to self-organize internally to best achieve its goals. Circles conduct their own governance meetings, assign members to fill roles, and take responsibility for carrying out work within their domain of authority. Circles are connected by two roles known as \"lead link\" and \"rep link\", which sit in the meetings of both their circle and the broader circle to ensure alignment with the broader organization’s mission and strategy.\n\nEach circle uses a defined governance process to create and regularly update its own roles and policies. Holacracy specifies a structured process known as \"integrative decision making\" for proposing changes in governance and amending or objecting to proposals. This is not a consensus-based system, not even a consent-based system, but one that integrates relevant input from all parties and ensures that the proposed changes and objections to those changes are anchored in the roles' needs (and through them, the organization's needs), rather than people's preferences or ego.\n\nHolacracy specifies processes for aligning teams around operational needs, and requires that each member of a circle fulfill certain duties in order to work efficiently and effectively together. In contrast to the governance process, which is collective and integrative, each member filling a role has a lot of autonomy and authority to make decisions on how to best achieve his or her goals. Some have described the authority paradigm in Holacracy as completely opposite to the one of the traditional management hierarchy; instead of needing permission to act or innovate, Holacracy gives blanket authority to take any action needed to perform the work of the roles, unless it is restricted via policies in governance or it involves spending some assets of the organization (money, intellectual property, etc.) Holacracy is thus highly biased toward action and innovation: it defaults to autonomy and freedom, then uses internal processes to limit that autonomy when its use in a specific way turns out to be detrimental.\n\nHolacracy specifies a tactical meeting process that every circle goes through usually on a weekly basis. This process includes different phases to report on relevant data, share updates on projects, and open discussions where any circle member can add to the agenda. A particular feature of this last phase, known as \"triage\", is to focus discussions on the concrete next steps needed by the individual who added the agenda item to address his or her issue. The intention is to avoid large, unproductive discussions dominated by the louder voices.\n\nIn the U.S., for-profit and not-for-profit organizations have adopted and practiced Holacracy. Examples include Zappos, the David Allen Company, Precision Nutrition, and nonprofit Conscious Capitalism. Medium used Holacracy for several years before abandoning it in 2016.\n\nHolacracy is claimed to increase agility, efficiency, transparency, innovation and accountability within an organization. The approach encourages individual team members to take initiative and gives them a process in which their concerns or ideas can be addressed. The system of distributed authority reduces the burden on leaders to make every decision.\n\nAccording to Zappos's CEO Tony Hsieh, Holacracy makes individuals more responsible for their own thoughts and actions.\n\nSteve Denning warned against viewing Holacracy as a panacea, claiming that instead of removing hierarchy, decisions are funneled down from circle to circle in a clear hierarchy, with each subsequent circle knowing less about the big picture than the one above. He also claimed that the rules and procedures laid out in the founding documents of Holacracy such as Robertson's originating article are very detailed and focused on \"administrivia.\" Lastly, Denning added that the voice of the customer was missing from the Holacracy model, concluding that for agile and customer-focused companies such as Zappos, Holacracy is a way to add administrative rigor, but that Holacracy would not necessarily work well in an organization that did not already have agility and passion for the customer. HolacracyOne partner Olivier Compagne replied to those criticisms on the company's blog, claiming that Denning's criticisms misunderstand Holacracy, and explaining how the rules of Holacracy address or avoid those alleged pitfalls.\n\nIn moving away from Holacracy, \"Medium\" noted that \"for larger initiatives, which require coordination across functions, it can be time-consuming and divisive to gain alignment\" and that Medium believed that \"the act of codifying responsibilities in explicit detail hindered a proactive attitude and sense of communal ownership\". They also noted that the inaccurate media coverage of Holacracy created a challenge for recruitment.\n\nAt Zappos, about 14% of the company left voluntarily in 2015 in a deliberate attempt by Zappos to have only retain employees who believed in holacracy.\n\nOther criticisms include a \"one-size-fits-all\" approach, layers of bureaucracy and more psychological weight.\n\nThe name Holacracy is a registered trademark of HolacracyOne LLC.

{"id": "330536", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=330536", "title": "Israel Border Police", "text": "Israel Border Police\n\nThe Israel Border Police (, \"Mišmar Ha-Gvul\") is the gendarmerie and border security branch of the Israel National Police. It is also commonly known by its Hebrew abbreviation Magav (), meaning border guard; its members are colloquially known as \"Magavnikim\" (). Border Guard is often used as the official name of the Israel Border Police in English. While its main task is securing Israel's borders, it has also been deployed in assisting the Israel Defense Forces, and for counter-terrorism and law enforcement operations in the West Bank, as well as in Jerusalem.\n\nThe Israeli Border Police is renowned for including a large number of soldiers from minority backgrounds, being a particularly popular choice with Druze recruits, but also includes many soldiers from Circassian, Arab Christian and Bedouin background.\n\nThe Border Police was founded as the Frontier Corps (, \"Heil HaSfar\"), a gendarmerie under the IDF in 1949 with the task of providing security in rural areas and along the borders. In the course of the following years, it was gradually transferred to the command of the Police and became the Border Police. During these years, it secured new settlements and countered infiltration of Palestinian Fedayeen, especially from Egypt and Jordan.\n\nDuring the 1956 Suez War, the Border Police was involved in the Kafr Qasim massacre. On the second day of the war, a curfew was imposed on the Israeli Arab village. Villagers who had worked in the village fields and were apparently unaware of the curfew were shot as they returned to the village, resulting in 49 dead. This event raised a strong protest in the Israeli public and resulted in a landmark Supreme Court ruling on the obligation of soldiers to disobey manifestly illegal orders.\n\nDuring the 1967 Six-Day War, the Border Police took part in the fighting alongside the IDF. Following the war, it was deployed in the West Bank and Gaza Strip and charged with maintaining law and order as part of the military administration. Since then, a significant portion of the Border Police's activity has been in these territories, especially during the years of the First Intifada and the Second (al-Aqsa) Intifada.\n\nIn 1974, the counter-terror unit Yamam was established.\n\nIn the 2000 October Riots, the Border Police were used as the main branch of the treatment in the events. During the Second Intifada, the Border Police took a large part in the security activity.\n\nIn 2005, the Border Police participated in the implementation of the Israeli disengagement from Gaza.\n\nThe Border Police heaviest area of operation is the city of Jerusalem. Virtually all \"soldiers\" that can be seen patrolling the streets of Jerusalem are actually Border Guard Police officers. Approximately 20% of all Border Guard personnel in the country are located in Jerusalem alone. Besides Jerusalem MAGAV also provides security, conducts military operations, raids and arrests on Palestinian people in cities like Jenin, Nablus, Jericho, Qalqilya, Tulkarm, Ramallah and Hebron.\n\nThe total number of Border Guards is believed to be about 6,000 soldiers and officers. \n\nThe Israeli Border Police is renowned for including a large number of soldiers from minority backgrounds, being a particularly popular choice with Druze recruits, but also includes many soldiers from Circassian, Arab Christian and Bedouin background.\n\nThe Border Police is composed of professional officers on payroll and field policemen redirected from the IDF (men and women at the age of 18 can choose to serve in the Border Police instead of the IDF, serving 3 years as a border policeman is equal to 3 years as an IDF soldier). All border policemen receive combat training and in addition are also trained for CT (counter-terrorism), riot control and policework. Excellent policemen can specialize in some profession and receive special training to become snipers, buggie-drivers, dog operators, bomb squad, etc.\n\nBecause of their combat training, border policemen are employed in unique areas, where there are greater risks for riots, violence and even terror. They serve mainly in the countryside, in Arab villages and towns (along with the regular police), near the borders and in the West Bank.\n\nThe Border Police is also responsible for security of rural settlements inside Israel with its Rural Police (Hebrew: שיטור כפרי, \"shitur kafri\") units and community security coordinators (Hebrew: רב\"ש, \"rabash\"). Rural policemen are full-time professional officers and security coordinators are a mixture of full-time and volunteer officers.\n\nThe \"Border Police Memorial and Heritage Center\" is located in the western Carmel mountains near Zomet Iron at road 65.\n\nThe Border Police has four Special forces units:\n\nThe Yamam (counter-terror and hostage rescue unit) record includes the capture of a terrorist group hidden in the Arab town of Tayibe, the rescue of Eliyahu Goral, the killing of the Hamas head in Hebron and Abbedullah Qawasameh.\n\nThe Yamas are the counter-terror undercover unit.\n\nThe Yamas are often expected to carry out complex missions with little or no preparation, often involving daylight raids in volatile areas. They do not follow regular military or police command structure and answer directly to the Shabak. Their existence has until recently been denied by the IDF.\n\n\nThe Border Guard also deploys a large number of volunteer servicemen. These volunteer Border Guard members enlist as volunteers and serve in regular Border Guard units. The Border Guard relies on the volunteer soldiers in order to reinforce their manpower and help maintain the country's heavy security needs. The volunteer Border Guard are given special attention in sensitive places like Jerusalem where security threats are the highest and at times can double or even triple the manpower of full-time security forces in a given area.\n\nMany of these special Border Guard volunteers are Jewish immigrants that have immigrated to Israel from all over the world from places like the United States, United Kingdom, Canada, Australia, Italy, France, Germany, South Africa, South America, and the former Soviet Union, etc.\n\nThe volunteer Border Guard members leave behind jobs and families on a regular basis in order to serve in this special combat unit. Some come from cities like Beit Shemesh, Ofrah, Ashkelon, Ra'anana and even Haifa to serve in the Border Guard. The volunteers receive no pay for serving in the Border Guard units and serve in the Border Guard in their off work hours.\n\nBelow is a list of current and former Border Police Commanders\n\n\nThe ranks in the Border Police are the same as those of the Israel Police and are similarly sworn in: the ranks of police officers and junior officers on the shirt collar, ranks of officers and senior officers on the cover. However in field uniforms Border Police officers wear rank insignia on a green background worn on epaulets on top of both shoulders or on green epaulets. Border Police branch insignia is worn on the cap or beret. Enlisted grades wear rank insignia on the sleeve, halfway between the shoulder and the elbow. The Border Police British Army style insignia are white with blue interwoven threads backed with the appropriate corps color.\n\nThe Border has several types of uniforms:\n\n\nThe first two resemble each other but the Madei Alef is made of higher quality materials in grey while the madei bet is in grey drab.\n\n\nThe service uniform for all Border Police personnel is grey. The uniforms consist of a two-pocket shirt, plain or combat trousers, sweater, jacket or blouse, and shoes or boots. The grey fatigues are the same for winter and summer and heavy winter gear is issued as needed. Women's dress parallels the men's but may substitute a skirt for the trousers.\n\nHeadgear included a service cap for dress and semi-dress and a field cap or bush hat worn with fatigues. Border Police personnel generally wear green beretsin lieu of the service cap.\n\nSome units have small variations in their uniforms such as certain Security and Tactical units in Jerusalem who wear the standard IDF olive fatigues.\n\nThe primary Border Police weapons are the CAR-15 and M-16 rifles. The Border Police also use standard IDF equipment such as vests and helmets. some of which are attached to the M-203 grenade launcher . Police officers and myself, as well as special units of fighters pistols type Glock 17 , Glock 19 , Jericho or FN HP. Some units, such as Jerusalem Patrol unit carrying a Beretta M9-22LR .22LR pistol. Special units use a variety of other individual and individual weapons, (Ruger S22), sniper rifles, submachine guns and Shotguns.\n\nThe Border Police extensively use riot dispersal means such as batons and shields, tear gas canisters and stun grenades, also rubber bullets and water cannon.\n\nThe Border Police also use Sufa, Carkal, Dawid and a variety of patrol cars and vehicles, and several units in the Border Police use motorcycles.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "231378", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=231378", "title": "John Birch Society", "text": "John Birch Society\n\nThe John Birch Society (JBS) is a self-described conservative advocacy group supporting anti-communism and limited government. It has been described as a radical right and far-right organization.\n\nBusinessman and founder Robert W. Welch, Jr. (1899–1985) developed an organizational infrastructure in 1958 of chapters nationwide. Its main activity in the 1960s, said Rick Perlstein, \"comprised monthly meetings to watch a film by Welch, followed by writing postcards or letters to government officials linking specific policies to the Communist menace\". After an early rise in membership and influence, efforts by those such as conservative William F. Buckley, Jr. and \"National Review\" led the JBS to be identified as a fringe element of the conservative movement, mostly in fear of the radicalization of the American right.\n\nOriginally based in Belmont, Massachusetts, it is now headquartered in Appleton, Wisconsin, with local chapters throughout the United States. The organization owns American Opinion Publishing, which publishes \"The New American\".\n\nThe organization supports limited government and opposes wealth redistribution and economic interventionism. It opposes collectivism, totalitarianism, anarchism and communism. It opposes socialism as well, which it asserts is infiltrating U.S. governmental administration. In a 1983 edition of the political-debate television program \"Crossfire\", Congressman Larry McDonald (a conservative Democrat from Georgia), then the society’s newly appointed president, characterized it as belonging to the Old Right rather than the New Right.\n\nThe society opposed the 1960s civil rights movement and claimed the movement had Communists in important positions. In the latter half of 1965, the JBS produced a flyer titled \"What's Wrong With Civil Rights?\", which was used as a newspaper advertisement. In the piece, one of the answers was: \"For the civil rights movement in the United States, with all of its growing agitation and riots and bitterness, and insidious steps towards the appearance of a civil war, has not been \"infiltrated\" by the Communists, as you now frequently hear. It has been deliberately and almost wholly \"created\" by the Communists patiently building up to this present stage for more than forty years.\" The society opposed the Civil Rights Act of 1964, claiming it violated the Tenth Amendment to the United States Constitution and overstepped individual states' rights to enact laws regarding civil rights. The society also opposed the Equal Rights Amendment. The society opposes \"one world government\", and it has an immigration reduction view on immigration reform. It opposes the United Nations, the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA), the Central America Free Trade Agreement (CAFTA), the Free Trade Area of the Americas (FTAA), and other free trade agreements. It argues the U.S. Constitution has been devalued in favor of political and economic globalization, and that this alleged trend is not accidental. It cited the existence of the former Security and Prosperity Partnership as evidence of a push towards a North American Union.\n\nThe society has been described as \"ultraconservative\", \"far right\", and \"extremist\". Other sources consider the society part of the patriot movement. The Southern Poverty Law Center, for example, lists the society as a 'Patriot' group, a group that \"advocate[s] or adhere[s] to extreme antigovernment doctrines\".\n\nThe society was established in Indianapolis, Indiana, on December 9, 1958, by a group of 12 led by Robert W. Welch, Jr., a retired candy manufacturer from Belmont, Massachusetts. Welch named the new organization after John Birch, an American Baptist missionary and military intelligence officer who was shot and killed by communist forces in China in August 1945, shortly after the conclusion of World War II. Welch claimed that Birch was an unknown but dedicated anti-communist, and the first American casualty of the Cold War. Jimmy Doolittle, who met Birch after bailing out over China following the Tokyo Raid, said in his autobiography that he was certain that Birch \"would not have approved\" of that particular use of his name.\n\nHarry Lynde Bradley, co-founder of the Allen Bradley Company and the Lynde and Harry Bradley Foundation, Fred C. Koch, founder of Koch Industries and Robert Waring Stoddard, President of Wyman-Gordon, a major industrial enterprise, were among the founding members. Another was Revilo P. Oliver, a University of Illinois professor who was later expelled from the Society and helped found the National Alliance. A transcript of Welch's two-day presentation at the founding meeting was published as \"The Blue Book of the John Birch Society,\" and became a cornerstone of its beliefs, with each new member receiving a copy. According to Welch, \"both the U.S. and Soviet governments are controlled by the same furtive conspiratorial cabal of internationalists, greedy bankers, and corrupt politicians. If left unexposed, the traitors inside the U.S. government would betray the country's sovereignty to the United Nations for a collectivist New World Order, managed by a 'one-world socialist government. Welch saw collectivism as the main threat to western culture, and American liberals as \"secret communist traitors\" who provided cover for the gradual process of collectivism, with the ultimate goal of replacing the nations of western civilization with a one-world socialist government. \"There are many stages of welfarism, socialism, and collectivism in general,\" he wrote, \"but Communism is the ultimate state of them all, and they all lead inevitably in that direction.\"\n\nThe society's activities include distribution of literature, pamphlets, magazines, videos and other material while sponsoring a Speaker's Bureau, which invites \"speakers who are keenly aware of the motivations that drive political policy\". One of the first public activities of the society was a \"Get US Out!\" (of membership in the UN) campaign, which claimed in 1959 that the \"Real nature of [the] UN is to build a One World Government\". In 1960, Welch advised JBS members to: \"Join your local P.T.A. at the beginning of the school year, get your conservative friends to do likewise, and go to work to take it over.\" \"One Man's Opinion\", a magazine launched by Welch in 1956, was renamed \"American Opinion,\" and became the society's official publication. The society publishes \"The New American\", a biweekly magazine.\n\nBy March 1961 the society had 60,000 to 100,000 members and, according to Welch, \"a staff of 28 people in the Home Office; about 30 Coordinators (or Major Coordinators) in the field, who are fully paid as to salary and expenses; and about 100 Coordinators (or Section Leaders as they are called in some areas), who work on a volunteer basis as to all or part of their salary, or expenses, or both\". According to Political Research Associates (a non-profit research group that investigates the far right), the society \"pioneered grassroots lobbying, combining educational meetings, petition drives and letter-writing campaigns. One early campaign against the second summit between the United States and the Soviet Union generated over 600,000 postcards and letters, according to the society. In that same year Welch offered $2,300 in prizes to college students for the best essays on \"grounds of impeachment\" of Chief Justice Warren, a prime target of ultra-conservatives. A June 1964 society campaign to oppose Xerox corporate sponsorship of TV programs favorable to the UN produced 51,279 letters from 12,785 individuals.\"\n\nIn 1962, William F. Buckley, Jr., editor of the main conservative magazine, the \"National Review\", denounced Welch and the John Birch Society as \"far removed from common sense\" and urged the GOP to purge itself of Welch's influence.\n\nIn the late 1960s Welch insisted that the Johnson administration's fight against communism in Vietnam was part of a communist plot aimed at taking over the United States. Welch demanded that the United States get out of Vietnam, thus aligning the Society with the left. The society opposed water fluoridation, which it called \"mass medicine\".\nThe JBS was moderately active in the 1960s with numerous chapters, but rarely engaged in coalition building with other conservatives. It was rejected by most conservatives because of Welch's conspiracy theories. The philosopher Ayn Rand said in a 1964 \"Playboy\" interview, \"I consider the Birch Society futile, because they are not for capitalism but merely against communism ... I gather they believe that the disastrous state of today's world is caused by a communist conspiracy. This is childishly naïve and superficial. No country can be destroyed by a mere conspiracy, it can be destroyed only by ideas.\"\n\nFormer Eisenhower cabinet member Ezra Taft Benson—a leading Mormon—spoke in favor of the John Birch Society, but in January 1963 the LDS church issued a statement distancing itself from the Society. Antisemitic, racist, anti-Mormon, anti-Masonic groups criticized the organization's acceptance of Jews, non-whites, Masons, and Mormons as members. These opponents accused Welch of harboring feminist, ecumenical, and evolutionary ideas. Welch rejected these accusations by his detractors: \"All we are interested in here is opposing the advance of the Communists, and eventually destroying the whole Communist conspiracy, so that Jews and Christians alike, and Mohammedans and Buddhists, can again have a decent world in which to live.\"\n\nIn 1964 Welch favored Barry Goldwater for the Republican presidential nomination, but the membership split, with two-thirds supporting Goldwater and one-third supporting Richard Nixon, who did not run. A number of Birch members and their allies were Goldwater supporters in 1964 and some were delegates at the 1964 Republican National Convention.\n\nIn April 1966, a \"New York Times\" article on New Jersey and the society voiced—in part—a concern for \"the increasing tempo of radical right attacks on local government, libraries, school boards, parent-teacher associations, mental health programs, the Republican Party and, most recently, the ecumenical movement.\" It then characterized the society as \"by far the most successful and 'respectable' radical right organization in the country. It operates alone or in support of other extremist organizations whose major preoccupation, like that of the Birchers, is the internal Communist conspiracy in the United States.\"\n\nWelch wrote in a widely circulated statement, \"The Politician,\" \"Could Eisenhower really be simply a smart politician, entirely without principles and hungry for glory, who is only the tool of the Communists? The answer is yes.\" He went on. \"With regard to ... Eisenhower, it is difficult to avoid raising the question of deliberate treason.\"\n\nThe controversial paragraph was removed before final publication of \"The Politician\".\n\nThe sensationalism of Welch's charges against Eisenhower prompted several conservatives and Republicans, most prominently Goldwater and the intellectuals of William F. Buckley's circle, to renounce outright or quietly shun the group. Buckley, an early friend and admirer of Welch, regarded his accusations against Eisenhower as \"paranoid and idiotic libels\" and attempted unsuccessfully to purge Welch from the Birch Society. From then on Buckley, who was editor of \"National Review\", became the leading intellectual spokesman and organizer of the anti-Bircher conservatives. Buckley's biographer John B. Judis wrote that \"Buckley was beginning to worry that with the John Birch Society growing so rapidly, the right-wing upsurge in the country would take an ugly, even Fascist turn rather than leading toward the kind of conservatism \"National Review\" had promoted.\"\n\nThe booklet found support from Ezra Taft Benson, Eisenhower's Secretary of Agriculture who later became the 13th President of the LDS Church. In a letter to his friend FBI chief J. Edgar Hoover, Benson asked \"how can a man [Eisenhower] who seems to be so strong for Christian principles and base American concepts be so effectively used as a tool to serve the communist conspiracy?\" Benson privately fought to prevent the bureau from condemning the JBS, which prompted Hoover to distance himself from Benson. At one point in 1971 Hoover directed his staff to lie to Benson to avoid having to meet with him about the issue.\n\nThe society was at the center of a free-speech law case in the 1970s, after \"American Opinion\" accused a Chicago lawyer, Elmer Gertz, who was representing the family of a young man killed by a police officer, of being part of a Communist conspiracy to merge all police agencies in the country into one large force. The resulting libel suit, \"Gertz v. Robert Welch, Inc.\", reached the United States Supreme Court, which held that a state may allow a private figure such as Gertz to recover actual damages from a media defendant without proving malice, but that a public figure does have to prove actual malice, according to the standard laid out in \"New York Times Co. v. Sullivan\", in order to recover presumed damages or punitive damages. The court ordered a retrial in which Gertz prevailed.\n\nKey society causes of the 1970s included opposition to both the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) and to the establishment of diplomatic ties with the People's Republic of China. The society claimed in 1973 that the regime of Mao Zedong had murdered 64 million Chinese as of that year and that it was the primary supplier of illicit heroin into the United States. This led to bumper stickers showing a pair of scissors cutting a hypodermic needle in half accompanied by the slogan \"Cut The Red China Connection\". The society also was opposed to transferring control of the Panama Canal from American to Panamanian sovereignty.\n\nThe society was organized into local chapters during this period. Ernest Brosang, a New Jersey regional coordinator, claimed that it was virtually impossible for opponents of the society to penetrate its policy-making levels, thereby protecting it from \"anti-American\" takeover attempts. Its activities included the distribution of literature critical of civil rights legislation, warnings over the influence of the United Nations, and the release of petitions to impeach United States Supreme Court Justice Earl Warren. To spread their message, members held showings of documentary films and operated initiatives such as \"Let Freedom Ring\", a nationwide network of recorded telephone messages.\n\nBy the time of Welch's death in 1985, the society's membership and influence had dramatically declined. The society continues to press for an end to United States membership in the United Nations. As evidence of the effectiveness of JBS efforts, the society points to the Utah State Legislature's failed resolution calling for United States withdrawal, as well as the actions of several other states where the Society's membership has been active. Since its founding, the society has repeatedly opposed United States military intervention overseas, although it strongly supports the American military. It has issued calls to \"Bring Our Troops Home\" in every conflict since its founding, including Vietnam. The society also has a national speakers' committee called American Opinion Speakers Bureau (AOSB) and an anti-tax committee called TRIM (Tax Reform IMmediately).\n\nThe second head of the Society was Congressman Larry McDonald (D) from Georgia, who was killed on September 1, 1983, when airliner KAL 007 was shot down by a Soviet interceptor.\n\nWilliam P. Hoar has been active as a writer for the Society. He is noted for very strong attacks on mainstream politicians from Franklin D. Roosevelt to George W. Bush. He publishes regularly in \"The New American\" and its predecessor \"American Opinion.\" He coauthored \"The Clinton Clique\" with Larry Abraham alleging that Clinton was part of the Anglo-American conspiracy supposedly ruled through the Council on Foreign Relations and the Trilateral Commission. The Birch Society publications arm, \"Western Islands\" published his \"Architects of Conspiracy: An Intriguing History\" (1984) and Huntington House Publishers published his \"Handouts and Pickpockets: Our Government Gone Berserk\" (1996).\n\nThe Society has been active in supporting the auditing of, and aims to eventually dismantle, the Federal Reserve System. The JBS holds that the United States Constitution gives only Congress the ability to coin money, and does not permit it to delegate this power, or to transform the dollar into a fiat currency not backed by gold or silver.\n\nThe JBS was a co-sponsor of the 2010 Conservative Political Action Conference, ending its decades-long exile from the mainstream conservative movement. In 2012, the American Conservative Union board voted to not invite the JBS to the conference.\n\nJBS is opposed to modern-day efforts to call a convention to propose amendments to the United States Constitution.\n\nAlthough membership numbers are kept private, the JBS has reported a resurgence of members during the Trump administration, specifically in Texas. The organization's goals in Texas include opposition to the UN's Agenda 21 based on a conspiracy theory that it will \"establish control over all human activity\", and opposition to a bill that would allow undocumented migrants to pay in-state tuition for Texas state colleges.\n\nJeet Heer, in \"The New Republic\", has said that while the organization's influence peaked in the 1970s, its legacy of conspiracy theories and \"overt anti-Semitism\" has become a dominant strain in the conservative movement.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

He was made a cardinal in 2006, and has been outspoken on issues regarding human rights, political freedom, and religious liberty, often attracting criticism from the Communist Party of China. He retired on 15 April 2009.\n\nJoseph Zen was born in Shanghai to Catholic parents, Vincent Zen and Margaret Tseu. He studied in a church school during the Second Sino-Japanese War, but was sent to an abbey after his father suffered a stroke.\n\nZen fled to Hong Kong from Shanghai to escape Communist rule at the end of the Chinese Civil War. After entering the Salesians at the Hong Kong novitiate, he was ordained to the priesthood on 11 February 1961 by Cardinal Maurilio Fossati. Zen obtained a licentiate in theology (1961) and a doctorate in philosophy (1964) from the Salesian Pontifical University in Rome. After 1973, he taught in the Holy Spirit Seminary College of Hong Kong – 1976 to 1978 of Macao Salesian School (Instituto Salesiano) （澳門慈幼中學） as principal. In 1978 he became the Provincial Superior of Salesians (which includes mainland China, Hong Kong, Macau, and Taiwan), then resigned in 1983. He was a lecturer in the seminaries in China, centres of studies acknowledged by the Communist party, between 1989 and 1996. He was appointed the coadjutor Bishop of Hong Kong in 1996 by Pope John Paul II.\n\nAfter he succeeded as Bishop of Hong Kong on 23 September 2002, he led the Diocese in voicing reservations about the proposed anti-subversion laws, required under Article 23 of the Basic Law. He was worried that these laws, if enacted without a thorough consultation process including a white paper, could easily lead to future violations of basic civil rights.\n\nOn 1 July 2003, he took part in a prayer gathering at Victoria Park before the 1 July March began. Many Christians, including Catholics and those of other denominations, attended the demonstration.\n\nOn 3 June 2004, the diocese held a praying activity called \"Democratize China\" (民主中國). Zen said that Hong Kong was suffering from a \"bloodless June Fourth Massacre\" without guns and tanks. He was criticized by the Financial Minister of PRC.\n\nOn 1 July 2004, Zen attended a prayer gathering at Victoria Park before the second 1 July March, but did not take part in the demonstration. Still, many Catholics joined thousands of other citizens in the anti-government march.\n\nOn 3 November 2005, after returning from Vatican City, he said that the people of Hong Kong should be allowed to decide whether or not they wanted proposed constitutional reforms; he also said that the Government should conduct a \"territory-wide public opinion survey\" to allow the people to decide whether or not they wanted the constitutional reform package it was proposing. He was then known as the 'Voice' of Hong Kong because he successfully made six pan-democrats that tried to support the motion of the Government to announce opposition to the motion. He was openly criticized by Chief Secretary Rafael Hui after the defeat of the political reform package.\n\nCardinal Zen attended the 4 June 2006 Prayer gathering in memory of the victims of the 1989 massacre. He asked the Chinese government to let the Chinese people freely discuss the 1989 Tiananmen Square protests.\n\nZen also led the 1 July Protest in 2007.\n\nZen has been described as the \"new conscience of Hong Kong\" for his defence of human rights, political freedom, and religious liberty in the face of criticism from China's communist government. He has called the Chinese crackdown on pro-democracy protesters in Tiananmen Square \"a big mistake,\" and called on the government to \"tell the truth\" about those events. He was also an opponent of Hong Kong Basic Law Article 23, a since-shelved national security bill, which in 2003 prompted an anti-government protest by half a million people. Zen is a vocal proponent of a push for universal suffrage in Hong Kong, telling his flock in a 2005 homily that \"a path will appear when enough people walk on it.\" He has publicly called on officials in Hong Kong to support the aspirations of the people, rather than functioning as spokespersons for the central government in Beijing. At a personal level, he is described by John L. Allen Jr., a Vatican watcher, as \"a gracious, humble man, a moderate on most issues\".\n\nZen was named the \"Person of the Year 2002\" by \"Apple Daily\".\n\nOn 18 September 2005, he told Hong Kong newspaper \"Apple Daily\" reporters that he was willing to retire in January 2007. He also said that he wanted to be a teacher in either mainland China or in Africa, as there are teachers shortage in Africa. Democratic Party ex-chairman Martin Lee, also a Roman Catholic, stated that because Zen was still healthy for his age, the Pope may request him to stay in his position. Legislative Council member Audrey Eu praised Zen for being braver than other religious leaders in Hong Kong in sharing his political views and also because \"he carried out his ideas of fairness, equitableness, and philanthropy via actual efforts\". On the other hand, some conservatives inside the church speculated that the strained relationship between Beijing and the Holy See will become more relaxed if Zen retires. Nonetheless, Zen wrote a letter to the Pope on 13 January 2006 and stated that he did want to retire from his position, though not because of his age. On 15 April 2009 Pope Benedict accepted Cardinal Zen's resignation and John Tong Hon became the Bishop of the diocese.\n\nFrom 22 October 2011 for three days Cardinal Zen went on hunger strike which was undertaken as an act of protest against losing a long-standing legal battle with the Hong Kong government over how aided schools should be run. He later wrote about his experiences in an open letter.\n\nOn 22 February 2006, the Vatican announced that Zen would be elevated to the College of Cardinals by Pope Benedict XVI in the consistory on 24 March 2006. Zen, who was created Cardinal-Priest of Santa Maria Madre del Redentore a Tor Bella Monaca, saw his elevation as indication of how much the Pope values the Church in China. He was named a member of the Congregation for Divine Worship and the Discipline of the Sacraments.\n\nBishop Zen's elevation was welcomed by Catholics in Hong Kong as it was seen as a recognition of the bishop's stance on social justice and as an honour for the church in Hong Kong. Vicar General Rev. Dominic Chan Chi-ming said that it would be an honour to have a cardinal to once again head the diocese. Rev. Louis Ha Ke-loon said it shows that the Pope feels that Bishop Zen should speak out. Democrat legislator Martin Lee added that it was good news because no matter whether he is a bishop or a cardinal, as a religious leader Zen speaks as moral voice of the people.\n\nAt the time of his elevation, Zen was the only Chinese cardinal eligible to participate in papal conclaves. His elevation can be seen as giving hope to the underground Catholic Church in China.\n\nCardinal Zen offered a Pontifical High Mass in the Tridentine Rite in May 2006, for which he was thanked by traditionalist Catholics around the world.\n\nPope Benedict XVI named Cardinal Zen to write the meditations for the Stations of the Cross led by the Pope at the Roman Colisseum on Good Friday, 21 March 2008.\n\nAfter the pope canonized several priests who died during the Boxer Rebellion, Zen (as coadjutor bishop at the time) said that the priests were innocent and the Boxers guilty angering the Central People's Government, who banned him from visiting mainland China for six years. On 3 May 2004, he visited mainland China for the first time since 1998 and was the first bishop of Hong Kong to visit China since the transfer of sovereignty over Hong Kong in 1997.\n\nHe has also been especially critical of Beijing's response to the Falun Gong spiritualist movement, which China's leaders have outlawed for \"trying to overthrow\" the Communist Party. He also criticized the mainland government when it requested the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress to re-interpret the Basic Law. \n\nIn April and May 2006, Cardinal Zen opposed the episcopal consecration of two bishops in China who belonged to the state-sanctioned Chinese Catholic Patriotic Association. The elevations were without the permission of the Holy See, causing a controversy. In a February 2007 interview, Cardinal Zen referred the appointments without Vatican permission as a \"declaration of war\".\n\nIn October 2011, Zen admitted that, without the knowledge of the Holy See, he had received HK$20 million from Hong Kong tycoon Jimmy Lai since 2005, part of which went to helping the underground Church on the mainland.\n\nIn 2014 Cardinal Zen Ze-kiun asked Pope Francis not to visit China, saying the pontiff would be “manipulated”. In an interview he told the Italian newspaper Corriere della Sera: “I would tell him now, ‘Don’t come, you would be manipulated'. ...The few courageous [Catholics] could not meet [the Pope], and the Communist Party would show him the illegitimate bishops, including the three excommunicated ones.” The comments came as ties between the Vatican and China improved in the early days of the pontificate of Francis, with the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs congratulating Francis on his election\". Cardinal Zen said he did not see signs of dialogue happening between the Catholic Church and China. “Even if under these conditions Beijing was to extend a hand, it would be a trick under these circumstances,” he said. “Our poor bishops are slaves, the Communist Party denies them respect, tries to take away their dignity.”\n\nIn September 2014 as part of the 2014 Hong Kong protests, Cardinal Zen addressed the protesters saying \"It's high time we really showed that we want to be free and not to be slaves. ... We must unite together\". During his speech protesters were fired on with tear gas and he asked them to disperse.\n\nIn a 2018 interview Cardinal Zen, on Sino-Holy See relations, said “Pope Francis does not know the real Communist Party in China, but Parolin should know. He was there [in the Secretariat of State] so many years, so he must know. He may be happy to encourage the pope to be optimistic about the negotiations … but that’s dangerous. Pope Francis needs someone to calm him down from his enthusiasm.” Zen added that “It seems the Secretary of State wants to have a solution anyway. He is so optimistic. That’s dangerous. I told the pope that he [Parolin] has a poisoned mind. He is very sweet, but I have no trust in this person. He believes in diplomacy, not in our faith.”\n\nOn 5 June 2005, Zen announced that if the Legislative Council passed a proposal to support the schools to create incorporated management committees on 8 July 2005, he would appeal against the decision to the court. The Education (Amendment) Bill 2002, once enacted, would likely play down the role of the Church in running Catholic schools and in promoting Catholic education.\n\nHowever, after the Government gave up some argued points in the motion, the Diocese decided to support the motion, though the Diocese later announced plans to prosecute the Government on 28 September 2005.\n\nAfter two teachers committed suicide in early January 2006, Zen said that these acts must be due to the educational reforms and he asked the government to halt new reforms. Then Permanent Secretary for Education and Manpower Fanny Law rejected causal connections, but provoked furor among teachers and the public when she questioned why only two teachers committed suicide because of the reforms. She apologised for her \"inappropriate\" remarks on 10 January.\n\nOn 18 December 2005, Zen visited protesters at the 2005 WTO Ministerial Conference and tried to visit the detained South Korean Catholics, including two priests and a nun. He criticised the Hong Kong police for their treatment of the protesters. He also called the government a \"child\" for \"doing something nonsensical.'\" About one month later, several unions in Hong Kong Police Force decided to write a letter to the Pope to complain about Zen's speech. Zen replied that some policemen were \"sycophantic to the senior officers inside the police force\".\n\nSeveral local priests tried to persuade Zen not to participate in any protests before he led the 1 July Protest in 2007. Zen was only allowed to attend the prayer gathering before the protests against the educational reforms. Some Catholics criticized Zen for making the church like a \"political party\" and posted anti-Zen advertisements in newspapers and on the internet.\n\nIn January 2006, Rev. Joseph Lee, Parish Priest of St. Anthony's Church, who, similar to Zen, was born and educated in Shanghai and is a Salesian, said in a television programme that \"99% of Catholics disagree with the Bishop,\" while according to a survey more than 60% of Catholics agree with the Bishop. He also said that Zen seriously harmed the relationship between China and the Holy See.\n\nIn 2006 the Catholic official newspaper Kung Kao Po contained criticism and opinions by Rev. John B. Kwan Kit Tong against Zen. Four weeks later, Rev. Kwan claimed in the same newspaper that the criticism was not written directly against Zen and that his writing had been misinterpreted by local newspapers.\n\n\n\n\n"}

Kraybill. Like the widely used Thomas Kilmann Inventory (TKI), it is built around the Mouton-Blake grid and identifies five styles of responding to conflict, in this case: directing, harmonizing, avoiding, cooperating, and compromising.\n\nThe Kraybill model takes into consideration conflict response styles when things are going well (\"calm\") and when conflict increases (\"storm\"). KCSI is different from predecessors in the Mouton-Blake tradition in encouraging users to consider options for cultural adaptability, taking into account variation in participants' responses as appropriate to individualistic or collectivistic cultures.\n\nQuestions are in Likert Scale format, with users choosing a response on a scale of 1–7. Interpretation pages give principles for interpretation and tips for maximizing effectiveness of each style.\n\nAccording to the publisher's website, a PhD study in 2004 found it valid and reliable, however the research sample was small, less than a dozen subjects. In a second larger study, researchers at West Chester University of Pennsylvania administered Style Matters to more than 300 subjects and rated the inventory well on validity and reliability, standard benchmarks of consistency and accuracy of measurement in testing.\n\nIn his 2015 doctoral thesis, \"The Effect of Student-Generated Case Studies on Conflict Resolution Style Development\", David Nemitz used the Style Matters inventory to assess the impact of conflict resolution training on graduate students.\n\n\n"}

Kennedy.\n\nMarietta Endicott Peabody was the only daughter of Malcolm Endicott Peabody, the rector of Grace Episcopal Church in Lawrence, Massachusetts, and Mary Elizabeth Parkman. Her grandfather Rev. Endicott Peabody was founder and first headmaster of Groton School where her four brothers Endicott, Samuel, George, and Malcolm were educated.\n\nAlthough born into an old New England family, Tree's parents were strictly middle-class, and were among the old-line Yankees and Episcopalians in what was fast becoming the Roman Catholic stronghold of Lawrence. Tree's mother Mary was an extensive charity worker, and encouraged her daughter to get involved with the community.\n\nTree attended St. Timothy's School, where she excelled in athletics above studies. An effervescent, leggy blonde, she was an accomplished flirt and irresistible to men from an early age. She undertook a grand tour of Europe and finishing school in Florence upon graduation to avoid college. When asked to predict her own future, she wrote down: \"Parties, people, and politics.\"\n\nHer father insisted that she, unlike many society girls of the time, attend college, and she enrolled at the University of Pennsylvania in 1936. Although she withdrew from the Class of 1940, reflecting the era's skepticism of higher education for women, in later interviews she would exclaim: \"I'll never stop being grateful to my father for forcing me to go to college. It changed my life.\" In 1964 she was presented with an honorary Doctor of Laws degree, and in 1971 with an honorary Bachelor of Arts. She is also an honorary member of Alpha Kappa Alpha Sorority.\n\nDuring college, Marietta was courted by Harvard law graduate and New York City lawyer \nDesmond FitzGerald. The couple married on September 2, 1939, and Marietta gave birth to a daughter Frances FitzGerald, who later became a noted journalist and historian. \n\nMarietta began a career as a fact checker despite having no college degree and no prior journalistic experience, and latterly writer for \"Time\" magazine. At night she partied with the Astors, Paleys, and Warburgs, describing these years as \"a fever of happiness.\"\n\nHer ardent liberal Democratic views clashed with those of her Republican husband and created tensions in the marriage. After America entered the Second World War in December 1941, Marietta accepted a post as part of the American delegation assisting the British Ministry of Information.\n\nWhen Desmond left New York to fulfill a role in the war effort, Marietta started a passionate and intense affair with the film director John Huston. Rumors, ones often perpetuated by Tree's daughters and friends, liked to paint Marietta as \"the only woman Huston ever truly loved.\"\n\nAlthough contemplating marriage with Huston, Marietta and FitzGerald were invited to Barbados by a colleague from the British Ministry of Information. Ronald Tree, whose mother was the daughter of retail magnate Marshall Field, was then a dollar billionaire; he himself was then MP for Harborough, Leicestershire and friend of Winston Churchill. Although both were married, Marietta and Tree began an affair.\n\nAlthough he was bisexual and twenty years older than Marietta, Tree and Peabody divorced their respective partners at the end of World War II and married on July 26, 1947. Marietta moved into Tree's home, Ditchley Park, but found herself bored with English country life. Tree and most of his friends were Conservatives, and Democrat Marietta again found herself politically isolated. Their daughter Penelope was born in 1949.\n\nFor the first time in his life short of money, Ronald Tree sold Ditchley and agreed to return to New York City with Marietta, her daughter Frances Fitzgerald and their own daughter, future '60s fashion model Penelope Tree, and his butler Collins.\n\nMarietta Tree immediately joined the Lexington Democratic Club, and two years later was elected the county chairwoman. She was elected to the Democratic State Committee in 1954.\n\nIn 1952, Tree became involved in the Presidential election campaign of Adlai Stevenson. After his defeat, the two became constant companions and lovers, but Ronald Tree was unfazed and even invited Stevenson to the couple's homes in New York, Barbados and London. Marietta and Stevenson developed code names for each other – Mr. and Mrs. Johnson, and Mr. and Mrs. Richardson – and arranged trysts at various friends' houses that they considered safe.\n\nTree was part of Stevenson's unsuccessful 1956 Presidential campaign, and upon his return to a legal career the pair continued their affair but became slightly more distant. Stevenson also took other lovers, keeping Marietta on edge, frequently disclosing his encounters by stockpiling in a drawer by his bed a number of poems and meditations of love that he would send and receive from various women.\n\nThis encouraged Tree's earlier lover, the film director John Huston, who even gave her a role in his 1960 movie \"The Misfits\". However, she was devoted to Stevenson, and although she refused to divorce Tree, she gladly accepted John F. Kennedy's offer of becoming the United States Representative to the United Nations Commission on Human Rights, aptly appointed under Stevenson as the head of the American delegation. She served in this position from 1961 to 1964.\n\nOn July 14, 1965, Tree and Stevenson were walking in London when he suffered a heart attack, and later died at St George's Hospital. That night in her diary, she wrote: \"Adlai is dead. We were together.\"\n\nRonald and Marietta became virtually estranged. Ronald Tree died of a stroke on July 14, 1976, in London, while Marietta was in New York.\n\nRonald Tree left Marietta with little money, and she was forced to sell much of the couple's property to remain financially stable. She started an affair with English architect Richard Llewelyn-Davies, and financed the married man's business expansion into the United States. But Davies died suddenly, and Tree was forced to cover some of the estate's debts.\n\nTree through her connections was able to obtain some well paid directorships, including the boards of CBS, Pan Am, and Lend Lease Corporation of Australia. She also served as women's trustee on the board of the University of Pennsylvania. These positions and incomes enabled her to not only support herself, but resist calls from her later publishing and political community lovers to write her memoirs, including lover Eben Pyne. She also served on the Metropolitan Museum of Art’s 100th Anniversary Committee.\n\nIn 1987 she appeared in the Danny Huston film \"Mr. North\", released about a month before John Huston died of emphysema on August 28, 1987. Her friends in the 1980s included Donald Trump, Charles Wrightsman (who in 1986 bought the Lorenzo Lotto artwork \"Venus and Cupid\" in her honour for the Metropolitan Museum of Art); and President Ronald and Nancy Reagan, the latter of whom she was criticized for in the Democratic party, which she worked for until 1990 when she was diagnosed with breast cancer.\n\nTree fought breast cancer hard, including undertaking a double mastectomy, and told her friends she was suffering from influenza. Tree died on August 15, 1991, at her home in New York. Her ashes were buried by her daughters.\n\nTree was brought up in a strict household, whose requirements she transferred to her own daughters: they never had dolls when children. \n\nIsaiah Berlin characterized her political standing as, \"a progressive, liberal figure who was mixed up with a lot of naive left-wing sympathizers.\" Like her contemporary Pamela Harriman, Marietta attained through men what women of her time were forbidden to attain for themselves. As the feminist movement gained momentum in the 1960s, Marietta refused to support its cause, and in 1967 she angered her fellow female delegates to the New York state constitutional convention, by refusing to sign three resolutions pertaining to women's rights.\n\n\n"}

Each LBC was required to choose an Oil Marketing Company to supply them with premix fuel. Proceeds from the sale of premix fuel at the landing beaches are to be used in developing the fishing communities in the country.\n\nA National Premix Secretariat (NPS) was formed to service the NPC. The allotment and distribution of premix fuel is undertaken by the NPS. Requests made weekly for the distribution of premix fuel are sent to the Tema Oil Reﬁnery (TOR). TOR refines and loads the product into tankers of the assigned Oil Marketing Companies (OMCs) for distribution to the various Landing Beach Committees.\n\nThe NPC’s responsibility is to supervise the efficient and effective administration and distribution of premix fuel. Since premix fuel is highly subsidized by the government, the NPC makes sure that monitoring is enforced to avoid diversion or inappropriate distribution. The NPC are tasked to ensure that the proceeds from the sale of premix fuel are being used to develop the fishing communities in the country. Diverse developmental projects were undertaken by majority of the LBCs.\n\nThe following are directorates of the Ministry of Fisheries and Aquaculture Development (MoFAD) with each directorate headed by a director.\n\nMoFAD and its agencies (the Fisheries Commission and the National Premix Secretariat) work hand in hand with over 80% of the Ministries in Ghana and other entities in order to develop a reliable, disciplined, manageable, and sustainable fisheries sector for Ghanaian's.\n\nThe Ministry of Fisheries and Aquaculture Development (MOFAD) was formed under the 1992 Constitution of the republic of Ghana and backed by the Laws of the Land.It takes into consideration the “FISHERIES (AMENDMENT) REGULATIONS , 2015 (L.I. 2217)”\n\n\n"}

{"id": "30872156", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=30872156", "title": "Open-source political campaign", "text": "Open-source political campaign\n\nOpen-source political campaigns, open-source politics, or Politics 2.0, is the idea that social networking and e-participation technologies will revolutionize our ability to follow, support, and influence political campaigns. Netroots evangelists and web consultants predict a wave of popular democracy as fundraisers meet on MySpace or Facebook, YouTubers crank out attack ads and bloggers do opposition research.\n\nTypically these terms describe short-term limited-life efforts to achieve a specific goal. Longer term projects involving embedded institutions (of journalism, parties, government itself) are more often called \"open-source governance\" projects. All open politics share some very basic assumptions however including the belief that online deliberation can improve decisions.\n\nIn print, open-source politics was first used by political operatives in the lead-up to the 2004 United States elections. The earliest reference to the term in major media was a September 5, 2003 story in Salon.com in which supporters of the Draft Clark campaign and of Vermont Governor Howard Dean both claimed that their campaigns represented the ideals of \"open-source politics.\" The term was meant as a reference to open-source software such the Linux operating system, which is designed to allow users to alter its code to make improvements. The idea was that new technologies would allow similar participation and the attendant benefits in the political realm. The story omitted the fact that Dean's campaign had actually begun to employ these tools only by the initiative of the Meetup.com bot, a simple string-matching algorithm that began to schedule meetings \"about Howard Dean\" when the number of people listing this string in their interests hit a critical mass.\n\nThe term was further refined in its current usage by a story in \"The Nation\" by Micah Sifry which appeared days after the 2004 election. Sifry wrote that open-source politics means \"opening up participation in planning and implementation to the community, letting competing actors evaluate the value of your plans and actions, being able to shift resources away from bad plans and bad planners and toward better ones, and expecting more of participants in return. It would mean moving away from egocentric organizations and toward network-centric organizing.\" Since Sifry's article, the term has appeared on numerous blogs and print articles.\n\nSince the 2004 United States elections, the internet has become much more participatory and interactive with the popularization of Web 2.0 technologies such as Myspace, YouTube, Second Life and Wikipedia. This participation, the idea goes, lends new currency to the notion that these technologies can be employed to allow citizens to \"reprogram\" politics. One example is the way that the Macaca video spread virally through the internet on YouTube and contributed to the electoral defeat of Sen. George Allen of Virginia during the 2006 U.S. midterm elections. The old \"source code\" of politics allowed candidates to get away with making off-the-cuff comments if journalists did not pick up on them, but services such as YouTube have changed that, and now politicians must be more careful not to say things that will come back to haunt them. In short, the idea is that citizen can rewrite the old codes of politics by using these new technologies to promote change. The term \"open-source politics\" was heavily employed in this context in the July/August 2007 issue of the magazine \"Mother Jones,\" where the definition appeared in a format that was modeled on a Wikipedia article.\n\nA similar term, \"open-source governance,\" refers to overhauling or replacing existing government institutions in order to allow direct citizen input into the government. The narrower term \"open politics\" refers to a specific theory derived from those of Bernard Crick and others advocating development of political virtues, and strict adherence to human rights law.\n\nBy contrast, open-source politics is a term favored by technologists, and is often used interchangeably with the term \"politics 2.0.\" Politics 2.0 has been covered by leading sites Mother Jones, the BBC, GigaOM, TechCrunch and techPresident, among others.\n\nSome people, especially from the software engineering industry, dislike the term open-source politics because they feel that the technologies that the term references are not open source. For example, YouTube and MySpace do not operate under an open-source licence. Proponents of the term argue that \"open-source politics\" is a preferable term to \"open politics\" because the term \"open source\" is an artful way to reference the idea that it is technology that is making politics more participatory. Opponents are concerned that use of the term \"open source\" in this context causes unnecessary confusion, and it has been suggested that the term \"open politics\" or politics 2.0 be used instead.\n\nThose who believe that open-source politics will have a major impact on elections and government include many former staffers of Gov. Howard Dean's political campaign, many political bloggers, and members of the New Politics Institute, the Personal Democracy Forum, and the Center for Politics, Democracy and the Internet.\n\nInternet entrepreneur Jimmy Wales was asked by \"Mother Jones\" about his thoughts on the potential impact of open-source politics on old models of political campaigning such as polling and TV attack ads. He said this:\nHopefully, you start to see a little bit of diminished effectiveness when people can talk back to attack ads. In the past, when you'd see a vicious attack ad, you might find it distasteful, but you might also wonder if that person did that horrible thing. Online, you begin to see some of those things start to unravel, and people responding and saying, \"Yeah, this is an attack ad, and this is what really happened.\" Then you get a more interesting dialogue around that.\nA lot of the polling that goes on is push polling, in that the questions being asked are being framed to get answers they want. Those kinds of things get harder to sustain when you have a large body of people who can push back and put out an alternative point of view.\n\nThe rise in the use of social media for revolutionary purposes and political activism has been shown in academic literature and surpasses previous forms of political activism in terms of popularity and influence. World leaders are taking notice of social media driven activism and British Prime Minister David Cameron was even quoted during the Tottenham riots as saying, “Everyone watching these horrific events will be struck by how they were organized via social media”. This exemplifies the power that social media and Web 2.0 platforms are capable of having to advance social change and political change. Historically, social and political activism has been organized and pursued through traditional means, such as posters, word of mouth, and the various forms of media. Social media revolutions include the use of numerous social media platforms that make up the “Web 2.0”. Twitter is at the heart of social activism and can be used proactively to accomplish many different end goals.\n\nWe can look to Chander and Fuch’s research for evidence of technological change, as both cases being studied took place around 2011. Although 2011 was only four years ago, technology has the tendency to advance so quickly that once a certain technology is on the market, new technology is already being developed to replace the existing technology. This may hold many different potential futures for social media driven activism, whether for the greater good of citizens or perhaps giving state governments more power to fight activism or potential activism before it even starts.\n\nInformation Communication Technologies (ICT) encompass a wide range of technological means that give access to various forms of media, the Internet, social media, and other technologies. The complexity of ICTs around the world differs greatly between the Global North and Global South, as access to funds to purchase ICTs in the Global South is limited. The Global South has a large number of radios compared to the rest of the world due to their wide availability, ease of use, and limited technology needed to operate. Global South states often do not have the technological advancements in place to support more complex technology, although the use of mobile phones to access the Internet is growing. Without these technologies available to citizens in states around the globe, with the most notable being Global South countries, the citizens are being put at a disadvantage from the start. Political problems such as corrupt governments, authoritarian regimes, and limited democratic functionalities, also hinder citizen participation in Global South states’ political activism because of the lack of technology available.\n\nSome people discount the potential impacts. Skeptics include many people on the American political right, among them the lobbyist Grover Norquist of Americans for Tax Reform. Others include Nicholas Lemann, Dean of the Columbia School of Journalism, who has said open-source politics may eventually be co-opted by political parties.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "7843", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=7843", "title": "Planned economy", "text": "Planned economy\n\nA planned economy is a type of economic system where investment and the allocation of capital goods take place according to economy-wide economic and production plans. A planned economy may use centralized, decentralized or participatory forms of economic planning. A command economy or administrative command economy is any of the nominally-planned economies of the former Soviet Union and Eastern Block - these terms highlight the central role of hierarchical administration in guiding the allocation of resources in these economic systems as opposed to planned coordination.\n\nPlanned economies are usually associated with Soviet-type central planning, which involves centralized state planning and administrative decision-making. In command economies, important allocation-decisions are made by government authorities and are imposed by law. Planned economies contrast with unplanned economies, specifically market economies, where autonomous firms operating in markets make decisions about production, distribution, pricing and investment. Market economies that use indicative planning are sometimes referred to as “planned market economies”.\n\nThe traditional conception of socialism involves the integration of socially-owned economic enterprises via some form of planning with direct calculation substituting factor markets. As such, the concept of a planned economy is often associated with socialism and with \"socialist planning\". More recent approaches to socialist planning and allocation have come from some economists and computer scientists proposing planning mechanisms based on advances in computer science and information technology.\n\nPlanned economies contrast with \"command\" economies. A planned economy is \"an economic system in which the government controls and regulates production, distribution, prices, etc.\" but a command economy, while also having this type of regulation, necessarily has substantial public ownership of industry. Therefore, command economies are planned economies, but not necessarily the reverse.\n\nMost of a command economy is organized in a top-down administrative model by a central authority, where decisions regarding investment and production output requirements are decided upon at the top in the chain of command, with little input from lower levels. Advocates of economic planning have sometimes been staunch critics of these command economies. For example, Leon Trotsky believed that those at the top of the chain of command, regardless of their intellectual capacity, operated without the input and participation of the millions of people who participate in the economy and who understand/respond to local conditions and changes in the economy, and therefore would be unable to effectively coordinate all economic activity.\n\nAlthough historians have associated planned economies with Marxist-Leninist states and the Soviet economic model, some argue that the Soviet economic model did not actually constitute a planned economy in that a comprehensive and binding plan did not guide production and investment; therefore the further distinction of an \"administrative command economy\" emerged as a more accurate designation for the economic system that existed in the former Soviet Union and Eastern bloc, highlighting the role of centralized hierarchical decision-making in the absence of popular control over the economy. The possibility of a digital planned economy was explored in Chile in 1971-1973 with the development of Project Cybersyn and by , head of the Department of Technical Physics in Kiev in 1962.\n\nAnother key point is that command economies are inherently authoritarian, whereas economic planning in general can be either participatory and democratic or authoritarian. Indicative planning is a form of planning in market economies that directs the economy through incentive-based methods. Economic planning can be practiced in a decentralized manner through different government authorities. For example, in some predominately market-oriented and mixed economies, the state utilizes economic planning in strategic industries such as the aerospace industry. Mixed economies usually employ macroeconomic planning, while micro-economic affairs are left to the market and price system.\n\nNote too the utilization of dirigisme, or government direction of the economy through non-coercive means, as practiced in France and in Great Britain after the Second World War. The Swedish government planned public-housing models in a similar fashion as urban planning in a project called Million Programme, implemented 1965-1974.\n\nIn the Hellenistic and post-Hellenistic world, \"compulsory state planning was the most characteristic trade condition for the Egyptian countryside, for Hellenistic India, and to a lesser degree the more barbaric regions of the Seleucid, the Pergamenian, the southern Arabian, and the Parthian empires [...].\"\n\nOne view of mercantilism sees it as a planned economy.\n\nThe Soviet-style planned economy started with war communism (1918-1921). The Soviet government founded Gosplan in 1921, but the period of the NEP intervened before regular Five-year plans started in 1928.\n\nThe government can harness land, labours, and capital to serve the economic objectives of the state. Consumer demand can be restrained in favor of greater capital investment for economic development in a desired pattern. In international comparisons, state-socialist nations compared favorably with capitalist nations in health indicators such as infant mortality and life expectancy, although the statistics concerning infant mortality are self-reported and based on varying standards. The state can begin building a heavy industry at once in an underdeveloped economy without waiting years for capital to accumulate through the expansion of light industry, and without reliance on external financing. This is what happened in the Soviet Union during the 1930s when the government forced the share of GNP dedicated to private consumption from eighty percent to fifty percent. As a result, the Soviet Union experienced massive growth in heavy industry, with a concurrent massive contraction of its agricultural sector, in both relative and absolute terms.\n\nCritics of planned economies argue that planners cannot detect consumer preferences, shortages, and surpluses with sufficient accuracy and therefore cannot efficiently co-ordinate production (in a market economy, a free price system is intended to serve this purpose). This difficulty was notably written about by economists Ludwig von Mises and Friedrich Hayek, who referred to subtly distinct aspects of the problem as the \"economic calculation problem\" and \"local knowledge problem\" respectively. Whereas the former stressed the theoretical underpinnings of a market economy to subjective value theory while attacking the labor theory of value, the latter argued that the only way to satisfy individuals who have a constantly changing hierarchy of needs, and are the only ones to possess their particular individual's circumstances, is by allowing those with the most knowledge of their needs to have it in their power to use their resources in a competing marketplace to meet the needs of the most consumers, most efficiently. This phenomenon is recognized as spontaneous order. Additionally, misallocation of resources would naturally ensue by redirecting capital away from individuals with direct knowledge and circumventing it into markets where a coercive monopoly influences behavior, ignoring market signals. According to Tibor R. Machan, \"Without a market in which allocations can be made in obedience to the law of supply and demand, it is difficult or impossible to funnel resources with respect to actual human preferences and goals.\"\n\nEconomist Robin Hahnel notes that, even if central planning overcame its inherent inhibitions of incentives and innovation, it would nevertheless be unable to maximize economic democracy and self-management, which he believes are concepts that are more intellectually coherent, consistent and just than mainstream notions of economic freedom.\n\nSays Hahnel, \"Combined with a more democratic political system, and redone to closer approximate a best case version, centrally planned economies no doubt would have performed better. But they could never have delivered economic self-management, they would always have been slow to innovate as apathy and frustration took their inevitable toll, and they would always have been susceptible to growing inequities and inefficiencies as the effects of differential economic power grew. Under central planning neither planners, managers, nor workers had incentives to promote the social economic interest. Nor did impeding markets for final goods to the planning system enfranchise consumers in meaningful ways. But central planning would have been incompatible with economic democracy even if it had overcome its information and incentive liabilities. And the truth is that it survived as long as it did only because it was propped up by unprecedented totalitarian political power.\"\n\nStudies of Eastern European planned economies in the 1950s and 1960s by both American and Eastern European economists found that, contrary to the expectations of both groups, they showed greater fluctuations in output than market economies during the same period.\n\nWhile socialism is not equivalent to economic planning or to the concept of a planned economy, an influential conception of socialism involves the replacement of capital markets with some form of economic planning in order to achieve ex-ante coordination of the economy. The goal of such an economic system would be to achieve conscious control over the economy by the population, specifically, so that the use of the surplus product is controlled by the producers. The specific forms of planning proposed for socialism and their feasibility are subjects of the socialist calculation debate.\n\nIn their book \"Towards a New Socialism\" (1993) the computer scientist Paul Cockshott from the University of Glasgow and the economist Allin Cottrell from the Wake Forest University claim to demonstrate, in detail, how a democratically planned economy built on modern computer technology is possible and drives the thesis that it would be both economically more stable than the free market economies and also morally desirable.\n\nIn 1971, when the development of computer technology was still its early stages, the socialist Allende administration of Chile launched Project Cybersyn to install a telex machine in every corporation and organisation in the economy for the communication of economic data between firms and the government. The data was also fed into a computer simulated economy for forecasting. A control room was built for realtime observation and management of the overall economy. The prototype-stage of the project showed promise when it was used to redirect supplies around a trucker's strike but in 1973, after CIA-backed Augusto Pinochet led a coup and then established a dictatorship under his rule, he abolished the program to move Chile towards a more liberalized market economy.\n\nThe 1888 novel \"Looking Backward\" by Edward Bellamy depicts a fictional planned economy in a United States around the year 2000 which has become a socialist utopia.\n\nThe World State in Aldous Huxley's \"Brave New World\" and Airstrip One in George Orwell's \"Nineteen Eighty-Four\" are both fictional examples of command economies, albeit with diametrically opposed aims: The former is a consumer economy designed to engender productivity while the latter is a shortage economy designed as an agent of totalitarian social control. Airstrip One is organised by the euphemistically named Ministry of Plenty.\n\nOther literary portrayals of planned economies were Yevgeny Zamyatin's \"We\", which was an influence on Orwell's work. Like \"Nineteen Eighty Four\", Ayn Rand's dystopian story \"Anthem\" was also an artistic portrayal of a command economy that was influenced by \"We\". The difference is that it was a primitivist planned economy, as opposed to the advanced technology of \"We\" or \"Brave New World\".\n\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "37631009", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=37631009", "title": "Radio propaganda", "text": "Radio propaganda\n\nRadio propaganda is propaganda aimed at influencing attitudes towards a certain cause or position, delivered through radio broadcast. The power of radio propaganda came from its revolutionary nature. The radio, like later technological advances in the media, allowed information to be transmitted quickly and uniformly to vast populations. Internationally, the radio was an early and powerful recruiting tool for propaganda campaigns.\n\nBefore television, radio was by far the most effective way to prevent or promote social change. In many areas, it still is. Radio propaganda can be broadcast over great distances to a large audience at a relatively low cost. Through radio, a propagandist can bring his voice and all the persuasive power of his emotions to millions of people. A similar approach is used in every war employing radio propaganda: aside from convincing those on the home front of the necessity of war, a different kind of propaganda must be directed towards the enemy. Radio became a powerful propaganda tool because it ignored national borders and made enemy lines more accessible. One of the most common ways hosts got the civilian and enemy populations to listen to their broadcasts was by dropping leaflets from hot air balloons or airplanes. Most programs were broadcast on selected stations at certain times of the day; the dropped leaflets explained exactly when and where the broadcasts could be heard.\n\nThe use of radio as a wartime propaganda tool was made famous during World War II by broadcasting organizations such as Voice of America and by shows such as Tokyo Rose, Axis Sally, and Lord Haw Haw.\n\nThe radio was an important tool of the Nazi propaganda efforts and it has been argued that it was the Nazis who pioneered the use of what was still a relatively new technology. A few months after the break out of World War II, German propagandists were transmitting no less than eleven hours a day of programs, offering most of them in English as well. In the first year of Nazi propaganda programming, broadcasters attempted to destroy pro-British feeling rather than arouse pro-German sentiment. These propagandists targeted certain groups, including capitalists, Jews, and selected newspapers/politicians. By the summer of 1940, the Nazis had abandoned all attempts to win American sympathy and the tone of German radio broadcasts towards the United States had become critical.\n\nGerman propaganda minister, Joseph Goebbels, was well aware of the necessity to seize every opportunity to benefit and promote the Third Reich. Goebbels claimed the radio was the \"eighth great power\" and he, along with the Nazi party, recognized the power of the radio in the propaganda machine of Nazi Germany. Recognizing the importance of radio in disseminating the Nazi message, Goebbels approved a mandate whereby millions of cheap radio sets were subsidized by the government and distributed to German citizens. It was Goebbels' job to propagate the anti-Bolshevik statements of Hitler and aim them directly at neighboring countries with German-speaking minorities. In Goebbels' \"Radio as the Eighth Great Power\" speech, he proclaimed:\n\nAs well as domestic broadcasts, the Nazi regime used the radio to deliver its message to both occupied territories and enemy states. One of the main targets was the United Kingdom to which William Joyce broadcast regularly, gaining him the nickname “Lord Haw-Haw” in the process. Broadcasts were also made to the United States, notably through Robert Henry Best and 'Axis Sally', Mildred Gillars.\n\nBritish propaganda during the First World War set a new benchmark that inspired the fascist and socialist regimes during the Second World War and the Cold War; Marshal Paul von Hindenburg stated, “This English propaganda was a new weapon, or rather a weapon which had never been employed on such a scale and so ruthlessly in the past.” It was clear that large numbers of civilians could be mobilized for a massive war effort through persuasive techniques derived from the emerging disciplines of behavioral psychology and social sciences.\n\nAn example of effective radio propaganda by the United States for Great Britain is the news reports of Edward R. Murrow. When the United Kingdom stood alone to face the German onslaught in the autumn of 1940, Murrow covered the Battle of Britain and particularly the nightly bombing raids on London. His reports described the falling of the bombs, their impact, and the destruction they brought. Murrow developed his own inimitable style, known for its colourful, vivid imagery. Neither melancholy nor soapy, his reports were so rich in detail and description that listeners could almost smell the fumes from the fires burning in the streets of London and feel the heat emanating from the smoldering ruins. Without question, this was radio reporting at its best, and there was also no doubt about its impact. As he described his approach to a London newspaper in 1941, “The official news is perhaps less important than the more intimate stories of life, work, and sacrifice.”\n\nMurrow kept his focus squarely on the common man and how to reach him. He wanted to let the world know that the United Kingdom was fighting a “people’s war,” not a war for its colonies, as the American isolationists charged. He wanted Americans to know that the UK was standing tall, united in its cause and protecting Western liberties and European civilisation. He wanted Americans to see the UK as their natural ally and hurry to extend a helping hand. Because of his reputation and impact, Murrow’s role evolved into much more than that of a broadcaster. Many say he had far greater influence than the American ambassador to London; “He was an ambassador, in a double role, representing Britain in America as well as America in Britain... He was a diplomat without a portfolio, a spokesman for a cause.” \n\nHistorians believe the moment when American radio made its debut as the preeminent means of foreign news was the Munich Crisis in September 1938. Early that month, Hitler began implementing his plans to dominate Europe by demanding self-determination for Germans living in a region of Czechoslovakia known as the Sudetenland. He left few doubts that he meant to annex the Sudetenland as part of an enlarged German Reich. High-level negotiations ensued, during which Britain’s Prime Minister, Neville Chamberlain, journeyed to Germany three times in less than three weeks in a desperate attempt to save the peace. Fearful that a European war would once again entangle them, Americans became glued to their radios for daily and sometimes hourly updates and interpretations of the latest developments of the crisis. Within a couple of days, American listeners were bombarded with news programs, special news bulletins, and expert commentary on the crisis.\n\nAmerica’s first real venture into international broadcasting was in 1940 after Nazi victories in Europe, when the Roosevelt administration was becoming increasingly concerned about the effects of Nazi propaganda, both domestically and internationally. In August 1940, President Roosevelt issued an Executive Order establishing the Office of Coordination of Commercial and Cultural Relations to promote the use of government/private radio, and the Office of the Coordinator of Information. By 1942, the most famous radio program airing overseas became known as the “Voice of America.” Even before the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor, the U.S. government's Office of the Coordinator of Information began providing war news and commentary to commercial American shortwave radio stations for use on a voluntary basis.\n\nA popular government wartime radio show, performed by President Franklin D. Roosevelt, was known as \"fireside chats\". Two of the most famous programs on the radio show were entitled \"On National Security\" and \"On the Declaration of War with Japan\". “The Arsenal of Democracy” was a slogan coined by President Roosevelt during his national security radio broadcast delivered on December 29, 1940. Roosevelt promised to help Great Britain fight Nazi Germany by providing them with military supplies in a program known as Lend-Lease, while the United States stayed out of the actual fighting. This announcement was made a year before the attacks on Pearl Harbor, at a time when Germany had occupied much of Europe and threatened Great Britain. The day after the attack on Pearl Harbor, Roosevelt delivered his famous Infamy Speech to the United States, which was broadcast to the American people. The President called for a formal declaration of war on the Empire of Japan. The Infamy Speech was brief, running to just a little over seven minutes, and Roosevelt made a point of emphasizing that the United States and her interests were in grave danger. In so doing, he sought to end the isolationist stance the United States had previously been advocating concerning involvement in the war. The overall tone of the speech was one of determined realism. Roosevelt made no attempt to glaze over the extensive damage that had been caused to the American armed forces, noting the number of American lives lost in the attack. However, he emphasized his confidence in the strength of the America to face the challenge posed by Japan.\n\nWith this declaration of war, radio became part of the propaganda campaign. Throughout the war, the attack on Pearl Harbor was frequently used in American propaganda. Direct wartime programming began shortly after the United States entry into the war. The first live broadcast to Germany, called \"Stimmen aus Amerika\" (\"Voices from America\") took place on Feb 1, 1942. It was introduced by \"The Battle Hymn of the Republic\" and included the pledge: \"Today, and every day from now on, we will be with you from America to talk about the war... The news may be good or bad for us – We will always tell you the truth.\"\n\nThe Armed Forces Radio Service created a number of radio shows for American GIs stationed overseas. The most popular of these \"mosquito networks\" was GI Jive. In Agra, India, Virginia C. Claudon Allen broadcast nightly to counter Tokyo Rose.\n\nDuring World War II, American GIs in both the Pacific and European theaters of war heard anonymous voices on the radio playing carefully selected American music and extolling the virtues of Japanese and Nazi causes. The DJs continuously encouraged GIs to stop fighting and constantly made false claims of American defeats and Japanese or Nazi victories. They frequently referred to specific American units and individuals by name, and in rare cases mentioned the names of loved ones back home. GIs dubbed the voice from Japan \"Tokyo Rose\"; two popular voices from Germany were \"Axis Sally\" and “Lord Haw-Haw”.\n\n\"Tokyo Rose\": After being stranded in Japan while visiting her sick aunt after the United States refused to let her reenter the country after the attack on Pearl Harbor, Iva Toguri wound up at Radio Tokyo as a typist, preparing English-language scripts drafted by Japanese authorities for broadcast to the Allied troops in the Pacific. At Radio Tokyo, Toguri met captured Australian Major Charles Cousens and his associates, American Captain Wallace Ince and Filipino Lieutenant Normando Reyes. A supporter of the Allies in the war, she was delighted to meet soldiers who had been fighting for her side. Put off by her overt friendliness and pro-Americanism, the POWs initially suspected her of being a Kempeitai spy, but over the next few months they eventually came to trust her. When Radio Tokyo directed Cousens to include a woman DJ in his Zero Hour program, he asked for Toguri by name. Since their capture and conscription into Radio Tokyo, the Allied POWs had waged a covert campaign to sabotage the Japanese propaganda effort through the use of on-air innuendos, satire, and sarcastic, rushed or muffled readings. Now they had to bring a fourth party into the conspiracy, and the only person they could trust to support their efforts was Toguri. She was dubbed with the name \"Tokyo Rose\" and listeners came to know her by that name.\n\nAfter the war, the Army Counter Intelligence Corps, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and the press continued to refer to Toguri by that name as she was taken into custody and brought to trial. Those defending Toguri stated that she was clearly \"forced\" to broadcast for the Japanese and was always a loyal American, shown by her many attempts to return home, which were continuously rejected. They also pointed to the lack of \"tangible\" evidence; American investigators never discovered any Japanese documents with the name \"Tokyo Rose\" because \"Tokyo Rose\" was a name coined by American GIs. However, under the United States Constitution, treason is the act of providing \"aid and comfort\" to an enemy. It does not say that force, loneliness, trickery, coercion, or fright are mitigating factors in favor of traitors. On October 6, 1949, Toguri was sentenced to 10 years in prison and fined $10,000. She served less than half that time and was pardoned by President Gerald Ford.\n\n\"Axis Sally\" was the pseudonym of Mildred Gillars, an American broadcaster employed by the Third Reich in Nazi Germany to proliferate propaganda during World War II. By 1941, the U.S. State Department advised American nationals to return home, but Gillars chose to stay in Germany after her fiancé, a German citizen named Paul Karlson, refused to marry her if she returned to the United States. Shortly afterwards, Karlson was sent to the Eastern Front, where he died in action. In 1940 she obtained work as an announcer with the \"Reichs-Rundfunk-Gesellschaft\" (RRG), German State Radio. On December 7, 1941, Gillars was working in the studio when the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor was announced. She broke down in front of her colleagues and announced her allegiance to the East. However, since she decided to stay in Germany, Gillar was faced with the prospect of joblessness or prison, so she produced a written oath of allegiance to Germany and returned to work, her duties being limited to announcing records and participating in chat shows. She soon acquired several names amongst her GI listeners, including Berlin Bitch, Berlin Babe, Olga, and Sally, but the one that became most common was “Axis Sally.” \n\nHer most successful show was known as \"Home Sweet Home\". \"Home Sweet Home\" attempted to exploit the fears of American soldiers about the home front. The broadcasts were designed to make the soldiers cast doubt on their mission, their leaders, and their prospects after the war. Another show was known as \"Midge at the Mike\", broadcast to late fall 1943. Gillar played American songs interspersed with defeatist propaganda and anti-Semitic rhetoric, as well as \"G.I.’s Letter box and Medical Reports\" in 1944, in which Gillars used information on wounded and captured U.S. airmen to cause fear and worry in their families. She was convicted of treason by the United States in 1949 following her capture in post-war Berlin. Her arrest came about after the U.S. attorney general specially dispatched prosecutor Victor C. Woerheide to Berlin to find and arrest Gillars. He only had one solid lead: Raymond Kurtz, a B-17 pilot shot down by the Germans, recalled that a woman who had visited his prison camp seeking interviews was the broadcaster. Gillars was indicted on September 10, 1948, and charged with 10 counts of treason, but only eight were presented at her trial, which began on January 25, 1949. The prosecution relied on the large number of her programs recorded by the Federal Communications Commission to demonstrate her active participation in propaganda activities against the United States. It was also shown that she had made an oath of allegiance to Adolf Hitler. She was sentenced to 10 to 30 years in prison and a $10,000 fine.\n\n\"Lord Haw-Haw\" was a pseudonym for William Joyce, German radio's most prominent English-language speaker. He hosted a propaganda show on a radio program called \"Germany Calling\", broadcast by Nazi German radio to audiences in Great Britain on the station\n\"Reichssender Hamburg\". The program started on September 18, 1939 and continued until April 30, 1945, when Hamburg was overrun by the British Army. Through his broadcasts, the Reich Ministry of Public Enlightenment and Propaganda attempted to discourage and demoralize British, Canadian, Australian, and American troops and the British population within radio range to suppress the effectiveness of the Allied war effort through propaganda and to motivate the Allies to agree to peace terms leaving the Nazi regime intact and in power. The Nazi broadcasts prominently reported on the shooting down of Allied aircraft and the sinking of Allied ships, presenting discouraging reports of high losses and casualties among Allied forces. Although listening to his broadcasts was highly discouraged, many Britons did indeed tune into them. In 1940, at the height of his influence, Joyce had an estimated 6 million regular and 18 million occasional listeners in Great Britain.\n\nAt the end of the war, Joyce was captured by British forces at Flensburg, near the German border with Denmark. Spotting a dishevelled figure resting from gathering firewood, intelligence soldiers engaged him in conversation, asked if he was Joyce, and when he reached in his pocket for his false passport, the soldiers, believing he was armed, shot him in the buttocks, leaving four wounds. Joyce was charged on the basis that, even though he had misstated his nationality to gain possession of a British passport, until it expired this entitled him to British diplomatic protection in Germany, and therefore he owed allegiance to the King of England at the time he commenced working for the Germans. Joyce was convicted and sentenced to death on September 19, 1945.\n\nBy 1946, it became clear to the United States that the Soviet Union did not share the American vision of postwar collaboration for peace in Europe. Soviet authorities began to install Communist regimes in liberated territories of Eastern Europe, a direct violation of the provisions in the Teheran and Yalta Conferences. The radio became crucial in the propaganda war between the two blocs and was the main concern of both participants’ information agencies as the “war of ideas” began. In 1948, the Soviet Union organized the Communist Information Bureau (Cominform), which was formed to unite the Communist states in forthcoming struggle against “Anglo-American Imperialism.” \n\nOne of the earliest responses in Europe was known as Radio in the American Sector (RIAS). RIAS was established in 1946 to serve the American sector in West Berlin. The station's importance was magnified during the 1948 Berlin blockade, when it carried the message of Allied determination to resist Soviet intimidation. In East Germany, broadcasts included news, commentary, and cultural programs that were unavailable in the controlled media of the German Democratic Republic. The management of RIAS developed many of the techniques later used to develop Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty. The RIAS broadcasts concentrated on the idea of democracy and the importance of the breakdown of the international communications barriers erected by the Communists. The programming was generally geared towards “special groups” within the East German population, including youth, women, farmers, etc. The broadcast became known as the “bridge” from West to East Germany over the Berlin Wall.\n\nAside from RIAS, Voice of America (VOA) began broadcasting in 1947 in the Soviet Union for the first time as a part of U.S. foreign policy to fight the propaganda of the Soviet Union and other countries. Initially, there was only one hour per day of news and other features broadcast on the pretext of countering \"more harmful instances of Soviet propaganda directed against American leaders and policies\" on the part of the internal Soviet Russian-language media. The Soviet Union responded by initiating aggressive, electronic jamming of Voice of America broadcasts on April 24, 1949. This led critics to question the broadcasts' actual impact. However, after the collapse of the Warsaw Pact and the Soviet Union, interviews with participants in anti-Soviet movements verified the effectiveness of VOA broadcasts in transmitting information to socialist societies.\n\nWhile many acknowledged the importance of propaganda as an instrument of foreign policy, it was primarily the Cold War that institutionalized propaganda as a permanent instrument of U.S. foreign policy. The Soviets suddenly increased the tempo of the war, by taking over Czechoslovakia and attempting to take complete control of Berlin. Realizing there was no further hope of considering the Soviet Union as an ally, the North Atlantic Treaty Organization was formed in April 1949, establishing the policy of containment of Communism as the organization's priority. The escalation of the Cold War intensified America’s interest in broadcasting and information policy. The world was entering into a new era of foreign relations; therefore, the United States National Security Council produced a study in 1949 that concluded that there was a need for the United States to have a major information program to counter Soviet aggression. The council issued document 10/2, approved by President Truman in June 1948, authorizing a comprehensive program of clandestine warfare, including black propaganda, psychological warfare, subversion, assistance to underground resistance movements, paramilitary operations, and economic warfare. The most famous form of anti-Soviet propaganda was the development of Radio Free Europe (RFE) and Radio Liberty (RL), which broadcast to Eastern Europe. The stations' purpose, above all, was fighting a political mission against Communism and Sovietism, against the representatives of the terrorist regimes. Its job was to mask Communist plans and expose all of those who were propagandist of Communist ideology. While other countries established international broadcasting entities, RFE/RL’s purpose was to change the form of government in foreign nations by airing news not about the country from which the broadcasts originated, but about the countries that were the targets of the broadcasts.\n\nPresident Harry Truman announced in 1950 that the United States would launch an information program known as the “Campaign of Truth.” The name was strategically picked to avoid any connotation of propaganda. The goals of the campaign included:\n\nIn late 1950, RFE/RL began to assemble a full-fledged foreign broadcast staff, becoming more than a \"mouthpiece for exiles.\" Teams of journalists were hired for each language service and an elaborate system of intelligence gathering provided up-to-date broadcast material. Most of this material came from a network of well-connected émigrés and interviews with travelers and defectors. The Communist regimes devoted considerable resources to countering Western broadcasts. They organized radio jamming on a massive scale, spending more on jamming than the West did on broadcasting. They placed spies in Western radio stations in an attempt to disrupt information sharing and organize counterpropaganda, while also attempting to gain access to top level officials who could provide them with information controlled by Western media outlets or intelligence services. These countermeasures by foreign regimes significantly drained domestic resources, and failed to neutralize Western broadcasts.\n\nDuring these years, the practice of propaganda became inextricably tied to the practices of psychological warfare. During World War II, psychological warfare was largely seen as an accessory to military operations, but during the Cold War psychological warfare was utilized to influence public opinion and advance foreign policy interests. Psychological warfare became, in essence, a synonym for the Cold War. It reflected the belief that the Cold War was an ideological, psychological, and cultural contest for hearts and minds that would be won or lost on the plain of public opinion. When President John F. Kennedy took office, his administration had a greater interest in the U.S. information effort than any other president up until that time. With Soviet premier Nikita Khrushchev’s address to the Soviet Central Committee in 1961, U.S. leaders believed the Soviet Union would be ready to seek a more limited form of conflict, emphasizing their winning of hearts and minds. The United States saw this as a good sign to use psychological resources to their advantage. However, these components of propaganda were put on hold with the Bay of Pigs scandal, the Cuban Missile Crisis, and the abrupt end of the Kennedy Administration.\n\nThe first Vietnamese-language radio transmission was made on September 2, 1945, when Ho Chi Minh read out the Declaration of Independence. Prior to 1945, Vietnamese people were banned from owning radio receivers, and broadcasting was under control of the French colonial government, which established the first radio station in Vietnam, Radio Saigon, in the late 1920s. Vietnam's national radio station, now called the Voice of Vietnam, started broadcasting from Hanoi the week after declaration of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, stating, \"This is the Voice of Vietnam, broadcasting from Hanoi, the capital of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam.” During the Vietnam War, Radio Hanoi operated as a propaganda tool of North Vietnam. Following reunification, all radio stations were combined into the Voice of Vietnam, which became the national radio station in 1978.\n\n\"Hanoi Hannah\" or Trịnh Thị Ngọ, was a Vietnamese radio personality best known for her work during the Vietnam War, when she made English-language broadcasts for North Vietnam directed at U.S. troops. During the Vietnam War in the 1960s and 1970s, Ngo became famous among U.S. soldiers for her propaganda broadcasts on Radio Hanoi. She made three broadcasts a day, reading the list of the newly killed or imprisoned Americans, attempting to persuade U.S. GIs that the U.S. involvement in the Vietnam War was unjust and immoral and playing popular U.S. anti-war songs in an attempt to incite feelings of nostalgia and homesickness amongst U.S. troops. Although she used the alias Thu Huong, the GIs usually called her \"Hanoi Hannah\" or \"the Dragon Lady\". Few were believed to have been influenced by her propaganda work and the soldiers often mocked her tactics, but they were also impressed by her military intelligence, especially when she mentioned the location of their own unit or listed specific U.S. casualties. After the war, she returned to live in Ho Chi Minh City with her husband where her voice was better known in the U.S. than in her own country.\n\nThe United States took the lead in broadcasting psychological operations due to its superior technology and its ability to use aircraft to broadcast AM, FM and shortwave radio from directly above target audiences. America had dropped battery or crank-powered radios on third-world nations like Haiti so that the populace could hear U.S. broadcasts. In the more recent struggles in Iraq and Afghanistan, the United States distributed various battery and solar-powered satellite radios so that its story could be heard. The U.S. also dropped leaflets to inform Afghans about the attacks of September 11 and the Taliban, and to infiltrate Iraq with information on anti-Saddam radio programs that would be broadcast.\n\nIn the 2001 invasion of Afghanistan, psychological operations (PSYOP) tactics were employed to demoralize the Taliban and to win the sympathies of the Afghan population. At least six EC-130E Commando Solo aircraft were used to jam local radio transmissions and transmit replacement propaganda messages even before the United States invaded Afghanistan. The primary PSYOP objectives were used to counter adversarial propaganda, to discourage interference with humanitarian affairs activities, to support objectives against state and non-state supporters and sponsors of terrorism, and to disrupt support for and relationships among terrorist organizations. In Afghanistan, the U.S. military has long conducted propaganda campaigns to try to sway public opinion against insurgents. Today (2013), the U.S. is teaching Afghan army units how to counter Taliban propaganda, especially with local radio broadcasts. The idea is to counter the Taliban-sponsored stations, so called \"Mullah Radios,\" that operate mainly in the tribal areas along the Pakistani border and broadcast propaganda that helps turn public opinion against foreign troops and the pro-Western Afghan government. Radio is key to reaching the majority of Afghans; with only limited access to television, newspapers, and the Internet, most depend on radio programs for information.\n\nDuring the Iraq War, the U.S. implemented \"black propaganda\" by creating false radio personalities who disseminated pro-American information, but were supposedly supporters of Saddam Hussein. Radio Tikrit was a radio station in Iraq that broadcast programs that reflected strong support for the Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein and his government. The station's name is also the name of the Iraqi town where Saddam and other members of his government were born. However, the tone of Radio Tikrit's programs began to change dramatically; one show reportedly described Iraqis as being so poor that they had to sell their windows and doors. Another broadcast reported to have encouraged Iraqi soldiers to refuse the \"orders of the tyrant\" and to \"be brave before it is too late,” suggesting that the United States may have infiltrated the station. The U.S. was also successful with the Voice of America efforts once the censorship of the Iraqi media was lifted with the removal of Saddam from power.\n\nVoice of America, The Voice, or VOA is the official external broadcast institution of the United States federal government, sponsoring programming for broadcast on the radio, television, and the Internet outside of the U.S. in 43 languages. Currently, VOA produces about 1,500 hours of news and feature programming each week to global audience in order, \"to promote freedom and democracy and to enhance understanding through multimedia communication of accurate, objective, and balanced news, information and other programming about America and the world to audiences overseas.\" Under § 501 of the Smith–Mundt Act of 1948, the Voice of America was forbidden to broadcast directly to American citizens until July 2013 when it was repealed in the \"Smith-Mundt Modernization Act\" provision of the National Defense Authorization Act for 2013. The intent of the legislation was to protect the American public from propaganda actions by its own government.\n\nOn July 12, 1976, the principles were signed into law by President Gerald Ford:\n\nToday, the VOA operates shortwave radio transmitters and antenna farms at one site in the United States close to Greenville, North Carolina. The 44 languages that Voice of America currently broadcasts in include (TV broadcasts are marked with an asterisk):\nFrom 1942 to 1945, VOA was part of the Office of War Information, from 1945 to 1953, a function of the State Department, and in 1953 it was placed under the U.S. Information Agency. When the USIA was abolished in 1999, the VOA was placed under the Broadcasting Board of Governors (BBG), where the control remains today. The BBG was established as a buffer to protect VOA and other U.S.-sponsored, non-military, international broadcasters from political interference.\n\nIn 1994, Voice of America became the first broadcast-news organization to offer continuously updated programs on the Internet in English and 44 other languages, using more than 20,000 servers across 71 countries. Since many listeners in Africa and other areas still receive much of their information via radio and have only limited access to computers, VOA continues to maintain regular shortwave-radio broadcasts.\n\nRadio Free Europe/Radio Liberty is a broadcaster funded by the United States Congress that provides news, information, and analysis to countries in Eastern Europe, Central Asia, and the Middle East \"where the free flow of information is either banned by government authorities or not fully developed\". RFE/RL is supervised by the Broadcasting Board of Governors, alongside Voice of America.\n\nFounded as an anti-Communist propaganda source during the Cold War, RFE/RL was headquartered in Munich, Germany, from 1949 to 1995. In 1995, the headquarters were moved to Prague in the Czech Republic, where operations have been significantly reduced since the end of the Cold War. In addition to the headquarters, the service maintains 20 local bureaus in countries throughout their broadcast region, including a corporate office in Washington, D.C. RFE/RL broadcasts in 28 languages to 21 countries including Russia, Iran, Afghanistan, Pakistan, and Iraq.\n\nRFE/RL was developed out of a belief that the Cold War would eventually be fought by political rather than military means. American policymakers such as George Kennan and John Foster Dulles acknowledged that the Cold War was essentially a “war of ideas”. The United States, acting through the Central Intelligence Agency, funded a long list of projects to counter the Communist appeal in Europe and the developing world. The missions of Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty were separate from Voice of America in the sense that VOA was meant to be the voice of America, reflecting American foreign policy and disseminating world news from an official American viewpoint, whereas RFE/RL has the mission of captivating people and stimulating non-cooperation in Communist countries.\n\n\n"}

At this congress the socialist leaders rejected both cooperation and anarchism, both of which would allow the existing regime to continue, and adopted a program based on collectivism. The congress also adopted a motion that women should have equal rights to men, but several delegates felt that essentially woman's place was in the home. The congress has been called a triumph of Guesdism and the birthplace of French Marxist socialism, but both claims are open to question.\nThe attendees soon split into rival groups with disparate beliefs.\n\nThe Third Socialist Workers' Congress was held in Marseille on 20–31 October 1879.\nIt was held in the Salle des Folies-Bergères.\nThe Marseilles Congress followed the Congress of Lyon of 1878, and was the most important socialist congress in France before 1889 in terms of attendance, resolutions and its effect on the socialist party's constitution.\nThe congress was followed by the 1880 Congress of Le Havre.\n\nJules Guesde was a former anarchist who had converted to Marxism in 1876.\nGuesde was sick and bedridden in Paris at the time of the congress, but was represented by two jewelry workers, Jean Lombard of Marseille and Eugène Fournière of Paris.\nA motion composed by Guesde was moved by the delegates from Paris and carried by a large majority.\nIt was:\n\nThe congress adopted a Marxist program and supported collectivism by 73 votes to 27.\nThe collectivists rejected efforts to found cooperatives as being petty bourgeois and covert capitalism.\nThe delegates were also opposed to cooperation and to anarchism, both of which left the status quo undisturbed, and declared themselves in favor of political action.\nThe congress has been described as a triumph of Guesdism, but in fact was a triumph of collectivism, which Guesde's opponents Paul Brousse and Benoît Malon also supported.\n\nThe suppression of the Paris Commune in 1871 was a severe blow to socialism in France, and for several years afterwards workers were reluctant to get involved in politics.\nAt the congresses of Paris (1876), Lyon (1878) and Marseille (1879) only working men could speak and vote, and discussion of politics was banned.\nHowever Guesde wanted to organize a political party.\nHe claimed that unlike conventional parties the new party would serve the interests of the workers rather than the ambitions of the party leaders.\nThe congress decided that the proletariat should separate itself from all the bourgeois parties and form a new party.\nAt first the party represented artisans such as hatters and shoemakers, but not weavers, miners or foundry workers.\nThe new party had to compete for the attention of the workers with the Blanquists, the Anarchists, after 1881 with the Possiblists, and after 1890 with the Allemanists.\n\nAlthough the launch of the Parti Ouvrier (Party of Labour) by the 1879 congress has been treated by socialist and communist historians as the date when Marxist socialism was born in France, the new \"party\" was a loosely defined movement dominated by anti-political anarchists and anti-socialist radicals, with few members with recognizably Marxist views. It was only between the congress and the 1882 split that Guesde and Lafargue developed hardline Marxist positions.\nThe party suffered from internal disagreements from the start.\nAnarchists such as Jean Grave disliked political involvement of any type, while Brousse was suspicious of Guesde's Marxist authoritarianism and thought the nationalization program would lead to a socialist dictatorship.\n\nSome of the delegates defended the concept of the family wage, and argued against women's wage labour.\nOne delegate said \"woman's place is in the home, where so many daily concerns call her, and not in a factory or workshop ... The young girl should never learn any trade except those which, later, when she has become a wife and a mother, she can carry out in the home.\"\nIsidore Finance, who represented the building painters of Paris, urged \"tough-fisted and hardheaded workingmen ... to demand a wage that is not simply the equivalent to the product of their labours, but sufficient to keep women and the aged at home.\"\n\nHubertine Auclert made passionate pleas for women's rights, but argued that they needed economic independence due to their \"natural\" motherhood.\nAuclert was on a special committee to consider the equality of women, and was given an hour to speak to the congress on this subject.\nAfter her speech she was invited to head a committee to prepare a statement on women's rights.\nThis statement, which said women should have the same social, legal, political and working rights as men was approved by the congress.\n\n"}
{"id": "39083351", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=39083351", "title": "Steering tax", "text": "Steering tax\n\nA steering tax (Often an \"Ecological incentive tax\") is a tax which aims to change the behaviour of the tax payer, as defined by lawmakers, and not particularly to increase tax revenue. The term is not sharply definable because many tax related laws influence buyer behaviour which is not always a wanted effect (compensation reaction). The Pigovian tax is a special case of a steering tax to avoid negative Externality. An ecological tax reform is often understood to refer to the introduction of a steering tax on energy use, according to the Polluter pays principle.\n\nIn other languages incentive taxes (or fees) are known as \"\"\" or \"Lenkungs-Steuer\"\" (Switzerland). Some of the eco-taxes (\"Ökosteuer\") in Germany and Austria are also steering taxes, in the sense of the originally intended Eco-social market economy.\n\nThe vehicle Excise Duty in Germany is an example of a steering tax. It is formulated in such a way that there is an incentive to invest in a new car which is as low polluting as possible. Cars with larger pollutant emissions pay a high tax compared to less polluting cars. Electric cars are tax free. In Germany and Switzerland it is legally clarified that the tax revenues should be used to promulgate, or \"steer\", the targeted behaviour change. The increase of earnings may be as long secondary aim as the rule has an objective earning relevance. This means that the tax may be as long be valid as a tax earning can be expected to take place and therefore the steering effect is justified.\n\nIf the aim of steering the payer's behaviour is successful, this means that the aim to increase tax revenues will be unsuccessful. The yield of tax revenue is reduced if the tax payers behave in the targeted way. For example, the consumption of cigarettes was quickly significantly reduced in Germany in 2004 by the increase of the tobacco tax.\n\nThere are also steering taxes like the (\"Incentive Tax on Volatile Organic Compounds\"),\n\nwhich will be completely distributed amongst the population.\nIn this case there is no aim to increase tax revenues at all. The ideal goal of such a refund is the creation of positive incentives: People will be rewarded when they behave in the wanted way. If, for example they reduce the emission of greenhouse gases or environmentally dangerous pollutants and reduce their Ecological footprint, they get back an ecological bonus (German: \"Ökobonus\"), because with the consumption of non-taxed environmentally friendly products, they pay less eco-taxes than the Green-Cheque is per capita: The amount of the eco-bonus is independent from the energy consumption of the individual recipients. In the words of a publication of the European Environment Agency: “A Swiss study (INFRAS/ECOPLAN, 1998), which investigated the economic and social impacts of different energy tax schemes, showed that redistributing revenues in the form of a \"per capita bonus\" is the most progressive option for an Environmental-tax-reform and creates the most beneficial social effects, although it leads to slightly negative effects on economic development.”\nThe repayment of steering taxes is often named fiscal subsidy. If this is accurate depends if one believes a steering tax is used solely as a direct transfer of public funds to private persons, or if they are seen as a relinquishment of state earnings to realize Fiscal neutrality for this market-based environmental policy instrument. The official wording of the German federal government for such a revenue abstinence is \"subsidy related matters of fact\".\n\n“The recycling [or redistribution of steering tax-] revenues is especially important for the acceptability, and equity of the tax reforms.” But a difficulty for the political system is, that Opinion polls have shown that the redistribution aspect of eco-taxes “is very poorly understood by a large majority of the population.“\n\n"}

This is held in contrast to the method of distribution and compensation in capitalism, where those who own private property receive unearned income in the form of interest, rent, or profit by virtue of ownership irrespective of their contribution to the social product.\n\nThis concept also formed the basic definition of socialism for its pre-Marxist proponents, including Ricardian socialists, classical economists, and individualist anarchists.\n\n\"To each according to his contribution\" was a concept espoused by many members of the socialist and labor movement. Examples of this can be found from Ferdinand Lassalle's and Eugen Dühring's statements to Leon Trotsky's writings. However, it was Vladimir Lenin, inspired by Marx's writing on the subject in his \"Critique of the Gotha Programme\", who claimed the principle to be a fundamental element of socialism within Marxist theory.\n\nLibertarian socialist thinkers, such as American anarchist Benjamin Tucker, defined socialism as a system whereby the laborer receives the full product of his labor through the elimination of exploitation and accrual of unearned income to a capitalist class.\n\nThe term means simply that each worker in a socialist society receives compensation and benefits according to the quantity and value of the labor that he or she contributed. This translates into workers of high productivity receiving more wages and benefits than workers of average productivity, and substantially more than workers of low productivity. An extension of this principle could also be made so that the more difficult one's job is—whether this difficulty is derived from greater training requirements, job intensity, safety hazards, etc.—the more one is rewarded for the labor contributed. The purpose of the principle, as Trotsky would later state, is to promote productivity. This is done by creating incentives to work harder, longer, and more productively. The principle is ultimately a stowaway from capitalism that, according to Marx, will vanish as work becomes more automated and enjoyable, and goods become available in abundance.\n\nThe principle has its roots in the way that capitalism manages its affairs. That is, each is rewarded according to how much he produces. Remuneration increases as the amount of labor contributed increases. However capitalism can lead to a situation where the means of production are owned by a small minority who do not produce, but rather live off the labor of others. Socialism is said to remedy this by putting the means of production in common hands and rewarding individuals according to their contributions.\n\nIn the \"Critique of the Gotha Programme\", while criticizing Lassalle's ideas, Marx elaborates on the theory. According to Marx's analysis of the Programme, Lassalle suggests that \"the proceeds of labor belong undiminished with equal right to all members of society\". While agreeing that the citizens of a workers' society should be rewarded according to individual contributions, Marx claims that giving them the \"full product\" of their labor is impossible as some of the proceeds will be needed to maintain infrastructure and so forth. He then explains the nature of a communist society in its lower phase (\"socialist society\"), which does not emerge from its own foundations \"but, on the contrary, just as it emerges from capitalist society; which is thus in every respect, economically, morally, and intellectually, still stamped with the birthmarks of the old society from whose womb it emerges\". And so, \"accordingly, the individual producer receives back from society — after the deductions have been made — exactly what he gives to it\". He explains this as: \n\nIn the paragraph immediately following Marx continues to explain how this system of exchange is related to the capitalist system of exchange:\nMarx says that this is rational and necessary, and that once society advances from the lower phase of communist society and work becomes life's prime want, distribution will occur along different lines. During the higher phase of communism, the standard shall be \"from each according to his ability, to each according to his needs\".\n\nLenin wrote \"The State and Revolution\" to answer all the burning questions of the movement, and to prevent Marxism from becoming tainted by \"opportunists\" and \"reformists\", as he called them. The work is very important as it categorizes the \"first phase of communist society\" as socialism, with the higher phase being communism proper. The pamphlet also answers all questions and concerns of the Marxists of his time by utilizing the classic works of Marxism.\n\nWhen he is set to describe socialism and its economic features he turns to the authority of Marx, especially the \"Critique of the Gotha Programme\". Lenin claims that socialism will not be perfect since, as Marx said, it has emerged from the womb of capitalism and which is in every respect stamped with the birthmarks of the old society. This society, socialism, will be unable to provide people with total equality, precisely because it is still marked by capitalism. He also explains the difference between the old society and the new as: \n\nLenin states that such a society is indeed socialism as it realizes the two principles of socialism \"he who does not work, neither shall he eat\" and \"an equal amount of products for an equal amount of labor\".\n\nJoseph Stalin and Leon Trotsky both mentioned the term in their works.\n\n\n"}

The group was formed in 1953 by combining a selection process for council candidates backed by several civic interest groups and lobby groups opposed to a proposed sewerage scheme. Its main ambition was to control the balance of power on the Auckland City Council and stop the sewerage scheme.\n\nThe United Independents group traces its origins back to a group of grassroot locals voicing their opposition to a council proposal to discharge Auckland's sewage into Waitemata Harbour, known as the 'Brown's Island' scheme. Lobbying tactics proved ineffective to stopping the scheme and so opponents turned to political action in order to dissuade local politicians. The most noted public opponent to Brown's Island, Dove-Myer Robinson, used his local renown from the issue and won an Auckland City Council by-election in 1952 and thereby gained membership to the Auckland Metropolitan Drainage Board and continued to criticize Brown's Island from within.\n\nIn the lead up to the 1953 municipal elections he helped form the United Independents, candidates who were independent of each other on all issues except Brown's Island on which they were all united. The United Independents won five seats and held the balance of power between the long established Citizens & Ratepayers and Labour Party tickets. The United Independents also endorsed John Luxford's candidacy for Auckland's Mayoralty. Luxford defeated incumbent Mayor John Allum, who was a supporter of the Brown's Island scheme. By allowing the Citizens & Ratepayers to appoint their preferred candidates to committee chairmanships they desired, the United Independents were in turn able to seize control of the Drainage Board and halt Brown's Island development. The United Independents then proposed an alternative scheme for oxidation ponds to be built in Manukau Harbour near Mangere which would break down the sewage naturally, a new technique pioneered in California, which was approved.\n\nThe 1956 municipal elections had less success for the United Independents. The group had fallen out with Luxford, who now stood for the Citizens & Ratepayers Association. The United Independents viewed Luxford as a traitor and gave their endorsement to Auckland's former Town Clerk Thomas Ashby, who defeated Luxford. However the United Independents themselves fared less successfully, losing two seats on the council and their hold on the balance of power. Further setbacks occurred when Ashby died suddenly. The United Independents did not contest the ensuing Mayoral by-election which saw Citizens & Ratepayers candidate Keith Buttle defeat Labour's John Stewart.\n\nBy 1959 the United Independents had merged with the Labour ticket and jointly contested that years municipal elections under the new Civic Reform banner. Robinson successfully contested the Mayoralty as an Independent, with informal support from Civic Reform.\n\n"}
