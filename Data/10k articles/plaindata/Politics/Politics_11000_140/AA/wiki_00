Since 1999 the Day of Unity of Ukraine, celebrated every year on January 22 to mark the signing of the treaty, is a state holiday; but not a public holiday.\n\nThe agreement was aimed at creating a unified Ukrainian state, a movement long-awaited by the intelligentsia on both sides. However, the Act Zluky was regarded as purely symbolic in that both governments still retained their own separate armies, administrations and government structure.\n\nThe text of the universal made by the Directorate of the Ukrainian People's Republic:\nThe territory of Ukraine, divided over the centuries, including Galicia, Bukovyna, Carpathian Ruthenia, and Dnieper Ukraine will now become a great united Ukraine. Dreams, for which the best sons of Ukraine fought and died for, have come true.\nAccording to the treaty Galicia would become an autonomous part of Ukraine.\n\nHowever Ukraine was unable to gain independence and in December 1920 the Ukrainian SSR of the Soviet Union was established comprising most the territory of the Ukrainian People's Republic. The territories of the West Ukrainian People's Republic became mostly part of Poland. In 1939 the territories of both became part of the Ukrainian SSR.\nTo mark the 71st anniversary of the signing of the Act Zluky in 1990, over 300,000 Ukrainians created a human chain (approx. ) from the capital Kiev to the western Ukrainian city of Lviv on January 21, 1990. The chain, the largest public demonstration in Ukraine since the beginning of Glasnost, was funded by the People's Movement of Ukraine (\"Rukh\") and was partly inspired by the Baltic Way which had taken place the previous year. Also, for the first time since the period of the Ukrainian People's Republic, the blue and yellow national flag was raised.\n\nOn January 21, 1999, the President of Ukraine Leonid Kuchma decreed the \"Day of Reunion of Ukraine\" (), a government holiday, celebrated every year on January 22 to mark the political and historical significance of the 1919 agreement. It is not a public holiday. In December 2011, President Viktor Yanukovych caused public controversy when he merged the \"Day of Freedom\" into this day, naming it officially the \"Day of Unity and Freedom of Ukraine\" (Ukrainian: День Соборності та Свободи України, \"Den’ Sobornosti ta Svobody Ukrayiny\"). The \"Day of Freedom\" was created in 2005 by President Viktor Yushchenko, Yanukovych's opponent, to be celebrated on November 22 in commemoration of the Orange Revolution. President Yanukovych stated he changed the day of celebration because of \"numerous appeals from the public\". Mid-October 2014 President Petro Poroshenko undid Yanukovych's merging when he decreed that November 21 will be celebrated as \"Day of Dignity and Freedom\" in honour of the Euromaidan-protests that started on November 21, 2013.\n\n\n"}

Professor Bartlett had lectured over 1,742 times since September, 1969 on \"Arithmetic, Population, and Energy\". Bartlett regarded the word combination \"sustainable growth\" as an oxymoron, since even modest annual percentage population increases will inevitably equate to huge exponential growth over sustained periods of time. He therefore regarded human overpopulation as \"The Greatest Challenge\" facing humanity.\n\nBartlett received a B.A. in physics at Colgate University (1944), and an A.M. (1948) and Ph.D. (1951) in physics at Harvard University. Bartlett joined the faculty at the University of Colorado at Boulder in September 1950. In 1978 he was national president of the American Association of Physics Teachers. He was a fellow of the American Physical Society and of the American Association for the Advancement of Science. In 1969 and 1970 he served two terms as the elected chair of the four-campus faculty council at the university. He won the Robert A. Millikan award.\n\nProfessor Bartlett often explained how sustainable growth is a contradiction. His view was based on the fact that a modest percentage growth will equate to huge escalations over relatively short periods of time.\n\nBartlett argued that, over time, compound growth can yield enormous increases. For example, an investor earning a constant annual 7% return on their investment would find his or her capital doubling within 10 years. But the same exponential power, so advantageous to patient investors, may be potentially calamitous when applied to human population. A population of 10,000 individuals, if it were to grow at a constant rate of 7% per annum, would reach a population size of 10 million after 100 years.\n\nBartlett regarded the failure to understand the laws of the exponential equation as \"The Greatest Challenge\" facing humanity, and promoted sustainable living and was an early advocate on the topic of overpopulation. He opposed the cornucopian school of thought (as advocated by people such as Julian Lincoln Simon), and referred to it as \"The New Flat Earth Society\"\n\nJ. B. Calvert (1999) has proposed that Bartlett's law will result in the exhaustion of petrochemical resources due to the exponential growth of the world population (in line with the Malthusian Growth Model).\n\nBartlett made two notable statements relating to sustainability:\n\n\"The greatest shortcoming of the human race is our inability to understand the exponential function.\"\nand his \"Great Challenge\":\n\n\"Can you think of any problem in any area of human endeavor on any scale, from microscopic to global, whose long-term solution is in any demonstrable way aided, assisted, or advanced by further increases in population, locally, nationally, or globally?\"\nBartlett died on September 7, 2013.\n\n\nBartlett's work has been highly influential. As one example, his work on exponential growth and population is referred to in depth in the \"Crash Course\" created by Chris Martenson and his organisation Peak Prosperity.\n\nIn August 2013 (the month before Prof. Bartlett's death), the Environmental Center at the University of Colorado at Boulder offered training on giving his presentation; the team \"came together because they believe so strongly in Dr. Bartlett's message and want to ensure it continues to be delivered well into the future\".\n\n\n\n"}

The definition of rightists was not always consistent, sometimes including critics to the left of the government, but officially referred to those intellectuals who appeared to favor capitalism and were against collectivization. The campaigns were instigated by Chairman Mao Zedong and saw the political persecution of an estimated 550,000 people.\n\nThe Anti-Rightist Campaign was a reaction against the Hundred Flowers Campaign which had promoted pluralism of expression and criticism of the government, even though initiation of both campaigns was controlled by Chairman Mao and were integrally connected. Going perhaps as far back as the Long March there had been resentment against \"rightists\" inside the CPC, for example, Zhang Bojun.\n\nThe first wave of attacks began immediately following the end of the Hundred Flowers movement in July 1957. By the end of the year, 300,000 people had been labeled as rightists, including the writer Ding Ling. Future premier Zhu Rongji, then working in the State Planning Commission, was purged in 1958. Most of the accused were intellectuals. The penalties included informal criticism, hard labor, and in some cases, execution.\n\nOne main target was the independent legal system. Legal professionals were transferred to other jobs; judicial power was exercised instead by political cadres and the police.\n\nThe second part of the campaign followed the Lushan Conference of July 2 – August 16, 1959. The meeting condemned General Peng Dehuai, who had criticised the Great Leap Forward.\n\nAfter Mao's death, many of the convictions were revoked in 1979. At that time, under leader Deng Xiaoping, the government announced that it needed capitalists' experience to get the country moving economically, and subsequently the guilty verdicts of thousands of counterrevolutionary cases were overturned — affecting many of those accused of rightism and who had been persecuted for that crime the previous twenty two years. This came despite the fact that Deng Xiaoping had been one of the most enthusiastic prosecutors of the movement during the \"First Wave\" of 1957.\n\nIn 2009, leading up the 60th anniversary of the PRC's founding, a number of media outlets in China listed the most significant events of 1957 but downplayed or omitted reference to the Anti-Rightist Movement. Websites were reportedly notified by authorities that the topic of the movement was extremely sensitive.\n\n\n\n"}

The IPS does not represent indigenous peoples or their organizations, but assists those organizations in presenting their causes, and helps to disseminate information among them.\nIPS was established in 1994 under the auspices of the Arctic Environmental Protection Strategy (AEPS). It was around the same time that the category of Permanent Participants was being developed and applied to the three indigenous peoples’ organizations then observers in the AEPS. When the Arctic Council was established in 1996, both the Permanent Participants and IPS was reinserted into the new intergovernmental framework. Since commencing business in 1994, the role of the secretariat has been to facilitate contributions from the Permanent Participants to the cooperation of the eight Arctic states and to assist the Permanent Participants in performing, mainly communicational task.\n\nThe Arctic Council Indigenous Peoples’ Secretariat is a support Secretariat for the International Indigenous Peoples’ Organizations that have Permanent Participant status in the Arctic Council. IPS assists with creating opportunities for the Indigenous Peoples’ Organizations to present their causes, and helps provide them with necessary information and materials.\nIPS work includes:\n\n• Ensuring that Permanent Participants are sent documents and reports connected to the work of the Arctic Council and its working groups.\n\n• Helping Permanent Participants to present their views to the Arctic Council and its Working Groups.\n\n• Collecting and communicating information about the Arctic Council and its results to the Indigenous Peoples in the various parts of the Arctic.\n\n• Providing co-ordination for the Indigenous Peoples’ Organizations to meet with each other, and to participate in the Arctic Council Working Groups.\n\nA Governing Board, chosen from among the six indigenous peoples' groups that are permanent participants, directs the work of IPS and approves its annual work agenda. Permanent participants choose the Chair of the Governing Board, a position that rotates among the six indigenous groups. The current Chair, Ethel Blake, representing Gwich'in Council International, assumed the two-year post in 2017; the previous incumbent was Tommy Pedersen of the Saami Council, who had held the post since 2009.\nThe working language for meetings of the IPS is English; official communications, however, are published in both English and Russian. The Executive Secretary, currently Elle Merete Omma, is responsible for daily operations and for directing IPS staff. Workplace rules and regulations, as well as accounting and auditing procedures, follow Danish law.\n\nThere are six indigenous peoples organizations covering the Arctic, they all have status of permanent participants in the Arctic Council]\n\nThe Aleut International Association represents Aleut on the Russian and American Aleutian, Pribilof and Commander Islands. It is an Alaska Native not-for-profit corporation, 501(c)(3), registered in the State of Alaska, United States of America, in 1998. AIA was formed by the Aleutian/Pribilof Islands Association, U.S., one of the thirteen regional not-for-profit Alaska Native corporations created as a result of Alaska Native Settlement Claims Act in 1971, and the Association of the Indigenous Peoples of the North of the Aleut District of the Kamchatka Region of the Russian Federation (AIPNADKR). AIA is governed by a Board of Directors composed of four Alaskan and four Russian Aleuts under the leadership of a president. The current president is Mr. Michael Zacharof of Saint Paul Island, Alaska, U.S. The Executive Director is Victoria Gofman of Anchorage, Alaska, U.S.The organization was formed to address environmental and cultural concerns of the extended Aleut family whose wellbeing has been connected to the rich resources of the Bering Sea for millennia. Russian and American Aleuts are separated by distances, borders and the International Date Line but united by the great Bering Sea and the North Pacific. Today, not only does the Aleut community share the resources of the region but the environmental problems as well. The need to understand global processes, such as trans-boundary contaminants transport, the impacts of climate change, and the effects of commercial fisheries on the ecosystem of the Bering Sea to name a few, was an impetus in joining in the work of international fora where AIA is actively pursuing collaboration with governments, scientists, and other organizations in developing programs and policies that could improve the wellbeing of the Aleut people and their environment. AIA was admitted as a permanent participant of the Arctic Council in 1998 and was granted Special Consultive Status by the Economic and Social Council of the United Nations in 2004. In addition, AIA is an accredited Non Governmental Organization (NGO) with the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) and the Global Environment Facility (GEF).\n\nThe Arctic Athabaskan Council is an international treaty organization established to represent the interests of United States and Canadian Athabaskan member First Nation governments in Arctic Council fora, and to foster a greater understanding of the common heritage of all Athabaskan peoples of Arctic North America.The founding members of AAC include four Alaskan Athabaskan communities (Chickaloon Village Traditional Council, Healy Lake Traditional Council (Mendas Cha~Ag), Steven Village Tribal Government, Council, Northway Tribal Council)-and three Athabaskan representative bodies on the Canadian side-the Council of Yukon First Nations, representing eleven Yukon First Nations, the Dene Nation, representing 30 First Nations in the Northwest Territories and northern Manitoba, and Métis Nation-Northwest Territories, representing 13 communities in the Northwest Territories. In total, Arctic Athabaskan founding member governments represent approximately 32,000 indigenous peoples of Athabaskan descent residing in Arctic and Sub-Arctic North America. As more member governments from both the United States (Alaska) and Canada join, this number is expected to increase to approximately 40,000.\n\nThe Gwich'in Council International was established as a non-profit organization in 1999 by the Gwich'in Tribal Council in Inuvik, NWT, to ensure all regions of the Gwich'in Nation in the Northwest Territories, Yukon and Alaska are represented at the Arctic Council, as well as to play an active and significant role in the development of policies that relate to the Circumpolar Arctic. GCI has a number of priorities that relate to the environment, youth, culture and tradition, social and economic development and education.The founding members of GCI includes six Alaskan Gwich'in communities (Arctic Village, Chalkyitsik, Fort Yukon, Birtch, Circle and Venetie) two Gwich'in representative bodies in Canada - Vuntut Gwitchin First Nation representing Vuntut Gwitchin in Old Crow, Yukon, and Gwich'in Tribal Council representing four communities in the Beaufort Delta region in the Northwest Territories. In total, the Gwich'in Council International founding members represent approximately 9,000 indigenous peoples of Gwich'in descent. The GCI Secretariat rotates between the Gwich'in Tribal Council in Inuvik, NWT and the Vuntut Gwitchin First Nation in Old Crow, Yukon.\n\nThe Inuit Circumpolar Council is a transnational non-governmental organization representing 150 000 Inuit across the Circumpolar North. The ICC began originally as an Inuit Circumpolar Conference, first held in 1977, and gradually evolved to become a Council in the 10th General Assembly meeting of the Inuit Circumpolar Conference in 2006 in Utqiagvik, Alaska. The ICC represents today four different Inuit regional organizations in Canada, Alaska, Greenland and Russia. The Russian regional Council in Chukotka was opened 2001 and it operates closely with the Yupik Society, which represents Chukotka's Inuit locally and nationally. The ICC Alaska consists of Inuit from the North Slope Borough, Northwest Arctic Borough, the Bering Straits Region, and the Yukon-Kuskokwim Region and the ICC Canada represents the four land-claim regions, namely Inuvialuit, Labrador, Nunavik, and Nunavut. The ICC Greenland differs from the other regional Councils, representing different organisms of the Greenlandic society instead of representing specific area within the country. Members in the Greenlandic ICC are thus NGOs like the women's association, political entities such as Greenland's parliament and political parties and special-interest groups, e.g. Greenland's workers union (SIK). The principal objective of the ICC is to create unity amongst the Inuit to be able to promote their common agenda on the international level. In addition, the ICC stresses the importance of sustainable environmental management in order to preserve the wildlife and biological diversity and recalls the right of Inuit to the natural resources in their traditional areas.\n\nRussian Association of Indigenous Peoples of the North was created in 1990 at the First Congress of Indigenous Peoples of the North. The Association was originally called the \"Association of Peoples of the North of the USSR\" and united 26 indigenous groups of the North Russia. Today, RAIPON unites 41 indigenous groups whose total population is around 250,000 people. These peoples are represented by 34 regional and ethnic organizations that have the authority to represent these groups both in Russia and in the international community. RAIPON is a permanent participant at the Arctic Council. RAIPON is an observer of UNEP Governing Council/Global Ministerial Environment Forum. RAIPON is an observer of World Intellectual Property Organization's Committee on Intellectual Property and Genetic Resources, Traditional Knowledge and Folklore.Aiming to develop new knowledge about the interaction of actors in the High North, conducted by the Norwegian institute for defence Studies with partners and associates.\n\nThe Saami Council is a non-governmental Saami organization (NGO), with member organizations in Finland, Russia, Norway and Sweden. Since its foundation in 1956 the Saami Council has actively dealt with Saami policy tasks.The primary aims of the Saami Council are the promotion of Saami rights and interests in the four countries having Saami population, to consolidate the feeling of affinity among the Saami people, to attain recognition for the Saami as one nation and to promote economic, social and cultural rights of the Saami in the legislation of the four states, Norway, Sweden, Russia and Finland. Saami Council renders opinions and makes proposals on questions concerning Saami people's rights, language and culture.\n\n"}
{"id": "1844012", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1844012", "title": "Burgage", "text": "Burgage\n\nBurgage is a medieval land term used in Great Britain and Ireland, well established by the 13th century. \n\nA burgage was a town (\"borough\" or \"burgh\") rental property (to use modern terms), owned by a king or lord. The property (\"burgage tenement\") usually, and distinctly, consisted of a house on a long and narrow plot of land (Scots: \"toft\"), with a narrow street frontage. Rental payment (\"tenure\") was usually in the form of money, but each \"burgage tenure\" arrangement was unique, and could include services. \n\nAs populations grew, \"burgage plots\" could be split into smaller additional units. (Amalgamation was not so common, until the second half of the 19th century.) \n\nBurgage tenures were usually money based, in contrast to rural tenures which were usually services based. In Saxon times the rent was called a \"landgable\" or \"hawgable\".\n\nBurgage was the basis of the franchise in many boroughs sending members to the unreformed House of Commons before 1832. In these boroughs the right to vote was attached to the occupation of particular burgage tenements. These could be freely bought and sold, and the owner of the tenement was entitled to convey it for the duration of the election to a nominee, who could then vote. Thus by purchasing the majority of the burgages one could acquire the right to nominate the Members of Parliament. Most of the burgage boroughs became pocket boroughs in this way. The practice was abolished by the Great Reform Act 1832 which applied a uniform franchise to all boroughs.\n\nIn medieval England and Scotland, and some parts of the Welsh Marches, burgage plots or burgage tenements were inclosed fields extending the confines of a town, established by the lord of the manor, as divisions of the 'open' manorial fields. The burgesses (equivalents of \"burghers\") to whom these tracts were allotted, as tenants of the enclosed lands, paid a cash rent instead of, as previously, feudal service. In 1207, for instance, Maurice Paynell, the Lord of the Manor of Leeds, granted a charter to 'his burgesses of Leeds' to build a 'new town', and so created the first borough of Leeds, Briggate, a street running north from the River Aire.\n\nThese burgesses had to be freemen: those who were entitled to practise a trade within the town and to participate in electing members of the town's ruling council.\n\nIn the very earliest chartered foundations, predating the Norman Conquest, the burgage plots were simply the ploughland strips of pre-existing agrarian settlements. In towns like Burford in Oxfordshire and Chipping Campden in Gloucestershire, Bromyard in Herefordshire, and Cricklade in Wiltshire, the property on the road frontage extends in a very long garden plot behind the dwelling even today, as English property boundaries have remained very stable. In South Zeal, in Devon, burgage plots were known as \"borough acres\".\n\nThe basic unit of measurement was the perch which was 5.5 yards (5.03 m) and the plots can be identified today because they are in multiples of perches: at Cricklade most were 2 by 12 perches (10.1 by 60.4 m), while at Charmouth in Dorset, a charter of the year 1320 provided plots 4 perches wide and 20 perches long (about 20 by 100 m), giving a typical plot size of half an acre (0.2 hectare), held at an annual rent of 6d.\n\nBurgage grants were also common in Ireland; for example, when the town of Wexford received its royal charter in 1418, English settlers were encouraged into the town and were given burgage plots at a rent of one shilling per year. The term was translated into Irish as \"buiríos\", and the element \"Borris\" survives in many Irish place names.\n\n\n\n\n"}

It was named after then Labour Prime Minister Bill Rowling in the lead-up to the 1975 general election. Members of the campaign publicly signed the \"Citizens for Rowling\" petition warning against a National government led by Muldoon. The campaign was largely organised by David Exel, a former television producer and current affairs interviewer.\n\nCentral to the campaign was a booklet, in the form of a petition, which attacked Muldoon's leadership style, which was stated as being \"divisive\" and \"moving towards factional strife\". Ads were run in major papers around New Zealand asking people to 'stand up and be counted' as supporting Bill Rowling and the campaign. Many offshoot groups were formed, such as Lawyers for Rowling and Clergy for Rowling. Rowling's eldest son, Carl, also joined the campaign.\n\nProminent members of the campaign included:\n\n\nDespite gaining a lot of press for Labour, the campaign did not succeed, with Muldoon launching a public denial of the claims and stating, \"The average chap doesn't want to be told how to vote.\" Labour went on to lose power after the 1975 general election.\n\nThe publication came up again after the controversial decision by Muldoon to appoint Keith Holyoake as Governor-General in 1977. Rowling said that should Labour win the 1978 general election, he would remove Holyoake as Governor-General and openly stated that he would have appointed Sir Edmund Hillary to the post. That was criticised by Muldoon's government, as Hillary had notably backed Labour in the \"Citizens for Rowling\" campaign in 1975. Fellow Citizen Sir Paul Reeves was appointed Governor-General by the Fourth Labour Government in 1985.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "375303", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=375303", "title": "Condominium", "text": "Condominium\n\nA condominium, often shortened to condo, in the United States and in most Canadian provinces, is a type of living space which is similar to an apartment but which is independently sellable and therefore regarded as real estate. It is where the condominium building structure is divided into several units that are each separately owned, surrounded by common areas that are jointly owned. Similar concepts in other English-speaking countries include: strata title in Australia, Malaysia, New Zealand and the Canadian province of British Columbia; commonhold in the United Kingdom and; sectional title in South Africa.\n\nResidential condominiums are frequently constructed as apartment buildings, but there has been an increase in the number of \"detached condominiums\", which look like single-family homes but in which the yards, building exteriors, and streets are jointly owned and jointly maintained by a community association.\n\nUnlike apartments, which are leased by their tenants, condominium units are owned outright. Additionally, the owners of the individual units also collectively own the common areas of the property, such as hallways, walkways, laundry rooms, etc.; as well as common utilities and amenities, such as the HVAC system, elevators, and so on. Many shopping malls are industrial condominiums in which the individual retail and office spaces are owned by the businesses that occupy them while the common areas of the mall are collectively owned by all the business entities that own the individual spaces.\n\nThe common areas, amenities and utilities are managed collectively by the owners through their association, such as a homeowner association.\n\nScholars have traced the earliest known use of the condominium form of tenure to a document from first century Babylon. The word \"\" originated in Latin.\n\nItaly uses \"\", which is simply the modern Italian form of \"condominium\". Both \"condo\" and \"\" are used colloquially in the Canadian Province of Quebec, where the official term is \"\". In France, however, the term is simply \"\", \"co-property,\" and the common areas of these properties are usually managed by a \"\" or \"co-property union\" (\"union\" in the sense of \"association\").\n\nLatin American nations often use the term \"\", literally meaning \"horizontal property\" but abstractly meaning that all owners of the property have equal interest. The word \"\" is also used. However, in Spain the term is \"comunidad de propietarios\" (legal term) and \"comunidad de vecinos\" (popular term for the residents). \n\n\"Condominium\" is a Latin word formed by adding the prefix \"con-\" (\"together\") to the word \"dominium\" (\"domain, property, ownership\"). Its meaning is therefore \"shared property\".\n\nCondominia (the plural of condominium in Latin) originally referred to territories over which two or more sovereign powers shared joint dominion. This technique was frequently used to settle border disputes when multiple claimants could not agree on how to partition the disputed territory. For example, from 1818 to 1846, Oregon Country was a condominium over which both the United States and Great Britain shared joint sovereignty until the Oregon Treaty resolved the issue by splitting the territory along the 49th parallel and each country gaining sole sovereignty of one side.\n\nThe difference between an \"apartment\" complex and condominium is purely legal. There is no way to differentiate a condominium from an apartment simply by looking at or visiting the building. What defines a condominium is the form of ownership. A building developed as a condominium (and \"sold\" in individual units to different \"owners\") could actually be built at another location as an apartment building (the developers would retain ownership and \"rent\" individual units to different \"tenants\"). As a practical matter, builders tend to build condominiums to higher quality standards than apartment complexes because of the differences between the rental and sale markets.\n\nTechnically, a condominium is a collection of individual home units and common areas along with the land upon which they sit. Individual home ownership within a condominium is construed as ownership of only the air space confining the boundaries of the home. The boundaries of that space are specified by a legal document known as a Declaration, filed on record with the local governing authority. Typically, these boundaries will include the wall surrounding a condo, allowing the homeowner to make some interior modifications without impacting the common area. Anything outside this boundary is held in an undivided ownership interest by a corporation established at the time of the condominium's creation. The corporation holds this property in trust on behalf of the homeowners as a group—it may not have ownership itself.\n\nCondominiums have conditions, covenants, and restrictions, and often additional rules that govern how the individual unit owners are to share the space.\n\nIt is also possible for a condominium to consist of single-family dwellings. There are also \"detached condominiums\" where homeowners do not maintain the exteriors of the dwellings, yards, etc. and \"site condominiums\" where the owner has more control and possibly ownership (as in a \"whole lot\" or \"lot line\" condominium) over the exterior appearance. These structures are preferred by some planned neighborhoods and gated communities.\n\nA homeowners association (HOA), whose members are the unit owners, manages the condominium through a board of directors elected by the membership. This exists under various names depending on the jurisdiction, such as \"unit title\", \"sectional title\", \"commonhold\", \"strata council\", or \"tenant-owner's association\", \"body corporate\", \"Owners Corporation\", \"condominium corporation\" or \"condominium association\". Another variation of this concept is the \"time share\", although not all time shares are condominiums, and not all time shares involve actual ownership of (i.e., deeded title to) real property. Condominiums may be found in both civil law and common law legal systems as it is purely a creation of statute. Among other things, the HOA assesses unit owners for the costs of maintaining the common areas, etc. That is, the HOA decides how much each owner should pay and has the legal power to collect that.\n\nThe description of the condominium units and the common areas and any restrictions on their use is established in a document commonly called a \"Master Deed\" (also known as the \"Enabling Declaration\", the \"Declaration of Conditions\", or the \"Condominium Document\"). Among other things, this document provides for the creation of the HOA. Rules of governance for the association are usually covered under a separate set of bylaws which generally govern the internal affairs of the condominium. Condominium bylaws usually establish the responsibilities of the owners' association; the voting procedures to be used at association meetings; the qualifications, powers, and duties of the board of directors; the powers and duties of the officers; and the obligations of the owners with regard to assessments, maintenance, and use of the units and common areas. Finally, a set of rules and regulations providing specific details of restrictions on conduct of unit owners and residents are established by the HOA. These are more readily amendable than the declaration or association bylaws, typically requiring only a vote of the HOA board. Typical rules include mandatory maintenance fees (perhaps collected monthly), pet restrictions, and color/design choices visible from the exterior of the units. Generally, these sets of rules and regulations are made available to residents and or as a matter of public record via a condominium or homeowners association website or through public files, depending on the state and its applicable laws. Condominiums are usually owned in fee simple title, but can be owned in ways that other real estate can be owned, such as title held in trust. In some jurisdictions, such as Ontario, Canada or Hawaii USA, there are \"leasehold condominiums\" where the development is built on leased land.\n\nIn general, condominium unit owners can rent their home to tenants, similar to renting out other real estate, although leasing rights may be subject to conditions or restrictions set forth in the declaration (such as a rental cap for the total number of units in a community that can be leased at one time) or otherwise as permitted by local law.\n\nCondominium ownership is also used, albeit less frequently, for non-residential land uses: offices, hotel rooms, retail shops, private airports, marinas, group housing facilities (retirement homes or dormitories), bare land (in British Columbia)) and storage. The legal structure is the same, and many of the benefits are similar; for instance, a nonprofit corporation may face a lower tax liability in an office condominium than in an office rented from a taxable, for-profit company. However, the frequent turnover of commercial land uses in particular can make the inflexibility of condominium arrangements problematic.\n\nThere are many forms of real estate ownership that are similar to condominiums but not identical.\n\nClassic privately owned detached houses on privately owned lots may be part of a community that has a homeowner's association. Such an association may administer a common park area, for example, or an access road, or architectural standards for the houses.\n\nIn a townhouse complex, multiple physical houses are combined into a single architectural building. Each unit owner owns an identified plot of land and the building affixed to it, but that building is physically part of a larger building that spans lots. There is a continuous roof and foundation and a single wall divides adjacent townhouses. If there is an apartment below not owned by owner of townhouse, then it is not a townhouse, just a bi-level apartment/condominium. Legally, this is very similar to detached houses, but because of the intertwining of interests in the single architectural building, a homeowner's association is required. It would be impractical, for example to replace the roof of just one townhouse. But unlike the condominium, the townhouse complex's HOA owns none of the building or the land under it. It is essentially under contract to the townhouse owners to maintain the parts of the building that are hard to divide. Even the walls between townhouses are usually outside the purview of the HOA, being jointly owned and maintained by the owners of the townhouses on either side. Like the condominium, the townhouse complex often has common areas for roads, parking, clubhouses, and such.\n\nA rowhouse is like a townhouse except that the houses are not physically connected. They are independent structures that simply have no space between them. Technically, they are detached.\n\nA building with multiple residential units may simply be owned in common by multiple people, with each having specific rights to a particular unit and undivided interest in the rest. This is like a condominium, but there is no HOA with legal powers. It is much harder to govern, as the individual unit owners often have to agree unanimously or court intervention is required.\n\nCalifornia statutes recognize three kinds of \"common interest developments\": condominium, townhouse, and community apartment, with the latter being the owned-in-common concept described above.\n\nIn Australia, condominiums are known as \"strata title schemes\" or \"community title schemes\".\n\nOne in eight Canadian households lived in condominium dwellings, colloquially known as \"condos\", mostly located in a few census metropolitan areas according to Statistics Canada Condominiums exist in most parts of Canada though more common in larger cities. They are regulated under provincial or territorial legislation and specific legal details vary from jurisdiction to jurisdiction. In most parts of Canada, they are referred to as Condominiums, except in British Columbia where they are referred to as a \"strata\" and in Quebec where they are referred to as \"syndicates of co-ownership\". The townhouse complex of Brentwood Village in Edmonton, Alberta, was the first condominium development in Canada (registered in 1967).\nWith regular condominiums, the unit owner usually owns the internal unit space and a share of the corporation; the corporation owns the exterior of the building land and common area; in the case of a \"freehold condominium\" the owner owns the land and building and the corporation owns common shared roadways and amenities. The \"Canadian Condominium Institute\" is a non-profit association of condominium owners and corporations with chapters in each province and territory. The \"Condo Owners Association\" COA Ontario is a non-profit association representing condominium owners with divisions across the province and districts within the various municipalities.\n\nApartments (Danish \"ejerlejlighed\", literally \"owner-apartment\") comprise some 5% of Danish homes.\nThey are traded and mortgaged on the same markets as free-standing houses, and are treated legally much like other forms of real estate. Each owner-tenant directly owns his own apartment; the rest of the building and the ground on which it stands is owned jointly by the apartment owners who execute their joint ownership through an \"owner's association\". The expenses of maintaining the joint property is shared \"pro rata\" among the owners.\n\nAnother 5% of Danish homes are in housing cooperatives (Danish \"andelsbolig\"), which occupy a legal position intermediate between condominiums and housing associations. The entire property is legally owned by a non-profit corporation in which the tenants own shares; each share carries the right and duty to lease an apartment from the cooperative. Shares can be bought and sold, but often the cooperative's rules strictly limit the price for which they may change hand. (In contrast, condominiums are traded on a free market). Because the official share prices are often lower than the market value and sellers often retain freedom to select whom to sell to, under-the-table payments are common.\n\nCurrent public policy favors condominiums over housing cooperatives, and recent legislation have aimed at making the latter more condominium-like. For example, since 2005, cooperative shares may be used to secure bank loans. (However, Danish mortgage banks still may not mortgage individual housing cooperative apartments).\n\nIn England and Wales, the equivalent of condominium is commonhold, a form of ownership introduced in September 2004. As of 3 June 2009, there were 12 commonhold residential developments comprising 97 units in England and one commonhold residential development, comprising 30 units, in Wales.\n\n\"Condominium\" is not a term that is widely used in England and Wales. The preferred term is \"block of flats\" with variations for particular circumstances.\n\nCommonhold is a creature of statute and comparatively rare, and condominiums are more likely to be found in the form of leaseholds.\n\nIn English law it is not possible to enforce a positive covenant on successive owners of freehold land, other than to maintain a boundary fence, without creating an elaborate trust. A positive covenant is, broadly, one which involves the expenditure of money to perform.\n\nThis did not create a significant problem until the 1950s, when \"flats\" (where ownership is divided horizontally) first began to appear on the market as more affordable particularly for first-time buyers. Until then flats had been confined to short-term unsaleable tenancies, with varying degrees of statutory rent protection and security of tenure.\n\nIt was soon learned that freehold flats were an unsatisfactory form of ownership because it was not possible to impose essential maintenance requirements. As such, flats became virtually unmarketable because they were an unacceptable form of security to lenders. Thus solicitors, the principal property lawyers in England and Wales in those days, began to use leases instead, where such limitations did not apply.\n\nProgress was haphazard and piecemeal, but over time things became more standard. Improvements became universal as institutional lenders refused to advance money on the security of flats unless certain basic provisions were included. This benefited owners whether or not they borrowed money since purchase was invariably conducted through a solicitor or licensed conveyancer trained to reject leases failing to meet the necessary standards.\n\nDespite these standards, the actual form of leasehold systems is variable. Highly favoured are arrangements where the leases are granted out of a freehold owned by a corporation, itself owned by individual leaseholders. This provides an opportunity for them to participate in the proper management of the block. Again, quality of management is very variable.\n\nThe statute creating commonholds was motivated by a desire to eliminate some of the problems and perceived injustices, such as the commercial exploitation of \"lessees\" by freeholders as their leases began to have too little time left to satisfy lenders. Since most leasehold developments are undertaken by commercial entities, commonholds did not become widespread. There are, however, other statutes in place that give some degree of protection for leaseholders. It is, nevertheless, essential to consider proper legal advice whenever engaged in the purchase of a flat, for the requirements for a fully marketable flat remain complex.\n\nLaw of Property Act 1925, s.153, contains provisions for the \"enlargement\" of leases into freeholds, one of the effects of which is to preserve the enforceability of positive covenants contained in the lease against the resulting freehold. There are clear, but stringent, requirements. Artificial schemes using the provisions to create enforceable positive covenants in freehold blocks of flats were occasionally mooted but never gained currency.\n\nScotland has a separate legal system from England and Wales and is a separate consideration.\n\nIn Finland, a condominium-like arrangement where the ownership of the real estate is assigned to specific apartments (, ) is usually used only with detached or semi-detached houses.\n\nA housing cooperative is a common form of home ownership in Finland. Owning shares that correspond to one apartment in a housing company is generally considered as much \"owning your own home\" as actually directly owning a (single family) house. However, shares are not considered as real estate but as personal property and the co-op can take the possession of the apartment for a term time and evict the tenant or owner because of disturbance or unpaid maintenance fees.\n\nFinnish housing cooperatives are incorporated as (non-profit) limited-liability companies (, ), where one share usually represents one square meter (sometimes ten) of the apartment.\n\nMembership of a condo is obtained by buying the shares on the open market, most often through a real estate agent. No board approval is needed to buy shares. There is usually no requirement for the owner(s) to live in the condo. Owning of apartments for rent is a common form of saving and private investment in Finland.\n\nIn Germany Condominiums are known as \"Eigentumswohnung\" and the most important law considering condominiums is the German Condominium Act (WEG). It's the basis for all legal regulations involving individual freehold ownership, the rights, duties of home owner associations and the management of condominiums. The Act dates back to 1951, but it was re-enacted in 2007. Now home owners are invested with partial legal capacity, which means that the home owner association represents an entity with rights and duties that may include contracts. The right of ownership is divided in the first article of the German Condominium Act into homeownership, individual freehold ownership, part ownership and commonhold ownership. \n\nCondominiums are known as \"private housing estates\" (as opposed to \"public housing estates\") in Hong Kong.\n\nCondominiums (Hungarian: \"társasház\") were formally introduced in 1924. Condominium properties are traded and mortgaged on the same markets as free standing houses, and treated much like other forms of real estate. The condominium acts as a non-profit legal entity maintaining the common areas of the property, and is managed by a representative elected by the owners' convention.\n\nDecisions that involve changes to the terms and conditions, or larger common expenses need to be approved by the convention, where voting power is based on the percentage of property owned.\n\nActually, condominium is a frequent legal form of housing in Hungarian cities where privatization of state or municipality-owned flats were effected mainly in the 1990s.\n\nIn India, condominiums are known as \"Apartment Buildings\" or \"Flats\". Each building consists of multiple floors and flats with different configurations. The most common configurations are \"1-BHK\", \"2-BHK\" and \"3-BHK\" (BHK stands for bedroom-hall-kitchen).\n\nThe association of home owners is usually called a Co-operative Housing Society (CHS) which needs to be registered with the municipal authorities.\n\nIn Israel, condominiums (known \"בתים משותפים\", \"shared houses\" or \"cooperative houses\") are a common form of home ownership. Public housing has historically been organized as subsidized purchase and mortgages in government-constructed condominiums.\n\nIn Italy, the condominium (\"Condominio\") is governed by law, last reformed in 2012. Co-ownership of the common parts of the buildings (such as the stairs, main walls, facades, roof, courtyards) is mandatory: a landlord can not give up the right on common parts for not paying the costs. Each owner's quota in the condominium is expressed in thousandths (\"millesimi\") of the whole; these are used to determine majorities in owners' assemblies (\"assemblee condominiali\").\n\nSee housing cooperative under \"owners association\".\n\nCondominiums (Norwegian \"Eierseksjon\") were formally introduced in 1983. Approximately 19% of Norwegian homes are condominiums, as approximately 50% of the owner-occupied flats and duplexes, approximately 30% of the rowhouses and 2.5% of the detached houses are organised as condominiums.\n\nTitle \"Condominiums\" is not used in Pakistan rather they are called \"Flats\" for average style building while \"Complexes\" for sophisticated and larger buildings. Minimum floors for a building to be classified as \"Flats\" is four, with a requirement for having at least one elevator or lift for buildings upwards of four floors. Almost all have a separate room called the \"Drawing Room\", used for guest entertainment purposes. However, its use as TV room and dining room is common. Another unique feature is the balcony or \"terrace\", which are standard for all flats.\n\nIn the Philippines, condominiums are classified into three types: low-rise, mid-rise, and high-rise. Condos have a special type of ownership title called a CCT - condominium certificate of transfer. Condominiums usually have amenities, like swimming pools, owned parking, a clubhouse and a building for administration. \n\nIn Singapore and Malaysia, \"Condo\" or \"Condominium\" are terms used for housing buildings with some special luxury features like security guards, swimming pools or tennis courts.\n\nIn Singapore, most housings without such features are built by the governmental Housing Development Board (HDB), and such HDB units can be possessed for rent or individually bought from the government. Condominiums and HDB flats make up the overwhelming majority of available residential housing in the country.\n\nIn South Africa, condominiums are known as \"Sectional Title\" properties, and are governed by the Sectional Titles Act No. 95 of 1986. Town-house complexes and many apartment blocks typically have this form of title. The owners of the complex constitute the Body Corporate, and the Body Corporate elects a group of Trustees to manage the day-to-day management of the complex, who often hire a company specialising in complex management, known as a Managing Agent.\n\nIn Spain, condominiums are known as \"comunidad de propietarios\" (legal term) and \"comunidad de vecinos\" (popular term), and are governed by the Ley de Propiedad Horizontal (L.P.H.) which significantly extends the Spanish Civil Code. L.P.H. became the law in 1960 and more than half of the Spanish population lives in condominiums. According to INE, there are almost 840,000 condominiums in Spain which comprise around 9 million habitat buildings.\nOn 1 May 2009, condominiums (\"ägarlägenheter\") became available for the first time under Swedish law. Of the 14,447 newly built apartments completed in 2009, only six were condominiums. A majority of production, 7,723 units, were apartments in housing cooperatives (\"bostadsrättslägenheter\"), the traditional form of owner occupied apartment housing. As of late 2014, there were 955 condominiums total throughout all of Sweden.\n\nCondominiums are known as \"Con-doh\" and almost in Bangkok.\n\nThe first condominium law passed in the United States was in the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico in 1958. In 1960, the first condominium in the Continental United States was built in Salt Lake City, Utah. The legal concept had spread to the United States from Europe via the Caribbean (Puerto Rico and Cuba) but throughout the 1960s it was widely and erroneously reported that the concept had arisen in the United States directly based on an Ancient Roman model. In fact the concept of an estate in the air was antithetical to Roman Law and there is no evidence of an ancient Roman \"condominio\" \n\nSection 234 of the Housing Act of 1961 allowed the Federal Housing Administration to insure mortgages on condominiums, leading to a vast increase in the funds available for condominiums, and to condominium laws in every state by 1969. Many Americans' first widespread awareness of condominium life came not from its largest cities but from South Florida, where developers had imported the condominium concept from Puerto Rico and used it to sell thousands of inexpensive homes to retirees arriving flush with cash from the urban Northern United States.\n\nThe primary attraction to this type of ownership is the ability to obtain affordable housing in a highly desirable area that typically is beyond economic reach. Additionally, such properties benefit from having restrictions that maintain and enhance value, providing control over blight that plagues some neighborhoods.\n\nOver the past several decades, the residential condominium industry has been booming in all of the major metropolitan areas such as Miami, San Francisco, Seattle, Boston, Chicago, Austin, Los Angeles and New York City. However, in recent years, supply within the condo industry has caught up with demand and sales have slowed. It is now in a slowdown phase.\n\nAn alternative form of ownership, popular in parts of the United States but found also in other common law jurisdictions, is housing cooperative, also known as \"company share\" or \"co-op\". A Housing Cooperative is where the building has an associated legal company and ownership of shares gives the right to a lease for residence of a unit. Another form is ground rent (\"solarium\") in which a single landlord retains ownership of the land (\"solum\") but leases the surface rights (\"superficies\") which renew in perpetuity or over a very long term. This is comparable to a civil-law emphyteusis, except that emphyteusis shifts the duties of up-keep and making improvements onto the renter.\n\nIn the United States, there are several different styles of condominium complexes. For example, a garden condominium complex consists of low-rise buildings built with landscaped grounds surrounding them. A townhouse condominium complex consists of multi-floor semi-detached homes. In condominium townhouses, the purchaser owns only the interior, while the building itself is owned by a condominium corporation. The corporation is jointly owned by all the owners, and charges them fees for general maintenance and major repairs. Freehold townhouses are exclusively owned, without any condominium aspects. In the United States this type of ownership is called fee simple.\n\nNew York’s Condominium Act was passed in 1964. The first condominium building was the St. Tropez Condominium in Manhattan built in 1965.\n\n"}

In 2008, the Director of the Mauritius Customs service stated that, during a meeting on April 11, 2008, with government officials, including the Financial Secretary of the Ministry of Finance and Economic Development and Deputy Commissioner of Police, he was told in no uncertain terms that he should remain quiet about the alleged corruption because if it were to become public, it could bring down the current government of Mauritius. In 2013, Dutch dredging group Boskalis has been fined the equivalent of €1000 by a court in Mauritius for making illicit payments to a port official. In February 2016, the outgoing United States ambassador to Mauritius stated that there is so much turmoil at the Independent Commission Against Corruption that it has lost its credibility. In April 2016, the Independent Commission Against Corruption opened an investigation in the recruitment of the director of the Independent Broadcasting Authority (Mauritius). In April 2016, the Independent Commission Against Corruption recommended formal proceedings against the former Minister of the Environment. In May 2016, the representative of Cisco System filed suit against the National Computer Board and executives of the Mauritius Qualifications Authority.

According to Transparency International, which measure the perceived level of public sector corruption and publish the annual Corruption Perception Index (CPI), in 2012, Mauritius scored 57 and is ranked 43rd (of 176) and 3rd in Africa. The CPI rates countries from 0 (\"highly corrupt\") to 100 (\"highly clean\"), reflecting perceived levels of corruption...\n\nIn 2003, the former Housing and Lands Minister was arrested and charged with conspiracy to accept bribes. In 2007, a municipal councilor was stopped on suspicion of trading in influence. In 2016, Alentaris selected the candidates for the job of director of the Independent Broadcasting Authority. The president of the Independent Broadcasting Authority, who was a member of the political party in power, was hired as director. In 2017, a newspaper uncovered the questionable practice of the director of the Independent Broadcasting Authority to solicit USD 15 000 from investors for each project which required the collaboration of a government ministry.\n\n"}
{"id": "12523064", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=12523064", "title": "Cyrus S. Ching", "text": "Cyrus S. Ching\n\nCyrus S. Ching (May 21, 1876 – December 27, 1967) was a Canadian-American who became an American industrialist, federal civil servant, and noted labor union mediator. He was the first director of the Federal Mediation and Conciliation Service (FMCS) and the Wage Stabilization Board.\n\nChing was born on his father's farm in Prince Edward Island, Canada on May 21, 1876. The Chings were of Welsh heritage (the family name was originally spelled Chynge). He was the only boy in a family with eight children.\n\nChing was educated in a one-room schoolhouse. When he was 16, he was a spectator in a local courtroom, and the experience inspired him to become a lawyer. He attended Prince of Wales College, a college preparatory academy, after a well-off uncle paid for his high school education. He transferred to a local business college and studied bookkeeping and stenography. In 1895, he left Prince Edward Island to work for an Albertan grain elevator company.\n\nOn October 31, 1899, Ching moved to Boston, Massachusetts, and took a job as a clerk with the West End Street Railway. He became an instructor, teaching motormen how to operate the new elevated rail cars. In 1901, Ching was nearly electrocuted on the job while repairing a rail car. Although he was expected to be blind and his face heavily scarred for life, he left the hospital after two months with only minimal scar damage to his hands. Since Massachusetts had yet to enact worker's compensation protection, Ching was fired by the company during his hospitalization. Afterward, however, the company rehired him—this time as a manager, training motormen on the city's streetcars. \n\nChing became a naturalized American citizen in 1909. In 1912, he obtained his law degree from the Evening Institute for Younger Men (now Northeastern University). The same year, he married the former Anna MacIntosh. After her death, Ching married Mildred Vergosen.\n\nWhile working for the public transit system, Ching witnessed the 1912 Boston streetcar strike. Ching had warned management that 11 years of frozen wages, lack of communication and general disregard for workers' issues would lead to a strike. Management refused to heed his warnings. In June 1912, the Amalgamated Association of Street Car Employees struck the transit system. The Mayor of Boston, John \"Honey Fitz\" Fitzgerald, and the Governor of Massachusetts, Eugene Foss, accused the president of the company of bribing state legislators to obtain favorable treatment. The president resigned, leading to an end to the strike in August 1912. The system's new president appointed Ching as company negotiator. Ching promised to end the use of management spies, which quickly led to a labor agreement. When the American Federation of Labor (AFL) forced the Amalgamated to give up jurisdiction over 34 separate job titles to various craft unions, Ching consented to the change—and negotiated another 34 labor contracts.\n\nWhen the United States entered World War I in 1918, Ching attempted to enlist but was turned down because the military refused to induct anyone taller than 6'4\" (Ching was 6'7\"). Rather than continue to work for the transit company, Ching went to work for the United States Rubber Company in 1919 as director of industrial relations. U.S. Rubber had 34 subsidiary units, most of which were independent. When employees assisted by the Industrial Workers of the World (IWW) engaged in a recognition strike at the company's Dominion Rubber unit in Montreal, Ching convinced both Dominion and U.S. Rubber officials to agree to binding arbitration. The workers subsequently rejected the IWW in favor of affiliating with the AFL. Ching later secured company acquiescence in the formation of workers' councils in every U.S. Rubber factory. Yet Ching opposed widespread unionization of U.S. Rubber due to the AFL's insistence on craft unionism.\n\nUnions began forming in the American rubber industry after passage of the National Industrial Recovery Act in June 1933. Goodyear, B. F. Goodrich, and Firestone all were quickly organized by the AFL. But workers at U.S. Rubber remained by and large satisfied with working conditions, and unionization made little inroad among company employees. Ching, however, saw unionization coming. Although the United Rubber Workers (URW) had made few inroads among the company's workers, Ching met with URW and Congress of Industrial Organizations (CIO) organizers and arranged for card check elections at U.S. Rubber factories. Unionization of the company proceeded without the acrimony observed at other rubber manufacturers, and contracts were quickly signed.\n\nChing's career as a mediator began in 1941. William S. Knudsen, chairman of the National Defense Advisory Commission, asked Ching to mediate a dispute at a Bethlehem Steel factory in upstate New York. When the union struck in February 1941, Bethlehem Steel executives demanded that the governor crush the strike using the New York Army National Guard. Ching not only refused to ask for military intervention, he demanded that Bethlehem Steel executives meet with him in Washington, D.C. At a meeting a few days later, Ching surprised the company by having Philip Murray, president of the United Steelworkers of America, and Sidney Hillman, associate director of the Office of Production Management and a former CIO leader, at the meeting. Ching had won Murray's consent to a quick election at the plant. When the employer claimed the union effort was led by a mere handful of agitators, Ching demanded that the company prove its claim by holding a snap National Labor Relations Board election. Management, its bluff called, reluctantly agreed. An election was held 10 days later which the union won by a vote of 75 percent to 25 percent. The strike ended, and a contract was signed.\n\nPresident Franklin D. Roosevelt named Ching to the National Defense Mediation Board (NDMB) in early 1941. The Board collapsed shortly before the attack on Pearl Harbor after Ching and a majority of the Board's members voted against imposing the union shop on the \"captive mines\". A later panel overturned the ruling in 1942, but Ching continued to espouse a philosophy of consensual collective bargaining rather than government imposition in employer-union relations.\n\nPresident Roosevelt then named Ching to the War Labor Board, the NDMB's successor. He served from February 1942 to September 1943, then returned to U.S. Rubber. Ching retired from the company in August 1947.\n\nPassage of the Taft-Hartley Act over President Harry S. Truman's veto on June 23, 1947, established the Federal Mediation and Conciliation Service as an independent agency. John R. Steelman, Assistant to the President of the United States (the office later became the White House Chief of Staff), asked Ching to head up the new agency. Ching initially refused, but Truman himself asked Ching to direct the new agency in order to forestall congressional opposition to funding the new agency. Ching served until the end of the Truman administration. During his time in office, Ching advised Truman to invoke the Taft-Hartley Act during a strike at the Oak Ridge National Laboratory in December 1947, and mediated several important strikes—including the 1949 steel strike, the 1949 Hawaii dockworkers' strike, and several coal strikes. He also spent much of his time fighting off attempts to put FMCS back under the authority of the United States Department of Labor.\n\nChing took a leave of absence from FMCS in October 1950 to head the Wage Stabilization Board, a Korean War-era agency created in September 1950 to limit wage increases and help stabilize the economy as defense mobilization ramped upward. He was the agency's first director. He quit the Board in April 1951 when President Truman reconstituted the panel, and returned to FMCS.\n\nAfter departing FMCS in September 1952, President Dwight Eisenhower asked Ching to lead a panel which would arbitrate labor disputes at Oak Ridge. Ching agreed, and remained head of the arbitration panel until his death.\n\nCyrus Ching published his memoirs, \"Review and Reflection: A Half Century of Labor Relations,\" in 1953. He received an honorary degree from Bowdoin College the same year. A partial scholarship was endowed in 1956 in honor of Ching at the Cornell University School of Industrial and Labor Relations.\n\nIn 1961, the Dept. of Labor presented Ching with its Award of Merit for his service in labor-management relations.\n\nChing died at his home in Washington, D.C., of a heart attack on December 27, 1967. At his death, AFL-CIO president George Meany noted, \"He contributed as much to the cause of industrial peace and labor-management understanding as any man of his generation.\"\n\nChing was inducted into the Labor Department's Labor Hall of Honor in 1989.\n\n"}

During the conflict, republican paramilitary groups such as the Provisional Irish Republican Army waged a campaign to bring about a united Irish republic.

Farakka Barrage Township is located in Farakka (community development block) in Murshidabad district. Construction was started in 1961 and completed in 1975 at a cost of . Operations began on 21 April 1975. The barrage is about long. The Feeder Canal (Farakka) from the barrage to the Bhagirathi-Hooghly River is about long.\n\nThe barrage was constructed by Hindustan Construction Company. Out of 109 gates, 108 are over the river and the 109th one over the low-lying land in Malda, as a precaution. The Barrage serves water to the Farakka Super Thermal Power Station. There are also sixty small canals which can divert some water to other destinations for drinking purposes etc.\n\nThe purpose of the barrage is to divert of water from the Ganges to the Hooghly River for flushing out the sediment deposition from the Kolkata harbour without the need of regular mechanical dredging. After commissioning the project, it was found that the diverted water flow from the Farakka barrage was not adequate to flush the sediment from the river satisfactorily. In addition, there are regular land/bank collapses in to the Ganga river due to the high level back waters of the Farakka barrage. Substantial high land is already converted into low level river bed causing displacement of huge population. The water diverted from the Farakka barrage is less than 10% of Ganga river water available at Farakka. The Indian government is contemplating to cement line/widen/deepen the Farakka feeder canal to increase the flow.\n\nAs per the treaty between India and Bangladesh, signed in 1996, for sharing of the Ganges water at Farakka, the division is as follows:\n\nThe Ganges is one of the major rivers of the world.

About one third of the total population of Bangladesh and about 50% of the Indian population live in the Ganges basin; 43% of the total irrigated area in the country is also in the Ganges basin and there are about 100 urban settlements with a total population of about 120 million on its banks. As a result, Bangladesh and India have had many debates about how the Farakka Barrage cuts off Bangladesh's water supply and how to share the water. Right from the beginning, this created a concern for Bangladesh as it constitutes the low-lying part of Gangotri. After the completion of the barrage at the end of 1975, it was agreed to run it with specified discharges for a period of 41 days from 21 April to 31 May during the remaining period of the dry season of 1975 under an accord announced as a joint press release on 18 April 1975. But after the assassination of Sheikh Mujibur Rahman on 15 August 1975, relations between the two countries became greatly strained and India continued to withdraw water even after the agreed period. The diversions led to a crisis situation in Bangladesh in the dry season of 1976. In 1977, Bangladesh went to the United Nations and lodged a formal protest against India with the General Assembly of The United Nations, which adopted a consensus statement on 26 November 1976. Talks between the two countries were resumed in December 1976. No consensus was reached.\n\nTwenty years later, in 1996, a 30-year agreement was signed. It did not contain any guarantee clause for unconditional minimum amounts of water to be supplied to Bangladesh or India, nor could the future hydrological parameters taken into account as is always the case when water resources are planned on historic data series. As a result, the agreement is sometimes perceived to be failed by some sections in Bangladesh to provide the expected result. Constant monitoring of the implementation of Negotiations in lean season continue to the present today. In Bangladesh, it is perceived that the diversion has raised salinity levels, contaminated fisheries, hindered navigation, and posed a threat to water quality and public health. Lower levels of soil moisture along with increased salinity have also led to desertification. However, this barrage still has significant effect on the mutual relation of these two neighboring countries.\n\nFarakka barrage has been criticized for the floods in Bihar as it is causing excessive siltation in the Ganga.\n\n"}
{"id": "28700533", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=28700533", "title": "Fatherland League (Norway)", "text": "Fatherland League (Norway)\n\nThe Fatherland League () was a Norwegian right-wing, anti-communist political organisation in the interwar period. Founded in 1925, the movement aimed to unite all centre-to-right forces against the rise of the revolutionary Marxist labour movement. At its peak of popular support and political influence around 1930 it was the single largest mass movement ever organised on the political right in Norway, with an estimated 100,000 members. The movement began to decline through the 1930s, followed by some unsuccessful attempts to gain direct influence as a political party. The Fatherland League was banned and dissolved after the German occupation of Norway in 1940.\n\nBy the initiative of young industrialist Joakim Lehmkuhl, the organisation was co-founded with national hero Fridtjof Nansen and Norway's first Prime Minister Christian Michelsen. Former Prime Minister Jens Bratlie also joined the organisation. The Fatherland League's goal was a national coalition of all centre-to-right \"bourgeoise\" (\"borgerlige\") and nationally minded forces, in opposition to the emerging revolutionary Marxist labour movement. The organisation gained particular support from the Free-minded Liberal Party and the Farmers' Party, while it was met with scepticism by the Conservative Party, and largely rejection by the Liberal Party. The labour movement in turn saw the organisation as a \"seeding ground\" for a fascist movement.\n\nAfter the government crisis of 1926 and continued division among the centre-right parties, a \"Nansen-petition\" was launched by several influential people of different political backgrounds for a national unity government to be led by Nansen, an idea that was eventually endorsed by Nansen himself and by Lehmkuhl. The proposal fell through as Conservative and Liberal politicians reacted coldly to the idea, and quickly came to a new government agreement.\n\nFollowing a strong surge of support and victory for the Labour Party (which had adopted a revolutionary ideology in 1918) in the 1927 parliamentary election, the Fatherland League launched a \"thousand day's election campaign\" towards the 1930 parliamentary election, a period which is considered the most important and successful in the history of the movement. The 1930 election resulted in Labour Party setbacks amid record voter turnouts, which the League assigned to its own credit, a view that was echoed by the Labour Party's Haakon Lie and Halvard Lange. The organisation peaked the same year with around 100,000 members and more than 400 local chapters.\n\nIncreasingly seen as a political rival rather than a unifying force by the centre-right parties, the organisation effectively reorganised into a political party in 1933 after pressure from its young activists. At the same time it launched a more radical political program titled \"A Norwegian program\", and entered into secret, eventually unsuccessful negotiations of a \"national block\" with the Farmers' Party and the Free-minded People's Party (and briefly Nasjonal Samling which dropped out as it did not consider itself a \"borgerlig\" party). Following the onset of the Great Depression, Lehmkuhl and the party developed an economic ideology in part inspired by the American New Deal social program, emphasising a more planned economy. For the 1936 parliamentary election the party contested electoral lists in a few districts, both independently and together with the Free-minded, but did not win any representation.\n\nThe group declined in the late 1930s, partly due to the Labour Party abandoning its revolutionary ideology dating from 1918, and partly as an effect of the Nazi German-friendly attitude exhibited by several of its leading members as segments of the movement came under the influence of Italian fascism and German national socialism. In 1933, in response to the labour movement's long-standing use of uniforms, some of its young members marched in \"greyshirts\" for the first time at a local rally after the uniform had been launched by the party newspaper \"ABC\". While the labour movement's uniforms had been tolerated for years, political use of uniforms was swiftly banned by the Liberal government the day after the rally. After the German invasion of Norway in April 1940, the remnants of the organisation attempted to establish a political alternative against the Quisling regime. The new chairman, Victor Mogens' secret talks and negotiations with the Germans remained unsuccessful. The organisation, like all other parties but Nasjonal Samling, was banned by Reichskommissar Josef Terboven on 25 September 1940.\n\nThe Fatherland League was not reorganised after the war. As the archives of the organisation were burned after its dissolution, limited historical material remains of it despite being the single largest mass movement ever organised on the political right in Norway. Anders Lange, founder of the modern Progress Party was active as the secretary of the organisation in Kristiansand and in Oslo until 1938.\n\n"}
{"id": "33543787", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=33543787", "title": "Financial costs of the American Revolutionary War", "text": "Financial costs of the American Revolutionary War\n\nThe American Revolutionary War inflicted great financial costs on all of the combatants, including the United States of America, France, Spain and Great Britain. France and Great Britain spent 1.3 billion \"livres\" and 250 million pounds, respectively. The United States spent $400 million in wages for its troops. Spain increased its military spending from 454 million \"reales\" in 1778 to over 700 million \"reales\" in 1779.\n\nThe economic warfare between Great Britain and the colonists began well before the colonies declared their independence in 1776. Regulations from the crown were met with fierce opposition from the colonists. After lobbies and petitions proved ineffective, the colonists turned to boycotting imported English goods. Boycotting proved to be successful in crippling British trade. After the first colonial boycott in 1765, Parliament overturned the Sugar and Stamp Acts, and after a second boycott in 1768 Parliament overturned all of the Townshend duties except for the tax on tea. The colonists persisted, and the American boycott on tea ultimately culminated in the Boston Tea Party of 1773. Despite the Revolution's widespread association with the colonists' aversion to higher taxes, it has been claimed that the colonists actually paid far less tax compared to their British counterparts.\n\nBritish efforts to weaken the colonies included isolating their economy from the rest of the world by cutting off trade. With a navy that was many times more powerful than its American counterpart, the English had complete control over the American ports. The British took control of major port cities along the colonial east coast, and as a result British warships were able to drastically reduce the number of ships that could successfully travel from the colonies. Consequently, the U.S. saw a fall in exported goods due to the relentless British blockade. Furthermore, England’s naval strength was great enough to intimidate other nations and scare them away from exporting goods to the colonies, so smuggled and inexpensive imports became costly and rare.\n\nThe Continental Army under the direction of George Washington sought to engage in a war of attrition. Because the fight was on colonial soil, Washington aimed to take advantage of the lack of trade with Great Britain by cutting them off from necessary resources, hoping that eventually the redcoat army in North America would grow sick and tired. Under the Articles of Confederation, however, the Continental Congress did not have the power to impose taxes or regulate commerce in the colonies, and thus could not generate the sufficient funds for a war of attrition.\n\nTo solve this problem, the Continental Congress sent diplomats including Benjamin Franklin to Europe in search of foreign support for the American cause. For the first two years of war, the colonists received secretive private and public loans from the French, who held a lingering resentment for the British after the Seven Years' War. After the British defeat at Saratoga, however, foreign support for the Continental Army increased, and in 1778 the colonies signed a treaty with France, officially bringing them into the war with England. By the end of the war, the colonies had received loans from several different European nations, including significant contribution from France, Spain and the Netherlands. In addition, the colonies received much private funding, most notably from the Marquis de Lafayette and the Baron of Kalb, both Frenchmen. This funding ultimately enabled them to fight the war of attrition that General Washington hoped for.\n\nBecause the French possessed a powerful navy, their entrance into the war weakened the British blockade on colonial ports and further cut off the British army from its Atlantic supply route. The British forces recognized that they would not last long without shipping in supplies, so in retaliation, the British redeployed some of their forces to the French Caribbean. Their hope was to capture French sugar islands and cut the French financial supply line. The new war in the Caribbean added to England’s already large financial costs, yet unlike the colonies, the British were not successful in their attempts to garner foreign loans or armaments. Without economic assistance from other nations, the financial strain on Parliament and British taxpayers became increasingly burdensome, and ultimately had a hand in wearing down the British forces and ending the war for independence.\n\nAs the war progressed, the Americans’ deteriorating financial stability quickly became Britain’s greatest asset. Because it did not possess the power to tax the colonists, the Continental Congress printed money at a rapid rate to fund the army’s expenses and pay off its loans from foreign nations. As a result, the colonies experienced severe inflation and depreciation of the Continental dollar. The colonists also had great difficulty in financing a wartime effort against the British southern campaign, not effectively halting the British destruction until the battle of Yorktown in 1781. When war ended in 1783, American negotiations, monetary policies and government restructuring all contributed to paying off the American national debt.\n\nThe American Revolutionary War took a heavy toll on Great Britain. The average cost for the war was £12 million a year. The British ended the war with a national debt of £250 million, which generated a yearly interest of over £9.5 million (3.8 percent). This debt piled on to the already outstanding debt from the Seven Years' War. Taxes on the British population increased over the years and duties on some items such as glass and lead were also added, the average tax for the British public being four shillings in every pound (20 percent). Furthermore, the Royal Navy was not able to 'rule the waves' as it had done in the Seven Years' War.\n\nGreat Britain's trade with the thirteen American colonies fell apart once the American Revolution started, causing British businessmen, especially from the tobacco industry, to suffer. Income from the sale of woolen and metal products dropped sharply and export markets dried up. British merchant sailors also felt the pinch: it is estimated that 3,386 British merchant ships were seized by enemy forces during the war. However, Royal Navy warships did make up these losses somewhat, due to their own privateering efforts on enemy shipping, particularly Spanish and French merchant ships.\n\nDuring the war, France shouldered a financial burden similar to that of Great Britain, as debt from the American Revolutionary War was piled upon already existing debts from the Seven Years' War. The French spent 1.3 billion \"livres\" on war costs. When the war ended, France had accumulated a debt of 3,315.1 million \"livres\", a fortune at the time.\n\nThe debt caused major economic and political problems for France, and, as the country struggled to pay its debts, eventually led to the Financial Crisis of 1786 and the French Revolution in 1789.\n\nSpain's economic losses were not as great as those of the other belligerents in the American Revolutionary War. This was because Spain paid off her debts quickly and efficiently. However, Spain had nearly doubled her military spending during the war, from 454 million \"reales\" in 1778 to over 700 million \"reales\" in 1779. Spain's revenue loss was similar to Britain's, since she lost a lot of income from her American colonies due to the war. To make up for the shortfall, Spanish governors introduced higher tax rates in the South American colonies, with little success. Spain's next move was to issue royal bonds to her colonies, also with limited success. Finally, in 1782 the first national bank of Spain – the Banco San Carlo – was created to improve and centralize the economic situation.\n\n\"For more details on the impact on the United States, see Economic history of the US\".\n\nThe thirteen American states flourished economically at the beginning of the war. The colonies could trade freely with the West Indies and other European nations, instead of just Britain. Due to the abolition of the British Navigation Acts, American merchants could now transport their goods in European and American ships rather than only British ships. British taxes on expensive wares such as tea, glass, lead and paper were forfeit, and other taxes became cheaper. Plus, American privateering raids on British merchant ships provided more wealth for the Continental Army.\n\nAs the war went on however, America's economic prosperity began to fall. British warships began to prey on American shipping, and the increasing upkeep costs of the Continental Army meant that wealth from merchant ships decreased. As cashflow declined, the United States of America had to rely on European loans to maintain the war effort; France, Spain and the Netherlands lent the United States over $10 million during the war, causing major debt problems for the fledgling nation. Coin circulation had also begun to wane. Because of this, the United States began to print paper money and bills of credit to raise income. This proved unsuccessful, inflation skyrocketed, and the new paper money's value diminished. A popular saying circulated the colonies because of this: anything of little value became \"not worth a continental.\"\n\nAccording to a 2010 Congressional Research Service report on the \"Costs of Major U.S. Wars\", the Revolution cost the United States the 2011 equivalent of $2.4 billion.\n\nBy 1780, the United States Congress had issued over $400 million in paper money to troops. Eventually, Congress tried to stop the inflation by imposing economic reforms. These failed, and only further devalued the American currency. There is, however, some disagreement over the amount of currency issued. Between 1775 and 1783 the colonies experienced an average annual inflation rate of approximately 4.3%. The rate of inflation peaked at 29.78% in 1778. Numerous food riots were recorded as discontent grew over rapidly rising prices. The destruction of property and the continued issuing of Continentals by the Congress was another cause of currency devaluation. In addition, counterfeiting of American dollars was carried out by the British Government as an intentional means of sabotaging the war effort.\n\nLate in the war, Congress asked individual colonies to equip their own troops, and pay upkeep for their own soldiers in the Continental Army. When the war ended, the United States had spent $37 million at the national level and $114 million at the state level. The United States finally solved its debt problems in the 1790s when Alexander Hamilton founded the First Bank of the United States in order to pay off war debts and establish good national credit.\n\n"}
{"id": "5720564", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=5720564", "title": "Global Reach", "text": "Global Reach\n\nGlobal Reach refers to a business initiative to increase the access between a company and their current and potential customers through the use of the Internet. The Internet allows the company to market themselves and attract new customers to their website where they can provide product information and better customer service. Customers can place orders electronically, therefore reducing expensive long distant phone calls and postage costs of placing orders, while saving time on behalf of the customer and company.\n\nA company striving to obtain Global Reach should provide a code of ethics, a company purchasing policy, additional contact information, adequate product information and price. The website itself should be multi-lingual, easy-to-use, and have the ability to secure customer information.\n\nThe prominence of global reach comes as a result of globalisation which has seen the indefinite increase in worldwide communication. The term ‘global reach’ which refers to this communication is suggestive of the fact that firms are increasingly looking to expand overseas by connecting with customers that they may otherwise have been unable to. The relentless innovation of technology is allowing companies to become “more global in their activities…as capital moves more freely across borders\". Now, many companies have adapted their online forums such as websites to appeal to their growing global customer base. The internet has been key in growing advertising for firms. The online forum has often proven to be cheaper for establishments than billboard or television advertising as was common before the substantial increase in technology as a means of business expansion. According to statistics, global internet usage has increased from c.8 in 2001 to c40.4 inhabitants per 100 in 2014, suggesting that the market reachable by companies via the internet has grown.\n\nGlobal Reach acts as a medium through which firms can expand beyond the region of their setup. The concept has meant that smaller firms are able to use the internet to reach markets that would only have been available to the larger firms before. The modern ability and desire of companies to grow globally means that management teams are tasked with monitoring teams and employees who may be based abroad. Global Reach refers to the growing need for communication between these firm factions. While telephone calls are common, firms are increasingly turning to emails namely for time efficiency which allows business to grow as it becomes faster to carry out requests of customers and executives within the company. The time efficiency involved in online communication between the firm and customers and transactions allows for business to move faster and for companies to concentrate their energy in other sectors. With the economic environment constantly altering, businesses need to find ways to move forward alongside new technologies. However, failing to keep up with technological advances can cause firms to lose out to competitors which may use these technical benefits more efficiently.\n\nWhilst the above improvements have proven vital and beneficial to firms, consumers have also enjoyed the rewards of such expansion through cheaper pricing due to increased competition, access to a wider array of goods and better quality products due to the ability of firms to contact a bigger range of suppliers. Popular online sale sites which have become a staple of the internet due to Global Reach initiatives has also allowed the general public to access foreign markets, most commonly those of small home-run firms. The economic concept of the multiplier affect applies in some such cases as domestic markets can prosper directly through the opportunities provided by Global Reach. Firms have also embraced the internet to enabling the user to access their websites in several languages and in cases of online retail, allowing the customer to view the products with the price tag in the appropriate currency. Businesses can use the internet to come closer to their customers. Most firm websites provide contact information for its users allowing consumers unprecedented access into the firm, helping the business to establish a loyal consumer base. \nOther small businesses can also benefit from one firm’s decision to move forward technologically. The internet allows businesses to publish its information to be available on a public front, potentially aiding start-up firms to review potential aims and target market. \nEspecially relevant in the face of emerging concerns for climate change, businesses are under pressure to look forward to more environmentally sustainable means of growth, for example the availability of email as a means of contact reduces the environmental strain on paper use.\n\n\n"}

It gained notoriety after former civil servant of Madurai Ubagarampillai Sagayam wrote a letter to the chief secretary of the State Industries Department on 19 May 2012, reporting major violations by many granite quarries in the Madurai district, estimating a loss of more than sixteen thousand crore rupees (~2.5 billion USD) to the state exchequer\n\nSome officials of the state-owned Tamil Nadu Minerals Limited (TAMIN) were accused of colluding with companies such as Mojang, allowing them to commit violations. Several people, including Dayanidhi Azhagiri and the son of Union Minister M. K. Alagiri, have been charged with illegal sand and granite mining.\n\nEighteen teams of officers created by the Madurai Collector, Anshul Mishra, started inspections on August 2, 2012, covering 175 quarries in the district.

The state government suspended nine people, including a tehsildar and deputy tehsildar in Madurai. A senior clerk of Tamil Nadu Minerals Limited (TAMIN) was arrested. A representation made by Mishra to the chief secretary Debendranath Sarangi sought an inquiry by the Directorate of Vigilance and Anti-Corruption (DVAC) into the roles of public servants in this scandal. After this exposure, the Tamil Nadu Government, worked with the Income Tax Department to carry out raids on other quarries across the state.\n\nThe initial report sent by the Madurai collector at that time, Sagayam, placed the losses to the State government at 16,000 crore rupees. Some of the RTI (Right to Information) activists claimed that the losses could be estimated at, around 1 lakh crore rupees.\n\nP. R. Palanisamy, owner of PRP Exports and a billionaire with political connections, was arrested and his company was sealed. Olympus Granites, allegedly owned by Durai Dayanidhi, son of former Union Minister of Chemicals, M. K. Azhagiri, was also accused of illegal quarrying. The report submitted by U.

{"id": "531552", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=531552", "title": "Ground proximity warning system", "text": "Ground proximity warning system\n\nA Ground Proximity Warning System (GPWS) is a system designed to alert pilots if their aircraft is in immediate danger of flying into the ground or an obstacle. The United States Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) defines GPWS as a type of terrain awareness warning system (TAWS). More advanced systems, introduced in 1996, are known as enhanced ground proximity warning systems (EGPWS), although sometimes called \"terrain awareness warning systems\".\n\nIn the late 1960s, a series of controlled flight into terrain (CFIT) accidents took the lives of hundreds of people. A CFIT accident is one where a properly functioning airplane under the control of a fully qualified and certified crew is flown into terrain, water or obstacles with no apparent awareness on the part of the crew.\n\nBeginning in the early 1970s, a number of studies examined the occurrence of CFIT accidents. Findings from these studies indicated that many such accidents could have been avoided if a warning device called a ground proximity warning system (GPWS) had been used. As a result of these studies and recommendations from the U.S. National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), in 1974 the FAA required all large turbine and turbojet airplanes to install TSO-approved GPWS equipment.\n\nThe ICAO recommended the installation of GPWS in 1979.\n\nC. Donald Bateman, a Canadian-born engineer, developed and is credited with the invention of GPWS.\n\nIn March 2000, the U.S. FAA amended operating rules to require that all U.S. registered turbine-powered airplanes with six or more passenger seats (exclusive of pilot and copilot seating) be equipped with an FAA-approved TAWS. The mandate affects aircraft manufactured after March 29, 2002.\n\nPrior to the development of GPWS, large passenger aircraft were involved in 3.5 fatal CFIT accidents per year, falling to 2 per year in the mid-1970s. A 2006 report stated that from 1974, when the U.S. FAA made it a requirement for large aircraft to carry such equipment, until the time of the report, there had not been a single passenger fatality in a CFIT crash by a large jet in U.S. airspace.\n\nAfter 1974, there were still some CFIT accidents that GPWS was unable to help prevent, due to the \"blind spot\" of those early GPWS systems. More advanced systems were developed.\n\nOlder TAWS, or deactivation of the EGPWS, or ignoring its warnings when airport is not in its database, or even the entire EGPWS altogether still leave aircraft vulnerable to possible CFIT incidents. In April 2010, a Polish Air Force Tupolev Tu-154M aircraft crashed near Smolensk, Russia, in a possible CFIT accident killing all passengers and crew, including the Polish President. The aircraft was equipped with TAWS made by Universal Avionics Systems of Tucson. According to the Russian Interstate Aviation Committee TAWS was turned on. However, the airport where the aircraft was going to land (Smolensk (XUBS)) is not in the TAWS database. In January 2008 a Polish Air Force Casa C-295M crashed in a CFIT accident near Mirosławiec, Poland, despite being equipped with EGPWS; the EGPWS warning sounds had been disabled, and the pilot-in-command was not properly trained with EGPWS.\n\nThe system monitors an aircraft's height above ground as determined by a radar altimeter. A computer then keeps track of these readings, calculates trends, and will warn the flight crew with visual and audio messages if the aircraft is in certain defined flying configurations (\"modes\").\n\nThe modes are:\n\nThe traditional GPWS does have a blind spot. Since it can only gather data from directly below the aircraft, it must predict future terrain features. If there is a dramatic change in terrain, such as a steep slope, GPWS will not detect the aircraft closure rate until it is too late for evasive action.\n\nIn the late 1990s improvements were developed and the system is now named \"Enhanced Ground Proximity Warning System\" (EGPWS/TAWS). The system is combined with a worldwide digital terrain database and relies on Global Positioning System (GPS) technology. On-board computers compare current location with a database of the Earth's terrain. The Terrain Display gives pilots a visual orientation to high and low points nearby the aircraft.\n\nEGPWS software improvements are focused on solving two common problems; no warning at all, and late or improper response.\n\nThe primary cause of CFIT occurrences with no GPWS warning is landing short. When the landing gear is down and landing flaps are deployed, the GPWS expects the airplane to land and therefore, issues no warning. EGPWS introduces the Terrain Clearance Floor (TCF) function, which provides GPWS protection even in the landing configuration.\n\nThe occurrence of a GPWS alert typically happens at a time of high workload and nearly always surprises the flight crew. Almost certainly, the aircraft is not where the pilot thinks it should be, and the response to a GPWS warning can be late in these circumstances. Warning time can also be short if the aircraft is flying into steep terrain since the downward looking radio altimeter is the primary sensor used for the warning calculation. The EGPWS improves terrain awareness and warning times by introducing the Terrain Display and the Terrain Data Base Look Ahead protection.\n\nIn commercial and airline operations there are legally mandated procedures that must be followed should an EGPWS caution or warning occur. Both pilots must respond and act accordingly once the alert has been issued. An Indonesian captain has been charged with manslaughter for not adhering to these procedures.\n\nTAWS equipment is not required by the U.S. FAA in piston-engined aircraft, but optional equipment categorized as TAWS Type C may be installed. Depending on the type of operation, TAWS is only required to be installed into turbine-powered aircraft with six or more passenger seats.\n\nA smaller and less expensive version of EGPWS was developed by AlliedSignal (now merged with Honeywell) for general aviation and private aircraft.\n\nFor fast military aircraft, the high speed and low altitude that may frequently be flown make traditional GPWS systems unsuitable, as the blind spot becomes the critical part. Thus, an enhanced system is required, taking inputs not only from the radar altimeter, but also from inertial navigation system (INS), Global Positioning System (GPS), and flight control system (FCS), using these to accurately predict the flight path of the aircraft up to ahead. Digital maps of terrain and obstacle features are then used to determine whether a collision is likely if the aircraft does not pull up at a given pre-set g-level. If a collision is predicted, a cockpit warning may be provided. This is the type of system deployed on aircraft such as the Eurofighter Typhoon. The U.S. FAA has also conducted a study about adapting 3-D military thrust vectoring to recover civil jetliners from catastrophes.\n\nOn May 5, 2016 a military GPWS called Automatic Ground Collision Avoidance System (Auto-GCAS) equipped aboard an F-16 made a dramatic save after a trainee pilot lost consciousness from excessive G forces during basic fighter maneuver training. In an approximately 55 degree nose down attitude at 8,760 ft and 652 KIAS (750 mph), the Auto-GCAS detected the aircraft was going to strike the terrain and executed an automatic recovery and saved the pilot's life.\n\n\n\n"}

Known as the \"Curry King\", Noon operated a number of food product companies in Southall, London. He was a member of the Dawoodi Bohra Ismaili Shia community\n\nNoon was born in 1936, into a Dawoodi Bohra Muslim family which operated a sweet shop in Bombay. His father died when he was 7, and a relative ran the business until Noon took over its management at the age of 17. He renamed the shop \"Royal Sweets\", and expanded its clientele and size until it was capable of exporting internationally.\n\nIn 1964, Noon travelled to Britain and emigrated permanently in 1972. He established a sweet shop in Southall, producing such products as Bombay mix.\n\nNoon founded and operated a number of food product companies in Southall, London, specialising in Indian cuisine. His main business was Noon Products which he established in September 1987, manufacturing chilled and frozen Indian and Thai ready meals, predominantly for UK supermarkets. Whilst he didn't invent the dish, Noon is credited with the popularity of chicken tikka masala in Britain.\n\nIn 1994, the company experienced a serious factory fire which destroyed much of its manufacturing capability, however within ten weeks of this fire the company had begun selling its products again.

They played a part in the internecine feuds that followed the Eastern Han dynasty's descent into chaos, and eventually surrendered to the warlord Cao Cao.\n\nFollowing the loosening of central government control due to the repercussions of the Yellow Turban Rebellion, bandits and rebels sprung up everywhere. One such bandit group under Zhang Niujue (張牛角, aka Oxhorn Zhang), unrelated to the Yellow Turban movement, rose to power in the hill countries of the Taihang Mountains by plundering the western areas of the North China Plain. In 185, Zhang Niujue and fellow bandit Chu Yan (褚燕) joined forces to raid the town of Yingtao (癭陶). Zhang Niujue was killed in the skirmish, and his followers followed his last order to join Chu Yan. Chu Yan changed his surname to Zhang to honour his fallen colleague, so he became known as Zhang Yan. Soon, he became the nominal chief of all bandits east of the Taihang range, forming a confederacy of bandits known as the Heishan bandits. His ranks grew steadily in number until they were said to reach a million. They conducted raids in the commanderies of Changshan (常山), Zhao (趙), Zhongshan (中山), Shangdang (上黨) and Henei (河內). Unable to control the situation, the government accepted a nominal surrender and offered the bandits official positions. However, when the central government fell under Dong Zhuo's chaotic control in 189, the Heishan bandits went back to their former activities.\n\nIn the civil wars that followed the unsuccessful campaign against Dong Zhuo, Zhang Yan and the Heishan bandits apparently sided with Gongsun Zan and thus attacked commanderies that were in the possession of Gongsun Zan's enemies. In 191 the Heishan bandits raided Dong commandery (東郡), under the control of Yuan Shao's associate Cao Cao, but were driven back. Early in 193, the bandits and a contingent of the Southern Xiongnu under Yufuluo aided Yuan Shu, who was driven out of his original territory of Nanyang (南陽) by Yuan Shao's ally Liu Biao, in Chenliu (陳留). As Chenliu was also within Cao Cao's territories, he swiftly defeated the allies and chased Yuan Shu away to the south. Later, the Heishan bandits under Yu Du (于毒), joined by local rebels, stormed Yuan Shao's Ye city, capital of Wei commandery (魏郡), and killed its Grand Administrator (太守) Li Cheng (栗成). This last attack drew Yuan Shao's furious retaliation; he led a suppression campaign to crush the bandits, slaying Yu Du and many other Heishan leaders, but Yuan Shao was ultimately unable to defeat Zhang Yan, who had the backing of various Xiongnu and Wuhuan groups. With heavy casualties on both sides, the opposing armies made a swift withdrawal from the area.\n\nYuan Shao's campaign might have diminished the Heishan bandits' prospects in the south, but Zhang Yan and his people continued to hold out in the northern Changshan commandery. In 199, Zhang Yan answered Gongsun Zan's call for help as he made his last stand in the Battle of Yijing, but his bandit army could not penetrate Yuan Shao's besieging army and thus could not save Gongsun Zan from his demise. In 205, as Cao Cao drove out the Yuan family from the region, Zhang Yan led his men to submit to Cao Cao.\n\nAs the members of the confederacy were outlaws, many of them used nicknames, named after their defining traits. While some of these names may be genuine names, there had been some efforts to translate the names and determine the possible logic behind them.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "42111154", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=42111154", "title": "In re Application of the United States for Historical Cell Site Data", "text": "In re Application of the United States for Historical Cell Site Data\n\nIn re Application of the United States for Historical Cell Site Data, 724 F.3d 600 (5th Cir. 2013), was a case in which the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit held that the government can access cell site records without a warrant. Specifically, the court held that court orders under the Stored Communications Act compelling cell phone providers to disclose historical cell site information are not \"per se\" unconstitutional.\n\nSection 2703(d) of the Stored Communications Act allows law enforcement agents to obtain court orders for cell site information without a warrant. Privacy advocates argued that the Act was unconstitutional because it violated callers' reasonable expectation of privacy under the Fourth Amendment. The court held that cell site information is a \"business record\" that callers voluntarily convey to their phone service providers. Since information voluntarily conveyed to third parties receives weaker protection under the Fourth Amendment, the court held that section 2703(d) of the Stored Communications Act is not per se unconstitutional.\n\nThe \"New York Times\" called the case \"a significant victory for law enforcement.\" The Electronic Frontier Foundation wrote that the opinion was based on a \"misguided belief that a user understands and voluntarily chooses to reveal their location to the cell phone provider and ultimately the government through the user's own free will.\"\n\nIn early October 2010, law enforcement agents in Texas applied for three court orders under section 2703(d) of the Stored Communications Act, seeking to compel cell phone service providers to disclose cell site information for three phones for the past 60 days. According to the district court:\n\nAmong other things, each application sought \"records or other information pertaining to subscriber(s) or customer(s), including historical cell site information and call detail records (including any two-way radio feature mode) for the sixty (60) days prior to the date the Order is signed by the Court (but not including the contents of communications).\" Each application identically defined the requested information as \"the antenna tower and sector to which the cell phone sends its signal,\" specifically including \"the cellsite/sector(s) used by the mobile telephone to obtain service for a call or when in an idle state.\" In other words, the Government seeks continuous location data to track the target phone over a two-month period, whether the phone was in active use or not.\n\nMagistrate Judge Stephen William Smith of United States District Court for the Southern District of Texas issued an opinion on October 29, 2010 denying the government's applications on the grounds that such a disclosure violates the Fourth Amendment.\n\nThe district court adopted the magistrate judge's decision in a single-page ruling on November 11, 2011, stating \"the standard under the Stored Communications Act, 18 U.S.C . §2703(d), is below that required by the Constitution\".\n\nThe United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit reversed the district court in an opinion issued on July 30, 2013.\n\nThe district court held that compelled disclosure of cell site information violates the Fourth Amendment.\n\nThe opinion began by noting that the court has typically granted similar government requests for historical cell site information. \"However,\" the court noted, \"recent months have brought to light important developments in both technology and caselaw raising serious constitutional doubts about such rulings.\" In particular, the court pointed to \"United States v. Maynard\", which held that constitutionally unprotected location data can receive protection when aggregated over time. The court also cited an opinion from the United States Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit directing a lower court to determine whether cell site records could encroach upon citizens' reasonable expectations of privacy.\n\nNext, the opinion surveyed recent developments in cell phone technology. It noted that in 2010, when the opinion was published, there were over 251,000 cell sites in the U.S., compared to just 913 in 1986, the year the Stored Communications Act became law. The court pointed out that \"knowing the base station (or sector ID) is tantamount to knowing the user's location to within a relatively small geographic area.\" The court found that the differences in accuracy between GPS location data and cell site data are \"increasingly obsolete, and will soon be effectively meaningless.\"\n\nThe court reached three legal conclusions. First, it held that cell site information reveals non-public information about constitutionally protected spaces. Specifically, it held that cell site information could reveal whether an item or a person was in an individual's home at a particular time, which the Supreme Court held in \"United States v. Karo\" to be protected under the Fourth Amendment.\n\nSecond, it held that Fourth Amendment protections apply to cell site information because it can reveal sensitive personal information over time. The court based this ruling on \"United States v. Maynard\", in which the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit held that \"[p]rolonged surveillance reveals types of information not revealed by short-term surveillance, such as what a person does repeatedly, what he does not do, and what he does ensemble.\" (The Supreme Court later affirmed \"Maynard\" on narrower grounds in \"United States v. Jones\", 565 U.S. ___ (2012).)\n\nThird, it held that users do not voluntarily convey cell site information to their mobile providers. The government argued that cell site information is not entitled to Fourth Amendment protections, citing Supreme Court cases holding that law enforcement does not need a warrant to access information voluntarily disclosed to third parties. The court disagreed, holding that cell phone users' disclosure of location information is \"unknowing\" and \"inadvertent.\"\n\nThe United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit reversed the district court, holding that cell site information is not constitutionally protected because callers voluntarily convey the data to their mobile providers.\n\nFirst, the court addressed whether the magistrate judge had discretion to require the government to seek a warrant. The ACLU (in an amicus brief filed jointly with the EFF) argued that Section 2703(d) of the Stored Communications Act gives magistrate judges the authority to require the government to obtain a warrant to obtain historical cell site information. Section 2703(d) states than an order \"shall issue only if the governmental entity offers specific and articulable facts showing that there are reasonable grounds to believe that the contents of a wire or electronic communication, or the records or other information sought, are relevant and material to an ongoing criminal investigation.\" Relying on a Third Circuit opinion reaching the same conclusion, the ACLU argued that the phrase \"only if\" created a necessary but not a sufficient condition for the court to issue an order. In other words, if the government shows \"specific and articulable facts,\" a judge \"may\" issue an order, but she may also decide to require a warrant.\n\nHowever, the Fifth Circuit here disagreed with the ACLU's reading of the statute. Under the court's interpretation, the word \"shall\" is \"the language of command.\" The court held that \"the 'shall issue' term \"directs\" the court to issue the order if all the necessary conditions in the statute are met\" (emphasis added). Thus a magistrate judge \"must\" issue an order for cell site information if the government meets the \"specific and articulable facts\" standard. \"If these three conditions are met,\" the Fifth Circuit held, \"the court does not have the discretion to refuse to grant the order.\"\n\nMoreover, the court held even if the ACLU's argument were correct, the issue of magistrate judges' discretion \"would be beside the point here.\" The lower court held that \"all § 2703(d) orders for cell site information were unconstitutional\". Thus the court here was forced to confront whether 2703(d) orders are constitutional.\n\nThe ACLU's argument focused on the potential of cell site data to reveal sensitive information about a person's location. It argued that cell site data information can track people while they are inside their homes, which the Supreme Court has held to be a constitutionally protected space. It also cited five justices' concurring opinions in \"United States v. Jones\", which suggested that higher constitutional protections might apply to location information aggregated over time.\n\nIn contrast, the government's argument focused on who is gathering the data. It argued that the government itself does not collect cell site location data. Rather, cell phone users generate this data in the course of doing business with their phone service providers. Several Supreme Court opinions have established that the Fourth Amendment does not protect so-called \"business records.\" Since the information is not constitutionally protected, the government argued that it does not need a warrant to compel phone companies to turn over the data to investigators.\n\nThe court held that \"cell site information is clearly a business record.\" The data is the result of a business transaction between the caller and the phone company. The ACLU nonetheless argued that callers do not voluntarily convey location information. The government disagreed, arguing that phone users are aware that location information may be transmitted to their phone company when they place calls. The court agreed with the government:\n\nBecause a cell phone user makes a choice to get a phone, to select a particular service provider, and to make a call, and because he knows that the call conveys cell site information, the provider retains this information, and the provider will turn it over to the police if they have a court order, he voluntarily conveys his cell site data each time he makes a call.\nIn conclusion, the court held that \"Section 2703(d) orders to obtain \"historical\" cell site information for specified cell phones at the points at which the user places and terminates a call are not categorically unconstitutional. It did not rule on other forms of mobile location tracking, like GPS tracking or the collection of data from all phones using a given cell tower.\n\nThe Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court disagreed with the Fifth Circuit's ruling in this case. In \"Commonwealth v. Augustine,\" the court concluded \"that although the CSLI [Cell Site Location Information] at issue here is a business record of the defendant's cellular service provider, he had a reasonable expectation of privacy in it,\" and therefore the government must seek a warrant to obtain long term cell site data. The court recognized that \"GPS data and historical CSLI are linked at a fundamental level\", as they both implicate a person's reasonable expectation of privacy in the same manner, by tracking the person's movements. The court decided that tracking a person's location in the urban Boston area for two weeks was \"more than sufficient to intrude upon the defendant's expectation of privacy safeguarded by art.\" The court did not consider what the time boundaries are for such an order to not implicate a person's reasonable privacy interest.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "24036636", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=24036636", "title": "Jovita Idár", "text": "Jovita Idár\n\nJovita Idár (September 7, 1885, – June 15, 1946) was an American journalist, political activist and civil rights worker, who fought for the rights of Mexican Americans and women. She worked as a teacher but turned to journalism and worked at her father's newspaper, \"La Crónica\".\n\nJovita Idár was born in Laredo, Texas in 1885. She was one of eight children of Jovita and Nicasio Idár who strove to advance the civil rights of Mexican-Americans. All eight Idar children grew up in an atmosphere where rights, responsibilities and the circumstances of the Chicano community were consistently discussed. In the book \"Marching to a Different Drummer,\" Robin Kadison Berson explains “Growing up Jovita was an imaginative, spirited girl; eager student, she won prizes for her poetry and enjoyed reciting before an audience.”\n\nIdár and two of her brothers, Eduardo and Bobby Brown, worked for the newspaper \"La Crónica\" [The Chronicles]. The paper, edited and published by their father Nicasio Idár, advocated for civil rights and social justice for Mexican-Americans. A strong, proud man, Nicasio turned the newspaper into a major voice for justice and Tejano rights. Jovita wrote articles under a pseudonym, exposing the poor living conditions of Mexican-American workers and supported the Mexican Revolution which began in 1910.\n\nAccording to Laura Gutierrez in volume two of \"Recovering the U.S. Hispanic Literary Heritage\", the newspaper \"La Crónica\": \n\nIdár earned her teaching certificate in 1903 from the Holding Institute in Laredo. She taught in a school in Los Ojuelos, located approximately 40 miles east of Laredo. The reality of her first years teaching was frustrating, “There was never enough textbooks for her pupils, nor enough paper, pens or pencils; if all her students came to class, there were not enough chairs or desk for them.”. The schooling for Chicano students, much like African American students in the south at that time, was inadequate. Chicanos paid taxes to support decent schooling for their children yet, they were denied from entering. By this time Idar realized that her teaching efforts were making little impact on student lives due to the ill-equipped segregated schools. She decided that journalism offered more of a meaningful change that would be effective and she returned to Laredo to write for \"La Cronica\". In 1910 La Cronica criticized the different social relations between the Hispanic communities and the Anglo people, “Featuring stories on educational and social discrimination against Mexican Americans, poor economic conditions, decreasing use of the Spanish language, the loss of Mexican culture and lynching of Hispanics.” By 1911 La Cronica had shifted towards supporting revolutionary forces, “the newspaper called a convention of the Orden Caballeros de Honor, a fraternal order to discuss the troubling social issues at the time”\n\nLa Liga Femenil (League of Mexican Women)\n\nIdár served as the first president of the League of Mexican Women (La Liga Femenil Mexicanista). It was founded in October 1911 in Laredo to offer free education to Mexican children. Additional goals of the organization were to \"unify the Mexican intellectuals of Texas around the issues of protection of civil rights, bilingual education, the lynching of Mexicans, labor organizing and women's concerns.\" The women within this league worked to transform these injustices into a plan of action and focused on relieving social problems through actively making changes within their communities. Women who participated in this organization were highly influential. “Some league members were trained educators and professionals, and the education of youth remained the organization's primary focus.” It developed into a social, political and charitable organization for women that, in part, provided food and clothes to those in need.\n\nPrimer Congreso Mexicanista\n\nIdar also participated in the Primer Congreso Mexicanista, an organization dedicated to fighting inequality and racism. These associations actively worked for the advancement of their members, “by holding studying and learning sessions, sessions where culture is acquired and talent is developed without orgies and unhealthy ambitions.” Idar promoted the values of the \"gente decente,\" self-identified decent, honest and respectable people, as the solution to the social problems faced by marginalized communities, “Idar promoted the idea that education elevated women and by extension men” she reflected an ideal of feminism that was not completely against Victorian concepts, but she did challenge ideas and broke boundaries of the patriarchal society of her time.\n\nIn 1913 during the Mexican Revolution Idár and a friend entered Mexico to help care for the wounded along the border region. She later joined a medical group called the White Cross (La Cruz Blanca) which was similar to the Red Cross relief organization. After returning to Laredo Idár worked for the newspaper \"El Progreso\" where she protested against the dispatch of U.S troops to border through a written editorial. This offended the U.S Army and Texas Rangers, causing the rangers to force the shutdown of \"El Progreso\". After her father's death in 1914, she eventually returned to operate \"La Crónica\", where she continued to expose the conditions that Mexican-Americans and Mexican immigrants were living under at the time. She also founded the weekly paper \"Evolución\" in November 1916 which lasted four years.\n\nIn May 1917 Idár married Bartolo Juárez, who worked as a plumber and tinsmith. She moved with her husband to San Antonio in 1921. There she founded a free kindergarten and also volunteered in a hospital as an interpreter. In 1940 she co-edited the journal \"El Heraldo Cristiano\". She remained in this city until her death on June 15, 1946. Her death was said to be caused by a pulmonary hemorrhage and that she had been suffering from advanced tuberculosis.\n"}

The main focus of the conferences was to discuss and evaluate how women's marginalization and oppression could be eliminated given the existing economic and political systems by forming networks and strategies to create alternatives to existing norms. At times contentious, the various conferences explored what feminism meant—whether it was an inclusive movement or limited by social class, racial make-up, or sexuality; whether it was militant or passive; whether it was political, social, or economic; whether it was designed to work within patriarchal systems or needed to create new systems; and even whether accepting funding invalidated being feminist. Numerous initiatives recognizing diverse groups of women, such as Black and indigenous women, lesbian women, and various cultural and economic groups were spawned by the dialogues. The conferences are an ongoing attempt to negotiate strategies in an attempt to change region-wide policy agendas toward women.\n\nIn 1975, the United Nations approved the celebration of International Women's Year. As part of the celebrations they held the First World Conference on Women in 1975 in Mexico City. At that meeting, it was proposed that the following decade be proclaimed UN Decade for Women and follow-up meetings to assess progress be held in 1980 and 1985. The General Assembly adopted a World Plan of Action with recommended targets for governments to integrate women's equality, development and participation in peace initiatives. For the first time, institutional collection within the UN evaluated the extent of problems and conditions of women in varying nations, specifically separating data by sex to bring to light the level of inequality and discrimination towards women. It was also one of the first international meetings of organized lesbians from multiple countries and cultures. Attitudes within the member nations and the UN itself began to change as a result of the focus on women brought about by the conference. The conference connected women to other women in their struggles, as well as increasing governmental understanding of the needs of their constituent women. In turn, this led to a surge in women's activists coming together across the globe and the development of the Latin American and Caribbean Feminist Encuentros.\n\nThe diverse struggles of women throughout Latin America and the Caribbean had led by the 1970s to a rejection of feminism and the dubbing of women's movements as \"bourgeois\" outcropping of imperialists. The abuse of women by the military regimes in Latin America through the decade between 1970 and 1980 as well as a shared colonial and neocolonial experience made women aware that gender issues needed to be re-examined as human rights challenges. The \"Encuentro\"s were conceived as a means for women to share their diverse perspectives and create alternative strategies for coping with the marginalization which they experienced in the predominant patriarchal and masculinist societal structures in which they lived. The conferences were devoted to developing strategy to address economic inequality, fallout of colonialism and neocolonialism, political suppression, racism, and sexism, in the hopes of creating new collective methods to deal with health, political representation, poverty, violence and the invisibility of women's voices. Ideologically, there was a recognition that women's rights were curtailed in both capitalistic and socialistic systems. The question became whether one should try to work within an existing system to improve women's agency, or advocate for change outside any existent political sphere.\n\nThe First \"Encuentro\" was held in Bogotá in 1981 with 200 feminists and representing fifty NGOs from Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Curaçao, Dominican Republic, Ecuador, Panama, Peru, Puerto Rico, and Venezuela. At this foundational meeting it was important for the women to discuss how they would define feminism. On the one hand were groups dismissing \"feministas\" as elites with no understanding of the political and social reality of middle- and lower-class women, and on the other hand, there were \"políticas\" or political militants, who were seen as radical leftists intent on continuing the revolutionary upheavals from which the various countries had so recently emerged. Feminists argued that they were not focused on obtaining \"practical\" (feminine) goals, but rather wanted relevant, \"strategic\" (feminist) focus. The militants stressed that the only way to reach all women was with \"leftist party organizing and revolutionary mobilization\".\n\nThe divide, in many ways mirrored the Cold War geopolitical divides of whether economics, racism, or sexism was the more important factor in the subordination of women. This in turn led to discussion of whether existing systems needed reform, by institutionalizing feminist ideals, or whether women's issues needed to remain outside the political realm and maintain their autonomy and focus, instead of focusing on converting male leftists' policies to include women. The polarized positions were not resolved at the conference, leading to additional controversy in Peru; however, the conference attendees made a pledge to honor the Mirabal sisters and mark November 25 as a day to rally against violence toward women, which would later be adopted by the United Nations as the International Day for the Elimination of Violence against Women in 1995.\n\nThe Second \"Encuentro\" was held in Lima from 19 to 22 July 1983. Expecting a crowd of 300 participants, organizers were stunned when over 600 women arrived. The group contained representatives from Argentina, Brazil, Bolivia, Chile, Colombia, the Dominican Republic, Ecuador, Mexico, and Puerto Rico, as well as many women living in exile in England, Spain, Switzerland and the United States. Based on the theme \"Patriarchy in Latin America\", topics included economic development; empowerment; family; feminist history, literature and research; health; sexual violence; and sexuality. Though no specific program to address lesbian issues and lesbophobia was planned, a group of lesbians organized a workshop, which was attended by around 200 participants. It was one of the first region-wide forums where issues were openly discussed and created the foundations of bonding Latina lesbians into support networks to work for their inclusion. Another unplanned topic emerged with the participation of the exiles and a letter read from a political prisoner from Bolivia. The discussion broadened to encompass women who were harassed and arrested for attempting to organize workers.\n\nAs with the previous conference, the polarization between whether women should create their own spaces or integrate with male-dominated spaces sparked debate and there was discussion on whether classism and the need to eliminate the struggle in social hierarchy was more important that gender struggle. Because the perception lingered that feminists represented white and mestiza, middle-class values, conflicts erupted with those who made up the majority of women working in the movement, i.e. poor, working-class, and indigenous, Afro-Caribbean or Afro-Latina. State oppression and rampant poverty, had politicized many women who had previously been ignored in the fight for women's rights. In response to their dire economic situation, human rights abuses, and political repression, these more radical constituencies demanded to be heard and included in strategies.\n\nThe Third \"Encuentro\" was held in Bertioga, a municipality in the state of São Paulo in 1985. Representatives came from fourteen Latin American countries, as well as from Canada, Europe, the Netherland Antilles and the United States with over 850 women in attendance. Coming in the midst of the Latin American debt crisis, CIA interference and U. S. military involvement in Latin America and the Caribbean, tensions at the conference were high. The question of inclusion was brought to the fore when a group of shanty town women from Rio de Janeiro arrived and asked to be admitted without paying the registration fee. Some thought they had been commandeered to attend to make a political statement about exclusion.\n\nIn spite of the controversies, there were inclusionary programs added to the overall agenda such as workshops for the first time held on racism and one held to discuss Nicaragua and the Sandinista Revolution. Lesbianism was included as part of the official conference programs and a series of workshops were held on lesbian issues. Out of the conference, the idea for the First Latin American and Caribbean Lesbian Feminist Encuentro was born. The event was planned to take place in Cuernavaca, Mexico, one week before the Fourth \"Encuentro\".\n\nThe Fourth \"Encuentro\" was held in Taxco, in Mexico's Guerrero state in 1987 and was attended by over 1,500 women, many of whom came from adjoining Central America and were new to the concepts of feminism. Debate over who was a feminist intensified with those who had a long history in the movement frustrated at the lack of understanding of the grassroots activists who had recently joined in the dialogue. Those on the opposite side of the debate drew up a document outlining the \"myths of the feminist movement\", which became an important tool in the ongoing discussions of inclusion. The ten myths included: 1. feminists are uninterested in power, 2. feminists practice politics in other ways, 3. all feminists are the same, 4. women are naturally united because of their gender, 5. feminism is only a policy of women towards women, 6. the movement is only small groups of women, 7. having specified spaces for women guarantees processes will be positive, 8. feminists apologize for being woman, 9. personal feminism is automatically political, and 10. consensus is democracy. By reiterating their differences and discussing them, there was recognition that the myths were the source of frustration and that their diversity did not necessarily divide their purpose. By acknowledging that it was not necessary for them to select a hegemonic path nor a homogeneous one, they were able to resolve the differences between them and recognize that feminism wasn't a concept that could be possessed or owned by any one group and that greater inclusion expanded their reach.\n\nThe Fifth \"Encuentro\" was held in San Bernardo del Tuyú in 1990 with around 3,200 participants. There was a marked increase in the number of networks throughout the region confirming that identity strategies had replaced the previous discussion of whether feminism should move forward in autonomous groups. The lesbian feminist network which had formed at an earlier conference and the Latin American and Caribbean Black Women’s Network formed in San Bernardo, were two of the organizations striving to build solidarity with the feminist movement through addressing the specific areas of marginalization. Organized by a committee of Argentines and Uruguayans, the event was planned to take place at the union hall of the Argentine Federation of Light and Power Workers (), but the venue was canceled abruptly for political reasons. Instead the community opened doors to malls, gyms, cafés, hotel lobbies and meeting rooms to facilitate the women.\n\nThe focus of the meeting were the challenges and responses to those challenges for feminism in the 1990s, with an acknowledgement that diversity enriched the movement, but in turn caused complexity and conflicts. Specific topics on building bridges with other social actors, and political perspectives and strategies. These main topics led to discussion on a variety of issues, including culture, daily life, education, economics, health, identity, labor, power, sexuality and other issues. One of the most central challenges addressed was violence against women and a march was held on September 24 supporting an anti-violence stance. Four days later, a second march with more than five thousand women participants mobilized to declare September 28 as the Day of the Right to Abortion. They called not only for the decriminalization of abortion, but also for abolishing laws which punished women who had abortions.\n\nThe Sixth \"Encuentro\" was held in Costa del Sol, El Salvador in 1993 and was plagued by attempts from conservative factions in El Salvador to shut down the conference. A right-wing magazine called \"Gente\" claimed that all of the participants were lesbian and \"possibly infected with AIDs\" and several participants received death threats. The 1,500 participants showed up anyway and there were no violent incidents. The attempt to stop the \"encuentro\" had the opposite effect, bringing publicity and recognition to the women's struggle for equality and a life free from violence. For the first time, Afro-Caribbean women attended as did Andean indigenous women. Through the various workshops, the women focused on methods to incorporate women’s diversity in building the movement and avenues to work inside and outside patriarchal systems.\n\nHaving thought the issue of whether feminism was an elitist movement was behind them, participants reminded of the divide when women from poverty-stricken, rural environments complained about the posh accommodations. In addition, coming just after the end of the Salvadoran Civil War, revolutionary dogmatism resurfaced and organizers worked to regain ground about inclusiveness. A major development at the conference was the discussion of preparation for the World Conference on Women, 1995 to be held in Beijing. Many of the participant at the \"encuentro\" were unaware of the UN Decade for Women and were fearful of accepting money from United States Agency for International Development (USAID) to attend, given the inverntionist US policies in Latin America of the past. They were in agreement that the NGO Forum leader should not be the conservative Chilean businesswoman who had been appointed to head the Latin discussion in Beijing, but were not in agreement with the way that some members had gone about replacing the Chilean with a feminist without bringing nominations to the group at large. Overall, enthusiasm to participate in Beijing was high and participants left the conference making plans to attend.\n\nThe Seventh \"Encuentro\" was held in Cartagena, Chile in 1996 and was best by internal struggles. A small group of autonomist feminists, as opposed to women working within institutions, were in charge, as a broader range of Chilean feminists had been unwilling to work with the organizing committee. The conference was boycotted by the majority of Chilean feminists and attendance was significantly lower than previous events. Estimates vary on the participation, but generally agree there were less than 700 delegates, principally because the organizing group refused to include anyone they deemed to be insufficiently feminist, branding those who had integrated with government organizations or formalized their organization as sell-outs to patriarchy and capitalism.\n\nThree themes had been selected, political and philosophical frameworks; invisibility and discrimination; and strategies for change; however, the rigidity of the organizers, allowing only prepared papers to be read without discussion or participation were seen by many as violating the spirit of the \"encuentros\". A group of 300-400 women split off from the designated discussion sessions, forming a third group calling themselves \"neither one or the other\" and tried to find a way to solve the polarization. To this group, whether an NGO did or did not have funding, was or was not official or was grassroots, was irrelevant, if they could forward the transformation of women's lives and society. The combative style of the autonomists and their personal attacks, prohibited discussion on issues with which the majority of participants were concerned. Despite the divides, planning was set for another conference three years hence.\n\nThe Eighth \"Encuentro\" was held in Juan Dolio in the Dominican Republic in November 1999. Organizers pushed the dissension of the previous conference into the background, focusing instead on building feminist camaraderie. Focusing on feminine values and a dynamic cultural interaction, including theater, dance and art, Dominican organizers were able to bridge divides. In addition, the conference, the first one with wide participation of non-Hispanic Caribbean women brought together nearly 1,300 participants to discuss the themes of domination of women, the dynamics of power relationships, and forging regional alliances.\n\nThe sharing of \"herstories\" and the Dominican organizers' goal of creating space for both those who wanted to experience shared time with other women and those who wanted to strategize served as a healing process for participants. The conference was not without conflict, as the relationship between Dominican and Haitian women and the intense racism faced by Haitians living in the Dominican Republic spilled into the conference. Some Haitian participants felt they were marginalized because of inadequate translation services at the conference. But in the tone of reconciliation, petitions were circulated to protest deportation of Haitian immigrants. The \"encuentro\" also pointed to the divide between members of the Anglo-, Fracophone and Hispanic Caribbean, not only in terms of language, but in terms of inclusion and the diaspora, as it opened conversation on whether Caribbeans living abroad were seen as elites.\n\nThe Ninth \"Encuentro\" was held in Playa Tambor, Costa Rica from 1–5 December 2002 on the theme of \"Active Resistance in the Face of Neoliberal Globalization\". The event was attended by 820 women representing 20 countries from throughout the region. As had been seen in the previous \"encuentro\" there was little participation from the Anglo- and Franco-Caribbean and surprisingly little attendance by indigenous women; however, the organizers learned from the previous conference and provided translation services at all group sessions from Spanish into English, French and Portuguese. A novel approach had been taken to financing the conference and for the first time, fees were not the main source of revenues and constituted only one-third of the revenues. For the first time, funds from such organizations as the Global Fund for Women, Mama Cash, UNIFEM and other funding organizations were utilized to make up a third of the cost with the final one-third coming from fundraising.\n\nThe women evaluated both the negative and positive aspects of globalization, providing greater opportunities to women and simultaneously harming them. For example, mproved communications technologies have allowed women to have greater communication with others in the movement and expand their message and yet, it is difficult for women to find funding for initiatives. Economically and politically, they noted the double standard using financial resources to simultaneously support conflict and social improvement, the problem of policies which reinforce patriarchy and the continued effects of poverty and violence, which spiraling national debt caused by neoliberalism has acerbated.\n\nThe Tenth \"Encuentro\" was held in Serra Negra in 2005 and was made up of more than 1,250 participants from 26 countries. The theme of the event was \"Radicalization of feminism, radicalization of democracy\" and evaluated whether democracy could eliminate discrimination and inequalities with its patriarchal structure. There was discussion of how taking on identities such as Black, mestiza, lesbian, among others is a political statement, challenging the cultural norms. Acknowledging the identity is both empowering and leads to anguish. Recognizing that the promise of democracy was government by the people, which left women out, created a disproportionate impoverishment and led to discrimination, which can only be expunged if women actively participate and demand their autonomy.\n\nIt was the first of the conferences to discuss in-depth the diversity of age, ethnicity, race and sexual identity and how those differences alter the complexities involved in developing a feminist strategy. Debate included evaluating feminist racism, power, and representation of research subjects and their objectification. There was also a recognition that women's rights, or even human rights, as defined by the dominant culture, are practiced in the realm of exclusion. Because of the patriarchal nature of rights and law, only men have been fully legally protected. The challenge for feminists is to develop means that their own autonomy and collective rights are protected and valued.\n\nThe Eleventh Encuentro was held in Mexico City from March 16 to 20, 2009, with approximately 1,600 participants. Many of the issues from the previous \"encuentro\" were brought to the fore, including a session in which indigenous women discussed their objectification, as well as the issues of autonomy and accepting funding from governmental type agencies which are patriarchal.\n\nNew issues at the conference were the inclusion of trans-women which some felt had been included without input from the collective group and the issue of using sexual violence to subdue opposition in armed conflict. Repudiation of femicide and ongoing violence against women was not a new theme, but developing strategies to protect women in conflict situations and keeping the situation from being buried became a focal point.\n\nThe Twelfth \"Encuentro\" was held in Bogotá, from 23 to 26 November 2011 with around 1,200 in attendance. For the first time, the group was split with autonomous feminists attending sessions from the 18 to 21 November and then the traditional \"encuentro\" occurring at the later date with institutional feminists as well as autonomists. Topics discussed included inclusion of trans-women, abortion, armed conflict, social class, ecology, race, refugees, and sexuality, among others. The contentious discussions of whether utilizing funds from patriarchal institutions undermined feminism were discussed again. Many felt that as long as there is transparency, the use of such funding sources did not compromise the struggles.\n\nThe Thirteenth \"Encuentro\" was held in Lima, from 22 to 25 November 2014. The topics of the three main sessions were interculturality and intersectionality, sustainable life, and the body and territory. For each session a seminar was organized and discussion followed. The sessions discussed a multitude of issues, such as how to maintain one's identity and economic productivity when patriarchal systems devalue women's contributions, whether binary categories of sexuality are limiting to a full discussion of feminism, finding balance between men and women as well as between humans and nature, marginalization, political participation, among others. The discussion surrounding the intersectionality showed how feminism and creating strategy for policy overlaps and affects peasants, intellectuals, diverse sexualities, different classes, races, making it imperative that all diversity have a place in the discussion. At this conference, there was a full incorporation of trans-women for the first time and a discussion on the recognition of sex workers.\n\nTensions were present, in that Afro-Latina and Afro-Caribbean women felt left out of the discussions. Another polarizing issue was whether the next \"encuentro\" should take place in Bolivia or Uruguay. Both sides had supporters and detractors, one side saying that Bolivia would serve to emphasize the marginalization of indigenous women and the other with the view that all women are marginalized and one group should not be given more emphasis than another. Another question concerning the location was the cost and preparedness. In the final vote, Uruguay won the nod.\n\n"}

The founding members were two liberal and distinctively pro-Europeanist parties: the Italian Radicals (RI), whose leading members included Emma Bonino (a former minister of International Commerce and Foreign Affairs), Riccardo Magi and Marco Cappato, and Forza Europa (FE), led by Benedetto Della Vedova, a former Radical elected in 2013 with Future and Freedom (FLI) and later transitated through Civic Choice (SC). The RI and FE were joined by individual members of the Civics and Innovators (CI) sub-group in the Chamber of Deputies, formed by former SC members (two CI deputies, Andrea Mazziotti and Stefano Dambruoso, were already involved with FE).\n\nAngelo Bonelli, coordinator of the Federation of the Greens, had earlier proposed to the Radicals a joint list together with Giuliano Pisapia's Progressive Camp (CP) named \"Ecology, Europe, Rights\".

{"id": "56840147", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=56840147", "title": "NAIBER", "text": "NAIBER\n\nNAIBER is an acronym for non-accelerating inflation buffer employment ratio and refers to a systemic proposal for an in-built inflation control mechanism devised by economists Bill Mitchell and Warren Mosler, and advocated by Modern Money Theory as replacement for NAIRU (non-accelerating inflation rate of unemployment). The concept of NAIBER is related to the idea of a Job Guarantee aimed to create full employment and price stability, by having the state promise to hire unemployed workers as an employer of last resort (ELR).\n\nIf the Phillips curve displays hysteresis - that is, if episodes of high unemployment raise the NAIRU - the NAIRU analysis is especially problematic. This could happen, for example, if unemployed workers lose skills so that employers prefer to bid up of the wages of existing workers when demand increases, rather than hiring the unemployed. Economists as Abba Lerner and Hyman Minsky have argued that a similar effect can be achieved without the human costs of unemployment via a Job Guarantee (JG), where rather than being unemployed, those who cannot find work in the private sector should be employed by the government. This theory, and the policy of the JG replaces the NAIRU with the NAIBER (non-accelerating inflation buffer employment ratio).\n\nThe \"buffer employment ratio\" (BER) is the ratio of JG employment to total employment. The BER conditions the overall rate of wage demands. When the BER is high, real wage demands will be correspondingly lower. If inflation exceeds the government’s announced target, tighter fiscal and monetary policy would be triggered to increase the BER, which entails workers transferring from the inflating sector to the fixed price JG sector. Ultimately this attenuates the inflation spiral. So instead of a buffer stock of unemployed being used to discipline the distributional struggle, the JG policy achieves this via compositional shifts in employment. Replacing the current \"non-accelerating inflation rate of unemployment\" (NAIRU), the BER that results in stable inflation is called the \"non-accelerating inflation buffer employment ratio\" (NAIBER). It is a full employment steady state JG level, which is dependent on a range of factors including the path of the economy.\n\n\n"}

It achieved notoriety during the time of the Spanish Second Republic. The PG grouped a number of historical Galician intellectuals, and was fundamental in the elaboration of the Galician Statute of Autonomy.\n\nIn December 1931 the \"\" (Galicianist Party of Pontevedra), directed by Castelao and Alexandre Bóveda, called for a General Nationalist Assembly in order to create an all-Galician nationalist party. A total of 32 Galicianist organizations attended, including the \"Irmandades da Fala\" (Brotherhoods of the Language) and the \"Partido Nazonalista Republicán de Ourense\" (Republican Nationalist Party of Ourense), among others.\n\nThe PG was a plural party hosting different political tendencies, and where internal tensions were not uncommon. The PG initially embraced:\n\n\nThe political programme of the PG revolved around the ideals established by the \"Irmandades da Fala\", that is, considering Galicia as a cultural unit entitled to political self-determination. In order to achieve this the minimum required was forming a Galician Parliament and a Galician Government. It also aimed at eliminating clientelism, supporting anti-imperialism and equal rights for the women. Furthermore, the PG claimed for the suppression of the provincial governments (perceived as a redundant administrative structure) and the establishment of the parish as an official territorial tier. Official status for the Galician language and agrarian reform were also in the agenda.\n\nIndependence was never a priority for the PG, as independentists were a minority within the party. It was thought that Galicia could operate within the framework of a Spanish federal republic. Yet, War and the impossibility to establish such a federal republic led to disappointment. In a later stage, around 1944, PG's president and intellectual leader, Castelao, began to consider the option of full independence.\n\nMembers of the PG expressed a strong pro-Europeanism, situating the party ahead of its time on this issue. They also supported the strengthening of the League of Nations (predecessor of the UN) as a tool to solve international conflicts. In 1933, the PG successfully requested the admission of Galicia into the League as a stateless nation. Those negotiations were conducted by Plácido Castro.\n\nIn 1932 the PG works alongside the \"Partido Republicano Gallego\" (Galician Republican Party) and \"Acción Republicana\" (Republican Action) in the drafting and promotion of the Statute of Autonomy. The PG negotiates a number of pacts with local parties and in 1933 it takes part in the local elections, obtaining a single local deputy for Ourense. This issue opens the debate in the PG, as some wanted to seek alliances with republican parties (left-wing), something which was frontally rejected by the conservatives.\n\nThe conservative pressure within the party forces PG to take part at the 1933 general Spanish elections on its own. The 106,000 votes obtained are not enough to grant a seat at the Spanish Parliament. Furthermore, the new conservative Spanish government halts the development of the Statute of Autonomy, bans PG's newspaper \"A Nosa Terra\", and relocates Castelao and Bóveda far from Galicia (they were civil servants).\n\nIn its Third Assembly, January 1934, the PG eventually decides to ally with left-wing republican parties, with the opposition of Vicente Risco. This decision is ratified in the Fourth Assembly, April 1935, this time with the opposition of Otero Pedrayo. Thus, the conservative sector leaves the PG to found \"Dereita Galeguista\" (Galicianist Right-Wing). The PG then openly becomes a left-wing party.\n\nIn June 1935 the PG initiates negotiations with \"Izquierda Republicana\" (Republican Left), and in January 1936 the PG decides to integrate itself in the \"Frente Popular\" (Popular Front). Hence, the PG presented five Galicianist candidates to the Spanish general election of 1936, namely: Castelao, Bóveda, Xerardo Álvarez Gallego, Ramón Suárez Picallo and Antón Villar Ponte.\n\nIn the province of Lugo the PG ran on its own, since specific pacts for that province could not be formalized, thus obtaining no representatives. However, out of the five candidates the PG obtains three seats in the Spanish Parliament. These are Castelao, Súarez Picallo and Vilar Ponte, with a combined total of some 287,000 votes. As a consequence, in June 1936 the Statute of Autonomy is put to the vote with the help of the \"Frente Popular\", and the \"yes\" wins with an overwhelming majority.\n\nFollowing the revolt of general Francisco Franco in July 1936, and the start of the Spanish Civil War, normal political life comes to an end. Galicia soon falls under the control of Franco's Nationalist troops and PG members are prosecuted. Some of them are captured and executed, such as Johán Carballeira, Ánxel Casal, Manuel Lustres Rivas, Camilo Díaz Baliño, Víctor Casas or one of the main leaders of the party, Alexandre Bóveda. Others are forced into exile, like the president of the party, Castelao, who was in Madrid when the war started and managed to flee.\n\nIn 1937 the PG establishes a delegation in Barcelona, still a republican area, and publishes the magazine \"Nova Galicia\" between April 1937 and July 1938. Castelao and Suárez Picallo call for the unity of all democratic forces in Spain to preserve the Republic, while maintaining the Galicianist ideals. In 1938, after the fall of Barcelona, the Galicianists in the area move to France and from there to South America.\n\nAs soon as the Civil War ended in 1939, Galicianists tried to get in touch again in order to rebuild the party in Galicia. The PG appeared in the underground in July 1943, when 19 members meet in Coruxo and decide to form a temporary executive committee, including Manuel Gómez Román, Otero Pedrayo and Plácido Castro. Yet, in this new period, Francisco Fernández del Riego and Ramón Piñeiro had the most active role.\n\nOne of the priorities was to establish contacts with the rest of the Galician opposition to the Francoist regime, and also with Basque and Catalan nationalists. In 1944 the PG forms together with the Spanish Socialist Party, CNT, UGT, and other trade unions, the \"Junta Gallega de Alianza Democrática\" (Galician Union for the Democratic Alliance).\n\nRamón Piñeiro was detained in 1946. Fermín Penzol took responsibility for keeping contact with the other organizations. With the release of Piñeiro in 1949, and in the light that the underground activity did not produce any palpable results, the PG led by Piñeiro decides to prioritise the defence of Galician culture, gradually abandoning the political activity. This was severely criticised by the Galicianists in exile. Hence, the foundation of the \"\" publishing house, in 1950 marks the self-dissolution of the PG in Galicia. From that date militants in Galicia take part in the new cultural strategy, which revolved around \"Galaxia\".\n\nIn 1932 a branch of the PG was created in Buenos Aires, Argentina. This was the \"Organizacion Nazionalista Repubricana Galega\" (Galician Republican Nationalist Organization). It had 150 members and was led by Rodolfo Prada. At the time of the Civil War it changes its name to \"Grupo Galeguista de Bos Aires\" (Galicianist Group of Buenos Aires). In 1941 it takes the name of \"Irmandade Galega\" (Galician Brotherhood). In 1942, with the massive arrival or Galician expatriates to Buenos Aires (including Castelao), this same group relaunches the PG newspaper \"A Nosa Terra\". In 1944, \"Irmandade Galega\", with the support of Castelao, establish the \"Consello de Galiza\", a sort of Galician government in exile.\n\nThere was also a branch of the PG in Uruguay, named \"Irmandade Galeguista do Uruguai\", led my Manuel Meilán. In 1949 the PG only had a total of some 200 active militants scattered around Buenos Aires and other Argentinian cities, Montevideo (Uruguay), Mexico and Havana (Cuba).

More in general, a food supply chain can be defined as \"short\" when it is characterized by short distance or few intermediaries between producers and consumers.\n\nSFSCs were originally identified as examples of \"resistance\" of farmers to modernization of the food system, characterized by the development of supply chains based on long-distance trade. Resistance consists in the fact that, by selling directly to consumers, farmers bypass intermediaries and thus can develop autonomous marketing strategies based on differentiation. These strategies give farmers the possibility of keeping a bigger share of the value added within the farm and within the local economies. Given these characteristics, short food supply chains are increasingly taken into consideration by rural and food policies as a driver of change in the food system and a policy tool for rural development.\n\nThe analysis of short food supply chains has fed a broader debate on \"alternative food chains\", \"alternative food networks\", and \"sustainable food chains\".\n\nSFSCs are considered the most appropriate channels for organic and locally specific products and for small farmers. In fact, a closer relation between producers and consumers gives producers the opportunity to develop a richer communication, and to identify market niches. Ilbery and Maye state, “the crucial characteristic of SFSCs is that foods which reach the final consumer have been transmitted through an SC that is 'embedded' with value-laden information concerning the mode of production, provenance, and distinctive quality assets of the product”. Likewise, Marsden et al. (2000) state that “a common characteristic, however, is the emphasis upon the type of relationship between the producer and the consumer in these supply chains, and the role of this relationship in constructing value and meaning, rather than solely the type of product itself”.\n\nIn order to develop a definition of SFSCs, there are a number of candidate criteria that may be used. SFSCs have been conceptualized in terms of Dimensions of Proximity. Kebir and Torre (2012) were perhaps some of the first to propose such a conceptualization, classifying SFSCs based on two dimensions: Geographical Proximity and \"Organized\" Proximity, the latter of which incorporates social notions of Belonging and Similarity. Other dimensions have been proposed, including [citations needed]: \nSFSCs are classified by Renting et al. into face-to-face, proximate, extended. Face to face are characterized by physical encounters between producers and consumers (as in the case of farmers' markets). In the proximate short food supply chains producers are not necessarily managing product distribution (as in the case of consumers' cooperatives). In the extended short food supply chains, although geographical distances between producers and consumers may be long, consumers are aware of the identity of the producers and of the products (such as in the case of fair trade and protected denominations of origin).\n\nAn action plan developed in 2009 at the Ministry of Agriculture, Agrifood, and Forestry of France was aimed at supporting the development of short food chains. According to the plan, short food chains are defined on the base of the number of actors involved; precisely : SFSC are considered as « \"commercialisation of agricultural products through direct selling or indirect selling when only one intermediary is involved\" ». (« \"Un circuit court est un mode de commercialisation des produits agricoles qui s'exerce soit par la vente directe du producteur au consommateur, soit par la vente indirecte à condition qu'il n'y ait qu'un seul intermédiaire\". » .\n\nHowever, there have been discussions at the senate and at regional levels that short-ness should not be reduced to the number of intermediaries but also geographical distance should be considered (f.i., one can buy vine directly, but what if it travels 1,000 km?). Following the national action plan (or maybe prior to it in some cases), regional SFSC plans have been developed. Regional action plans refer to the definition above, but they also complement or precise it. F.i. Aquitaine region also adds short or reduced geographical distance between producers and consumers (link).\nThe French Law on modernisation of agriculture and fishing, updated in 2010 (n° 2010-874), among its many other intervention actions also states «\"the development of short food chains and facilitation of geographical proximity between producers and processors\". »\n\nFarmers' markets, are physical retail markets featuring foods sold directly by farmers to consumers.\n\nCommunity-supported agriculture (CSA), network or association of individuals who have pledged to support one or more local farms, with growers and consumers sharing the risks and benefits of food production. The URGENCI network federates initiatives of CSA from all over the world.\n\nAMAP (\"French Associations pour le maintien d'une agriculture paysanne\") support peasant and organic agriculture through direct links between farmers and consumers\n\n\n"}

In the first phase, from 1956 until 1961, the activists focussed on symbolic targets such as relics of the fascist regime, trying to avoid physical injuries of human beings. On 12 June 1961, the BAS organized the bombing of 37 electricity pylons supplying power to the industrial zone of Bolzano, later known as the Night of Fire (\"Feuernacht\"). After the subsequent imprisonment of almost all leading members, a second, more violent phase began. This second phase was characterised by an increasing infiltration of Austrian and German neo-Nazis and intensified secret service activities which culminated in several assassinations and ambushes on Italian security forces. With the progression of negotiations concerning South Tyrolean autonomy in the late 1960s, the BAS became less active. \n"}

The State Opening of Parliament is one of the few occasions when a State Procession is to be seen; the Coronation Procession is another. The State Procession is now confined to the interior of the Palace of Westminster, but in earlier centuries it followed an outdoor route to and from Westminster Abbey.\n\nAn account of Henry VII opening Parliament on 7 November 1485 includes a description of the processions which preceded it. By this time the pattern had become established whereby the Peers of the Realm would assemble at the Palace of Westminster (which was the King's principal residence). They would then go in procession on foot to nearby Westminster Abbey for Mass, prior to returning in procession to the Palace for the Opening of Parliament itself. (During the Mass, the Knights and Burgesses who had been elected to represent the Commons would gather in the Parliament Chamber for a roll-call, overseen by the Lord Steward who would leave the Abbey early for this purpose.)\n\nIn due course, the heralds, who had the responsibility (under the Earl Marshal's direction) for marshaling the procession, began to keep detailed records of the event, the earliest of which dates from Henry VIII's first Opening of Parliament in 1510. The 1512 account includes an illustration of the Procession depicting participants together with their armorial bearings. It shows the Lords Spiritual at the front of the procession, accompanied by Heralds and Gentlemen Ushers; the Serjeants-at-Arms follow with their maces, just ahead of Garter King of Arms. The King is preceded by the Cap of Maintenance, borne by the Lord High Constable and the Sword of State, borne by his son. The King himself carries a scepter and walks beneath a richly-decorated canopy supported by four monks. His train is borne by the Lord Great Chamberlain, who is assisted by the Lord Chamberlain (with his white wand of office). The Lords Temporal follow, among whom can be seen the Lord Steward (carrying his white wand of office).\n\nChange was necessitated after the Palace of Westminster was severely damaged by fire in 1514. In both 1523 and 1529, the Opening of Parliament took place in Bridewell Palace, following a service in nearby Blackfriars Church. At around this time, Westminster ceased to be a royal residence, becoming instead the fixed abode of Parliament itself. In 1536, the procession set off from the new royal residence of Whitehall. Three years later, the King, Peers and attendants were to be seen riding in procession from Whitehall to the Abbey, in their robes and on horseback. This precedent was followed in subsequent years; Elizabeth I rode on occasion or else was carried in a horse-borne litter (as had been her sister Queen Mary, a practice that would also be followed by Queen Anne over a century later). On occasion (and especially in times of plague) the King would travel by river from Whitehall to Westminster, using a State Barge.\n\nFor the 1679 State Opening, there was no procession and no service in the Abbey (for fear of a Popish Plot). The service was not reinstated, so subsequent processions went directly from the Palace of Whitehall to the Palace of Westminster. At about this time, the practice of all Peers taking part in the procession ceased (due in no small part to the increasing size of the Peerage). In 1698, Whitehall Palace burned down; thereafter St James's became the usual point of departure. In the Georgian period, carriages began regularly to be used for the procession to Westminster (though this was not entirely new - both Elizabeth I (on occasion) and Oliver Cromwell had used carriages to get to the State Opening). Under George IV, the Palace of Westminster was remodeled by Sir John Soane to provide space for the carriages, a robing room, and a grand interior processional route to the House of Lords.\n\nThe Old Palace of Westminster was largely destroyed by fire in 1834. The new Palace was purpose built (among other things) to accommodate the ceremonial of a State Opening. Thus in Victoria's reign, the long-established ceremonial of the State Opening was married to its now-familiar architectural setting of Barry and Pugin's grand parliamentary interiors. The pattern of events then was much as it is now: the monarch, members of the Royal Family and members of the Household arrive in a Carriage Procession from Buckingham Palace (preceded by the items of royal regalia with their attendants); after a time of preparation, the monarch proceeds in State from the Queen's Robing Room, through the Royal Gallery and Prince's Chamber, to the Throne in the House of Lords.\n\nThe Procession falls into four main sections:\nIt should be noted that the latter contingent includes a combination of royal officials and attendants, plus others who are there by virtue of holding honorary positions in the Royal Household (namely several Government Whips and the professional heads of the Armed Services).\n\nAs of 2016, the Procession is constituted as follows:\n\nThe Lord Chamberlain of the Household always used to take part (as one of the three great officers of the Household), but since the time of Charles II he has remained instead at the monarch's residence where he holds a Member of Parliament 'hostage' pending the monarch's safe return.\n\nUntil 1998 two Gentleman Ushers were in the procession, in addition to the Gentleman Usher of the Black Rod and the Gentleman Usher to the Sword of State (who conveys the sword to and from the Palace of Westminster). Gentleman Ushers have been in attendance at State Openings since at least the 15th century.\n\nUntil 1998 the Queen was attended by three Ladies in Waiting: a Woman of the Bedchamber, a Lady of the Bedchamber and the Mistress of the Robes; subsequently only two of the three have attended.\n\nIn the first year of her reign the Groom of the Robes attended, and walked immediately behind the Queen; since then no new appointment has been made; one of the Equerries is instead designated 'Acting Groom of the Robes' for the occasion.\n\nUntil 1998 the executive senior officers of the various corps on duty were in the procession (the Lieutenant of the Gentleman at Arms, the Lieutenant of the Yeomen of the Guard, Silver Stick and the Field Officer in Brigade Waiting) as well as the Crown Equerry (the executive head of the Royal Mews). They do not now take part in the procession, but are still in attendance elsewhere in and around the Palace.\n\nOn some occasions, other senior members of the Royal Family have walked in the procession and occupied positions on the dais either side of the throne (sometimes accompanied by their spouses). The Princess Royal attended on eleven occasions in this capacity (between 1967 and 1985) though in recent years she has attended in her official capacity as Gold Stick-in-Waiting. The Prince of Wales attended on sixteen occasions between 1967 and 1996 (on four of those occasions he was escorting The Queen in The Duke of Edinburgh's absence). Since 2013 the Prince of Wales and the Duchess of Cornwall have been in regular attendance.\n\nPrior to the passing of the House of Lords Act 1999, other members of the Royal Family who were Peers or Peeresses (including Dowagers) often used to attend the State Opening; they, however, were seated on the benches of the chamber with their peers and did not form part of the Procession.\n\n"}
{"id": "1257960", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1257960", "title": "State of Fear", "text": "State of Fear\n\nState of Fear is a 2004 techno-thriller novel by Michael Crichton, in which eco-terrorists plot mass murder to publicize the danger of global warming. Despite being a work of fiction, the book contains many graphs and footnotes, two appendices, and a 20-page bibliography in support of Crichton's beliefs about global warming. Many Climate scientists, science journalists, environmental groups, and science advocacy organisations dispute Crichton's views on the science as being error-filled and distorted.\n\nThe novel had an initial print run of 1.5 million copies and reached the #1 bestseller position at Amazon and #2 on \"The New York Times\" Best Seller list for one week in January 2005. The novel itself has garnered mixed reviews, with some literary reviewers stating that the book's presentation of facts and stance on the global warming debate detracted from the book's plot.\n\n\"State of Fear\" is, like many of Crichton's books, a fictional work that uses a mix of speculation and real world data, plus technological innovations as fundamental storyline devices. The debate over global warming serves as the backdrop for the book. Crichton supplies a personal afterword and two appendices that link the fictional part of the book with real examples of his thesis.\n\nThe main villains in the plot are environmental extremists. Crichton does place blame on \"industry\" in both the plot line and the appendices. Various assertions appear in the book, for example:\n\n\nNumerous charts and quotations from real world data, including footnoted charts which strongly suggest mean global temperature is, in this era, lowering. Where local temperatures show a general rise in mean temperature, mostly in major world cities, Crichton's characters infer it is due to urban sprawl and deforestation, not carbon emissions.\n\nCrichton argues for removing politics from science and uses global warming and real-life historical examples in the appendices to make this argument. In a 2003 speech at the California Institute of Technology, he expressed his concern about what he considered the \"emerging crisis in the whole enterprise of science—namely the increasingly uneasy relationship between hard science and public policy.\"\n\nPeter Evans is a lawyer for a millionaire philanthropist, George Morton. Evans' main duties are managing the legal affairs surrounding Morton's contributions to an environmentalist organization, the National Environmental Resource Fund (NERF) (modeled after the Natural Resources Defense Council [NRDC]).\n\nMorton becomes suspicious of NERF's director, Nicholas Drake, after he discovers that Drake has misused some of the funds Morton had donated to the group. Soon after, Morton is visited by two men, John Kenner and Sanjong Thapa, who appear on the surface to be researchers at MIT, but, in fact, are international law enforcement agents on the trail of an eco-terrorist group, the Environmental Liberation Front (ELF) (modeled on the Earth Liberation Front). The ELF is attempting to create \"natural\" disasters to convince the public of the dangers of global warming. All these events are timed to happen during a NERF-sponsored climate conference that will highlight the \"catastrophe\" of global warming. The eco-terrorists have no qualms about how many people are killed in their manufactured \"natural\" disasters and ruthlessly assassinate anyone who gets in their way (their preferred methods being ones few would recognize as murder; the venom of a rare Australian blue-ringed octopus which causes paralysis, and \"lightning attractors\" which cause their victims to get electrocuted in electrical storms). Kenner and Thapa suspect Drake of involvement with the ELF to further his own ends (garnering more donations to NERF from the environmentally-minded public).\n\nEvans joins Kenner, Thapa, and Morton's assistant, Sarah Jones, on a globe-spanning series of adventures to thwart various ELF-manufactured disasters before these disasters kill thousands of people. Kenner's niece, Jennifer Haynes, joins the group for the final leg as they travel to a remote island in the Solomon Islands to stop the ELF's \"pièce de résistance\", a tsunami that will inundate the coastline of California just as Drake is winding up the international conference on the \"catastrophe\" of global warming. Along the way they battle man-eating crocodiles and cannibalistic tribesmen (who feast on Ted Bradley, an environmentalist TV actor whom Drake had sent to spy on Kenner and his team). The rest of the group are rescued in the nick of time by Morton, who had previously faked his own death to throw Drake off the trail so that he could keep watch on the ELF's activities on the island while he waited for Kenner and his team to arrive. \n\nThe group has a final confrontation with the elite ELF team on the island during which Haynes is almost killed, and Evans kills one of the terrorists who had previously tried to kill both him and Jones in Antarctica. The rest of the ELF team is killed by the backwash from their own tsunami, which Kenner and his team have sabotaged just enough to prevent it from becoming a full-size tsunami and reaching California. \n\nMorton, Evans, and Jones return to Los Angeles. Evans quits the firm to work for Morton's new (unnamed) organization, which will practice environmental activism as a business, free from potential conflicts of interest. He hopes Evans and Jones will take his place in the new organization after his death.\n\nSeveral critics have suggested that Crichton uses the major characters as proxies for differing viewpoints on the topic of global warming in order to allow the reader to clearly follow the various positions portrayed in the book.\n\n\nCrichton included a statement of his views on global climate change as an afterword. In the \"Author's message\", Crichton states that the cause, extent, and threat of climate change are largely unknown. He finishes by endorsing the management of wilderness and the continuation of research into all aspects of the Earth's environment.\n\nIn Appendix I, Crichton warns both sides of the global warming debate against the politicization of science. Here he provides two examples of the disastrous combination of pseudoscience and politics: the early 20th-century ideas of eugenics (which he directly cites as one of the theories that allowed for the Holocaust) and Lysenkoism.\n\nThis appendix is followed by a bibliography of 172 books and journal articles that Crichton presents \"...\"to assist those readers who would like to review my thinking and arrive at their own conclusions.\"\" (\"State of Fear\", pp, 583).\n\nThe novel has received mixed reviews from professional literary reviewers.\n\n\"The Wall Street Journal\"<nowiki>'</nowiki>s Ronald Bailey gave a favorable review, calling it \"a lightning-paced technopolitical thriller\" and the \"novelization of a speech that Mr. Crichton delivered in September 2003 at San Francisco's Commonwealth Club.\" \"Entertainment Weekly\"'s Gregory Kirschling gave a favorable A- review and said it was \"one of Crichton's best because it's as hard to pigeonhole as greenhouse gas but certainly heats up the room.\"\n\nIn \"The New Republic\", Sacha Zimmerman gave a mixed review. Zimmerman criticized Crichton's presentation of data as condescending to the reader but concluded that the book was a \"globe-trotting thriller that pits man against nature in brutal spectacles while serving up just the right amount of international conspiracy and taking digs at fair-weather environmentalists.\"\n\nMuch criticism was given to Crichton's presentation of global warming data and the book's portrayal of the global warming debate as a whole. In the \"Sydney Morning Herald\", John Birmingham criticized the book's usage of real world research and said it was \"boring after the first lecture, but mostly in the plotting... It's bad writing and it lets the reader ignore the larger point Crichton is trying to make.\" In \"The Guardian\", Peter Guttridge wrote that the charts and research in the book got \"in the way of the thriller elements\" and stated the bibliography was more interesting than the plot. In \"The New York Times\", Bruce Barcott criticized the novel's portrayal of the global warming debate heavily, stating that it only presented one side of the argument.\n\nIn the \"Pittsburgh Post-Gazette\", Allan Walton gave a mostly favorable review and offered some praise for Crichton's work. Walton wrote that Crichton's books, \"as meticulously researched as they are, have an amusement park feel. It's as if the author channels one of his own creations, \"Jurassic Park's\" John Hammond, and spares no expense when it comes to adventure, suspense and, ultimately, satisfaction.\"\n\nThis novel received criticism from climate scientists, science journalists and environmental groups for inaccuracies and misleading information. Sixteen of 18 US climate scientists interviewed by Knight Ridder said the author was bending scientific data and distorting research.\n\nSeveral scientists whose research had been referenced in the novel stated that Crichton had distorted it in the novel. Peter Doran, leading author of the \"Nature\" paper, wrote in the \"New York Times\": \"our results have been misused as 'evidence' against global warming by Michael Crichton in his novel 'State of Fear.\n\nMyles Allen, Head of the Climate Dynamics Group, Department of Physics, University of Oxford, wrote in \"Nature\" in 2005: Michael Crichton's latest blockbuster, \"State of Fear\", is also on the theme of global warming and is, ...likely to mislead the unwary... Although this is a work of fiction, Crichton's use of footnotes and appendices is clearly intended to give an impression of scientific authority.The American Geophysical Union, consisting of over 50,000 members from over 135 countries, states in their newspaper \"Eos\" in 2006, \"We have seen from encounters with the public how the political use of \"State of Fear\" has changed public perception of scientists, especially researchers in global warming, toward suspicion and hostility.\"\n\nJames E. Hansen, former head of the NASA Goddard Institute for Space Studies at the time, wrote that Crichton \"doesn't seem to have the foggiest notion about the science that he writes about.\" Jeffrey Masters, chief meteorologist for Weather Underground, writes: \"Crichton presents an error-filled and distorted version of the Global Warming science, favoring views of the handful of contrarians that attack the consensus science of the IPCC.\"\n\nThe Union of Concerned Scientists devote a section of their website to what they describe as misconceptions readers may take away from the book.\n\nDespite being a work of fiction, the book has found use by opponents of global warming. For example, US Senator Jim Inhofe, who once pronounced global warming \"the greatest hoax ever perpetrated on the American people\", made \"State of Fear\" \"required reading\" for the Senate Committee on Environment and Public Works, which he chaired from 2003 to 2007, and before which he called Crichton to testify in September 2005.\n\nAl Gore said on March 21, 2007 before a US House committee: \"The planet has a fever. If your baby has a fever, you go to the doctor [...] if your doctor tells you you need to intervene here, you don't say 'Well, I read a science fiction novel that tells me it's not a problem. Several commentators interpreted this as a reference to \"State of Fear\".\n\nThe novel received the American Association of Petroleum Geologists (AAPG) 2006 Journalism Award. AAPG Communications director Larry Nation told the \"New York Times\", \"It is fiction, but it has the absolute ring of truth\". The presentation of this award has been criticized as a promotion of the politics of the oil industry and for blurring the lines between fiction and journalism. After some controversy within the organization, AAPG has since renamed the award the \"Geosciences in the Media\" Award.\n\nDaniel P. Schrag, Director of the Center for the Environment at Harvard University, called the award \"a total embarrassment\" that he said \"reflects the politics of the oil industry and a lack of professionalism\" on the association's part. As for the book, he added \"I think it is unfortunate when somebody who has the audience that Crichton has shows such profound ignorance\".\n\n"}

Henry Charles Russell, the grandson of the sixth duke of Bedford, and his wife, Leila Louisa Millicent Willoughby, the daughter of the eighth Baron Middleton.\n\nAs the director of the Central Narcotics Intelligence Bureau (CNIB), Russell Pasha became an anti-drug campaigner when he realized that opium, heroin, cocaine and hashish were being smuggled into Egypt in great and increasing quantities.\nHe was educated at Cheam School, Haileybury College, and Trinity College, Cambridge between the years 1899 and 1902. In 1902, he was awarded a B.A.. His choice of career was settled when he was invited to visit Cairo by a distant cousin, then adviser to the Egyptian minister of the interior. He went back home to graduate, entering the Egyptian service in October 1902. An apprenticeship of ten years gave him a good understanding of the Egyptian society as well as the conditions and customs that drove the lives of the Egyptian fellahin.\n\nAfter an apprenticeship with the Alexandria coastguards, he was appointed provincial sub-inspector in the Ministry of Interior, in January 1902. He served later as inspector, in every Egyptian province, acquiring great knowledge of local officials, while directing police activities of all kind. In 1911 he was appointed assistant commandant of police in Alexandria. He was transferred to Cairo as assistant commandant in 1913.\n\nIn 1911 he married Evelyn Dorothea Temple (d.1968), with whom he had one son, Sir John Wriothesley Russell (who was to become British ambassador to Spain in 1969) and one daughter, Camilla Georgiana, who married the writer Christopher Sykes.\n\nIn 1917 he was appointed commandant of the Cairo city police with rank of major-general and title of Pasha.\nAfter 1922 he served under twenty-nine different Egyptian ministers of interior. However, his talents were gradually focused on fighting the spread of drugs and drug addiction in Egypt. In 1929 the Egyptian Central Narcotics Intelligence Bureau (CNIB) was formed, with him as the director. He remained in this position until 1946. There he gained an even more profound understanding of Egyptian society that routine police work could ever have provided. Regarding the formation of the Egyptian Central Narcotics Intelligence Bureau, Russell Pasha writes in his memoirs:\n\nWhile his main focus was on drug related crimes, in his 44 years of police work he also dealt with a large collection of other crimes. They included: many common murders (happening an average of eight times a day in Egypt, mostly committed by fellahin in compensation of their business or personal feuds), as well as the clarification of some big political assassinations in Cairo.\n\nIn his memoirs, Russell Pasha describes hashish and opium as \"black drugs\", and cocaine, morphine and heroin as \"white drugs\". It's the latter, chemical ones that he determined as a \"major danger to the country\" and expresses his decision to \"for a time ignore the black drug traffic, if doing so would get us on to the white\". \nRussell Pasha’s view on the drug and ideas of how to deal with the drug problem were undoubtedly inspired by Britain’s hashish policy in India. The cultivation of cannabis in India was monopolized and its cultivation and sale were taxed and licensed. The possibility of implementing this same policy in India was constantly considered by British officials in Egypt. Three prominent British diplomats in Egypt, in the years preceding the CNIB, had called for policies similar to the one in India to be implemented in Egypt. They were: Alfred Caillard Pasha, the British general director of customs in Egypt; and Evelyn Barring (Lord Cromer) and Lord Herbert Kitchener, both British Consul Generals. They saw that, like in India, hashish was so widely consumed that it would be difficult to completely eradicate its consumption and instead it should be regulated. A law based on that of India’s to regulate, register, and license the manufacturing, selling, and import of hashish was drafted, but never put into effect.\n\nRussell Pasha states in his memoirs that his request to form the CNIB was approved after he provided evidence to the Prime Minister that almost half a million Egyptians, out of a population of fourteen million, were drug addicts.\n\nHe also declares a feeling of fortune about the \"exceptionally efficient team of officers and constables from the Egyptian Police\" that he was able to select. The objects of the Bureau, described in his memoirs, were the following:\n\nDuring the brief French occupation of Egypt in 1798–1801, Napoleon banned hashish preparation and consumption because of the spread of its use among the French military, with little success, however. Mahammed Ali Pasha’s Egyptian government (starting in 1803) was focused on modernizing the state, especially in the area of health. This idea of modernizing medicine could have influenced the hostile attitudes towards hashish as it was an unregulated consumption of drugs. Hashish was banned in Egypt between 1868 and 1884. Muhammad Ali Bey, an important medical doctor (who was going to be later the head of the medical school and the editor of Egypt's first medical journal, \"Ya'sub al-Tibb\"), published a detailed report in 1868 that led to the ban on cultivation, use and importation of hashish. In 1874 hashish was imported under the payment of duty, but in November 1877 an imperial order from Istanbul stipulated that all hashish brought into Egypt was to be destroyed. On March 1879 the Egyptian government banned the cultivation, distribution and importation of the drug in Egypt.\n\nThis prohibition of hashish in Egypt can be seen as a response to an image that started to become popular among European travelers and local Egyptian westernized intellectuals: of the Egyptian lower classes as demented, lethargic, irrational and unproductive hashish smokers and of Egyptian streets carrying the sweet and debilitating smell of hashish smoke. Banning hashish was a step in the direction to becoming a civilized society and a way to discipline the lower classes into rationality. Historically, Egyptians had recourse to the drug as an alternative to wine. Wine, even though prohibited in Islam, was known as the substance for the rich as it was more expensive, while the less expensive hashish was known as a substance for the poor.\n\nThe trafficking of hashish into Egypt in the later part of the nineteenth century and early twentieth century came mostly from Greece. In response to British pressure, Greece increased their prohibition efforts and Syrian and Lebanese suppliers took over the trafficking of hashish, moving it to Egypt through Palestine.\n\nRussell Pasha considered hashish consumption as a relatively innocuous habit, in comparison to the \"plague\" of heroin and cocaine consumption, which became popular after the First World War. Baron Harry D'Erlanger, Russell's associate, similarly declared that hashish was no more than a 'pet failing of many members of the poorer classes'. According to D'Erlanger, Russell considered legalizing the drug, turning it into a revenue-producing good, thus preserving national funds, which would be spent on home-grown products rather than importing from abroad. This consideration echoes those of Caillard, Cromer, and Kitchener, based on the Indian policy. Nahas writes that British officials, and particularly Russell, did not care enough about the drug because they saw hashish intoxication as \"one expression of oriental languid and dreamy temperament\". Even though several British officials supported the legalization of the drug, they continued to enforce the ban and guarded Egyptian borders, ports and shores to get a hold on the small percentage of the hashish that eventually found its way to Egyptian consumers.\n\nRussell Pasha writes in his memoirs:\n\nWriting about those early days he states:\n\nBut then, the situation started to become alarming:\n\nAs described by Russell Pasha in his memoirs, one of the traits of the drug addiction in Egypt was the pitiful desire of many addicts to be cured:\n\nThe international trafficking of hashish (Indian hemp) was made illegal to countries that had criminalized it at the League of Nations' 1925 Opium Convention, after a suggestion made by Egypt. The League of Nations made this 'humanitarian effort' thinking that with international collaboration they could help heal the world's physical and social ills. Russell Pasha’s reports on drugs and hashish to the Home Office in London were passed around the League of Nations Advisory Committee in 1929. Realizing the importance of examining the facts in those reports, Russell Pasha appeared at the Committee in Geneva as the Egyptian representative.\n\nIn January 1931, in a Communication to the League of Nations Special Committee Meeting in Geneva, where Russell Pasha was representing \"the Kingdom of Egypt\", he writes:\n\nAccording to his observations, the majority of the big traffickers in Egypt at that time were the \"Greeks, Turks and Palestinian Jews\". He states:\nIt was lucky for Russell Pasha because if these traffickers were not local subjects, they would have been subject to capitulations, meaning that they were tried in consular courts and were exempt from Egyptian law.\nRegarding the imprisonment of the traffickers, he writes in his memoirs that even if the Egyptian prison code states that a prisoner sentenced for a crime can be released under good conduct after three-quarters of time served, the grace is always denied to these.\n\nIn an obituary written following Russell Pasha’s death in 1954, it is said of him:\n\n\nRussell Pasha retired in 1946 and dedicated the rest of his life to salmon fishing. He died in London on April 10, 1954.\n"}
{"id": "24903878", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=24903878", "title": "USSR anti-religious campaign (1958–1964)", "text": "USSR anti-religious campaign (1958–1964)\n\nNikita Khrushchev's anti-religious campaign was the last large-scale anti-religious campaign undertaken in the Soviet Union. It succeeded a comparatively tolerant period towards religion which had lasted from 1941 until the late 1950s. As a result, the church had grown in stature and membership, provoking concerns from the Soviet government. These concerns resulted in a new campaign of persecution. The aim of anti-religious campaigns was to achieve the atheist society that communism envisioned.\n\nKhrushchev had long held radical views regarding the abolition of religion, and this campaign resulted largely from his own leadership rather than from pressure in other parts of the CPSU. In 1932 he had been the First Moscow City Party Secretary and had demolished over 200 Eastern Orthodox churches including many that were significant heritage monuments to Russia's history. He was initiator of the July 1954 CPSU Central Committee resolution hostile to religion. He was not able to implement his ideas in practice until he achieved greater consolidation of his control in the late 1950s.\n\nThe anti-religious campaign of the Khrushchev era began in 1959, coinciding with the twenty first Party Congress in the same year. It was carried out by mass closures of churches (reducing the number from 22,000 in 1959 to 13,008 in 1960 and to 7,873 by 1965), monasteries, and convents, as well as of the still-existing seminaries (pastoral courses would be banned in general). The campaign also included a restriction of parental rights for teaching religion to their children, a ban on the presence of children at church services (beginning in 1961 with the Baptists and then extended to the Orthodox in 1963), and a ban on administration of the Eucharist to children over the age of four. Khrushchev additionally banned all services held outside of church walls, renewed enforcement of the 1929 legislation banning pilgrimages, and recorded the personal identities of all adults requesting church baptisms, weddings or funerals. He also disallowed the ringing of church bells and services in daytime in some rural settings from May to the end of October under the pretext of field work requirements. Non-fulfillment of these regulations by clergy would lead to disallowance of state registration for them (which meant they could no longer do any pastoral work or liturgy at all, without special state permission). The state carried out forced retirement, arrests and prison sentences to clergymen who criticized atheism or the anti-religious campaign, who conducted Christian charity or who made religion popular by personal example.\n\nKhrushchev claimed that communist education intends to free consciousness from religious prejudices and superstitions.\n\nOne of the first manifestations of the campaign, like as occurred in the 1920s, was the removal of practicing believers from the teaching profession. In 1959, reports appeared 'unmasking' secret believers in faculties of education. In one case a Christian student was asked how she would teach in an atheistic school system, and she replied \"I'll give all answers in accordance with Marxism. What are my personal convictions is no one's business.\" The same article also took concern that atheist students felt that they could not win in a discussion with believers.\n\nThe press called for more aggressively atheistic curriculum at pedagogical institutions.\n\nIn 1959 a mandatory course was introduced called 'The Foundations of Scientific Atheism' in all higher learning institutions. Evolution and the origins of life began to be taught intensively in the school system beginning in 1959-1960, and all natural sciences were subordinated to the purpose of giving students a scientific-materialistic (i.e. atheistic) attitude towards nature.\n\nBelievers could be denied graduation at institutions of higher learning on account of their religion.\n\nThe school system was criticized in a 1960 open letter to the Russian Minister of Education for failing to perform its duty to eliminate religious belief among its students. The letter claimed that believing parents were fanatics and that active believers as well as clergy were swindlers. The minister responded by outlining what the education system had been doing and reaffirming that he regarded religious belief as a very serious social epidemic.\n\nThe atheist position was not simply concerned with trying to teach a worldview without religion, but a worldview that was hostile to religion: \n\nThe 21st Congress brought in a new, radical program of anti-religious propaganda that would stay in place for the next twenty-five years.\n\nA new anti-religious periodical appeared in 1959 called Science and Religion (Nauka i Religiia), which followed in the tradition of Bezbozhnik in aggressiveness and vulgarness, but was much less vicious.\n\nDue to the memory among many citizens of the patriotic role that the Church had played in war with Germany, the loyalty it had shown during the war and the supportiveness of the institution in post-war peace campaigns, and the failure of the regime to rewrite history in order to remove these memories, the antireligious propaganda therefore avoided attacking the Church leadership or its institutional political reliability.\n\nThe church leadership also cooperated with the state's propaganda campaign by denying any persecution by the state at international peace and theological conferences, as well as to foreign press. The upper orthodox church hierarchy during these years largely remained unscathed by the persecution directed at the rest of the church, which the hierarchy refused to speak out about and which even made statements to justify.\n\nThe propaganda, unlike in the 1930s, made no promises about liquidating the church in the near future or that the word 'God' would disappear from Russian vocabulary. There was also less artistic talent in printed antireligious cartoons and posters as there had been in the pre-war years. 'Science and Religion' even found itself having to rely on foreign atheist artists to draw their anti-religious cartoons, such as the French communist cartoonist Maurice Henry.\n\nThe propaganda, like in the 1930s, lost its originality after its enhancement in 1958 as anti-religious periodicals adopted lifeless routines in their propaganda. Every newspaper was supposed to have a plan governing their anti-religious content, but few adhered to this systematically. A number had regular columns dedicated to religion and atheism which had names such as 'The Atheist Corner' or 'The Militant Atheist'. Very often they simply reprinted articles that had been originally printed by Pravda, TASS and other newspapers.\n\nAs in the pre-war period, lies and incitements against religion were considered permissible only if they pragmatically served the purpose of eliminating rather than hardening religious convictions.\n\nVery often official policies to criticize religion without insulting believers' feelings were ignored in practice, and this widespread violation caused some to even doubt the authenticity of the policy. These attacks became even more unrestrained as a result of influence from the CPSU Central Committee.\n\nExamples of article names that appeared in this time period are: 'The Howls of the Obscurantists', 'The Vultures', 'The Wolfish Fangs of \"God's Harmless Creatures\"', 'Swindlers in the guise of Holy Fathers', 'A Theologian-Fomenter, and 'Hysteria on the March'. Believers were called 'toadstools', 'swindlers', 'a horde', 'anti-Soviet subhumans' (liudishki), 'wicked enemy of all that lives', and 'the rot'. Secret monks were called 'milksops', theologians of the True Orthodox Church were called 'malignant', and Levitin-Krasnov who spoke out against the persecution was called 'Smerdiakov' (the despicable bastard in The Brothers Karamazov) and a hypocrite par excellence.\n\nOne of the most commonly repeated antireligious arguments of this period was that the cosmonauts had not seen God when they went into space. Khrushchev claimed that Yuri Gagarin said that he did not see God when he went into orbit (although later evidence suggests that Gagarin himself was religious) and soviet leaders saw the space programme as a tool with which to attack religion.\n\nThe press always accused believers of immorality, and blamed this supposed immorality on their religious beliefs. Practicing believers were libelled as lechers, demoralized weaklings, drunks, vicious criminals and parasites who did no socially useful work, just as in the pre-war period. Similarly also to the pre-war period, accusations and hate propaganda in the press often preceded arrests of clergy.\n\nThe testimony of ex-priests who denounced their former fellow clergymen for lechery, luxury, pilfering and materialistic greed, were used when available. These 'confessions' often ended with appeals to still practicing clergy to stop fooling credulous believers and to stop enriching themselves by exploiting their ignorance'.\n\nSome, such as former professor of theology, Alexander Osipov, warned that this image was oversimplified and that religion did in fact attract intellectuals sometimes. He claimed that the church was not a senile institution ready to fall, but had great flexibility and adaptability. He also notably criticized the atheistic propaganda for being bureaucratic routine and that atheist propagandists were often ignorant of religion (e.g. confusing Jehovah's Witnesses with Old Believers, general ignorance of Christian doctrines). Osipov also said that 'Science and Religion' should focus on educational material since the journal was largely unread by lay believers, but that such attacks should rather occur in the general mass media.\n\nThis claim may have been incorrect, however. Believers did subscribe to 'Science and Religion' in order to make clippings of all the quotations from Scriptures, diverse theological writings or lives of the saints, that were reprinted in the journal and criticized, as this was one of the few sources available that believers could find such material within.\n\nTolerant attitudes of children to believing parents or grandparents were criticized.\n\nPilgrims and pilgrimages were maligned in the press for charlatanism, clerical swindles to extract donations, and distraction of people from socially useful work. One of the most vicious examples of these was written by a woman named Trubnikova entitled 'Hysteria on the March' that described a pilgrimage to a spring in the village of in the diocese of Kirov, where there was supposedly an apparition of St. Nicholas centuries earlier. Trubnikova claimed that she disguised herself as a pilgrim and went with them. She claimed that they were alcoholics, hysterics, hypocrites and swindlers who faked trances and miracles (there were people who dipped themselves into the spring and then shed their crutches, which she assumed was a deceitful act). The story ended with robberies, sexual orgies and a drunken murder. Trubnikova claimed that she was rescued by a voluntary police aide in the middle of the night who claimed that these anti-Soviet sub-human Christians would have no hesitation in murdering her. She ended the article by appealing for a ban on all such pilgrimages, which were taking place right before the eyes of the Soviet public.\n\nThe rites of all religious faiths were claimed to be linked with spreading diseases. Jewish and Muslim circumcision was claimed to cause gangrene, leading to fatalities. The Orthodox tradition of mass kissing of icons, crucifixes and relics was treated with long discourses on how this spread infectious diseases. Communion using a shared chalice was also given such treatment. The same was true with regard to the sacrament of baptism. Full immersion baptism was alleged to lead to colds, influenzas and pneumonias, especially in infants and especially in the winter months, which sometimes led to fatalities. The overcrowding of churches was also alleged to result in spreading infectious diseases (never, however, did the propaganda also admit in the same context that the mass Soviet closure of churches or other institutions had resulted in the overcrowding).\n\nThe anti-religious propaganda was largely unconcerned with objectivity and truth, but rather to build up a negative image of believers as fanatics, disseminators of disease, social pests or criminals, in order to justify the persecution to the public.\n\nThe Marxist doctrine that religion would inevitably disappear was increasingly questioned and re-interpreted. A new interpretation held that religion was forced down upon people somehow through coercive tactics of believers. For example, in a supposedly true story printed in the press on the True Orthodox Christian Wanderers (an outlawed Old Believer sect) a monastic priest with a bony predatory nose, who was hiding from the law, wandered through the woods and came upon a group of sectarians who agree to hide him while assuring him that he could have a life without working. They then produce samizdat literature that breathes hatred against everything human and to the Soviet Union especially. A college student from the city of Novokuznetsk then met this priest and had a conversation with him, in which the student expressed some thoughts that maybe there was something beyond this world. The priest then seized the opportunity and talked him into coming to a skete in Siberia. On the way, in the middle of the night, the priest grabbed the frightened student and forcibly baptized him. Then he ordered him to destroy his papers and passport, but not his money, which the priest took for himself. The article then concluded that all religious believers, who were reportedly properly characterized in this fashion, are malicious enemies of all living things.\n\nThis story in the press was followed with mass arrests of believers who were supposedly running a kidnapping network as well as these supposed secret Siberian sketes and underground theological schools. Their victims were 'rescued' and brought back into the secular world, and their conversion was explained as a result of their own foolishness that was taken advantage of by the manipulative clergy.\n\nThe Soviet press on occasion criticized the campaign for senseless destruction of the built heritage of the country, such as the dynamiting of the Ufa Cathedral in 1956. However, rarely did the brutality of the persecutions themselves find criticism in this time period. To the contrary, in the publication 'Soviet Ethnography' produced by the Soviet Academy of Sciences, for example, it wrote in one article: 'The Party has never reconciled itself and never will, with ideological reaction of any kind… The struggle against religion must not only be continued, but it ought to be enhanced by all possible means'.\n\nThe 'rightist' view that religion would disappear on its own and no efforts were needed re-appeared in these years, and was criticized in the official press.\n\nThere were some admissions of the growth of interest in youth in religion during these years in the official press.\n\nTwo special 'universities of atheism' began in Leningrad and several more in its province. One of these universities was run by Znanie and other by the Leningrad Museum of History of Religion and Atheism. These universities trained lecturers, propagadanists and other agitators for 'individual work'.\n\nClubs of atheism were formed for average people at local 'Palaces of Culture', followed by special atheist film clubs.\n\nMany conferences were held in this period on anti-religious propaganda and the issue of how to best combat religion.\n\nMany unofficial and semi-official reports were available in the West about what was occurring with regard to brutalities and terror, but these were largely ignored for lack of being authoritative. When reports of anti-religious persecution reached the West, the state referred to them as 'malicious slander'.\n\nAmong the reasons for why the campaign drew little attention were i) the regime did not attack the clerical leadership specially, as had occurred in the 1920s or 1930s ii) the clerical leadership repeatedly denied the presence of persecution or suppression of religion to international conferences as well as to foreign media iii) the campaign was not as vicious as had occurred under Lenin or Stalin, and iv) masses of people had not been mobilized for this campaign as they had been in the 1930s. Khrushchev's campaign, while being the most brutal episode of persecution after Stalin's death in Soviet history, largely went unnoticed in the Western world, partly as a result of poor coverage in the Western media, which often instead attempted to portray Khrushchev as a more liberal figure, and partly also as a result of a lack of resemblance between this campaign and the campaigns under Lenin or Stalin.\n\nKhrushchev and his regime fostered a false image of himself as being tolerant towards religion to foreigners. In an interview with American journalists in 1957 he stated:\n\nWe still have people who believe in God. Let them believe. To believe or not to believe in God is the personal affair of each individual, a matter for his conscience. All this does not, however, prevent the Soviet people from living in peace and friendship. And it often happens that there are believers and atheists in one family. But those who believe in God are becoming fewer. The vast majority of young people growing up today do not believe in God. Education, scientific knowledge, and the study of the laws of nature leave no room for belief in God.\n\nForeigners who travelled to the USSR had their visits tightly controlled so that they did not see anything that would have led to bad press for the regime.\n\nMuch of the 'Old Guard' of the anti-religious work pre-World War II had died or they were no longer in condition to help with the new campaign.\n\nThe Central Committee issued anti-religious measures with carefully worded euphemisms. In 1958 Khrushchev published his Theses on Educational Reform that called for the development of a materialistic (i.e. atheism) world-view in youth.\n\nThe Soviet Council of Ministers issued an instruction on 16 October 1958 that cancelled the tax exemptions on monasteries and which also instructed local governments to cut the sizes of land plots being owned by monasteries and to work towards closing open monasteries. The tax rates on Monasteries were raised to 4000 roubles per hectare (400 roubles after the 1961 devaluation). Another instruction issued on 6 November of that year introduced a very high tax on monasteries. Monasteries had for years served an important spiritual function in the Orthodox church as centres of pilgrimage, confessions, spiritual consoluations and for strengthening lay people in their faith; thus, shutting them down was meant to weaken the spiritual life of the church. Monasteries also had an ambiguous status under Soviet law, which made these measures easier to pass.\n\nThere were rumours, never refuted, that the 21st congress of the CPSU in 1959 had adopted a secret resolution for the annihilation of all religious institutions in the country during the implementation of the seven-year plan. That conference declared that the communist society was inseparable from an atheistic upbringing of its members. The new persecution that emerged was partly justified on the success that religion had achieved in the post-war era.\n\nThe January 9th 1960 Central Committee Plenum Resolution 'On the Tasks of Party Propaganda in Modern Times' called for an escalation of anti-religious persecution and criticized party organizations that were being too lax. It did not include any measures calling for moderation or avoiding insults to believers, but it reiterated the pre-war view that religion was hostile to communism. It called for the introduction, beginning in 1961-62 of special courses of basic political education in senior high school grades (which included atheistic instruction). This set off a large volume of anti-religious articles in Soviet periodicals, which for several years had been producing very few anti-religious pieces.\n\nThe CC plenum resolution brought back 'individual work' among believers, which was a concept used in the 1930s. This was a practice of atheist tutors (appointed by different public institutions including the CP, Komsomol, Znanie and trade unions) visiting known religious believers at their homes to try to convince them to become atheists. In most cases the tutors were workmates of the believers. If the believer was not convinced, the tutor would bring it to the attention of their union or professional collectives, and the backwardness and obstinacy of the specific believers were presented in public meetings before the believer's colleagues. If this did not work, administrative harassment would follow at work or school, and the believers would often be subject to lower-paid jobs, blocking of promotion, or expulsion from college if the believer was in college. Teachers commonly physically punished believing schoolchildren.\n\nSpecial schools had been set up in Leningrad in 1958 for the purpose of training tutors for 'individual work', which implies that the resurrection of this practice had been planned for years.\n\nIn 1961 a decree was passed that reconfirmed the ban on group pilgrimages. This was followed by campaigns of character assassination in the media against pilgrims and monasteries. This measure forbade believers from visiting monuments or graves of persons they considered to be saints. Boris Talantov reported such a ban coming even earlier in Kirov diocese in 1960. Reforms were introduced in 1961 to exert tight control over church operations.\n\nThe 22nd CPSU congress in 1961 re-affirmed the need to eliminate religion in order to build true communism and the need for true anti-religious education. The congress proclaimed that the current generation would come to live under true communism, which was interpreted to mean that religion needed to be vanquished within that timeframe. The 1962 14th Komsomol congress called for a more concrete attack on religion and that it was the duty of every Komsomol member to resolutely struggle against religion. This congress also declared that freedom of consicence did not apply to children and that parents should not cripple children spiritually. On a similar note, the top Soviet legal journal declared that parental rights over children was a right given by the society and which could be withdrawn by the state if this right was abused.\n\nThe CPSU Central Committee issued two resolutions on July 6, 1962, directed at the leadership in Belarus and Kuibyshev Oblast that called for an end to the dissemination of religious ideas, especially among the young, and it criticized the party leadership for failing in the anti-religious struggle. It allowed for direct persecution of believers. This was re-printed in the press and followed by the whole country (as was the usual paradigm when a resolution was directed at a specific region).\n\nIn June 1963, Leonid Il'ichev made a speech at the ideological plenum of the Central Committee. In it he called people who persisted in religious beliefs as amoral, and that religion was one of the extreme forms of bourgeois ideology. He advised a merciless war against religion, claimed that if they did nothing the Church would grow and that they needed a militantly aggressive assault on religion. He criticized Stalin for not holding true to Lenin's legacy in his tolerant policies towards religion after 1941 (Khrushchev also criticized Stalin's attempt to turn the site of the former Cathedral of Christ the Saviour in Moscow into a great Soviet monument, which Khrushchev decided instead would be a swimming pool). Il'ichev, claimed that believers were 'political rascal and opportunists…[who] cheat, dissemble, hiding their hostility towards our political system under a mask of religion'.\n\nThe two state organizations for overseeing religion in the country (one for the Orthodox, the other for everyone else), changed their functions between 1957-1964. Originally Stalin had created them in 1943 as liaison bodies between religious communities and the state; however, in the Khrushchev years their function was re-interpreted as dictatorial supervisors over the religious activities in the country. This control was not officially legislated, but it was created by secret instructions.\n\nPrior to this campaign, the famous St. Basil's Cathedral in Moscow had been turned into a museum. In 1958, only 38 Orthodox churches were open in Moscow.\n\nPatriarch Alexii made a speech in the Kremlin at a Soviet peace conference in 1960 in which he openly admitted persecutions, praised the role of the Church in Russia's history especially in times of crisis, and warned the Soviet government that the gates of hell shall not prevail against the Church. This was the high point of the church hierarchy's resistance to the campaign, and it resulted in the forced retirement of the speech writer (Bishop Nikolai) and his mysterious death a few months later, as well as the Patriarchate's later submission to the new pressures. The hierarchy in Russia was often criticized in Samizdat documents by people suffering persecution for its cooperation with the authorities.\n\nThe Orthodox hierarchy found itself in alliance with the state on different issues including the establishment of world peace, the abolition of race and class differences, condemning US aggression in Vietnam, and the abolition of the exploitation of the colonial system. At international conferences such as relations with other Orthodox communities outside of Russia, at the World Council of Churches, and the Prague Peace conference, the Orthodox hierarchy emphasized the religious tolerance and humanitarianism of the Soviet Union. After Khrushchev the hierarchy would also lend its support to the state on the invasion of Czechoslovakia and denunciation of the right-wing military government in Greece.\n\nIn 1961 the government explicitly forbade clergy from applying any kind of disciplinary measures to those under their care. The Orthodox church was forced to let go of many of its regulations in conflict with the Leninist legality. Parish priests became legally the employees of the 'twenty persons' (after the church was deprived of its status of legal person, different parishes were considered to be owned by groups of at least twenty laypersons who applied) who were registered as the owners of the parish, and the priest was deprived of any administrative controls over the parish. These 'twenties' also found themselves being increasingly penetrated by soviet agents who thereby hijacked control of different parishes. There was a campaign in the early 1960s to acquire more defections of priests and theologians to atheism, but the defections produced little result among the communities and the campaign was abandoned.\n\nVery few Orthodox clergy ever became atheists in the whole history of the state.\n\nAs a result of official harassment as well as practical difficulties, many believers had religious funeral rites performed 'by correspondence' wherein believers would mail some earth from deceased person's grave to a priest, and the priest would then bless the earth and return it to the believers in some fashion. In 1963 these types of funerals fell roughly between a range of 45-90% in different parts of the country in their portion of the total funeral rites.\n\nCROCA (Council for Russian Orthodox Church Affairs) relentlessly and arbitrarily appointed and removed priests through abuse of its registration and de-registration function. This led to the removal of the most popular and spiritually most influential priests from parishes, and it usually involved refusing to register any priests that were selected by popular choice of the congregation. Bishops were cowed and cooperated with CROCA, by instructing the priests under them to fulfill all of the government's instructions. Priests thereby ceased or reduced making topical or uplifting sermons as well as sermons that criticized atheism and the state ideology, but instead found themselves often simply making abstract sermons on Christian ethics. Under state pressure priests even found themselves coerced into making sermons against the presence of beggars on church steps (since the 1929 legislation had made Christian charitable efforts to be illegal).\n\nAfter 1960, CROCA began to forbid churches to provide temporary housing to people who came long distances to services. In compliance, church councils expelled such people. Some churches that secretly continued to do this were often visited by militia who would expel such people forcibly (even including elderly people on cold days in the winter). This measure effectively made it impossible for people from afar to attend services any longer, which further reduced church attendance (and thereby contributed to the propaganda that people were losing interest in religion). It also helped reduce income that parishes received. The lack of funds and attendance could be further used as excuses to close more parishes.\n\nIn Kirov diocese after the end of 1959, priests began to receive oral orders from plenipotentiaries that forbade them to administer confessions, communion, baptisms, extreme unctions and other private religious services at private homes, even to the terminally ill, without explicit permission to do so for each case from the local soviet. It is known that a similar unpublished measure two years later was given to Moscow priests who were forced to sign it. This measure when implemented could be used by the antireligious propaganda who could then claim that priests were lazy selfish people who would let a sick person die without coming to him; the fact that these instructions were unpublished meant that no priest was able to prove them to be true in the face of such criticism. The authorities in Moscow denied that such a measure existed, which could further be used to allege that the priests were liars trying to slander the Soviet government.\n\nAt the third Znanie congress, it was reported that there were 15 inter-republican and republican as well as 150 provincial, conferences and seminars for promoting atheism in the year 1959, with the total participation of 14,000 propagandists. At one conference organized at the Soviet Academy of Sciences, up to 800 scholars and atheist propagandists participated. The congress also criticized the lack of education among many atheist propagandists, and cited an example of a cartoon in Nauka i religii ('Science and Religion') of Seventh-day Adventists praying before a religious icon as well as another example of an article in the same paper that referred to the Talmud as a Hebrew prayer book that believers held in their hands during Synagogue services. It also called for publication of a basic textbook on scientific atheism, which soon appeared and by 1964 had a circulation of 50,000 copies.\n\nIn January 1960, a high level Znanie conference on atheism, encouraged attacks on the church and returning to Lenin's legacy that had been discarded in World War II.\n\nPentecostals were accused of causing serious mental and physical stress in their members by their practice of severe fasting and states of ecstasy as well as trances during their services. Their clergy were tried and sentenced to hard labour periodically. For example, Pentecostal presbyter, Kondrakov, in the Donets Basin mining area was accused of causing reactive psychosis in his parishioners and was sentenced to eight years of imprisonment.\n\nIt was made illegal in 1960 for children and youth to attend services in the Baptist church. Similar measures to other denominations followed later. This may have been a result of the Baptists success in attracting much Soviet youth to their religion. The Baptists cooperated with the state and the central leadership of their community called on its membership to try to reduce the baptism of young people between the ages of 18-30, and forbade children from attending services. This type of interference, by the state in this instance, was technically illegal under Soviet law. This cooperation between the baptist leadership and the state led to a massive split in the Baptist community, when in 1962 the Initiative Baptists (Initsiativkniki) illegally formed as a community. The state engaged in massive persecutions against this new group and tried to treat the official Baptist church with many rights and privileges in contrast.\n\nThe experience with the Baptist community prompted the state to be more cautious when it attempted similar measures against the Orthodox Church by banning priests from conducting services in the presence of children or youths. This instruction was never published but was usually given orally by local plenipotentiaries and involved threats of deregistration if it was not carried out.\n\nIn Kirov diocese these measures came into place in the summer of 1963, and the first attempts to implement the measure failed when mothers bringing their children to church physically assaulted the policemen and Komsomol who had gathered in order to stop them, who were overpowered. After this occurred CROCA plenipotentiaries phoned priests by telephone and ordered them not to give the sacraments to children or youths, and the priests largely complied.\n\nThese measures were not applied uniformly, and numerous priests in the country continued to administer the Eucharist to children and even conduct special Te Deums for schoolchildren on the eve of the first school day in September. The authorities had much difficulty implementing these measures, due to resistance from the Patriarch who otherwise cooperated with them on most other subjects, as well as the resistance of parents. The state attempted other means to implement this.\n\nIn Georgia, where there had been 2455 churches before 1917, only a hundred remained by 1962 (with 11 in Tbilisi).\n\nMany priests were imprisoned as a result of attracting youths to their services. In Orenburg diocese, for example, 46 priests were imprisoned in 1960. Clergy were harassed for working with youths down to the fall of the regime. Seminary candidates who left employment in order to go to seminary were arrested, and priests who helped them were deprived of registration.\n\nParents of children who openly demonstrated their faith at school or of children who did not join the Pioneers or wear their kerchiefs for religious reasons were prosecuted by the courts. These court cases resulted in the deprival of parental rights and their children were sent to boarding schools. Parents who tried to raise their children in their faith could be also prosecuted and have their children removed from them.\n\nSeminaries began to be closed down in 1960. This was often done under the official pretext that they were not being used, while at the same time the Soviet authorities took measures to prevent students from coming (e.g. at the Volhynia seminary, the state ordered the institution to provide a list of names of their candidates, and afterwards it then registered the students for mandatory military service or refused their residence permits in Lutsk, which allowed them to shut down the institution in 1964 under the pretext that it was not being used). The Soviet media reported that this was a natural decline of those willing to enroll and it was a sign of the decline of religious beliefs. Five of the eight seminaries in the country were shut down during this period, and in the surviving seminaries (Moscow, Leningrad and Odessa) student numbers were reduced. At the surviving Leningrad seminary, for example, the population of the seminary was reduced to 70 (from 396 in 1953). The lack of seminary candidates, therefore also meant a lack of priests being produced which therefore meant that more parishes could be shut down for lack of use.\n\nDespite being deprived of their funds, the monasteries were able to hold on to their existence, until they were closed in later years directly following a massive anti-monastic campaign in the press, which depicted the funds-deprived monasteries as parasitic institutions with fields and gardens tilled by exploited peasants while the consecrated religious enjoyed themselves. The monasteries were accused of black-market dealings, sexual relations of the monks with nuns and female pilgrims, and drunkenness. The administrators of the communities were also accused of collaboration with the Nazis. The actual shutting down of the monasteries was presented in the press as being voluntarily done by the consecrated religious who were happy to join the working world. The Old Believer sect of True Orthodox Wanderers was also attacked for supposed harbouring of criminals and deserters from the war. Monasteries had traditionally been the greatest centres of pilgrimage in Orthodoxy, which may have prompted the government's great interest in eliminating them. Their number was reduced from 69 in 1959 to 17 by 1965 (there were over 1000 before 1917).\n\nIn March 1961, the Soviet Council of Ministers forbade parishes to engage in any form of charity or offering financial aid to other parishes or monasteries. Further methods were used to limit funds for churches, including banning sales of candles according to 1929 legislation that forbade obligatory payments to religious organizations. This allowed for even more churches to be closed. The depopulation of rural areas in Siberia, the Urals and Northern Russia as the people moved to the cities was used as a pretext to close their churches (new churches were not simultaneously opened in the cities though).\n\nAfter the Soviet government reconfirmed its ban on group pilgrimages in 1961, it then began a campaign to destroy grave-sites and monuments of people who were considered to be saints. Some of these sites included nationally revered sites that attracted thousands of pilgrims since as early as the 14th and 15th centuries.\n\nIn 1962, 'Administrative Commissions Attached to the Executive Committees of the City Soviets of Workers Deputies' were set up as disciplinarian supervisors over religious bodies. They were made up of state employees and members of local \"Soviets\", and they kept religious societies under observation. They studied ways to weaken and limit the activities of religious groups, and to expose any attempts by clergy to violate soviet law. At the same time, local \"Soviet\" executives were charged with making sure that the 'groups of twenty' that held legal rights over churches were filled with reliable people who would not care for the spiritual life of the parish. Since the priests had been made the employees of these groups, this legislation allowed for the state to take control of parishes. This situation often bred discontent in parishes, and led to confrontation between the executive group of twenty and the priest.\n\nAccording to reports from Boris Talantov in Kirov diocese, the campaign was primarily directed at liquidating churches and religious associations, and that it was being fulfilled by CROCA (later CRA) and its local plenipotentiaries with support from local governments. He said that usually the provincial CROCA plenipotentiary would de-register the priest serving a church earmarked for liquidation or move the priest to another parish. Then for six to eleven months he would permit no new priest to occupy the vacant post while ignoring the petitions by parishioners. This happened to 21 out of the 80 priests in Kirov diocese between 1960-1963. While the church continued to be vacant, the local government would then attempt to intimidate the believers to quit the religious association ('the twenty') that registered the church, after which the it was declared that the religious association no longer existed. Then the Provincial Executivee Committee would declare the church closed and hand over the building to the local collective farm or town soviet for other uses, often without informing the religious association, which would then be officially de-registered. He claimed that many reports and delegations were sent to CROCA in Moscow that gave evidence that the religious association still existed or that the collective farm in question did not require the church building for any purposes. Never would the text of de-registration decisions be shown to believers (which Soviet law in fact required), and the liquidations themselves often took place with the protection of militia and in the middle of the night. Believers would not be permitted to enter the churches and the contents were confiscated without any inventory.\n\nIn his description icons were broken up and burned, service books and scriptures were destroyed, and the Communion wine was consumed by the militia. The church building would sometimes be wrecked or burned (in the case of wooden structures), including the famous 18th-century church of Zosima and Savvatii in the village of Korshik. That church had been protected by the state, which had promised it would be protected as cultural heritage, but in 1963 it was destroyed and transformed into a collective farm club. Talantov reported that it would have cost less simply to build a new club.\n\nTalantov recorded a story about a popular priest TG Perestoronin, who was arbitrarily deprived of his registration in 1961 which was followed by the arbitrary closure of his church soon after. He moved to Kirov to work as a reader in the local church, while leaving his family in the closed church back home. The local village boss decided to evict his family in the middle of winter in 1962, with legal court backing. The local schoolmistress hired the priest's wife as a charwoman to save her prosecution for parasitism, but the local boss then fired the schoolmistress from her post. Perestoronin, having heard this, was forced to leave his post in Kirov and take up a job as a plumber, which the authorities rewarded by ending the harassment against his family and they were allowed to go back to their old house.\n\nIn 1960, a beautiful 18th century Transfiguration Chapel near Kirov built on a site with a pool of water that traditionally was held to have miraculous powers, was closed. A year later it was demolished. Pilgrims continued to go to the site afterwards, but the authorities reacted by filling the pool and blocking the spring. The local bishop gave his support to the Soviet authorities to accomplish this, and on May 20, 1964 he forbade pilgrimages in his diocese. In 1966 believers in Kirov even requested from the Moscow Patriarchate to remove him, but they were given a negative answer with the reason that the Soviet government insisted he remain in place and the Patriarch had to cooperate.\n\nTalantov reported that the number of functioning Orthodox churches in Kirov diocese were reduced from 75 in 1959 to 35 by 1964 through these methods (before 1917 there were over 500 churches in the diocese). Many protests and pleas to the authorities followed these events, but were ignored, and the believers who made them were subject to intimidation, shouts, insults, beatings, and other methods that resulted in some physical injuries, several deaths and nervous breakdowns.\n\nThe campaign that Talantov reported for Kirov diocese is one of the best recorded local campaigns, and other campaigns around the country may have followed similar patterns. The antireligious press presented these liquidations as being done at the request of the local population. For example, in a church in Yastrebino, the official press reported:\n\nThe Moscow Patriarchate continued to cooperate with the state by declaring that almost all such churches were closed as a result of a decline in religious belief and were mostly just amalgamations with other churches. Talantov described some such 'amalgamations' in Kirov diocese of churches that were 40 kilometres apart. Some parts of the Soviet establishment admitted to the massive closures being done against believers' wills and criticized the arbitrariness of the closures for promoting dissatisfaction and bitterness among believers as well as giving ammunition to foreign critics of the Soviet Union.\n\nIn the entire region of Sakha-Yakutia (about half the size of the continental United States) there was only one functioning church left open after Khrushchev until the fall of communism, which meant that many believers needed to travel up to 2000 kilometres in order to get the nearest church.\n\nA Soviet law that had invalidated all legislation passed under the Nazi occupation was used in order to justify the closures of churches that had been re-opened during the war; this constituted most of the re-opened churches, while churches in other parts of the country were closed with other legal justification (such as the law that forced employers to make sure that their employees had a residence in their area, which was used to make missionary priests illegal). Sometimes churches were closed as a result of the priest shortage produced by the closure of seminaries, wherein a priest would not be found for a church for six months and the authorities would then permanently close the church on grounds of its lack of use. Sometimes they were closed by refusing to give permits for the church to make repairs, and then closing the buildings on grounds of safety once they deteriorated.\n\nNone of these churches opened during the war were actually opened by the Germans, however. In Odessa diocese 210 religious congregations of various denominations were shut down by this method. The total number of Orthodox churches in Belarus was similarly reduced by the same method from 1200 to less than 400. The Dnepropetrovsk diocese was reduced from 180 to 40 in the same way and the diocese of the Crimea was reduced to 15 churches.\n\nThis law could not be applied to areas that had been captured by the USSR during the war period, wherein the churches had been open before the war began (e.g. The Baltic republics, or eastern Poland). However, these areas were also treated with mass closure of churches. Only 75 Roman Catholic churches remained open in Latvia in 1964 from an original 500 and 180 parishes were liquidated in Volhynia.\n\nMany churches could be legally closed simply for being in proximity to a school and thereby endangering children with exposure to religious propaganda. This in effect meant that masses of churches could be closed, since many schools were in existence before the revolution and had been run by the Orthodox Church which commonly built them side by side with the local church building. This particular pretext may have continued to be used after Khrushchev left office.\n\nIn the north Russian autonomous republic of Komi where there had been 150 churches before 1917, there were only 3 remaining by 1964, but they were accompanied by 20 underground parishes as well as a few 'catacomb' communities of the True Orthodox.\n\nThe number of functioning orthodox churches was reduced from over 20,000 prior to 1960 to 6850 by 1972, and a similar decrease in the same period of Orthodox priests from 30,000 to 6180. The Soviet media claimed that this was a natural decline in religion, but contradictorily reported at other times that only 200 priests had resigned in the same period.\n\nThe growing number of interfaith marriages in the traditionally Muslim regions of Central Asia may have reflected a breaking-down of traditional Islamic customs and culture. A total of 3567 mosques were closed under Khrushchev in Uzbekistan alone.\n\nBoris Talantov, a mathematics teacher in Kirov diocese in the north-eastern part of European Russia was one of the first voices to sound the alarm of the mass closures of churches. He sent reports to Soviet newspapers and the central government in Moscow, all of which ignored them, and then he resorted to secret illegal literature sent to the West, for which he was caught and imprisoned. Talantov lost his job as a teacher, and he died in 1971 in prison.\n\nA layperson named Levitin-Krasnov spoke out against the persecution during its height in samizdat tracts. He lost his job as a high-school teacher in 1959. He had been imprisoned from 1949–1956 and he was imprisoned again from 1969-1972. He had taken monastic vows in secret, but lived 'in the world'. He was painted as a hypocrite by the press for teaching Russian literature at school while publishing theological articles under a pseudonym that the press claimed were 'full of spite and arrogance'. He was made out to be a scion of a wealthy Russian aristocratic family and was bitter over the loss of its estate. In actuality, Levitin-Krasnov was a Christian Marxist; he was also an opponent of some Russian nationalists who wanted to turn the USSR into a Christian theocracy. He was expelled in 1974 and he went to Switzerland.\n\nArchbishop Iov of Kazan was arrested in 1960 after libellous articles written against him in the press. He had lived under the German occupation and was accused of anti-Soviet activities. He was accused of lechery and misappropriating church funds. It was alleged he was hated by his parishioners for a luxurious lifestyle. The press calculated his salary, but failed to mention the upwards of 81% tax rate on clerical salaries. His case was very similar to Archbishop Andrei of Chernigov. He resisted the closure of churches and he was sentenced to three years' hard labour for tax evasion. After Iov was released he became archbishop of Ufa (by this fact the charges were likely false, because if he had really been evading taxes neither the church nor the state would have allowed this).\n\nArchbishop Andrei of Cernigov had been arrested under Stalin after he completed his theological studies. He had lived under the German occupation and was accused of anti-Soviet activities, with his arrest under Stalin used as evidence to support this allegation. He was accused of lechery and misappropriating church funds. It was alleged he was hated by his parishioners for a luxurious lifestyle. The press calculated his salary, but failed to mention the upwards of 81% tax rate on clerical salaries. He resisted the closure of a monastery in his diocese and he was arrested in 1961 after libellous articles written against him in the press, and sentenced to eight years' hard labour. Both the Chernigov monastery and the Chernigov cathedral were shut down shortly after his arrest. He was reappointed diocesan bishop after his release, but found that he had to retire to a monastery because his mental health had been wrecked from his experience in the camp.\n\nBishop Ermogen of Tashkent was forced into retirement after he tried to resist the closure of churches. After his arrest, the authorities closed down many churches in his diocese.\n\nThe very popular Archbishop Veniamin (Novitsky) of Irkutsk underwent a campaign of character assassination in the Soviet press in connection with a church warden who had accidentally killed a juvenile thief. Veniamin was too popular for the Soviet establishment to tolerate, and so he was removed to the diocese of Chuvashia.\n\nArchbishop Venedikt was arrested and died in prison in 1963 in connection with resisting the closure of churches.\n\nFeodosia Varavva was a doctor's aide who had volunteered for military service in the war and worked in front-line hospitals. She was a believer and after the war she was forced to work as a junior nurse in the most infectious sections of hospitals. Her family was given poor living quarters and she petitioned for a better apartment. One of her neighbour's reported that she was a religious believer with icons in her apartment and that she took her children to church. After this report, her husband was told to divorce her and take the children, and then they would be given better housing; he refused to comply. Mrs. Varavva was told to give up her faith if she wanted a better apartment, and she refused. In 1959 the school headmaster saw her children going to church, and he then contacted her and told her to let her son join the Pioneers. She refused on the grounds that it was an antireligious organization. She finally found an apartment in Lvov (she came from Minsk), but the school teachers had reported her and she was being investigated. Her case was notable because when the Soviets began to expel children from church services, Varavva petitioned all the way to the chief CROCA plenipotentiary in Belarus to whom she argued that she had a constitutional right to educate her children as Christians. The chief plenipotentiary then personally phoned the Minsk cathedral and instructed them to give the sacraments to Varavva's children in the sanctuary so that others would not see it. Varavva was not satisfied with this, however, but she fought on principle for other children to be able to take the Sacraments as well. This caused her to be noticed in the Soviet press where she underwent character assassination. She was presented as an intolerant, aggressive woman who was bullying the school and teachers, and that her son was an atheist being forced by his mother to go to church. The Soviet press also reported on parent-teacher meetings in which they voted to deprive Varavva of her parental rights.\n\nThe famous Pochaev Lavra monastery, which had been on the territory that the USSR annexed from Poland, underwent considerable persecution in this period and afterwards. It began to be troubled in 1959 when the local soviet tried to deprive the monastery of its livelihood by confiscating its ten hectares of agricultural fields and buildings used for its harvest. Then they deprived it of an apiary containing over 100 beehives. The monastery continued to receive financial support from pilgrims and the local community, which kept it functional, however. In 1960 the authorities forbade restoration work to be carried out on the premises, as well as any overnight visits of pilgrims anywhere on the premises. In order to enforce this, the militia began to raid the monastery at night, throwing out pilgrims sleeping in the yard or the main cathedral which the monks had kept open for devotions 24 hours. The police at the same time began raiding private homes in the vicinity for pilgrims. The pilgrims were both insulted verbally and often beaten severely, which produced several fatalities. In 1961 the authorities confiscated the Bishop's palace, which had been used to house pilgrims. Monks from other monasteries that had been closed had come to live at the Pochaev Lavra, but they were expelled by the militia at the time of the confiscation of the Bishop's palace.\n\nMany methods were used to empty the monastery. Some monks who were reported to be completely healthy by the monastery, were found by the Pochaev District Military Board to be mentally ill, and were forcefully incarcerated in a mental hospital and 'treated' for their supposed illness in such a way that one of them, a healthy 35-year-old, died after only a few months of 'treatment'. Another commission diagnosed six healthy monks with infectious diseases, which allowed for their removal. Thirteen monks were conscripted into military service and sent to fell trees in the north, and were not allowed to return to Pochaev. A novice came to the rescue of women pilgrims who were being beaten by the militia one night, and the militia beat him savagely in response, while the KGB later expelled him from the monastery.\n\nIn 1962 the authorities reduced the number of monks from 146 to 36. It began in March 1962 when the authorities informed the monks that they planned to close the monastery and that they should return to their place of birth. The monks refused this, and the authorities then began to threaten them with death if they did not comply. They took away residence permits from some of the monks and applied pressure to the elders of the monastery to expel more. The elders also did not comply. By September the militia began to kidnap monks off the premises into trucks and then drive them back to their native villages where they were left.\nThe official propaganda claimed that the monks left the monastery voluntarily.\n\nIt underwent a vicious campaign in the press where its inhabitants were depicted as a nest of fat, greedy, lustful loafers that were raping young female pilgrims and robbing people of their money. Its history was also maligned and it was described as being a nest of traitors who aided forces attacking Russia from the Middle Ages to the Second World War. It was even accused of disloyalty for condemning Ivan the Terrible. The authorities tried very hard to close the Pochaev Lavra through continual harassment and indirect persecutions, but failed. This case received much publicity that went beyond the Soviet Union (including to the United Nations), much information of the events escaped the USSR (hence there is an excellent record in comparison with many other things that occurred in Khrushchev's campaign), and the monastery also received much support from the local population, who even sometimes physically defended the monks from the militia; these factors contributed to its continued survival.\n\nPetitioners tried to reach the Patriarch, but he was powerless to do anything to solve the situation. Petitioners who complained of abuses were accused of slandering the Soviet government, and monks who went to petition to Moscow, were expelled from the monastery upon their return. A public official in Moscow commented to the petitioners, \n\nIn my opinion all believers are psychologically abnormal people and it is entirely natural for them to be sent into mental hospitals… it is our aim to liquidate religion as quickly as possible; for the time being we partially tolerate it for political reasons, but when a favourable opportunity arises we shall not only close down your monastery but all churches and monasteries.\n\nOn 12 June 1964 a 33-year-old woman who had sworn an oath of virginity named Marfa Gzhevskaia was attacked by the militia, who raped her and gave her injuries that resulted in her death the following day. The doctors, under police instruction, diagnosed that she had died from acute lung trouble. The police would wait by the public lavatories at night and capture people who came to it, confiscate their money, beat them and rape them if they were women.\n\nOn 20 November 1964 four monks were attacked in their cells by police and sent to prison on false charges. One of the monks was sent to a mental institution where he was given injections that made him an invalid for the rest of his life.\n\nThe persecutions of the monastery stopped in 1964 at the time of Khruschev's removal from power. A report existed that a mysterious circumstance concerning the leader of the persecutors may have affected this, in that his daughter had burned to death in strange circumstances and the father then took her bones to the Monastery for burial, and then moved away. His replacement persecuted the monastery even more viciously, but also mysteriously, he committed suicide suddenly and the campaign against the monastery ended. Expelled monks returned afterward, although some could not return as a result, reportedly, of dying in strange circumstances while they were away.\n\nSome persecution continued to exist after 1964, however. Several monks died after being tortured in 1965, and a few arrests were made in 1966.\n\nPeople continued to convert to religion to the frustration of the government, and it tenaciously remained widespread among the Soviet population. Some scholars have speculated that the Soviet attempt to eliminate religion was unachievable because religion was an intrinsic need of humans and communism was not a viable substitute.\n\nIt is estimated that 50,000 clergy had been executed by the end of the Nikita Khrushchev era since 1917. The number of laity killed likely greatly exceed this figure. Members of the church hierarchy were jailed or forced out, their places taken by docile clergy, many of whom had ties with the KGB.\n\nKhrushchev was removed from office in 1964 and Brezhnev took power. The anti-religious campaign was questioned, not on moral grounds, but on the principle that it did not appear to be producing desired results and it was greatly reduced in intensity in the following years.\n\n\n"}

Ukrainian branches of the SPC were founded in Winnipeg, Portage la Prairie, and Nanaimo in 1907, and four more followed in early 1908. There was also an unsuccessful attempt to launch a Ukrainian Socialist Alliance within the SPC during the same period. Relations with the SPC's predominantly anglophone leadership were sometimes difficult, and on some occasions Ukrainian party members accused their English comrades of chauvinism. The SPC leadership was, for its part, reluctant to sanction official networks for cultural communities in the party.\n\nIn November 1909, several Ukrainian members of the SPC convened a special Socialist Convention of Canadian Ukrainians in Winnipeg. Delegates advocated for a new organization that would facilitate effective communication among Ukrainian branches of the SPC, while also threatening to withdraw from the party if the Ukrainian community's requests for autonomy were not recognized. The FUSD was formally constituted shortly thereafter and held its first convention in Edmonton in August 1910. At this meeting, the party formally severed its ties to the SPC and aligned itself with the newly formed Social Democratic Party of Canada (SDPC).\n\nThe FUSD fielded one candidate in the 1911 Canadian federal election: Wasil Holowacky in the Manitoba division of Selkirk. He appeared on the ballot as an independent and received 234 votes for a third-place finish.\n\nThe FUSD changed its name to the USDP in early 1914. \n\nThe USDP was strongly opposed to participation in World War I, which it identified as an imperialist conflict. At a special conference in April 1915, the party passed a resolution that censured \"all socialists who support the war in principle\" and called for \"the world proletariat to establish a Third Revolutionary International on the ruins of the Second International. Several party members were subsequently arrested and placed in internment camps by the Canadian government.\n\nThe USDP strongly supported the February Revolution in Russia and some of its members welcomed the subsequent Bolshevik Revolution. \n\nThe Canadian government arrested several of the USDP's leaders in 1918, and year it banned the party outright on September 25 of the same year. At the time of its prohibition, the USDP had more than two thousand members across Canada. Several members of the party's left wing later joined the Communist Party of Canada after the CPC's formation in 1921.\n"}

In 1987 Bishop of Essen Franz Hengsbach withdrew her license to teach Catholic theology for disputing the virgin birth of Jesus. This effectively disqualified her from the post she had held for three years.\n\nRanke-Heinemann's sevenfold farewell to traditional Christianity contains the following:\n\n\n"}

The organization was founded in March 1988 to mobilize community opposition to the city's operation of the North River Sewage Treatment Plant, and the siting of the sixth bus depot in Northern Manhattan. \n\nWE ACT is dedicated to fighting environmental justice issues in the Northern Manhattan community.The organization focuses on urban quality of life issues such as climate justice, clean air, access to good jobs, public health, pollution, and sustainable and equitable land use. It works through citizen empowerment, lobbying, litigation, education, and community outreach to accomplish its goals.\n\nCurrently, WE ACT is one of several groups engaged in negotiations for a Community Benefits Agreement with Columbia University as part of the school's Manhattanville expansion plan. It is also renovating an abandoned brownstone for conversion into the WE ACT Environmental Justice Center, which will house office and program space as well as serve as a demonstration of various green building technologies.\n\nIn April 1986, the North River Sewage Treatment Plant began its operations on eight blocks of riverside property in West Harlem, New York. Soon after its opening, local residents from the predominantly African American and Latino neighborhood complained of noxious odors emitting from the plant and increased exposures to health hazards. Peggy Shepard, a local resident, who was elected as a political district leader in 1985, pressured local and state authorities to perform a study on the health effects of exposure to the treatment plant's emissions. The study found that the fumes may cause respiratory problems at high levels of exposure, triggering public backlash from West Harlem residents, demanding repairs be made on the facility.\n\nIn 1988 the New York Metropolitan Transportation Authority (MTA) attempted to construct a second bus depot in West Harlem, adjacent to an intermediary school. The MTA was met with strong community opposition, in the form of protests, lawsuits, and scientific research.\n\nDuring this period, the attention and discontent surrounding the operation of the North River Sewage Treatment Plant and the construction of a second bus depot in West Harlem, presented the need for a unified movement to address the unequal impact of environmental hazards on the minority community. Therefore, in March 1988 Peggy Shepard, Vernice Miller-Travis, and Chuck Sutton launched WE ACT to \"institutionalize resources in the community\" to build and educate a community dedicated to fighting environmental injustice and improving environmental health.\n\nWE ACT emphasizes the importance of citizen involvement in its campaigns and partnerships.It utilizes community-based participatory research to address environmental justice issues and improve the environmental health and quality of life of the Northern Manhattan community. WE ACT strives to educate community members and raise public awareness on issues effecting the health and quality of life of the community.\n\nThe construction of the North River Sewage Treatment Plant, was initially proposed for a site along the Hudson River at 72nd Street, a primarily white and affluent community; however, the site was rejected due to community opposition and logistical problems. Thus, the site relocated to 137th Street in West Harlem, a predominantly Latino and African-American neighborhood. Local residents were outraged by the new sitting of the sewage plant in their community, concerned it would worsen preexisting pollution problems. Despite community resistance, construction of the plant started in 1972 and was completed in 1985. When the plant began its operations in 1986, community members further voiced their concerns over noxious odors emanating from the plant effecting an area of almost two miles. Local residents remained indoors to escape the fumes, partly due to their fear of developing adverse health effects resulting from exposure to the fumes. A study by the New York Department of Energy Conservation (DEC), found the plant's emissions contained hydrogen sulfide levels 28% higher than the standard. Community discontent shifted into activism and in 1988 on Martin Luther King Day, WE ACT co-founders Peggy Shepard and Chuck Sutton, along with several others were arrested for blocking traffic around the treatment facility, as an act of protest against the poor operation and management of the plant.\n\nDue to lawsuits filed by community organizations, resistance from West Harlem residents, and pressure from WE ACT, city officials addressed the plant's operating issues in 1991 and located a design flaw that was causing the excess air pollution. After a prolonged court battle with the city and the Department of Environmental Protection (DEP), WE ACT came to a settlement regarding the operations of the sewage plant in December 1993. As a result, $1.1 million was set aside in a fund for communal environmental initiatives in West Harlem and WE ACT was made \"a monitor of the city's $55 million consent agreement to fix the plant\".\n\nIn an act of appeasement to the West Harlem community for the faulty operating of the sewage plant and occupation of limited open space, the state constructed a 28-acre state park known as the Riverbank State Park on top of the sewage plant in 1993. However, fumes and odors continued to seep out of the plant affecting local neighborhoods.\n\nToday the North River Sewage Treatment Plant is continuing to improve their facility and upgrade to meet higher air quality standards. In their most recent endeavors the facility has installed new duct work and fans to optimize odor control and reported air issues.\n\nNorthern Manhattan is home to one-third of \"the largest diesel bus fleet (4,000 vehicles) in the country\" operated by the New York Metropolitan Transportation Authority (MTA). WE ACT deemed the high concentration of bus depots had negative impacts on air quality and the subsequent health of Northern Manhattan community members.The organization associated the high rates of asthma in Northern Manhattan with concentrated levels of particulate matter (PM), an air pollutant released during diesel fuel combustion, emanating from the bus depots, major transportation routes, and heavy traffic throughout West Harlem. WE ACT also organized a media campaign, \"The Clean Fuel--Clean Air--Good Health Diesel Bus Campaign\", to raise public awareness on the risks associated with diesel exhaust and its ability to trigger asthma attacks. While it failed to influence New York's MTA to change its policies in favor of cleaner fuel alternatives, the campaign garnered a large amount of public support and attention, demonstrating the power of public media and community outreach.\n\nIn November 2000, WE ACT, filed a complaint with the U.S. Department of Transportation claiming that bus depots were disproportionately located in minority communities in Northern Manhattan, which houses six of the eight total bus depots in Manhattan, thus elevating the health risks associated with high exposure to harmful diesel exhaust.\n\nThe Department of Transportation found that the MTA violated Title IV of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and failed to meet the federal environmental impact analysis involving the construction, rehabilitation, and operation of bus depots and other facilities. This campaign led to the MTA's modification of bus depots and investment in clean-fuel buses, as well as increased public awareness pertaining to the dangers of fuel fumes and poor air quality.\n\nWE ACT states its mission is \"to build healthy communities by ensuring that people of color and/or low income residents participate meaningfully in the creation of sound and fair environmental health and protection policies and practices.\" The organization serves as an \"educational resource\" to galvanize citizen participation and activism on matters of \"environmental health and quality of life issues\".\n\nIn the United States the number of people suffering from Asthma has grown steadily every year. Healthcare professionals have referred to the alarming rise in asthma cases as \"a new epidemic\". The respiratory disease is characterized by chronic lung inflammation and episodes of airway constriction. While there is uncertainty on the exact cause of the disease, it is believed that \"genetic and environmental factors interact to cause asthma, most often early in life\". Recently, the focus has turned to the impact of environmental conditions, most notably the exposure to indoor and outdoor air pollutants or allergens. WE ACT states that a racial divide exists in air pollution, resulting in the disproportionate exposure of minority or low income communities to high levels of air pollutants. WE ACT works to improve the air quality of Northern Manhattan communities and reduce the incidence of asthma and other respiratory problems by addressing the sources and environmental risks producing harmful air pollutants.\n\nWE ACT focuses on asthma or clean air as one of its primary areas of concern, because of exceptionally high rates of asthma found in Northern Manhattan. The organization highlights the connection between environmental risks in the predominantly Latino and African-American neighborhoods, such as the disproportionate exposure to diesel exhaust and the ubiquitous odors from municipal facilities, and the highest asthma mortality and morbidity rates in New York. WE ACT the challenges the city and state to recognize and address air quality problems. Currently WE ACT, is collaborating with several community-based environmental organizations, such as the Deep South Center for Environmental Justice (DSCEJ), Green Door Initiative (GDI), and Jesus People Against Pollution (JPAP), on the \"National Asthma Disparities Project\". The project aims to study the disparities in asthma treatment across four different communities in the United States, by assessing the effectiveness of the Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA) \"Coordinated Federal Action Plan to Reduce Racial and Ethnic Asthma Disparities (Action Plan)\". \"The Action Plan\" was introduced in May 2012, to review federal efforts addressing asthma issues and develop a more effective collaboration among federal programs.\n\nThe Community Outreach and Engagement Core (COEC) is a collaborative program between the NIEHS Center for Environmental Health in Northern Manhattan, WE ACT, and other community stakeholders, working to understand and prevent the environmental aspects of diseases such as Parkinson's, Cancer, Asthma, and ALS through policy and legislation. The operations of the COEC focus on four Northern Manhattan communities: Central Harlem, West Harlem, Washington Heights, and Inwood. Other members of the program include organizations within a close proximity to Northern Manhattan, such as The Columbia Center for Children's Environmental Health (CCCEH) of Columbia University, The Harlem Center for Health Promotion and Disease Prevention, and the Harlem Hospital Center. One of the biggest accomplishments of COEC and WE ACT is the development of an Environmental Health Report Card. The report card assigns a grade to New York City communities based on measurements of indoor/outdoor air quality, recreational water quality, solid waste, open space, and the availability of healthy food. By communicating scientific and health research findings through initiatives such as family events and fairs, conferences, forums, and the Environmental Health Report Card, the COEC members seek to increase community awareness of environmental dangers and establish a consistent local involvement in environmental issues.\n\nWE ACT's involvement in Northern Manhattan communities allows COEC members to acquire information about local environmental health concerns. In turn, WE ACT acts as a bridge for the passing of information between research groups and low-income communities in Northern Manhattan.\n\nWE ACT has collaborated with members of diverse Northern Manhattan churches in an effort to raise public awareness of environmental issues. The goal of the partnership is to encourage people of faith to care about environmental issues and to educate religious figures so that they can inspire environmental justice activism throughout diverse communities that, traditionally, have not engaged in environmental justice issues. Faith Leaders for Environmental Justice focuses on three key points: Climate Justice, Food Justice, and Energy Consumption. The Climate Justice work group seeks to promote awareness surrounding the dangers of climate change and the behavioral alterations that can be made to mitigate the effects. In coordination with the Energy Consumption work group, one of the main points of the Climate Justice group is to teach people how to reduce their energy consumption and carbon emissions. The Food Justice work group aims to educate people about the barriers to healthy eating and the importance of purchasing healthy food, while bringing healthful food initiatives to low-income communities. Some of these initiatives include Community Sponsored Agriculture (CSA) projects, community and rooftop gardens, food drives, and food stamp outreach.\n\nThe Healthy Homes Project is a joint research initiative between the Columbia University Center for Children's Environmental Health (CCCEH). The project targets the unequal exposure of environmental hazards faced by children in minority or low-income communities and works to educate families on a number of known risk factors such as \"cigarettes, lead poisoning, drugs and alcohol, air pollution, garbage, pesticides, and poor nutrition\". Educating parents on environmental health risks, can protect children from developing asthma or cancer or from experiencing growth or developmental delays, among others.\n\n"}
