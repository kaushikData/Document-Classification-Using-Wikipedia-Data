Statute affords a tenant under an assured tenancy a degree of security of tenure. A tenant under an assured tenancy may not be evicted without a reasonable ground in the Housing Act 1988 and, where periodic, changes in rent are potentially subject to a challenge before a rent assessment committee.\n\nAssured tenancies were introduced by the Housing Act 1988 that applies to tenancies entered from its commencement date or those assured tenancies it converted from the Housing Act 1980. The Act replaced most of the greater rent protection under the Rent Act 1977 and in rarer cases, other Rent Acts. However, since 28 February 1997, all new residential tenancies with three exceptions are deemed to be assured shorthold tenancies. These exceptions are those excluded by notice before or after the tenancy, those specifying it is not a shorthold, and lettings to existing assured tenants.\n\nThe assured tenancy replaced the secure tenancy, with greater tenant protections, introduced by the Housing Act 1980.\n\nAn exception to this are assured tenancies which are converted from being regulated by the Housing Act 1980 (except if granted by approved bodies under ss56-68 of the Housing Act 1980 before 15 January 1989, and before that date the tenant made an application to the court under section 24 of the Landlord and Tenant Act 1954 (for the grant of a new tenancy), and on 15 January 1989 the 1980 Act tenancy is continuing by virtue of that section or of any provision of Part IV of the said Act of 1954.)\n\nThe term seemingly denoting \"home\", dwelling house, has been held to apply widely by the Courts, to exclude only businesses and highly indistinct factual arrangements of accommodation within a house or a flat (where the home is shared in an esoteric manner and no particular tenant or set of joint tenants can be said to be entitled exclusively the whole of any one part and anti-exclusion case law does not operate); flats and single rooms are included within the definition of a separate dwelling house as are converted barns, windmills etc.\n\nBecause domestic rates were abolished a distinction exists between tenancies granted before 1 April 1990 and those from that date. Before this a \"dwelling house\" (see above) tenancy with a rateable value of £750 (£1,500 in Greater London) (payable per year) cannot be an assured tenancy. From this date if the rent is more than £100,000 per year (£8,333.33 per month) it cannot be an assured tenancy.\n\nSimilar for those tenancies before that date, if rent is less than two-thirds of the rateable value, or if after that date it does not exceed £250 per year (£1,000 per year in Greater London) it cannot be an assured tenancy.\n\nThese detailed areas include a tenancy under which agricultural land, exceeding two acres, is let together with the dwelling-house.\n\nTo be exact this excludes tenancies to which part II of the Landlord and Tenant Act 1954 applies. Tenancies eligible to be protected business tenancies (contracted out business tenancies) or partly let for business use are ineligible to be assured tenancies.\n\nThis does not apply to tenancies involving landlords other than the specified universities and colleges.\n\nA letting for this purpose cannot be assured.\n\nThis applies where the landlord lives in another part of the same building in which the let accommodation is situated.\n\nAlthough these are excluded, lettings by local authorities and housing association may have other protections, such as secure tenancies under the Housing Act 1985.\n\nIt is possible for a person to have more than one \"home\" in which case it is a legal question of fact as to whether a home is the principal home. Although this provision stipulates \"occupation\" this need not be continuous, if a mere temporary absence this will still be capable of being an assured tenancy.\n\nWhether a tenancy is assured can vary depending on circumstances after the tenancy commencement. It may be that the tenant has not by eviction ceased to live in a tenancy in which case they are no longer occupying the dwelling as their principal home. Here the tenant thus loses security of tenure. or, if the tenancy agreement gives the landlord a power to end the tenancy, by the landlord exercising that power. If a fixed term assured tenancy comes to an end in one of these ways but occupation continues, known as \"holding over\", a periodic assured tenancy will from that event be created, known as a statutory periodic tenancy. Security of tenure remains.\n\nIn order to regain possession, the landlord may do so only on one of a number of statutory grounds, which are set out in Schedule 2 of the Housing Act 1988. To obtain an order for possession, the landlord must serve a \"section 8 notice\" on the tenant, setting out the ground or grounds that are relied on and then, after a period of time that varies depending on the grounds chosen, apply to the court for possession.\n\nUnlawful eviction of a tenant is a criminal offence (under s1 of the Protection from Eviction Act 1977) unless the landlord reasonably believed the tenant was no longer in the premises, is sharing living accommodation with the tenant or is letting the property for holiday purposes.\n\nRent without specific provision under an assured, periodic tenancy cannot be increased within 52 weeks of commencement, and unless a statutory (implied) periodic tenancy, this may only be increased upon the service of a \"section 13 notice\" in the appropriate form for England or for Wales, however as with general contract law a historic lease amendment or new lease neglecting such a notice before such an increase accepted by the tenant will be deemed to have supervened, preventing the tenant from relying on an earlier contract in not serving a section 13 notice.\n\nNaturally where fixed term and not periodic, and where a rent review clause exists in the periodic tenancy, contractual arrangements also avoid the need for the section 13 notice. The section 13 notice gives the right to the tenant to challenge the rent set under section 14 before a rent assessment committee where it is unreasonable that the market would charge such a rent, disregarding improvements performed by the tenant to the property where they were not obliged to carry these out.\n\nFrom 28 February 1997 most tenancies are deemed to be assured shorthold tenancies (ASTs) under which the landlord has an absolute right to possession where having served a notice on the tenant, before this date they had to be accompanied by a prescribed warning, fixed term, and for at least six months.\n\nThe only aspect of a shorthold which allows the tenant some control over the tenancy is the right of the tenant to refer the rent initially payable to a rent assessment committee, however it can reduce the rent only if it is \"significantly higher\" than the rents under other comparable assured shortholds. In this unusual scenario, the landlord can serve a notice before or after the tenancy has begun stating it is not to be a shorthold, where no rent assessment application has been made. In other regards, except security of tenure, as a subset of assured tenancies these follow the definition requirements of an assured tenancies.\n\n"}

Late 1930, the audit branch had been altered to a department, and was renamed with \"Accounts Audit Department\" under the ministerial resolution published in the Official Gazette No.271, 9 August 1930.\n\nThe Department of Audit and Verification of Accounts was established in 1931 when the a Law of Audit and Verification of Accounts was passed under which the department had been attached to the Prime Ministry, in 1939 it was disconnected from the Prime Ministry and connected to the Ministry of Finance. It was connected back and forth between the Prime Ministry and the Ministry of Finance until 1952, the year in which the Law of the Audit Bureau of Jordan passed.\n\nThis is the stage in which the Audit Bureau as a constitutional body has been established in 1952, in accordance with the Constitution of Jordan which was issued on 8/2/1952.

Though technically not a \"battle\", it became known as such in the media while official sources such as the Truth and Reconciliation Commission (TRC) simply refer to it as an \"incident\". Much of its notoriety lies in the fact that it marked the first occasion the South African security forces used lethal force against right-wing white protesters since the National Party's ascension to power in 1948.\n\nThe confrontation took place outside the Ventersdorp town hall where then State President F.W. de Klerk was scheduled to hold a public address. Ventersdorp was then a political stronghold of the right-wing Afrikaner Weerstandsbeweging (AWB), which had opposed de Klerk's decision to recognise the African National Congress and release Nelson Mandela the previous year. The town was inundated by angry AWB supporters the day of de Klerk's speech, including some carrying arms. The South African Police responded by setting up roadblocks and confiscating weapons. Tensions were running high between the police and the AWB due to a previous incident on 11 May 1991, when a group of policemen wounded four AWB militants attempting to drive black squatters off a Ventersdorp farm.\n\nThe AWB supporters numbered 2,000. They were armed with hunting rifles and pistols and wore protective items to shield them from the effects of an inevitable tear gas attack by the riot police. The police equalled the AWB in number, but were considerably better trained and equipped.\n\nMany unconventional tactics were employed by the AWB. They allegedly wore plaster of Paris on their limbs to protect them from police dogs. Video footage shows AWB members locking arms and carrying rags and vinegar to lessen the effects of tear gas.\n\nOnce the AWB cut the electricity and fired on the police, the police were ordered to shoot to kill. Three policemen were wounded, none of them fatally, while the police killed one AWB member. The AWB also fired into a police minibus. Two AWB members were killed and 13 were injured when the police returned fire from the minibus.\n\nTerre'Blanche made a point of appearing in front on television cameras and said (in Afrikaans), \"Where is De Klerk? I want to talk to him. He came here armed. Here lies a man on the ground and over there lies a man\" (referring to injured policemen).\n\nIn all, three AWB members and one passer-by were killed. Six policemen, 13 AWB members, and 29 civilians were injured.\n\nThe growing conflict between right-wing groupings and the government has been identified as one of the most significant developments in the course of 1991, with the Battle of Ventersdorp as its high point.\n\nThe events in Ventersdorp, as well as gains by the right-wing opposition in white by-elections, led De Klerk to call a referendum in March 1992. The referendum confirmed white support for the negotiation process, despite continued opposition from the far right.\n\nFollowing the end of apartheid, Terre'Blanche and his supporters sought amnesty for the Battle of Ventersdorp and other acts. Amnesty was granted by the Truth and Reconciliation Commission.\n\nThe three dead AWB members, A.F. Badenhorst, G.J. Koen and J.D. Conradie were honoured at an AWB ceremony in October 1994, in Ventersdorp. A monument still remembers their death.\n\n"}
{"id": "577440", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=577440", "title": "Busy work", "text": "Busy work\n\nBusy work (also referred to as make-work and busywork) can refer to activity that is undertaken to pass time and stay busy but in and of itself has no actual value. Busy work also occurs in business, military and other settings, in situations where people may be required to be present but may lack the opportunities, skills or need to do something more productive. People may engage in busy work to maintain an appearance of activity, in order to avoid criticism of being inactive or idle. The Merriam Webster dictionary defines busywork as \"work that usually appears productive or of intrinsic value but actually only keeps one occupied.\" \n\nIn the context of education, busy work allows students to work independently, to test their own knowledge and skills, and to practice using new skills learned in the educational setting. It can consist of various types of schoolwork assigned by a teacher to keep students occupied with activities involving learning and cognition while the teacher focuses upon another group of students. The functionality of busy work is associated with levels of interest students have with the content of the work, levels of enjoyment students have in performing the work, how purposeful the work is, and how accomplishment of the work is perceived by students. The perceived results of the work by students is significant: when students feel that they've succeeded in accomplishing a functional task, it's congruent with learning and the attainment of new skills.\n\nBusy work can also be used to keep the students occupied with educational tasks during idle times, such as instances when time in school remains but the day's curriculum has already concluded. This application of busy work to consume idle time was common in primary education, but the need for work to have educational content, rather than existing just to consume time, is now preferred.\n\nBusy work has historical precedent in primary education. Conditioning students to believe that busy work carries the same value as progressive work can lead to students maintaining this belief later in life, carrying it through to the workplace.\n\nIn business and work settings, people may engage in busy work simply to appear like they're being busy and productive, with the primary goal of actually simply maintaining an \"appearance\" of activity in efforts to protect their employment status (to avoid termination or sanctions). Workers believe that it is more important to maintain a constant appearance of working urgently so that they and others believe that what is being done is important. Constant urgency in workers can lead to disproportionate distribution of actual work, as workers may put off important work by attempting to complete previously-designated less important work. Maintaining very high levels of constant busyness may actually be detrimental to the operations of a business or organization in which new tasks are not undertaken in a timely manner because workers are always very busy. That can also lead to workers taking shortcuts to accomplish tasks more quickly, which can negatively affect the quality of work results. Busy work also can be counterproductive in work settings because it may not be aligned with the overall objectives and priorities of an organization's plans for attaining and maintaining success in its ventures. The assumption that activity in the workplace is more important than productivity in the workplace can lead to employees thinking that quantity of work is better than quality of work, which is not productive to the overall functioning of a business.\n\nBusy work is used in armed forces to keep servicemembers from becoming bored, inactive and idle. Tasks of this sort include drill, memorizing regulations, getting haircuts, spit and polishing footwear and other cleaning chores such as scrubbing the deck.\n\n\n\n"}

In the United Kingdom, for example, the phrase was added to the royal style in 1521 and has continued to be used to this day. According to the \"Royal Proclamation reciting the altered Style and Titles of the Crown\" of May 29, 1953, the latest such change of royal title, Elizabeth II's present full title is\n\nIn other Commonwealth realms, variations of the style are used, specifying the realm in question and varying some of the other elements of the title.\n\nOriginally, it had a literal meaning: the divine will was invoked—notably by Christian monarchs—as legitimation (the only one above every earthly power) for the absolutist authority the monarch wielded. This is also known as the divine right of kings, that is, the endorsement of God for the monarch's reign.\n\nWhile the Christian Roman emperors during the late Dominate, especially in the East (as continued in Byzantium after the fall of Rome), came remarkably close to acting out the role of God's voice on earth, centralizing all power in their hands, e.g. reducing the Patriarch of Constantinople to their \"(State) Minister of the Cult\" and proclaiming their \"universal\" authority (in the Oriental tradition, as in Persia, but also in the original Muslim Caliphate), for most dynasties it would rather prove to be a never-ending battle up the hills of political resistance, both from rival power poles within their state (nobility, clergy; even within a dynasty) and from foreign powers claiming independence or even hegemony, usually constraining them in constitutional limitations (not necessarily written statutes, more often a matter of customary law and established privileges).\n\nBy custom, the phrase \"by the Grace of God\" is restricted to sovereign rulers; in the feudal logic, a vassal could not use it, because he held his fief not by the grace of God almighty, but by grant of a superior noble, (in)directly from the crown. Yet this did not stop kings to continue using it, even when some of them did homage to the pope (as viceregent of God) or another ruler (sometimes even mutually), on account of some (minor or \"external\") fief, or even for their actual principality, such as the Kingdom of Bavaria, a state of the Holy Roman Empire.\n\nWhile the \"incantation\" of divine Grace became a prestigious style figure that few Christian monarchies could resist, it is not a literal carte-blanche from Heaven, but rather a consecration of the \"sacred\" mystique of the crown. Some of that survives even in modern constitutional monarchies and finds expression in most even mildly religious republics and dictatorships, where all power has been transferred to elected (party) politicians. In modern, especially recently (re-)founded monarchies, more realistic power reports (often crucially a voice in the succession and the purse strings) do in time find expression, sometimes even in abandoning \"By the Grace of God\", or rather, especially earlier, in the intercalation of compensatory phrases, such as \"and the will of the people\", or replacing the genitive \"sovereign of X-place\" by \"sovereign of the X-inhabitants\", quite meaningful where linked to the Enlightenment-notion of the \"social contract\", which means the nominal 'sovereign' is in fact potentially subject to national approval, without which a revolution against him can be legitimate.\n\nThe phrase was used in Luxembourg until 2000, when Henri, the current Grand Duke, decided to drop it. Like the use of the term \"subject\" for the citizens of a monarchy, \"by the Grace of God\" is a protocolary form that has survived the emancipation of the electorate from its once absolute rulers, who now rule only in name, but without direct political power. During the 20th century during the dictatorship of Francisco Franco in Spain, Spanish coins bore a legend identifying him as \"Francisco Franco, por la G. de Dios Caudillo de España\" (\"by the G(race) of God, Leader of Spain\").\n\nParallels exist in other civilizations, e.g. Mandate of Heaven of the Chinese empire, where for centuries the official decrees by the Emperors of China invariably began with the phrase 「奉天承運皇帝，詔曰」 which is translated as \"The Emperor, by the Grace of Heaven, decrees\".\n\nToday, even though all western monarchies are constitutional, with all political power having passed to the people (by referendum or, generally, elections), the traditional phrase \"by the grace of God\" is still included in the full titles and styles of a number of monarchs. In Europe, monarchs still using the style are those of Denmark, Liechtenstein, the Kingdom of the Netherlands, and the United Kingdom.\n\nIn other Commonwealth realms, who share the same monarch with the United Kingdom, the style is used in Antigua and Barbuda, Australia, The Bahamas, Barbados, Belize, Canada, Grenada, Jamaica, New Zealand, Solomon Islands, St. Kitts and Nevis, St Lucia, St. Vincent and the Grenadines, and Tuvalu. Papua New Guinea does not use the style.\n\nThe phrase is not used in the monarchies of Belgium, Luxembourg (Jean, abdicated 2000), Monaco, Norway (Haakon VII, died 1957), and Sweden (Gustav VI Adolf, died 1973). In Spain, article 56(2) of the 1978 constitution, states that the title of the King of Spain is simply \"King of Spain\" (\"Rey de España\") but that he \"can use the titles that correspond to the Crown\". As a result, the King of Spain may use \"by the grace of God\", but this is not used on official documents.\n\nGermanic languages:\n\nRomance languages:\n\nSlavic languages:\n\nOther languages:\n\nSimilar concepts unrelated to and sometimes predating Christianity:\n\nIn some cases, the formula was combined with a reference to another legitimation, especially such democratic notions as the social contract, e.g.\n\n"}

He created the C. Lotti & Associati engineering firm. He was born and died in Rome.\n\nLotti graduated from the Roman Institute of Technology at the top of his class. He served in World War II until the ceasefire of September 1943 and then decided to join the liberated southern Italy and became captain.\n\nLotti lectured on “Methodology of hydraulic works” at the Roman Technical University. His professional career started in 1946 with Cidonio construction company. In 1957 he founded the engineering company bearing his name.\n\nLotti married Marcella Bini MD and had two children. His daughter, Patrizia is the president of the Society and his son, Massimo, is a lawyer.\nIn 1977 Carlo was nominated as a Knight of the Republic by the president of Italy. He founded the association of civil engineers in Italy (OICE) and was the honorary president of the Italian Hydrotechnical Association.\n\nLotti participated in numerous projects, from 1957 together with his associates and then as a company C. Lotti & Associati SpA.\n\nThe first project in Africa on behalf UNDP, concerned the economic feasibility of agricultural production and river transport.\n\nIn 1973 the European Community entrusted Lotti for the construction of a dam on the Sankarani river, tributary to the Niger, near the town of Sélingué. The 35m high dam was completed under the supervision of the designer in 1980. The electric power generated non only covers the domestic demand but it is also exported to the neighboring countries. Furthermore, the dam controls the flood, and, above all, provides for a rich fishery.\n\nThe creation of the Bakolori dam in the Northern Nigeria, in collaboration with Nuovo Castoro company, is of great importance. The project includes a large dam equipped with 3MW hydropower plant and the irrigation scheme for 23000 ha. A second project in the area was the Goronyo Dam with a reservoir of one billion m³.\n\nThe complete basin planning requires the participation of experts from several sectors: hydrology, hydraulics, agriculture, economy, engineering and others. A mathematical is capable of handling all factors together. The methodology was developed at the Harvard University. Important project derived from the collaboration between Lotti and the Harvard group for optimal use of water resources.\n\nA first project concerned the Sava river, tributary to the Danube. The UNDP project was assigned jointly to Lotti and Hydroject of Prague. The model selected 32 reservoirs out of the 57 examined.\n\nThe first application of the method within Italy was the Tiber project, under the direction of IRSA.\n\nAfter the disastrous flood in 1966, that severely damaged the historical center of town, it was imperative to examine the possible solution for flood protection. The complexity of the project led to the application of a mathematical model. The result of the model indicates the optimal set of works needed for the use of the waters.\n\nThe Emilia Region contains several tributaries to the Po river. A complex network of artificial canals connects these rivers. The projects analyzes the resources and the demand for different uses. The company Idroser of the Emilia Region participated in the project and was entrusted for the implementation.\n\nThe Plan for the Waters of the Sardinia region analyzed all the aspects of the current and potential future uses of the waters. In a first phase data were collected on hydrology and potential water demand. In the next phase the existing and possible future works were studied. The third phase applied the data to a mathematical model for the selection of the optimal solution that can satisfy the future demand and provide protection against flood hazard.\n\nLotti created a research institute, Hydrocontrol, specializing on water resources. The institute trained thirty young researchers.\n\nThe quality of the waters of the Piracicaba basin in Brazil was studied with a mathematical model. The result indicates the degree of treatment necessary.\n\nLotti participated in the international contest for the design of the bridge across the Messina strait. The area of relevant study regarded a new under water foundation procedure. The solution presented received a price but the final choice for construction is based a single span, which will be the longest in the world.\n\nLotti went to China for the first time in 1971 with the Italian Foreign Commerce Ministry delegation. Successively, a project for flood control management started in 1982. The Italian Technical Cooperation financed the project. The aim of the projects was not only the development of the plan but included the training of the personnel and supply of a pilot measuring network. The study area was the river Han, tributary to Yangtze. A large dam was built for flood control and hydropower. The optimal management of the dam is of great economic and environmental significance. Another, similar project concerned the river Huai.\n\nThe loss of water in municipal network represents and significant reduction of the available resources. The detection and repair of the losses is a convenient way of finding “new resources”.\n\nLotti carried out several project with help instruments and mathematical models for the search of losses. In Messina, of pipe was examined and the relevant measuring instruments put in operation. Similar projects were carried in Reggio Calabria, Catania, in Aosta.\n\nAlso outside of Italy, water networks were monitored, e.g., Bucharest in Romania, Durrës in Albania, in Ukraine, in Moldavia, and in Nkayi, Congo.\n\n\n\n"}

He was elected to the Pratinidhi Sabha in the 1999 election on behalf of the Nepali Congress. In 2001, he was included as an Assistant Minister of General Administration in Sher Bahadur Deuba's expanded cabinet. In that cabinet he served under Minister of General Administration Khem Raj Bhatt Mayalu. After the 2006 uprising against monarchy in Nepal, Lama was included in a Parliamentary Sub-Committee, organized to investigate the assets of the king.\n\nLama had, in his function as a police official, issued an arrest warrant in the 1980s for Mayalu, who was then considered as a terrorist by the Nepalese government. \n\nDil Bahadur Lama had joined the Nepal Police on Fagun 28, 2007 BS as the Warrant Officer 1 at the then Sadar Nepal Armed Constabulary and upgraded to the IGP post on Asar 1, 2039 BS.

If all residents are of the same ethnic group it's zero by definition. If half are from one group and half from another, it is .50. The diversity index does not take into account the willingness of individuals to cooperate with those of other ethnicities. \n\nThe Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities affirms to \"respect difference and acceptance of persons with disabilities as human diversity and humanity\" for protection of human rights of persons with disabilities.\n\nPolitical creeds which support the idea that diversity is valuable and desirable hold that recognizing and promoting these diverse cultures may aid communication between people of different backgrounds and lifestyles, leading to greater knowledge, understanding, and peaceful coexistence. For example, \"Respect for Diversity\" is one of the six principles of the Global Greens Charter, a manifesto subscribed to by Green parties from all over the world. In contrast to diversity, some political creeds promote cultural assimilation as the process to lead to these ends.\n\nThis use of \"diversity\" in this sense also extends to American academia, where in an attempt to create a \"diverse student body\" typically supports the recruitment of students from historically excluded populations, such as students of African-American or Latino background as well as women in such historically underrepresented fields as the sciences.\n\n"}

{"id": "49219174", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=49219174", "title": "Fabric of Security", "text": "Fabric of Security\n\nThe Fabric of Security , also known as \"Cyber Security Fabric\" or \"Federated Security\", refers to systems designed to protect the Information Systems infrastructure of the home, a corporation or government from malicious attackers. Protection in this sense means, guaranteeing the confidentiality, integrity, and the availability of the information stored in the system (\"SYSTEM\"), and its elements or components.\n\nUnlike endpoint security, network security, web application security, and Internet security, Fabric of Security Systems assume that attacks will be successful, and cannot be averted. Therefore, the emphasis shifts from attempting to prevent unauthorized access to that of minimizing the time to detect the unauthorized access, the time to isolate the unauthorized access from doing harm, and finally, the time to remove the offending process and reconfiguration of the system back into a \"SAFE\" state.\n\nSecurity refers to processes and systems designed to protect the assets of an individual, system and/or organization from harm. Computer Security (aka, cyber security) refers to processes and systems designed to protect computer and/or information system assets from harm. In general, such assets are: (1) information/ data, (2) programs and applications, and (3) services. Protecting assets from harm means:\n\nConfidentiality – assets are used/access only by authorized parties (also refer to as secrecy or privacy)\n\nIntegrity – assets can be modified only by authorized parties and only in authorize ways (“insider threat”)\n\nAvailability – assets are available to authorize parties at time to.\n\nIn 1971 Butler Lampson in his now classical paper Protection introduced the general model of protection of computer or information system assets which has withstood the passage of time. By enlarge, all protection systems implemented to date follow Lampson's original formulation shown here in Figure 1 entitled \"Access Control Model of Protection\". Fundamentally the universe is divided into two classes Principals, who access Resources. A Resource is an object for which a protection policy has been established. Access to Objects is restricted via a protection system, called a reference monitor, that implements the protection policies of the system. Namely the reference monitor or \"Guard System\" must: (1) identifies the identity of the Principal claiming access to an object - Principal is who are you?, (2) authentication - validates that the Principal claiming access to an object is who he/she/it claims to be - are you who you say you are?, and (3) authorization - is the principal claiming access to an object authorized to access said object.\n\nIn the past, the protection model that most organizations applied to protect their infrastructure was simply the \"Everything but the Kitchen Sink\" model—meaning, add devices that protect the enterprise network perimeter (Trusted Zone), add devices that protect your mobile device, add devices that protect your database. In essence, this model simply advocated for the accumulation of security devices. As we pointed out earlier, see section 1.0, this model has failed.\n\nIn addition, the idea that cyber-attacks can be stopped at the periphery of the network has become a fool's errand. In today's Circa 2020 computing environment and cyber-threat landscape, individuals as well as corporations have recognized the fact that (i) threats are often distributed in nature both in time and space, making detection extremely difficult, and (ii) the working assumption is not that you can prevent infections (the goal of 100% prevention is no longer practical), but rather, given that your \"system\" will be compromised, how quickly can you detect the breach and how do you minimize the impact of such an event? In the future, the basis of competition for security products and services will be the ability to provide early warnings and execute countermeasures that minimize damage from cyber-attackers. The problem is not about single or even multiple independent security devices each providing some amount of absolute protection. Rather, information from all your security products and services need to be correlated, scrutinized and transformed into wide-angle actionable information in order to minimize the most likely threats of damage by cyber-attackers in your specific enterprise environment, see Figure 3. We call this approach the “Fabric of Security.” It is a layered model that easily accommodates distributed deployment of security in multi-vendor environments.\n\nIn 2013, the Wireless Systems Security Research Laboratory (WSSRL) started the development of a first-reference implementation of the Fabric of Security called FOSA. The purpose of FOSA was to use proven techniques from the areas of distributed processing, computer architecture and clustering algorithms, to build a viable, real-time security system capable of protecting the corporate infrastructure of the Circa 2020 computing model. FOSA was intended to be the first implementation of the Fabric of Security architecture, while at the same time remedying some of the limitations of current security system implementations. Specifically, the stated goal for the design was to avoid stand-alone solutions while incorporating the ability to deal with reliability issues, meaning, the best security product/solution is no good if either it fails to operate as specified (Fault Tolerant) and/or is compromised by the attacker (Resilient to Attacks). It must be able to withstand attacks directly against itself, and be able to protect itself from being compromised or disabled.\n\nIn this section, we provide a brief overview of the FOSA system and its major components. However, in this manuscript we will not cover the reliability and adaptability elements of the architecture, and the use of Byzantine Agreement, see [4], to build resiliency into the system.\n\nThe architecture of FOSA is shown here in Figure 4. FOSA is a distributed system based on layer component architecture. In each FOSA node, a set of components in a hierarchical structure provide the traditional security functions found in most implementations. At the lowest level of the hierarchy, Layer0, we find the traditional data gathering component or SENSORS/Probes. Unlike other systems, SENSORS in FOSA can be custom data collectors or simply gather data from other security systems, such as FIREWALLS, and AV systems. In the latter case, SENSORS gather the data by monitoring the output of a variety of systems outputs, such as Snort, and the syslog file on Linux. The data collected by the SENSORS serve as input to the next layer in the hierarchy, Layer1, the S-Event Generator or SEG. The SEGs function as a data abstraction layer. They collect the data from the SENSORS, filter it, convert it into a platform independent format, and provide the aggregated, filtered data to the next layer of the hierarchy, the Secure Host Manager or SHM in the form of events. The events are queued for further analysis by the SHM. In addition to this, the SEGs start and stop the SENSORS. In this context, the SHM can be consider as the local IDS/IPS that makes decisions about all activities that it monitors both host- or network-based. A critical component of the SHM is the Analysis Engine AE. The AE retrieves events from the Event Queue, processes them, and makes a final determination as to the probability that a successful attack will be launched, and/or an attack is in progress at the local level. This probability falls into one of three ranges. These are:\n\n0 ≤ p{Attack in Progress or a Compromise has occurred } ≤ Φ1 - No ATTACK<br>\nΦ1 ≤ p{ Attack in Progress or a Compromise has occurred } ≤ Φ2 - There is insufficient data at the local level to make a decision. In addition, in some situations this is an indication that the local node has been compromised.<br>\nΦ2 ≤ p { Attack in Progress or a Compromise has occurred } - ATTACK detected\n\nIn the first case, the SHM is sure that the events processed do not represent an attack or elements of an Attack, and therefore the system continues operation without further actions. However, in the next two cases a potential attack has taken place or is in progress. In such a case, the SHM immediately initiates countermeasures. The first of which is to stop all further processing of events, disable all remote access to the node, and notify the next level of the hierarchy, the Distributed Threat Intelligence Manager/Engine (DTIM), that a potential failure or attack is in the making. Further, in the case that the SHM is sure the host has been compromised, then, the SHM also sends a “last gasp” message to the DTIM. Once it sends the “last gasp” message, the SHM stops the SEGs, stops processing data from the SEGs and launches countermeasures to restore the node to a healthy state.\n\n2.1.2 Distributed Threat Intelligence Manager/Engine (DTIM)\n\nAs previously mentioned, FOSA is a real-time, distributed system based on the concept of autonomous agents. Its structure is similar to the architecture proposed in the AAFID system. However, it differs from it in at least three significant ways. These are:\n\n\nIn the architecture, the Distributed Threat Intelligence Engine/Manager (DTIM) consists of two major components: (1) the Distributed Trust Manager (DTM) which performs the critical functions of Fault Tolerance and Attack Resilience, and (2) the Distributed Threat Intelligence Correlation Engine (TICE) that performs the function of Threat and Event detection globally.\n\n2.1.2.1 Distributed Trust Manager (DTM)\n\nThe DTM performs several essential functions. These are:\n\n\nThe creation of a Trust Domain and the formation of an initial group have been discussed in a previous work, see [2] in detail. However, because nodes can be compromised and their status can change over time, the DTIM must have the capability of expelling members and reconfiguring itself. This process of reconfiguration is initiated by either the receipt of a “last gasp” message from a member or when the DTM reconfiguration timer expires. The basic process works as follows. Upon receipt of a “last gasp” message, every node in the Trust Domain will initiate the reconfiguration by:\n• Sending a set of test patterns to the node suspected of being compromised. The test pattern matrix consists of a set of known intrusion vectors, as well as a set of non-intrusion patterns. Upon formation of the initial group, and every time that membership in the Trusted Domain changes, the matrix is reconstituted and distributed among all members. The matrix is distributed in such a way that no single member group of members colluding (as long as k, k N-1)/ 2; where k is number of colluding members), has complete knowledge of all test patterns\n\n2.1.2.2 Distributed Trust Manager component of the DTIM in FOSA- An Abstract Model\n\nOne of the key components of the Distributed Threat Intelligence Manager/Engine is the Distributed Trust manager of DTM. The DTM is built upon the principles of replication, consensus, and the ”wisdom of crowds.” In order to understand the behaviors of the FOSA system, it is important that an abstract model of the Trust Domain (TD) is presented. Here we present such a model. Let M = {C, Cnew, P, X, α}, be an abstract representation for a Trust Domain. This model allows us to reason as to the correctness of the DTM component of the Threat Intelligence/Engine. One potential side benefit of the model is that it will allow us to identify holes in our design. The basic components of the model, C, P, X, and α are defined below.\nC = {c1, c2, c3, ..., cn}, for some finite integer n, is the set of nodes in the Trust Domain. A node within this context is any Security Device that is collecting data and making decisions about the possibility of an attack. While n could be very large, for practical purposes associated with the implementation of DTM, we limit n to 16.\n\ncnew = cj |cj ∈/ C, which is a node that is trying to join a Trust Domain. The state, w, of cnew is unknown at the time that cnew declares its intention to join a Trust Domain. That is, cnew may be a node whose behavior is in accordance with the Trust Domain admission and security policies (“uncompromised node”) or it may be compromised.\n\nα = {α1, α2, α3, ..., αm} is the set of actions that a node may perform. A node is essentially a deterministic finite automaton. Thus, it has a finite set of states, a finite set of input symbols and a transition function [3]. The transition function is analogous to the set of actions a node may take based on the input the node receives. Since the input alphabet is finite and the number of states is finite, the set of actions, α, which a node may take, is finite.\n\nP = {p1, p2, p3, ..., pk} is a security policy which describes the acceptable behaviors of a Security Device in the Trust Domain. Each pi is a rule composed of a subject, an object and an action that the subject may perform on the object. We note that security policies are rarely defined completely, as it is difficult to list every possible rule that is acceptable. Thus, we accept that we will have to add new rules to the policy as new acceptable actions that a node may perform on an object are discovered. It should be clear that P ⊆ α. We also note that ¬P ∪ P = α.\n\nX is a capability matrix, which indicates what actions the subjects can perform on the objects and/or on each other. The subjects here are the nodes. The objects are the data and the services running on the nodes. Xij represents all the actions that subject subjecti can perform on object objectj . In other words, for each object oj on computer nodek, Xij gives the set of actions, αl ∈ α that computer nodek can execute on behalf of subjecti on object 0j .\n\nUsing this model, we defined a capability and policy matrix for our experimental Trust Domain, see Figure 5, with corresponding security policy P ={p1, p2, p3, ..., pk } below.\n\n2.1.2.3 Security Policy\n\nWe define several variables and constants that are necessary to define the security policy, P. The variables are:\n\nOSi =the current operating version on nodei\nFOSAi = FOSA software version nodei\nresponsei,x = the response nodei gives to nodex in the TD when it is interrogated\nopinioni,x = the belief of nodex in the TD about whether nodei is compromised majorityi,x = the majority belief of all the nodes in the TD about whether nodei is com- promised after the parallel Signed Message Algorithm has been completed\nmessageTamperedi = whether messagei has been tampered with\n\nThe constants present in the security policy are:\n\nOST = the minimum acceptable O/S version for a node to join the TD\nFOSAT = the minimum acceptable version of the FOSA software \nresponsec = the correct response of a node to an interrogation\ncompromised = the majority belief that the node trying to join the TD is compromised\nuncompromised= the majority belief that the node trying to join the TD is safe\n\nUsing this model, we defined a capability and policy matrix for our experimental Trust Domain, see Figure 5. The corresponding security policy P ={p1, p2, p3, ..., pk } is defined below. Based on these definitions, the security policy can be described as follows:\n\np1: Given a node, ci ∈ Cnew, that is attempting to join a TD, then, if the value of OSi < OST, then ci is not allowed to join TD <br>\np2: Given a node, ci ∈ Cnew, that is attempting to join a TD, then, if the value of SAFEi < SAFET, then ci is not allowed to join TD <br>\np3: Given a node, ci ∈ Cnew, that is attempting to join a TD, and a node cx in the TD, then, if the value of responsei,x = responsec, then opinioni,x = compromised <br>\np4: Given a node, ci ∈ Cnew, that is attempting to join a TD, and a node cx in the TD, then, if the value of responsei,x = responsec, then opinioni,x = uncompromised <br>\np5: Given a set of nodes, c1, ..., cx, in a TD, a node ci not in TD, and a majorityi,x = compromised, then, cx does not open a socket connection to ci (preventing ci to join TD). <br>\np6: Given a set of nodes, c1, ..., cx, in a TD, a node ci not in TD, and a majorityi,x = uncompromised, then, cx opens a socket connection to ci (thus allowing ci is to join TD). <br>\np7: Given nodes cx and cy are nodes in a TD, and cx receives messagei from cy, such that messageTamperedi = T rue, then, cx discards messagei as if it was never received.\n\n2.1.3 Threat Intelligence Correlation Engine (TICE)\n\nTICE or the Threat Intelligence Correlation Engine is a global engine whose inputs are the events generated by the SHM module at a lower level of the hierarchy, local information as to the configuration of the environment under protection, global information as to the current threat level in the particular region and the corresponding and pertinent threat landscape at the time of the events. The output of TICE is threat evaluations, actionable intelligence, and threat countermeasure recommendations. Similar to its lower level counterparts at Layer2 - the SHM, TICE evaluates & correlates events and ascertains the correlation of such events into three distinct possibilities:\n\n0 ≤ p{Attack in Progress or a Compromise has occurred } ≤ Φ1 - No ATTACK/Intrusion\n\nΦ1 ≤ p{ Attack in Progress or a Compromise has occurred } ≤ Φ2 - Insufficient Data\n\nΦ2 ≤ p { Attack in Progress or a Compromise has occurred } - Attack/ Intrusion present\nThe values of Φ1 and Φ2 are tunable.\n\n2.1.4 Logging and Presentation Services - Issuance of Countermeasures (LAPIS)\n\nLAPIS represents the top layer of the architecture, and it is the module where actionable intelligence is presented to an administrator for further action and/or where automatic countermeasures are issued throughout the protected environment. \nIn the simplest implementation of the FOSA architecture, LATIS is the equivalent of a Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) module. It provides visual information to the security officer/administrator as to the state, real time threats that have been detected and the overall integrity of the protected environment.\n\nTypical SIEM capabilities such as: (1) Security Event Management (SEM), (2) File Integrity Monitoring (FIM), (3) Configuration Management Database (CMDB), and (4) Availability and Performance Monitoring (APM) are part of this layer.\nHowever, unlike your typical SIEM, the LAPIS layer provides for automatic countermeasure generation, repair and recovery, as well as manual mode where forensics and countermeasure issuance is based on a probabilistic model with tunable Φ1 and Φ2 parameters.\n"}
{"id": "26297764", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=26297764", "title": "Family Movement", "text": "Family Movement\n\nThe Family Movement, also known in the past as the Parent Movement, is an arm of the disability rights movement, a larger social movement. The Family Movement advocates for the economic and social rights of family members with a disability. Key elements include: social inclusion; active participation; a life of meaning; safety; economic security; accessibility and self-determination. The family movement has been critical in closing institutions and other segregated facilities; promoting inclusive education; reforming adult guardianship to the current supported decisionmaking; increasing access to health care; developing real jobs; fighting stereotypes and reducing discrimination.\n\nIn the late 1940s and early 1950s families spontaneously across Canada, the US, England, France, Scandinavia, Australia and New Zealand began asserting a different vision, a different lifestyle and a different future for their sons and daughters with intellectual disabilities, mental handicaps and developmental disabilities. These isolated, independent developments eventually coalesced into the first wave of the 'parent movement'. They organized and demanded services for their sons and daughters. Their efforts eventually resulted in the UN Declaration on the Rights of Disabled Persons, December 9, 1975. (Note: while this terminology is not used today it was the commonly accepted terminology 6 or 7 decades ago.) This has subsequently been eclipsed by the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities which was equally influenced by the emerging and now very strong consumer 'independent living' arm of the disability movement.\n\nIn those early formative days families around the world began to question the accepted wisdom that they should institutionalize their son or daughter with a disability. But parents were isolated from each other. They had no way of knowing who else felt the same way. It was not easy for parents to get to know each other. Some resorted to placing ads in newspapers. Even here they faced challenges as some newspapers felt it was inappropriate to advertise the fact you had a child with a disability. It is hard to understand today but this was the accepted wisdom of the time.\n\nAs they started coming together families began to create opportunities, programs and supports for their sons and daughters. They created programs with few resources. Taking over church basements to set up schools; borrowing chalk, discarded books from school boards who would not accept educational responsibility for educating their sons and daughters.\n\nThese parents and their community supporters formed the Associations for Retarded Children. These organizations are now called Associations for Community Living in Canada. Following their example organizations for people with cerebral palsy (concurrent time period of the Arc), hearing and visual impairments, autism and other handicapping conditions were started. Parents were also involved as parent-professional partners at university centers, and were given additional funds to begin cross-disability offices, and even family support agencies with preferential hiring practices.\n\nThree famous Americans (two parents and one brother) had a major impact on public perceptions of disability in the 1950s and 1960s. One was Nobel Prize winner Pearl Buck who wrote about her daughter Carol in the book \"The Child Who Never Grew\". The other was Dale Evans who starred with her husband Roy Rogers in a popular television western wrote \"Angel Unaware\" about her daughter with Down Syndrome. The third was President John F. Kennedy, whose sister Rosemary had a mental handicap. In 1961 he launched the President's Panel on Mental Retardation which became the President's Committee on Mental Retardation. These three combined with the work of parents and family members brought the issue out of the closet, eased the stigma of having a child with a disability and became a major source of hope for families.\n\nIn 1961 the International League of Societies for the Mentally Handicapped was formed. This organization is now called Inclusion International.\n\nThe UN Declaration on the Rights of Disabled Persons was adopted by the United Nations General Assembly on December 9, 1975.\n\nOne of the most important contributions to the parent/family movement was the introduction of the concept of Normalization (people with disabilities). Originating in Denmark with Erik Bank-Mikkelsen and Bengt Nirjeit normalization principles were adapted in North America by Wolf Wolfensberger. Dr. Wolfensberger fully supported families, and to some extent, parental control in decisionmaking. Wolfensberger wrote his seminal work in Toronto in the early 1970s as a visiting scholar to the Canadian Association for the Mentally Retarded and the National Institute on Mental Retardation – the national bodies for the local parent founded organizations. Wolfensberger's theory is now called Social Role Valorisation.\n\nEventually with persistence, patience and ingenuity the government funded system of social, educational and health programs and services took shape.\n\nBy the 1980s the parent/family movement had successfully established a comprehensive program and service infrastructure which was court-mandated in some states and developed through major state and regional governmental offices. It was natural for them to support their sons and daughters who were creating their own movements, including the Independent Living movement which had strong roots in the 1970s laws (e.g., Rehabilitation Act of 1973) and self-advocacy movement which obtained university parent-professional support in its inception.\n\n\n\n\nThe AHRC New York City was founded in 1949.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "6235157", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=6235157", "title": "French law on colonialism", "text": "French law on colonialism\n\nThe 23 February 2005 French law on colonialism (, \"Law No. 2005-158 of 23 February 2005 regarding recognition of the Nation and national contribution in favour of the French repatriates\") was an act passed by the National Assembly, which imposed on high-school (\"lycée\") teachers a requirement to teach the \"positive values\" of colonialism to their students (Article 4, Paragraph 2). The law, particularly the aforementioned paragraph and Articles 1 and 13, created a public uproar and drew massive opposition from the left, and Article 4, Paragraph 2 was repealed by president Jacques Chirac (UMP) at the beginning of 2006, after accusations of historical revisionism from various teachers and historians, including Pierre Vidal-Naquet, Claude Liauzu, Olivier Le Cour Grandmaison and Benjamin Stora. Its Article 13 was also criticized as it supported former Organisation armée secrète (OAS) militants. \n\nAt the end of Algerian War, upon independence in 1962, 900,000 European-Algerians (\"\") fled to France within a few months in fear of the FLN's revenge. The French government was totally unprepared for the vast number of refugees, which caused turmoil in France. The majority of Algerian Muslims who had worked for the French were disarmed and left behind as the treaty between French and Algerian authorities declared that no actions could be taken against them. However, the Harkis in particular, having served as auxiliaries with the French army, were regarded as traitors by the FLN and between 50,000 and 150,000 Harkis and family members were murdered by the FLN or by lynch-mobs, often after being abducted and tortured. About 91,000 managed to flee to France, some with help from their French officers acting against orders, and they and their descendants form a significant part of the Algerian-French population.\n\nThe controversial Article 4 asked teachers and textbooks to \"acknowledge and recognize in particular the positive role of the French presence abroad, especially in North Africa\". This was considered by the left-wing and many in the former colonies as a denial of the problems of colonialism. There was rising antagonism both nationally and internationally until the law was repealed at the start of 2006. Abdelaziz Bouteflika, president of Algeria, refused to sign the envisioned \"friendly treaty\" with France because of this law. On 26 June 2005, he declared that the law \"...approached mental blindness, negationism and revisionism.\" Famous writer Aimé Césaire, leader of the \"Négritude\" anti-colonialist literary movement, also refused to meet then-UMP leader Nicolas Sarkozy. The latter cancelled his visit to the overseas department of Martinique, where a thousand people demonstrated against him in Fort-de-France. Sarkozy was elected president in 2007.\n\nUMP deputy Christian Vanneste was criticized for having introduced the expression \"rôle positif\" French for \"positive values\" in the text. On 25 April 2005, more than a thousand professors and thesis students had signed the petition \"Colonisation: No to the teaching of an official history\". MP Christiane Taubira called the law \"disastrous\" and enacted because of lobbying from the harkis and the Pieds-Noirs, remaining silent on the \"Indigenate Code\" or forced labour in the former colonies.\n\nSupporters of the law were decried as a resurgence of the \"colonial lobby\", a term used in late 19th-century France to label people (deputies, scientists, businessmen, etc.) who supported French colonialism. In defiance of this revisionism, Chirac finally turned against his own UMP majority that had voted for the law, and declared:\"In a Republic, there is no official history. Writing history is the business of historians: it should not be circumscribed by laws.\" He passed a decree charging the president of the Assembly, Jean-Louis Debré (UMP), with modifying the controversial law, to take out the revisionist article. In order to do so, Chirac ordered Prime minister Dominique de Villepin to refer the matter to the Constitutional Council, hoping the decision would allow such a decree to repeal the law. The Constitutional Council indeed decreed that the regulation of history textbooks is an administrative matter, not a legal one, and as such, the contested amendment was repealed at the beginning of 2006.\n\nIn a tribune \"Liberty for History\", 19 historians (including Élisabeth Badinter, Alain Decaux and Marc Ferro) demanded the repeal of all \"historic laws\": not only the 23 February 2005 Act, but also the 1990 Gayssot Act against \"racism, xenophobia and historical revisionism\", the Taubira Act on the recognition of slavery as a \"crime against humanity\", and the law recognizing the Armenian Genocide. Historians found this demand controversial. While many agreed that the state should not be determining history, few believed that the previous acts had to be repealed. Some opposed the Gayssot Act and other laws, but thought repealing them would be perceived as a kind of condemnation of the ideas.\n\nThe debate on the 23 February 2005 law was linked to a wider debate in France concerning colonialism and current issues of immigration. As the historian Benjamin Stora pointed out, people interested in colonialism have a major \"memory\" stake in influencing the way various communities and the nation represent themselves. Official state histories generally have a hard time accepting the existence of past crimes and errors. The Algerian war of independence (1954–62), characterized at the time by the French government as a \"public order operation,\" was only recognized as a \"war\" in 1999 by the French National Assembly. In the same sense, philosopher Paul Ricœur (1981) has said that there has to be a \"decolonization of memory\", because mentalities themselves have been colonized during the \"Age of Imperialism.\"\n\n"}

{"id": "44910427", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=44910427", "title": "Imperial hunt of the Qing dynasty", "text": "Imperial hunt of the Qing dynasty\n\nThe imperial hunt of the Qing dynasty was an annual rite of the emperors of China during the Qing dynasty (1644–1911). It was first organized in 1681 by the Kangxi Emperor at the imperial hunting grounds at Mulan (modern-day Weichang Manchu and Mongol Autonomous County, near what would become the summer residence of the Qing emperors at Chengde. Starting in 1683 the event was held annually at Mulan during the autumn, lasting up to a month. The Qing dynasty hunt was a synthesis of earlier Chinese and Inner Asian hunting traditions, particularly those of the Manchus and Mongols. The emperor himself participated in the hunt, along with thousands of soldiers, imperial family members, and government officials.\n\nThe Manchu emperors of the Qing dynasty used the hunt as a military exercise to train their troops in the traditional martial skills of archery and horsemanship. The hunt was also a bonding ritual intended to emphasize the shared Inner Asian martial traditions of the Manchu and Mongol soldiers of the Eight Banners who were selected to participate (Han Chinese troops were excluded from the hunt). The event provided an opportunity for Qing emperors to leave the confines of the Forbidden City in Beijing and return to the forests \"north of the wall\", closer to their ancestral homelands, where they could hunt and live as their ancestors did. As the Manchus grew accustomed to living in Chinese cities, Qing emperors expanded and ritualized the imperial hunt as a sort of invented tradition, using it to preserve the traditional Manchu way of life. The Qianlong Emperor made it a key element of his effort to halt the steady decline of military discipline within the Eight Banners during his reign.\n\nEach year, for the duration of the hunt, Mulan served as a temporary capital and a venue for diplomatic activities. The Qianlong Emperor required the leaders of Inner Asian tributary states to join in the hunt on a rotating basis, and he frequently received foreign emissaries there rather than in the imperial palace at Beijing. To facilitate the continued operation of the imperial government in the emperor's absence, many government officials accompanied the emperor to Mulan, where they lived and worked in a tent city replicating the layout of the Forbidden City, exchanging correspondence regularly with Beijing and Chengde.\n\nAltogether, the Kangxi, Qianlong, and Jiaqing Emperors participated in 91 hunts during their reigns. As an important element of Qing military culture, and an embodiment of Manchu identity, the Qing imperial hunt featured regularly in the official artwork and poetry of the Qing dynasty. It was the subject of several paintings by Giuseppe Castiglione, the Italian Jesuit who served as a court painter to Qianlong. Images of the hunt, much like images commemorating victories in battle and other military subjects, were regularly commissioned by the imperial court as a form of propaganda, portraying Qing emperors as exemplars of traditional martial (\"wu\") values.\n\nHunting has been an important element of Chinese elite identity since at least the Zhou dynasty. Hunting, warfare, and animal sacrifice were intimately linked in the culture of the Zhou aristocracy. As Chinese society became progressively more agrarian, hunting was transformed into a ritual activity associated with the elite. Because the bow and arrow were used both for hunting and for waging war, the practice of archery became a defining trait of the proper gentleman of the Zhou period. A common theme throughout Chinese history is the juxtaposition of hunting and warfare. As one Zhou dynasty writer put it:\n\nIn the classic 14th century novel \"Romance of the Three Kingdoms\", Chancellor Cao Cao of the Han dynasty states: \"The kings and emperors of ancient times held four grand hunts yearly, riding forth from the capital each season to show the world their prowess.\" These four seasonal hunts were the spring hunt (), summer hunt (), autumn hunt, and winter hunt (). Such ritual hunts were regular events in the Tang dynasty, and were sometimes criticized for their extravagance. Emperors, however, saw hunting as an important military exercise. Emperor Taizong of Tang defended his frequent hunting, saying: \"At present the empire is without trouble, but military preparations cannot be forgotten.\"\n\nAlthough it was known by the same Chinese name (\"qiuxian\") as the autumn hunts of Chinese antiquity, the autumn hunt of the Qing dynasty was more directly influenced by the hunting practices of the Inner Asian horse cultures. The Manchus who conquered the Ming dynasty and founded the Qing were themselves part of that tradition. The Qing empire encompassed not only Manchus but also Mongols, Turkic peoples, and other steppe nomads. Like the Mongols of the Yuan dynasty and the Khitans of the Liao dynasty, the Manchus of the Qing practiced a form of \"battue\" hunting, in which groups of soldiers would encircle a large area of forest and drive their prey into clearings where they could be shot. This style of hunting was called \"aba\" in Manchu.\n\nAs recorded by Marco Polo, Kublai Khan had a hunting preserve near his summer capital at Xanadu (Shangdu). The khan hunted there regularly during his reign. Mongol and Khitan khans considered hunting an important form of military training, and practiced it regularly. For steppe nomads like themselves, hunting was still an important part of daily life, and not just an idle pursuit of the upper classes as it had become among the Han Chinese. Emperor Taizong of the Khitan Liao dynasty echoed Emperor Taizong of Tang when he remarked, \"Our hunting is not merely the pursuit of enjoyment, but a means of practicing warfare!\"\n\nThe Jurchens of the Jin dynasty, ancestors of the Manchus, organized their military units along the same lines as their hunting parties. This practice was carried on by the Manchus. From these units emerged the companies, called \"niru\" (\"arrow\"), that formed the basic building blocks of the Eight Banners military system that went on to conquer China. The pre-conquest Manchus participated frequently in organized hunts. In 1630, before the capture of Beijing, Hong Taiji established a hunting ground near the old Qing capital of Mukden (Shenyang). However, it was his grandson the Kangxi Emperor who would start the tradition of regular annual hunts.\nThe tradition of hunting at Mulan in the autumn came about as the result of Kangxi's 1681 hunting expedition in lands belonging to his Mongol allies, near the site of the former Yuan capital Shangdu. These lands were gifted to Kangxi at the end of his visit. In 1683, Kangxi returned to hunt again and the lands were established as an official hunting preserve, and bounded by a willow palisade.\n\nThe hunting preserve was located in Rehe (Jehol) province, which has since been divided among the provinces of Hebei, Liaoning, and Inner Mongolia. It occupied a densely forested area where Mongols had hunted for generations. The area contained 67 clearings, called \"hoihan\" in Manchu, that animals could be driven into as part of the \"aba\" hunt. These clearings usually had Mongolian names, reflecting the area's history as a traditional Mongol hunting ground. For much of its history, it was known simply as \"the hunting ground at Rehe\". The Chinese name Mulan () is a phonetic translation of the Manchu term \"muran\", which refers to a hunting method in which hunters would whistle for deer, using decoy deer heads as a lure. An 1807 inscription by the Jiaqing Emperor refers to the hunting preserve as Mulan/Muran, and today the area is called Mulan Weichang (). It is located in Weichang Manchu and Mongol Autonomous County in Hebei.\n\nDuring the Kangxi era, plentiful game was to be found at Mulan. The emperor was able to hunt not only deer, but also tigers, bears, leopards, and wolves. Qing emperors enjoyed the beauty of the natural environment, and the escape it provided them from urban life in the capital. As Kangxi wrote:\n\nLord Macartney, who visited the Qianlong Emperor at Rehe in 1793 during the Macartney Embassy, gave the following account of the area:\n\nWithin the preserve Macartney also found \"palaces, banquetting houses, and monasteries,\" accessed by roads \"hewn out of the living rock\". From a hilltop pavilion, he saw around him \"so rich, so various, so beautiful, so sublime a prospect [his] eyes had ever beheld\". In the later years of the Qianlong era and in the Jiaqing era, however, illegal poaching and logging in the preserve became a serious issue. Jiaqing observed in the early 1800s that the damage to the local ecosystem had made it very difficult to hunt there.\n\nIn 1705, the Kangxi Emperor created a hunting office within the Eight Banners to manage the preserve at Mulan. The headquarters of its Chief Controller was located in Chengde. All but one of the officials who held this position were Manchus, the one exception being a Mongol. In 1749, responsibility over Mulan was given over to the Lifan Yuan, which supervised the Qing dynasty's Mongolian dependencies. The Qianlong Emperor increased the number of officials at Mulan in 1753. During his reign, the number of hunting guards increased from 191 to 800. The number again increased to 950 under the Jiaqing Emperor. Hunting guards at Mulan were selected among bannermen from the capital, and were responsible for preventing poaching, squatting, and illegal logging, as well as for managing the wildlife in Mulan's sixty-seven (later seventy-two) hunting zones. With few exceptions, all permanent construction was banned in the preserve. In 1764, responsibility for Mulan was given back to the Eight Banners, under the lieutenant general of the Rehe garrison. Throughout its history, the administration of the Mulan preserve was staffed entirely with Manchus and Mongols.\n\nThe first hunt at Mulan was in 1681, when the Kangxi Emperor hunted there as a guest of his Mongol allies. With him on that occasion were 3,000 Mongol riders, a small number of bannermen of the Eight Banners, and a retinue of officials from Beijing. After receiving the land as a gift from the Mongols, Kangxi hunted there each year starting with his second visit in 1683. Participation in the hunt was expanded to include troops from the Eight Banners of Beijing and the Banner garrisons of Nanjing, Hangzhou, Jingzhou, and Xi'an. The best archers and riders of each garrison were selected to participate, based on their performance on tests earlier in the year. Only Manchu and Mongol bannermen could be selected, reflecting the hunt's Inner Asian character. Hunts were large-scale affairs involving thousands of participants; in addition to bannermen, there were Mongol princes and government officials present. Kangxi had delicacies such as strawberries grown near the grounds so they could be enjoyed by his hunting party.\n\nThe construction of the Chengde Mountain Resort in Rehe began during Kangxi's reign. The resort was established as a summer residence for the Qing emperors. Its location was north of the Great Wall, halfway between the wall and the hunting grounds at Mulan. Each year, the emperor would depart Chengde during the autumn and travel with his entourage to Mulan, a distance of seventy-five miles. Although Chengde was said to be a place to escape the heat of Beijing in the summer, in fact Kangxi usually stayed there into autumn, and sometimes returned in the winter.\n\nExcept when he was away on campaign, Kangxi hunted annually at Mulan until his death in 1722. In his later years, Kangxi insisted on continuing to hunt, despite needing to be carried in a sedan chair. Kangxi's son, the Yongzheng Emperor, never hunted at Mulan as an emperor, though he had done so as a prince. Yongzheng regretted his failure to continue the custom, and instructed his sons to maintain their hunting skills.\n\nThe next emperor to hunt at Mulan was Qianlong, who revived and expanded his grandfather's tradition. Mulan held deep significance for Qianlong, who erected a stele there in 1751. Concerned about the disappearance of traditional Manchu ways in his generation, he wrote to one of his generals, \"From the third year [of my reign] the former institution of the regular training hunt will be begun. Only then will I know whether you have truly practiced as you have preached.\" From the emperor's point of view, the hunt was the only way to maintain the skills of his troops at shooting from horseback.\n\nThe Qianlong Emperor held over forty hunts in his reign, and received foreign dignitaries at Chengde when he was away from the capital. Hunts were usually cancelled in years when the emperor visited the imperial tombs at Mukden, or for important diplomatic events. The visits to Chengde of Amursana in 1754, the Sixth Panchen Lama in 1780, and Lord Macartney in 1793 all resulted in such cancellations. As a venue for such visits, Chengde's location north of the wall and its proximity to the hunting grounds emphasized the Inner Asian heritage of the Manchus and made it the ideal location to receive emissaries from the societies of Central Asia.\n\nLike his father Qianlong, the Jiaqing Emperor considered the Mulan hunt to be of vital importance. The inscription of his 1807 stele (\"Record of Mulan\") at the hunting preserve, placed near that of his father, stated that \"Mulan is our nation's hunting ground.\" Jiaqing reaffirmed the hunt's importance as both a representation of Manchu identity and as a form of military training. Acknowledging that his own riding and shooting skills were probably inferior to those of his father, he proclaimed, \"I surely will not take up idle, leisurely ways.\" In the final words of his inscription, the Jiaqing Emperor wrote:\n\nJiaqing, however, was the last emperor to hunt regularly at Mulan. His son, the Daoguang Emperor, discontinued the practice after ascending the throne, and no more hunts would occur thereafter.\n\nIn the early years of the Kangxi era, before the construction of the Chengde complex at his behest, the emperor would travel directly to Mulan in the fall. Kangxi's entourage lived off the land, hunting and camping along the route to Mulan. The emperor wrote of roasting venison over an open fire, and making tea with melted snow. On his 1711 trip, after construction had begun at Chengde, it is estimated that 12,000 people may have accompanied him from the resort. During Qianlong's reign, the emperor's usual practice was to first go to Chengde in the summer, and then proceed to the hunting grounds later in the year. Before departing for Chengde, the emperor and the imperial family would participate in ceremonies in Beijing. Tibetan lamas were present to pray for the success of the hunt. The emperor would usually return to Beijing just after the end of the hunting season. The trip to Chengde from Beijing took seven days, with the emperor and his large entourage stopping at lodges stationed along the way. According to Lord Macartney, whose party took this route to reach Chengde in 1793, each day's segment of the trip was short enough to be completed by mid-day or afternoon. Macartney estimated the distance from Beijing to be about 131.5 miles.\n\nThere were two parallel roads between Beijing and Chengde, one for the emperor and one for other authorized persons. While traveling the route, Macartney observed a large number of troops repairing the road in anticipation of the emperor's return trip to Beijing. The road was known to become muddy after heavy summer rains, as observed by the Jesuit painter Jean Denis Attiret. It crossed several rivers, at which bridges or ferries were provided. In some areas, Macartney found the road \"very rough\" and difficult to travel. Along the route were guard posts at approximately five mile intervals, each staffed by a handful of soldiers to provide security.\n\nScheduled hunting activities at Mulan included both the eponymous \"muran\" variety as well as large-scale \"aba\" hunts. Several thousand soldiers were required for the \"aba\" hunt. A temporary imperial camp would be placed north of the hunting site. On the day of the hunt, the participants would be split into a left wing and a right wing, arrayed in two semi-circular groups spread out over a distance of several miles. Once the two semi-circles had joined, the wing leaders would order the men to close in. The circle would then be reduced to a size of two or three li in circumference, gathering the prey within.\n\nThe emperor, having arrived at the campsite by this point, entered the enclosure on horseback and had the honor of the first shot. To protect him from potentially dangerous game such as bears or tigers, the emperor would be accompanied by a number of troops such as the \"tiger-gun brigade\". If a tiger was caught, the emperor usually killed it personally, as part of the spectacle demonstrating the bravery and martial skill of the imperial lineage. In 1692, the Kangxi Emperor killed a bear by wounding it with an arrow and finishing it off with a pike. Under the Kangxi Emperor, tiger hunts were conducted by having captive animals brought in cages, and then releasing them into the hunting grounds.\n\nWhile the emperor was hunting at Mulan, the business of government continued. The \"traveling camp\" of the imperial government was arranged so as to mirror the layout of the government offices around the Forbidden City. Messengers relayed information between Beijing, the Chengde resort, and Mulan, allowing the emperors and his entourage of imperial officials to do their work in the field. According to one official, there were no desks in the tents, and work had to be done by candlelight.\n\nAt the end of the hunting season, the emperor held a feast for all participants, followed by a special feast just for Mongol and Uyghur leaders. Such events were an opportunity for the emperor to spend time with his Inner Asian subjects, many of whom did not travel south to China proper for fear of smallpox. In addition to banquets, the emperor also presented and received gifts, and gave out titles. Many entertainments were provided, including archery and wrestling contests, as well as mock battles. Lord Macartney, in his 1793 mission, observed wrestling, acrobatics, juggling, theatre, and fireworks displays, but was disappointed that an expected display of feats of horsemanship did not appear, as he had heard that the \"Tartars\", as he called them, were quite skilled in such arts. During the performances, Macartney noted that the audience was completely silent. Macartney, eager to get on with his diplomatic mission, was nonetheless obliged by court etiquette to watch these displays and receive gifts from the emperor throughout the day.\n\nThe hunts at Mulan were commemorated in paintings produced by the imperial court, much like other military rituals of the Qing. This was especially true in the Qianlong era, in which commemorative art also portrayed the triennual grand inspections (\"dayue\") of Eight Banners troops, and the dual rituals of dispatching armies (\"mingjiang\") and welcoming their return (\"jiaolao\"). These works of art, as well as the activities depicted in them, all formed part of the Qianlong Emperor's propaganda campaign to promote martial values in Qing society.\n\nMany of these paintings were done under the direction of Giuseppe Castiglione, the Jesuit missionary who served as one of Qianlong's court painters. A number of paintings produced during Qianlong's reign portray the emperor himself participating in the autumn hunt at Mulan, as well as in the other military rituals of the Qing. In particular, Castiglione produced a series of four scroll paintings about the Mulan hunt. He and his apprentices also produced a number of horse paintings, reviving a subject that had not been popular since the Tang dynasty. A Kazakh horse presented as a gift to the Qianlong Emperor serves as his mount in Castiglione's painting of the grand inspection of the troops, as well as in paintings of the emperor hunting. Copies of martially-themed paintings were disseminated widely in a variety of formats, conveying a message of military might both at home and abroad, as well as impressing a martial stamp upon domestic mass culture.\n\nMulan, and later Chengde, also played an important diplomatic role. It was at Chengde that Qianlong received the Macartney Embassy, cutting short his hunting trip to do so. As part of the Qing emperors' patronage of Tibetan Buddhism, several temples were built in the Tibetan style around Chengde, including the Puning Temple (1755, modeled after Samye Monastery), and the Putuo Zongcheng Temple (1771, modeled after the Potala Palace). It was also at Chengde that the Sixth Panchen Lama visited Qianlong in 1780, for which occasion the Xumi Fushou Temple was erected. At the hunting sites of Mulan, the Kangxi Emperor met with Khalkha, Kharchin, and Dörbet leaders. Likewise, Qianlong often pronounced edicts affecting Inner Asians at the hunting grounds.\n\nThe hunt itself, its proximity to the Yuan dynasty summer capital of the Mongols, the practice of living in tents or yurts, and the banquets held in honor of Mongol officials, all served to ingratiate the emperors of the Qing dynasty with their ethnic Mongol subjects and allies in particular, as well as Inner Asians generally. From the beginning of the Qing dynasty, Manchu emperors positioned themselves not only as the emperors of China, but also as Great Khans in the mold of Genghis and Kublai. Originally the khan of the later Jin dynasty, Hong Taiji renamed his empire the Great Qing and declared himself its emperor in 1636 after receiving the surrender of the Chahar Mongols. The Qing sponsorship of Tibetan Buddhism was inherited from the Mongol tradition. The secondary capital and its hunting grounds, both outside the Great Wall, thus bolstered the Qing emperors' rhetoric of having brought the inner (Chinese) and outer (Mongol, Tibetan, Uyghur and so on) peoples together into one \"family\" (\"neiwai yijia\").\n\nThe Qing dynasty imperial hunts became increasingly elaborate and ritualized over time, particularly under the Qianlong Emperor. As hunting became uncommon among the Manchus, the majority of whom lived in the walled city of Beijing or the various Eight Banner garrisons throughout the empire, the imperial hunt at Mulan became one of the last contexts in which Manchu hunting skills could be practiced, and only by a select few. The institutionalization of the hunt led to its new role as a sort of performance, a stylized homage to past practices that were no longer living traditions for most Manchus. Hence, Elliott has referred to the Qing hunting tradition as an invented tradition, an \"adaptation of an older practice for newer purposes\". This adaptation emphasized what Qing emperors considered most important in Manchu culture as they saw it, namely their supposed embodiment of martial (\"wu\") values, as opposed to the civil (\"wen\") values that they attributed to the Chinese (see wen and wu). The Qianlong Emperor likened himself to Emperor Taizong of Tang, who represented a balance of \"wen\" and \"wu\". Yet despite presenting themselves as the head of a family encompassing both Chinese and Inner Asian traditions, Qing emperors constantly worried about Manchu acculturation and the adoption of Chinese ways.\n\nPart of the imperial hunt's new significance was its perceived value as a form of military training. A Qing dictionary defined the \"aba\" hunt as a way of \"training for military proficiency\". Theoretically, all Manchus were part of the hereditary warrior caste of the Eight Banners, a military organization which expanded rapidly to include Mongol and Han Chinese contingents during the Qing conquest of the Ming. Military skill, hunting, and Manchu ethnic identity were deeply intertwined. As John Bell wrote, Kangxi saw the hunt as a way to prevent the Manchus from acquiring the perceived Chinese traits of \"idleness and effeminacy\". Kangxi's fears had been shared by his grandfather, Hong Taiji, who believed that the Jin dynasty of his Jurchen ancestors had collapsed as a result of entering the \"Chinese Way\", to the neglect of their archery and riding skills. The Yongzheng and Qianlong Emperors frequently criticized slipping standards and laziness among the troops of the Eight Banners. Qianlong, unlike Kangxi, Hong Taiji, and Nurhaci, never led military campaigns in person. The annual hunt, as reinstitued under Qianlong, thus represented the best remaining opportunity he had to personally direct his armies in their military training, as well as to regularly reaffirm old Manchu ways through codified ritual in the face of a rapidly shifting Manchu culture.\n\n"}

It is pending implementation in several cities. IRV is commonly used for student government and other non-governmental elections.\n\nBetween 1912 and 1930, limited forms of IRV (typically with only two rankings) were implemented and subsequently repealed in the states of Florida, Indiana, Maryland, Minnesota, and Wisconsin. In the 1970s, it was implemented and repealed in Ann Arbor, Michigan. More recently, it was adopted and repealed in Pierce County, Washington (2006-2009); Burlington, Vermont (2005-2010); Aspen, Colorado (2007-2010); and in North Carolina, which allowed its use in elections between 2006 and 2013.\n\nIn 2016, voters in Maine approved an initiative to become the first state to use IRV statewide in elections for governor, state legislature, U.S. Senate, and U.S. House. Despite efforts by the state legislature and state supreme court to delay the implementation of IRV, a \"people's veto\" referendum campaign kept the IRV law in place, with the state supreme court ruling that IRV would be introduced for the primary on June 12, 2018. In that election, Maine voters re-affirmed implementation of IRV by popular referendum while using IRV for the first time in primaries for the offices of governor, U.S. House, and state legislator.\n\nIn November 2018, Maine's ranked-choice voting system affected the outcome of the election for Maine's 2nd congressional district. Though the Republican incumbent Bruce Poliquin led the first-round count by over 2,000 votes, Democratic candidate Jared Golden won with a majority of nearly 3,000 after votes for independent candidates Tiffany Bond and Will Hoar transferred to the top two candidates.\n\nMaine Question 5, 2016 asked Maine voters whether to implement instant-runoff voting for primary and general elections for governor, U.S. Senate, U.S. House and state legislature, starting in 2018. It was approved by 52% to 48%, making Maine the first state to use instant-runoff voting for all such elections. However, on May 23, 2017, the Maine Supreme Judicial Court issued an advisory opinion stating that the state constitution specified that for general elections for governor and the state legislature only a plurality was required to win, which is not consistent with the use of instant-runoff voting and its multi-round vote transfers to ensure majority support. A \"people's veto\" referendum campaign suspended the law delaying RCV. In April 2018, the Maine Supreme Judicial Court ruled against a legal challenge seeking to preference IRV from being used in the state's elections starting in June 2018.\n\nThe legislature in June debated legislation to propose a constitutional amendment, to repeal the measure entirely, and to keep instant-runoff voting in place for elections for U.S. Senate, U.S. House and primaries. All bills failed to pass in the regularly scheduled legislative sessions filed to pass, but the legislature voted in October 2017 to delay implementation until 2021, by which time either a constitutional amendment must be adopted or the entire law would be considered repealed. Maine voters then collected enough signatures to force a \"people's veto\" of the parts of the new law that blocked use of instant-runoff voting for primary and congressional elections. The people's veto, Question 1, passed in the June 12, 2018 election, which was also the first election that used IRV for state and federal offices, including Republican and Democratic primaries for governor, Democratic primary for the 2nd Congressional District, and Republican primary for House District 75.\n\nA 2006 law had established that IRV would be used when judicial vacancies were created between a primary election and sixty days before a general election. In November 2010, North Carolina had three IRV elections for local-level superior court judges, each with three candidates, and a statewide IRV election for a North Carolina Court of Appeals seat (with 13 candidates). The Court of Appeals race is believed to be the first time IRV has been used in any statewide general election in the United States.\n\nThe statewide IRV law was repealed by the General Assembly in 2013 as part of a sweeping voter ID bill, meaning that special judicial elections with more than two candidates would once again be decided by a simple plurality.\nIn the United States, IRV election laws were first adopted in 1912. Five states (Florida, Indiana, Maryland, Minnesota, and Wisconsin) used versions of IRV for party primaries, typically with each voter having two rankings and candidates needing to finish in the top two to advance to the instant runoff. By 1930 each jurisdiction had replaced IRV.\n\nAfter voting to authorize its use, the Republican Party of Utah used instant runoff voting in 2002, 2003 and 2004 at its statewide convention, including in a contested race to nominate a governor in 2004. In 2005, Republicans used repeated balloting for its statewide convention and has done so in subsequent years. Some county Republican parties like Cache County continue to use instant runoff voting at their conventions, and IRV was used by Republicans to fill several state legislative vacancies in 2009-2011.\n\nIn 2014, the Democratic Party of Arlington, Virginia used IRV in two \"firehouse primaries\" for countywide office that each drew several thousand voters, and it joined with the Democratic Party of Fairfax county that year to use IRV in a seven-candidate primary election for a special election for the House of Delegates. Arlington Democrats also used the system in 2016.\n\nIRV was also used in 2014 by leaders of the Henrico County Democrats in a three-candidate special election nomination contest for the House of Delegates in December 2014 \n\nIn May 2009, the Democratic Party of Charlottesville, Virginia, held its first \"open caucus\" to select its nominees for city council and sheriff, using instant runoff voting. Voter turnout was close 1,600 voters. There were two incumbents and one challenger running for two nominations in the city council race. One incumbent was renominated and another defeated without the need for an instant runoff. Three candidates ran in the sheriff's race. No candidate won an initial majority. In the instant runoff, James E. Brown III defeated Mike Baird.\n\nIn August 2011, the Party again used to nominate candidates. Voter turnout rose to 2,582 in the city council race for three nominations. Two candidates were nominated with a majority of the first round vote. The final nomination was determined by IRV.\n\nIn part to increase awareness of the voting method and to demonstrate it in a real-world situation, the Independence Party of Minnesota tested IRV by using it in a straw poll during the 2004 Minnesota caucuses.\n\nThe poll allowed a none of the above option which could not be eliminated. Their rules eliminated one weakest candidate at a time, or all candidates in a tie at the bottom. They continued the elimination until only one candidate remained to confirm that this candidate had more support than NOTA.\n\nThis summary table shows the first round, and final five rounds, excluding five rounds during which 18 weak candidates were eliminated.\n\nThe city of Berkeley, California passed (72%) instant runoff voting in 2005 to use RCV to elect the mayor, auditor and city council. The city used IRV for the first time in November 2010 for elections for four city council seats and the city auditor. Berkeley used IRV for electing its mayor and four city council seats in November 2012. The city continues to use IRV, including in city elections in November 2014 and November 2016.\n\nThe city of Oakland, California, passed (69%) a measure in November 2006 to adopt IRV for 18 city offices. In November 2010, Oakland used IRV to elect its mayor, three city council races and four other local offices, with elections for mayor and council district four requiring multiple rounds of counting. It used IRV in the city's remaining elected offices in 2012. IRV was again used in 2014 and 2016, including in the 2014 mayoral election in which incumbent Jean Quan was defeated by Libby Schaaf.\n\nOakland's 2010 mayoral election was an open-seat election in which no candidate earned more than 34% of votes in the first round. In the tally, candidates were eliminated sequentially, with three candidates far ahead in first choices. After the count of first choices, Don Perata was in first place, Jean Quan in second place, and Rebecca Kaplan in third place. They remained in that order of votes after all other candidates were eliminated and their votes re-allocated. When Kaplan was then eliminated, Quan picked up 18,864 votes from Kaplan backers while Perata was the next choice of only 6,407 Kaplan backers. As a result, Quan won a final round majority when matched against Perata, which means she was ranked ahead of Perata on a majority of ballots in which one of them received a ranking.(11% of voters did not rank either of them, making their votes \"exhausted\" by the time of the final round.)\n\nOakland used IRV for several elections in 2012, including a citywide election for city attorney and for several seats on the city council and school board. Several races were decided in an instant runoff, including the District 3 city council race where the winner trailed in first choices. Of the 18 Oakland offices elected by IRV in 2010 and 2012, sixteen of the IRV winners received more votes than the previous winner had won before adoption in the last non-IRV election \n\nSan Francisco has used IRV for its Board of Supervisors and most citywide offices nearly every November since 2004. In March 2002, an initiative backed by a broad coalition of civic organizations won 55% of the vote to adopt instant runoff voting. This implementation allows the voter to rank three candidates and uses sequential candidate elimination until one candidate earns a majority of votes cast for remaining candidates. A unanimous panel of the US Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit has upheld San Francisco's IRV law as constitutional.\n\nIRV was first used in October 2004 for YouthVOTE, an election held throughout San Francisco's public schools which elected the San Francisco school board's student delegate; after that, it was used in the November 2004 supervisoral races and every November since that time for at least one election in the city. IRV has played a decisive role in at least one city election in 2004, 2005, 2006, 2008, 2010, 2011, 2012 and 2014. Exit polls by San Francisco State University have shown support for the new system from all groupings of voters.\n\nThe San Francisco Department of Elections prefers the term Ranked Choice Voting (RCV) because \"the word 'instant' might create an expectation that final results will be available \"immediately\" after the polls close on election night.\" The department releases first choice totals immediately, but used to wait until more absentee ballots have arrived before running instant runoff ballot counts. That practice has since changed.\n\nSan Francisco continues to hold IRV elections as of 2017, several of which have gone to multiple rounds of counting. In 2010, for example, two candidates won who were not the leaders in first choice rankings. In 2011, all three citywide elections up for election - mayor, sheriff and district attorney—were decided in IRV tallies. In the wake of the November 2012 elections, sixteen of eighteen offices elected by IRV were held by people of color.\n\nElection results for 2004, 2005, and 2006 are provided in greater detail below.\n\nThere were four elections that used the instant runoff process after no majority winner in the first round: Districts 1,5,7, and 11.\n\nThe District 5 results are included below as the largest election from 2004 and most round of counting. The elimination table shows the candidates reordered by their elimination. The elimination process was stable for the highest 5 candidates, holding their same plurality ranking each round despite the 19 rounds of elimination and transfer votes.\n\nThe IRV elimination process was halted when candidate Mirkarimi reached more than 50% of the active ballots, but only 37.6% of the total first-round ballots. This stopping point is pragmatic for picking a winner, but fails to show how many votes the winner had compared to only the strongest runner up candidate.\n\nNotes:\n\nThere was one election requiring the instant runoff process to be performed, with 4 candidates and finding a 55% majority winner in two rounds.\nThere were two elections that required the instant runoff process, districts 4 and 6:\n\nThe detailed runoff results for district 4 are:\nIn November 2000, the voters of San Leandro, California approved a charter amendment by 63% to 37% requiring use of a two-round runoff or IRV if no candidate won a majority of first round votes. In January 2010, the city council voted 5-2 to use IRV for its elections for mayor and three city council seats in November 2010. The mayor's race required multiple rounds of counting. Challenger Stephen H. Cassidy narrowly defeated incumbent Mayor Tony Santos in the final vote by a 50.57% to 49.43% margin. \n\nIn November 2012, San Leandro held IRV elections for three city council seats. One election was decided in first choices, and two with an instant runoff. In November 2014 and November 2016, San Leandro used IRV for electing six city council seats and the mayor.\n\nThe November 2018 elections will use IRV for the mayor and three council seats.\n\nAspen, Colorado passed IRV in November 2007 for the mayoral race and for at-large council races with two winners. In March 2009, the Aspen council adopted a unique variation of IRV for the council races. A block voting tally based on the first and second rank choices was used to determine first round support. Any candidate with initial majority support was elected. If there were not two first-round winners, there was a batch elimination of low-placing candidates to reduce the number of continuing candidates before the instant runoff. In the latter case, separate IRV runoffs would be conducted for each council seat, with the winner of the first seat eliminated from the race for the second seat.\n\nAspen's first elections with IRV and the new city council system were on May 5, 2009. The number of voters was the highest in the history of Aspen elections. Mick Ireland was re-elected as mayor in the fourth round of a four-candidate race. Both city council incumbents were defeated in the two-seat IRV election in which nine candidates participated. The winners were selected after IRV tallies. 168 spoiled ballots were recast by voters alerted to errors by their optical scanning machine. The city reported 0% invalid ballots in the mayor's race and 0.9% invalid ballots in the two-seat city council elections.\n\nThe elections were close, and some Aspen observers argued that a traditional runoff system would have given more time to consider their top choices. There also was debate over how to implement audit procedures. In 2009 voters rejected an advisory measure to maintain IRV and in 2010 approved a binding amendment to return to a traditional runoff system.\n\nThe city of Basalt, Colorado adopted instant runoff voting in 2002 for mayoral elections in which there are at least three candidates. The city is ready to run instant runoff elections, but the elections in 2004, 2008, 2012 and 2016 did not have more than two candidates file for the mayor's office.\n\nOn November 4, 2008, voters in the town of Telluride, Colorado, passed an ordinance with 67% of the vote to adopt IRV for the next three mayoral elections, starting in November 2011 if three candidates file for the office. The system was used for the city's 2011 mayoral election. The incumbent mayor Stu Fraser was re-elected by securing a majority of first choices. In the 2015 mayoral election, Sean Murphy handily won an open seat election for mayor after trailing in first choices.\nThe city of Sarasota, Florida passed IRV (78%) in November 2007. While initially precluded from implementation by the lack of compatible voting machines, in 2015 new, compatible machines were purchased by the Sarasota County Supervisor of Elections. Implementation now hinges on the adoption of certification criteria for ranked choice voting tabulation equipment by the Florida Department of State's Division of Elections.\nIn November 2010, voters in Portland, Maine, adopted a charter amendment with 52% to establish a directly elected mayor, using instant runoff voting. The first election was in November 2011. Fifteen candidates ran. The winner Michael Brennan led with 27% of first choices and won decisively in the final instant runoff voting.\n\nIn November 2015, Brennan ran for re-election against two opponents and was defeated by Ethan Strimling. 'While Strimling won a majority of votes in the first round, the Green Party affiliated candidate was able to run a serious campaign without any fingers pointing to him as a \"spoiler\"', \"fairvote.org\" opined.\nThe city of Takoma Park, Maryland adopted instant runoff voting for city council and mayoral elections in 2006 after voters approved it with 84% support in November 2005.\n\nIn January 2007 the first IRV election was held to fill a city council vacancy in a three-way race with a majority winner in the first round. Voters selected Reuben Snipper with 107 votes (52.7%), defeating Eric Hensal with 72 votes (35.5%) and Alexandra Quéré Barrionuevo with 23 votes (11.3%) and one write-in. Snipper said the possibility of using the IRV system changed the race's dynamics. \"I had every reason to believe this was going to be a close race,\" he said. \"It meant that when I knocked on a door, if a person indicated they were going to vote for another candidate, I didn't just leave right away. I tried to persuade them I would be a good second choice.\"\n\nIn November 2007 the mayor ran unopposed, and, out of six ward seats on the ballot, one was contested. Runoff provisions were not exercised. In November 2009, the mayor and one city councilor each faced one opponent. In November 2011, one city council race drew three candidates; it was won by a candidate securing a majority of first choices.\n\nIn July 2012, the Ward Five race again was vacant. In another three-way race, first-time candidate Jarrett Smith was elected. After securing 44% of first choices, Smith won a majority in the instant runoff against Eric Hensal.\n\nIRV was used in regularly scheduled city elections in 2013, 2015 and 2017, along with a special election that required two rounds of counting.\n\nCambridge, Massachusetts has been using IRV for city council and school board since 1940. It is the only location in the US that uses the multi-member version of IRV, also known as single transferable vote, which allows for more proportional representation. Six other Massachusetts towns were using the system by 1947, but all except Cambridge abandoned it due to concerns about Communists being elected. Amherst, Massachusetts adopted IRV in 2018.\n\nIRV (called preferential voting or PV) was adopted for mayoral races in Ann Arbor, Michigan in 1974 after a successful ballot initiative sponsored by the local Human Rights Party. IRV was used in the 1975 mayoral election. Democratic Party nominee Albert H. Wheeler, the city's first African-American mayor, won after trailing the Republican incumbent 49% to 40% in the first round of counting, with remaining votes cast for the Human Rights Party nominee.\n\nIn April 1976, 62% of voters voted to repeal IRV in a special election.\n\nThe city of Ferndale, Michigan passed (68%) instant runoff voting in 2004, however the system has not been implemented.\nAs of October 2018, three cities in Minnesota use IRV.\n\nThe city of Minneapolis, Minnesota, passed (65%) instant runoff voting in November 2006. Although a citizen group filed a lawsuit in 2007 challenging the constitutionality of the system and to block its implementation, the lawsuit was dismissed in a ruling on January 13, 2009. The Minnesota Supreme Court unanimously upheld this ruling in an opinion on June 11, 2009.\n\nOn November 3, 2009, the City used instant runoff voting, now commonly known in Minneapolis as ranked choice voting, to elect the mayor, 13 city council seats and seven other local offices and used a multi-seat variation of IRV, the single transferable vote, for park board elections. In November 2013, it again used IRV for those same elections, including in the open seat Minneapolis mayoral election, 2013\n\nOn November 4, 2009, voters in the city of Saint Paul, Minnesota, passed a charter amendment with 52% of the vote to adopt IRV for future elections for mayor and city council. In February 2011, the city council adopted rules governing the November 2011 elections. IRV elections took place for city council races, with two council races requiring multiple rounds of counting.\n\nIRV was used in St. Paul's 2013 election for mayor and in an open seat election for city council. IRV also was used for city council elections in 2015, including one election decided in an instant runoff.\n\nOn March 4, 2008, the city of Santa Fe, New Mexico, passed a referendum for IRV (called Ranked Choice voting) by a vote of 5659 to 3044 (65% for). Ranked choice voting was authorized to begin with the regular municipal election in March 2010 or as soon as equipment was available at a reasonable price. Responding to a petition to force the city to implement RCV, the New Mexico Supreme Court ordered RCV to be used in municipal elections, beginning with the March 6, 2018, races for mayor and city council.\n\nFollowing successful implementation of RCV in Santa Fe, the city council of Las Cruces, New Mexico voted in June 2018 to adopt RCV, beginning with the November 2019 municipal elections.\n\nA 2006 law established that IRV would be used when judicial vacancies were created between a primary election and sixty days before a general election. In The law also established a pilot program for instant runoff voting in the form of batch-elimination IRV for up to 10 cities in 2007 and up to 10 counties for 2008; to be monitored and reported to the 2007-2008 General Assembly. In November 2010, North Carolina had three IRV elections for local-level superior court judges, each with three candidates, and a statewide IRV election for a North Carolina Court of Appeals seat (with 13 candidates). The Court of Appeals race is believed to be the first time IRV has been used in any statewide general election in the United States.\n\nSeveral municipalities considered participating in the IRV pilot in 2007. Cary, Hendersonville and Kinston voted to participate; Kinston dropped out because there were not enough candidates running to use IRV. Other cities declined to participate in the pilot. No NC counties volunteered to pilot IRV in 2008 elections held in conjunction with state and federal races. In August 2008 the governor signed legislation extending the pilot program for local elections to be held in 2009-2011.\n\nThere was much debate whether IRV was successful when it was used. This debate continued in the North Carolina legislature when it debated legislation to extend the pilot program. Some verified voting advocates contended that the IRV tabulation procedures used were not legal. Both advocates and opponents of the provision supported amendments to the pilot program to: ensure that the local governing body of any jurisdiction participating in the pilot must approve their participation; the jurisdiction must develop and implement voter education plans; and the UNC School of Government by January 2009 must approve procedures for conducting IRV elections. After these amendments were adopted, the state House of Representatives, by a majority of 65-47, rejected an amendment designed to remove the pilot program from the legislation, and the legislation ultimately won approval by both houses.\n\nIn 2009 Hendersonville again used IRV, while the Cary Town Council voted to use a traditional runoff method. Three candidates ran for mayor in Hendersonville in November 2009; five candidates ran for two seats on the city council using a multi-seat version of IRV. All seats were filled based on first choices without the need for instant runoffs.\n\nIn 2011, Hendersonville's city council unanimously voted to use IRV a third time, although ultimately not enough candidates filed for office to trigger the need for the system.\n\nThe IRV pilot program was repealed by the General Assembly in 2013 as part of a sweeping \"voter ID\" bill, meaning that special judicial elections with more than two candidates would once again be decided by a simple plurality.\n\nIn October 2007 the city of Cary, North Carolina used batch-elimination IRV for municipal election for three council seats and for mayor. The mayor's race (with two candidates) and two of the council seats (with four and three candidates on the ballot) were won with a majority in the first round. The remaining council seat, with three candidates, went to a second round of counting under the instant runoff system; the plurality winner in the first round went on to win with 50.9% of the final round vote, amounting to 46.4% of first-round ballots cast, with 8.9% of the ballots offering no preference between the top two candidates.\n\nCary used hand or machine-marked paper ballots that are read on optical scanners manufactured by ES&S. First column choices were tallied at the precinct. The second and third column choices were counted at a central location.\nOn November 8, 2016, voters in Benton County, Oregon, passed a charter amendment with 54.3% of the vote to enact IRV for county elections. The first use of IRV will take place in November 2020, after the state legislature in 2018 appropriated funds to enable the county to administer the elections.\nOn November 4, 2008, voters in the city of Memphis, Tennessee, passed a charter amendment with 71% of the vote to enact IRV for city elections. The first use of IRV has been dependent on the city's ability to administer the election: it is scheduled for 2019, however, the city council voted in 2017 to place a referendum to repeal IRV on the 2018 ballot. \n\nIn 2018, Utah passed a law allowing municipalities to opt in to IRV voting starting with 2019 municipal elections.\n\nThe city of Burlington, Vermont approved IRV for use in mayoral elections with a 64% vote in 2005. The 2006 Burlington mayoral race was decided after two rounds of IRV tallying, and the mayoral race in 2009 was decided in three rounds. Unlike Burlington's first IRV mayoral election in 2006, the IRV winner in 2009 (VT Progressive candidate Bob Kiss) was neither the same as the plurality winner (Republican candidate Kurt Wright) nor the Condorcet winner (Democratic candidate Andy Montroll).\n\nThe results caused a post-election controversy regarding the IRV method. In late 2009, a group of several Democrats (who supported Republican Kurt Wright) led a signature drive to force a referendum on IRV. According a local columnist, the vote was a referendum on Mayor Kiss, who was a \"lame duck\" because of a scandal relating to Burlington Telecom and other local issues. However, in an interview with Vermont Public Radio, Mayor Kiss disputed that claim. IRV was repealed in March 2010 by a vote of 52% to 48%.\n\nThe repeal reverted the system back to a 40% rule that requires a top-two runoff if no candidate exceeds 40% of the vote. Had the 2009 election occurred under these rules, Kiss and Wright would have advanced to the runoff. If the same voters had participated in the runoff as in the first election and not changed their preferences, Kiss would have won the runoff. In 2011, an initiative effort to increase the winning threshold from the 40% plurality to a 50% majority failed.\n\nPierce County, Washington, passed (53%) instant runoff voting in November 2006 for most of its county offices. Voters upheld the 2008 implementation timing with a vote of 67% in 2007 and made minor adjustments to the charter language involving ballot access and numbers of rankings. Seven instant runoff voting elections took place on November 4, 2008 and one on November 3, 2009. The introduction of IRV was marked by controversies about costs and a Supreme Court ruling that restored Washington State's top two election system passed statewide in 2004, but struck down by courts in 2005. On November 3, 2009, voters repealed IRV.\nSeveral states jurisdictions that hold runoff elections allow certain categories of absentee voters to submit IRV ballots, because the interval between votes is too short for a second round of absentee voting. IRV ballots enable long-distance absentee votes to count in the second (general) election round if their first choice does not make the runoff. Alabama, Arkansas, Mississippi, Louisiana and South Carolina used IRV ballots for overseas voters in 2014 and in 2016. A city using this practice is Springfield, Illinois after voters approved it with 91%. Louisiana uses it also for out-of-state members of the United States military and others who reside overseas.\nBetween 1912 and 1930, limited forms of IRV (typically with only two rankings) were implemented and subsequently repealed in the states of Florida, Indiana, Maryland, Minnesota, and Wisconsin. In the 1970s, it was implemented and repealed in Ann Arbor, Michigan. More recently, it was adopted and repealed in Pierce County, Washington (2006-2009); Burlington, Vermont (2005-2010); and Aspen, Colorado (2007-2010); and in North Carolina, which allowed its use in elections between 2006 and 2013. \n\nAccording to FairVote, an organization advocating IRV, dozens of states have entertained instant runoff voting legislation since 2000. In 2008, Republican Vermont governor Jim Douglas vetoed legislation which would have established instant runoff voting for that state's congressional elections starting that year despite testimony in support by Vermont's independent U.S. Senator Bernie Sanders and its Democratic U.S. House Member Peter Welch. In 2003, an amendment to the California State Constitution was proposed with wide-ranging goals of election reform, including instant runoff voting for statewide offices. In the state of Washington, an initiative seeking to adopt instant runoff voting in 2005 failed to garner enough signatures. The city of Vancouver, Washington voted in 1999 to adopt instant runoff voting and the state legislature enacted enabling legislation in 2004, but the city in 2006 chose not to exercise its option. Instant runoff voting for all state and federal elections was on Alaska's statewide ballot in August 2002, when it was defeated. It also was defeated by voters in Glendale, Arizona, in 2008, in Fort Collins, Colorado in 2011, and in Duluth, Minnesota in 2015.\nIn the U.S. Congress, the Voter Choice Act of 2005 sought to require the use of instant runoff voting for general elections for federal office.\n\n"}

The launching of the new party occurred two months after the alliance between Singh and the Samajwadi Party broke down. Upon the founding of the party, Singh handed over the leadership of the party to his son Rajveer Singh, who was named national president.\n\nSecond time, citing neglect and humiliation in the party, the former Chief Minister and national Vice President of the BJP Kalyan Singh resigned from his post and the primary membership of the party on Tuesday, 20 January 2009. Next day after meeting Samajwadi Party leaders Mulayam Singh Yadav and Amar Singh, Kalyan Singh announced that he would campaign for the SP in the 2009 Lok Sabha polls. Meanwhile his son Rajveer Singh, one of the main reasons of his disenchantment with the BJP, joined the Samajwadi Party.\n\nOn 14 November 2009, Mulayam Singh Yadav said that the poor performance of the party at the Firozabad Lok Sabha by-election was due to the loss of Muslim support because of Kalyan Singh. Snubbed by Mulayam Singh Yadav, former Uttar Pradesh chief minister Kalyan Singh on 15 November 2009, Kalyan Singh reaffirmed his allegiance to the BJP and the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh and indicated he was willing to rejoin BJP while his son Rajbir Singh resigned from SP.\n\nIn January 2010, he announced the formation of a new Hindutva-oriented political party, the Jan Kranti Party, but chose to take the role of patron while his son became the leader.\n\nIn January 2010, Kalyan Singh announced the formation of a new Hindutva-oriented political party, the Jan Kranti Party, but chose to take the role of patron while his son became the leader.\n\nAt the time of the founding of the new party, Kalyan Singh declared that the intention of the party is to contest all 403 constituencies in the 2012 Uttar Pradesh Legislative Assembly election.\n\nOn 21 January 2013 Kalyan Singh announced the merger of his both formed parties, Rashtriya Kranti Party (RKP)which he formed after get suspended from BJP in 1999 and also merger of his later founded party in 2010, Jan Kranti Party (JKP) with his former parental party, Bhartiya Janta Party during the Atal Shankhnaad Rally of BJP in Lucknow's Jhulelal Park. While former chief minister Kalyan Singh chose not to \"officially join the BJP\" on the advice of senior party leaders. The reason for this was that BJP leaders do not want Kalyan Singh, a Lok Sabha member from Etah elected in 2009 parliamentary election, should resign from parliament. With an arrangement for over 8,000 at the rally, the BJP state leadership had been claiming that 50,000 people would be present, excluding 12,000 RKP workers, who too had joined the BJP along with their leader Rajveer Singh.\n"}

Any distinction amongst diplomatic envoys sent from the Imperial Japanese court or from any of the Japanese shogunates was lost or rendered moot when the ambassador was received in the Chinese capital.\n\nExtant records document missions to China between the years of 607 and 839 (a mission planned for 894 was cancelled). The composition of these Imperial missions included members of the aristocratic \"kuge\" and Buddhist priests. These missions led to the importation of Chinese culture, including advances in the sciences and technology. These diplomatic encounters produced the beginnings of a range of Schools of Buddhism in Japan, including Zen.\n\nFrom the sinocentric perspective of the Chinese Court in Chang'an, the several embassies sent from Kyoto were construed as tributaries of Imperial China; but it is not clear that the Japanese shared this view.\n\nChina seems to have taken the initiative in opening relations with Japan. Sui Emperor Yangdi dispatched a message in 605 which read:\n\nThe sovereign of Sui respectfully inquires about the sovereign of Wa.\n\nThe court of Empress Suiko responded by sponsoring a mission led by Ono no Imoko in 607. A message carried by that mission, believed to have been written by Prince Shōtoku, contains the earliest known written instance in which the Japanese archipelago is referred to by a term meaning \"land of the rising sun.\" The salutation read, in part:\n\nFrom the sovereign of the land of the rising sun (\"hi izuru tokoro\") to the sovereign of the land of the setting sun.\"\n\nThe included representatives sent to study government and technology.\n\nThe are the best known; 19 missions were completed. A 20th mission had been planned for 894 (\"Kanpyō 6, 8th month\"), including the appointment of ambassadors. However, shortly before departure, the mission was halted by Emperor Uda because of reports of unsettled conditions in China. The emperor's decision-making was influenced by the persuasive counsel of Sugawara no Michizane.\n\nJapanese envoys to the Sui court were received as ambassadors:\n\n\nJapanese envoys to the Tang court were received as ambassadors:\nThree missions to the Tang court were dispatched during the reign of Emperor Kōtoku.\nEmperor Kanmu's planned mission to the Tang court in 804 (\"Enryaku 23\") included three ambassadors and several Buddhist priests, including and ; but the enterprise was delayed until the end of the year. The ambassadors returned in the middle of 805 (\"Enryaku 24, 6th month\"). They were accompanied by the monk Saichō, also known by his posthumous name , whose teachings would develop into the Tendai school of Japanese Buddhism. In 806 (\"Daidō 1, 8th month\"), the return of the monk Kūkai, also known posthumously as , marks the beginning of what would develop into the Shingon school of Japanese Buddhism.\n\nNew ambassadors to China were appointed by Emperor Ninmyō in 834, but the mission was put off. \n\nIn China, a steady and conservative Confucianist Song dynasty emerged after the end of the Tang dynasty and subsequent period of disunity during the Five Dynasties and Ten Kingdoms period. During this time, although travel to China was generally safe, Japanese rulers believed there was little to learn from the Song, and so there were no major embassy missions to China.\n\nAncient Japan was called Wa, which had a primitive culture when compared to Tang culture. The Tang folks referred to Wa as 東夷 (Eastern barbarians).\n\nFrom 630 onward, Wa sent large groups of monks, students and government officials, up to 600 each time, to the Tang capital of Chang'an to learn the then advanced production technology, social system, history, philosophy, arts and architecture.\nAmong many items adopted by Wa:\n\n\nJapanese envoys to the Ming court were received as ambassadors.\n\n\nDuring Japan's self-imposed isolation in the Edo period (1603–1868), Japan's vicarious relationships with China evolved through the intermediary of the Kingdom of Ryukyu. Japan's view of external relations was ambivalent.\n\n\n\n\n"}

There were the heads of the original Hebrew tribes, and then also prophets such as Moses, Jeremiah and Samuel and whose words inspire people to this day, judges such as Samson, kings such as David and Solomon, priests of the Temple in Jerusalem, and the Sanhedrin which was the judiciary.\n\nWith the demise of ancient kingdoms of Israel and Judah and coinciding with the revolt of the Maccabees against ancient Greece and later Jewish-Roman wars, the sages of the Mishnah and subsequently the Talmud, referred to as the Oral Law in Judaism, took on a growing and central leadership role. After the destruction of the Second Temple and the subsequent exile for almost two thousand years, the Jews scattered throughout the world turned to their most learned rabbis for local leadership and council.\n\nDuring Bar Kokhba's revolt against Roman Empire (132-135), the supreme religious authority Rabbi Akiva sanctioned Simon bar Kokhba to be a war leader, whereas during the 2nd century Judah haNasi was not only the supreme temporal leader sanctioned by Rome, but also edited the original work of the Mishnah which became the \"de facto constitution\" of the world's Jewry. The final editions of the Talmud became the core curriculum of the majority of Jews.\n\nIn Babylonia the Exilarch was almost always a rabbinical personality. The Geonim such as Saadia Gaon (892-942) were not only great sages but also political guides. The writings and rulings of those such as Rashi (1040–1105), Maimonides (1135–1204), Yosef Karo (1488–1575) who published the most widely accepted code of Jewish law the Shulkhan Arukh, Isaac Luria (1534–1572), the Vilna Gaon (1720–1797), the Chafetz Chaim (1838–1933) and many others have shaped Jewish law for almost two thousand years, as their religious rulings were published, distributed, studied, and observed until the present time.\n\nThe loose collection of learned rabbis that governed the dispersed Jewish community held sway for a long time. Great parts of Central Europe accepted the leadership of the rabbinical Council of Four Lands from the 16th to the late 18th centuries. In the Eastern Europe, in spite of the rivalry between the schools of thought of the Vilna Gaon (or the GRA, Rabbi Elijah ben Solomon, 1720–1797) of the Mitnagdim, who spoke against Hasidic Judaism and Baal Shem Tov (Rabbi Israel ben Eliezer, 1700–1760), the founder of Hasidic Judaism, rabbis were regarded as the final arbiters of community decisions. Tens of thousands of Responsa and many works were published and studied wherever Jews lived in organized communities. In Western Europe, especially in monarchies, where no equal rights were granted for the Jewish population, radical Maskilim defined the new role of religion as an education of just citizens — like Moses Mendelssohn in his book \"Jerusalem or On Religious Power and Judaism\" which was a response to the Prussian reformer Christian Wilhelm von Dohm. The radical tendency of the pedagogic movement went so far, that Mendelssohn's student David Friedländer identified Judaism with the seclusion of modern European culture and secular Judaism could end up in conversion to the religion of the unsecularized state. In contradiction to his teacher early modern leadership turned out to be misled leadership, whose followers ended up as \"Jewish citizens without any conscience\".\n\nWith the growth of the Renaissance and the development of the secular modern world, and as Jews were welcomed into non-Jewish society particularly during the times of Napoleon in the 18th and 19th centuries, Jews began to leave the Jewish ghettos in Europe, and simultaneously rejected the traditional roles of the rabbis as communal and religious leaders. New leaders such as Israel Jacobson, father of the German Reform Judaism movement, launched an egalitarian, modernist stance that challenged the Orthodoxy. The resulting fractures in Jewish society has translated into a situation whereby there is no single religious governing body for the entire Jewish community at the present time.\n\nIn individual religious congregations or synagogues, the spiritual leader is generally the rabbi. Rabbis are expected to be taught in both the Talmud and the \"Shulkhan Arukh\" (Code of Jewish Law) as well as many other classical texts of Jewish scholarship. Rabbis go through formal training in Rabbinical texts and responsa, either at a yeshiva or similar institution. \"Rabbi\" is not a universal term however, as many Sephardic rabbinic Jewish communities refer to their leaders as \"hakham\" (\"wise man\"). Among Yemenite Jews, known as \"Teimanim\", the term \"mori\" (\"my teacher\") is used. Each religious tradition has its own qualifications for rabbis; for more information, see Semicha (\"ordination\"). In addition to the rabbi, most synagogues have a \"hazzan\" (cantor) who leads many parts of the prayer service.\n\nIn Israel the office of Chief Rabbi has always been very influential. Various Orthodox movements, such as Agudath Israel of America and the Shas party in Israel strictly follow the rulings of their Rosh yeshivas who are often famous Talmud scholars. The last Rebbe of Lubavitch, Rabbi Menachem Mendel Schneerson, the late Rabbi Elazar Menachem Shach, and Rabbi Ovadia Yosef in Israel are examples of powerful contemporary Haredi rabbis. The Haredi Agudah movements receive and follow the policy guidelines of their own \"Council of Torah Sages\". In the Hassidic movements, leadership is usually hereditary.\n\nIn both the Reform and Conservative of Judaism, rabbis are often trained at religious universities, such as the Jewish Theological Seminary in New York City for the Conservative movement, Hebrew Union College for the American Reform movement, and Leo Baeck College for the UK Liberal and Reform Movements. The Reform, Conservative, and Reconstructionist traditions each have their own governing group or individual leaders. Membership in these governing groups are selected by representatives of the Jewish community they serve, with Jewish scholarship considered to be the key factors for determining leaders. These governing bodies make decisions on the nature of religious practice within their tradition, as well as ordaining and assigning rabbis and other religious leaders.\n\nThe Union of Reform Judaism (URJ), the synagogue arm of the Reform Movement in North America, is governed by a 253-member Board of Trustees in close partnership with URJ Chair Daryl Messinger, URJ President Rabbi Rick Jacobs, and the senior leadership team. Delegates from URJ congregations meet once every two years for the URJ General Assembly to pass resolutions that guide the organization’s future direction. \n\nThe body of Conservative rabbis is the Rabbinical Assembly, which maintains a Committee on Jewish Law and Standards. The body of Reform rabbis is the Central Conference of American Rabbis.\n\nFollowing the Renaissance and the Enlightenment in Europe (with its Jewish \"extension\" the Haskalah movement, which led to much modern-day assimilation into the cultures of their native countries), the variety of Jewish practice grew, with a widespread adoption of secular values and life-styles. Many modern Jewish communities are served by a variety of secular organizations at the local, national, and international levels. These organizations have no official role in religious life, but often play an important part in the Jewish community. Most of the largest groups, such as Hadassah and the United Jewish Communities, have an elected leadership. No one secular group represents the entire Jewish community, and there is often significant internal debate among Jews about the stances these organizations take on affairs dealing with the Jewish community as a whole, such as antisemitism and Israeli policies.\n\nIn the United States and Canada today, the mainly secular United Jewish Communities (UJC), formerly known as the United Jewish Appeal (UJA), represents over 150 Jewish Federations and 400 independent communities across North America. Every major American city has its local \"Jewish Federation\", and many have sophisticated community centers and provide services, mainly health care-related. They raise record sums of money for philanthropic and humanitarian causes in North America and Israel. Additional local organizations include Jewish Family Services, Jewish nursing homes and Jewish community foundations. Other organizations such as the Anti-Defamation League, American Jewish Congress, American Jewish Committee, and the B'nai B'rith represent different segments of the American Jewish community on a variety of issues.\n\nA Karaite synagogue is run by a board of directors, and its spiritual leader is often called a \"Hakham\", the equivalent of a \"rabbi\", and matches one in function. The \"Gabbai\" is the treasurer, the \"Shammash\" is the custodian, the \"Hazzan\" leads prayers, and in some the \"Ba'al Qeri'ah\" leads in the reading of the Torah. In America, Karaites are represented by \"the Karaite Jews of America\", and in Israel they are represented.\n\n"}

Davis\n\nJohn Preston Davis (January 19, 1905 – September 11, 1973) was an American journalist, lawyer and activist intellectual, who became prominent for his work with the Joint Committee on National Recovery. He co-founded the National Negro Congress in 1935, which was affiliated with the Communist Party of America.\n\nHe founded \"Our World\" magazine in 1946, a full-size, nationally distributed magazine edited for African-American readers. He also published the \"American Negro Reference Book,\" covering virtually every aspect of African-American life, present and past.\n\nJohn P. Davis was born in Washington, D.C., the son of Dr. William Henry Davis and Julia Davis. His father was a graduate of Howard University and served as principal of Armstrong High School. During World War I, Dr. Davis was appointed as Secretary to Dr. Emmett Jay Scott, Special Assistant to the United States Secretary of War. In the 1920s, Dr. Davis served as Secretary to the Presidential Commission investigating the economic conditions in the Virgin Islands.\n\nDavis attended segregated schools in Washington, D.C., graduating from the elite Dunbar High School, which stressed an academic curriculum. In 1922 he enrolled in Bates College in Lewiston, Maine. He graduated in 1926, earning an A.B. and double honors in English and Psychology. At Bates, Davis was president of Delta Sigma Rho, an honorary debating fraternity, and editor of the student publication \"The Bobcat\".\n\nDavis toured Europe with the Bates College debating team. He was among the first African-American men to be sent overseas under the auspices of the American University Union to engage in international debate; his team from Bates met and defeated Cambridge University. While he was an undergraduate at Bates College, Davis was nominated for a Rhodes scholarship. He contributed short stories to the magazines, \"The Crisis\" and \"Opportunity,\" published by the NAACP.\nWith his literary interests, Davis was drawn into the Harlem Renaissance. After college, he moved to New York City, where for a time, he replaced the celebrated scholar W. E. B. Du Bois as literary editor of \"The Crisis\". During this period, Davis joined with other young black writers – Zora Neale Hurston, Langston Hughes, Gwendolyn Bennett, Wallace Thurman, Aaron Douglas, Richard Bruce – to produce \"Fire!!\", a magazine devoted to young African-American artists.\n\nDavis had a fellowship to Harvard University from 1926 to 1927, and earned his master's degree in Journalism. He left Harvard to join the staff of Fisk University, a historically black college in Nashville, where he served as Director of Publicity from (1927 to 1928). He returned to Harvard University and earned an LLB degree from Harvard Law School in 1933.\n\nAt Harvard, Davis cemented lifelong friendships with a small core of black students, including fellow Dunbar High School alumni Robert C. Weaver, later appointed as the first black member of a Presidential cabinet; William Hastie, later appointed as the first black federal judge; and Ralph Bunche, later a statesman and diplomat who was awarded a Nobel Prize for Peace.\n\nThese friends remained important throughout his career. During their student years, the men discussed race and politics, especially the inadequacy of the black Republican leadership. When the Great Depression intensified the social and economic problems confronting black America, Davis and his colleagues looked to the example of Reconstruction, when federal power was used to redress the plight of former slaves. They called on the federal government to ensure black civil and political rights. The New Deal of Franklin D. Roosevelt seemed to offer the possibility of federal intervention for economic justice.\n\nDavis married Marguerite DeMond, the daughter of Reverend Abraham Lincoln DeMond and Lula Watkins (Patterson) DeMond. She had attended Avery Normal Institute in Charleston, South Carolina, operated by the American Missionary Association and the Congregationalist Church. Even before the Civil War, Avery Normal Institute's racially integrated faculty was providing quality educations for African Americans. She attended Syracuse University in 1931 and came to Washington, D.C., with her mother in 1932, after the death of her father.\n\nMarguerite DeMond went to work as a researcher for African-American historian Carter G. Woodson's Association for the Study of African American Life and History. After a one-year courtship, she and Davis were married. They had four children, including Michael DeMond Davis, who became a journalist who authored Black American Women in Olympic track and Field and the Thurgood Marshall biography.\n\nIn the summer of 1933 John P. Davis, a law graduate, and Robert C. Weaver, a doctoral student at Harvard, acted to ensure that African-American interests were represented in government programs. The two men returned to Washington, D.C. and established an office on Capitol Hill, where they fought successfully against the racial wage differential and for the integration of Negro families into the program of the Homestead Subsistence Division in the first recovery program.\n\nDavis and Weaver organized the Negro Industrial League to pressure New Deal agencies to address the needs of blacks. They monitored the hearings of the National Recovery Administration to ensure that blacks benefited from the program.\n\nTheir efforts led to the establishment of the Joint Committee on National Recovery, a group of twenty-six national groups, including the YWCA, National Urban League (NUL), and the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP). Davis became Executive Secretary of the JCNR, a position he held until 1936, serving as a legislative lobbyist. The committee lobbied for fair inclusion of African Americans in government-sponsored programs. It publicized incidents and patterns of racial discrimination. The implementation of a National Recovery Program promised to have immediate and long-term consequences for African Americans. While Davis and Weaver worked, more established African-American leaders deliberated about how to respond to the flurry of New Deal legislation.\n\nIn May 1935 a conference on the economic status of the Negro was held at Howard University in Washington, D.C., out of which emerged a major civil rights coalition that was active in the late 1930s and 1940s. The National Negro Congress—whose sponsors included Davis, Ralph J. Bunche and Alain Locke of Howard University, A. Philip Randolph of the Brotherhood of Sleeping Car Porters, James Ford of the Communist Party, Lester Granger and Elmer Carter of the Urban League, and Charles Hamilton Houston of the NAACP—was significant in two respects. Davis was one of the original founders; he served as Executive Secretary until 1942.\n\nThe NNC represented one of the first efforts of the 20th century to bring together under one umbrella black secular leaders, preachers, labor organizers, workers, businessmen, radicals, and professional politicians, with the assumption that the common denominator of race could weld together such divergent segments of black society. It was the Communist Party’s effort to build support among activists in the black mainstream. The evolution of the National Negro Congress dramatized the growing convergence of outlook between Communists and activist black intellectuals that had taken shape in the protests of the early Depression years and reached full fruition during the years of the Popular Front.\n\nIn 1943 Davis brought the first lawsuit challenging segregated schools in Washington, D.C., in the name of his five-year-old son Michael D. Davis, who was rejected from his neighborhood's Noyes School, a white elementary school. The \"Washington Star\" criticized the African-American lawyer for legally challenging the District's dual segregated school system after the principal of Noyes School refused to admit Mike Davis. The \"Washington Star\" paper said that District citizens had long accepted separate schools for blacks and whites, and that the suit brought by John P. Davis would cause deeper racial divisions in the nation's capital.\n\nIn response to Davis' suit, the US Congress appropriated federal funds to construct the Lucy D. Slowe elementary school, for African-American children, directly across the street from his Brookland neighborhood home. At that time, a committee of Congress directly administered District government.\n\nAfter World War II, in 1946 Davis was founding publisher of \"Our World\" magazine, a full-size, nationally distributed magazine to appeal to African-American readers. Its first issue, with singer-actress Lena Horne on the cover, appeared on the nation's newsstands in April 1946. \"Our World\" was a premier publication, covering contemporary topics from black history to sports and entertainment, with regular articles on health, fashion, politics and social awareness. It was based in New York City, the publishing capital of the country.\n\n\"Our World\" portrayed a thriving black America; its covers featured entertainers such as Lena Horne, Marian Anderson, Harry Belafonte, Eartha Kitt, Ella Fitzgerald, Louis Armstrong, Duke Ellington and Nat King Cole.\n\nIn 1964 Davis served as editor of special publications for the Phelps-Stokes Fund. He compiled in a single volume a reliable summary on the main aspects of Negro life in America, presenting it with historical depth to provide the reader with a true perspective. \"The American Negro Reference Book\" covered virtually every aspect of African-American life, present and past.\n\nThe largest collection of Davis' papers is in the Schomburg Center for Research in Black Culture, New York Public Library. Insight into Davis' political and social views can be found in his own writings. \"The Papers of the National Negro Congress\" reproduces all of the organization’s records that are housed at the Schomburg Center for Research in Black Culture, including the voluminous working files of Davis and successive executive secretaries of the National Negro Congress. Beginning with papers from 1933 that predate the formation of the National Negro Congress, the wide-ranging collection documents Davis’ involvement in the Negro Industrial League. It includes the \"Report Files\" of Davis’ interest in the \"Negro problem.\"\n\nThe most extensive overview of Davis' life is by Hilmar Jenson in an edition of his writings, John Preston Davis, \"The Forgotten Civil Rights\" (1996). Much of the scholarly writing about Davis focuses on his experiences in the National Negro Congress.\n\nArtifacts and papers of Davis are being acquired by the Smithsonian Institution's National Museum of African-American History and Culture.\n\n\"What the ‘New Deal’ Means for the Negro,\" 1935, from John P.

Hills Liberation Front is a militant group operating in Karbi Anglong district and Dima Hasao district (formerly known as the North Cachar Hills district) of Assam, India. Thong Teron is the general secretary of KLNLF. Karbi Anglong NC Hills People's Resistance is the armed wing of the organization. KLNLF emerged from the United People's Democratic Solidarity, being the anti-peace talks faction of UDPS. After the split, there has been turf wars between the two groups.\n\nIn July 2008, the Assam government estimated that KLNLF had a membership of 225. KLNLF is closely linked to the United Liberation Front of Asom.\n\n6 December is the foundation day of KLNLF.\n\nThe outfit claims to fight for the cause of Karbi tribes and its declared objective is Hemprek Kangthim, meaning self-rule/self-determination of the Karbi people.\n\nPradip Terang alias Pongbi Dilli is the ‘Chairman’ of the outfit. Har Sing Timung was the General Secretary till 2 January 2005, when he resigned from his position following serious differences with the ‘Commander-in-Chief’ Men Sing Takbi alias Willingson Timung. Laden Ronghang is the ‘Publicity Secretary’ of the group and ‘Incharge Central Publicity Cell’ is Thong Teron alias Rupsing Teron. The Assistant Foreign Secretary/ Revenue/Finance/Taxation of the outfit is Biren Lekthe alias Risso Tokbi.\n\nCurrently, the outfit has around 200 cadres operating in the Karbi Anglong district. The KLNLF Commander-in-Chief, Willingson Timung, was killed along with two other cadres by the General Secretary, Hor Sing Timung, on 2 February 2005. Later on 29 April 2005, Hor Sing Timung along with other four associates was executed by the outfit at a camp in Bangladesh for their involvement in the murder of Timung.\n\nWhile the group’s stronghold is the Karbi Anglong district, its presence has also been reported from Dima Hasao and Nagaon districts.\n\nThe outfit maintains close links with the United Liberation Front of Asom (ULFA). The ULFA’s ‘709th battalion’ operates out of two major bases in Karbi Anglong, with the KLNLF providing it with logistic support in return for weapons and ammunition.\n\nIt also reportedly has links with the Nagaland-based National Socialist Council of Nagaland - Isak-Muivah (NSCN-IM). On 11 May 2004, 31 KLNLF cadres along with five NSCN-IM militants were arrested from a bus on the Paren-Ghaspani Road on their way to Dimapur. These cadres had undergone training at a NSCN-IM camp and were reportedly part of the recent batch that passed out from there. On 13 October 2007, security forces neutralized a joint camp of the NSCN-IM and KLNLF inside Kaki Reserve Forest area in the Karbi Anglong district.\n\nAbductions for ransom and extortion are the main sources of funds for the group. According to official sources, the outfit generates a considerable amount of revenue by targeting the ginger producing Kukis in the Singhason Hills area. The non-Karbi Hindi – speaking traders are also targeted for extortion. In some case, even the Karbis are targeted for extortion.\n\n"}
{"id": "1650287", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1650287", "title": "Land patent", "text": "Land patent\n\nA land patent is an exclusive land grant made by a sovereign entity with respect to a particular tract of land. To make such a grant \"patent\", a sovereign (proprietary landowner) must document the land grant, securely sign and seal the document (patent), and openly publish the documents for the public to see. An official land patent is the highest evidence of right, title, and interest to a defined area. It is usually granted by a central, federal, or state government to an individual or to a private company.\n\nBesides \"patent\", other terms for the certificate that grants such rights include \"first-title deed\" and \"final certificate\". In the United States, all claims of land ownership can be traced back to a land patent, first-title deed, or similar document regarding land originally owned by France, Spain, the United Kingdom, Mexico, Russia, or Native Americans.\n\nA land patent is known in law as \"letters patent\", and usually issues to the original grantee and to their heirs and assigns forever. The patent stands as supreme title to the land because it attests that all evidence of title existent before its issue date was reviewed by the sovereign authority under which it was sealed and was so sealed as irrefutable; thus, at law the land patent itself so becomes the title to the land defined within its four corners.\n\nLand in the United States of America was acquired by annexation, purchase, treaty or war from France, Great Britain, the Kingdom of Hawaii, Mexico, Russia, Spain and the Native American peoples.\n\nAs England, later to become Great Britain, began to colonize America, the Crown made large grants of territory to individuals and companies. In turn, those companies and colonial governors later made smaller grants of land based on actual surveys of the land. Thus, in colonial America on the Atlantic seaboard, a connection was made between the surveying of a land tract and its \"patenting\" as private property.\n\nMany original colonies' land patents came from the corresponding country of control (e.g., Great Britain). Most such patents were permanently granted. Those patents are still in force; the United States government honors those patents by treaty law, and, as with all such land patents, they cannot be changed.\n\nAfter the American Revolution and the ratification of the Constitution of the United States, the United States Treasury Department was placed in charge of managing all public lands. In 1812, the General Land Office was created to assume that duty.\n\nIn accord with specific Acts of Congress, and under the hand and seal of the President of the United States of America, the General Land Office issued more than 2 million land grants made patent (land patents), passing the title of specific parcels of public land from the nation to private parties (individuals or private companies). Some of the land so granted had survey or other costs associated with it. Some patentees paid those fees for their land in cash, others homesteaded a claim, and still others came into ownership via one of the many donation acts that Congress passed to transfer public lands to private ownership. Whatever the method, the General Land Office followed a two-step procedure in granting a patent.\n\nFirst, the private claimant went to the land office in the land district where the public land was located. The claimant filled out entry papers to select the public land, and the land office register (clerk) checked the local registrar records to make sure the claimed land was still available. The receiver (bursar) took the claimant's payment, because even homesteaders had to pay administrative fees.\n\nNext, the district land office register and receiver sent the paperwork to the General Land Office in Washington. That office double-checked the accuracy of the claim, its availability and the form of payment. Finally, the General Land Office issued a land patent for the claimed public land and sent it on to the President for his signature.\n\nThe first United States land patent was issued on March 4, 1788, to John Martin. That patent reserves to the United States one third of all gold, silver, lead and copper within the claimed land.\nUsage restrictions (e.g., oil and mineral rights, roadways, ditches and canals) placed on the land are spelled out in the patent. Such private property rights can also be thereafter negotiated in accord with the terms of private contracts. The rights inherent in patented land are carried from heir to heir, heir to assignee, or assignee to assignee, and cannot be changed except by private contract (warranty deed, quitclaim deed, etc.). In most cases, the law of a particular piece of patented land will be governed by the Congressional Act or treaty under which it was acquired, or by terms spelled out in the patent. For example, in the United States the laws governing the land may involve the Homestead Act or reservations placed on the face of the patent, or the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo, which governs certain jurisdictional dicta relating to large amounts of land in California and adjoining territories.\n\nBecause most people become familiar with land rights only when they acquire real estate either by inheritance or through the process of a purchase contract, they never learn the difference between land and the property appurtenant to it. Accordingly, their familiarity with land law remains virtually non-existent; and, they only become accustomed to State statutory regulations relative to the property appurtenant to the land, that is to say: property taxing, zoning and building codes, etc.\n\nWhen a territory agreed to enter the Union of the United States of America, an Enabling Act was agreed to as a condition precedent of statehood. The Enabling Act requires that all unappropriated (not yet privately owned) lands be forever disclaimed by the territory and the people of the territory, and the title ceded to the United States for its disposition. For example, the enabling act of the Washington Territory declares, in part:\n\n... that the people inhabiting said proposed States do agree and declare that they forever disclaim all right and title to the unappropriated public lands lying within the boundaries thereof, and to all lands lying within said limits owned or held by any Indian or Indian tribes; and that until the title thereto shall have been extinguished by the United States, the same shall be and remain subject to the disposition of the United States. ..\n\nAfter the right and title to land was disclaimed by the people of the territory, it was held in trust by the United States until someone proved a claim to it, typically by improving the homestead parcel for a certain period of time. Once a proper claim has been filed, the General Land Office (now the Bureau of Land Management) certifies that the claimant has paid for a survey, as well as depositing another sum of money. Then, pursuant to the various land acts of Congress, the land is granted to the private owner by letters patent under the signature and seal of the President of the United States of America.\n\nLegal entities other than natural persons (such as trusts and corporations) cannot obtain land patents except by express act of the United States Congress. An example of Congress granting land through patents to corprate entities is the railroad grants made to compensate the railroad companies for building railroads across America.\n\nA land patent is permanent and cannot be changed by the government after its issuance except in case of fraud, clerical error, or failure to pay the initial administrative fees. A statute of limitations applies.\n\nhttp://www.glorecords.blm.gov/details/patent/default.aspx?accession=0001-001&docClass=CV&sid=xrhhmext.4e4#patentDetailsTabIndex=1\n"}
{"id": "169300", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=169300", "title": "Leipzig Declaration", "text": "Leipzig Declaration\n\nThe Leipzig Declaration on Global Climate Change is a statement made in 1995, seeking to refute the claim there is a scientific consensus on the global warming issue.\nIt was issued in an updated form in 1997 and revised again in 2005, claiming to have been signed by 80 scientists and 25 television news meteorologists while the posting of 33 additional signatories was pending verification that those 33 additional scientists still agreed with the statement. \nAll versions of the declaration, which opposes global warming and the Kyoto Protocol, were penned by Fred Singer's Science and Environmental Policy Project (SEPP).\n\nThe first declaration was based on a November 9–10, 1995 conference, organized by Helmut Metzner in Leipzig, Germany. The second declaration was additionally based on a successor conference in Bonn, Germany on November 10–11, 1997. The conferences were cosponsored by SEPP and the European Academy for Environmental Affairs and titled \"International Symposium on the Greenhouse Controversy\".\n\nToday, the declaration is regarded as disinformation campaign, exercised by the climate change denial movement using the fake-expert-strategy, to cast doubt on the scienctific consensus about global warming.\n\nThe 1995 declaration asserts: \"There does not exist today a general scientific consensus about the importance of greenhouse warming from rising levels of carbon dioxide. On the contrary, most scientists now accept the fact that actual observations from earth satellites show no climate warming whatsoever.\" The latter statement was broadly accurate at the time, but with additional data and correction of errors, all analyses of satellite temperature measurements now show statistically significant warming.\n\nThe declaration also criticised the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, saying: \"Energy is essential for all economic growth, and fossil fuels provide today's principal global energy source. In a world in which poverty is the greatest social pollutant, any restriction on energy use that inhibits economic growth should be viewed with caution. For this reason, we consider 'carbon taxes' and other drastic control policies ... to be ill-advised, premature, wrought with economic danger, and likely to be counterproductive.\"\n\nAccording to the SEPP website, there were 79 signatures to the 1995 declaration, including Frederick Seitz: the current SEPP chair. Perhaps the most prominent signatory to the declaration was Dr. Robert E. Stevenson, a former research scientist for NASA and the Scripps Institution of Oceanography. The signature list was last updated on July 16, 1996. Of these 79, 33 failed to respond when SEPP asked them to sign the 1997 declaration. SEPP calls the signatories \"nearly 100 climate experts\".\n\nThe signatures to the 1995 declaration were disputed by David Olinger of the \"St. Petersburg Times\". In an article on July 29, 1996, he revealed that many signers, including Chauncey Starr, Robert Balling, and Patrick Michaels, have received funding from the oil industry, while others had no scientific training or could not be identified.\n\nThe 1995 declarations begins: \"As scientists, we are intensely interested in the possibility that human activities may affect the global climate\". However, those identified as scientists and climate experts include at least ten weather presenters, including Dick Groeber of Dick's Weather Service in Springfield, Ohio. Groeber, who had not completed a university degree, labelled himself a scientist by virtue of his thirty to forty years of self-study.\n\nIn any case, it is difficult to accurately evaluate the list of signatures of the 1995 declaration, as the SEPP website provides no additional details about them except for their university, if they are professors.\n\nThe 1997 declaration updated the 1995 declaration in a number of ways. The most obvious difference was its focus on the Kyoto Protocol, as the Kyoto conference was in the process of being finalised. The declaration says:\n\nThe 1997 declaration also updated its citations of evidence that appeared to run contrary to the consensus on global warming. For example, the 1995 declaration cites \"observations from earth satellites,\" where the 1997 declaration cites \"observations from both weather satellites and balloon-borne radiosondes.\" As with satellite data, subsequent analysis of radiosondes has shown a statistically significant warming trend.\n\nThe declaration begins: \"As independent scientists concerned with atmospheric and climate problems, we...\". As with the 1995 declaration, questions have been raised about the scientific background of the signers, and others have questioned the degree to which they can be deemed to be independent. Because many of those who signed the 1997 declaration also signed the 1995 declaration, the concerns raised by David Olinger and others after the 1995 declaration are still relevant.\n\nThe signers are generally described by Fred Singer and his supporters as climate scientists, although the current signers also include 25 weather presenters. One key report opposing the scientific credentials of the signers was a Danish Broadcasting Company TV special by Øjvind Hesselager. \nHesselager attempted to contact the declaration's 33 European signers and found that four of them could not be located, twelve denied ever having signed, and some had not even heard of the Leipzig Declaration. Those who verified signing included a medical doctor, a nuclear scientist, and an entomologist. After discounting the signers whose credentials were inflated, irrelevant, false, or unverifiable, Hesselager claimed that only 20 of the names on the list had any scientific connection with the study of climate change, and some of those names were known to have obtained grants from the oil and fuel industry, including the German coal industry and the government of Kuwait (a major oil exporter). As a result of Hesselager's report, Singer removed some, but not all, of the discredited signatures. The number of signatures on the document, according to SEPP's own press releases, has declined from 140 (according to a December 1997 press release) to 105 ().\n\nSEPP's position is that \"a few of the original signers did not have the 'proper' academic credentials - even though they understand the scientific climate issues quite well. To avoid this kind of smear, we want to restrict the Leipzig Declaration to signers with impeccable qualifications.\" To address the signer credibility issue, SEPP has provided considerably more information about each signer on their website and lists the weather presenters separately from the other signers.\n\nAs of 2010, Singer's SEPP website listed the \"2005, revised\" declaration (which still spoke of the 1997 Kyoto conference as a future event). This version included the claim: \"In fact, many climate specialists now agree that actual observations from weather satellites show no global warming whatsoever\".\n\nThe declarations have been widely cited by some in the \"sound science\" movement. It has been cited by Fred Singer in editorial columns appearing in hundreds of websites and major publications, including \"The Wall Street Journal\", \"Miami Herald\", \"Detroit News\", \"Chicago Tribune\", \"The Plain Dealer\", \"Memphis Commercial Appeal\", \"The Seattle Times\", and \"The Orange County Register\". Jeff Jacoby, a columnist with the \"Boston Globe\", described the signers of the Leipzig Declaration as \"climate scientists\" that \"include prominent scholars.\" Think tanks such as The Heritage Foundation, The Heartland Institute, and Australia's Institute for Public Affairs called them \"noted scientists.\" Both the Leipzig Declaration and Frederick Seitz's Oregon Petition have been quoted as authoritative sources during deliberations in the U.S. Senate and House of Representatives.\n\nAlthough the key data on which the Leipzig declaration relied (such as satellite temperature measurements) has been invalidated by subsequent research, and much new evidence has accumulated, the declaration continues to be cited, along with the Oregon Petition, as evidence of the current views of scientists on climate change. Moreover, the organizers have not changed their stated position of rejecting anthropogenic global warming.\n\n1995 declaration:\n\n1997 declaration:\n\n2005 declaration (revised):\n\n\n"}

Between 1825 and 1830 more than a dozen such colonies were established in the United States, inspired by the ideas of Robert Owen. All of these met with economic failure and rapid disestablishment within one or a comparatively few years.\n\nThe Owenite movement of the 1820s was one of the four primary branches of secular Utopian Socialism in the United States during the 19th century, antedating Fourierism (1843–50), Icarianism (1848–98) and Bellamyism (1889–96).\n\nThe communitarian ideas of Welsh reformer Robert Owen (1772–1837) were popularized in the United States by his arrival in America in November 1824. Owen had learned that an already established Rappite religious community at Harmony, Indiana was for sale and set sail for America with a view acquiring it from the Harmony Society and thereby making it a model for his collectivist plans. This initial American community of Owen, a tract of 30,000 acres on the Wabash River which included farmland, dwellings, and factories, would be rechristened \"New Harmony\" and served as the inspiration for the establishment of other Owenite colonies.\n\nThe idea of Owenite communities in the United States was boosted by two widely publicized addresses by Owen made before the United States Congress, dated February 25 and March 7, 1825. The assembled audience included President John Quincy Adams, several members of his cabinet, the justices of the Supreme Court of the United States, and a number of other invited luminaries.\n\nOwen was assisted in his development of New Harmony by Philadelphian William Maclure, himself a wealthy philanthropist as well as the leading American geologist of the day. Other leading American intellectuals directly participated in the project, including preeminent zoologist Thomas Say, painter Charles Alexandre Lesueur, visionary pedagogue Francis Neef, and Scottish-born feminist and freethinker Frances \"Fanny\" Wright, among others.\n\nA brief fad followed seeking the realization of Owen's ideas in practice, resulting in the formation of over a dozen Owenite communities. All of these proved short-lived, whether owing to internal dissension or an inability to generate a surplus producing manufactured goods and agricultural products sufficient to retire debts incurred. By about 1830 the Owenite movement in America had vanished with little trace, the established village of New Harmony having long since converted to operation on an individualistic basis.\n\n\n"}

The term can also be used to describe municipally owned corporations.\n\nMunicipal incorporation occurs when such municipalities become self-governing entities under the laws of the state or province in which they are located. Often, this event is marked by the award or declaration of a municipal charter. A city charter or town charter or municipal charter) is a legal document establishing a municipality such as a city or town.\n\nIn Canada charters are granted by provincial authorities.\n\nThe Corporation of Chennai is the oldest Municipal Corporation in the world after UK.\n\nThe title \"corporation\" was used in boroughs from soon after the Norman conquest until the Local Government Act 2001. Under the 2001 act, county boroughs were renamed \"cities\" and their corporations became \"city councils\"; other borough corporations were renamed \"borough councils\".\n\nAfter the Partition of Ireland, the corporations in the Irish Free State were Dublin, Cork, Limerick and Waterford (county boroughs) and Drogheda, Kilkenny, Sligo, Clonmel, and Wexford (non-county boroughs). Dún Laoghaire gained borough status in 1930 as “The Corporation of Dun Laoghaire\".

Some MOCs rely on revenue from user fees, distinguishing them from agencies and special districts funded through taxation, although this is not always the case. Municipal corporation follows a process of externalization that requires new skills and orientations from the respective local governments, and follow common changes in the institutional landscape of public services.

The National Advancement Party voluntarily deregistered with Elections Canada on December 31, 2017, and created a new party called the National Citizens Alliance, which applied for registration with Elections Canada in May 2018.\n\nThe party is headquartered in Calgary, Alberta and led by writer Stephen Garvey. \n\nIn August 2015, the National Advancement Party of Canada was registered under the party name, Democratic Advancement Party of Canada (DAPC). The DAPC ran four candidates in the 2015 federal election. In January 2017, the party name was changed to National Advancement Party of Canada (NAPC).\n\nOn December 13, 2017 the National Advancement Party voluntarily deregistered itself from Elections Canada effective December 31, 2017.\n\nThe NAPC, under the DAPC name, fielded four candidates.

The party states it supports LGBT rights but also states it will prohibit \"schools and any other relevant organizations/institutions from exposing children to indoctrination [on] sexual identity\". The party supports gun rights, and describes the current gun regulations as excessive and ineffective. They want to increase penalties for animal cruelty, and a full ban on bestiality, which is currently only partly banned in Canada.

In 1999 the newspaper was merged with another of Frey's publications, the \"Deutscher Anzeiger\", and became the \"National Zeitung\".\n\nThe Bavarian Office for the Protection of the Constitution classifies the \"National Zeitung\" as propagating a xenophobic, nationalist and revisionist world view.\n\nAccording to the Bavarian Office for the Protection of the Constitution, the DSZ Druckschriften- und Zeitungs-Verlag GmbH, publisher of the \"National Zeitung\", was, for a long time, the most important publisher of far right propaganda in Germany. The Bavarian Office for the Protection of the Constitution classifies the \"National Zeitung\" as propagating a xenophobic, nationalist and revisionist world view.\n\nThe newspaper is critical of foreigners in Germany, of German rapprochement with Poland and of Israel, accusing the German government of subservience to the latter. It frequently uses inflammatory language and tries to deflect from the German crimes during World War II by instead reporting on real or alleged German victims of the war.\n\nDespite the stereotypical far-right content, the newspaper frequently reiterates its commitment to the German constitution. The newspaper also contains a large amount of advertising for Frey's former businesses, like \"Deutsche Reisen\", a travel service, and the \"Deutsche Buchdienst\", which sells books, medals and flags.\n\nDuring his lifetime, a former employee described Frey as unbelievably greedy and accused him of using his publications for personal enrichment by constantly asking subscribers for donations to various causes, selling commemorative coins of \"outstanding Germans\" like Rudolf Hess or Hans-Ulrich Rudel with a huge mark-up, or asking them to join one of the connected associations, like the \"Aktion Oder-Neiße\", the \"Ehrenbund Rudel\" (Honor Federation Rudel) or \"Initiative für Ausländerbegrenzung\" (Initiative for the limitation of foreigners).\n\nAn earlier, unrelated, \"National Zeitung\" had existed in Germany from 1848 onward, as a liberal newspaper, published in Berlin. A \"Deutsche National-Zeitung\" was also published in German language in the United States from 1838 to 1840, in Philadelphia. \n\nThe \"National Zeitung\" was first published as the \"Deutsche Soldaten-Zeitung\" (English: German Soldiers Newspaper) in 1951. The idea for a newspaper as an advocate for the rights of German soldiers originated in a prisoner of war camp in Garmisch-Partenkirchen and came from Nazi \"Kreisleiter\" Helmut Damerau and the Wehrmacht Colonel Heinrich Detloff von Kalben. It was supported by Waffen-SS General Paul Steiner and financed by Leo Giess, a carpenter, as well as German Americans. \n\nThe \"Deutsche Soldaten-Zeitung\" was an advocate of German rearmament but found itself in financial trouble by 1953, when financial support from the US dried up. Damerau approached the West German government for financial support and the newspaper received a monthly subsidy of DM 11,000 from 1953 onward. This however was not received well by the paper's readership, and the circulation of the \"Deutsche Soldaten-Zeitung\" dropped from 30,000 to 12,000. In 1954 the German government pushed for the sale of the paper, which Damerau refused and, consequently, the government dropped its financial support. The paper was subsequently only published fortnightly and, for a time in 1955, only monthly and shifted further to the right of the political spectrum.\n\nThe fifth anniversary of the first publication of the paper saw it print well-wishes from a number of high ranking former Wehrmacht Generals, among them the former \"Generalfeldmarschalls\" Erich von Manstein, Wilhelm List and Albert Kesselring.\n\nIt called for and organised protests, like when German Handball club THW Kiel hosted a team from Wrocław, Poland, because, in the paper's opinion Wrocław should be refereed to by its former German name, Breslau. It protested against any form of recognition of the post-war Polish-German border, the Oder–Neisse line and attacked prominent German scientists like Carl Friedrich von Weizsäcker for publishing the Memorandum of Tübingen (German:\"Tübinger Memorandum\") in support of the border. The newspaper also supported the wife of Rudolf Hess in her attempts to free her husband.\n\nThe newspaper advocated a return to German military traditions after the formation of the Bundeswehr and attempted to influence officers who had previously served in the Wehrmacht. It was critical of Wolf Graf von Baudissin's concept of citizens in uniform, and the West German government became, in turn, critical of the newspaper. German defence minister Franz-Josef Strauß made unsuccessful attempts to purchase the newspaper, offering Damerau DM 150,000 for the financially troubled paper. Damerau instead asked right-wing journalist Gerhard Frey for a loan and the latter, independently wealthy, gradually gained a controlling interest in the \"Deutsche Soldaten-Zeitung\".\n\nThe newspaper continued to publish content with a historical revisionist view, attempting to deflect Germany's responsibility for World War II and attacking members of the German resistance as traitors to the Fatherland.\n\nSince 1959 under Frey's control, the \"Deutsche Soldaten-Zeitung\" was renamed \"Deutsche National-Zeitung und Soldaten-Zeitung\" in 1960–61. It raised its circulation from 27,500 in 1958 to 70,000 by 1963 and 131,000 by 1967. Frey, while not outrightly denying the Holocaust, illegal in Germany, stated that the he considered the number of victims as to high, and argued in the 1960s that Germany should pay less compensation because of this. Frey and his newspaper frequently published anti-Israel and pro-Arab content.\n\nIn 1963, the newspaper was renamed \"Deutsche National-Zeitung\". In 1987, Gerhard Frey founded the German far right party Deutsche Volksunion. \n\nFrey's aim had been to make the \"National Zeitung\" the central national organ of all far right parties in Germany. \n\nIn 1971 Frey published a second paper, the \"Deutscher Anzeiger\". In 1986, he purchased the revisionist \"Deutsche Wochen-Zeitung\", which had originally been published by members of the far-right National Democratic Party of Germany. In 1991, Frey merged the two newspapers into one, becoming the \"Deutsche Wochen-Zeitung – Deutscher Anzeiger\". Content of this paper was almost identical to the \"Deutsche National-Zeitung\" and, in 1999, the two were merged into one, becoming the \"National Zeitung\".\n\nDespite all this and the fact that Germany grew in size and population after the German reunion, the circulation of the newspaper had dropped to 38,000 by 2007.\n\nThe newspaper was featured in the West German movie Roses for the Prosecutor, in which one of the main characters, the state prosecutor Dr. Schramm, a man with a secret Nazi past, purchases the \"Deutsche Soldaten-Zeitung\". The newspaper subsequently used this exposure for advertisement.\n\n"}

As \"ExpertLaw\" puts it: \"Premises liability law is the body of law which makes the person who is in possession of land or premises responsible for certain injuries suffered by persons who are present on the premises\". \n\nFor premises liability to apply:\n\nAt common law, in the case of landowners, the extent of their duty of care to those who came on their premises varied depending on whether a person was classified as a trespasser, licensee, or invitee. This rule was eventually abolished in some common law jurisdictions. For example, England enacted the Occupiers Liability Act 1957. Similarly, in the 1968 landmark case of \"Rowland v. Christian\", the Supreme Court of California replaced the old classifications with a general duty of care to \"all\" persons on one's land, regardless of their status. After several highly publicized and controversial cases, the California Legislature enacted a statute in 1985 that partially restored immunity to landowners from some types of lawsuits from trespassers.\n\nColorado's highest court adopted the \"Rowland\" unified duty of care analysis in 1971. The resulting explosion of lawsuits against Colorado landowners caused the state legislature to enact the Colorado Premises Liability Act in 1986, which enacted a cleaned-up statutory version of the common law classifications \"and\" simultaneously expressly displaced all common law remedies against landowners in order to prevent state courts from again expanding their liability.\n\nIn the Republic of Ireland, under the Occupiers' Liability Act, 1995, the duty of care to trespassers, visitors and \"recreational users\" can be restricted by the occupier; provided reasonable notice is given, for which a prominent notice at the usual entrance to the premises usually suffices.\n\nIn United States law, premises liability law is highly developed and can differ from state to state.

Candidates are also imperfectly informed about the utility preferences of the electorate and the distribution of voters' preferences.\n\nUnlike the median voter theorem, what drives the equilibrium policy is both the numerosity and the density of social groups and not the median position of voters on a preference scale. This difference explains why social groups which have a great homogeneity of preferences are more politically powerful than those whose preferences are dispersed.\n\nPolitical economy and public economics are the main fields where the probabilistic voting theory is applied. In particular, it was used to explain public expenditure (Persson & Tabellini, 2000; Hassler, Krusell, Storesletten & Zilibotti, 2005), public debt dynamics (Song, Storesletten & Zilibotti, 2012), effect of mass media (Strömberg, 2004) social security systems (Profeta, 2002; Gonzalez Eiras & Niepelt, 2008) and taxation (Hettich & Winer, 2005; Canegrati, 2007).\n\nRaphael Boleslavsky and Christopher Cotton (2015) show how the underlying uncertainty that candidates have about the preferences of voters may be the result of information revelation during campaigns, with more informative campaigns leading to greater ex ante uncertainty about election-day preferences. This in turn can increase policy divergence. \n\nProbabilistic voting models are usually preferred to traditional Downsian median voter models, as in the former all voters have an influence on the policy outcome, whereas in the latter all power rests in the hands of the pivotal voter or group. For instance, in models where young and old (or rich and poor) voters have conflicting interests, probabilistic voting models predict that the winning candidate strikes a balance between the different interests in her/his policy platform. Due to the smooth mapping between the distribution of policy preferences and the political outcomes, this model has proven to be very tractable and convenient to use in dynamic models with repeated voting.\n\nAssar Lindbeck, and Jörgen W.

RRFM events are often hosted by people unaffiliated with any large organization and are encouraged to sprout up by anyone, at anytime, anywhere. The RRFM movement aims to counteract capitalism in a proactive way by creating a positive example to challenge the myths of scarcity and competition. The name Really Really Free Market is itself a play on words: it is a reinterpretation and re-envisioning of the term Free Market which generally refers to an economy of consumerism governed by supply and demand. The RRFM holds as a major goal to build a community based on sharing resources, caring for one another and improving the collective lives of all. Markets often vary in character, but they generally offer both goods and services. Participants bring unneeded items and food, as well as skills and talents such as entertainment, massage, arts and crafts, language lessons, plants, haircuts, yoga, and more. A RRFM usually takes place in an open community space such as a public park or community commons.\n\n The first known Really, Really Free Market took place in at a Food Not Bombs meal in Christchurch, New Zealand as a protest to a meeting on free trade. The Really Really Free Markets started to spread around Asia. Jakarta Food Not Bombs organized a Really Really Free Market on Buy Nothing Day. The first Really Really Free Market in the United States happened simultaneously in Miami, Florida, and Raleigh, North Carolina during the anti-globalization protests against the FTAA in 2003. The idea of a \"Really, Really Free Market\" emerged from a visioning ritual by members of the Pagan Cluster in Austin in preparation of the FTAA Summit in Miami, November 2003. Members of the Green Bloc picked up the idea and made it real. Participants from the SouthEast Anarchist Network (SeaNET) held demonstrations using the Really, Really Free Market to protest the G8 summit in 2004. The idea quickly spread across the United States, Russia, and other countries such as Australia, England, Malaysia, Taiwan, South Africa, and Canada.\n\nThe movement has taken root in dozens of cities in the United States, with some holding one-time events, annual, bi-monthly, and even monthly markets. Cities include San Diego, CA; San Francisco, CA; San Jose, CA; Washington, DC; Miami, FL; Tallahassee, FL; Athens, GA; Bloomington, IL; Rockford, IL; Indianapolis, IN; Des Moines, IA; Louisville, KY; Detroit, MI; Grand Rapids, MI; Minneapolis, MN; Kansas City, MO; Reno, NV; Albuquerque, NM; Belfast, NY; Ithaca, New York; New York, NY; Carrboro, NC; Charlotte, NC; Greensboro, NC; Greenville, NC; Raleigh, NC; Washington, NC; Wilmington, NC; Cincinnati, OH; Dayton, OH; Yellow Springs, OH; Cottage Grove, OR; Lancaster, PA; Pittsburgh, PA; Kingsport, TN; Austin, TX; Richmond, VA; Shepherdstown, WV; and Milwaukee, WI.\n\nThe San Francisco Really Really Free Market was started sometime around 2004. The SF RRFM was spearheaded by local activist Kirsten Brydum until her tragic passing in 2008. From around 2007 until 2010 the SF RRFM was hosted on the last Saturday of every month in Mission Dolores Park. During this time, the SF RRFM was an especially popular event that received decent local media exposure. Since then it has sprouted up organically in Union Square, among other places. During 2007-2010 local organizers would distribute \"seed packets:\" a CD that served as digital collection of flyers, announcements, musings, pictures, and essays. This was part of the ongiong effort to encourage others to start their own RRFM. These seed packets are now compiled for download online.\n\nThe Singapore Really Really Free Market began around January 2009 and continues going strong in 2017.\n\nThe first Russian Really Really Free Market was organized in Moscow in 2008. The original name of RRFM was changed to \"Freemarket\" or \"Absolutely Free Fair\". Since that time the idea of RRFM has spread widely across the Russian Federation. Recently participants of the movement arrange regular meetings in Moscow, Saint Petersburg, Ivanovo, Yekaterinburg, Perm, Belgorod, Kirov, Kaliningrad, Nizhny Novgorod, Yaroslavl, Vologda, Volgograd, Tolyatti, Volzhsky, Petrozavodsk.\n\nDue to the often harsh Russian climate the RRFMs usually take place indoors, but summer time meetings often occur in public parks, yards of apartment houses or city squares. In Ivanovo, for instance, the very first free fair was held in Yesenin Square on 19 June 2011, but as winter set in, the RRFM meetings were moved to the reference room of the Regional Public library.\n\nRRFMs in Russia are often accompanied by master classes in handiwork (mehendi, hair dressing, making stencils for textile printing, etc.), lectures on social and ecological problems and the collection of secondary raw materials and charity fundraising in aid animal shelters.\n\n\n"}

Among Irish speakers, \"Sinn féin! Sinn féin!\" was also an exhortation to quell a brimming feud, i.e. \"we are all one here!\" When English-speakers adopted the slogan, the most common gloss was \"ourselves alone\", which was also used as a political slogan; it is unclear whether the English or Irish version came first. Ben Novick says the less accurate translation was adopted \"as it more clearly summed up the philosophy behind the movement\". Alvin Jackson says it may have been a construct of opponents to highlight the individuals' political isolation or the perceived selfishness of abandoning Britain, as in this \"Punch\" parody from the First World War:\n\nChristopher Hitchens, writing of the \"Field Day\" anthology of Irish literature, says:\n\n\"Ourselves Alone\" was a 1936 British film, set during the Anglo-Irish War of 1919–21.\n\nA collection was published in 1845 of poems printed in \"The Nation\", the nationalist newspaper of the Young Irelanders. It includes a poem entitled \"Ourselves Alone\" by \"Sliabh Cuilinn\" (John O'Hagan):\n\nAnother poem in the same volume, \"The Spirit of the Nation\" by D.F. McCarthy, uses the expression \"Sinn Féin\". The gloss in the original for this is 'Ourselves—or \".\"'\n\nThe glossary at the end of the volume renders \"sinn féin\" as \"we ourselves\".\n\nA nationalist play by \"Tom Telephone\" (Thomas Stanislaus Cleary) published in 1882 was entitled \"Shin Fain; or Ourselves Alone\".\n\nIn James Joyce's novel \"Ulysses\", set in 1904, The Citizen, a boorish nationalist partly modelled on Michael Cusack, shouts \"Sinn Féin! Sinn Féin amháin!\" during an altercation with Leopold Bloom; these were also the titles of two nationalist ballads.\n\nThe name was adopted by Arthur Griffith for the \"Sinn Féin policy\" he presented in 1905, and the Sinn Féin party formed over 1905–07. In the 1910s, \"Sinn Feiners\" was a common, often derogatory, label for militant nationalists, regardless of any connection to Griffith's movement. A 1915 mock-unionist article in a University College Dublin student journal distinguished types of Irish nationalist:\n\nWhen the Irish Volunteers split in September 1914, the more militant group was soon dubbed the \"Sinn Féin Volunteers\" by the security forces of the Dublin Castle administration. Likewise, the 1916 Easter Rising was quickly dubbed the \"Sinn Féin rebellion\" by British-oriented newspapers. However, the Sinn Féin party had no role in the Volunteers or the Rising, although many members had participated. All members of the party's National Council were interned after the Rising. The distinction between the specific party and the broader slogan of radical nationalism was finally blurred in 1917, when Griffith yielded leadership of the party to Éamon de Valera, the senior surviving leader of the Rising.\n\nSir Warren Fisher was sent by the UK government in 1920 to report on the Dublin Castle administration; in his highly critical report, he stated:\n\n\n"}

Critics claimed the referendum was pushed by religious and conservative organisations, aiming to block gay couples from gaining more rights.\n\nThe referendum was not valid as the turnout did not reach the required threshold of 50%, with only 21.4% of citizens casting a vote.\n\nIn June 2014, the Slovakia National Council amended the country's constitution to specifically deny same sex couples the legal protections associated with marriage.\n\nThe referendum was initiated after the conservative church backed group Alliance for Family gathered 400,000 signatures calling for a vote on the law. The Conference of Slovak Bishops, which organises anti-abortion and anti-euthanasia rallies overwhelmingly supported the move.\n\nVoters were asked questions on three issues: \n\nA fourth question on registered partners was rejected by the Constitutional Court.\n\nIn order for the proposal to be approved, voter turnout needed to be at least 50%.\n\nSupporters of the referendum campaigned predominantly in churches, with the Conference of Slovak Bishops raising funds for the campaign. 62% of Slovaks identify as Catholics, and although less than 40 percent of those attend mass regularly, Reuters describes Slovakia as \"one of the most religious countries in Europe on the surface\".\n\nThe vote, which cost more than €6.3 million to run, led to conservative groups spending around €110,000 on advertisements. The Christian conservative activism platform CitizenGo, run by Brian S. Brown, the American founder of the National Organization for Marriage, supported the referendum.\n\nSlovakia's LGBT groups, which are smaller and less organised than their opponents, encouraged people not to vote at all, for fear that \"no\" voters might push turnout over 50%.\n\nFormer Slovak Prime Minister Iveta Radičová said that if the referendum passes, \"It will not improve the standing of families and marriages; and there won’t be any more children, either.\" She criticised the referendum as being pushed by people \"want to cover up the real problems\" in Slovakia, like \"balancing of work responsibilities with childcare, unemployment,\" financial insecurity and domestic violence. Radičová described the movement as motivated by \"the fear of the new, the unknown, and the other\" and condemned opposition to sex education, pointing out that it is proven to reduce sexually transmitted diseases, unwanted pregnancies, and delay sexual experimentation.\n\nThe libertarian party Freedom and Solidarity criticised the referendum, as did the EU parliament's Socialists and Democrats.\n\nBoris Dittrich criticised the involvement of American Evangelical donors like Alliance Defending Freedom in determining the social agenda in Eastern European democracies, when they had lost on same-sex marriage in America. Amnesty International has condemned the country's discrimination against LGBT people and the international media, including The Economist, critiqued the political process in the country. Gay rights groups criticised the referendum, saying \"unemployment, social problems and alcoholism\" would not be solved by a vote to ban gay marriages or adoptions. International critics criticised the ruling social democratic party for pandering to populist religious homophobia, and critiqued the ballot as a waste of millions of euros, and a distraction from Slovakia's economic woes, and \"genuine problems of Slovak public policy.\"\n\nPope Francis supported the referendum, blessing the opponents of gay rights, stating “I greet the pilgrims from Slovakia and, through them, I wish to express my appreciation to the entire Slovak church, encouraging everyone to continue their efforts in defense of the family, the vital cell of society.”\n\nA group of theologians issued a position paper claiming that the referendum is touching on ethical questions and those should be solved by discussion rather than by voting. The authors of the position Ondrej Prostredník, František Ábel and Igor Kišš, all from the Lutheran Theological Faculty of Comenius University in Bratislava also claimed that several times in history the way of shortcuts and authoritarian decisions in favor of Christian values proved to be bad and damaged the very cause of Christ’s Gospel. They also criticized the referendum as an immoral attempt to shift the responsibility for the crisis of family values in the Slovak society to homosexuals. The position paper as joined by 48 theologians and intellectuals from different churches and sectors of the society.\n\nAnother EU nation, Croatia, banned same-sex marriages in a constitutional referendum on 1 December 2013. Turnout in Croatia was also less than 50%, but its constitution does not invalidate a referendum based on turnout.\n\nA Eurobarometer poll on in 2006 found that 19% of Slovaks supported same sex marriage and 81% opposed, while 12% supported and 84% opposed LGBT adoption. A European Social Survey in 2010 found that 42% of Slovaks believe that “gay men and lesbians should be free to live their own lives as they wish.”\n\nPolls suggested that only 35% of the population intended to vote in the referendum, with 85% of respondents supporting the first motion banning same sex marriage, 78% supporting a ban on LGBT adoption, and 70% supporting the third question on sex education. Opposition towards the referendum questions was higher amongst students, single people, those under 35, supporters of the libertarian party Freedom and Solidarity, those with openly gay family members or colleagues, people who live in more progressive town environments, and atheists and people with weaker religious beliefs.\n\nThe referendum was deemed invalid due to low turnout, with just 21.4% of eligible voters casting votes, far short of the 50% required for the results to be legally binding.\n\n"}

{"id": "1441686", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1441686", "title": "Structural unemployment", "text": "Structural unemployment\n\nStructural unemployment is a form of unemployment caused by a mismatch between the skills that workers in the economy can offer, and the skills demanded of workers by employers (also known as the skills gap). Structural unemployment is often brought about by technological changes that make the job skills of many of today's workers obsolete. \n\nStructural unemployment is one of several major categories of unemployment distinguished by economists, including frictional unemployment, cyclical unemployment, involuntary unemployment, and classical unemployment.\n\nBecause it requires either migration or re-training, structural unemployment can be long-term and slow to fix.\n\nFrom an individual perspective, structural unemployment can be due to:\n\nFrom a larger perspective, there can be a number of reasons for structural unemployment across large numbers of workers:\n\nLarge-scale changes in the economy can be particularly challenging. For example, if a large company is the only employer in a given industry for a certain city, when it closes workers will have no competing company to move to, and the local education system and government will be burdened with many people who need job re-training all at once (possibly at the same time the local economy fails to create new jobs due to decreased overall demand).\n\nEmployers may also reject workers for reasons unrelated to skills or geography, so for example structural unemployment can also result from discrimination.\n\nWhile temporary changes in overall demand for labor cause cyclical unemployment, structural unemployment can be caused by temporary changes in demand from different industries. For example, seasonal unemployment often affects farm workers after harvesting is complete, and workers in resort towns after the tourist season ends. The dot-com bubble caused a temporary spike in demand for information technology workers, which was suddenly reversed in 2000-2001.\n\nStructural unemployment is often associated with workers being unable to shift from industry to industry, but it can also happen within industries as technology changes the nature of work within a given field. This is a driver of skills gaps as technology and globalization \"hollow out\" many middle-skill jobs, positions that traditionally have not required a college degree.\n\nStructural unemployment is hard to separate empirically from frictional unemployment, except to say that it lasts longer. As with frictional unemployment, simple demand-side stimulus will not work to easily abolish this type of unemployment.\n\nSeasonal unemployment may be seen as a kind of structural unemployment, since it is a type of unemployment that is linked to certain kinds of jobs (construction work, migratory farm work). The most-cited official unemployment measures erase this kind of unemployment from the statistics using \"seasonal adjustment\" techniques.\n\nStructural unemployment may also be encouraged to rise by persistent cyclical unemployment: if an economy suffers from long-lasting low aggregate demand, it means that many of the unemployed become disheartened, while their skills (including job-searching skills) become \"rusty\" and obsolete. Problems with debt may lead to homelessness and a fall into the vicious circle of poverty. This means that they may not fit the job vacancies that are created when the economy recovers. The implication is that sustained high demand may lower structural unemployment. This theory of persistence in structural unemployment has been referred to as an example of path dependence or \"hysteresis.\"\n\nThere has been considerable debate over how much a role structural unemployment plays in the persistently high unemployment rates seen in much of the world since the 2007-09 global recession. Narayana Kocherlakota, then president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis, said in a 2010 speech that as much as 3 percent of the 9.5 percent unemployment rate at the time could be the result of a mismatch. Other studies argued that a skills mismatch was a minor factor, since unemployment rose for nearly all industries and demographic groups during the \"Great Recession.\" A Federal Reserve Bank of New York study found no strong evidence of mismatch for construction workers, a group often prone to structural unemployment because of the regional nature of construction.\n\nSome economists posit that the minimum wage is in part to blame for structural unemployment, although structural unemployment does exist even in the absence of a minimum wage. They assert that because the governmentally imposed minimum wage is higher than some individuals' marginal revenue product in any given job, that those individuals remain unemployed because employers legally cannot pay them what they are \"worth.\" Others believe that in such cases (for example, when a person is intellectually disabled or suffers a debilitating physical condition) it is the responsibility of the state to provide for the citizen in question. When a minimum wage does not exist, more people may be employed, but they may be underemployed and thus unable to fully provide for themselves.\n\nManagement professor Peter Cappelli blames poor human resource practices for complaints that not enough qualified job applicants are found, such as replacing skilled HR workers with software that is less capable of matching resumes that exhibit the right combination of skills but without word-for-word alignment with a job posting. (This actually may be a form of frictional unemployment if a match will eventually be made, perhaps with a different employer.) Cappelli also points to a decrease in apprenticeships and hiring from within an organization. Instead, companies attempt to avoid the time and cost of on-the-job training by hiring people from who already have experience doing the same job elsewhere (including at a competitor).\n\n\n\n"}

The USFA advocates food sovereignty, which is the right to sufficient and culturally appropriate food to all people and communities, and aims to reestablish better relations between food producers and consumers, placing the needs of local farmers, fishers, indigenous peoples and landless workers most impacted by global hunger, poverty, and unbalanced food distribution above agribusiness and larger corporations. The USFA is organized into four Alliance Teams: Land & Resource Grabs, Immigrant Rights & Trade, Defense of Mother Earth, and Racism & Leadership.\n\nThe US Food Sovereignty Alliance is a member of the International Planning Committee for Food Sovereignty, and the Right to Food and Nutrition Watch Consortium, which includes “Brot für die Welt” (Bread for the world), FoodFirst Information and Action Network (FIAN), and Interchurch Organisation for Development Cooperation (ICCO), among others.

The Alliance supports the concept of food sovereignty under the definition provided by La Vía Campesina (LVC), which originally proposed the idea at the 1996 World Food Summit. A group of activists and supporters came together to form the Working Group on the Food Crisis in 2008, a previous version of the Alliance, to address issues such as increasing food prices, global hunger, unequal food distribution and food insecurity. Part of this group were representatives from the National Family Farm Coalition, and members of the International Assessment of Agricultural Knowledge, Science and Technology for Development. After a meeting in Washington, DC in 2009, the Alliance was established to mobilize and educate US and international activists on the food crisis. The Alliance met at the United States Social Forum in 2010, and has been meeting annually ever since.\n\nThe Food Sovereignty Prize is awarded annually to grassroots activists working for a more democratic food system. Awarded by the US Food Sovereignty Alliance, the Food Sovereignty Prize was developed to oppose the World Food Prize, which was founded by “the father of the Green Revolution,” Norman Borlaug. The Prize challenges the idea that global hunger, poverty and suffering can be alleviated purely through promoting more agribusiness and aquaculture. Instead, the Prize advocates for those who work to eliminate unequal distribution of wealth and resources, and overturn destructive political, economic, and social policies to open better access to food to communities in need.\n\nThe Food Sovereignty Prize is awarded to groups who are active in four areas:\n\nPast honorees include:\n"}

Environmental law is increasingly a European and an international issue, due to the cross border issues of air and water pollution, and man made climate change.\n\nIn the common law, the primary protection was found in the tort of nuisance, but this only allowed for private actions for damages or injunctions if there was harm to land. Thus smells emanating from pig sties, strict liability against dumping rubbish, or damage from exploding dams. Private enforcement, however, was limited and found to be woefully inadequate to deal with major environmental threats, particularly threats to common resources. \n\n\nDuring the \"Great Stink\" of 1858, the dumping of sewerage into the River Thames began to smell so ghastly in the summer heat that Parliament had to be evacuated. The Metropolitan Commission of Sewers Act 1848 had allowed the Metropolitan Commission for Sewers to close cesspits around the city in an attempt to \"clean up\" but this simply led people to pollute the river. In 19 days, Parliament passed a further Act to build the London sewerage system. \n\n\nLondon also suffered from terrible air pollution, and this culminated in the \"Great Smog\" of 1952, which in turn triggered its on legislative response: the Clean Air Act 1956.

He was criticized for his subsequent denial of widespread famine (1932–1933) in the USSR, most particularly the mass starvation in Ukraine. Years later, there were calls to revoke his Pulitzer. In 1990, \"The New York Times\", which submitted his works for the prize in 1932, wrote that his later articles denying the famine constituted \"some of the worst reporting to appear in this newspaper.\"\n\nDuranty was born in a middle-class Merseyside family, the son of Emmeline (née Hutchins) and William Steel Duranty. His grandparents had moved to Birkenhead on the Wirral from the West Indies in 1842 and established a successful merchant business there in which his father worked. He studied at Harrow, one of Britain's most prestigious public schools, but a sudden collapse in the family business led to a transfer to Bedford College. Nevertheless, he then gained a scholarship to study at Emmanuel College, Cambridge, where he graduated with a first-class degree.\n\nAfter completing his education, Duranty moved to Paris. Duranty's biographer, Sally J. Taylor, said that Duranty met Aleister Crowley and participated in magic rituals with him during this period. According to Taylor, Duranty became involved in a relationship with Crowley's mistress Jane Cheron, and eventually married her. Crowley called Walter Duranty \"my old friend\" and quoted from Duranty's book \"I Write as I Please\" in his book \"Magick Without Tears\".\n\nDuring the Great War, Duranty first worked as a reporter for \"The New York Times\". A story Duranty filed about the Paris Peace Conference, 1919 gained him wider notice as a journalist. He then moved to Riga, the capital of Latvia, to cover events in the newly independent Baltic states.\n\nDuranty moved to the Soviet Union in 1921.\n\nOn holiday in France in 1924, Duranty's left leg was injured in a train wreck. After the operation, the surgeon discovered gangrene; and the leg was amputated. Once he had recovered, Duranty resumed his career as a journalist in the Soviet Union. During the New Economic Policy with its mixed economy, Duranty's articles from Moscow did not draw wide attention. It was after the advent of the first five-year plan (1928–1933), which aimed to transform Soviet industry and agriculture, that Duranty made his mark.\n\nIn 1929, he was granted an exclusive interview with Joseph Stalin that greatly enhanced his reputation as a journalist. Duranty was to remain in Moscow for twelve years, settling in the United States in 1934. Thereafter, he remained on retainer for \"The New York Times\", which required him to spend several months a year in Moscow. It was in this capacity that Duranty reported on the show trials of Stalin's political opponents in 1936–1938.\n\nIn the 1931 series of reports for which he received the 1932 Pulitzer Prize for Correspondence, Duranty argued that the Russian people were \"Asiatic\" in thought: they valued communal effort and required autocratic government. Individuality and private enterprise were alien concepts to the Russian people, which only led to social disruption and were unacceptable to them just as tyranny and Communism were unacceptable to the Western world.\n\nFailed attempts, since the time of Peter the Great, to apply Western ideals in Russia were a form of European colonialism, he wrote, that had been finally swept away by the 1917 Revolution. Vladimir Lenin and his New Economic Policy were both failures tainted by Western thought. Duranty felt that Stalin scrapped the New Economic Policy because he had no political competition. The famine in Ukraine demonstrated the lack of organized opposition to Stalin, because his position was never truly threatened by the catastrophe; Stalin's purges surely contributed to this political vacuum. Stalin succeeded in doing what Lenin could only attempt to do, i.e., he \"re-established a dictator of the imperial idea and put himself in charge\" by means of intimidation. \"Stalin didn't look upon himself as a dictator, but as a 'guardian of a sacred flame' that he called Stalinism for lack of a better name.\" Stalin's five-year plan was an attempt to effect a new way of life for the Russian people.\n\nDuranty argued that the Soviet Union's mentality in 1931 greatly differed from the perception created by Karl Marx's ideas. Duranty claimed: \"It would be more proper to refer to the principle present during the period of Stalin's reign as 'Stalinism'\", which Duranty viewed as a progression and integration of Marxism combined with Leninism. In one of the articles submitted for the Pulitzer Prize (\"Stalinism smashes foes in Marx's name\", 24 June 1931) Duranty gives his views of the Soviet actions in the countryside that eventually led to the famine.\n\nwhat is happening now to the Kulaks is leading to the same result—the kulaks who, under Leninism were an almost privileged class, encouraged to work and prosper (did not Bukharin then Leninism's chief spokesman, ... once say to the peasants, \"Enrich yourselves,\" that is, become kulaks better than—or a different class from—your fellows by individual, self—helping effort?) \"The liquidation of the kulak as a class\" runs the present slogan whose meaning in terms of reality is that 5,000,000 human beings, 1,000,000 families of the best and most energetic farmers are to be dispossessed, dispersed, demolished, to be literally melted or \"liquidated\" into the rising flood of classless proletarians.\n\nHere, when you get right down to it, is the supreme justification from the Bolshevik angle of the cruel and often bloody pressure upon \"the former People\" or class enemies from Czar to kulak. Where Marxism theorized Stalin acts. Marxism says, \"Eliminate class distinctions\" and Stalinism does so by the simple and effective process of destructions, as Tamerlane destroyed his enemies or the Hebrew prophet [Samuel] slew for the glory of Jehovah.\n\nDuranty sometimes claimed that individuals being sent to the labor camps in the Russian North, Siberia or Kazakhstan were given a choice between rejoining Soviet society or becoming underprivileged outsiders. However, he also said that, for those who could not accept the system, \"the final fate of such enemies is death\". Though describing the system as cruel, he said he has \"no brief for or against it, nor any purpose save to try to tell the truth\". He ends the article with the claim that the brutal collectivization campaign was motivated by the \"hope or promise of a subsequent raising up\" of Asian-minded masses in the Soviet Union which only history could judge.\n\nRather than just repeating the Stalinist viewpoint, Duranty often admitted the brutality of the Stalinist system then proceeded to both explain and defend why dictatorship or brutality were necessary. In addition, he repeated Soviet views as his own opinion, as if his 'observations' from Moscow had given him deeper insights into the country as a whole.\n\nDuranty's motivations have been hotly debated and his reporting is faulted for being too uncritical of the USSR, presenting Soviet propaganda as legitimate reporting.\n\nIn his praise of Joseph Stalin as an imperial, national, \"authentically Russian\" dictator to be compared to Ivan the Terrible, Duranty was expressing views similar to those of some White (Russian) émigrés during the same period, namely the Smenovekhovtsy movement, echoing still earlier hopes by the Eurasianism movement and the Mladorossi group currents in the 1920s. (Of course, Stalin was not Russian, but Georgian, with distant Ossetian ancestry — his paternal great-grandfather was an Ossetian—a fact that he himself downplayed during his lifetime.)\n\nIn 1933, Stalin rewarded this praise and appreciation by saying that Duranty tried \"to tell the truth about our country\".\n\nIn \"The New York Times\" on 31 March 1933, Walter Duranty denounced reports of a famine and, in particular, he attacked Gareth Jones, a British journalist who had witnessed the starving in Ukraine and issued a widely published press release about their plight two days earlier in Berlin. (Jones' release was itself immediately preceded by three unsigned articles describing the famine in the \"Manchester Guardian\".)\n\nUnder the title \"Russians Hungry, But Not Starving\" Duranty's article described the situation as follows:\nIn the middle of the diplomatic duel between Great Britain and the Soviet Union over the accused British engineers, there appears from a British source a big scare story in the American press about famine in the Soviet Union, with \"thousands already dead and millions menaced by death from starvation.\n\nThe \"diplomatic duel\" was a reference to the arrest of engineers from the Metropolitan-Vickers company who were working in the USSR. Accused with Soviet citizens of \"wrecking\" (sabotaging) the plant they were building, they were the subjects of one in a series of show trials presided over by Andrey Vyshinsky during the First Five Year Plan.\n\nFive months later (23 August 1933), in another \"New York Times\" article, Duranty wrote:\n\nAny report of a famine in Russia is today an exaggeration or malignant propaganda. The food shortage, however, which has affected the whole population in the last year and particularly in the grain-producing provinces — the Ukraine, North Caucasus [i.e. Kuban Region], and the Lower Volga — has, however, caused heavy loss of life.\n\nDuranty concluded \"it is conservative to suppose\" that, in certain provinces with a total population of over 40 million, mortality had \"at least trebled.\" The duel in the press over the famine stories did not damage esteem for Duranty. \"The Nation\" then described his reporting as \"the most enlightened, dispassionate dispatches from a great nation in the making which appeared in any newspaper in the world.\"\n\nFollowing sensitive negotiations in November 1933 that resulted in the establishment of relations between the U.S. and the U.S.S.R., a dinner was given for Soviet Foreign Minister Maxim Litvinov in New York City's Waldorf-Astoria Hotel. Each of the attendees' names was read in turn, politely applauded by the guests, until Duranty's. Whereupon, Alexander Woollcott wrote, \"the one really prolonged pandemonium was evoked ... Indeed, one quite got the impression that America, in a spasm of discernment, was recognizing both Russia and Walter Duranty.\"\n\nSally J. Taylor, author of the critical Duranty biography \"Stalin's Apologist\", argues that his reporting from the USSR was a key factor in U.S. President Franklin D. Roosevelt's 1933 decision to grant official recognition to the Soviet Union.\n\nIn 1934, Duranty left Moscow and visited the White House in the company of Soviet officials, including Litvinov. He continued as a Special Correspondent for \"The New York Times\" until 1940.\n\nHe wrote several books on the Soviet Union after 1940. His name was on a list maintained by writer George Orwell of those Orwell considered to be unsuitable as possible writers for the British Foreign Office's Information Research Department owing to the possibility of them being too sympathetic to communism or possibly paid communist agents.\n\nDuranty died in Orlando, Florida in 1957 and is interred at Greenwood Cemetery.\n\nDuranty was reporting at a time when opinions were strongly divided on the Soviet Union and its leadership.\n\nThe admission of the USSR to the League of Nations in 1934 was viewed optimistically by some. Others saw an inevitable confrontation between fascism and communism as requiring individuals to take one side or the other. After German invasion of the USSR, Joseph E. Davies, former U.S. Ambassador to the Soviet Union (1936–1938), wrote positively about \"Russia and its people in their gallant struggle to preserve the peace until ruthless aggression made war inevitable\". In the same book he referred to Stalin as a \"decent and clean-living\" man and \"a great leader.\"\n\nMany reporters of Duranty's time slanted their coverage in favour of the Soviet Union. Some drew a contrast with the capitalist world, sinking under the weight of the Great Depression; others wrote out of a true belief in Communism; some acted out of fear of being expelled from Moscow, which would result in a loss of livelihood. At home many of their editors found it hard to believe a state would deliberately starve millions of its own people. Duranty's reports for \"The New York Times\" were a source of much frustration for the paper's readers in 1932, because they directly contradicted the line taken on the paper's own editorial page.\n\nDuranty has been criticized for deferring to Stalin and the Soviet Union's official propaganda rather than reporting news, both when he was living in Moscow and later. For example, he later defended Stalin's Moscow Trials of 1938, which were staged to eliminate potential challengers to Stalin's authority.\n\nThe major controversy regarding his work remains his reporting on the great famine of 1932–33 that struck certain parts of the USSR after agriculture was forcibly and rapidly \"collectivised\". He published reports stating \"there is no famine or actual starvation nor is there likely to be\" and \"any report of a famine in Russia is today an exaggeration or malignant propaganda\". In Ukraine, the region most affected, this man-made disaster is today known as the Holodomor.\n\nSince the late 1960s, Duranty's work has come increasingly under fire for failing to report the famine. Robert Conquest was critical of Duranty's reporting in \"The Great Terror\" (1968), \"The Harvest of Sorrow\" (1986) and, most recently, in \"Reflections on a Ravaged Century\" (1990). Joseph Alsop and Andrew Stuttaford spoke out against Duranty during the Pulitzer Prize controversy. \"Lying was Duranty's stock in trade,\" commented Alsop. In his memoirs British journalist Malcolm Muggeridge, then \"The Manchester Guardian\"s correspondent in Moscow, talked of Duranty's \"persistent lying\" and elsewhere called him \"the greatest liar I ever knew.\".\n\nIt was clear, meanwhile, from Duranty's comments to others that he was fully aware of the scale of the calamity. In 1934 he privately reported to the British embassy in Moscow that as many as 10 million people may have died, directly or indirectly, from famine in the Soviet Union in the previous year.\n\nBoth British intelligence and American engineer Zara Witkin (1900–1940), who worked in the USSR from 1932 to 1934, confirmed that Duranty knowingly misrepresented information about the nature and scale of the famine.\n\nThere are some indications that Duranty's deliberate misdirection concerning the famine may have been the result of duress. Conquest believed Duranty was being blackmailed over his sexual proclivities.\n\nIn his 1944 book, Duranty speaks in a chastened tone about his 1932–34 reporting, but he offers only a Stalinist defense of it. He admits that people starved, including not just \"class enemies\" but also loyal communists, but he says that Stalin was forced to order the requisitions to equip the Red Army enough to deter an imminent Japanese invasion (a reprise of the Siberian Intervention of a decade earlier)—in other words, to save the Soviet Union from impending military doom, not because Stalin wanted to collectivize the population at gunpoint, on pain of death. Although it is likely that Stalin \"did\" expect a Japanese invasion (expecting foreign attacks all the time), historians today do not accept the view that it was his \"sole\" motivation and that Stalin did not intend any cruel and ruthless political dominance of the Soviet population. Of the notion that Stalin did intend the latter, Duranty said, \"What a misconception!\" But today that assertion of \"misconception\" is itself well established to be at best a self-delusion and at worst a knowing repetition of false Stalinist propaganda, the falsehood being demonstrable today in light of reams of evidence now publicly available (in the post–Secret Speech and post-Soviet eras) but not publicly available in 1944.\n\nThe concern over Duranty's reporting on the famine in Soviet Ukraine led to a move to posthumously and symbolically strip him of the Pulitzer Prize he received in 1932.\n\nIn response to \"Stalin's Apologist\" (1990), the critical biography by Sally J. Taylor, \"The New York Times\" assigned a member of its editorial board, Karl Meyer, to write a signed editorial about Duranty's work for the \"Times\". In a scathing piece, Meyer said (24 June 1990) that Duranty's articles were \"some of the worst reporting to appear in this newspaper.\" Duranty, Meyer said, had bet his career on Stalin's rise and \"strove to preserve it by ignoring or excusing Stalin's crimes.\" The Pulitzer Board in 1990 reconsidered the prize but decided to preserve it as awarded. Four years earlier, in a review of Robert Conquest's \"The Harvest of Sorrow\" (1986), former Moscow bureau reporter Craig Whitney wrote that Duranty effectively ignored the famine until it was almost over.\n\nIn 2003, following an international campaign by the Ukrainian Canadian Civil Liberties Association, the Pulitzer Board began a renewed inquiry, and \"The New York Times\" hired Mark von Hagen, professor of Russian history at Columbia University, to review Duranty's work as a whole. Von Hagen found Duranty's reports to be unbalanced and uncritical, and that they far too often gave voice to Stalinist propaganda. In comments to the press he stated, \"For the sake of \"The New York Times\" honor, they should take the prize away.\" The \"Times\" sent von Hagen's report to the Pulitzer Board and left it to the Board to take whatever action they considered appropriate. In a letter accompanying the report, \"The New York Times\" publisher Arthur Ochs Sulzberger, Jr. called Duranty's work \"slovenly\" and said it \"should have been recognized for what it was by his editors and by his Pulitzer judges seven decades ago.\"\n\nUltimately, Sig Gissler, administrator of the Pulitzer Prize board, declined to revoke the award. In a press release of November 21, 2003, he stated that with regard to the 13 articles by Duranty from 1931 submitted for the award \"there was not clear and convincing evidence of deliberate deception, the relevant standard in this case.\"\n\n\n\n\nEleven-part series in \"The New York Times\"\n\nTwo articles in \"The New York Times\" magazine\n\n\n\nin chronological order\n\n\n\n"}
