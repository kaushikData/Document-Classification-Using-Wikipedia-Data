Malaya's prime minister, Tunku Abdul Rahman and his government vigorously opposed the apartheid policies of South Africa and, with the support of Pakistan, India and Ghana, demanded that the issue be addressed by the Commonwealth. However, Macmillan insisted that the final communique could only include matters on which the leaders were unanimous. Ghana advised the meeting that it would be becoming a republic and South Africa advised that it would be holding a referendum on the issue. Ghana was advised that its continued membership in the Commonwealth as a republic was recognised, however, South Africa was advised that it would need to seek consent of other Commonwealth governments for its membership to continue.\n"}

A typical law school or bar exam question on real property might say:\n\nWhere more than one estate is needed to demonstrate a pointperhaps relating to a dispute over boundaries, easements or riparian rightsa second estate will usually be called Whiteacre, a third, Greenacre, and a fourth, Brownacre.\n\nJesse Dukeminier, author of one of the leading series of textbooks on property, traces the use of Blackacre and Whiteacre for this purpose to a 1628 treatise by Sir Edward Coke. Dukeminier suggests that the term might originate with references to colors associated with certain crops (\"peas and beans are black, corn and potatoes are white, hay is green\"), or with the means by which rents were to be paid, with black rents payable in produce and white rents in silver. A 1790 treatise by Francis Buller similarly uses these placeholder names, stating: \"If A. have Black Acre and C. have White Acre, and A. has a way over White Acre to Black Acre, and then purchases White Acre, the way will be extinct; and if A. afterwards enfeoff C. of White Acre without excepting the road, it is gone\".\n\nAn alternate theory is that the term arises from Civil War policy in which plots of plantation land given to recently emancipated African-American freedmen (freed slaves) during the Reconstruction period under Sherman's \"forty acres and a mule\" policy. Such plots were colloquially called \"Blackacres\". Since most of the freed slaves were illiterate, many were cheated out of their land through shady loan contracts with former plantation owners. These disputes, along with questions of the proper contractual entitlement of the slaves to the land in the first place, provided the basis for the development of modern American contract and property law and has come to refer to situations where there exists some contention or ambiguity surrounding the rightful owner or respective rights of the parties.\n\nIn various law journals and treatises in Louisiana, which uses a unique form of the civil law influenced by but not identical to the Napoleonic Code, authors have used the term \"arpent noir\" as a placeholder name for the purpose of discussing rights concerning immovables.\n\nBecause of its association with legal education, a number of legal publications and events utilize the name. For example, \"Blackacre\" was adopted as the name of the literary journal at the University of Texas School of Law. \"Blackacre\" is also the name of a journal at the University of Sydney Law School, published annually by the Sydney University Law Society, the name of the open-air courtyard and weekly student social at Vanderbilt Law School, and the name of a William Mitchell College of Law formal.\n\nThe Blackacre Nature Preserve and Historic Homestead in Kentucky was so named by the donor of the land, Macauley Smith, who had been a judge on the Kentucky Court of Appeals. In July 2010, a legal humor website wrote an article chronicling the foreclosure sale of Blackacre. A group of law students in Indianapolis founded a brewery named Black Acre Brewing Co. in late 2010 as a homage to their legal schooling. Monica Youn's 2016 book of poetry from Graywolf Press is titled \"Blackacre\", in reference to the legal concept (Youn has a law degree from Yale).\n\n"}

The Border service numbers around 170,000 active members, which includes the Russian maritime border guard units (i.e., the coast guard).\n\nOne can trace the origin of the Russian border service to 1571 and the work of Prince Mikhail Vorotynsky (died 1573) and his Great Abatis Border built along the southern boundaries of the Tsardom of Russia in the 16th century.\nIn 1782 the Empress Catherine II of Russia established Border Customs Guard units, originally manned by Russian Cossacks as well as by low-ranking cavalry troops. In 1810 General Mikhail Barklay de Tolly organized numerous border posts along the entire western Russian border, manned by 11 regiments of Don and Bug Cossacks . Within two years Russian Border Guards became the first to oppose Napoleon's invasion of Russia (June 1812). In 1832 Cossacks and cavalry were replaced by armed customs officials subordinate to the Ministry of Finance in peacetime (in wartime the border guards were automatically transferred to the army). In the same year the government of Emperor Nicholas I established a coast guard - originally to observe coasts of the Black Sea and of the Sea of Azov.\n\nCount Sergei Witte, the Russian Minister of Finance (1892-1903) in the government of Alexander III (reigned 1881-1894), reformed the service on 13 October 1893 into the Independent Border Guards Corps (IBGC - a para-military rather than a civilian organization) headed by an army general and reporting directly to the ministry.\n\nIn 1906 about 40,000 soldiers and officers served in the IBGC - maintaining the defence of the lengthy Imperial border. They served in 8 division-sized districts as well as in the Saint Petersburg headquarters unit.\n\nSoviet Border Troops, () were the militarized border guard of the Soviet Union, subordinated to its subsequently reorganized state security agency: first to \"Cheka\"/OGPU, then to NKVD/MGB and, finally, to KGB. Accordingly, they were known as NKVD Border Troops and KGB Border Troops (with Russian abbreviations - \"НКВД СССР\"/- \"КГБ СССР\" added on the end of official names). Unlike border guards of many other countries, Soviet Border Troops were a centralized force including also the maritime border guard units (i.e., a coast guard).\n\nFollowing the collapse of the Soviet Union, Federal Border Guard Service of Russia was created on December 30, 1993 as a separate government agency. The agency retained some old traditions, most notably the dark green-colored uniform and \"Border Guarder's Day\" (an official holiday commemorated by celebrations of ex-servicemen). First minister of FBS (Federal Border Service) was Andrei Nikolayev, young and outspoken general who later became deputy of the State Duma. Russian Border Guards were also stationed outside of Russia most notably in southern Tajikistan, in order to guard the border with Afghanistan, until summer 2005. On Afghan-Tajik border on many occasions they were engaged in heavy fighting with drug-traffickers and Islamic extremists. Armenia's closed border with Turkey and open border with Iran is also still guarded by the Russians. On March 11, 2003, Russian president Vladimir Putin changed the status of Border Guard Service from a separate agency into a branch of Russian Federal Security Service. The current head of Border Guard Service of Russia is General Vladimir Pronichev. Border Guard Service of Russia is tasked with a defence of the longest national border in the world.\n\nIn April 2012 Vladimir Pronichev announced that the country was planning to build 20 frontier posts in the Arctic region. Reasons for this development can be found in the increased abilities to explore hydrocarbon deposits in the north. It will also give Russia an ability to patrol and service the Northern Sea Route.\n\nIn July 2014 Ukraine opened a criminal case against the head of the Border Guard Service Vladimir Kulishov; he was accused of financing “illegal military groups” in Eastern Ukraine who at the time fought against the Ukrainian army.\n\nResponsibilities of Border Guard Service of Russia include:\n\n\n\nFPS Russia, the Federal Border Service (, Federal'naya Pogranichnaya Sluzhba), active from 30 December 1994 to 30 June 2003, was headed by a single centralized system, which included:\n\n\nChanges in the regional structure of the Border Service, instead of ten regional border (see the old structures FPS) for the new scheme includes regional offices of the border (in the federal districts) and 30 border offices.

It applies particularly to soldiers, police officers, workers who refuse to respect picket lines during a strike and basically anyone paid a wage who actively facilitates the \"status quo\". According to Barbara Ehrenreich: \"Class treason is an option at all socioeconomic levels: from the blue-collar man who becomes a security guard employed to harass striking workers, to the heirs of capitalist fortunes who become donors to left-wing causes\".\n\nIn Russia before and during the Russian Revolution, the Bolsheviks and other socialist revolutionary organizations used it to describe the Czarist Army and basically any working class citizen who directly opposed their notion of the \"dictatorship of the proletariat\". The term was later extended to include the Menshevik Russians and other supposedly counter-revolutionary socialist organizations under Joseph Stalin.\n\nThe motives behind becoming a traitor to one's class can include the necessity of survival (taking up whatever wage is available), the belief that the person is of a higher class and so has political views that work against the working class, the pressure of conformity, or a rejection of the view that society is divided up into antagonistic classes.\n\n"}

The English version was released on July 25, 2008, and has also been released in French, German, Spanish and Russian versions. The French version has been named Mission-Président.\n\nWhen starting a new game, players may choose between various scenarios, some of which have set objectives while others are more akin to a \"sandbox\" mode.\n\nSimilarly to other government simulation games like Democracy, the player assumes the role of the chief executive of their chosen nation such as the President of the United States of America or the Prime Minister of the United Kingdom. Unlike in the Democracy series the player may amend the constitution of their chosen state and run it as a dictatorship.\n\nThe game refers to the position of chief executive as \"Head of State\" which is not true for all states—for example, the President of the United States is the Head of State, but the British Prime Minister or German Chancellor are not—and in the game, the player plays as the chief executive. In many states there is a distinction between the Head of Government and the Head of State, with the Head of State often being a ceremonial president or monarch. There is also no distinction in the game between any upper and lower houses of the parliament.\n\nThere are also inaccuracies relating to nations in the game, as many nations are misrepresented. For example, the Finnish are inaccurately portrayed as being culturally Scandinavian, all Finnish have Swedish names when Swedish speakers only constitute 5.5% of the population. Other inaccuracies relate to the religion. Certain minority religions, such as the Baha'i faith in India, are not represented in the game, nor are pagans of any kind. There are also mistakes relating to ethnicity. For example, all the people of Kyrgyzstan, as opposed to a sizable minority, are represented as being Caucasian rather than east Asian and also all have Russian names. Similarly, most Filipinos have Indian names.\n\nThe game received mixed to negative reviews. Jason Ocampo of \"IGN\" remarked that the game was \"difficult to take as a serious simulation of global politics.\" A reviewer for GameZone stated that the game was \"a pretty hollow attempt to cash in on the recent Presidential elections.\"\n\n\n"}

Products that consumers buy will tend to be produced in the future. Products that do not sell as well as expected will receive fewer productive resources in the future. Effectively, according to this analogy, consumers are voting for \"winners\" and \"losers\" with their purchases. This argument was used to explain and justify market allocations of goods and services under the catchphrase \"consumer sovereignty\".\n\nConsumer boycotts have from time to time been proposed as a useful approach to change producers' behavior. The goals of selective boycotts, or dollar voting, have been diverse, and have included a desire to see decreased corporate revenues, removal of key executives, or reputational damage.\n\nThe modern idea of dollar voting can be traced back to its development by James Buchanan in \"Individual Choice in Voting and the Market\". As a public choice theorist, Buchanan equated economic participation by the individual as a form of pure democracy. Also known as political consumerism, dollar voting’s history in the United States can be followed back to the American Revolution, when colonists boycotted several British products in protest of taxation without representation.\n\nDollar voting has been increasingly thought to be a useful tool in changing producers' behavior. If voters feel disenfranchised politically, they may turn to using their spending power to influence politics and the economy. Consumers aiming to use dollar voting ultimately hope to impact society’s values and use of resources.\n\nThe idea of dollar voting has faced criticism for its class implications. In modern America, dollar voting is often seen being used by middle and upper middle class consumers who spend their money at local farmers markets, community agricultural programs, and the preparation of “slow food”. These purchases do not affect low-income producers and consumer in the food market. Moreover, dollar voting has been criticized as a form of conspicuous consumption for the well-off, serving more as a display of morality than of actual consumer preference.\n\nDollar voting has also been criticized for being a sort of consumer vigilantism, as while most economists and economic philosophers accept that consumers have a right to their personal moral choices in the market, large-scale movements to influence consumer spending could have potentially dangerous implications.\n\nAs more consumer activists find ways to use the power of their dollar, efforts at encouraging corporations and firms to act in environmentally friendly ways have become popular. However, it is unclear whether or not a firm that creates negative environmental externalities will legitimately change its method of production to satisfy such desires. It also has the potential to move citizens away from law making efforts that check unmitigated self interest in both firms and consumers, and instead shifts this responsibility almost completely over to the market.\n\n"}

Ex-Workers Collective and its allies. DJV was publicly announced at the National Conference on Organized Resistance (NCOR) in 2004 and was an activist-orientated propaganda initiative focused on demonstrating the effectiveness of direct democracy and direct action over political representation. The campaign was interpreted by some as a counterpoint to Punkvoter and other anti-Bush voter participation efforts. However, organizers initially conceived of the campaign without knowledge of the Punkvoter campaign.\n\nAccording to one of the 20,000 voter's guides distributed by those involved with the campaign before the 2004 presidential election, \"Voting for people to represent your interests is the least efficient and effective means of applying political power. The alternative, broadly speaking, is acting directly to represent your interests yourself.\" Unlike previous projects critical of electoral politics, DJV deliberately avoided the voting vs. abstention argument that is common in the anarchist milieu.\n\nThe campaign was characterised by \"The American Prospect\" as \"a clear inheritor of the spirit of 1968\", citing its willingness to celebrate in the street, regardless of the outcome. In the election's aftermath, Don't Just Vote, Get Active endorsed the Anarchist Resistance \"call to action\" against the 2005 presidential inauguration.\n\nThe campaign was criticised in \"Green Anarchy\" for its credulous if qualified endorsement of voting, accusing CrimethInc. of offering \"a soothing middle ground\" instead of outright rejecting statist mechanisms of control. In a reworking of the campaign's slogan, the magazine exhorted readers \"don't JUST be active, WAKE THE FUCK UP!\" Mark Andersen, in \"All the Power: Revolution without Illusion\" praised the initially empowering message of the campaign but criticised it for \"a slide toward insular subcultural politics\", drawing note to the recurrent phrases \"tyranny of the majority\", \"living without permission\" and \"autonomy\" which he claimed evinced an \"esoteric, self-referential approach\" which would turn acolytes into \"radical navel-gazers\".\n\n\n\n"}

Organizations engage in employee monitoring for different reasons such as to track performance, to avoid legal liability, to protect trade secrets, and to address other security concerns. This practice may impact employee satisfaction due to its impact on the privacy of the employees. Among organizations, the extent and methods of employee monitoring differ.[1]\n\nDue to the use of company computers, telephones, workspaces, and software, employers can have access to the daily activities of their employees. These devices are used to monitor the organizations' employees. Common methods of monitoring include software monitoring, telephone tapping, video surveillance, email monitoring, and location monitoring.\n\nSoftware monitoring can occur if employees use company computers for their work, companies often utilize employee monitoring software that allows them to track what their employees are doing on the computers. Such as, what the speed of typing is, what mistakes are made, what applications were used, and what specific keys were pressed.\n\nTelephone tapping can be used to recover employees' phone call details and conversations. These can be recorded during monitoring. The number of calls, the duration of each call, and the idle time between calls, can all go into an automatic log for analysis by the company.\n\nVideo surveillance can provide video feed of employee activities that are passed through to a central location where they are monitored live by another person. These can be recorded and stored for future reference which some believe is the most accurate way to monitor employees. \"This is a benefit because it provides an unbiased method of performance evaluation and prevents the interference of a manager's feelings in an employee's review (Mishra and Crampton, 1998).\" Management can review the performance of an employee by checking the surveillance to detect and potentially prevent problems.[1]\n\nEmail monitoring gives employers the ability to look at email messages sent or received by their employees. Emails can be viewed and recovered even if they had been previously deleted. In the United States, the Electronic Communications Privacy Act provides some privacy protections regarding monitoring of employees' email messages and other electronic communications. See Electronic Communications Privacy Act § Employee Privacy.\n\nLocation monitoring can occur and be used for employees that do not work in a static location. Supervisors may choose to track their location. Common examples of companies that use location monitoring are delivery and transportation industries. In some of these cases, the employee monitoring is incidental as the location is tracked for other purposes, that can help improve customer satisfaction. Employees' phone call details and conversations can be recorded during monitoring. The number of calls, the duration of each call, and the idle time between calls, can all go into an automatic log for analysis by the company.\n\nKey logging, or keystroke logging, is a process that records the keys a user is typing on the keyboard in order. These programs can also capture screenshots when triggered by predefined keywords. Some see it as violating workplace privacy and it's also notorious for being used with malicious intent. Loggers collect and store passwords, bank account information, private messages, credit card numbers, PIN numbers, and usernames. \nEmployee monitoring often is in conflict with employees' privacy. Monitoring often collects work-related activities, but it can also collect employee's personal information that is not linked to their work. Monitoring in the workplace may put employers and employees at odds because both sides are trying to protect personal interests. Employees want to maintain their privacy while employers want to ensure company resources aren't misused. In any case, companies can maintain ethical monitoring policies by avoiding indiscriminate monitoring of employees' activities. The employee needs to understand what is expected of them while the employer needs to establish that rule.\n\nWith employee monitoring, there are many guidelines that one must follow and put in place to protect the company and the individual. Some following cases are ones that have shaped the certain rules and regulations that are in effect today. For instance, in Canada, it is illegal to perform invasive monitoring, such as reading an employee's emails, unless it can be shown that it is a necessary precaution and there are no other alternatives. In Maryland, everyone in the conversation must give consent before the conversation can be recorded. The state of California requires that the monitored conversations have a beep at certain intervals or there must be a message informing the caller that the conversations may be recorded. However, this does not inform the company representative which calls are being recorded. Other states, including Connecticut, New York, Pennsylvania, Colorado and New Jersey have laws relating to when a conversation can be recorded. \"Lawyers generally advise that one way for businesses to avoid liability for monitoring employees’ online activities is to take all necessary steps to eliminate any reasonable expectation of privacy that employees may have concerning their use of company email and other communications systems.\" Businesses makes employee monitoring a known tool that supervisors use to avoid any potential legal issues that may arise. They will announce this during new hire orientation, in a staff meeting, or even in a workplace contract that employees sign either at the time of hire or after a form of misconduct.\n\nBusinesses use employee monitoring for various reasons. The follow is a list that includes, but is not limited to:\n\n\nAccording to Computer Monitoring: The Hidden War Of Control,\"The employer of today has the ability and legal right to read e-mail, review files stored on a company computer, examine computer usage, and track individual employee computer activities. The idea of anonymous actions is an illusion. Every action between a network and the computers connected to it can be tracked. Every action by an individual worker on a computer can be tracked, analyzed and used against the employee. The protections and freedoms guaranteed by the U.S. Constitution and Bill of Rights are there to protect the individual from the Government and do not generally apply to the normal employee/employer relationship.\" To benefit the business, employers have the ability to monitor employees whenever they feel is necessary.\n\nIn January 2016, European Court of Human Rights issued a landmark ruling in the case of Bărbulescu v Romania (61496/08) regarding monitoring of employees’ computers. The employee Mr. Bărbulescu accused the employer of violating his rights to ‘private life’ and ‘correspondence’ set in the Article 8 of the European Convention on Human Rights.\nBut the Court stated that the employer had every right to monitor the employee’s computer in this case due to the fact that such monitoring was implemented to ensure that there is no breach of company policy. This historic ruling has confirmed that it is not unreasonable for employers to monitor their employees’ computer activity and such monitoring does not violate their human rights.\n\nA year later, in July 2017, German court also ruled that computer monitoring of employees is reasonable but the use of keylogging software is excessive.\n\nEmployee monitoring software developers warn that in each case it is still recommended to advise a legal representative and the employees should give a written agreement with such monitoring Majority of instances are a case by case situation and is hard to treat all the issues and problems as one. With the ever growing laws, employers shape their guidelines around the new rules and regulations that are formed in court cases.\n\nEmployee Monitoring can be used to monitor the safety and productivity of the employees but it also may help businesses financially. From the dishonest unethical employee who steals time and money from the business to the redefining of unprofitable processes in monitoring employee actions, employee monitoring allows for the growth of financial profits from a small investment. The monitoring of employees can help in the protection of employees and it can help as protection in litigation by employees for job-related issues such as failing to perform, illegal activities and harassment claims. According to the American Management Association, almost half (48%) of the companies surveyed use video monitoring to counter theft, violence, and sabotage. Only 7% use video surveillance to track employees' on-the-job performance. Most employers notify employees of anti-theft video surveillance (78%) and performance-related video monitoring (89%), (Retrieved from the article The Latest on Workplace Monitoring and Surveillance on humanresources.about.com) In an article in \"Labour Economics\", it has been argued that forbidding employers to track employees' on-the-job performance can make economic sense according to efficiency wage theory, while surveillance to prevent illegal activities should be allowed.\n\nAn indirect way that companies can be affected financially through employee monitoring is that they can be sure they are billing clients correctly. According to \"Business 2 Community\", inaccurately billing clients is very possible because of the human error. These inaccuracies can cause a dispute between a company and a client which could eventually lead to the client terminating its business with the company. This sort of termination will not only hurt the company's revenue stream but also its reputation with other clients or potential clients. The suggested solution to this problem is a time tracking software to correctly monitor the number of hours a client spends with an employee. \n\nJohnathan Yerby said, \"The enormity of potential productivity loses, as reported by Court (2004), is approximately one million dollars\nannually for a company with 500 employees surfing the Internet for just a half hour a day.\" Not only does employee monitoring prevent theft of money and resources, but it also prevents theft of time and to make sure people are doing what they are supposed to be doing in the workplace. This is used a lot during the Holidays with online shopping, as well as during March Madness. Employees will spend their time using their work time for personal uses and employee monitoring helps regulate this.\n\n"}

The group carried out an armed struggle against enslavement.\n\nDuring the 1940s, a group of civilians volunteered to fight the British control of Egyptian land around the Suez Canal. The British had deployed military bases along the coast of the Suez Canal under the claim of protection. Many Egyptians viewed this as an invasion against their sovereign power over their country. While the Egyptian government didn't refuse the action, the people's leaders organized groups of Fedayeen who were trained to combat and kill British soldiers everywhere in Egypt, including the military bases. Those groups were viewed very highly among the Egyptian population. \n\nIn 1951 \"mobs of \"irregular self-sacrificers, or fedayeen\" some \"armed by the Muslim Brotherhood\", attacked the British military base defending the Suez Canal Zone.\n\nKnown by the same name, they operated inside the capital city, Asmara, during the last 15–20 years of the armed struggle in Eritrea against Ethiopia. They operated secretly and eliminated people who were considered dangerous to the struggle to free Eritrea.\n\nTwo very different groups used the name Fedayeen in recent Iranian history. Fadayan-e Islam has been described as \"one of the first real Islamic fundamentalist organizations in the Muslim world\". It was founded by Navab Safavi in 1946 for the purpose of demanding strict application of the sharia and assassinating those it believed to be apostates and enemies of Islam. After several successful assassinations it was suppressed in 1956 and several leading members were executed.\n\nA Marxist-leaning activist group known as the Fedayeen (Fedayân in Persian language) was founded in 1971 and based in Tehran. Operating between 1971 and 1983, the Fedayeen carried out a number of political assassinations in the course of the struggle against the Shah, after which the group was suppressed.\n\nIn 1979 the Iranian People's Fedâi Guerrillas split from the Organization of Iranian People's Fedaian (Majority).\n\nBeginning in 1995, Iraq established a paramilitary group known as the Fedayeen Saddam, loyal to the then president Saddam Hussein and the Ba'athist government. The name was chosen to imply a connection with the Palestinian Fedayeen. In July 2003, personnel records for the Fedayeen organization in Iraq were discovered in the basement of the former Fedayeen headquarters in east Baghdad near the Rasheed Air Base. At the time of the discovery, an Iraqi political party occupied the building; after an extensive cataloging process, an operation was conducted in Baghdad resulting in several individuals being detained.\n\nPalestinian fedayeen are militants of a nationalist orientation from among the Palestinian people. The fedayeen made efforts to infiltrate territory in Israel in order to strike military as well as civilian targets in the aftermath of the 1948 Arab–Israeli War.\n\nMembers of these groups were living in the Gaza Strip and the West Bank or in neighboring Lebanon and Syria. Prior to Israel's seizure of the West Bank and Gaza Strip in the Six-Day War, these areas, originally destined for a Palestinian state, were under Jordanian or Egyptian occupation, respectively. After Israel's Operation Black Arrow in 1955, the Palestinian fedayeen were incorporated into an Egyptian army unit.\n\nDuring this time (1948 – c. 1980), the word entered international usage and was frequently used in the Arab media as a synonym for great militancy. In the Israeli Hebrew press of this time the term ( \"fada'iun\") had highly negative connotations and was associated with terrorism. Since the mid-1960s and the rise of more organized and specific militant groups, such as the Palestine Liberation Organization, the word has fallen out of usage, but not in the historical context.\n\nWithin the context of Turkish history, the term \"fedailer\" is often associated with the Late Ottoman or Early Republican irregular forces, known as: Kuva-yi Milliye.\n\n\n\nDerives from the word \"fidāʼ\", which means redemption. Literally, someone who redeems himself by risking or sacrificing his life. The pronunciation varies for the first vowel, for example , hence the transcription difference.\n\n"}

{"id": "644054", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=644054", "title": "General practice", "text": "General practice\n\nGeneral practice is the name given in the United Kingdom to the service provided by General practitioners. In other countries similar services may be described as family medicine or primary care. The term Primary Care in the UK may also include services provided by community pharmacy, optometrist, dental surgery and community hearing care providers. The balance of care between primary care and secondary care - which usually refers to hospital based services - varies from place to place, and with time. In many countries there are initiatives to move services out of hospitals into the community, in the expectation that this will save money and be more convenient.\n\nA group of 15 doctors based in Birmingham have set up a social enterprise company - Pathfinder Healthcare - which plans to build eight primary health centres in India on the British model of general practice. According to Dr Niti Pall, primary health care is very poorly developed in India. These centres will be run commercially. Patients will be charged 200 to 300 Rupees for an initial consultation, and prescribed only generic drugs, dispensed from attached pharmacies.\n\nIn Ireland there are about 2,500 General Practitioners working in group practices, primary care centres, single practices and health centres.\n\nThe pattern of services in the UK was largely established by the National Insurance Act 1911 which established the list system which came from the friendly societies across the country. Every patient was entitled to be on the list, or panel of a general practitioner. In 1911 that only applied to those who paid National insurance contributions. In 1938 43% of the adult population was covered by a panel doctor. When the National Health Service was established in 1948 this extended to the whole population. The practice would be responsible for the patient record which was kept in a \"Lloyd George envelope\" and would be transferred if necessary to another practice if the patient changed practice. In the UK, unlike many other countries, patients do not normally have direct access to hospital consultants and the GP controls access to secondary care. Practices were generally small, often single handed, operating from the doctor's home and often with the doctor's wife acting as a receptionist.\nIn 1953, general practitioners were estimated to be making between 12 and 30 home visits each day and seeing between 15 and 50 patients in their surgeries.\n\nServices are provided under the General Medical Services Contract, which is regularly revised.\n\nThe GP Forward View, published by NHS England in 2016 promised £2.4 billion (14%) real-terms increase in the budget for general practice. Jeremy Hunt pledged to increase the number of doctors working in general practice by 5,000. There are 3,250 trainee places available in 2017. The GP Career Plus scheme is intended to retain GPs aged over 55 in the profession by providing flexible roles such as providing cover, carrying out specific work such as managing long-term conditions, or doing home visits. In July Simon Stevens announced a programme designed to recruit around 2,000 GPs from the EU and possibly New Zealand and Australia. According to NHS Improvement a 1% deterioration in access to general practice can produce a 10% deterioration in emergency department figures.\n\nGPs are increasingly employing pharmacists to manage the increasingly complex medication regimes of an aging population. In 2017 more than 1,061 practices were employing pharmacists, following the rollout of NHS England’s Clinical Pharmacists in General Practice programme. There are also moves to employ care navigators, sometimes an enhanced role for a receptionist, to direct patients to different services such as pharmacy and physiotherapy if a doctor is not needed. In September 2017 270 trained care navigators covering 64,000 patients had been employed across Wakefield. It was estimated that they had saved 930 GP hours over a 10-month trial.\n\nFour NHS trusts: Northumbria Healthcare NHS Foundation Trust; Yeovil District Hospital NHS Foundation Trust; Royal Wolverhampton NHS Trust; and Southern Health NHS Foundation Trust have taken over multiple GP practices in the interests of integration.\n\n599 GP practices closed between 2010–11 and 2014–15, while 91 opened and average practice list size increased from 6,610 to 7,171. In 2016 there were 7,613 practices in England, 958 in Scotland, 454 in Wales and 349 in Northern Ireland. There were 7435 practices in England and the average practice list size in June 2017 was 7,860. There were 1.35 million patients over 85. There has been a great deal of consolidation into larger practices, especially in England. Lakeside Healthcare was the largest practice in England in 2014, with 62 partners and more than 100,000 patients. Maintaining general practices in isolated communities has become very challenging, and calls on very different skills and behaviour from that required in large practices where there is increasing specialisation. By 1 October 2018, 47 GP practices in England had a list size of 30,000 or more and the average list size had reached 8,420.\n\nGP Federations have become popular among English General practitioners.\n\nAccording to the Local Government Association 57 million GP consultations in England in 2015 were for minor conditions and illnesses, 5.2 million of them for blocked noses. According to the King's Fund between 2014 and 2017 the umber of telephone and face-to-face contacts between patients and GPs rose by 7.5% although GP numbers have stagnated. The mean consultation length in the UK has increased steadily over time from around 5 mins in the 1950's to around 9·22 min in 2013-2014. This is shorter than the mean consultation length in a number of other developed countries around the world.\n\nThe proportion of patients in England waiting longer than seven days to see a GP has risen from 12.8% in 2012 to 20% in 2017.\n\nCommercial providers are rare in the UK but a private GP service was established at Poole Road Medical Centre in Bournemouth in 2017 where patients can pay to skip waiting lists to see a doctor.\n\nGP at Hand, an online service using Babylon Health's app, was launched in November 2017 by the Lillie Road Health Centre, a conventional GP practice in west London. It recruited 7000 new patients in its first month, of which 89.6% were between 20 and 45 years old. The service was widely criticised by GPs for cherry picking. Patients with long term medical conditions or who might need home visits were actively discouraged from joining the service. Richard Vautrey warned that it risked 'undermining the quality and continuity of care and further fragmenting the service provided to the public'.\n\n85% of patients rate their overall experience of primary care as good in 2016, but practices run by limited companies operating on APMS contracts (a small minority) performed worse on four out of five key indicators - frequency of consulting a preferred doctor, ability to get a convenient appointment, rating of doctor communication skills, ease of contacting the practice by telephone and overall experience.\n\nThere have been particularly acute problems in general practice in Northern Ireland as it has proved very difficult to recruit doctors in rural practices. The British Medical Association collected undated resignation letters in 2017 from GPs who threatened to leave the NHS and charge consultation fees. They demanded increased funding, more recruitment and improved computer systems.\n\nA new GP contract was announced in June 2018 by the Northern Ireland Department of Health. It included funding for practice-based pharmacists, an extra £1 million for increased indemnity costs, £1.8 million because of population growth, and £1.5 million for premises upgrades.\n"}

He is the leader of the Media Action Network for Asian Americans, which he co-founded in 1992. He is also a contributing columnist for the \"Rafu Shimpo\", and debates publicly on Asian American issues. During the 1980s, Aoki was part of the production staff for the \"American Top 40\" radio program.\n\nIn July 2001, Aoki became embroiled in a public controversy stemming from his objection to a joke told by comedian Sarah Silverman, which involved her use of the ethnic slur \"chink\", in an interview on the July 11, 2001 episode of \"Late Night with Conan O'Brien\".\n\nIn the interview, Silverman explained that a friend had advised her on how to avoid jury duty by writing a racial slur on the selection form, \"something really inappropriate, like, 'I hate chinks'.\" However, Silverman said that she ultimately decided that she did not want to be thought of as a racist and instead wrote, \"I \"love\" chinks.\" The Associated Press quoted Aoki: \"There is no excuse for something like this to have made the air. The term is the most offensive possible reference to a person of Chinese descent.\" NBC and Conan O'Brien issued an apology, but Silverman did not, insisting later on the July 26, 2001 episode of \"Politically Incorrect\" that she did not believe that Aoki was genuinely offended, but exploiting the opportunity for publicity.\n\nSilverman and Aoki later appeared together on the August 22, 2001 episode of \"Politically Incorrect,\" along with host Bill Maher and panelists David Spade and Anne-Marie Johnson, the latter of whom was chair of the Screen Actors Guild Ethnic Employment Opportunity Committee. After Silverman repeated the joke for exposition's sake, she opined that it made an implicit statement about the wrongness of racism, rather than legitimizing it. Johnson, however, questioned the humor in the joke, and Aoki opined that such slurs should not be used in an off-the-cuff manner because it legitimized their use, and that use of the word \"chink\" was no better than the use of the word \"nigger\". Aoki, while acknowledging that satire was a legitimate practice, asserted that Silverman's execution of it was not successful because it ran the risk that people would assume she actually subscribed to the racist viewpoint of her character.\n\nIn July 2003 Media Action Network protested the British program \"Banzai\", which is produced by Channel 4. Following the first U.S. broadcast of the series on the Fox Network on July 13, 2003, the Media Action Network accused the program, a spoof betting show that parodies Japanese game shows, of employing demeaning stereotypes of Asians. About 20 members of the group carried signs and shouted slogans outside a presentation by the Fox network to TV critics in Hollywood. Aoki commented, \"This is like an Asian minstrel show. Can you imagine the black version of Banzai?\" Fox spokesman Scott Grogin responded by saying, \"We've received an entire range of comments on the show, both pro and con\", and that as a satire, the show should be viewed as \"tongue-in-cheek\". According to Aoki, in discussions with the MANAA, Fox offered to include a disclaimer at the beginning of the show, but Aoki indicated that this would not assuage the MANAA, who wished the program not be broadcast at all.\n\n"}

Framework-based gender analysis has great importance in helping policy makers understand the economic case for allocating development resources to women as well as men.\n\nThe framework has its origins in 1980 with a request to Harvard University for Women In Development (WID) training from the World Bank. James Austin, who was well known for case-method training at Harvard, led a team with three women experienced in WID work: Catherine Overholt, Mary Anderson and Kathleen Cloud. These became known as the \"Harvard Team\".\nThe framework was elaborated by the Harvard Institute for International Development in collaboration with the WID office of USAID, and was first described in 1984 by Catherine Overholt and others. It was one of the earliest of such frameworks.\nThe starting point for the framework was the assumption that it makes economic sense for development aid projects to allocate resources to women as well as men, which will make development more efficient – a position named the “efficiency approach\".\n\nThe Framework for People Oriented Planning in Refugee Situations, more often called the People-Oriented Planning Framework, or POP, is a framework based on the Harvard Framework that tries to overcome some of its initial weaknesses, and is designed for use in emergency situations. POP was developed for the United Nations High Commission for Refugees.\nOther frameworks include Caroline Moser's \"Gender Planning Framework\", Naila Kabeer's \"Social Relations Framework\" and the \"Womens Empowerment Framework\".\n\nThe Harvard Analytical Framework is used to collect information from the community and from households. \nIt describes who does each activity, who has access and control of resources and the influences on gender roles.\nThe \"Activity Profile\" answers the question \"Who does what?\" for all relevant productive and reproductive tasks.\nThe \"Access and Control Profile\" identifies the resources used in the tasks identified in the \"Activity Profile\", and defines who has access to these resources and who controls their use. It also identifies the benefits that are realized from each activity, and who has access to and control over these benefits. The final \"Influencing factors\" section identifies factors that cause the differences of roles of each gender identified in the two profiles. These may indicate areas where there is opportunity to change gender roles.\nA project using the framework will have identification, design, implementation and evaluation stages. The framework also provides a series of checklists, questions to be asked at each stage.\n\nA more complete description of the framework is given in \"A Case Book: Gender Roles in Development Projects\" edited by Catherine Overholt, Mary B. Anderson, Kathleen Cloud, James E. Austin, published by Kumariyan Press in 1985.\n\nBeing neutral and fact-oriented, the framework is useful in starting discussion on gender-related issues with people who otherwise resist thinking about the balance of power between men and women. It is also useful in presenting information to people who tend to see decisions in economic terms.\nThe framework applies best to projects addressing agricultural or rural based communities, or that are seeking poverty reduction through implementing a sustainable livelihood.\n\nThe Harvard Framework focuses on projects rather than programs, and on efficiency rather than effectiveness. It does not help identify strategic gender needs and gives no guidance on changing gender inequalities.\nThe framework assumes that gender needs should be addressed for the sake of economic efficiency, and gives less importance to the concepts of equity, power relations or decision-making processes.\nThe top-down check-box approach leads to simplification, ignoring the subjects' analysis of their situation and ignoring factors such as race, class, ethnicity and other types of relationships, essential in progressing efficiency itself.\n"}

Since 2007, comprehensive counts have been performed every other year in week six (early February). The latest, from 2017, counted 6,635 homeless people in Denmark. The total number of people experiencing homelessness at some point in 2017 was estimated at 13,000, while earlier estimates have placed it between 10,000 and 15,000. Roughly half the homeless are in the Capital Region. When compared to many other countries, such as the United States, the rate of Denmark's homeless is significantly lower, which has been linked to the relatively comprehensive welfare system.\n\nThe number of homeless people in Denmark has risen in recent decades, but this has been most pronounced in people that are between 18 and 29 years old (although 30 to 59 years old remains the largest age group, at 70%), women (although men remains the largest group, at 75%) and immigrants (although Danish citizens remain the largest group). Among the foreign, a high percentage are Eastern or Southern European men that seek work in Denmark. Many of these only stay in Denmark during the summer, returning to their respective countries during the relatively cold Danish winter.\n\nBased on the comprehensive count in February 2017, roughly one-tenth of homeless people in Denmark are \"street sleepers\", with the remaining sleeping in the homes of friends/family, in hotels/hostels, in shelters or alike. The number of street sleepers is higher during the summer, and homeless foreigners are overrepresented among them. Among homeless in Denmark, the primary issue is psychiatric disease in 36% (24% receive treatment), drug addiction in 27% (17% receive treatment) and alcohol addiction in 23% (9% receive treatment). Overall it is estimated that more than half of all homeless people have mental health issues. Compared to many other countries such as the United States, a higher percentage of Denmark's homeless have mental health issues or substance abuse, as countries with weaker welfare systems tend to have higher homeless rates but the homeless will more likely to include from a wide range of groups.\n\nThe government of Denmark's approach to homelessness include commissioning national surveys on homelessness during the last decade that allow for direct comparison between Denmark, Norway and Sweden. The three countries have very similar definitions of homelessness, with minor variations.\n\n"}

{"id": "1093604", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1093604", "title": "International humanitarian law", "text": "International humanitarian law\n\nInternational humanitarian law (IHL) is the law that regulates the conduct of war (\"jus in bello\"). It is that branch of international law which seeks to limit the effects of armed conflict by protecting persons who are not participating in hostilities, and by restricting and regulating the means and methods of warfare available to combatants.\n\nIHL is inspired by considerations of humanity and the mitigation of human suffering. \"It comprises a set of rules, established by treaty or custom, that seeks to protect persons and property/objects that are (or may be) affected by armed conflict and limits the rights of parties to a conflict to use methods and means of warfare of their choice\". It includes \"the Geneva Conventions and the Hague Conventions, as well as subsequent treaties, case law, and customary international law\". It defines the conduct and responsibilities of belligerent nations, neutral nations, and individuals engaged in warfare, in relation to each other and to \"protected persons\", usually meaning non-combatants. It is designed to balance humanitarian concerns and military necessity, and subjects warfare to the rule of law by limiting its destructive effect and mitigating human suffering.\n\nSerious violations of international humanitarian law are called war crimes. International humanitarian law, \"jus in bello\", regulates the conduct of forces when engaged in war or armed conflict. It is distinct from \"jus ad bellum\" which regulates the conduct of engaging in war or armed conflict and includes crimes against peace and of war of aggression. Together the \"jus in bello\" and \"jus ad bellum\" comprise the two strands of the laws of war governing all aspects of international armed conflicts.\n\nThe law is mandatory for nations bound by the appropriate treaties. There are also other customary unwritten rules of war, many of which were explored at the Nuremberg War Trials. By extension, they also define both the \"permissive\" rights of these powers as well as \"prohibitions\" on their conduct when dealing with irregular forces and non-signatories.\n\nInternational humanitarian law operates on a strict division between rules applicable in international armed conflict and internal armed conflict. This dichotomy is widely criticized.\n\nThe relationship between international human rights law and international humanitarian law is disputed among international law scholars. This discussion forms part of a larger discussion on fragmentation of international law. While pluralist scholars conceive international human rights law as being distinct from international humanitarian law, proponents of the constitutionalist approach regard the latter as a subset of the former. In a nutshell, those who favor separate, self-contained regimes emphasize the differences in applicability; international humanitarian law applies only during armed conflict. On the other hand, a more systemic perspective explains that international humanitarian law represents a function of international human rights law; it includes general norms that apply to everyone at all time as well as specialized norms which apply to certain situations such as armed conflict and military occupation (i.e., IHL) or to certain groups of people including refugees (e.g., the 1951 Refugee Convention), children (the 1989 Convention on the Rights of the Child), and prisoners of war (the 1949 Third Geneva Convention).\n\nDemocracies are likely to protect the rights of all individuals within their territorial jurisdiction.\n\nModern international humanitarian law is made up of two historical streams:\n\nThe two streams take their names from a number of international conferences which drew up treaties relating to war and conflict, in particular the Hague Conventions of 1899 and 1907, and the Geneva Conventions, the first which was drawn up in 1863. Both deal with \"jus in bello\", which deals with the question of whether certain practices are acceptable during armed conflict.\n\nThe Law of The Hague, or the laws of war proper, \"determines the rights and duties of belligerents in the conduct of operations and limits the choice of means in doing harm\". In particular, it concerns itself with\n\nSystematic attempts to limit the savagery of warfare only began to develop in the 19th century. Such concerns were able to build on the changing view of warfare by states influenced by the Age of Enlightenment. The purpose of warfare was to overcome the enemy state, which could be done by disabling the enemy combatants. Thus, \"the distinction between combatants and civilians, the requirement that wounded and captured enemy combatants must be treated humanely, and that quarter must be given, some of the pillars of modern humanitarian law, all follow from this principle\".\n\nThe massacre of civilians in the midst of armed conflict has a long and dark history. Selected examples include\n\nto name only a few examples drawn from a long list in history. Fritz Munch sums up historical military practice before 1800: \"The essential points seem to be these: In battle and in towns taken by force, combatants and non-combatants were killed and property was destroyed or looted.\" In the 17th century, the Dutch jurist Hugo Grotius, widely regarded as the founder or father of public international law, wrote that \"wars, for the attainment of their objects, it cannot be denied, must employ force and terror as their most proper agents\".\n\nEven in the midst of the carnage of history, however, there have been frequent expressions and invocation of humanitarian norms for the protection of the victims of armed conflicts: the wounded, the sick and the shipwrecked. These date back to ancient times.\n\nIn the Old Testament, the King of Israel prevents the slaying of the captured, following the prophet Elisha's admonition to spare enemy prisoners. In answer to a question from the King, Elisha said, \"You shall not slay them. Would you slay those whom you have taken captive with your sword and with your bow? Set bread and water before them, that they may eat and drink and go to their master.\"\n\nIn ancient India there are records (the Laws of Manu, for example) describing the types of weapons that should not be used: \"When he fights with his foes in battle, let him not strike with weapons concealed (in wood), nor with (such as are) barbed, poisoned, or the points of which are blazing with fire.\" There is also the command not to strike a eunuch nor the enemy \"who folds his hands in supplication ... Nor one who sleeps, nor one who has lost his coat of mail, nor one who is naked, nor one who is disarmed, nor one who looks on without taking part in the fight.\"\n\nIslamic law states that \"non-combatants who did not take part in fighting such as women, children, monks and hermits, the aged, blind, and insane\" were not to be molested. The first Caliph, Abu Bakr, proclaimed, \"Do not mutilate. Do not kill little children or old men or women. Do not cut off the heads of palm trees or burn them. Do not cut down fruit trees. Do not slaughter livestock except for food.\" Islamic jurists have held that a prisoner should not be killed, as he \"cannot be held responsible for mere acts of belligerency\".\n\nIslamic law did not spare all non-combatants, however. In the case of those who refused to convert to Islam, or to pay an alternative tax, Muslims \"were allowed in principle to kill any one of them, combatants or noncombatants, provided they were not killed treacherously and with mutilation\".\n\nThe most important antecedent of IHL is the current Armistice Agreement and Regularization of War, signed and ratified in 1820 between the authorities of the then Government of Great Colombia and the Chief of the Expeditionary Forces of the Spanish Crown, in the Venezuelan city of santa Ana de Trujillo. This treaty was signed under the conflict of Independence, being the first of its kind in the West.\n\nIt was not until the second half of the 19th century, however, that a more systematic approach was initiated. In the United States, a German immigrant, Francis Lieber, drew up a code of conduct in 1863, which came to be known as the Lieber Code, for the Union Army during the American Civil War. The Lieber Code included the humane treatment of civilian populations in the areas of conflict, and also forbade the execution of POWs.\n\nAt the same time, the involvement during the Crimean War of a number of such individuals as Florence Nightingale and Henry Dunant, a Genevese businessman who had worked with wounded soldiers at the Battle of Solferino, led to more systematic efforts to prevent the suffering of war victims. Dunant wrote a book, which he titled \"A Memory of Solferino\", in which he described the horrors he had witnessed. His reports were so shocking that they led to the founding of the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) in 1863, and the convening of a conference in Geneva in 1864, which drew up the Geneva Convention for the Amelioration of the Condition of the Wounded in Armies in the Field. \nThe Law of Geneva is directly inspired by the principle of humanity. It relates to those who are not participating in the conflict, as well as to military personnel \"hors de combat\". It provides the legal basis for protection and humanitarian assistance carried out by impartial humanitarian organizations such as the ICRC. This focus can be found in the Geneva Conventions.\n\nThe Geneva Conventions are the result of a process that developed in a number of stages between 1864 and 1949. It focused on the protection of civilians and those who can no longer fight in an armed conflict. As a result of World War II, all four conventions were revised, based on previous revisions and on some of the 1907 Hague Conventions, and readopted by the international community in 1949. Later conferences have added provisions prohibiting certain methods of warfare and addressing issues of civil wars.\n\nThe first three Geneva Conventions were revised, expanded, and replaced, and the fourth one was added, in 1949.\n\n\nThere are three additional amendment protocols to the Geneva Convention:\n\n\nThe Geneva Conventions of 1949 may be seen, therefore, as the result of a process which began in 1864. Today they have \"achieved universal participation with 194 parties\". This means that they apply to almost any international armed conflict. The Additional Protocols, however, have yet to achieve near-universal acceptance, since the United States and several other significant military powers (like Iran, Israel, India and Pakistan) are currently not parties to them.\n\nWith the adoption of the 1977 Additional Protocols to the Geneva Conventions, the two strains of law began to converge, although provisions focusing on humanity could already be found in the Hague law (i.e. the protection of certain prisoners of war and civilians in occupied territories). The 1977 Additional Protocols, relating to the protection of victims in both international and internal conflict, not only incorporated aspects of both the Law of The Hague and the Law of Geneva, but also important human rights provisions.\n\n\nWell-known examples of such rules include the prohibition on attacking doctors or ambulances displaying a red cross. It is also prohibited to fire at a person or vehicle bearing a white flag, since that, being considered the flag of truce, indicates an intent to surrender or a desire to communicate. In either case, the persons protected by the Red Cross or the white flag are expected to maintain neutrality, and may not engage in warlike acts themselves; engaging in war activities under a white flag or a red cross is itself a violation of the laws of war.\n\nThese examples of the laws of war address:\n\nIt is a violation of the laws of war to engage in combat without meeting certain requirements, among them the wearing of a distinctive uniform or other easily identifiable badge, and the carrying of weapons openly. Impersonating soldiers of the other side by wearing the enemy's uniform is allowed, though fighting in that uniform is unlawful perfidy, as is the taking of hostages.\n\nInternational humanitarian law now includes several treaties that outlaw specific weapons. These conventions were created largely because these weapons cause deaths and injuries long after conflicts have ended. Unexploded land mines have caused up to 7,000 deaths a year; unexploded bombs, particularly from cluster bombs that scatter many small \"bomblets\", have also killed many. An estimated 98% of the victims are civilian; farmers tilling their fields and children who find these explosives have been common victims. For these reasons, the following conventions have been adopted:\n\n\nThe ICRC is the only institution explicitly named under international humanitarian law as a controlling authority. The legal mandate of the ICRC stems from the four Geneva Conventions of 1949, as well as from its own Statutes.\n\nDuring conflict, punishment for violating the laws of war may consist of a specific, deliberate and limited violation of the laws of war in reprisal.\n\nCombatants who break specific provisions of the laws of war lose the protections and status afforded to them as prisoners of war, but only after facing a \"competent tribunal\". At that point, they become unlawful combatants, but must still be \"treated with humanity and, in case of trial, shall not be deprived of the rights of fair and regular trial\", because they are still covered by .\n\nSpies and terrorists are only protected by the laws of war if the \"power\" which holds them is in a state of armed conflict or war, and until they are found to be an \"unlawful combatant\". Depending on the circumstances, they may be subject to civilian law or a military tribunal for their acts. In practice, they have often have been subjected to torture and execution. The laws of war neither approve nor condemn such acts, which fall outside their scope. Spies may only be punished following a trial; if captured after rejoining their own army, they must be treated as prisoners of war. Suspected terrorists who are captured during an armed conflict, without having participated in the hostilities, may be detained only in accordance with the GC IV, and are entitled to a regular trial. Countries that have signed the \"UN Convention Against Torture\" have committed themselves not to use torture on anyone for any reason.\n\nAfter a conflict has ended, persons who have committed any breach of the laws of war, and especially atrocities, may be held individually accountable for war crimes through process of law.\n\nThe Fourth Geneva Convention focuses on the civilian population. The two additional protocols adopted in 1977 extend and strengthen civilian protection in international (AP I) and non-international (AP II) armed conflict: for example, by introducing the prohibition of direct attacks against civilians. A \"civilian\" is defined as \"any person not belonging to the armed forces\", including non-nationals and refugees. However, it is accepted that operations may cause civilian casualties. Luis Moreno Ocampo, chief prosecutor of the international criminal court, wrote in 2006: \"International humanitarian law and the Rome statute permit belligerents to carry out proportionate attacks against military objectives, even when it is known that some civilian deaths or injuries will occur. A crime occurs if there is an intentional attack directed against civilians (principle of distinction) ... or an attack is launched on a military objective in the knowledge that the incidental civilian injuries would be clearly excessive in relation to the anticipated military advantage (principle of proportionality).\"\n\nThe provisions and principles of IHL which seek to protect civilians are:\n\nThe principle of distinction protects civilian population and civilian objects from the effects of military operations. It requires parties to an armed conflict to distinguish at all times, and under all circumstances, between combatants and military objectives on the one hand, and civilians and civilian objects on the other; and only to target the former. It also provides that civilians lose such protection should they take a direct part in hostilities. The principle of distinction has also been found by the ICRC to be reflected in state practice; it is therefore an established norm of customary international law in both international and non-international armed conflicts.\n\nNecessity and proportionality are established principles in humanitarian law. Under IHL, a belligerent may apply only the amount and kind of force necessary to defeat the enemy. Further, attacks on military objects must not cause loss of civilian life considered excessive in relation to the direct military advantage anticipated. Every feasible precaution must be taken by commanders to avoid civilian casualties. The principle of proportionality has also been found by the ICRC to form part of customary international law in international and non-international armed conflicts.\n\nThe principle of humane treatment requires that civilians be treated humanely at all times. Common Article 3 of the GCs prohibits violence to life and person (including cruel treatment and torture), the taking of hostages, humiliating and degrading treatment, and execution without regular trial against non-combatants, including persons \"hors de combat\" (wounded, sick and shipwrecked). Civilians are entitled to respect for their physical and mental integrity, their honour, family rights, religious convictions and practices, and their manners and customs. This principle of humane treatment has been affirmed by the ICRC as a norm of customary international law, applicable in both international and non-international armed conflicts.\n\nThe principle of non-discrimination is a core principle of IHL. Adverse distinction based on race, sex, nationality, religious belief or political opinion is prohibited in the treatment of prisoners of war, civilians, and persons \"hors de combat\". All protected persons shall be treated with the same consideration by parties to the conflict, without distinction based on race, religion, sex or political opinion. Each and every person affected by armed conflict is entitled to his fundamental rights and guarantees, without discrimination. The prohibition against adverse distinction is also considered by the ICRC to form part of customary international law in international and non-international armed conflict.\n\nWomen and children are granted preferential treatment, respect and protection. Women must be protected from rape and from any form of indecent assault. Children under the age of eighteen must not be permitted to take part in hostilities.\n\nIHL emphasises, in various provisions in the GCs and APs, the concept of formal equality and non-discrimination. Protections should be provided \"without any adverse distinction founded on sex\". For example, with regard to female prisoners of war, women are required to receive treatment \"as favourable as that granted to men\". In addition to claims of formal equality, IHL mandates special protections to women, providing female prisoners of war with separate dormitories from men, for example, and prohibiting sexual violence against women.\n\nThe reality of women's and men's lived experiences of conflict has highlighted some of the gender limitations of IHL. Feminist critics have challenged IHL's focus on male combatants and its relegation of women to the status of victims, and its granting them legitimacy almost exclusively as child-rearers. A study of the 42 provisions relating to women within the Geneva Conventions and the Additional Protocols found that almost half address women who are expectant or nursing mothers. Others have argued that the issue of sexual violence against men in conflict has not yet received the attention it deserves.\n\nSoft-law instruments have been relied on to supplement the protection of women in armed conflict:\n\n\nRead together with other legal mechanisms, in particular the UN Convention for the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women (CEDAW), these can enhance interpretation and implementation of IHL.\n\nIn addition, international criminal tribunals (like the International Criminal Tribunals for the former Yugoslavia and Rwanda) and mixed tribunals (like the Special Court for Sierra Leone) have contributed to expanding the scope of definitions of sexual violence and rape in conflict. They have effectively prosecuted sexual and gender-based crimes committed during armed conflict. There is now well-established jurisprudence on gender-based crimes. Nonetheless, there remains an urgent need to further develop constructions of gender within international humanitarian law.\n\nIHL has generally not been subject to the same debates and criticisms of \"cultural relativism\" as have international human rights. Although the modern codification of IHL in the Geneva Conventions and the Additional Protocols is relatively new, and European in name, the core concepts are not new, and laws relating to warfare can be found in all cultures.\n\nICRC studies on the Middle East, Somalia, Latin America, and the Pacific, for example have found that there are traditional and long-standing practices in various cultures that preceded, but are generally consistent with, modern IHL. It is important to respect local and cultural practices that are in line with IHL. Relying on these links and on local practices can help to promote awareness of and adherence to IHL principles among local groups and communities.\n\nDurham cautions that, although traditional practices and IHL legal norms are largely compatible, it is important not to assume perfect alignment. There are areas in which legal norms and cultural practices clash. Violence against women, for example, is frequently legitimised by arguments from culture, and yet is prohibited in IHL and other international law. In such cases, it is important to ensure that IHL is not negatively affected.\n\n\n\n\n"}

Early on, Nancy excelled in athletics and scholarship. Finding that her high school did not offer the courses she needed to take in order to become a dentist like her father, she moved to Green Bay, Wisconsin to live with two aunts to attend St. Joseph’s Academy for junior and senior high school. During this period, she found that she had a vocation to follow in the footsteps of her teachers and become a Sister of St. Joseph of Carondolet.\n\nDuring her formation with the Sisters of St. Joseph, she received the name Sister Jane Edward, a combination of her younger sister’s and brother’s names. An avid scholar, she received her bachelor’s degree in European and American History at Fontbonne University in Saint Louis and her Master’s of Ancient History at Loyola University in Chicago. Following her first assignment as a teacher in St. Rita’s School in St. Louis, she was next assigned to St. Matthew’s School in the inner city. Here, she developed a passion for civil rights and social justice. She assisted with curriculum development for students at the Saint Louis hospital for black residents, Homer G. Phillips, and assisted in ministering to ex-convicts at nearby Dismas House, established by Father Charles \"Dismas\" Clark and Morris Shenker.\n\nIn 1964, Schilling's was assigned to teach at Holy Angels Catholic School in Indianapolis, Indiana, a school that had transitioned to a majority black student population. She embraced this role with high energy, establishing a drum and bugle corps to increase school pride and visibility within the community. After she was named principal, she engaged in implementing educational reforms of the time, such as open classrooms, right/left brain teaching, and psychomotor approaches for teaching reading.\n\nShortly after her arrival at Holy Angels, Schilling's life was radically changed when a new Associate Pastor at Holy Angels Parish, Boniface Hardin, arrived on the scene. The two shared a commitment to education and social change, a bond that created a partnership that would last for the remainder of their lives.\n\nWorking together, Schilling and Hardin became activists in church and community reform. They fought police brutality and targeting of black citizens, de facto school segregation, lack of representation of black clergy and traditions within the Catholic Church, poverty, and unfair housing practices. A key focus became the fight to prevent a major highway, Interstate 65, from bifurcating the predominately black northwest neighborhood surrounding Holy Angels Parish.\n\nWhen police pressure on the Archbishop of Indianapolis, Paul Schulte, triggered a decision to remove Hardin from Holy Angels Parish in 1969, parishioners rose up and staged a nationally publicized demonstration in Saints Peter and Paul Cathedral where the Archbishop was presiding at Easter services. Although the Archbishop rescinded his order, Hardin left Holy Angels to found Martin Center, an educational and social justice center, at the close of 1969. Within a year, Schilling received permission from her religious community to work full-time at Martin Center as Education Coordinator.\n\nMartin Center was named for Martin Luther King Jr. and St. Martin de Porres, patron saint, within the Catholic Church, of poor and mixed race people. Its mission evolved from an initial goal of educating clergy and white people about discriminatory attitudes and practices to include celebrating black cultural heritage and engaging black community members in activism and self-identity. While Hardin traveled as a speaker and consultant to raise funds for the Center, Schilling became the day-to-day administrator.\n\nDrawing on her background as a history scholar, Schilling did the research and production of designs and materials for workshops, speeches, and activities of Martin Center. Soon, the mission of the Center expanded to include the Martin Sickle Cell Center, which received major national funding to educate the community and screen for this disease, and the Afro-American Institute, which focused on African and African-American culture and achievements. Schilling served as Director of Community Education at the Sickle Cell Center from 1970 to 1977 and received its award for 25 Years of Dedication to Sickle Cell and Visionary Leadership.\n\nThrough the Afro-American Institute, Martin Center housed a library of materials and artifacts, created and acquired by Schilling and Hardin. They also produced a regular scholarly periodical, the \"Afro-American Journal\" (1973–78); two full-length TV documentaries—\"The Kingdom Builders\" and \"For Love of Freedom\"—for the local NBC affiliate in Indianapolis; a weekly radio program, \"The Afro-American in Indiana\" (1971-1991) for WIAN, the local public radio station; and a weekly television show, \"Afro-American\" (1974–79), for public television. Schilling co-hosted these programs and was the major researcher behind the productions.\n\nAs Martin Center expanded its educational offerings to the community, it collaborated with Indiana University Purdue University-Indianapolis to create courses for college credit. This venture led Schilling and Hardin to found Indiana’s only minority serving institution, Martin University.\n\nFrom the start, Schilling's role in the creation and growth of Martin University was chief academic officer, strategist, and educational developer. As Founding Vice President for Academic Affairs, she was a key voice in articulating the philosophy behind the institution, inspired by the concept of “andragogy” advanced by Malcolm Knowles. The approach emphasized drawing on the strengths and past experience of adult learners, the major population of the university. Through her hiring decisions and curriculum and faculty development efforts, Schilling collaborated with Hardin to become the guiding force behind the school’s educational direction.\n\nSchilling presided over Academic Affairs at Martin University from its early beginnings with a handful of students in 1977 as Martin Center College, through 1979 as Martin College became a separate entity from Martin Center, and finally through 1990, when the addition of graduate programs enabled the change to Martin University, a school with nearly 1000 students. She was the key architect of successful accreditation and expansion proposals to the North Central Association of Colleges and Schools (changed in 2014 to the Higher Learning Commission). She became known at Martin for her sense of humor and the compassion she showed students through acts such as serving soup to those who came directly from work to classes.\n\nWhile Vice President of Martin University, Schilling participated in numerous initiatives within the Indianapolis community, including serving on the Crispus Attucks Museum Committee and acting as consultant and workshop facilitator for the Indianapolis Public Schools. She continued to guide the Martin Center, serving as its Executive Director from 1984 to 1988.\n\nSchilling received a number of Martin University Awards. These included the Mary McLeod Bethune Award and the Martin University Board of Trustees Wind Under Our Wings Award. In 2005, she received the Honorary Doctor of Laws degree from Martin University. After 30 years of service, Schilling retired from Martin University in 2007. She died on September 13, 2017 at Nazareth Living House, Sisters of St. Joseph of Carondolet, St. Louis.\n\nWIAN-FM Outstanding Service Award\n\nLeadership in Education Award, Indianapolis Education Association\n\nDr. Martin Luther King, Jr. Drum Major Award, Indiana Christian Leadership Conference\n\nDr. Martin Luther King, Jr. 1995 Individual Award, Madame Walker Institute, Indianapolis\n\nDiamond Award, United to Serve America\n\nService to the Black Community, King-Walker-Wilkins-Young Awards Committee\n\nPaul Harris Fellow, Rotary International\n\nHeroism Award, American Red Cross\n\nSagamore of the Wabash, Governor of Indiana\n\nRole Modelship Award, Wheeler Boys and Girls Club\n\nMother of the Year, Nur-Allah Islamic Center, Indianapolis\n\n100 Heros, United Way of Central Indiana\n"}
{"id": "255627", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=255627", "title": "List of capitals in the United States", "text": "List of capitals in the United States\n\nWashington, D.C. has been the federal capital city of the United States since 1790. Each U.S. state has its own capital city, as do many of its insular areas. Historically, most states have not changed their capital city since becoming a state, but the capital cities of their respective preceding colonies, territories, kingdoms, and republics typically changed multiple times. There have also been other governments within the current borders of the United States with their own capitals, such as the Republic of Texas, Native American nations, and other unrecognized governments.\n\n\nThe dates listed in the following table indicate the year in which the city started to continuously serve as the state's sole capital. Most states have changed their capital city at least once. In the case of the thirteen original states, \"statehood\" in the table refers to date of ratification of the United States Constitution.\n\nAn insular area is a United States territory that is neither a part of one of the fifty states nor a part of the District of Columbia, the nation's federal district. Those insular areas with territorial capitals are listed below.\n\nPrior to becoming a territory of the United States in 1898, Hawaii was an independent country. Five sites served as its capital:\n\n\nBefore joining the United States under the Texas Annexation in 1845, Texas was an independent nation known as the Republic of Texas. Seven cities served as its capital:\n\nSome Native American tribes, in particular the Five Civilized Tribes, organized their states with constitutions and capitals in Western style. Others, like the Iroquois, had long-standing, pre-Columbian traditions of a 'capitol' longhouse where wampum and council fires were maintained with special status. Since they did business with the U.S. Federal Government, these capitals can be seen as officially recognized in some sense.\n\nNew Echota, now near Calhoun, Georgia was founded in 1825, realizing the dream and plans of Cherokee Chief Major Ridge. Major Ridge chose the site because of its centrality in the historic Cherokee Nation which spanned parts of Georgia, North Carolina, Tennessee and Alabama, and because it was near the confluence of the Conasauga and Coosawattee rivers. The town's layout was partly inspired by Ridge's many visits to Washington D.C. and to Baltimore, but also invoked traditional themes of the Southeastern ceremonial complex. Complete with the Council House, Supreme Court, Cherokee syllabary printing press, and the houses of several of the Nation's constitutional officers, New Echota served as the capital until 1832 when the state of Georgia outlawed Native American assembly in an attempt to undermine the Nation. Thousands of Cherokee would gather in New Echota for the annual National Councils, camping along the nearby rivers and holding long stomp dances in the park-like woods that were typical of many Southeastern Native American settlements. \nThe Cherokee National council grounds were moved to Red Clay, Tennessee on the Georgia state line in order to evade the Georgia state militia. The log cabins, limestone springs and park-like woods of Red Clay served as the capital until the Cherokee Nation was removed to Indian Territory (Oklahoma) on the Trail of Tears. \nTahlequah, in present-day Oklahoma, served as the capital of the original Cherokee Nation after Removal. After the Civil War, a turbulent period for the Nation which was involved in its own civil war resulting from pervasive anger and disagreements over removal from Georgia, the Cherokee Nation built a new National Capitol in Tahlequah out of brick. The building served as the capitol until 1907, when the Dawes Act finally dissolved the Cherokee Nation and Tahlequah became the county seat of Cherokee County, Oklahoma. The Cherokee National government was re-established in 1938 and Tahlequah remains the capital of the modern Cherokee Nation; it is also the capital of the United Keetoowah Band of Cherokee Indians.\nApproximately four to eight hundred Cherokees escaped removal because they lived on a separated tract, purchased later with the help of Confederate Colonel William Holland Thomas, along the Oconaluftee river deep in the Smoky Mountains of North Carolina. Some Cherokees fleeing the Federal Army sent for the \"round up,\" fled to the remote settlements separated from the rest of the Cherokee Territory in Georgia and North Carolina in order to remain in their homeland. In the 20th century, their descendants organized as the Eastern Band of Cherokee Indians; its capital is at Cherokee, North Carolina, in the tribally-controlled Qualla Boundary.\n\nAfter Removal from their Alabama-Georgia homeland, the Creek national government met near Hot Springs which was then part of their new territory as prescribed in the Treaty of Cusseta. However, the Union forced the Creeks to cede over three million acres (half of their land) of what is now Arkansas, after some Creeks fought with the Confederacy in the American Civil War.\nServed as the National capital after the American Civil War. It was probably named after Ocmulgee, on the Ocmulgee river in Macon, a principle Coosa and later Creek town built with mounds and functioning as part of the Southeastern ceremonial complex. However, there were other traditional Creek \"mother-towns\" before removal. The Ocmulgee mounds were ceded illegally in 1821 with the Treaty of Indian Springs.\n\nThe Iroquois Confederacy or Haudenosaunee, which means \"People of the Longhouse,\" was an alliance between the Five and later Six-Nations of Iroquoian language and culture of upstate New York. These include the Seneca, Cayuga, Onondaga, Oneida, Mohawk, and, after 1722, the Tuscarora Nations. Since the Confederacy's formation around 1450, the Onondaga Nation has held privilege of hosting the Iroquois Grand Council and the status of Keepers of the Fire and the Wampum —which they still do at the official Longhouse on the Onondaga Reservation. Now spread over reservations in New York and Ontario, the Six Nations of the Haudenosaunee preserve this arrangement to this day in what they claim to be the \"world's oldest representative democracy.\"\n\n\nThe Seneca Nation republic was founded in 1848 and has two capitals that rotate responsibilities every two years. Jimerson Town was founded in the 1960s following the formation of the Allegheny Reservoir. The Senecas also have an administrative longhouse in Steamburg but do not consider that location to be a capital.\n\nWindow Rock (Navajo: \"Tségháhoodzání\"), Arizona, is a small city that serves as the seat of government and capital of the Navajo Nation (1936–present), the largest territory of a sovereign Native American nation in North America. It lies within the boundaries of the St. Michaels Chapter, adjacent to the Arizona and New Mexico state line. Window Rock hosts the Navajo Nation governmental campus which contains the Navajo Nation Council, Navajo Nation Supreme Court, the offices of the Navajo Nation President and Vice President, and many Navajo government buildings.\n\nThere have been a handful of nations within the current borders of the United States which were never officially recognized as legally independent sovereign entities; however, these nations did have \"de facto\" control over their respective regions during their existence.\n\nBefore joining the United States as the fourteenth state, Vermont was an independent republic known as the Vermont Republic. Two cities served as the capital of the Republic:\n\nThe current capital of the State of Vermont is Montpelier.\n\nThe State of Franklin was an autonomous, secessionist United States territory created, not long after the end of the American Revolution, from territory that later was ceded by North Carolina to the federal government. Franklin's territory later became part of the state of Tennessee. Franklin was never officially admitted into the Union of the United States and existed for only four years.\n\nThe State of Muskogee was a short-lived Native American state in Florida, created by the Englishman William Augustus Bowles, who was its \"Director General\", author of its Constitution and designer of its flag. It consisted of several tribes of Creeks and Seminoles. It existed from 1799 to 1803. It had one capital:\n\nThe Republic of West Florida was a short-lived republic involving the area known today as Louisiana's Florida Parishes — at the time the westernmost portion of Spanish West Florida. The area was soon seized by the United States under President James Madison and incorporated into the Territory of Orleans. None of the Republic of West Florida was within the boundaries of modern Florida.\n\nThe Republic of Indian Stream was an unrecognized independent nation within the present state of New Hampshire.\n\nBefore being annexed by the United States in 1848 (following the Mexican–American War), a small portion of north-central California declared itself the California Republic, in an act of independence from Mexico, in 1846 (see Bear Flag Revolt). The republic only existed a month before it disbanded itself, to join the advancing American army and therefore became part of the United States.\n\nThe very short-lived California Republic was never recognized by the United States, Mexico or any other nation. There was one \"de facto\" capital of the California Republic:\n\nThe Confederate States of America (C.S.A.) had two capitals during its existence. The first capital was established February 4, 1861, in Montgomery, Alabama, and remained there until it was moved to Richmond, Virginia, on May 29, 1861, after Virginia seceded on May 23.\n\nThe individual state capitals remained the same in the Confederacy as they had been in the Union (U.S.A.), although as the advancing Union Army used those cities for military districts, some of the Confederate governments were relocated or moved out of state, traveling along with secessionist armies.\n\n\nMost of the original Thirteen Colonies had their capitals occupied or attacked by the British during the American Revolutionary War. State governments operated where and as they could. The City of New York was occupied by British troops from 1776 to 1783. A similar situation occurred during the War of 1812, during the American Civil War in many Confederate states, and during the Pueblo Revolt of 1680–1692 in New Mexico.\n\nTwenty-two state capitals have been a capital longer than their state has been a state, since they served as the capital of a predecessor territory, colony, or republic. Boston, Massachusetts, has been a capital city since 1630; it is the oldest continuously-running capital in the United States. Santa Fe, New Mexico, is the oldest capital city, having become capital in 1610 and interrupted only by the aforementioned Pueblo Revolt. An even older Spanish city, St. Augustine, Florida, served as a colonial capital from 1565 until about 1820, more than 250 years.\n\nThe table below includes the following information:\n\n\n Even though the urbanized area of Carson City is about from the California border, the larger Consolidated Municipality of Carson City does form part of the Nevada state border. Similarly, the City and Borough of Juneau extends eastward to British Columbia, although the urbanized area of Juneau is about from the Canada–US border.\n\n"}

After Mao Zedong and the Chinese Communist Party took over power, his refugee parents left for Australia.\n\nRaised by his secretary mother in Sydney, he was educated at the local Christian Brothers school. He then studied at the University of Sydney where he obtained a BSc degree in physics in 1975 and a BE degree in engineering in 1977, residing at St John's College. He also holds an MSc degree in Acoustics from the University of New South Wales, an MBA degree from Harvard Business School, and an Honorary Doctorate of Business from the University of New South Wales.\n\nOn graduation, he joined the Australian Army for three years, rising to the rank of captain. Following that, he worked as an electrical design engineer for Civil and Civic Pty Ltd. in Australia.\n\nMoving to New York to train in financial services, he worked for Salomon Brothers as a fixed income trader and at Credit Suisse First Boston. Relocating to London with them, he then joined Goldman Sachs, where his ultimate position was Co-head of the UK Shares Product. He left the firm in 1995.\n\nIn 1999 he launched his own asset management firm, CQS, and has been cited in the press as one of the highest paid people in the City of London. Hintze was ranked No. 5 on Financial News' FN100 Most Influential list in the hedge fund category. CQS Asset Management, which has been described as \"one of the world's leading credit market players\" has assets under management reported at $11 billion. The CQS Directional Opportunities Fund, which is managed by Hintze, was ranked #3 on Bloomberg's list of the 100 top-performing large hedge funds for 2012.\n\nIn 2013, Hintze's CQS received awards for the \"Best Hedge Fund Manager Overall,\" \"Best Hedge Fund Manager in Credit,\" and \"Best Multi-Hedge Fund Manager\" at the Financial News Awards for Excellence in Institutional Hedge Fund Management. CQS was reported to be on the opposite side of the infamous JPMorgan trade by Bruno Iksil, nicknamed the London Whale, in which JPMorgan lost an estimated $2 billion. The total gains by CQS are unknown.\n\nHintze is credited by veteran economic commentator and journalist Alex Brummer with warning about the state of UK banking, the outlook for the UK housing market, and the scale of toxic-debt on the balance sheets of UK banks. \n\nDue to his expertise in global financial markets, Hintze has been tapped to sit on a number of boards and government panels. He was appointed by the Australian Treasury to sit on a four-person International Advisory Panel to support the Financial Systems Inquiry (FSI), which is focused on issues impacting Australia's economy such as technological change, Australia's global competitiveness and offshore regulatory frameworks.\n\nHintze was appointed by Pope Francis to the board of the Vatican Bank (officially known as the Institute for the Works of Religion). According to ValueWalk, “The addition of Hintze is viewed as a significant positive for the Vatican” due to the fact that he is a “no nonsense manager with deep insight into a broad range of international finance matters.”\n\nIn the UK, Hintze was also appointed to serve on the Fair and Effective Markets Review, a joint review by the Treasury, the Bank of England and the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) focused on raising standards of conduct in the financial system. He also sits on the Finance & Audit Committee of the Duchy of Cornwall.\n\nIn 2007, Hintze established MH Premium Farms (MHPF), a group of agriculture companies based mainly in Australia. MHPF now owns more than 20 properties in eastern Australia, covering a total area of more than 70,000 hectares. The properties offer a broad portfolio including: fat lambs, wool and cattle; broad acre cropping of cereals and oilseeds; irrigated cotton and sugar.\n\nMHPF is managed by a team of agricultural specialists, led by CEO Richard Taylor, who graduated from Sydney University with a 1st class honours degree in Veterinary Science in 1987 and has since managed a number of agricultural companies in Australia.\n\nThe group maintains sustainable production practices and places an emphasis on environmental responsibility. \n\nAs part of its corporate social responsibility (CSR) efforts, MHPF has also launched an undergraduate scholarship aimed at addressing the shortage of agronomists, and agriculture graduates more generally who may go on to service Australian agriculture. Offered through the University of New England, the scholarship supports a full-time, on-campus student beginning their second year of either an Agriculture or Rural Science degree with an interest in pursuing a career as an agronomist in Australia following graduation and provides recipients with an 8-week work experience placement.\n\nWith his wife Dorothy, Hintze set up the Hintze Family Charitable Foundation, which has given significant and wide-ranging philanthropic support to over 200 causes, focusing mainly on health, education, armed services, culture, and the arts.\n\nIn the area of culture and the arts, notable donations include enabling the restoration of Michelangelo's frescoes in the Pauline Chapel at the Vatican and in 2014 donating £5 million to the Natural History Museum, London. The donation to the Natural History Museum is the biggest single donation received by the museum in 133 years (in other words, since 1881 when the Museum opened to the public for the first time). The gift will be used in part to fund programmes to study problems that threaten Earth's biodiversity such as the maintenance of delicate ecosystems and the impacts of environmental pollution, as well as the battle against diseases such as malaria. The museum's Central Hall has since been renamed 'Hintze Hall'.\n\nProjects in culture and the arts have also enabled the refurbishment of the V&A's Sculpture Galleries, named the Dorothy and Michael Hintze Galleries, and have included sponsorship of an iconic exhibition of Raphael's Tapestries from the Sistine Chapel at the V&A, and a £2 million donation to the National Gallery. The donation to the National Gallery has been used in part to fund refurbishment, including the installation of new technology to reduce the gallery's running costs and carbon footprint. Support has also been provided to the British Museum and the National Portrait Gallery. The Hintze Family Charitable Foundation is also listed as a Life Benefactor Donor to the National Theatre. Through CQS and the Hintze Family Charitable Foundation he provided funding to create a 'theatre in the round' at the Old Vic in London, amongst other significant support. He also came to the aid of Wandsworth Museum, which was facing imminent closure by offering a £2 million rescue package.\n\nIn the area of health, he co-chaired Clapham's Trinity Hospice campaign for a new in-patient centre which has now been completed. Hintze gave a $1 million gift to the University of Sydney's Charles Perkins Centre, which focuses on turning medical research into viable treatments. He has also provided support to the Evelina Children's Hospital.\n\nHis support for the armed services has included donations to The Royal Navy & Royal Marines Charity. Among other initiatives, this has included providing funding to support serving personnel and their families. He has also provided support to the Black Stork Charity to help construct one of the most advanced centres for rehabilitation of injured military personnel in the world.\n\nIn education, among major donations, he has established the chair of International Security at the University of Sydney and supported the University of Oxford Centre for Astrophysical Surveys, where the Annual Hintze Lecture has been established.\n\nFunding was provided for the construction of a residential wing at St. John’s College at the University of Sydney, which was named the Hintze Building. Hintze has also donated $1 million to the University of New South Wales (UNSW) for a new lecture theatre. The donation was made in honour of his father, Michael Hintze senior, who is also a UNSW alumnus. Gifts have also been made to Harvard University ($10m) and Princeton University, where a Professorship for the Arts has been established in his wife's maiden name (Dorothy Krauklis).\n\n\"The Guardian\" reported that Hintze is a donor to the Global Warming Policy Foundation.\n\nHintze currently serves as a trustee of the National Portrait Gallery, the Institute of Economic Affairs, the University of Sydney Trust, as a Member of the Harvard Business School Board of Dean’s Advisors’, and as Senior Vice Patron of the Royal Navy & Royal Marines Charity. He was formerly chairman of the Prince's Foundation for Building Community.\n\nHintze was formerly a trustee of the National Gallery, where he assisted in securing Titian’s \"Diana and Actaeon\" for the nation. He was initially appointed to the National Gallery's Board of Trustees by then Labour Party Prime Minister Gordon Brown in 2008. He was later reappointed by Conservative Party Prime Minister David Cameron.\n\nIn recognition of their charitable contributions in support of the arts, Michael Hintze and his wife Dorothy received the Prince of Wales Medal for Arts Philanthropy in 2009.\n\nHintze was invited to the Chancellor's Court of Benefactors for his support of the University of Oxford.\n\nHe was named to the 2017 Debrett’s 500 List, in recognition of his considerable philanthropic contributions in the UK. He was also named to the Evening Standard’s “Progress 1000” list of “London’s most influential people,” citing his philanthropic contributions and business success.\n\nIn 2006, at the time of the Cash for Peerages allegations concerning the Labour Party, Hintze voluntarily revealed he was one of the previously anonymous patrons who had made loans to the Conservative Party. In 2011 his known loans and donations to the party totalled around £4 million. In the five months to September 2011 he donated £31,000, enough to grant him membership of the Conservative Treasurers' Group, the second highest rung on the party's donor's ladder, which allows its members access to senior Conservative figures through a series of lunches, receptions and campaign launches.\n\nWhen the Conservative Party were in opposition, Hintze disclosed that he had donated to George Osborne, David Willetts, Liam Fox, Theresa May, David Davis, Adam Holloway, and Boris Johnson. In addition, CQS made non-cash donations to William Hague, Liam Fox, and George Osborne. In May 2008, David Cameron declared a donation from Hintze to the Conservative Party that was used to pay for drinks receptions for Tory MPs and their partners. In March 2008, Hintze paid for a private jet to ferry Cameron and Osborne from Newcastle to Biggin Hill after the Conservative Party conference.\n\nIn October 2011, it was revealed that Adam Werritty, a close friend and business associate of then Secretary of State for Defence Liam Fox, was provided with a free desk by Hintze at CQS's London base as part of his £29,000 donation to Fox's charity \"The Atlantic Bridge\". Hintze also supplied a private jet for Fox and Werritty to fly from the United States to London in May 2011. These disclosures led to the resignation of Liam Fox (who was then Secretary of State for Defence) and the dismissal of Hintze's then-charity adviser, Oliver Hylton.\n\nHe was made a Knight Commander of the Papal Order of St. Gregory (KCSG) by Pope Benedict XVI in 2005 and was later was elevated to a Knight Grand Cross of the same Order (GCSG).\n\nIn January 2013, Hintze was appointed Member of the Order of Australia (AM) for his \"significant service to the community through philanthropic contributions to organisations supporting the arts, health and education.\"\n\nHe was knighted in the United Kingdom's 2013 Birthday Honours for services to the arts. He received his accolade on 23 October 2013 by The Prince of Wales at Buckingham Palace.\n\nMarried to American citizen Dorothy, whom he met at Harvard, the couple have four children, partially educated at British private schools. Hintze is a Roman Catholic.\n"}
{"id": "3155077", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=3155077", "title": "Neue Rheinische Zeitung", "text": "Neue Rheinische Zeitung\n\nThe Neue Rheinische Zeitung: Organ der Demokratie (\"New Rhenish Newspaper: Organ of Democracy\") was a German daily newspaper, published by Karl Marx in Cologne between 1 June 1848 and 19 May 1849. It is recognised by historians as one of the most important dailies of the Revolutions of 1848 in Germany. The paper was regarded by its editors and readers as the successor of an earlier Cologne newspaper, the \"Rheinische Zeitung\" (\"Rhenish Newspaper\"), also edited for a time by Karl Marx, which had been suppressed by state censorship over five years earlier.\n\nThe \"Neue Rheinische Zeitung: Organ der Demokratie\" (\"New Rhenish Newspaper: Organ of Democracy\") was founded 1 June 1848 in Cologne (Köln), part of Rhineland. The paper was established by Karl Marx, Frederick Engels, as well as leading members of the Communist League living in Cologne immediately upon the return of Marx and Engels to Germany following the outbreak of the 1848 Revolution. The paper's editorial staff included Joseph Weydemeyer, with Marx serving as editor-in-chief.\n\nThe paper was named after an earlier newspaper edited by Karl Marx in Cologne from 1842 to 1843, the \"Rheinische Zeitung.\" The paper had the subtitle \"Organ of Democracy,\" referring not to the establishment of parliamentary democracy, but to the revolutionary \"Democratic front\" which included the progressive petty bourgeoisie, the working class, and the peasantry.\n\nThe paper was financed through the sale of shares of stock, contributions and loans, and paid advertising. The paper was produced as a 4-page broadsheet, with the use of occasional special supplements.\n\nCirculation of the paper ranged from 3,000 to 6,000 copies per issue, a number far in excess of the membership of the Communist League itself, which specialists estimate had between 200 and 300 participants. This effectively rendered the publication into what historian Tatyana Vasilyeva has called \"the leading centre of the Communist League, directing the political activity of its members throughout Germany during the revolutionary period.\"\n\nA total of 301 editions of the \"Neue Rheinische Zeitung\" (NRZ) were produced during the course of its existence. To these Marx himself contributed a total of not fewer than 80 articles over the course of its existence. Since editorial contributions to the NRZ were unsigned and handwritten manuscripts have not survived, a precise count is impossible, however.\n\nThe \"Neue Rheinische Zeitung\" (NRZ) was outspoken in its criticism of Prussia and Austria for Monarchist counter-revolution, and actively agitated for their defeat. The paper was also critical of the willingness of the liberal bourgeoisie to compromise with Monarchist forces — policies which Marx and his comrades believed would have negative impacts upon the German revolution.\n\nMore than three decades after the publication's termination, Marx's close associate Frederick Engels recalled that the NRZ had a political program with two main points: \"a single, indivisible, democratic German republic, and War with Russia, including the restoration of Poland.\" With respect to foreign affairs, Engels recalled that the NRZ sought \"to support every revolutionary people and to call for a general war of revolutionary Europe against the mighty bulwark of European reaction — Russia.\"\n\nThis policy was intended to undermine both the authority of Prussia and Tsarist Russia, both considered reactionary and militaristic powers, with war against Russia seen as a necessary prerequisite for establishment of a unified and democratic Germany. Marx and Engels believed that \"if Germany could be successfully brought to make war against Russia, it would be the end for the Habsburgs and Hohenzollerns and the revolution would triumph along the whole line.\"\n\nThe tone of the newspaper was described by Engels as \"by no means solemn, serious, or enthusiastic,\" instead treating political opponents with \"mockery and derision\" in a manner entertaining to readers. The paper sought to foster the idea that the German events of the spring of 1848 were the starting point of a long revolutionary process akin to the French Revolution of 1789-1794. The paper attempted to undermine the notion that the formal resolutions of various \"National Assemblies\" were capable of changing state policy in any fundamental way.\n\nThroughout its existence the NRZ was persecuted by the Prussian government, which brought lawsuits against it charging the NRZ with having \"slandered\" government officials. As the revolutionary upsurge of 1848 ebbed, the government's hindrance of the publication became steadily more effective, culminating in Karl Marx's expulsion from Germany — a move which effectively killed the paper.\n\nOn 2 March 1849, Prussian soldiers came to Marx's home to arrest one of the writers. Marx refused to turn over the writer, and the soldiers eventually left. \n\nOn 16 May 1849 Marx received an official note from the royal government declaring:\n\"The tendency of the \"Neue Rheinische Zeitung\" to provoke in its readers contempt for the present government, and incite them to violent revolution and the setting up of a social republic has become stronger in its latest pieces... The right of hospitality which he has so disgracefully abused is therefore to be withdrawn from its editor-in-chief, Dr. Karl Marx, and since he has not obtained permission to prolong his stay in these states, he is ordered to leave them within 24 hours. If he should not comply voluntarily with this demand, he is to be forcibly conveyed across the frontier.\"\n\nThis expulsion order, combined with the growing threat of arrest or exile of its writers forced the NRZ to publish its last issue on 19 May 1849, known as the \"red issue\" as it was printed entirely in red ink. Marx closed with a sharp rebuttal against the suppression of the NRZ:\n\"Why these absurd phrases, these official lies? The trend and tone of the latest pieces of the \"Neue Rheinische Zeitung\" do not differ a whit from its first 'sample piece.' * * *\n\"And the 'social republic'? Have we proclaimed it only in the 'latest pieces' of the \"Neue Rheinische Zeitung?\" Did we not speak plainly and clearly enough for these dullards who failed to see the 'red' thread running through all our comments and reports on the European movement? * * *\n\"We have no compassion and we ask no compassion from you. When our turn comes, we shall not make excuses for the terror. But the royal terrorists, the terrorists by the grace of God and the law, are in practice brutal, disdainful, and mean, in theory cowardly, secretive, and deceitful, and in both respects disreputable.\"\n\nIn January 1850 Marx launched a new publication, a monthly magazine called \"\" (\"New Rhenish Newspaper: Politico-Economic Review\"). Edited in London and printed in Hamburg, the periodical managed only six issues before folding.\n\nThe best-known content of the NRZ were a series of five articles on economics published by Marx in April 1849 — a series unfinished due to the suppression of the paper. First gathered under a single set of covers under the title \"Wage-labor and Capital\" in 1880, this material was subsequently revised by Engels in 1891 and frequently reprinted thereafter as an accessible popularization of Marxist economics.\n\nThe great bulk of the journalism of Karl Marx and Frederick Engels in the NRZ became systematically accessible to an English readership only in 1977, with the publication of volumes 7, 8, and 9 of the \"Marx-Engels Collected Works.\" It was then that a total of 357 of the 422 articles contained therein were published in English for the first time.\n\nIn 2005 an online newspaper calling itself \"Neue Rheinische Zeitung\" was established.\n\n\n\n\n"}

The uprising in the Palatine Electorate and its surrounding area took place in April to June 1525.\n\nThe start of the German Peasants' War in West Rhenish Palatinate was marked by the gathering of a band of peasants, a so-called \"Haufe\", at Nußdorf near Landau on 23 April 1525. The Palatine peasant mobs plundered several surrounding monasteries (including the Knights Hospitaller commandry of Heimbach near Zeiskam as well as Hördt, where the provost was killed) and castles, before they took Neustadt on 6 May without a fight. The peasants' programme was based on the Twelve Articles, which were drawn up at Memmingen and of which 25,000 copies were printed. A second \"Haufe\" gathered near Bockenheim. As a result, the Palatine prince-elector, Louis V felt forced into negotiations with the Geilweiler and Bockenheim groups; these began on 10 May in Forst. The complaints were to be handled by a \"Landtag\". The Elector finally resorted to military force against the peasants on 23 May with the support of troops from the Archbishop of Trier, after other princes had defeated the uprisings in Württemberg and in the Alsace.

In June 1931, a meeting of state premiers agreed on the Premiers' Plan, which involved sweeping austerity measures combined with increases in revenue. When the Premiers' Plan came up for a vote in South Australia, 23 of Labor's 30 House of Assembly members and two of Labor's four Legislative Council members voted for it. In August 1931, the South Australian state conference of the Labor Party expelled all of the MPs who supported the Premiers' Plan, including Premier Lionel Hill and his entire Cabinet.\n\nExpelled MPs (23) in the House of Assembly: \n\nExpelled MPs (2) in the Legislative Council: \n\nUpon the failure of a November appeal to the federal executive of the Labor Party, the expelled MPs definitively constituted themselves as a separate parliamentary party.\n\nHaving soundly lost its majority, the PLP ministry stayed in office until the 1933 election with the support of the conservative opposition--the Liberal Federation to 1932 and the Liberal and Country League afterward. Hill, facing increasing political challenges, had himself appointed Agent-General in London and abruptly quit politics in February 1932. Robert Richards briefly succeeded him as Premier, and led the party into the 1933 election.\n\nThe party, along with the official Labor Party and the rival splinter Lang Labor Party, performed poorly at the 1933 election. Of the 23 MPs the party had going into the election, only five – Blackwell, McInnes, Pedler, and Richards in the House of Assembly, and Whitford in the Legislative Council, were reelected. The three Labor factions won only 13 seats between them, against 29 for the LCL.\n\nTwo of the three Lang Labor Party MHAs elected at the 1933 state election, Bob Dale and Tom Howard, left the party in 1933 post-election after falling out with leader Doug Bardolph and formed their own party, the South Australian Lang Labor Party (SALLP).\n\nThe four Labor parties merged back into the official Labor Party in June 1934 under the leadership of Andrew Lacey of the official Labor faction, following a successful unity conference. Whitford, the party's sole upper house member, had left the party to sit as an independent by the time of the conference, and was not re-admitted.\n\n"}

They are a 2014 revival of the Mahdi Army (\"JAM\"; \"Jaish al-Mahdī\") that was created by the Iraqi Shia cleric Muqtada al-Sadr in June 2003 and disbanded in 2008.\n\nThe Mahdi Army rose to international prominence on April 18, 2004, when it spearheaded the first major armed confrontation against the US forces in Iraq from the Shia community. This concerned an uprising that followed the ban of al-Sadr's newspaper and his subsequent attempted arrest, lasting until a truce on June 6. The truce was followed by moves to disband the group and transform al-Sadr's movement into a political party to take part in the 2005 elections; Muqtada al-Sadr ordered fighters of the Mahdi army to cease fire unless attacked first. The truce broke down in August 2004 after provocative actions by the Mahdi Army, with new hostilities erupting. The group was disbanded in 2008, following a crackdown by Iraqi security forces.\n\nAt its height, the Mahdi Army's popularity was strong enough to influence local government, the police, and cooperation with Sunni Iraqis and their supporters. The group was popular among Iraqi police forces. The National Independent Cadres and Elites party that ran in the 2005 Iraqi election was closely linked with the army. Members of the Mahdi Army frequently carried out atrocities, particularly against Sunni civilians. The Mahdi Army were accused of operating death squads.\n\nThe group was armed with various light weapons, including improvised explosive devices (IEDs). Many of the IEDs used during attacks on Iraqi Security Forces and Coalition Forces used infra-red sensors as triggers, a technique that was used widely by the IRA in Northern Ireland in the early-to-mid-1990s.\n\nThe group was re-mobilized in 2014 in order to fight against the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant and was still active as of 2016. It participated in the recapture of Jurf Al Nasr and the Second Battle of Tikrit.\n\nIn the Twelver school of Shia Islam, the Mahdī is believed to have been a historical figure identified with the Twelfth Imām, Muhammad al-Mahdī, and is therefore called \"al-Imām al-Mahdī\". It is believed that he is still present on earth \"in occultation\" (i.e., hidden), and will emerge again in the end times. Those Shi`ites of this school believe that the Imām Mahdī is the rightful ruler of the whole Islamic community (\"ummah\") at any given time, and he is therefore also called \"Imām al-Zamān\", meaning \"Imām of the Age/Time.\"\n\nCreated by Muqtada al-Sadr and a small faction of Shi'ites, the Mahdi Army began as a group of roughly 500 seminary students connected with Muqtada al-Sadr in the Sadr City district of Baghdad, formerly known as Saddam City. The group moved in to fill the security vacuum in Sadr City and in a string of southern Iraqi cities following the fall of Baghdad to U.S-led coalition forces on April 9, 2003. The group was involved in dispensing aid to Iraqis and provided security in the Shi'ite slums from looters.\n\nGradually, the militia grew and al-Sadr formalized it in June 2003. The Mahdi Army grew into a sizable force of up to 10,000 who even operated what amounted to a shadow government in some areas. Al-Sadr's preaching is critical of the US occupation, but he did not initially join the Sunni Islamist and Baathist guerrillas in their attacks on coalition forces.\n\nSadr's position changed dramatically, however, by the beginning of April 2004. Following the closure of the Sadr-owned newspaper \"al-Hawza\" and the arrest of one of his senior aides, Sadr gave an unusually heated sermon to his followers on April 2. The next day, violent protests occurred throughout the Shi'ite south that soon spilled over into a violent uprising by Mahdi Army militiamen, fully underway by April 4.\n\nThe Mahdi Army forces began an offensive in Najaf, Kufa, Kut, and Sadr City, seizing control of public buildings and police stations while clashing with coalition forces. The militants gained partial control of Karbala after fighting there. Other coalition forces came under attack in Nasiriyah, Amarah and Basra. Najaf and Kufa were quickly seized after a few firefights with Spanish troops, and Kut was seized after clashes with Ukrainian troops soon afterwards.\n\nAfter sporadic clashes, coalition forces temporarily suppressed most militia activity in Nasiriyah, Amarah, and Basra. Mahdi rebels expelled Iraqi police from three police stations and ambushed U.S. forces in Sadr City, killing seven U.S. troops and wounding several more. U.S. forces subsequently regained control of the police stations after running firefights with the fighters, killing dozens of Mahdi militiamen. However, Mahdi Army members still maintained some influence over many of the slum areas of Sadr City.\n\nOn April 16, Kut was retaken by US forces, and several dozen Mahdi Army members were killed in the battle. However, the area around Najaf and Kufa along with Karbala remained under the control of Sadr's forces. Sadr himself was believed to be in Najaf. Coalition troops cordoned off Najaf with 2,500 troops, but reduced the number of forces to pursue negotiations with the Mahdi Army. At the beginning of May, coalition forces estimated that there were 200–500 militants still present in Karbala, 300–400 in Diwaniyah, an unknown number still left in Amarah and Basra, and 1,000–2,000 still in the Najaf-Kufa region.\n\nOn May 4, coalition forces began a counter-offensive to eliminate the Mahdi Army in southern Iraq following a breakdown in negotiations. The first wave began with simultaneous raids in Karbala and Diwaniyah on militia forces, followed by a second wave on May 5 in Karbala and more attacks that seized the governor's office in Najaf on May 6. 86 militiamen were estimated killed in the fighting along with 4 U.S. soldiers. Several high-ranking militia commanders were also killed in a separate raid by US Special Operations units. On May 8, U.S. forces launched a follow-up offensive into Karbala, launching a two-pronged attack into the city. U.S. tanks also launched an incursion into Sadr City. At the same time, perhaps as a diversionary tactic, hundreds of Mahdi Army members swept through Basra, firing on British patrols and seizing parts of the city. Two militants were killed and several British troops were wounded.\n\nOn May 24, after suffering heavy losses in weeks of fighting, Mahdi Army forces withdrew from the city of Karbala. This left the only area still under their firm control being the Najaf-Kufa region, also under sustained American assault. Several hundred Mahdi Army militia in total were killed. Unfazed by the fighting, Muqtada al-Sadr regularly gave Friday sermons in Kufa throughout the uprising.\n\nOn June 6, 2004, Muqtada al-Sadr issued an announcement directing the Mahdi Army to cease operations in Najaf and Kufa. Remnants of the militia soon ceased bearing arms and halted the attacks on U.S. forces. Gradually, militiamen left the area or went back to their homes. On the same day, Brigadier General Mark Hertling, a top US commander in charge of Najaf, Iraq, stated \"The Muqtada militia is militarily defeated. We have killed scores of them over the last few weeks, and that is in Najaf alone. [...] The militia have been defeated, or have left.\" June 6 effectively marked the end of Shi'ite uprising. The total number of Mahdi Army militiamen killed in the fighting across Iraq is estimated at between 1,500 and 2,000. \n\nThe return of Najaf to Iraqi security forces following the cease-fire left Sadr City as the last bastion of Mahdi Army guerrillas still pursuing violent resistance. Clashes continued periodically in the district following the end of the Najaf-Kufa battles. On June 24, Mahdi Army declared an end to operations in Sadr City as well, effectively ending militia activity, at least for the time being.\n\nAfter the June 4 truce with the occupation forces, al-Sadr took steps to disband the Mahdi Army. In a statement, he called on militia members from outside Najaf to \"do their duty\" and go home. US forces in Najaf were then replaced by Iraqi police. Al-Sadr told supporters not to attack Iraqi security forces and announced his intention to form a party and enter the 2005 elections. He said the interim government was an opportunity to build a unified Iraq. Interim President Ghazi Yawer gave assurances that al-Sadr could join the political process provided he abandoned his militia. Iraqi officials also assured al-Sadr that he was not to face arrest.\n\nAfter Sadr's militia besieged a police station in Najaf and the local governor called for assistance, the US military intervened again. US troops arrested Sadr's representative in Karbala, Sheikh Mithal al Hasnawi on July 31 and surrounded al-Sadr's home on August 3. British troops in Basra also moved against al-Sadr followers, arresting four on August 3. After the expiration of a noon deadline to release them on August 5, the Basra militiamen declared holy war on British forces.\n\nOn August 5, via his spokesman Ahmed al-Shaibany, al-Sadr re-affirmed his commitment to the truce and called on US forces to honour the truce. He announced that if the restoration of the cease-fire failed \"then the firing and igniting of the revolution will continue\". The offer was rejected by the governor of Najaf, Adnan al-Zurufi (\"There is no compromise or room for another truce\") and US officials (\"This is one battle we really do feel we can win\").\n\nIn the days that followed fighting continued around the old city of Najaf, in particular at the Imam Ali shrine and the cemetery. The Mahdi Army, estimated at 2,000 in Najaf, was outnumbered by some 2,000 US troops and 1,800 Iraqi security forces, and at a disadvantage due to the vastly superior American tactics, training, firepower and air power, such as helicopters and AC-130 gunships. On August 13, the militia was trapped in a cordon around the Imam Ali shrine. While negotiations continued between the interim government and the Mahdi Army, news came that al-Sadr had been wounded.\n\nOn August 12, British journalist James Brandon, a reporter for the Sunday Telegraph was kidnapped in Basra by unidentified militants. A video tape was released, featuring Brandon and a hooded militant, threatening to kill the British hostage unless US forces withdrew from Najaf within 24 hours. In a feature, Brandon describes being beaten, pistol-whipped, and forced to participate in mock executions. He said he escaped after holding a woman at knife-point, to a government building where guards found him, but they phoned his kidnappers, who arrived to collect him. Despite telling them repeatedly that he was a journalist, they assumed he was a spy or agent for the occupation until they saw a report about the kidnap on al-Arabiya television. Afterward, Brandon's treatment improved markedly and he was released after less than a day, following intervention by al-Sadr. At a press conference, Brandon commented on his treatment and thanked his kidnappers: \"Initially I was treated roughly, but once they knew I was a journalist I was treated very well and I want to say thank you to the people who kidnapped me.\" A spokesman for al-Sadr said: \"We apologise for what happened to you. This is not our tradition, not our rules. It is not the tradition of Islam.\" Brandon was delivered to the British military police who gave him medical treatment and escorted him to Kuwait the following day. Brandon planned to see his family and go on holiday, but said he wanted to return to Iraq : \"Only next time, I just want to do the reporting. I have no desire to be the story again.\"\n\nThe fact that American troops surrounded the Shrine led to an impasse as the Mahdi army could not leave the shrine and US troops did not want to offend Islam by setting foot inside the shrine. The standoff did not end for three weeks until Sistani emerged from convalescence in London and brokered an agreement between the two forces.\n\nThe uprising seemed to draw an ambivalent reaction from the Iraqi population, which for the most part neither joined nor resisted the rebels. Many Iraqi security forces melted away, wishing to avoid confrontation. In a sign of Mahdi Army's unpopularity in Najaf, however, which follows more traditionalist clerics, a small covert movement sprung up to launch attacks on the militants. The uprising did receive a good deal of support from Shiite radicals in Baghdad, however, who were galvanized by the simultaneous siege of the city of Fallujah.\n\nLoyalists to al-Sadr ran under the National Independent Cadres and Elites banner in the 2005 Iraqi election. Though a number of the movements supporters felt that the election was invalid. The party finished sixth overall in the election and was represented in the transitional legislature. Another twenty or so candidates aligned with al-Sadr ran for the United Iraqi Alliance.\n\nThe movement is believed to have infiltrated the Iraqi police forces, and to have been involved in the September 2005 arrest of two British soldiers by Iraqi police.\n\nOn December 4, 2005, former Prime Minister Iyad Allawi was assaulted by a mob in Najaf, where the Mahdi Army is influential.\n\nIn mid October, a roadside bomb killed Qassim al-Tamimi, the chief of investigations for the provincial police force and a member of the rival Badr Organization. Badr fighters blamed the Mahdi Army for the killing and in response to this, the police captured a brother of the suspected bomber, who was a member of the Mahdi Army. Fighting began on October 17, when 800 masked members of the Mahdi army stormed three police stations in Amarah. Several firefights occurred between the militia and police over the course of the next four days.\n\nBy the morning of October 20, 2006, local leaders and residents said that victorious Mahdi fighters were patrolling the city on foot and in commandeered police vehicles and were setting up roadblocks. Sheik al-Muhamadawi stated early October 20 that \"there is no state in the city. Policemen do not have enough weapons and ammunition compared with the militia, which has all kinds of weapons.\" At least 27 people were killed and 118 wounded in the clashes.\n\nThe Mahdi Army eventually withdrew from their positions in Amarah following negotiations between local tribal and political leaders and representatives from the Baghdad offices of Prime Minister Nuri Kamal al-Maliki. A battalion from the Iraqi Army sent from Basra then took control of the city.\n\nThe stunning and defiant display of militia strength underscored the weaknesses of the Iraqi security forces and the potency of the Mahdi Army, which had been able to operate virtually unchecked in Iraq. This caused many to accuse the Mahdi Army of starting the Civil War in Iraq.\n\nIn August 2007, during fighting between the Mahdi Army and Iraqi police in Karbala, Muqtada al-Sadr called for a ceasefire and urged Mahdi Army members to stop fighting. The cease-fire has been credited with helping to reduce violence in Iraq between the Mahdi Army and Iraqi Army since August 2007. Amid fears of the ending of the ceasefire in February 2008, it was extended for a further six months by al-Sadr on February 22, 2008.\n\nOn 25 March 2008, thousands of Iraqi troops carried out a military strike against the Mahdi Army in their stronghold of Basra. This operation, code named Operation Charge of the Knights, was the first of its kind since British troops withdrew from the city centre.\n\nClashes took place between security forces and the militants loyal to Muqtada al-Sadr after a dawn military offensive in the southern city. In Al-Sadr's headquarters of Najaf, the cleric ordered the field commanders of his Mahdi Army militia to go to 'maximum alert' and prepare \"to strike the occupiers\". Gunmen also reportedly clashed with Iraqi police in the southern city of Kut.\n\nThe Mahdi Army launched a nationwide civil disobedience campaign across Iraq to protest raids and detentions against the Mahdi Army. The discord threatened to unravel al-Sadr's ceasefire, spark renewed sectarian violence, and prompt the United States to delay troop withdrawals. Violent rivalries among Shiites had been predicted by many observers ahead of the Iraqi governorate elections, 2008, which were to be held by October 1, 2008.\n\nConcurrently, on April 6, Iraqi and U.S. forces moved into the southern third of Sadr City to prevent rocket and mortar fire from the area against the Green Zone. U.S. engineers began construction of a concrete barrier along al-Quds Street to seal the southern third of the city off and allow reconstruction to take place. Over the next month, the Mahdi Army launched a number of attacks on the troops building the barrier, but sustained heavy losses. On May 11, al-Sadr concluded a cease-fire agreement with Iraqi security forces, ending the battle. Mahdi Army losses were estimated at between 700 and 1,000 casualties.\n\nOn August 28, 2008, al-Sadr ordered the Mahdi Army to suspend military activity indefinitely. Later, however, al-Sadr created either two or three new organizations to take the place of the Mahdi Army: the Promised Day Brigades, established in November 2008 as a militia, and the Muhamidoon, which focuses on social work and religious education. A 2010 Associated Press report also mentioned a third wing, the Monaseroun, responsible for \"the mobilization of supporters.\"\n\nSince 2008, rumors of a Mahdi Army resurgence have cropped up periodically. In April 2010, after winning 40 of 325 seats in the 2010 parliamentary elections, Sadr called for its reestablishment.\n\nIn 2014 al-Sadr called for the formation of \"Peace Companies\", often mistranslated \"Peace Brigades\", to protect Shia shrines from the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant. In June 2014, these Peace Companies marched in Sadr City, a slum in Baghdad infamous for being the prime Mahdi Army center of operations during the Iraq War. In addition to guarding shrines, the Peace Companies participated in offensive operations such as the recapture of Jurf Al Nasr in October 2014. They suspended their activities temporarily in February 2015, but were active in the Second Battle of Tikrit in March.\n\nAlthough Muqtada Al-Sadr has historically had close ties to Iran, he has generally opposed Iranian clerical and political influence in Iraq. Unlike the Al-Hakim family, of the Supreme Iraqi Islamic Council and many leaders of the Dawa party who fled to Iran following the Persian Gulf War and remained there in exile until the American invasion in 2003, Muqtada al-Sadr and his family remained in Iraq throughout Saddam's rule. The refusal to leave Iraq garnered the Sadr family much support during and after the collapse of Saddam's regime. Early 2006, al-Sadr pledged military support to Iran and other neighboring Islamic countries if they were to be attacked by a foreign nation. Since then, however, Al-Sadr has opposed the Dawa Party, and In 2006 Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki ordered a major offensive targeting the Mahdi Army in Basra.\n\nIn late 2007 or 2008, Muqtada al-Sadr moved to Iran and spent several years studying Shia jurisprudence in Qom before returning to Najaf in 2011.\n\nAs of August 2006, the Mahdi Army rarely challenged coalition troops on a wide scale. Neither the coalition nor the Iraqi government made any move to arrest al-Sadr. The Mahdi Army participated in battles against Sunni insurgents and operated its own justice system in the areas it controlled. The Mahdi army operated death squads that frequently killed Sunni civilians particularly during the civil war phase of the Iraq war.\n\nWhen reporting on an early October 2006 clash between the Mahdi Army and Coalition troops in Diwaniyah, BBC news suggested that at the time, the Mahdi Army was not a homogeneous force, with local groups apparently acting on own initiative.\n\nIn September 2006, a senior coalition intelligence official had remarked to reporters how there were political fractures within Al-Sadr's organization in protest of his relatively moderate political course of action, with one coalition intelligence official claiming that at least six major leaders no longer answer to al-Sadr and as many as a third of the army was now out of his direct control.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "14711705", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=14711705", "title": "Predicting the timing of peak oil", "text": "Predicting the timing of peak oil\n\nPeak oil is the point at which oil production, sometimes including unconventional oil sources, hits its maximum. Predicting the timing of peak oil involves estimation of future production from existing oil fields as well as future discoveries. The most influential production model is Hubbert peak theory, first proposed in the 1950s. The effect of peak oil on the world economy remains controversial.\n\nThere was a consensus between industry leaders and analysts that world oil production would peak between 2010 and 2030, with a significant chance that the peak will occur before 2020. Dates after 2030 were considered implausible by some. Determining a more specific range is difficult due to the lack of certainty over the actual size of world oil reserves. Unconventional oil is not currently predicted to meet the expected shortfall even in a best-case scenario. For unconventional oil to fill the gap without \"potentially serious impacts on the global economy\", oil production would have to remain stable after its peak, until 2035 at the earliest.\n\nOn the other hand, the US Energy Information Administration projected in 2014 that world production of “total liquids,” which, in addition to liquid petroleum, includes biofuels, natural gas liquids, and oil sands, would increase at an average rate of about one percent per year through 2040 without peaking. OPEC countries are expected to increase oil production at a faster rate than non-OPEC countries.\n\nGiven the large range offered by meta-studies, papers published since 2010 have been relatively pessimistic. A 2010 Kuwait University study predicted production would peak in 2014. A 2010 Oxford University study predicted that production will peak before 2015. A 2014 validation of a significant 2004 study in the journal \"Energy\" proposed that it is likely that conventional oil production peaked, according to various definitions, between 2005 and 2011. Models which show a continued increase in oil production may be including both conventional and non-conventional oil. A set of models published in a 2014 Ph.D. thesis predicted that a 2012 peak would be followed by a drop in oil prices, which in some scenarios could turn into a rapid rise in prices thereafter.\n\nPhibro statistics show that major oil companies hit peak production in 2005. Fatih Birol, chief economist at the International Energy Agency, stated in 2011 that \"crude oil production for the world has already peaked in 2006.\"\n\nThe idea that human use of petroleum faces sustainability limits attracted practical concern at least as early as the 1880s, as did the related idea that the timing of those limits depends on the extraction technology. The concept of exhausting a natural resource to a point of diminishing returns had some antecedent examples. During the same decades when the modern petroleum industry was launching, the New England whale oil industry had just experienced a peak and was grappling with decline.\n\nEconomist and oil analyst Daniel Yergin notes that the first predictions of imminent oil peaks go back to the 1880s, when some American experts believed that exhaustion of the Pennsylvania oil fields would kill the US oil industry. Another wave of peak predictions occurred after World War I.\n\nA correspondent named W.D. Hornaday, quoting oil industry executive J.S. Cullinan, described the concerns in a 1918 article for \"Tractor and Gas Engine Review\" titled \"Petroleum consumption enormous.\" The article said, \"There has been considerable discussion of late as to the possible length of time that the petroleum supply of the United States and the world will hold out.\" The article quoted Cullinan as saying, \"It is just possible, so far as the United States is concerned, that the development and the exhaustion of the supplies may occur within the course of one human life. It is certain that unless radical changes from present methods are applied promptly, all sources of supply within the range of known drilling methods will be exhausted during the life of your children and mine.\" It turned out that radical changes from 1910s drilling methods were, in fact, applied promptly, and thus, the predicted timeframe was premature; but the underlying concerns (that the vastness of consumption would lead to shortages soon enough to worry about, regardless of the exact decade) did not disappear.\n\nIn 1956, M. King Hubbert created and first used the models behind peak oil to predict that United States oil production would peak between 1965 and 1971.\n\nIn 1956, Hubbert calculated that the world held an ultimate cumulative of 1.25 trillion barrels, of which 124 billion had already been produced. He projected that world oil production would peak at about 12.5 billion barrels per year, sometime around the year 2000. He repeated the prediction in 1962. World oil production surpassed his predicted peak in 1967 and kept rising; world oil production did not peak on or near the year 2000, and for the year 2012 was 26.67 billion barrels, more that twice the peak rate Hubbert had projected back in 1956.\n\nIn 1974, Hubbert again predicted that world peak oil would occur near 2000, this time in 1995 \"if current trends continue.\" However, in the late 1970s and early 1980s, global oil consumption actually dropped (due to the shift to energy-efficient cars, the shift to electricity and natural gas for heating, and other factors), then rebounded with a lower rate of growth in the mid 1980s. Thus oil production did not peak in 1995, and has climbed to more than double the rate initially projected.\n\nIn 2001, Kenneth S. Deffeyes, professor emeritus of geology at Princeton University, used Hubbert’s theory to predict that world oil production would peak about 2005, with a possible range of 2003 to 2006. He used the observed growth of production plus reserves to calculate ultimate world oil production of 2.12 trillion barrels, noting: \"No educated guesses go in.\" He considered the application of new technology, but wrote: \"This much is certain: no initiative put in place starting today can have a substantial effect on the peak production year.\" His final conclusion was: \"There is nothing plausible that could postpone the peak until 2009. Get used to it.\" As of late 2009, Deffeyes was still convinced that 2005 had been the peak, and wrote: “I think it unlikely that oil production will ever climb back to the 2005 levels.”\n\nMatthew Simmons said on October 26, 2006 that global oil production may have peaked in December 2005, though he cautioned that further monitoring of production is required to determine if a peak has actually occurred.\nThe July 2007 IEA Medium-Term Oil Market Report projected a 2% non-OPEC liquids supply growth in 2007-2009, reaching in 2008, receding thereafter as the slate of verifiable investment projects diminishes. They refer to this decline as a plateau. The report expects only a small amount of supply growth from OPEC producers, with 70% of the increase coming from Saudi Arabia, the UAE, and Angola as security and investment issues continue to impinge on oil exports from Iraq, Nigeria and Venezuela.\nIn October 2007, the Energy Watch Group, a German research group founded by MP Hans-Josef Fell, released a report claiming that oil production peaked in 2006 and would decline by several percent annually. The authors predicted negative economic effects and social unrest as a result. They stated that the IEA production plateau prediction uses purely economic models, which rely on an ability to raise production and discovery rates at will.\n\nSadad Ibrahim Al Husseini, former head of Saudi Aramco's production and exploration, stated in an October 29, 2007 interview that oil production had likely already reached its peak in 2006, and that assumptions by the IEA and EIA of production increases by OPEC to over are \"quite unrealistic.\" Data from the United States Energy Information Administration show that world production leveled out in 2004, and an October 2007 retrospective report by the Energy Watch Group concluded that this data showed the peak of conventional oil production in the third quarter of 2006.\n\nASPO predicted in their January 2008 newsletter that the peak in all oil (including non-conventional sources), would occur in 2010. This is earlier than the July 2007 newsletter prediction of 2011. ASPO Ireland in its May 2008 newsletter, number 89, revised its depletion model and advanced the date of the peak of overall liquids from 2010 to 2007.\n\nTexas alternative energy activist and oilman T. Boone Pickens stated in 2005 that worldwide conventional oil production was very close to peaking. On June 17, 2008, in testimony before the U.S. Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee, Pickens stated that \"I do believe you have peaked out at 85 million barrels a day globally.\"\n\nThe UK Industry Taskforce on Peak Oil and Energy Security (ITPOES) reported in late October 2008 that peak oil is likely to occur by 2013. ITPOES consists of eight companies: Arup, FirstGroup, Foster + Partners, Scottish and Southern Energy, Solarcentury, Stagecoach Group, Virgin Group, and Yahoo. Their report includes a chapter written by Shell corporation.\n\nIn October 2009, a report published by the Government-supported UK Energy Research Centre, following 'a review of over 500 studies, analysis of industry databases and comparison of global supply forecasts', concluded that 'a peak in conventional oil production before 2030 appears likely and there is a significant risk of a peak before 2020'. The authors believe this forecast to be valid 'despite the large uncertainties in the available data'. The study was claimed to be the first to undertake an 'independent, thorough and systematic review of the evidence and arguments in the 'peak oil’ debate'. The authors noted that 'forecasts that delay a peak in conventional oil production until after 2030 are at best optimistic and at worst implausible' and warn of the risk that 'rising oil prices will encourage the rapid development of carbon-intensive alternatives that will make it difficult or impossible to prevent dangerous climate change and that 'early investment in low-carbon alternatives to conventional oil is of considerable importance' in avoiding this scenario.\n\nNon-'peakists' can be divided into several different categories based on their specific criticism of peak oil. Some claim that any peak will not come soon or have a dramatic effect on the world economies. Others claim we will not reach a peak for technological reasons, while still others claim our oil reserves are quickly regenerated abiotically.\n\nCERA, which counts unconventional sources in reserves while discounting EROEI, believes that global production will eventually follow an “undulating plateau” for one or more decades before declining slowly. In 2005 the group predicted that \"petroleum supplies will be expanding faster than demand over the next five years.\"\n\nIn 2007, \"The Wall Street Journal\" reported that \"a growing number of oil-industry chieftains\" believed that oil production would soon reach a ceiling for a variety of reasons, and plateau at that level for some time. Several chief executives stated that projections of over of production per day are unrealistic, contradicting the projections of the International Energy Agency and United States Energy Information Administration.\n\nIt has been argued that even a \"plateau oil\" scenario may cause political and economic disruption due to increasing petroleum demand and price volatility.\n\nThe United States Energy Information Administration projects (as of 2006) world consumption of oil to increase to in 2015 and in 2030. This would require a more than 35 percent increase in world oil production by 2030. A 2004 paper by the Energy Information Administration based on data collected in 2000 disagrees with Hubbert peak theory on several points. It:\n\nThe EIA estimates of future oil supply are disagreed with by Sadad Ibrahim Al Husseini, a retired Vice President of Exploration of Aramco, who called it a 'dangerous over-estimate'. Husseini also pointed out that population growth and the emergence of China and India means oil prices are now going to be structurally higher than they have been.\n\nColin Campbell argued that the 2000 United States Geological Survey (USGS) estimates was a methodologically flawed study that has done incalculable damage by misleading international agencies and governments. Campbell dismisses the notion that the world can seamlessly move to more difficult and expensive sources of oil and gas when the need arises. He argued that oil is in profitable abundance or not there at all, due ultimately to the fact that it is a liquid concentrated by nature in a few places that possess the right geological conditions. Campbell believes OPEC countries raised their reserves to get higher oil quotas and to avoid internal critique. He has also pointed out that the USGS failed to extrapolate past discovery trends in the world’s mature basins. He concluded (2002) that peak production was \"imminent.\" Campbell's own record is that he successively predicted that the peak in world production would occur in 1989, 2004, and 2010.\n\nThe 2008 \"World Energy Outlook\" of the International Energy Agency suggested that there was sufficient oil supply to meet demand at reasonable prices for the foreseeable future. This was critiqued by K. Aleklett and M. Höök, but their critique has itself been accused of bias towards non-representative depletion rates, with the result that their figures are ill-founded. Subsequent research clarified more on depletion rates and different ways to define them, but still showed that it rests on solid scientific ground. Ultimately, much of the criticism raised by Uppsala has been addressed and corrected for by the IEA as the same group has thoroughly reviewed oil projections in the IEA World Energy Outlook while remaining uncertainties are chiefly attributable to OPEC and unconventional oil .\n\nAccording to the \"World Energy Outlook 2010\", conventional crude oil production peaked in 2006, with al all-time maximum of 70 millions of barrels per day.\n\nThe view that oil extraction will never enter a depletion phase is often referred to as \"cornucopian\" in ecology and sustainability literature.\n\nAbdullah S. Jum'ah, President, Director and CEO of Saudi Aramco states that the world has adequate reserves of conventional and nonconventional oil sources that will last for more than a century.\nAs recently as 2008 he pronounced \"We have grossly underestimated mankind’s ability to find new reserves of petroleum, as well as our capacity to raise recovery rates and tap fields once thought inaccessible or impossible to produce.” Jum’ah believes that in-place conventional and non-conventional liquid resources may ultimately total between 13 trillion and and that only a small fraction (1.1 trillion) has been extracted to date.\n\nEconomist Michael Lynch says that the Hubbert Peak theory is flawed and that there is no imminent peak in oil production. He argued in 2004 that production is determined by demand as well as geology, and that fluctuations in oil supply are due to political and economic effects as well as the physical processes of exploration, discovery and production. This idea is echoed by Jad Mouawad, who explains that as oil prices rise, new extraction technologies become viable, thus expanding the total recoverable oil reserves. This, according to Mouwad, is one explanation of the changes in peak production estimates.\n\nLeonardo Maugeri, the former group senior vice president, Corporate Strategies of Eni S.p.A., dismissed the peak oil thesis in a 2004 policy position piece in Science as \"the current model of oil doomsters,\" and based on several flawed assumptions. He characterized the peak oil theory as part of a series of \"recurring oil panics\" that have \"driven Western political circles toward oil imperialism and attempts to assert direct or indirect control over oil-producing regions\". Maugeri claimed the geological structure of the earth has not been explored thoroughly enough to conclude that the declining trend in discoveries, which began in the 1960s, will continue. He also stated that complete global oil production, discovery trends, and geological data are not available globally.\n\nEconomist and oil analyst Daniel Yergin criticizes Hubbert peak oil theory for ignoring the effects of both economics and improved technology. Yergin believes that world oil production will continue to rise until “perhaps sometime around mid-century” and then “plateau” or enter a gradual decline. He considers it possible that declining oil production, when it comes, will be caused less by resource scarcity than by lower demand brought about by improved efficiency.\n\nThe theory that petroleum derives from biogenic processes is held by the overwhelming majority of petroleum geologists. However, abiogenic theorists, such as the late professor of astronomy Thomas Gold, assert that oil may be a continually renewing abiotic product, rather than a “fossil fuel” in limited supply. They hypothesize that if abiogenic petroleum sources are found and are quick to replenish, petroleum production will not decline. Gold was not able to prove his theories in experiments\n\nOne of the main counter arguments to the abiotic theory is the existence of biomarkers in petroleum. These chemical compounds can be best explained as residues of biogenic organic matter. They have been found in all oil and gas accumulations tested so far and suggest that oil has a biological origin and is generated from kerogen by pyrolysis.\n\nPeak Oil as a concept applies globally, but it is based on the summation of individual nations experiencing peak oil.\nIn \"State of the World 2005\", Worldwatch Institute observed that oil production was in decline in 33 of the 48 largest oil-producing countries. Other countries have also passed their individual oil production peaks.\n\nThe following list shows some oil-producing nations and their peak oil production years.\n\n\nPeak oil production has not been reached in the following nations (and is estimated in a 2010 Kuwait University study to occur in the following years):\n\nIn addition, the most recent International Energy Agency and US Energy Information Administration production data show record and rising production in Canada and China. While conventional oil production from Canada is listed as peaking in 1973, oil sands production are expected to permit increasing production until at least 2020 - see also the graph \"Canadian Oil Production\".\n\nAn ABC television program in 2006 predicted that Russia would hit peak in 2010, it has continued to rise through 2016.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "12541870", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=12541870", "title": "Sandra Laing", "text": "Sandra Laing\n\nSandra Laing (born 1955) is a South African woman who was classified as coloured by authorities during the apartheid era, due to her skin colour and hair texture, although she was the child of at least three generations of ancestors who had been regarded as white. At the age of 10, she was expelled from her all-white school, and the authorities' decisions based on her appearance disrupted her family and adult life.\n\nLaing was the subject of the 2008 biographical dramatic film \"Skin\", directed by Anthony Fabian, which won numerous awards. In addition, she is the subject of the documentaries \"In Search of Sandra Laing\" (1977), directed by Anthony Thomas for the BBC, which was banned by the apartheid government of the time, \"Sandra Laing: A Spiritual Journey\" (2000), and \"Skin Deep: The Story of Sandra Laing\" (2009).\n\nSandra Laing was born in 1955 to Sannie and Abraham Laing, Afrikaners in Piet Retief, a small conservative town in South Africa during the apartheid era, when laws governed officially established social castes of racial classification. She had darker skin than other members of her family, which seemed to become more obvious as she grew older. Her parents, grandparents, and great-grandparents were all white, but Sandra displayed the physiognomy of African ancestors of earlier generations, perhaps from the 18th century or more recent. Her family treated her as white, the same as their sons Adriaan and Leon, and together they all attended the Dutch Reformed Church.\n\nWhen Laing was 10 years old and at an all-white boarding school, the school authorities expelled her because of complaints from the parents of other students, based on her appearance: primarily her skin colour and the texture of her hair. They believed she was \"coloured\", a term for mixed-race people. She was expelled and escorted home by two police officers.\n\nSandra's parents fought several legal battles to have her classified as white, based on her documented ancestry through them. Her father underwent a blood-typing test for paternity in the 1960s, as DNA tests were not yet available. The results were compatible with his being her biological father, though such tests are extremely imprecise due to the small number of blood types that most people have.\n\nAfter the publicity, Laing found herself shunned by the white community, although she was re-classified as white again in 1966 when the law was changed to allow a person to be classified as white if both parents are classified as white. She attended a coloured boarding school away from her family and became immersed in the non-white world. Her only friends were the children of black employees. At the age of 16, Laing eloped to Swaziland with Petrus Zwane, a black South African who spoke Zulu. She was jailed for three months for illegal border-crossing. Her father threatened to kill her for the marriage and broke off contact with her. They never met again.\n\nAlthough she and her husband had two children, who were classified as \"coloured\", she was threatened with losing them unless she also was classified as \"coloured\", as a white parent could not raise coloured children. At the age of 26, she arranged for the change in race classification officially, although her father had refused permission earlier. Except for secret trips to see her mother when her father was out of the house, Laing was estranged from her family and struggled to survive economically. When her parents moved away from Piet Retief, the clandestine visits were no longer possible. Laing lost contact with her family completely. \n\nLaing and her husband separated due to the pressures they were under, and she put their children into government care for a period. Years later she married again, to Johannes Motloung, a Sotho-speaking man. They had three children together and she was able to reclaim her first two; all are now grown and with families of their own. Trying to reconcile with her family in the 1980s, Laing learned that her father had died and her mother Sannie refused to see her.\n\nIn 2000 the \"Johannesburg Times\" tracked down Laing to learn about her years since the end of apartheid. The newspaper helped her find her mother, and they were able to reconcile. Sannie was then in a nursing home. Sannie and the two shared time together before her mother's death in 2001.\n\nThe publicity helped Laing, her husband and family gain new housing; they now live in Leachville, new estates east of Johannesburg. In 2009, it was reported that Laing's brothers still refused to see her. She has said in interviews with \"The Guardian\" and \"Little White Lies\" that she continued to hope they would some day have a change of heart.\n\nDocumentary films have been made about Laing: \nand a dramatic film:\nbased on the book:\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "25116337", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=25116337", "title": "Socialization of animals", "text": "Socialization of animals\n\nSocialization of animals is the process of training animals to be kept by humans in close relationships, especially cats and working dogs.\n\nFeral animals can be socialized with varying degrees of success.\nFeral children are children who lack socially accepted communication skills. Reports of feral children, such as those cited by Kingsley Davis, have largely been shown to be exaggerations, or complete fabrications, with regards to the specific lack of particular skills; for example, bipedalism.\n\nFor example, the cat returns readily to a feral state if it has not been socialized properly in its young life. A feral cat usually acts defensively. People often unknowingly own one and think it is merely \"unfriendly.\"\n\nSocializing cats older than six months can be very difficult. It is often said that they cannot be socialized. This is not true, but the process takes two to four years of diligent food bribes and handling, and mostly on the cat's terms. Eventually the cat may be persuaded to be comfortable with humans and the indoor environment.\n\nKittens learn to be feral either from their mothers or through bad experiences. They are more easily socialized when under six months of age. Socializing is done by keeping them confined in a small room (i.e. bathroom) and handling them for 3 or more hours each day. There are three primary methods for socialization, used individually or in combination. The first method is to simply hold and pet the cat, so it learns that such activities are not uncomfortable. The second is to use food bribes. The final method is to distract the cat with toys while handling them. The cat may then be gradually introduced to larger spaces. It is not recommended to let the cat back outside because that may cause it to revert to its feral state. The process of socialization often takes three weeks to three months for a kitten.\n\nAnimal shelters either foster feral kittens to be socialized or kill them outright. The feral adults are usually killed or euthanized, due to the large time commitment, but some shelters and vets will spay or neuter and vaccinate a feral cat and then return it to the wild.\n\nIn domesticated dogs, the process of socialization begins even before the puppy's eyes open. Socialization refers to both its ability to interact acceptably with humans and its understanding of how to communicate successfully with other dogs. If the mother is fearful of humans or of her environment, she can pass along this fear to her puppies. For most dogs, however, a mother who interacts well with humans is the best teacher that the puppies can have. In addition, puppies learn how to interact with other dogs by their interaction with their mother and with other adult dogs in the house.\n\nA mother's attitude and tolerance of her puppies will change as they grow older and become more active. For this reason most experts today recommend leaving puppies with their mother until at least 8 to 10 weeks of age. This gives them a chance to experience a variety of interactions with their mother, and to observe her behavior in a range of situations.\n\nThe critical period of socialization commences when they are approximately three weeks old and will continue until they are twelve to fourteen weeks old, during which they move to the next stage of development, the juvenile period. This period of socialization is the time when puppies form social bonds, learn to explore and learn when/how to base fear. Additionally, this stage consists of teaching them how to appropriately react and habituate to environmental changes in preparation for adulthood. Habituation is the process when a puppy has gotten used to stimuli in their environment and therefore ignores it, deeming it non-threatening. The puppy’s future personality will be greatly influenced during the socialization period. Their temperament and character is developed throughout this period as well, which will last for the duration of their life. During the socialization stage, all five senses are being stimulated by exposure and desensitization of sights, sounds, tastes, smells and touch of things around them.\n\nIt is critical that human interaction takes place frequently and calmly from the time the puppies are born, from simple, gentle handling to the mere presence of humans in the vicinity of the puppies, performing everyday tasks and activities. As the puppies grow older, socialization occurs more readily the more frequently they are exposed to other dogs, other people, and other situations. Dogs who are well socialized from birth, with both dogs and other species (especially people), are much less likely to be aggressive or to suffer from fear-biting.\n\nThe cognitional development of puppies can be affected when the critical period of socialization is disrupted. Physiological consequences of this period not occurring can lead to puppies maturing to adults who are not able to react appropriately to new environments, situations or people. Additionally, behavioural issues can arise. Aggression, avoidance and fear are just some of the implications that can arise from a puppy not achieving the critical period of socialization. It is estimated that one in four adult dogs have at least one behavioural problem. Dogs are the animal which is typically the most closely attached to humans, developing tightly wound relationships with people. Therefore, it is crucial for the safety of both parties that there is adequate training in place.\n\nDogs experience socialization through the critical period of socialization in two main types: active and passive. Active implies the intended socialization of humans introducing their puppy to something/someone new (i.e. at obedience class or a ride in the car). However, passive involves socialization of the puppy to something/someone new in which they have done so unintentionally themselves (i.e. insects found in the backyard while exploring or items found while running around the house).\n\nDogs will often learn two ways; by association and consequence. Learning by association is classified as classical conditioning, while learning by consequence is called operant conditioning. With puppy socialization, classical conditioning involves pairing something they love with something within the environment. Additionally, operant conditioning involves the puppy learning to do something to achieve getting what they want. These two learning types can occur simultaneously with a puppy having the ability to learn both an internal and external response to a stimulus. In contrast, a puppy can also demonstrate methods of actively avoiding a situation they do not enjoy.\n\nThe researchers, Fox and Stelzner did a socialization experiment on puppies of the same species. The major finding of this experiment is the fact that the puppies weaned from the mother at a later age (12 weeks) have better socialization skills. This proves that the beginning of a puppy's life is a very important time for socialization and will affect their social tendencies for the rest of their lives.\n\nHennessey, Morris, and Linden conducted a socialization experiment using inmates as handlers of the shelter dogs being studied. These researchers found that the dogs in the experimental group did not jump on and bark at unfamiliar humans as much as the dogs in the control group did. The socialized dogs also showed to be more responsive to commands than did the dogs in the control group. The researchers believe that through more effective socialization, more dogs can be adopted from shelters.\n\nBattagalia claims that there are 3 important periods during the first year of life for a puppy. Her research shows that if puppies experience stimulation from humans during the first few months of their lives, they will be less likely to feel stress in their adult lives and they will be better socialized. She claims this is a very important thing for dog breeders to know to improve the success of their puppy's future lives.\n\nA study done by the six researchers, Topál, Gácsi, Miklósi, Zirányi, Kubinyi, and Csányi compares the inherent social tendencies between dog puppies and wolf puppies. What these researchers found was that dog puppies showed attachment to their owners and showed to be more responsive to their owner than an unfamiliar person. The wolf puppies did not show to be more responsive to their owners than to an unfamiliar human. Researchers concluded that this is a genetic difference between species.\n\nThese six researchers attempted to answer the question, \"Why?\" in their next experiment. They found that dogs were more successful in finding hidden food and in completing a learned task than wolves were. The most prominent observation these researchers made was that the dogs would look into the eyes of the human as if looking for a clue and the wolves would not look at the faces of the humans. They concluded that this is a genetic difference between the two species as a result of evolution.\n\nMonkeys are often studied because of the close evolutionary relationship between monkeys and humans.Like humans, some monkeys tend to show declining social activity with age. Research has shown that older females spent less time grooming other and interacted with fewer animals than younger individuals did.\n\nBernstein and Ehardt conducted an experiment on aggressive behavior of rhesus monkeys. They found that the monkeys showed more aggression towards kin than non-kin, mostly from older kin to younger kin. This supports the hypothesis that aggression is used in socialization and correction of inappropriate behaviors in the immature monkeys. If the aggression is no more severe than is needed to correct the behavior, it can improve the survival rate of all the relatives.\n\nIn 1980, Berman researched the mother-infant relationship of rhesus monkeys both in the wild and in captivity. She found many similarities between the two parenting styles but some minor differences. The captive mother has been described as more protective and less willing to let their infant out of their control. The difference that likely has to most effect on this relationship is, the wild monkey has kin around which helps with the socialization of the infant, and the mother in captivity does not. This shows how environmental factors can affect the early socialization of infant rhesus monkeys.\n\nSocialization at a young age has been seen to affect sexual behavior in the adult rhesus monkey, in a study done by, Gold, Wallen, and Goldfoot. This is not seen as prominently in rats, and other small animals as it is in primates. The monkeys have difficulty acting normally even when a sexual opportunity presents itself, this is due to the fact that they have affectional disorders that they do not often overcome.\n\nIt is very difficult to study the lives of isolated children so researchers have turned to studying the effect of total isolation on rhesus monkeys. Completely isolated monkey's first response to stimulus is fear or aggression. They do not learn any normal socio-emotional skills. When these monkeys are able to come in contact with a group, they do not know how to interact and would not be able to survive in a group.\n\n"}

The text began with the words, \"The reason that I'm alive today and can devote all of my energy to the state of Israel is thanks only to God and the Ukrainian Insurgent Army.\" The memoir author writes that she was born in Bolekhiv, near Lvov, the daughter of a rabbi, and she was a childhood friend of Olya, the daughter of a Greek Catholic priest. In 1939, according to the memoir, Stella Krentsbakh graduated from the Philosophy department of the University of Lviv. When the war broke out, she joined the Ukrainian Insurgent Army, where she served as a nurse and an intelligence officer. In the spring of 1945, with the Soviet forces having recaptured the whole of the Ukraine, the NKVD arrested Stella Krentsbach during a meeting she had with a contact in Rozhniativ. She was jailed and sentenced to death, but UPA fighters managed to free her. In the summer of 1945, she crossed the Carpathians with other Ukrainian insurgents and, on the 1st of October, she reached the English zone of occupation in Austria, from where she traveled to Israel. In her new country, according to the memoir, she worked in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.\n\nThe story of Stella Krentsbakh received significant attention in the Ukrainian diaspora press. Journalists attempted to locate her in Israel, but she could not be found. Stories and rumors started circulating in émigré circles that the woman had been murdered in Israel, supposedly for telling the truth about the UPA’s attitude to the Jews. \n\nHistorian Philip Friedman, a survivor of the Holocaust from Western Ukraine, remarked that \"the only data about her was published in an Organization of Ukrainian Nationalists paper.\" He searched through the \"Washington Post\" of that period and could not find the memoirs, as he wrote. After making an inquiry to Israel's Ministry of Foreign Affairs, he received the reply, as he reported, that they never had an employee there by that name and also that a case of a homicide in Israel with a victim by that name was \"entirely unknown.\" Friedman stated he undertook a \"careful analysis of the text\" of the memoir and the examination led him to the conclusion that \"the entire story is a hoax.\" \n\nAs American-Canadian historian John-Paul Himka wrote, Bohdan Kordiuk, one-time leader of the Home Executive of UPA, repudiated the memoirs as fake, soon after their original publication. Kordiuk wrote that “none of the UPA men known to the author of these lines knows the legendary Stella Krenzbach or have heard of her. The Jews do not know her either. It is unlikely that anyone of the tens of thousands of Ukrainian refugees after the war met Stella Krenzbach” and concluded: “It seems to us that until there are proper proofs, the story of Dr. Stella Krenzbach has to be regarded as a mystification.”\n\nBoth supporters and deniers of the veracity of the Stella Krenzbach life story have accused the other side of propaganda.\n\nJewish-Ukrainian poet Moysey Fishbein attributed the disputes of the Krenzbach memoir to \"Russia’s special services\" that \"are seeking to destabilize the situation in Ukraine, undermine its sovereignty and independence, create a negative image of this country, block its integration into European and Euro-Atlantic structures, and turn Ukraine into a dependent and manipulated satellite.\" Fishbein claimed that the Russians \"attribute exceptional importance\" to the so-called “Jewish card,” by seeking to \"set Ukrainians and Jews against each other.\" Fishbein's viewpoint was supported by American political analyst Paul A. Goble.\n\nUkrainian historian Volodymyr Viatrovych has repeatedly proclaimed the veracity and accuracy of the Krenzbach life story, as related in the published text, attributing the denials to those who \"accuse the OUN\" of having been \"anti-Semitic.\"\n\nHistorian and researcher Grzegorz Rossoliński-Liebe denoted the 1957 memoir as \"fake,\" and as being part of the \"memory narrative in which Ukrainians appeared as heroes and victims, but not as perpetrators,\" a narrative that, as he stated, was \"from a political perspective, advantageous to the nationalist factions of the Ukrainian diaspora during the Cold War.\" \n\nJohn-Paul Himka stated that the \"Stella Krentsbakh/Kreutzbach forged biography\" shows that the OUN, the UPA, and their \"promoters\" have to \"resort to falsifications to defend their innocence vis-à-vis the Holocaust,\" which \"indicates that they lack real evidence [in] their possession [about the alleged Jewish element among the nationalist organizations],\" and concluded that \"no one grabs for fig leaves when they are wearing clothes.\"\n"}
{"id": "20194103", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=20194103", "title": "The City Without Jews", "text": "The City Without Jews\n\nDie Stadt ohne Juden (\"The City Without Jews\") is a 1924 Austrian Expressionist film by H. K. Breslauer, based on the book of the same title by Hugo Bettauer. The film is one of the few surviving Expressionist films from Austria and has therefore been well researched. The film was first shown on 25 July 1924 in Vienna.\n\nIn his novel, published in 1922, Hugo Bettauer succeeded in creating a relatively accurate allegorical vision of the near future, although the book was intended as entertainment and as a satirical response to the primitive antisemitism of the 1920s. It immediately became Bettauer's most popular work: it was translated into several languages, and sold over a quarter of a million copies. Shortly after the premiere of the film Hugo Bettauer was murdered by Otto Rothstock, a former member of the Nazi Party, who was lionized by the antisemitic Austrian masses and was released less than two years after having been committed to a psychiatric institution.\n\nIn Austria the Christian Social Party comes to power, and the new Chancellor Dr. Schwerdtfeger, a fanatical antisemite, sees his people as being ruled by the Jews. He therefore has a law passed by the National Assembly forcing all Jews to emigrate by the end of the year. The law is enthusiastically received by the non-Jewish population, and the Jews leave the country. But after a short time a sober reality makes itself felt. Cultural life becomes impoverished: in the theatres only plays by Ludwig Ganghofer and Ludwig Anzengruber are still performed. Many cafes are empty, or are converted into beer halls selling sausages. After an initial upturn, the economy declines, as business has greatly diminished, and has moved to other cities, such as Prague and Budapest. Inflation and unemployment run wild.\n\nThe political characters of the book (although not of the film, to avoid difficulties with censorship) are delineated in such a way as to be identifiable with real politicians of the period: Bundeskanzler Schwerdtfeger, for example, is based on Ignaz Seipel. Besides the political action, the film also dwells on the love relationship between Lotte (Anny Milety), a typical Viennese girl (\"Wiener Mädel\") and the daughter of a member of the National Assembly who voted for the banishment of the Jews, and the Jewish artist Leo Strakosch (Johannes Riemann).\n\nTowards the end of the film, the National Assembly resolves to bring the Jews back again. However, to achieve the necessary two-thirds majority, Lotte and Leo, who has already illegally returned to Austria with forged papers identifying him as a French painter, have to remove the antisemitic parliamentary representative Bernard (played by Hans Moser), which they do by getting him drunk. The drama reaches a peak as he is committed to a psychiatric institution represented in Expressionist scenery, where in a claustrophobic and asymmetrically painted cell, he sees himself threatened by Stars of David.\n\nThis sequence also represents the divergence of the film from the book, as the action of the film is revealed as a dream of the antisemitic Councillor Bernard. This surprising turn of events was described in the original film program as:\n\"In this moment of the highest distress Councillor Bernard awakes from his dream, finds himself in the tavern at a very late hour and says to the baffled Volbert: 'Thank God that stupid dream is over—we are all just people and we don't want hate—we want life—we want to live together in peace.'\"\n\nThe film was made in 1924, about two years after the publication of Bettauer's novel. It differs from the book in several ways: for example, the city in the film is called \"Utopia\", instead of \"Vienna\". The film also has conciliatory happy ending, which is not only the exact opposite of the message of the book, but also represents a surprising and abrupt change of direction within the film itself, the whole of which is thus revealed as the dream of an antisemite who at last comes to the realisation that the Jews are a \"necessary evil\". The reason for these fundamental deviations from the original was to reduce the controversial political impact of the content.\n\nThe film was Hans Moser's second cinematic role. The female lead was played, as so often in Breslauer's films, by Anny (or Anna) Milety, whom he later married (in 1925). The well-known Jewish actors Gisela Werbisek (billed as \"Werbezirk\") and Armin Berg appeared only in minor roles, as Kathi the cook and Isidor the commissionaire. The Expressionist backdrops and decor which characterise some scenes were the work of Julius von Borsody.\n\nOther cast members were Eugen Neufeld (Bundeskanzler Dr. Schwerdtfeger), Karl Thema (Cllr. Linder), Ferdinand Mayerhofer (Cllr. Volbert), Mizi Griebl (Volbert's wife) and Hans Effenberger (Alois Carroni).\n\nThe premiere took place on 25 July 1924 in Vienna, although there were still technical problems with the film. Bettauer and Breslauer, the director, fell out entirely, and Bettauer later refused to acknowledge any connection between the film and his book. The technically inferior prints of the film were often manually cut and shortened by the cinema owners themselves. Nevertheless, the cinema auditoriums were often full, although not only in Austria but also in Berlin (premiere 1926) and New York (premiere 1928, where it was shown as \"The City Without Jews\"), it was very clear that the success of the film was not as great as that of the book. There were sometimes disturbances at performances: National Socialists often threw stinkbombs into the cinemas; in Linz the showing of the film was banned.\n\nA campaign of vilification against Bettauer was instigated, partly because of this film and partly because of his other activities. In the spring of 1925 he was murdered by a Nazi Party member, Otto Rothstock, who was hailed as a hero and despite being found guilty of murder, was soon set free.\n\nIn 1933, the film was shown commercially for the last time, again causing a stir, when it was screened in the Amsterdam theatre \"Carré\" as a protest against Hitler's Germany. This copy of the film is presumably the same as the one discovered in 1991 in the Nederlands Filmmuseum. It was on a cellulose nitrate base and on the point of disintegration, as well as being incomplete. The German Bundesarchiv in Coblenz therefore made an \"emergency copy\", which was then reconstructed on behalf of the Filmarchiv Austria (Austrian Film Archive) by the company HS-ART Digital Service of Graz using the \"DIAMANT\" software developed by Joanneum Research; faded parts were then re-coloured. In October 2008, the film was made available on a portable medium for the first time as part of the DVD series \"Der österreichische Film\".\n\nIn 2015, a copy of the whole film in excellent condition was found in a flea-market in Paris. The Austrian Film Archive organised a crowd-funding campaign to save the film to which more than 700 people contributed more than €86,000 (£72,000; $107,000). This full version of the film was digitally restored and re-released in 2018.\n\n\"In many places the film follows the original book almost word for word, which makes the Utopian ending even more obviously an expression of appeasement. At the end the surprised audience learns that the entire dramatic action only took place in a dream, and thus never really happened. The on-screen happy ending, dictated by compromise, not only negates the meaning of Bettauer's book but also the very real antisemitism that it reflects. Instead it documents a by no means unthinkable and in no way dreamlike reality [...] This surprising turn of the plot, deviating totally from the literary original, which simplifies the action as the content of a dream, cannot merely be regarded as a simple dramatic exigency, but as a prime example of the Austrian soul's ability to repress. This naïve and perhaps crude experiment from 1924 can be taken as a forerunner of what was generally practised after World War II in the country \"ohne Eigenschaften\"\"(Thomas Ballhausen, Günter Krenn, 2006).\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "463198", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=463198", "title": "The Gospel of Wealth", "text": "The Gospel of Wealth\n\n\"Wealth\", more commonly known as \"The Gospel of Wealth\", is an article written by Andrew Carnegie in June of 1889 that describes the responsibility of philanthropy by the new upper class of self-made rich. Carnegie proposed that the best way of dealing with the new phenomenon of wealth inequality was for the wealthy to utilize their surplus means in a responsible and thoughtful manner. This approach was contrasted with traditional bequest (patrimony), where wealth is handed down to heirs, and other forms of bequest e.g. where wealth is willed to the state for public purposes. Benjamin Soskis, a historian of philanthropy, refers to the article as the 'urtext' of modern philanthropy.\n\nCarnegie argued that surplus wealth is put to best use (i.e. produces the greatest net benefit to society) when it is administered carefully by the wealthy. Carnegie also argues against wasteful use of capital in the form of extravagance, irresponsible spending, or self-indulgence, instead promoting the administration of said capital over the course of one's lifetime toward the cause of reducing the stratification between the rich and poor. As a result, the wealthy should administer their riches responsibly and not in a way that encourages \"the slothful, the drunken, the unworthy\".\n\n\"I should consider it a disgrace to die a rich man\" - Andrew Carnegie, 1887 \n\nAndrew Carnegie was born in Dunfermline, Scotland in 1835. The only schooling he received was from the local grammar school. He held onto his Scottish roots throughout most of his life - he retained close ties with his relative that stayed in Scotland; many of his early business associates were americanized Scots; his English school friends had Scottish ties; he returned home to Scotland almost every summer. Even his radicalism can be tied to his Scottish roots. His immediate family rejected the establishment, from his grandfather who was a controversial orator and contributor to \"Register\", William Cobbet's political journal, to his mother and father, who rejected the Presbyterian Church.\n\nDue to their radicalism, the Carnegies moved to Antebellum America in 1848. His father lost nearly everything he owned, and never recovered from the shock of his poverty, so Carnegie's mother supported the family until he, himself, was able to become the primary breadwinner, and support the family. He felt indebted to his mother for the rest of his life, which contributed to his determination to succeed, and his generosity with his money later in life. Carnegie didn't marry until after his mother died.\n\nUnlike many industrialists of his time, Carnegie was not an inventor or a risk-taking Wall Street financier. Many of his fellow capitalists financed their various business ventures with watered-down stocks. This is not how Carnegie chose to conduct his business. All of his early organizations were either partnerships or associations. He chose to focus on the vertical integration of a single industry, specifically the steel industry. Most others made their profits by creating a horizontal monopoly. He worked hard to control entire industries, rather than parts of many. By 1890, Carnegie was a multi-millionaire.\n\nAt the age of 35, Carnegie decided to limit his personal wealth and donate the surplus to benevolent causes. He was determined to be remembered for his good deeds rather than his wealth. He became a \"radical\" philanthropist. Prior to publishing his ideas about wealth, he began donating to his favorite causes, starting by donating a public bath to his hometown of Dunfermline.\n\nCarnegie never pursued a formal education. At one point, he wrote that he wished to attend Oxford University, but that never happened. Instead, he spent most of his free time as a young adult reading and educating himself.\n\nAndrew Carnegie died in 1919 in Lenox, Massachusetts. His autobiography was published posthumously in 1920, which contained many gaps, since he died in the midst of writing his book about the outbreak of the First World War.\n\nAs Carnegie tried to live his life in a way that the poor could benefit from his wealth, he decided he needed to share his ideas with the public. In 1880, he published his controversial views in an article entitled \"Wealth\" in the \"North American Review,\" an opinion magazine for America's establishment. It was later published as \"The Gospel of Wealth\" in the \"Pall Mall Gazette\".\n\nThe Gospel of Wealth asserts that hard work and perseverance lead to wealth.\n\nCarnegie based his philosophy on the observation that the heirs of large fortunes frequently squandered them in riotous living rather than nurturing and growing them. Even bequeathing one's fortune to charity was no guarantee that it would be used wisely, due to the fact that there was no guarantee that a charitable organization not under one's direction would use the money in accordance with one's wishes. Carnegie disapproved of charitable giving that maintained the poor in their impoverished state, and urged a movement toward the creation of a new mode of giving that would create opportunities for the beneficiaries of the gift to better themselves. As a result, the gift would not be simply consumed, but would be productive of even greater wealth throughout the house.\n\nIn \"The Gospel of Wealth\", Carnegie examines the modes of distributing accumulated wealth and capital to the communities from which they originate. He preached that ostentatious living and amassing private treasures were wrong. He praised the high British taxes on the estates of dead millionaires, remarking that \"By taxing estates heavily at death the State marks its condemnation of the selfish millionaire's unworthy life. It is desirable that nations should go much further in this direction.\"\n\nCarnegie made it clear that the duty of the rich was to live modest lifestyles, and that any surplus of money they had was best suited for re-circulation back into society where it could be used to support the greater good. He shunned aristocratic chains of inheritance and argued that dependents should be supported by their work with major moderation, with the bulk of excess wealth to be spent on enriching the community. In cases where excess wealth was held until death, he advocated its apprehension by the state on a progressive scale: \"Indeed, it is difficult to set bounds to the share of a rich man's estates which should go at his death to the public through the agency of the State, and by all means such taxes should be granted, beginning at nothing upon moderate sums to dependents, and increasing rapidly as the amounts swell, until of the millionaire's hoard, at least the other half comes to the privy coffer of the State.\" .\n\nWhen Carnegie Steel busted the union in 1892, Carnegie was able to keep himself from blame because he focused on his new doctrine for the wealthy. The Homestead Strike ended in a showdown between 300 Pinkerton guards and a crowd of steel workers and supporters devolved into an exchange of gunfire. This outbreak left 7 workers and 3 guards dead, and many more wounded. It made headlines around the world, and reporters reached Carnegie, who was in Scotland at the time. When questioned, Carnegie called the violence \"deplorable\" but otherwise pleaded ignorance, and stated \"I have given up all active control of the business.\" This move kept him innocent, and he began to focus on his philanthropic work and teaching the Gospel of Wealth. His good works still benefit people around the globe, and people saw that in him. The Homestead Strike did little to mar his reputation.\n\nCarnegie's controversial views on wealth sparked a trans-Atlantic debate that argued the nature, purpose, and disposition of wealth.\n\nWilliam Ewart Gladstone, the head of the Liberal Party in England, and a friend of Carnegie's, had some sharp remarks on the publication. Even though they were close friends and had similar political ideals, Gladstone did not agree with Carnegie's paper. Gladstone defended primogeniture, unlimited inheritance, and the British Aristocracy. This led to many other critics joining Gladstone in denouncing Carnegie's \"radical\" philanthropic ways.\n\nThese critical reviews led Carnegie to publish a series of essays defending himself. He defended individualism, private property, and the accumulation of personal wealth on the grounds that they benefited the human race in the long run. In an effort to convince his critics that he wasn't saying everyone should get free handouts from the upper class, he edited his original doctrine, so that it read \"Help those who will help themselves, to provide part of the means by which those who desire to improve may do so.\" Since many interpreted his writing to mean that all those in poverty should be assisted by the wealthy, it was necessary for Carnegie to clarify that charity has its limitations.\n\nIn 1901, U.S. Senator Jonathan Prentiss Dolliver wrote an article for the celebrity magazine \"Success\", titled \"Phoebe Apperson Hearst and the New Gospel of Wealth\". Hearst was an American philanthropist and suffragist. According to Dolliver, Hearst saw inadequacies of public schools and was concerned about urban poverty and vice. She, like Carnegie, believed that as a millionaire, it was her duty to help those less fortunate. The purpose of Dolliver's article was to explain Hearst's \"Gospel of Wealth\" and illustrate how she should be viewed as a complementary equal to men like Carnegie. She declared that women who were wealthy had a sacred and moral duty to give away their fortunes to causes, especially progressive education and reform, to benefit their communities. Like Carnegie, Hearst was very concerned with giving the lower class the opportunity to be educated at the same level at which the upper class was educated. Also like Carnegie, she established her own free public library. Hers was located in Anaconda, Montana.\n\nCarnegie put his philosophy into practice through a program of gifts to endow public libraries, known as 'Carnegie libraries' in cities and towns throughout the United States and the English-speaking world, with the idea that he was thus providing people with the tools to better themselves. In order to ensure that his gifts would not be wasted, he stipulated that the municipality must pass an ordinance establishing a tax to support the library's ongoing operating costs after the initial grant provided the costs for building and equipping the library. Each of these organizations had its own endowment and its own board of trustees. Many of them still exist today.\n\nAfter several communities squandered their grants on extravagant buildings, Carnegie established a system of architectural guidelines that mandated simplicity and functionality. When it became obvious that Carnegie could not give away his entire fortune within his lifetime, he established the Carnegie Foundation to continue his program of giving.\n\nLittle Free Libraries are starting to pop up in cities like Ann Arbor and Detroit, Michigan, and Cleveland, Ohio. These free libraries follow Carnegie's philosophy of offering to the lower class things that the upper class already has access to. Little Free Libraries is an organization that stocks books in boxes throughout inner-city areas for the youth to enjoy. For many reasons, these kids don't have access to regular libraries. Having instant access to books in their neighborhood is beneficial in helping them improve their literacy and progress with their education at the same pace as the children in the more affluent neighborhoods.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "3289716", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=3289716", "title": "Union of African States", "text": "Union of African States\n\nThe Union of African States (), sometimes called the Ghana–Guinea–Mali Union, was a short-lived and loose regional organization formed 1958 linking the West African nations of Ghana and Guinea as the Union of Independent African States. Mali joined in 1960. It disbanded in 1963.\n\nThe union planned to develop a common currency and unified foreign policy amongst members; however, none of these proposals were implemented by the countries. The union was the first organization in Africa to bring together former colonies of the British and the French. Although the union was open to all independent states in Africa, no other states joined. The union had a limited impact on politics as there was never any administration or permanent meetings to support the goals of unity. Its legacy was largely limited to longstanding political relationships between Kwame Nkrumah (President and Prime Minister of Ghana 1957–1966), Ahmed Sékou Touré (President of Guinea 1958–1984), and Modibo Keïta (President of Mali 1960–1968). The union again came into the news when Nkrumah was named as the co-president of Guinea after he was deposed as President of Ghana by a military coup in 1966.\n\nThe colonies of Guinea, the Gold Coast (which became Ghana), and French Sudan (which became Mali) followed different paths toward decolonization. French Sudan and Guinea were both French colonies and thus after the May 1958 crisis were given the chance to vote for immediate independence or to join a reorganized French Community (which would grant domestic autonomy while maintaining French defense and economic policy). Guinea was the only French colony in Africa to vote for full independence in 1958. French Sudan voted to join the French Community. The Gold Coast, in contrast, was a British colony which achieved independence as Ghana in March 1957 and joined the Commonwealth of Nations.\n\nThe differences continued into the post-independence era. The French government, with urging from the Ivory Coast, began a complete withdrawal of French personnel from Guinea and a suspension of aid when the country declared independence. This resulted in economic turmoil throughout the country and sent a warning against independence for the other colonies. French Sudan joined with Senegal to form the Mali Federation for a few months in 1960. However, political intractability led to the dissolution of the Mali Federation in August 1960. Ghana, in contrast, was presented as a success story of the decolonization period in Africa with a booming economy and the recognition from international organizations for its astute fiscal management.\n\nDespite these differences, the leaders of the three countries shared a common vision of Africa's future. Kwame Nkrumah, Ahmed Sékou Touré, and Modibo Keïta were each pivotal anti-colonial figures in their countries and the first leaders after independence. In addition, each became prominent in the Pan-African movement and were architects in developing a theory of African socialism.\n\nIn November 1958, with the sudden cessation of French aid and personnel for Guinea, Nkrumah and Touré met in Conakry, the capital of Guinea, to discuss an emergency loan which Ghana was going to provide to Guinea. On 23 November, the two leaders announced a plan for the creation of a union of African states which the two leaders would work towards over a series of meetings with the loan as the first of many steps towards integration. Following these negotiations, the Union of Independent African States (UIAS) was declared on 1 May 1959. The agreement was very loose, only requiring that the members work together on relations with other African countries and thus was, in the words of journalist Russel Warren Howe, more pragmatic than ambitious. They declared intentions for developing a shared currency (a union bank and union economic council were planned) and shared citizenship, but did not include unified defense or foreign policy provisions in regards to countries outside of Africa. Despite these declarations, little happened to cement any shared currency or create unified citizenship between the two countries in 1958 or 1959. The only significant effect of the union was the £10 million (about £ today) loan provided by Ghana to Guinea. However, even this relationship was hesitantly agreed to by the members. Guinea used less than half of the funds provided by Ghana despite its continued economic problems.\n\nIn November 1960, following the tense end of the Mali Federation in August, talks begun between the two original members with Mali to join an expanded union. These negotiations reached fruition on 1 July 1961 when the charter of the newly named Union of African States was published simultaneously in the capitals of the three members. The charter of the union provided for collective security (the agreement that an attack on any of the three countries would be an attack on all) and shared diplomatic, economic, educational, and cultural activities. The union remained loose but the leaders believed it would set the ground for a larger and stronger union between members. At the signing ceremony on 1 July, Nkrumah declared that the union would be \"a nucleus of a United States of Africa\". Diplomatically, the union became a key part of the Casablanca group and the three members agreed to push for similar policy issue within that forum. Similarly, the leaders approached Cold War politics in a similar manner, promoting a pro-Soviet involvement in the Non-Aligned Movement. Although Mali and Ghana had discussed creating a shared parliament, such a provision was not contained in the final agreement. Other issues, such as the creation of a single flag for all three countries, a unified economic policy, a unified foreign policy, and the development of a common constitution were mentioned but not provided with details and were to be worked out by regular meetings of the three leaders. No administration was ever established and the only regular governance of the union was set to be meetings between the three leaders of the members.\n\nThe union was confronted by a series of significant problems from its establishment. Ghana was separated from Guinea by the countries of the Ivory Coast and Sierra Leone and separated from Mali by the country of Upper Volta. Attempts to bridge this gap by including Upper Volta in the union failed, despite a number of overtures by Nkrumah. In one meeting between Maurice Yaméogo, the president of Upper Volta, and Nkrumah the two pledged to work together toward \"effective unity of Africa\" and together knocked down a wall constructed specifically for the ceremony. Similarly, although Mali and Guinea share a border, there had been little creation of significant transportation infrastructure between the countries (both of them being more significantly linked to Senegal during the colonial period). Another problem was that the countries had separate linguistic and colonial infrastructures which limited the space for any significant policy unification. In addition, although the parties agreed on many foreign policy goals, they were divided about United Nations Operation in the Congo in 1960 and 1961. Finally, although the agreement was open to all African states, suspicion about Nkrumah and regional politics between the three leaders and Félix Houphouët-Boigny in the Ivory Coast limited the union's expansion.\n\nThe economic council never got started and only a few meetings were held between the three leaders. Tensions increased between the members in 1963 with the 1963 Togolese coup d'état: Nkrumah was accused of having supported the coup. In the preparation for the Addis Ababa summit to found the Organization of African Unity, Touré was upset with Nkrumah for pursuing an agenda without consultation of the other members. The union was dissolved without much attention in May 1963.\n\nThe political alliance between the three leaders was the most significant legacy of the union. Ghana, Guinea, and Mali remained tightly connected until Nkrumah was removed from power by a military coup in 1966. As an example of this continuing relationship, the Ghanaian ambassador to Mali retained the title of \"Resident Minister\" even after the political union had dissolved.\n\nThe union again became important in 1966 when Nkrumah was removed as the President of Ghana by a military coup while he was in China dealing with peace talks about the Vietnam war. After the coup, he returned to Guinea where he was greeted ceremoniously by Touré and the latter declared that Nkrumah was now the head of state of Guinea and the Secretary General of the Democratic Party of Guinea. Touré declared that \"If there were a conference of African heads of state tomorrow, Comrade Nkrumah would speak in the name of Guinea, because Nkrumah is not a simple African but a universal man.\" The U.S. State Department was incredulous at the time about whether this naming of Nkrumah as president of the country was genuine and the declaration of Nkrumah as the co-president of Guinea with Touré is often considered to be an honorific title.\n\nBooks and Journal Articles\n\nNewspaper articles (organized chronologically)\n\nWebsites\n"}

Many of the victims of the White Terror were Jewish. During the White Terror, tens of thousands were imprisoned without trial and as many as 1,000 people were killed.\n\nAt the end of World War I, the political configuration of the Hungarian state was forced into swift and radical change. The Austro-Hungarian Empire, of which Hungary had been a powerful member, collapsed. The victorious Entente powers took steps to carve out Hungary’s ethnically mixed border regions and grant them to the Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes, Czechoslovakia, and Romania – efforts which resulted in Hungary’s losing two thirds of its land area, and one third of its Hungarian-speaking nationals. These losses together with the postwar socioeconomic upheaval catalysed deep feelings of humiliation and resentment among many Hungarians.\n\nIn this volatile atmosphere, the nation’s fledgling efforts to form a single stable government failed. In March 1919, a government of communists, taking over from a Social Democrat-Communist coalition, established the Hungarian Soviet Republic. The Communist Party of Hungary, led by Béla Kun, had the most influence in the republic, although the government was ostensibly led by the Social Democratic-Communist coalition. Kun’s government lasted less than four months, eventually ending upon the Romanian invasion. During this period, heightened political tension and suppression led to arrests and executions in what came to be known as the Red Terror. This led to a lowering in support of the government. Hungary attempted to retain Slovakia and Transylvania, but Romanian troops invaded Hungary, eventually reaching Budapest in August 1919. Upon the invasion, most Hungarian communists, including Kun, went in exile.\n\nIn the south of the country, an alternative government formed to replace the Hungarian Soviet Republic. Leading the armed wing of this new government, the \"National Army\", was Miklós Horthy, one-time Admiral of the Austro-Hungarian Navy.\n\nAmong the officers who answered Horthy’s call were ultra-nationalist soldiers who mounted a campaign of atrocities in a retaliation to the Red Terror; to eliminate communist supporters and frighten the population into obedience to the new order.\n\nThe pogroms and mass murders were carried out by units of the \"National Army\" commanded by Mihály Horthy; paramilitary organisations also committed killings, especially the \"Hungarian Awakening\".\n\nThese units, commonly known as the \"White Guard,\" carried out a campaign of murder, torture and humiliations. Summary executions of people they suspected of communist allegiance were common; these victims were often hanged in public places to serve as a warning to others. But the White Guard’s definition of who was an enemy of the state was a broad one. They also preyed upon peasants, upon the politically liberal, and very often upon Jews, who were broadly blamed for the revolution because much of the communist leadership had been Jewish.\n\nThe most notorious of unit commanders was Pál Prónay, whose battalion engaged in sadistic violence against its enemies. Others included Gyula Ostenberg, Anton Lehár, and Ivan Hejjas, who focused his efforts on the Hungarian plain around the town of Kecskémet. Their detachments were part of the National Army, but tended to function as personal battalions following a fanatical loyalty to their commanders. Their atrocities included torture, rape, summary execution, and desecration of the corpses for public display.\n\nHardest hit were the regions of Transdanubia, the wider area of Horthy's headquarters in Siófok, and in the lowlands between the Danube and the Theiss rivers, where mass murders which aroused international attention were committed in Kecskémet and Orgovány.\n\nThe National Army invaded Budapest in November 1919, and four months later Horthy became Regent of the newly established Kingdom of Hungary. But, far from discontinuing their campaigns, the reactionary units expanded and continued terrorising their targets for almost two more years; politically motivated violence devolved into grudge-murders and kidnappings for profit. White Guard officers began to vie for power among themselves, and plotted for one another’s assassinations. Horthy’s biographer, Thomas L. Sakmyster, concluded that Horthy looked the other way in 1919 while the White Guard officers raged through the countryside.\n\nBy 1920 the terror receded noticeably. In 1921, Pál Prónay was prosecuted for crimes related to the White Terror. After Prónay joined a failed attempt to restore the Habsburg king, Charles I of Austria to Hungary’s throne, his battalion was disbanded.\n\nDespite the disbandment of the Prónay battalion, in subsequent years sporadic attacks occurred.\n\n"}
{"id": "19901388", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=19901388", "title": "Yassin Kadi", "text": "Yassin Kadi\n\nYassin Abdullah Kadi (also transliterated from Arabic as Yasin Abdullah Ezzedine al-Qadi or Yasin A. Kahdi) (b. 23 February 1955) is a Saudi Arabian businessman who has been described by friends and associates as a philanthropist. A multi-millionaire from Jeddah, Kadi trained as an architect in Chicago, Illinois. He is the son-in-law of Sheikh Ahmed Salah Jamjoom, a former Saudi Arabian government minister with close ties to the Saudi royal family.\n\nThe UN placed sanctions against Kadi in 1999 and 2000, when he was named by United Nations Security Council Resolutions 1267 and 1333 as a suspected associate of Osama bin Laden's terror network, al-Qaeda. On 12 October 2001, the U.S. Department of Treasury's Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) ordered his assets in the United States to be frozen. The European Union also applied sanctions to Kadi. In response, Kadi's lawyers brought two lawsuits now considered landmarks in public international law, known as \"Kadi I\" (2008) and \"Kadi II\" (2010). The case for which he is best known, a 2008 decision by the European Court of Justice, \"Kadi I\", is thought to have challenged \"the core framework of UN terrorist sanctions and forces UN member states to tackle difficult legal questions or else face possible collapse of the UN’s terrorist sanctions regime.\"\n\nKadi's listing as a terrorist was overturned by several European courts, and his name was removed from blacklists by Switzerland (2007), the European Union (2008 and 2010), and the United Kingdom (2008 and 2010). In September 2010, Kadi \"succeeded in having dismissed in their entirety the civil claims brought against him in the United States on behalf of the families of the 9/11 victims\", when a U.S. District Judge ruled that the District Court for the Southern District of New York had no jurisdiction over Kadi, a Saudi Arabian citizen. In October 2012, the UN Security Council committee monitoring sanctions against al-Qaeda granted Kadi's petition to be removed from its blacklist. The \"Kadi II\" decision by the European Court of Justice in July 2013 declined appeals by the EU and the UK against the earlier annulment of European sanctions against Kadi, saying that there was no evidence to substantiate the allegations of his being linked to terrorism. On 26 November 2014, the United States Department of the Treasury removed Kadi's name from its Specially Designated Nationals list.\n\nKadi was born 23 February 1955 in Cairo, Egypt. His father became a successful businessman in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia. He has six sisters and no brothers.\n\nAround 1977, Kadi earned a bachelor's degree in architectural engineering from Alexandria University in Cairo, Egypt, and subsequently became an intern at the architectural firm Skidmore, Owings & Merrill in Chicago from July 1979 to February 1981. He helped the firm develop a master plan and contract documentation for the Mecca Campus of the King Abdulaziz University.\n\nYassin Kadi married a daughter of Sheikh Ahmed Salah Jamjoom sometime before 1981. He and his wife have seven children, including a son who is a U.S. citizen.\n\nIn the 1980s, Kadi became a vice president of the Jamjoom Group, a multi-national conglomerate headquartered in Jeddah. Around 1986, Yassin Kadi became one of the principal investors in BMI Inc., a Shariah-compliant investment bank based in New Jersey.\n\nKadi inherited \"several million dollars\" in 1988. In 1990, he began to establish close business associations with Saudi billionaire Khalid bin Mahfouz, whose family owned a majority interest in Saudi Arabia's largest bank, the National Commercial Bank. Kadi said that he was brought in to maintain good financial relations with pious Muslims throughout the Islamic world, by building a more shariah-compliant banking network for the bank. \"We devised systems of leasing and ways to borrow money\" that could be used by pious Muslims, who are not allowed to charge interest, Kadi told the \"Chicago Tribune\".\n\nIn May 1992, Kadi created the Muwafaq Foundation, an Islamic charity incorporated for the stated purpose of providing famine relief and education in the Islamic world, particularly Pakistan. The charity was incorporated as a trust on the island of Jersey, an off-shore tax haven located near the coast of Normandy, France. Officials on the island told the Guardian that Jersey \"does not appear to maintain any public record of the Muwafaq Foundation.\" They said \"if it was structured as a financial trust, it would not require to be registered at all.\" Kadi personally donated about $15 to $20 million from his fortune, and solicited donations from bin Mahfouz and other wealthy Saudi families. Bin Mahfouz became a principal donor but later said that he was not involved in the operation of the charity after its establishment.\n\nA similarly named organization, the \"Muwaffaq Society\" or \"Muwaffaq Ltd.,\" was registered in the Isle of Man in June 1991, but Kadi denied any relationship to this entity. Plaintiffs who have filed suit against Kadi and his associates claim that Muwafaq was a charitable front used to funnel money to al-Qaeda, an allegation Mr Kadi has repeatedly denied.\n\nIn 1996, Kadi became one of the original founders and financial supporters of the Dar Al-Hekma Private College for Girls, a \"path-breaking Saudi women's college\" based in Jeddah. At the time of the September 11 attacks, he was serving as the Secretary-General of the college.\n\nAccording to Victor D. Comras, \"Al Kadi is believed to have acted swiftly after 9/11 to restructure many of his business interests and, while retaining actual control, placed many of his own assets into the hands of nominal managers and directors.\" In 2005, the New York Times estimated that Kadi’s net worth \"exceeds $65 million.\" In 2010, Comras described him as a billionaire, citing his extensive international business holdings.\n\nIn an October 2001 interview with the Chicago Tribune, Kadi said that he met with Osama bin Laden at religious gatherings in the 1980s, but \"he said the encounters were unremarkable at a time when bin Laden's battle against the Soviets in Afghanistan attracted US government support and donations from Mosques around the United States.\"\n\nIn a December 2008 interview with the New York Times, Kadi added that he once met Osama bin Laden in Chicago. He gives the date as 1981. Steven Coll, a biographer of the Bin Laden family discovered that the date of the visit was 1979. Osama \"was here for two weeks in 1979, it seems, and he visited Los Angeles and Indiana, among other places.\"\n\nThe date coincides with Kadi's arrival in Chicago in July 1979. Coll gives as his source a 2009 biography written by Osama's first wife, Najwa Bin Laden.\n\nIn 1991, Kadi loaned $820,000 to the Quranic Literacy Institute (QLI) of Oak Lawn, IL, a group formed to disseminate the Koran and Muslim texts but later allegedly linked to Hamas. Kadi told the Chicago Tribune he made the loan because of his friendship with the literacy institute's president, whom he met at a Sunday lecture in the Chicago area.\n\nKadi said the money was intended to allow the institute to make a land investment, which would yield profits that would support its charitable work.\n\nIn 1998, Kadi donated money toward the construction of housing for students at Al-Iman University in Sanaa, Yemen. The university’s name is also translated as Iman University or Al-Eman.\n\nA 2010 New York Times profile of the university indicates it is run by Muslims who follow Salafist practice, that is, a strict and puritanical form of Islam practiced by the Salafi (\"ancestors\" or first Muslims ). Al-Iman is \"not a typical college,\" says Glenn R. Simpson of the Wall Street Journal. \"Its curriculum primarily concerns the study and propagation of radical Islam.\"\n\nAccording to Glenn R. Simpson of the Wall Street Journal, Kadi's bank records show that, between January and August 1998, he transferred $1.25 million from his Geneva bank account through an associate to an alleged al-Qaeda front company in Turkey known as Maram. Founded as a travel agency and import-export business, the company Maram was reportedly established by Mamdouh Mahmud Salim, said to be one of al-Qaeda’s founding members and to have a history of moving money and shopping for weapons for the organization.\n\nA few months later, in December 1998, Kadi reportedly transferred shares in the company to two other men. One was Wael Hamza Julaidan, a Saudi businessman said to be a founder of al-Qaeda (the US officially designated Julaidan a financial supporter of al-Qaeda in 2002). The other was reported to be Mohammed Bayazid, another alleged founder of al-Qaeda.\n\nOn 20 December 1998 Salim was extradited to the United States, where he was charged with participating in the 1998 United States embassy bombings. In 2010, USA Today reported that he is an inmate of the ADX Florence facility in Florence, Colorado (reg.nr. 42426-054), sentenced to life without parole for stabbing a federal prison guard in the eye.\n\nOn 12 October 2001 Kadi was listed as one of several dozen individuals that the United States \"determined to have committed or to pose a significant risk of committing or providing material support for acts of terrorism\" under Executive Order 13224. His U.S. assets were frozen. On 15 October, OFAC sent a letter to Kadi notifying him of his rights to request reconsideration. Kadi was added to the UN list shortly afterward, which also resulted in his assets being frozen in European Union countries. Saudi Arabia \"supported the addition of the Jeddah-based terrorist financier, Yasin al-Qadi, to the UN's consolidated list in October 2001,\" according to an official press release of the U.S. Treasury.\n\nYassin Kadi was never formally charged with a crime by the U.S. Department of Treasury's Office of Foreign Assets Control. \"As is customary in such cases, Washington has presented no direct evidence linking Mr. Kadi to terrorism,\" the New York Times reported in 2008. \"But it has made public a dense labyrinth of associations and business and personal ties that it says establishes Mr. Kadi’s relationship with Mr. bin Laden and his allies.\"\n\n\"We have not found Mr. Kadi guilty of anything,\" Adam J. Szubin, director of OFAC, told the Times. \"But we have found that he is a supporter of terror.\"\n\n\"The post-911 credo became one of pre-emption and acting on suspicion,\" says Marieke DeGoede in her 2012 book \"Speculative Security: The Politics of Pursuing Terrorist Monies\". OFAC uses its new powers to freeze assets \"during the pendancy of an investigation,\" which means, effectively, that the government is able to stop the operations of charities suspected of being terrorist fronts \"without any formal determination of wrongdoing.\"\n\nKadi, who has repeatedly claimed that he has given no support to terrorism, told the Times that the result was a legal paradox. When no criminal charge has been brought and the evidence on which the charges are based has been classified, \"there is no way to defend yourself.\"\n\nKadi denied all the allegations as totally untrue. \"I don’t have any connection, be it close or distant, with Al-Qaeda or its leader Bin Laden, either directly or indirectly,\" he told Asharq Al-Awsat, a sister publication of Arab News, in an interview.\n\nIn December 2001, Kadi filed a challenge to the EU listing and asset freeze in the European Court of First Instance (General Court). His appeal was based on a claim that he had been denied fundamental due process. The same month, he also petitioned the U.S. Department of Treasury (OFAC) for reconsideration of his listing and asset freeze.\n\nAfter 11 September 2001, Yassin Kadi moved many of his operations to Istanbul, Turkey and Switzerland. \"Forbes\" reported that Kadi is a friend of Turkish Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan. Erdogan is quoted as having said \"I know Mr. Kadi. I believe in him as I believe in myself. For Mr. Kadi to associate with a terrorist organization, or support one, is impossible.\"\n\nOn 15 August 2002, firefighters, rescue workers and more than 600 relatives of victims of the September 11 attacks filed a $116 trillion lawsuit against Osama bin Laden, the Saudi Bin Laden Group, three Saudi princes, the government of Sudan, seven international banks, eight Islamic foundations, charities and subsidiaries, and many other defendants. Kadi was added to the list of defendants on 22 November 2002, along with 50 more people and organizations, bringing the total number of defendants to 186. The amount of money sought was reduced to $1 trillion, but the number of plaintiffs soon increased to 2,500 after the suit was widely publicized. Technically, Kadi was part of the \"Third Amended Complaint\" in the case of \"Thomas E. Burnett, Sr., et al. v. Al Baraka Investment and Development Corporation, et al.\", originally filed in the District of Columbia.\n\nInformally, the case is called the \"911 Lawsuit,\" and it is a landmark case that has been examined in great detail by legal scholars. In 2005 the case was combined with several other lawsuits to become \"In re Terrorist Attacks on September 11, 2001, MDL 1570,\" filed in the Southern District of New York. The case grew to more than 6,500 plaintiffs, collectively called \"9/11 Families United to Bankrupt Terrorism.\"\n\nOn 12 March 2004, OFAC issued a 20-page unclassified memorandum denying Kadi’s request for reconsideration. It determined that Kadi played \"a significant leadership role\" in the Muwafaq (\"Blessed Success\") Foundation, as one of six trustees, and the others \"delegated . . . the running and the operation of the Foundation\" to Kadi, who \"was the driving force behind the administration of the foundation.\" He \"effectively conceded that he directly supervised the individual country offices.\" OFAC relied on Kadi's involvement in Muwafaq and, in particular, activities claimed to have occurred in Bosnia, Albania, Sudan and Pakistan, to conclude that \"Kadi financially supported terrorist activities, primarily through Muwafaq, but also through other Kadi-owned entities.\" It considered Kadi's \"relationship with and financial transfers to, designated terrorists Abdul Latif Saleh, Wa'el Julaidan, and Chariq Ayadi -- who were all involved in Muwafaq.\"\n\nAccording to OFAC's findings, \"Muwafaq gave logistical and financial support to Al-Gama'at Al-Islamiya, a mujahadin battalion in Bosnia that was designated as SGDT on October 31, 2001. The organization also transferred $500,000 to terrorist organizations in the Balkans in the mid-1990s.\" OFAC found that Muwafaq \"was involved in arms trafficking from Albania to Bosnia,\" and concluded that \"as of late 2001, Kadi had continued to finance institutions and organizations in the Balkans after Muwafaq had ceased operations there, including two entities that were designated as SDGTs in early 2002 -- the Revival of Islamic Heritage Society's Pakistan and Afghanistan offices, and the Bosnia-Herzegovina branch of the Al-Haramain Foundation.\"\n\nOn 21 September 2004, the Swiss Federal Criminal Court ruled in Kadi's favor with regard to complaints brought by Kadi's lawyers against the Swiss prosecutor, Deputy Swiss Attorney General Claude Nicati. The Swiss court ordered that Kadi's lawyers be given full access to Nicati's entire file, including all notes taken by Nicati of his meeting with Jean-Charles Brisard.\n\n\"Brisard is the lead investigator for the US lawyers in the civil action brought in the US courts on behalf of the families of the victims of the Sept. 11, 2001 attacks and cannot therefore be regarded as independent,\" his lawyers said. \"Of particular concern to Al-Qadi was his discovery that Brisard passed to US lawyers documents he received from Nicati’s file in his capacity as expert.\"\n\nOn 27 March 2006, an extraordinary prosecutor appointed to investigate the matter concluded that Kadi's allegations were baseless and dismissed the action, finding that there was no evidence that Brisard or his assistants had improperly passed on information to Nicati.\n\nIn September 2005, the EU Court of First Instance (General Court) denied Kadi’s appeal, saying that compliance with EU law need not be considered because the UN Security Council has primacy. Kadi appealed to the EU Court of Justice.\n\nThe Federal Criminal Court in Berne, Switzerland, \"cleared Al-Qadi of any wrongdoing in a case stemming from the 9/11 attacks,\" his lawyers announced on 12 December 2005. The charges had alleged that Kadi gave money in 1998 ostensibly to construct student housing at Al-Iman University in Yemen while knowing that the funds may have ended up supporting Al-Qaeda’s plan to attack New York City.\n\n\"I am very happy to know that my friend Al-Qadi has been cleared of all charges by the Swiss court,\" Zuhair Fayez, a Jeddah-based architect, told Arab News on 25 December. He described Kadi as a reputable businessman and said the individuals and agencies that falsely accused Kadi of funding terrorism must be held responsible for damaging his reputation and interests.\n\nOn 13 December 2007, based on the results of its own six-year investigation, a Swiss court removed Kadi from the country's list of blocked terrorists. Arab News reported that Kadi was exonerated \"on all charges\" and said that his money in Swiss banks and the Geneva-based Faisal bank would be unfrozen. Switzerland is not a member of the European Union and therefore had no obligation to comply with the EU listing.\n\nIn 2008 the European Court of Justice overturned sanctions against Kadi by individual European Union governments, on the grounds the EU nations had not offered those sanctioned a chance for the judicial review of their matter.\n\nOn 3 September 2008, the EU Court of Justice (higher court) ruled in favor of Kadi, \"saying UN agreements cannot have the effect of prejudicing constitutional principles agreed to in the treaty establishing the European Community. The court found the EU regulation allowing listing and asset freezes to breach fundamental human rights, since no evidence was communicated to Kadi, and the right of defence and effective judicial review were prejudiced. It gave EU authorities three months to remedy these defects, leaving the sanctions in place during that time.\"\n\nAccording to \"Forbes\" magazine, none of the bodies that have sanctioned Kadi have made public any of the evidence upon which the sanctions were and continued to be based.\n\nOn 22 October 2008, Martin Scheinin, in a report to the United Nations Security Council, suggested greater openness and transparency for making known the reasons individuals and organizations were being sanctioned.\nHe stated:\n\nIn October 2008, the EU Commission (sanctions agency) provided to Kadi’s attorneys a brief summary of the UN’s reasons for listing Kadi, and they gave Kadi an opportunity for comment. On 28 November 2008, the EU Commission renewed its listing and assets freeze against Kadi.\n\nIn December 2008, the UK Treasury removed Yassin Kadi from its list of persons designated as terrorists under its Terrorism (United Nations Measures) Order 2001 (the \"2001 Order\"), but left him on a second list of persons designated as terrorists under separate UK legislation, the Al Qaeda and Taliban (United Nations Measures) Order 2006 (the \"2006 Order\"), which contained different listing criteria.\n\nAccording to his UK lawyers at Carter-Ruck, \"this delisting followed a comprehensive review by the UK Treasury of the case against Mr. Kadi, including a review of the materials which had been used to support Mr. Kadi's original designation, after which the UK Treasury concluded that \"the case against (Mr. Kadi) no longer meets the test set out in ... the Terrorism Order.\"\n\nOn 16 January 2009, Kadi filed suit against officers of the U.S. Department of Treasury (OFAC) in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia (\"Yassin Abdullah Kadi v. Timothy Geithner et al.\", Civil Action No. 09-0108; and \"Kadi v. Paulson et al.\", a request for agency decision review assigned to Judge John D. Bates, Case 28-1331).\n\nThe lawsuit and request for agency review challenged Kadi’s designation as a terrorist and the asset freeze. Kadi raised \"constitutional claims regarding due process, free speech, and protection from unreasonable seizure of assets.\"\n\nIn February 2009, Kadi filed a new lawsuit with the EU General Court (formerly the Court of First Instance), challenging the EU’s 28 November 2008 decision to renew his listing and assets freeze.\n\nOn 13 August 2009, the United Nations Security Council Committee concerning Al-Qaida and associated individuals and entities (the \"Al-Qaida Sanctions Committee\") posted additional information and a narrative summary of their reasons for listing Yasin Abdullah Ezzeddine Kadi. The reasons included:\n\nBased on these reasons, the U.N. Security Council resolved to continue listing Yassin Kadi as a suspected supporter of al-Qaeda terrorists and the United States Department of Treasury has continued to classify Kadi as a Specially Designated Global Terrorist.\n\nOn 27 January 2010, the Supreme Court of the United Kingdom (the highest appellate court for the UK) annulled the listing criteria of \"the 2006 Order,\" the Al Qaeda and Taliban (United Nations Measures) Order 2006. In the case of \"Her Majesty's Treasury v Ahmed\" the court struck down the operative part of the legislation, and ruled that it must be quashed as being \"ultra vires\", or beyond the powers of the government which were conferred under the UK's United Nations Act 1946, which allowed the UK to implement UN Security Council Resolutions.\n\nThus Kadi's removal from a second UK list of persons designated as terrorists \"was done as the result of the finding of the Supreme Court of the United Kingdom that any such designation (as was done in Mr. Kadi's case in contravention of his fundamental rights) was illegal.\"\n\nOn 30 September 2010, the EU General Court once again ruled in favor of Kadi, \"noting that the UN procedure, despite improvements in the establishment of an Ombudsman Office to make recommendations on delisting requests, lacks fundamental due process protections, including sufficient notice of the charges and denying ‘most minimal access to the evidence against him.’\" It said: \"In essence the Security Council has still not deemed it appropriate to establish an independent and impartial body responsible for hearing ... decisions taken by the Sanctions Committee.\" (Paragraph 128).\n\nAccording to Kadi's solicitors at Carter-Ruck, the ruling had the effect of striking down the European asset-freezing regulation that was imposed on Kadi on 28 November 2008 after he had won his appeal to the European Court of Justice.\n\nKadi was among nine defendants sued by the Lloyd's of London insurance syndicate on 8 September 2011 in a \"landmark legal case against Saudi Arabia, accusing the kingdom of indirectly funding al-Qa'ida and demanding the repayment of £136m [$215 million] it paid out to victims of the 9/11 attacks.\" Formally titled \"Underwriting Members of Lloyd's Syndicate 3500 v. Kingdom of Saudi Arabia et al.\", the civil suit was filed in Pittsburgh (the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Pennsylvania).\n\n\"Absent the sponsorship of al Qaeda’s material sponsors and supporters, including the defendants named herein, al Qaeda would not have possessed the capacity to conceive, plan and execute the September 11th attacks,\" according to the 154-page complaint.\n\nYassin Kadi is listed along with the following defendants:\n\nOn 19 March 2012, the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia dismissed Kadi’s 2009 lawsuit against the officers of the U.S. Department of Treasury (OFAC). Judge John D. Bates brushed off Kadi's claim that OFAC \"simply ignored\" his explanation that Muwafaq was an organization engaged in charitable activities. Kadi had said the government believes Muwafaq is a front for bin Laden because USA Today reported that. \"To the extent Kadi contends that newspaper articles cannot be relied upon by the government at all, that proposition is not well-grounded,\" Bates wrote. \"As already stated, reliance on hearsay is plainly allowed. Furthermore, reliance on newspaper articles has been permitted to 'fill in evidentiary gaps when there is corroboration,' as well as to provide background information\", Bates explained in his judgement.\n\nBates stated \"the Court finds that this claim must be dismissed because (1) the bill of attainder clause does not apply to acts taken by a regulatory agency and (2) even if it did, the clause is not triggered here, because there was no action constituting 'punishment'\".\n\nThe U.N. Security Council created an independent ombudsman in 2009 to handle requests to get off the blacklist. The decision to delist Kadi came following his request for removal, according to a UN statement.\n\nIt stated that \"after concluding its consideration of the delisting request submitted by this individual through the Ombudsperson established pursuant to Security Council resolution 1904 (2009), and after considering the Comprehensive Report of the Ombudsperson on this delisting request. Therefore, the assets freeze, travel ban and arms embargo set out in paragraph 1 of Security Council resolution 1989 (2011) no longer apply to the following individual.\"\n\nThe European Commission, the European Council, and the United Kingdom appealed against the 2010 ruling of the EU General Court which had struck down the freezing of Kadi's European assets. The Grand Chamber of the Court of Justice of the European Union declined the appeal. According to Maya Lester, the decision hinged upon the court having gone through \"each reason for the decision to re-list Yassin Kadi in 2008, and Mr Kadi’s evidence in response, and found none of the reasons to have been substantiated with evidence\". The court stated that \"since no information or evidence has been produced to substantiate the allegations, roundly refuted by Mr. Al-Qadi, of his being involved in activities linked to international terrorism, those allegations are not such as to justify the adoption, at European Union level, of restrictive measures against him.\"\n\nOn September 11, 2014, OFAC unblocked the property and interests in property of Yassin Kadi pursuant to E.O. 13224, \"Blocking Property and Prohibiting Transactions With Persons Who Commit, Threaten To Commit, or Support Terrorism.\"\n\nCited in Footnotes\n\n\nAdditional References\n\n(Potomac Books Inc., 2010) p. 98\n(University of Minnesota Press, 2012) p. 133 ff.\nUniversity Press, 2007), p. 168\n\n"}
