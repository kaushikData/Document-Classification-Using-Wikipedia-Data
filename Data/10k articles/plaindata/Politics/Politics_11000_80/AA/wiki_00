The majority of those killed were supporters of the People's Mujahedin of Iran, although supporters of other leftist factions, including the Fedaian and the Tudeh Party of Iran (Communist Party), were executed as well.\n\nThe killings have been described as a political purge without precedent in modern Iranian history, both in terms of scope and coverup. However, the exact number of prisoners executed remains a point of contention. Amnesty International recorded the names of over 4,482 disappeared prisoners during this time, and then-Supreme Leader Ruhollah Khomeini's deputy, Hussein-Ali Montazeri put the number between 2,800 and 3,800 in his memoirs, but an alternative estimation suggests that the number exceeded 30,000.\n\nGreat care was taken to keep the killings undercover, and the government of Iran currently denies their having taken place. Justifications offered for the alleged executions vary, but one of the most common theories advanced is that they were in retaliation for the 1988 attack on the western borders of Iran by the People's Mujahedin of Iran. However, this does not fully account for the targeting of other leftist groups who opposed the Mujahedin invasion.\n\nSurvivors of the massacre have made various calls for justice and prosecution for the event. Canada has called the event a crime against humanity, and Italy has made similar declarations for justice to be served.\n\nShortly before the executions commenced, Iranian leader Ruhollah Khomeini issued \"a secret but extraordinary order – some suspect a formal fatwa.\" This set up \"Special Commissions with instructions to execute members of People's Mojahedin Organization of Iran as \"moharebs\" (those who war against Allah) and leftists as \"mortads\" (apostates from Islam).\"\n\nIn part the letter reads:\n\nTranslation :\n\n[\"In the Name of God,\n\"The Compassionate, the Merciful,\"]\n\n\"As the treacherous Monafeqin [Mojahedin] do not believe in Islam and what they say is out of deception and hypocrisy, and \n\"As their leaders have confessed that they have become renegades, and \n\"As they are waging war on God, and \n\"As they are engaging in classical warfare in the western, the northern and the southern fronts, and \n\"As they are collaborating with the Baathist Party of Iraq and spying for Saddam against our Muslim nation, and \n\"As they are tied to the World Arrogance, and in light of their cowardly blows to the Islamic Republic since its inception,\n\"It is decreed that those who are in prison throughout the country and remain steadfast in their support for the Monafeqin [Mojahedin] are waging war on God and are condemned to execution.\"\n\nIn Tehran the special commission for the executions had 16 members representing the various authorities of the Islamic government – Imam Khomeini himself, the president, the chief prosecutor, the Revolutionary Tribunals, the Ministries of Justice and Intelligence, and the administration of Evin and Gohar Dasht, the two prisons in the Tehran area from which the prisoner were eliminated. The chair of the commission was Ayatollah Morteza Eshraqi. His two special assistants were Hojatt al-Islam Hossein-Ali Nayyeri and Hojjat al-Islam Ali Mobasheri. The commission shuttled back and forth between Evin and Gohar Dasht prisons by helicopter. In the provinces similar commissions were established, but less is known about them.\n\nAnother description of the administration of the executions has it implemented by a \"four-man commission, later known as the 'death committee'.\" Members were Hossein-Ali Nayyeri (who was then a judge), Morteza Eshraqi (then Tehran Prosecutor), Ebrahim Raisi (then Deputy Prosecutor General) and Mostafa Pourmohammadi (then the representative of the Intelligence Ministry in Evin Prison). Ebrahim Raisi, went on to campaign for president of Iran in 2017 as a hard-line conservative where he was criticized for his role in the executions.\n\nThe prisoners were not executed without any proceedings, but were \"tried\" on charges totally unrelated to the charges that had landed them in prison. They were interviewed by commissions with a set list of questions to see if they qualified as \"moharebs\" or \"mortads\" to the satisfaction of that commission. Many, if not most, of the prisoners were unaware of the true purpose of the questions, although later some were warned by the prison grapevine.\n\nSome of the victims were killed because of their beliefs about religion – because they were atheists or because they were Muslims who followed different versions of Islam.\n\nSome scholarly examinations of the massacre argue that the planning stages of the 1988 Massacre began months before the actual executions started. According to one report: \"prison officials took the unusual step in late 1987 and early 1988 of re-questioning and separating all political prisoners according to party affiliation and length of sentence.\" The actual execution process began in the early hours of 19 July 1988 with the isolation of the political prisoners from the outside world. Prison gates were closed, scheduled visits and telephone calls were canceled, letters, care packages, and even vital medicines from the outside were turned away, the main law courts went on an unscheduled vacation. Even relatives of prisoners were forbidden to congregate outside the prison gates.\n\nInside the prison, cell blocks were isolated from each other and cleared of radios and televisions. Places where prisoners gathered communally, such as lecture halls, workshops, infirmaries, were all closed down and inmates were confined to their cells. Prison guards and workers were ordered not to speak to prisoners. One prisoner constructed a homemade wireless set to listen to the radio news from the outside but found news broadcasters were saying nothing at all about the lockdown.\n\nThe first prisoners to be interviewed or \"tried\" were the male members of the \"People's Mujahedin of Iran\", including those who had repented of their association with the group. The commission prefaced the proceedings with the false assurance that this was not a trial but a process for initiating a general amnesty and separating the Muslims from the non-Muslims.\n\nIt first asked their organisational affiliation; if they replied \"Mojahedin\", the questioning ended there. If they replied \"monafeqin\" (hypocrites), the commission continued with such questions as:\n\n\nNot surprisingly, almost all the prisoners failed to answer in the affirmative to all the questions. These were then taken to another room and ordered to write their last will and testament and to discard any personal belongings such as rings, watches, and spectacles. They were then blindfolded and taken to the gallows where they were hanged in batches of six. Since \"hanging\" did not mean death by breaking of the neck by drop through a trap door, but stringing up the victim by the neck to suffocate, some took fifteen minutes to die.\n\nAfter the first few days, the overworked executioners requested firing squads. These requests were rejected on the claim that the Shari'a mandated hanging for apostates and enemies of Allah, though it is thought that the real reason may have been that hanging was quieter than gunfire and would thus better preserve the secrecy of the operations.\n\nAt first this secrecy was effective. \"One survivor admits that he thought he was being processed to be released in time for the forthcoming peace celebrations.\"\n\nAfter 27 August, the commission turned its attention to the leftist prisoners, such as members of the Tudeh, Majority Fedayi, Minority Fedayi, other Fedayi, Kumaleh, Rah-e Kargar, Peykar. These were also assured they were in no danger and asked: \n\n\nPrisoners were told that authorities were asking them these questions because they planned to separate practicing Muslims from non-practicing ones. However, the real reason was to determine whether the prisoners qualified as apostates from Islam, in which case they would join the \"moharebs\" in the gallows.\n\nSome prisoners saved from execution by answering the questions properly returned to their cells and passed along what the commission was asking. A leftist prisoner \"who had at one time attended a seminary quickly grasped the theological significance of the questions\" and \"spent the night of August 30 sending morse code messages to other cells\" by knocking on the prison walls. He pointed \"out the hidden dangers.\" The questioners wanted to know if prisoners' fathers prayed, fasted, and read the Qur'an because the sons of devout men could be called apostates. If they had not been raised in proper Muslim homes first and \"exposed to true Islam,\" they could not be apostates. Another wrong answer was refusing to reply \"on the grounds of 'privacy',\" which \"could itself be taken as an admission of 'apostasy'.\"\n\nAll this was a surprise to the prisoners, with one commenting: \"In previous years, they wanted us to confess to spying. In 1988, they wanted us to convert to Islam.\" It also meant there was no correlation between the length of sentence being served and the likelihood of death. \"The first leftist to go before the Evin commission were those with light, and even completed, sentences.\" These had no warning of what was in store and many died.\n\nMojahedin women were given equal treatment with Mojahedin men, almost all hanged as 'armed enemies of Allah' However, for apostasy the punishment for women was different and lighter than that for men. Since according to the commission's interpretation of Islamic law, women were not fully responsible for their actions, \"disobedient women – including apostates – could be given discretionary punishments to mend their ways and obey male superiors.\"\n\nLeftist women—even those raised as practicing Muslims—were given another 'opportunity' to recant their 'apostasy.' \"After the investigation, leftist women were all given five lashes for every one of the five daily prayers missed, half the punishment meted out to the men. After a while, many agreed to pray, but some went on hunger strike, refusing even water. One died after 22 days and 550 lashes, and the authorities certified her death as suicide because it was 'she who had made the decision not to pray.'\"\n\nAccording to Iranian human rights lawyer Shirin Ebadi, executed prisoner's families were told: 'For one year you shall refrain from holding a funeral, or mourning his death in any public way. If after one year your conduct is deemed acceptable, we will reveal to you his place of burial.' The justification given to these families for the execution of their loved ones was that the prisoner's name had appeared on notes pinned to PMOI members killed in the Mersad attack whose bodies had been recovered by Iranian Islamic officials. The notes listing the PMOI's supporters' in prison so the prisoners had been guilty of aiding the attack. Ebadi complained that aside from being improbable, this did not explain why the prisoners had not received a trial for the charge of giving support to the enemy. A report by Geoffrey Robertson QC accused Tehran of continuing to deny relatives of the victims their right to know where their loved ones are buried.\n\nOne anonymous ex-prisoner places the death toll in the 'thousands.' Another eyewitness puts in between 5000 and 6000 – 1000 from the left and the rest from the Mojahedin. Yet another estimates it in the 'thousands', with as many as 1500 killed at Gohar Dasht prison alone. A recent study using scattered information from the provinces places the figure at 12,000. Amnesty International estimates that the national total is more than 2500 and describes the vast majority of the victims as 'prisoners of conscience' as they had not been charged with actual deeds or plans of deeds against the state.\n\nIt is extremely difficult to get an accurate number since many killings were carried out in remote Kurdish and Baluchi cities. It could be as high as 30,000 according to figures provided by Iranian defectors. In the aftermath of the 2009 uprisings in Iran, a defector of the Iranian regime Mohammad Nurizad stated over 33,000 people were massacred within 2–3 months in the summer of 1988. It is estimated that most of the executed were either high school or college students or fresh graduates, and over 10% were women. According to Christina Lamb, writing in \"The Telegraph\": \"Secret documents smuggled out of Iran reveal that, because of the large numbers of necks to be broken, prisoners were loaded onto forklift trucks in groups of six and hanged from cranes in half-hourly intervals.\"\n\nOn 30 August 2017, the United Nations Human Rights Council highlighted the 1988 massacre and distributed a written statement by three non-governmental organizations titled, \"The 1988 Massacre of Political Prisoners in Iran: Time for the Truth, Justice, Reparation and Guarantees of Non-Recurrence\" The statement points to the following: In 1988, the government of Iran massacred 30,000 political prisoners. The executions took place based on a fatwa by Supreme Leader Ayatollah Khomeini. Three-member commissions known as a ‘Death Commission’ were formed across Iran sending political prisoners who refused to abandon their beliefs to execution. The victims were buried in secret mass graves. The perpetrators continue to enjoy impunity.\n\nAnother joint written statement by five NGOs with consultative status with the United Nations was circulated during the UN Human Rights Council in February 2018 urged “UN to launch fact-finding mission to investigate Iran’s 1988 massacre in order to end impunity and prevent the same fate for detained protesters.”\n\nOne of the consequences of the killings was the resignation of Hussein-Ali Montazeri as the heir-designate to Ayatollah Khomeini as Supreme Leader of Iran.\nPrior to the killings, Montazeri \"had taken issue with the diehard cleric on a number of subjects – the trial of Mehdi Hashemi, the anti-hoarding campaign ...\" When he heard of the killings Montazeri rushed off three public letters – two to Khomeini, one to the Special Commission – denouncing the executions \"in no uncertain terms.\" He also took the Special Commission \"to task for violating Islam by executing repenters and minor offenders who in a proper court of law would have received a mere reprimand.\" Montazeri warned Khomeini: \"The execution of several thousand prisoners in a few days will not have positive repercussions and will not be mistake-free.\"\n\nMontazeri was asked to resign, with Khomeini maintaining he had always been doubtful of Montazeri's competence and that 'I expressed reservations when the Assembly of Experts first appointed you.'\" But the Assembly of Experts had insisted on naming Montazeri the future Supreme Leader.\n\nThe regime published letters between the two Ayatollahs but \"the selection dealt only with the Hashemi affair and scrupulously avoided the mass executions – thus observing the official line that these executions never took place.\"\n\nOn 9 August 2016, a website run by followers of Montazeri published an audio recording from a meeting he held on August 15, 1988 with the special judicial tribunal (Tehran Prosecutor Morteza Eshraghi, Judge Hossein-Ali Nayeri, Deputy Prosecutor General Ebrahim Raeesi and MOIS representative in Evin Mostafa Pourmohammadi). One can hear Montazeri condemning the mass executions. The Ministry of Intelligence and Security (MOIS) had the recording taken down the day after its release.\n\nOne complaint made against the mass killings was that almost all the prisoners executed had been arrested for relatively minor offenses, since those with serious charges had already been executed. The 1988 killings resembled the 'disappearances' of prisoners in 20th-century Latin America.\n\nAccording to Kaveh Shahrooz, writing in Gozaar, a publication sponsored by Freedom House, \"it is baffling that two of the world's most powerful human rights organizations, Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch, have simply never written full reports on a crime as widespread as the 1988 extermination campaign.\"\n\nWhile Amnesty International's report \"Iran: Violations of Human Rights 1987-1990\" published in 1990 devotes a few pages to the massacre, the human rights organization has never written a full report on the killings. The Amnesty International report states:\n\nThe political executions took place in many prisons in all parts of Iran, often far from where the armed incursion took place. Most of the executions were of political prisoners, including an unknown number of prisoners of conscience, who had already served a number of years in prison. They could have played no part in the armed incursion, and they were in no position to take part in spying or terrorist activities. Many of the dead had been tried and sentenced to prison terms during the early 1980s, many for non-violent offences such as distributing newspapers and leaflets, taking part in demonstrations or collecting funds for prisoners' families. Many of the dead had been students in their teens or early twenties at the time of their arrest. The majority of those killed were supporters of the PMOI, but hundreds of members and supporters of other political groups, including various factions of the PFOI, the Tudeh Party, the KDPI, Rah-e Kargar and others, were also among the execution victims.\nSimilarly, Human Rights Watch devotes a mere handful of pages to the massacre in a background report concerning President Ahmadinejad's cabinet picks.\n\nHuman Rights Watch (HRW) has described the executions as \"deliberate and systematic ... extrajudicial killings,\" and has condemned them as crimes against humanity. HRW has also accused Mustafa Pour-Mohammadi, Iran's Interior Minister from 2005–2008, of direct involvement in the killings.\n\nUN Judge and leading human rights lawyer, Geoffrey Robertson QC has urged the UN Security Council to set up a special court, along the lines of the International Tribunals for Yugoslavia and Rwanda, to try the men involved \"for one of the worst single human rights atrocities since the Second World War.\"\n\nScholars disagree over why the prisoners were killed. Ali Akbar Mahdi believes the intense overcrowding of Iranian prisons and the July 1988 Mojahedin Operation Mersad offensive \"had much to do\" with the massacre. Ervand Abrahamian believes the \"regime's internal dynamics\" were responsible – the need for \"a glue\" to hold \"together his disparate followers\" and a \"bloodbath\" to \"purge\" moderates like Montazeri and prevent any future \"détente with the West\" from destroying his legacy. In particular the killings destroyed any ties, or possibility of ties, between populists in the Khomeini movement on the one hand, and non-Khomeiniist Islamist and secular leftists on the other. Khomeini had been concerned that \"some of his followers had toyed with the dangerous notion of working with the Tudeh Party to incorporate more radical clauses into the Labor Law as well as into the Land Reform Law\" earlier.\n\nIn 2012 the families of the victims, along with the survivors of the mass executions initiated an international Commission, the Iran Tribunal, in order to investigate the mass killing of Iran's political prisoners. \"Iran Tribunal\" is aiming to hold the Iran's Islamic Regime accountable for its crimes against humanity. The first session of court hearing was organized in London and the second one at The Hague Peace Palace.\n\nPour Mohammadi, who was speaking in the administrative council meeting in the city of Khorram-Abad in Lorestan province, on 28 August said: \"We are proud we have implemented God’s order about Mojahedin (PMOI or MEK).\"\n\n\n"}

{"id": "1437631", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1437631", "title": "Armed Forces of Malta", "text": "Armed Forces of Malta\n\nThe Armed Forces of Malta is the name given to the combined armed services of Malta. The AFM is a brigade sized organisation consisting of a headquarters and three separate battalions, with minimal air and naval forces. Since Malta is the guardian of the European Union's most southerly border, the AFM has an active role in border control.\n\nIn April 1800, while the blockade of Valletta was underway, Thomas Graham raised the first official Maltese Troops in the British Army, which became known as the Maltese Light Infantry. This battalion of men was disbanded in 1802 and succeeded by the Maltese Provincial Battalions, the Malta Coast Artillery and the Maltese Veterans. In 1815, Lieutenant Colonel Count Francis Rivarola was entrusted with the task of raising the Royal Malta Fencible Regiment following the disbandment of the Provincials, Veterans and Coast Artillery. The Royal Malta Fencible Regiment was converted to an artillery regiment in 1861, and became known as the Royal Malta Fencible Artillery. Twenty-eight years later, the worthy predecessors of the Armed Forces of Malta came into existence following the formation of the Royal Malta Artillery on March 23, 1889.\n\nThe King's Own Malta Regiment was a territorial infantry regiment on the British Army colonial list. It was formed in 1801 as the \"Regiment of Maltese Militia\", existing only until the following year. It was reformed as the \"Maltese Militia\" by Sir Adrian Dingli in 1852 before disbanding again in 1857. It was raised again, this time as the \"Royal Malta Regiment of Militia\" in 1889; this regiment was considered to be the successor to the \"Maltese Chasseurs\" of the early 19th century. The regiment was renamed the \"King's Own Royal Malta Regiment of Militia\" in 1903, and was disbanded in 1921. The regiment was raised for a fourth time in 1931 as the \"King's Own Malta Regiment\". Initially on the British Establishment, in 1951 it was transferred to the Malta Territorial Force before becoming part of the Malta Land Force on Malta's independence in 1970. The regiment was disbanded in 1972.\n\nThe AFM was formed upon Malta becoming a republic in 1974, when 1 Regiment Royal Malta Artillery was renamed as 1 Regiment, AFM. This initially continued the artillery role, with 2 Regiment formed as an engineers unit. In 1980, 1 Regiment became a mixed unit, with infantry, aircraft and maritime responsibilities, the artillery element being transferred to 2 Regiment. In 1992, there was a major re-organisation, which led to the formation of 3 Regiment and the current structure.\n\n\nHQ AFM is the main command centre for the Armed Forces of Malta, and is divided into four main areas.\n\n\n1st Battalion is Malta's infantry unit, and has primary responsibility for the territorial defence of the country. It is divided into three rifle companies, a support company and a headquarters company.\n\n\n3 Battalion is the AFM's main support unit, and consists of three operational sections.\n\n\nEstablished with the AFM review of Oct 30th, 2006, it includes:\n\nThe Air Wing of the Armed Forces of Malta is the aerial component of the current Maltese military. The Air Wing has responsibility for the security of Maltese airspace, conducts maritime patrol and Search and Rescue duties, and provides military assistance to other government departments of Malta. With air wing of armed forces of Malta being based at Malta international airport\n\nThe Maritime Squadron of the Armed Forces of Malta is the naval component of the current Maltese military. The Maritime Squadron has responsibility for the security of Maltese territorial waters, maritime surveillance and law enforcement, as well as search and rescue. It is based at Hay Wharf (Xatt it-Tiben) in Floriana. It currently operates 10 patrol vessels and 6 other boats.\n\nIn addition to the regular forces, there is also the Volunteer Reserve Force, which consists of part-time volunteers to support the regulars at Air Defence & Support Company (ADSC), 1 Regiment AFM.\n\nThe presence of the Italian Military Mission (IMM) in Malta has taken form in the shape of technical assistance spread over three periods of time; firstly, between 1973 and 1979, then between 1981 and July 1988, and lastly from July 1988 to November 7th, 2016, when its last helicopter left Malta.\n\nIMM personnel resources in Malta totalled to 12 Officers and 35 NCOs from the three Service branches of the Italian Armed Forces. It was also equipped with two AB 212 helicopters, 15 heavy plant vehicles, 60 light all-purpose utility vehicles, radio telecommunications, and weapons.\n\nThe rank insignia for commissioned officers for the army and Maritime Squadron respectively. \nThe rank insignia for enlisted personnel for the army and Maritime Squadron respectively.\nSince Malta's entry in the European Union, the AFM has become more engaged in Peace keeping missions. The AFM has participated in 7 overseas operations.\n\nOn land, 1 Regiment is the designated home of the Maltese Infantry with C (Special Duties) Company being at the cutting edge of this unit. The company is being trained and equipped to be able to contribute a platoon for overseas humanitarian and rescue missions attached to an Italian regiment on missions mandated by the UN or the OSCE. Malta has to ensure that the troops are adequately trained and equipped up to Italian army standards for seamless integration within an Italian regiment, able to tackle any foreseeable problems for up to a year. C (Special Duties) Company is also being geared for a quick reaction role, ready for action at a moment’s notice should an emergency, such as terrorism, arise.\n\nThe kit used by the Maltese foot soldier has changed drastically in recent years. The fiat for change was given to C Company prior to its successful participation in the multi-national Partnership for Peace exercise in 1996. Following Malta’s pledge towards the EU’s Military Headline Goal in 2000, procurement received another boost.\n\nWith funding being a perennial problem, over the years the Force had to rely on varied equipment transferred or financed by several countries. Standardisation was a headache. But matters have improved considerably, especially with regard to light infantry weapons. At one time there were as many as eight different types of pistol and associated ammunition, now there are two, principally the Beretta FS and some Makarov. The army has also bought Heckler and Koch sub-machine guns and, thanks to Chinese assistance, all infantrymen now have their own individual AKM rifle.\n\nThe Maltese Infantry soldier is equipped with the latest British Army issue Personal Load Bearing Equipment including both the webbing and bergen as well as the woodland pattern battle dress uniform, Avon S10 respirator and Kevlar ballistic helmet. Protective ballistic vests and night vision goggles are carried when required.\n\nInfantry soldiers have a number of weapons at their disposal including the Kalashnikov AK-47 and AKM rifles, the Heckler and Koch MP 5 sub-machine guns, the Beretta 92 FS pistols, the PKM machine gun, as well as the General Purpose Machine Gun L7A1. Sniper teams are equipped with the Accuracy International sniper rifle while the anti-tank troops embedded within the infantry platoons carry the RPG-7 rocket launcher.\n\nEight-man sections are deployed either on Landrovers or Iveco VM-90 trucks.The AFM also operates a number of Bedford trucks which, despite their age, still give excellent service. Suffice to say that these trucks were driven in convoys all the way to Kosovo and back three times in 2001 and not one of them broke down. The Explosives Ordnance Disposal Unit is equipped with two remote controlled Explosive Ordnance Disposal Vehicles – robots used to disable a bomb from a safe distance. The first was bought in 1989 and a second, much more sophisticated one, was bought last year.\n\nThe Air Defence Battery forms part of 2nd Regiment and operates Bofors 40L/70 anti-aircraft guns and four barrelled ZSU-4 heavy machine guns. The Bofors guns can be operated either manually or electrically and they can be laid on their targets either visually or through radar. The 14.5mm machine guns can only be operated manually but they provide a high rate of fire. Air defence posed particular problems because of the passage of time on the Bofors guns, built in the early 1950s.\n\"See: AFM aircraft\"\n\n\"See: AFM maritime patrol vessels\"\n\nThe AFM wears a single cap badge, based on that of the Royal Malta Artillery, which consists of a gun, similar to that worn by the Royal Artillery but without the crown, on top of a Maltese Cross, with the motto \"Tutela Bellicæ Virtutis\" underneath.\n\n"}
{"id": "58535876", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=58535876", "title": "Ateyyat El Abnoudy", "text": "Ateyyat El Abnoudy\n\nAteyyat El Abnoudy (born October 26, 1939 - October 5, 2018) also known as Ateyyat Awad Mahmoud Khal ,was an Egyptian journalist, lawyer, actress, producer, and movie director. She was born in a small village along the Nile Delta in Egypt. El-Abnoudy is considered to be one of the pioneer Arab female movie directors as her films have inspired the works of many Arab women in the industry. She has been nicknamed the \"poor people's filmmaker\" due to the subject matter that inspired her to make films: civil rights issues and the unfortunate living circumstances of impoverished Arabs. \n\nAteyyat El Abnoudy has been the recipient of many awards for her films. Her film, \"Horse of Mud (1971)\" won her three international prizes. In 1972, Abnoudy also won the French Critics Prize at Grenoble Film Festival. El-Abnoudy was one of the earliest Arab women filmmakers to have been working in Egypt, and led the way for many other film-making Arab women to pursue a career in the industry. \n\nAteyyat El Abnoudy began her early life being raised in a small village by her two parents in a working class family. El-Abnoudy attended the University of Cairo where she began working at a theatre and as an actress to put herself through school and to attain her law degree. This is where she met her first husband, a journalist and poet named Abdel-Rahman El Abnoudy. Because of Abdel's career, Atteyyat was in the arts circle which meant networking with many writers, poets, and the artistic types of Egypt. She gives thanks to one of the people who helped her in her journey Nasser, his coming into power allowed for the filmmaker to attend post-secondary and take further steps to beginning her career.\n\nWhile deciding on where she fits in the film world, Ateyyat worked in many different roles in the theater, such as stage manager and assistant. When she found her passion in film-making she decided to continue her education. In 1972 she attended Cairo’s Higher Film Institute to finish her film studies. In the two years she spent there, she created her first two films called \"Horse of Mud\", which she received awards for. At the time that film was created to filmmaker was still new to the industry.\n\nWhile Abnoudy was nearing her graduation date she was also in the process of creating her first documentary \"Horse of Mud\" . Abnoudy stated that she wanted to have what she referred to as a style of poetic realism. The ways in which she captured the images of her actresses was a way she states would show that the best. According to Van de Peer, the \"Horse of Mud\" wasn’t only Abnoudy’s first documentary, but it was also Egypt’s first documentary by a woman.\n\nAbnoudy worked on creating original work. Work that circulates are the lives that people in third world countries are living in as Van de peer states in his piece. She likes to focus on the things in our everyday lives that influence us. The impacts that society has on our lives. In terms of a poetic approach, a few of her movies are short films. Like the saying: a little says a lot, that is the way in which Abnoudy’s films speak to her viewers. She wants her audience to understand the message she is using her films to relay. Every time her films are watched she wants the viewer to learn her message and relate to the film in a new way each time\n\nAt the time that Abnoudy was in the process of sculpting her craft, according to Van de Peer in his articles, Egypt was undermining the freedom of expression, especially of women. Van de Peer states that the feminist documentary writer expresses her poetic realism, along with that Abnoudy uses her films \"Permissible Dreams\" (1982) and \"Responsible Women\" (1994) to make her viewers feel empathy and appropriation.\n\nThe interest that she had in law, her work as an actress, and the circle of people she surrounded herself with inspired her to become a filmmaker.\n\nAteyyat El Abnoudy started her acting career as a means to financially support herself in school while she studied journalism. When El-Abnoudy's career as a journalist began, she took a particular interest in the poor people of Egypt, specifically Cairo. This later inspired her to take up production and become a filmmaker who shined a light on some of the unfortunate life circumstances of those in Egypt. El-Abnoudy quickly became known by two titles: the \"poor people's filmmaker\" and the \"mother of documentaries\" as she inspired many Arab women filmmakers to follow in her footsteps. \n\nEl-Abnoudy started making films since 1971, most of which are known for dealing with political, social, and economic issues in Egypt. During the time she began making films Egypt had just overcome a long and complex colonial history with Britain. The film industry in Egypt was known for being very cultural and state endorsed, specifically to promote Arab filmmakers and censor what was being published in the country. Ateyyat El Abnoudy saw this as a challenge and, as one of the first female filmmakers, she directed her first documentary called \"Horse of Mud\" in \"1971.\" El-Abnoudy further contested the censorship of Egypt filmmakers when she became the first female to establish her own production company, Abnoud Film, supporting small filmmakers similar to her. \n\nHer first film, \"Horse of Mud (1971),\" is considered to capture the dignity of Cairo's poorest peoples. This film follows the process of brick-making, a repetitive, painful, yet necessary task. \"Horse of Mud,\" illuminates the struggles of surviving in Cairo as an impoverished person by intertwining brick-makers personal stories to the work they do to survive. \n\nAbnoudy was a female documentary writer who based her films on a connection, she wanted her audience to bond with the actors according to Van de Peer the Films \"Horse of Mud\" and \"Sad Song of Touha\" and \"The Sandwich\" were the winners of prizes from the foreign film festivals.\n\n\nThe Physicalities of Documentaries by African Women written by Stefanie Van De Peer\n\nPermissible Documentaries: Representation in Ateyyat El Abnoudy's documentaries written by Stefanie Van De Peer\n\nPopular Egyptian Cinema: Gender, Class, and Nation written by Viola Shafik\n\n on IMDb\n\n1993 Ateyyat El-Abnoudy interview with Kevin Thomas\n\nAteyyat El Abnoudy Interview with Rebecca Hillauer\n"}

It is committed to the security and continuity of the Jewish people and the State of Israel and combating antisemitism and bigotry.\n\nThe Mission of B'nai Brith Canada, as stated in the preamble to its constitution:\n\nB'nai Brith has taken upon itself the mission of uniting person of the Jewish faith in the work of promoting their highest interest and those of humanity; of developing and elevating the mental and moral character of the people of our faith; of inculcating the purest principles of philanthropy, honour and patriotism; of supporting science and art; alleviating the wants of the poor and needy; visiting and caring for the sick; coming to the rescue of the victims of persecution; providing for, protecting and assisting the aged, the widow and the orphan on the broadest principles of humanity.\n\nB'nai Brith Canada has had a presence in this country since its earliest days, with roots stretching back to 1875. It is Canadian Jewry's most senior human rights advocacy organization and is the only national independent voice speaking out on behalf of grassroots Jewish Canadians.\n\nIn 1875, Lodge No. 246 was the first lodge founded in Toronto Canada, followed soon after by another in Montreal. Many community leaders were associated with these lodges. Over time, a team of dedicated volunteers and professional staff engaged in combating antisemitism, bigotry and racism in Canada and abroad in addition to wide-ranging educational and social programming, community and volunteer services, and human initiatives. These and other activities undertaken are meant to reflect the organization's commitment to \"People Helping People.\"\n\nJust as B'nai Brith has grown and evolved over the years in order to respond to the particular needs of the time, so has Canadian Jewry undergone many transformations. Throughout, B'nai Brith has consistently employed its successful advocacy model of strong community, results-oriented grassroots activism.\n\nIn the first two decades of the 20th century B'nai B'rith launched three of today's major Jewish organizations: The Anti-Defamation League (ADL), and BBYO (originally B'nai B'rith Youth Organization). Later they would take on a life of their own with varying degrees of autonomy.\n\nIn January 2004, Shahina Siddiqui, executive director of the Islamic Social Services Association, filed a formal complaint against B'nai Brith Canada under the \"discriminatory signs and statements\" section of the Manitoba Human Rights Code. After speaking with several people who attended a Winnipeg conference on terrorism hosted by B'nai Brith Canada in October 2003, she wrote that the event was biased against Muslims and would encourage the response teams in attendance to engage in racial profiling. The Manitoba Human Rights Commission (MHRC) accepted the complaint and began an investigation that would last five years. In 2009, the MHRC issued a report that dismissed the complaint due to a lack of evidence. MHRC vice-chairwoman Yvonne Peters subsequently wrote that \"the full investigation of the complaint that took place was warranted\" and that \"the decision was based solely on the insufficiency of the evidence with respect to this particular section of the Human Rights Code.\"\nIn 2008, David Matas, B'nai Brith's senior counsel, sharply criticized the MHRC for its conduct during the investigation, stating that:\n\nThe [Manitoba] Human Rights Commission itself is supposed to be promoting human rights, but in our view in this process it's violating some pretty basic rights: a secret proceeding, a faceless accuser, failure to disclose documents. These are basic procedural rights that are being violated.\n\nWriting in the \"National Post\", Joseph Brean made several criticisms of the investigation:\n\nFollowing the release of the MHRC report, Matas accused MHRC vice-chairwoman Yvonne Peters of taking a contradictory position, stating that: \n\nSo what they're saying is that a full investigation is warranted even when there's no evidence, as long as the accusation is within the jurisdiction of the board. There's a lot of problems with this. What basically happened is that Siddiqui heard a rumour. She makes a complaint, as a result of which the commission goes on a five-year fishing expedition. They don't find anything. We're co-operating with them. And then they dismiss the complaint. That's not a proper procedure, in my view.\n\nMatas also criticized the procedures of the MHRC, stating that they will \"take an allegation, without evidence, and just run with it to see if it's true.\" The previous year, Matas in a submission in a Moon Report on Internet hate speech, Matas charged that Canada's human rights commissions have demonstrated \"a disastrous combination of investigative zeal and substantive ignorance.\" Although Matas stated that he does not believe Siddiqui acted in bad faith, he added that:\n\nThe people who run these procedures have to have a more objective viewpoint than the people who make the complaint.\n\nIn July 2009, B'nai Brith Canada issued a press release denouncing Carleton University for hiring Hassan Diab, who was alleged by French authorities to have been responsible for the 1980 Paris synagogue bombing. Diab was living under virtual house arrest at the time (he had been granted bail but under very strict conditions) due to an extradition request from France. Diab, who has denied any involvement with the synagogue bombing, has not been convicted of any crime. Within a few hours of the B'nai Brith Canada complaint, Carleton University announced that it would \"immediately replace the current instructor, Hassan Diab\" in order to provide students \"with a stable, productive academic environment that is conducive to learning.\" B'nai Brith executive vice-president Frank Dimant later stated that \"the university did the right thing.\"\n\nOn November 9, 2009, B'nai Brith Canada ran a full page ad in the \"National Post\" comparing radical Islam with Nazism. Frank Dimant, CEO of B'nai Brith, said \"overall, feedback from the ad has been very positive.\" At the same time, the ad drew the ire of the group Canadian Jewish Holocaust Survivors and the Canadian Association of Jews and Muslims.\n\nIn September 2014, Ontario lawyer Michael Mostyn was appointed CEO of B'nai Brith Canada, succeeding Frank Dimant upon his retirement after 36 years with the organization. In 2015, the organization indefinitely suspended publication of \"Jewish Tribune\" and announced the sale of its heavily mortgaged headquarters at 15 Hove Street.\n\nIn 2007, a group calling itself Concerned Members of B'nai Brith Canada charged that a new constitution had been passed despite a majority of members having voted against it at a general meeting. Henry Gimpel, a former Toronto lodge president, told \"The Forward\" that \"[t]here's too much of [B'nai Brith Canada] being run by one person.\" Frank Dimant, CEO of BBC, responded to the criticism over the constitution by saying that BBC followed proper governance procedures and that B'nai Brith International's Court of Appeal determined that the constitution was properly enacted. Gimpel and seven other BBC members were expelled in June 2008 for what a disciplinary committee determined to be \"conduct unbecoming a member.\" Gimpel referred to the committee as a kangaroo court.\n\nOn July 8, 2015, the \"Toronto Star\" reported that Dimant has demanded an annual retirement payout of $175,000, representing 75% of his former salary, which the B'nai Brith believes is too lucrative and will require the struggling charity to direct fundraising dollars to pay for Dimant's pension. Dimant has stated that the payout was approved by the organization's board, however, the \"Star\" cites an unnamed source as stating that the deal was arranged with little oversight while Dimant was still in charge. In the year following Dimant's retirement, B'nai Brith Canada put its \"state of the art\" care facility for Alzheimer's patients under insolvency protection while also trying to sell it. The project, initiated and led by Dimant, is a $16 million facility opened in 2013 but that been unable to attract enough patients, due to high fees for patients of $7,500 a month and the fact that it was not designed to be wheelchair accessible; the facility is losing $50,000 a month and owes $11 million to creditors.\n\nThe \"Toronto Star\" article also claimed that other issues left by Dimant's former management of B'nai Brith are a lack of records and record keeping and failure to always issue charitable tax receipts and poor corporate governance with approximately 50 people who had believed they were on various boards of B'nai Brith organizations learning that this is not the case, as Dimant's management had failed to file the correct paperwork with government agencies.\n\nDue to financial difficulties, including a decline in charitable donations in recent years, B'nai Brith also ceased publication of its newspaper, \"Jewish Tribune\" in 2015, and is selling its headquarters which carries two mortgages totalling nearly $4 million, though the building itself is assessed at slightly over $3 million. It was reported by \"The Forward\" in 2007 that the organization was struggling financially and mortgaged its head office in order to raise $850,000 to meet expenses.\n\nAccording to an article in \"The Forward\", B'nai Brith Canada had 4,000 full-dues paying members in 2007.\n\nB'nai Brith Canada owned and operated the weekly \"Jewish Tribune\" as a subsidiary publication. The newspaper claimed a circulation of over 62,000 copies a week which would make it the largest Jewish publication in Canada. Publication was suspended in early 2015.\n\nOn November 29, 2002, B'nai Brith Canada sued the Canadian government for \"failing to crack down on the fundraising efforts of Hezbollah\", by not adding Hezbollah's charity wing to the list of banned terrorist organizations; the military wing of Hezbollah was already listed, but not the entire organization. About a week later, Canada made the decision to designate all of Hezbollah as a terrorist organization.\n\nB'nai Brith Canada operates a 24-hour-a-day, seven-day-a-week 'Anti-Hate Hotline'. The hotline receives calls from those who feel they have suffered from antisemitism or discrimination and is one of the sources of the organisation's statistics for its Annual Audit of Antisemitic Incidents.\n\nB'nai Brith Canada has a notable track-record in uncovering instances of hate speech and antisemitism in the media. In February 2016, B'nai Brith exposed the Windsor, Ontario newspaper 'al Forqan' for calling terrorist attacks against Israeli civilians as \"sacred duty of JIhad.\" In July 2016, B'nai Brith Canada, together with the London Police Services, exposed 'al-Saraha,' a London, Ontario newspaper for denying the Holocaust.\n\nCentre for Community Action\nAffordable Housing\nCommunity Volunteer Service Programs\nLeague for Human Rights\n24-hour, 7-day-a-week Anti-Hate Hotline\nAnnual Audit of Antisemitic Incidents\nInstitute for International Affairs\nCanadian Israel Public Affairs Committee (CIPAC)\nGovernment Relations Office\nNational Task Force on Holocaust Education, Remembrance and Research\nOperation Thank You: Educational Initiative Honouring Canadian Troops in Afghanistan\nCommunications Department\nLegal Desk\nCampus Outreach Program\nYoung Leadership Development Groups\nNetwork of B'nai Brith Lodges\nSports Leagues\nJewish Canada Information Service\nAlzheimer's Residence, Toronto\n\nIt was on B'nai Brith Canada's recommendation that Canadian Prime Minister Stephen Harper was awarded B'nai B'rith International's Presidential Gold Medal to honor what it described as his commitment to the Jewish people and the State of Israel.\n\nAward-winning film producer Robert Lantos has been a long-time supporter of B'nai Brith Canada and in 2008 was awarded the organization's Award of Merit. Among the other Canadian notables to have received the Award of Merit of B'nai Brith Canada are Lindsay Gordon, Blake Goldring, Frank Stronach, Tony Comper, Al Waxman, Wallace McCain, Lloyd Axworthy, Mayor Jean Drapeau, George Cohon, Leo Kolber, former Liberal Prime Minister of Canada Paul Martin, hockey legend Jean Béliveau, Paul Tellier, former Ontario Premier Bill Davis, Ambassador Allan Gotlieb, Monty Hall, Surjit Babra and Walter Arbib, Izzy Asper, Guy Charbonneau, former Manitoba Premier Gary Filmon, former Liberal Deputy Prime Minister of Canada Herb Gray, former Alberta Premier Peter Lougheed, Edward Samuel \"Ted\" Rogers, former Alberta Premier Ernest Manning, and Calin Rovinescu.\n\n\n\n\n"}

The group received logistical help from the Soviet Union, and financial aid from the Comintern.\n\nThe main points of BPWU's program were: the democratic self-governance for West Belarus within Poland, introduction of an eight-hour working day, the recognition of the Belarusian language in Poland as a second official language, the cancellation of the \"colonization of Belarus\" by the Polish Osadniks, and the free distribution to peasants of land owned by landlords upon its confiscation. There was also a semi-official goal to unite all of Belarusians of West Belarus and East Belarus within one Soviet state, which in all practicality, was an act of treason against Poland.\n\n\"Hramada\" was formed legally in July 1925. Its leaders were among prominent members of the Belarusian national liberation movement of the early 20th century: Symon Rak-Michajloŭski has previously been a high-ranking diplomat for the Belarusian Democratic Republic, Branisłaŭ Taraškievič is known as the creator of the first modern Belarusian grammar.\n\nThe Polish authorities began to suppress the activities of the Hramada in late 1926 due to its policy coordination with the delegalized Communist Party of Western Belarus. Belarusian media in Poland faced increased pressure and censorship from the authorities.\n\nMembership numbers of the Hramada grew on a very fast pace with sometimes entire Belarusian villages becoming members. By November 1926 the party has enrolled 120,000 members, which is believed to be the largest political party in Belarusian history today, and one of the largest revolutionary-democratic organizations of its time.\n\nThe \"Hramada\" had party cells in the following powiats of the Nowogródek Voivodeship in Second Polish Republic: Baranovichi (Baranowicze), Bielsk, Valozhyn (Wołożyn), Vawkavysk (Wołkowysk), Vileyka (Wilejka), Wilno, Grodno, Dzisna, Kosava, Lida, Maladzyechna, Navahrudak, Pastavy, Pinsk, Slonim, Stouptsy and Sokółka.\n\nThe Belarusian Peasants' and Workers' Union \"Hramada\" established several periodicals devoted not only to politics, but also to culture and business, including \"Zyccio bielarusa\", \"Bielaruskaja niva\", \"Bielaruskaja sprava\", \"Narodnaja sprava\", and \"Nasa sprava\". The total circulation of publications of the Hramada in early 1927 was above 10,000 copies.\n\nThe Belarusian national movement in West Belarus (called Kresy macroregion in interwar Poland) grew more loyal to the Soviet regime and its communist ideology as the years went on. The Soviets also gained increasingly more control over the Belarusian Peasants' and Workers' Union, and gave the Belarusian national liberation movement in Poland a communist context. According to Polish sources in Belarus, the Hramada received not only logistical, but also physical help from the Soviet Union, and financial aid from the Comintern.\n\nThe connection between \"Hramada\" and the delegalized Communist Party of Western Belarus aided by Moscow was inevitably discovered by the Polish authorities. On 15 January 1927 some top activists of \"Hramada\" were arrested under the charge of subversive anti-Polish activities. The trial of the leaders of \"Hramada\" became known as the \"Trial of the Fifty Six\" (). The leaders including Branisłaŭ Taraškievič, Symon Rak-Michajłoŭski, Piotra Miatła, and Pavieł Vałošyn, were each sentenced to 12 years in prison. The Polish authorities handed them over to the Soviets in 1930 (Rak-Michajłoŭski, Vałošyn, Miatła) and 1933 (Taraškievič) in exchange for political prisoners held in the USSR (including the West Belarusian journalist and playwright Francišak Alachnovič). A few years later, all four former leaders of the \"Hramada\" were either executed by the Soviet regime as \"Polish spies\" or sent to perish in the GULAG.\n\nIn the aftermath of the party's de-legalisation, on February 3, 1927 a riot erupted in Kosava where the Soviet \"diversionist\" cell was already formed by Moscow with all required help. Polish police responded to attacks with fire, killing 6 people and wounding several dozens.\n\nAccording to historian Andrew Savchenko, by 1927 the \"Hramada\" organization was controlled entirely by agents deployed from Moscow, whose aim was to destabilize the region and recruit partisans. According to Polish media, the Hramada turned into a cover for infiltration of Poland by the Soviet Union. According to Savchenko, BPWU only theoretically demanded independence for Belarus, but in practice promoted only the idea of incorporating the ethnically Belarusian lands into the Soviet Union which meant yet another partition of Poland. The Russian agents attempted to isolate the Belarusian ethnic minority in Poland from the political process in the country. In turn, \"Hramada\" leaders did exactly what their Moscow advisers suggested they do, and disseminated Comintern propaganda, which resulted in the rapid growth of its rank and file. By March 1927 the party had 120,000 members. The membership of the Communist Party decreased at the same time by a thousand.\n\nIn Belarus, the BPWU is viewed positively by both the official regime and the opposition. It is seen as a mass democratic party that emerged in West Belarus as a response to harsh ethnic discrimination of the Belarusians in mid-war Poland. It is being pointed out that the Hramada was persecuted by both the Polish regime and by the Stalinist USSR.\n\n\n\n"}

The program was part of the Rudd government's economic stimulus package designed as a response to the 2007–2010 global financial crisis.\n\nThe program, totalling A$16.2 billion has three elements:\n\nThe program has attracted attention from critics of the government for alleged \"rorting\" (misappropriation of public funds) and for not delivering value-for-money outcomes. Instances of inflated quotes or new buildings that were not particularly useful to the school were reported. The Leader of the Opposition Tony Abbott called for a judicial inquiry into the BER and the Home Insulation Program, described by the opposition Liberal Party as \"failed programs\" and a \"waste of public money\". \n\nIn April 2010, the government announced the formation of the BER Implementation Taskforce \"to ensure projects are providing value for money\". Gillard defended the BER saying that it was \"already one of the most heavily scrutinised programs in the nation's history\" and that the program was the \"centerpiece\" of an economic stimulus package that helped to \"ensure that a generation of Australians weren't consigned to months or years of joblessness\".\n\nAfter the 2010 election BER moved under the portfolio of Senator Chris Evans. \n\nThe Taskforce, headed by Brad Orgill, former chairman and chief executive of UBS Australasia, delivered its report to Senator Evans on 15 December 2010. The report found that most of BER projects had been successfully delivered, with only 3% of the schools involved in the program making complaints. Projects in NSW received the most complaints. The third and final report by Brad Orgill found that BER projects in NSW, QLD and VIC overpaid for buildings by more than 25% on average compared to Catholic schools and more than 55% compared to Independent schools. The ANAO investigation into the project ruled that comparison with those projects were not valid as the standards applied to government school facilities were higher. \n\nEconomist Joseph Stiglitz commented in August 2010 that the government's stimulus package, including the BER, was well-designed by world standards and that some waste was inevitable.\n\nOn 25 March 2014 three Australian academics published a paper in the \"International Journal of Public Administration\" that\nargued that the BER program represents a \"'case study' of how governments should not pursue large-scale public expenditure programs\". The paper says that the BER illustrates the pitfalls of large-scale public expenditure programs, and that it did not provide value for money.\n\n\n"}

There are equivalent bodies at state level. The status of the Bundesrechnungshof, its members and its essential functions are guaranteed by the German Constitution (art. 114 paragraph 2 of the Basic Law), and regulated by other legislation (i.e. Bundesrechnungshof Act, Federal Budget Code). It is an independent judicial body, with around 600 employees. Its current President is Kay Scheller.\n\nThe institution is a supreme federal authority only as far as it administers internal tasks such as personnel affairs, management of buildings or clearance of travel expenses and the like.\nProcessing its core duties - auditing, reporting and counseling as external financial controllers - it is not part of the executive branch of Germany, but is positioned beyond the three classical constitutional powers.\nThe Bundesrechnungshof is not subordinated to the federal government.\nEven the legislative (parliament) cannot instruct it. At best, the parliament can ask the authority to audit certain issues.\nFrom the third power, justice, it differs firstly by freely choosing the subject matters it intends to audit and secondly by not delivering legally binding rules, but by issuing recommendations.\nBundesrechnungshof’s exact placement within a classical system of the division of powers is disputed.\n\nThe Bundesrechnungshof examines the financial management of the federal government, its various property funds and state-owned companies, carrying out sample audits of revenue and expenditure totalling over 500 billion Euros. Its audit mandate also covers social security institutions and the activities of the federal government in private-law enterprises of which it is a shareholder. This includes areas such as defence, roadworks, taxation, and the federal government's activity as a minority shareholder of the formerly nationalised railways, post, and phone companies (Deutsche Bahn AG, Deutsche Post AG and Deutsche Telekom AG respectively).\n\nThe Bundesrechnungshof makes recommendations on the basis of its audit experience and provides advice to the audited bodies, to the German Parliament and the Federal Government. Its consulting activities have steadily increased and set out significant recommendations for quality improvement, pointing out the potential for savings or increases in revenue.\n\nThe Bundesrechnungshof reports on its audit findings in management letters which are sent to the audited bodies for comment. In addition the Bundesrechnungshof submits an annual report (\"Observations\") to both Houses of the German Parliament, the Bundestag and the Bundesrat, as well as to the Federal Government. The annual report is also used as a basis for Parliament authorising the Federal Government's budget. The annual report is presented to the public at a federal press conference. The Bundesrechnungshof may at any time submit special reports on matters of major significance to both Houses of Parliament, and to the Federal Government.\n\nThe Bundesrechnungshof provides advice to the executive and legislative branches by including recommendations for improvement in its management letters and annual reports, as well as by commenting - orally or in writing - on topical issues such as government bills and major procurement projects, or in the course of the annual budget procedure.\n\nBy virtue of legislation regarding German reunification, the Bundesrechnungshof's new headquarters were transferred from Frankfurt am Main to Bonn, effective 1 July 2000. The Bundesrechnungshof also has a branch office in Potsdam.\n\nThe first precursor of that auditory branch in Germany is the Prussian Audit Office. Its name as \" comes from the medivial concept of a Chambres des Comptes overseeing the spending of the state. In medieval times it did have regulatory functions which it did loose to various administrative offices, so much that only reporting functions were left. The installation of a high office is influenced by the mismanagement of the Cabinet of Three Counts in Prussia (1702-1710).\n\nThe \" (Prussian High Audit Office) was founded in 1714 by King Frederick William I as the \" (General Audit Office), given more powers in 1723 becoming the \" (High War and Domains Audit Office).

It also has links to the Democratic Unionist Party and Ulster Unionist Party.\n\nFounded in 1961, in the belief that the Macmillan ministry had taken the party too far to the left, the club became embroiled in the decolonisation and immigration debate, inevitably highlighting the controversial issue of race, which has dominated its image ever since. By 1971, the club had 35 MPs, six of them ministers, and 35 peers, with membership (including branches) totalling about 10,000.\n\nIn 1982, the constitution was re-written, with more emphasis on support for the Conservative Party, but subsequent in-fighting over the club’s \"hard right\" agenda led to many resignations. In 2001, the Conservatives formally severed relations with the club, which has ceased to exercise significant influence, with full membership below 600.\n\nThe club was founded on 1 January 1961, by four young Conservative Party members, Paul Bristol (a 24-year-old shipbroker and the club's first chairman, who left the club in 1968), Ian Greig (Membership Secretary until 1969), Cedric Gunnery, (later President of the Eton Ramblers Cricket Club) (Treasurer until 1992) and Anthony Maclaren. The club was formed \"to force local party associations to discuss and debate party policy\". Its first general policy statement deplored the tendency of recent Conservative governments to adopt policies based upon expediency and demanded that instead Tory principles should be the guiding influence. It believed that the principles needing to be reasserted included the preservation of the constitution and existing institutions, the freedom of the individual, the private ownership of property, and the need for Britain to play a leading part in world affairs. It disliked what it regarded as the expediency, cynicism and materialism which motivated Harold Macmillan's government. In addition it was concerned that during this period \"the left wing of the Party (had) gained a predominant influence over policy\" and that as a result the Conservative Party had shifted to the left, so that \"the floating voter could not detect, as he should, major differences between it and the Socialists\" and, furthermore, \"loyal Conservatives had become disillusioned and dispirited\". The club’s published aims stated that it “seeks to evolve a dynamic application of traditional Tory principles\".\n\nThe group brought together supporters of White Rhodesia and South Africa; the main impetus for the group's formation was the Conservatives' new decolonisation policies, in particular as a general reaction to Macmillan's 'Wind of Change' speech made in South Africa. The club stated that Macmillan had \"turned the Party Left\", and its first pamphlet opposed these policies, as indicative of the Conservative Party's move towards liberalism. The club is notable for having promoted a policy of voluntary, or assisted, repatriation for non-white immigrants.\n\nThe 5th Marquess of Salisbury (1893–1972), who had resigned from Macmillan's Cabinet over the Prime Minister's liberal direction, became its first president in January 1962, when he stated \"there was never a greater need for true conservatism than there is today\". By the end of 1963 there were eleven Members of Parliament in the Club, which then had an overall membership of about 300.\nThe club was courted by many Conservative politicians, including the Conservative Party leader Sir Alec Douglas-Home who was guest-of-honour at the club's annual dinners of 1964 and 1969, and Enoch Powell, who, in a speech in 1968, claimed that \"it was due to the Monday Club that many are brought within the Conservative Party who might otherwise be estranged from it\".\n\nThat year Alan Clark joined the club and was soon chairman of its Wiltshire branch. Under its chairman from 1964 to 1969, Paul Williams, who until 1964 had been MP for Sunderland South, the club enjoyed significant growth and influence. Some argued that the club had a disproportionate influence within Conservative circles, especially after six of its members who were MPs joined the Cabinet in 1970.\n\nHarold Wilson, twice Labour Prime Minister, described the club as \"the guardian of the Tory conscience\". Oxford political scholar Roger Griffin referred to the club as practising an anti-socialist and elitist form of conservatism.\n\nBy 1970 eighteen Members of Parliament were club members:\n\nIn the 1970 Conservative Party election victory, six MPs who were club members were given government positions. In addition, the following club members were elected that year:\n\nAmong sitting MPs who joined the club after that and other elections, along with those who became MPs were:\n\nPeers of the House of Lords who were Monday Club members:\n\nOther notable members:\n\nA number of other Monday Club members contested Labour-held seats, some of which had large majorities, and although the challenge was unsuccessful the majorities were reduced. These included Tim Keigwin, who almost unseated the Liberal leader Jeremy Thorpe at North Devon, and David Clarke whose personal campaign assistant was the Chairman of the Club's Young Members' Group, Christopher Horne, and who failed by only 76 votes at Watford.\n\nBy 1971, the club \"undoubtedly had the largest membership of any conservative group and included 55 different groups in universities and colleges, 35 Members of Parliament with six in the government, and 35 Peers\". At the club’s Annual General Meeting on 26 April 1971, in Westminster Central Hall, the Chairman, George Pole, announced that \"our membership, including national, branches and universities is around 10,000.\"\n\nJohn Biggs-Davison, MP, in his foreword to Robert Copping's second book on the history of the club, stated that \"by its principles [the club] has kept alive true Tory beliefs and held within its ranks many who contemplated defecting from the Conservative and Unionist Party\". The club's chairman in June 1981, David Storey, described it as \"an anchor to a ship\", referring to the Conservative Party.\n\nThe club's revised constitution (21 May 1984) stated that \"the objects of the Club are to support the Conservative & Unionist Party in policies designed:\nDuring the period that Margaret Thatcher led the Conservative Party, the Monday Club were prolific publishers of booklets, pamphlets, policy papers, an occasional newspaper, \"Right Ahead\", and a magazine \"Monday World\" edited for some years by Sir Adrian FitzGerald, Bart., Sam Swerling, and later, Eleanor Dodd. In the October 1982 edition MP Harvey Proctor called for the scrapping of the Commission for Racial Equality, Sir Patrick Wall commented on the Falklands War, James Molyneaux had an article \"What Future for Ulster\", and Dr. Harvey Ward had an article on \"Zimbabwe Today\". The September 1984 edition of \"Monday News\" carried the headline \"Kinnock Talks to Terrorists\", quoting former Labour Party leader Neil Kinnock's declaration to the African National Congress's Oliver Tambo that the ANC in South Africa could expect financial and material assistance from a future Labour government. Other attacks were made upon then-Greater London Council leader Ken Livingstone inviting Sinn Féin leader Gerry Adams to visit London in 1982.\n\nIn 1988–9, a group of longstanding members led by Gregory Lauder-Frost, the club's Foreign Affairs Committee chairman, succeeded in getting elected to the key posts on the Executive Council, with Dr. Mark Mayall as Deputy Chairman, and Lauder-Frost as the Political Secretary.\nAt the beginning of January 1991, the \"Monday Club News\" announced the abolition of the only salaried position, that of Director (then held by the Club's Treasurer, Cedric Gunnery, one of the Club's founders). Although this was due to the club's precarious financial state, some felt more sinister moves afoot. Negative news stories began emerging and resignations followed. An internal investigation followed. The chairman, David Storey, lost an almost unanimous vote of no confidence on 17 January 1991, and his membership was terminated by the club's Executive Council on 11 February on the grounds that \"he has engaged in behaviour prejudicial to the best interests, reputation, objects, and other members of the Monday Club; by abusing his position as Chairman in encouraging members to leave the Monday Club and to join a new political group\". Dr. Mayall became Acting Chairman until the May AGM when he was confirmed in that post by election. By 1992, the new team had the national (as opposed to branches) membership over 1600 again.\n\nPersonal legal problems forced Lauder-Frost's departure on 31 May 1992 and subsequently the club descended into in-fighting, with more departures and failed expulsion attempts resulting in huge legal bills. Dr. Mark Mayall's term as chairman expired in April 1993 and he left the group. Control passed effectively into the hands of Denis Walker, a former Minister for Education in the Rhodesian government. He changed the role of the club from a pressure group to a Conservative Party support group, bringing in a rule that all members must firstly be members of the party, something that prior to 1992 had been constantly opposed.\n\nThe national club established its offices at 51-53 Victoria Street, a few minutes walk from the Palace of Westminster. The club was, however, always a pressure group, remaining separate from the Conservative Party organisation. Around 1980, the Victoria Street building was cleared for demolition, and the club moved its offices to 122 Newgate Street, London, EC1, opposite the Old Bailey. High rents forced another move to 4 Orlando Road, Clapham Common, and finally, in 1991, the club's office was moved to an office belonging to W. Denis Walker, opposite Highams Park railway station, with new telephone numbers, and a new Post Office Box number in central London. The newsletter stated that \"it is our long-term aim to relocate back to the very heart of London\".\n\nIn addition to the national club, which operated through an elected Executive Council and numerous policy groups or committees, there were semi-autonomous county branches, a Young Members Monday Club, and numerous university Monday Clubs, the most prominent and active being at the University of Oxford.\n\nThe Monday Club had various study groups (later renamed policy committees) including:\n\nThe club was anti-communist and had an active Defence Committee chaired for over 15 years by Sir Patrick Wall, MP, MC, and produced much literature on the perceived threat posed by Soviets and communists everywhere.\n\nWhen it appeared that communism was failing in the Eastern Bloc, the club's Foreign Affairs Committee called upon Members of Parliament to be ready and to argue for the German borders to be restored to the position they stood at on 1 January 1938, saying there must be no gains for communism.\n\nClub officers, including Gregory Lauder-Frost, Denis Walker, and Lord Sudeley, attended a Western Goals Institute dinner in September 1989 in honour of Salvadorian president Alfredo Cristiani, whose military was at the time fighting the FMLN.\n\nThe club also took a hard line on the return of White Russians by the British Army to Joseph Stalin's Red Army in 1945–6, who executed nearly all of them. In this respect it gave its support to Count Nikolai Tolstoy, historian and author of \"Victims of Yalta\" and \"The Minister and the Massacres\", who was then being sued for libel, by holding a dinner for him at London's Charing Cross Hotel on 26 October 1988.\n\nThe club opposed what it described as the \"premature\" independence of Kenya, and the breakup of the Central African Federation, which was the subject of its first major public meeting in September 1961. It was fundamentally opposed to decolonisation, and defended white minority rule in South Africa and Rhodesia.\n\nDuring the Unilateral Declaration of Independence (UDI) period in Rhodesia, the club strongly backed the White minority government of Ian Smith and the Rhodesian Front, being seen as its strongest supporters in Britain. In November 1963, the club had hosted a large reception for Smith at the Howard Hotel in London. That was followed the next year by receptions for Clifford Dupont and Moise Tshombe. The club continued its support for white minority rule in South Africa, with Lauder-Frost organising a large dinner in central London, on 5 June 1989, for its guest-of-honour Dr Andries Treurnicht, Leader of the Conservative Party of South Africa, and his delegation. Tim Janman, MP, and the Lord Sudeley were amongst those present from Parliament.\n\nThe government of Franjo Tuđman in Croatia invited the Monday Club to send a delegation to observe its conflict with Serbia, in October 1991, when the war for Croatian independence from the tottering Yugoslavia was at its height, with the armies of both sides engaged in serious fighting. The Club delegation arrived just days after the Yugoslav Air Force bombing of the historic upper city in Zagreb. It was the first British political delegation to go to Croatia during the conflict.\n\nDebate within the club was intense on the European issue. In the early days of the European Economic Community (EEC) one of the club's MPs, Geoffrey Rippon, was so pro-EEC that he was known as \"Mr. Europe\". Because of the divisions within the club on this issue the decision was taken not to have a policy on it. However, by 1980 the mood had changed. A club discussion paper in October 1980 was entitled \"Do Tories Really want to Scrap 80% of Britain's Fishing Fleet\", and the club adopted a firm anti-European Union (EU) position. Teddy Taylor, an anti-EEC MP, became chairman of the club's EEC Affairs Policy Committee and authored a club policy paper in December 1982 entitled \"Proposals to Rescue the British Fishing Industry\". The club's Scottish branch's newspaper, \"The Challenger\", carried a further article against the EU by Taylor in September 1985 entitled \"Swallowing the Nation\".\n\nEnoch Powell also spoke against the EU at one of the Monday Club's fringe meetings at the Conservative Party Conference at Blackpool on 8 October 1991, with Lauder-Frost presiding, which was filmed and broadcast on BBC TV's \"Newsnight\" that night. In 1992, the chairman, Dr. Mark Mayall, authored another club booklet entitled: \"Maastricht: The High Tide of European Federalism\", a fierce attack on the EU.\n\nIn September 1972, the club held a \"Halt Immigration Now!\" public meeting in Westminster Central Hall, opposite Parliament, at which the speakers Ronald Bell, QC, MP, John Biggs-Davison, MP, Harold Soref, MP, and John Heydon Stokes, MP, (all club members) called on the government to halt all immigration, repeal the Race Relations Act, not the separate Commonwealth Immigrants Act 1968, and start a full repatriation scheme. A resolution was drafted, approved by the meeting, and delivered to the Prime Minister, Edward Heath, who replied that \"the government had no intention of repealing the Race Relations Act\". When Reginald Maudling resigned from the Cabinet, the Liberal leader, Jeremy Thorpe, commented that \"Mr. Heath has been left to wrestle with the Monday Club single-handed.\"\n\nIn October 1982, the Monday Club published its latest, slightly revised, policy on immigration. It called for:\n\nThe club's position on immigration was reiterated in a letter in \"The Times\" from Lauder-Frost on the club's behalf in October 1991 where he stated that the annual levels of immigration \"were unacceptable\" and called for \"the strictest possible entry to Britain for those of other cultures\".\n\nFollowing an Official Irish Republican Army (IRA) bombing at Aldershot, Hampshire, in February 1972, club member and MP Jill Knight called for legislation to outlaw the Official IRA and its political wing, Official Sinn Féin. The club was opposed to the dismantling of the Stormont government in Northern Ireland and the imposition of direct rule. On 7 September 1989, Lauder-Frost, on behalf of the Club, denounced \"the disgraceful Anglo-Irish Agreement\" in \"The Sun\".\n\n\"The Guardian\" claimed in 1968 that the organisation was \"probably the nearest British equivalent to the American John Birch Society\". It was claimed by opponents of the club that many members had drawn closer to the National Front, it being reported as early as 1973 that NF members were moving to take over branches of the club. The bad publicity led to a crisis culminating in a series of purges, mainly in Club branches.\n\nIn his \"Diaries\", Alan Clark describes speaking to the Monday Club in 1982: \"I really cannot bear the Monday Club. They are all mad, quite different from its heyday, when it was a right-wing pressure group at the time of Ted Heath's Government. Now they are a prickly residue in the body politic, a nasty sort of gallstone.\"\n\nThe playwright David Edgar described the Monday Club, in 1986, as \"proselytis[ing] the ancient and venerable conservative traditions of paternalism, imperialism and racism.\"\n\nOn 24 February 1991, \"The Observer\" ran a lengthy article entitled \"Far Right takes over the Monday Club\", stating that a number of senior members had tendered their resignations in protest at the club's \"takeover\" by \"extreme right-wingers\", some of whom were also members of the Western Goals Institute. The Club's solicitors, Rubenstein, Callingham & Gale, sent a formal letter of protest to the editor of the \"Observer\" about the article, and demanded a right of reply for the Club. The editor agreed and Lauder-Frost, writing on behalf of the club, subsequently challenged the article's accusations in a Letter to the Editor, which was published the following Sunday. He denied that a takeover had occurred, claimed that none of the club's policies had changed and that its direction was consistent with its aims and historical principles.\n\nAfter the defeats in the 1997 general election and 2001 general election, the Conservative Party began decisive moves towards becoming more centrist; the 2002–2003 party chairman and future Prime Minister, Theresa May, would later state that it had been perceived by voters as the \"Nasty Party\". The then party leader, Iain Duncan Smith, suspended the Monday Club's longstanding links with the party in October 2001, saying his party would have nothing to do with the organisation unless it stopped making \"distasteful\" remarks on race and immigration.\nSince 1993 new full members of the club must be members of the Conservative Party, though there is no such requirement for associate membership. Monday Club observers, such as Denis Walker, have attended Democratic Unionist Party conferences.\n\nThe club has been sometimes described as \"far-right\" by journalists in newspapers across the political spectrum from \"The Daily Telegraph\" to \"The Guardian\" and, in 2002, as a \"bastion on the Tory hard right\" by the British Broadcasting Corporation. Thurlow, however, stated that it was doubted that members of the Monday Club were secret or even potential fascists. The club's agenda stresses support for what it calls \"traditional Conservative values\", including \"resistance to 'political correctness.\n\nFaction fighting within the club following Lauder-Frost's departure led to a period of instability and a resulting loss of membership. The club's influence declined. Although the Monday Club was a completely autonomous pressure-group and not part of the Conservative Party organisation, Conservative Party chairman David Davis informed the club's National Executive in 2001 that links between it and the party were being severed until it stopped promoting several of its (long-held and established) policies such as the voluntary repatriation of ethnic minorities. Davis later told the media: \"I have told them that until a number of things are concluded—particularly some concerns about the membership of the club, and a review of the club's constitution and a requirement that the club will not promulgate or discuss policies relating to race—the club is suspended from any association with the Conservative party\". Three MPs, Andrew Hunter, Andrew Rosindell and Angela Watkinson, were ordered to resign from the club.\n\nOn 10 May 2002, the BBC reported that the club sought to restore its links with the Conservative Party. At the following club Annual General meeting in April 2002, members approved two motions proposed by Michael Keith Smith, (also Chairman of the Conservative Democratic Alliance); one reaffirming the club's opposition to mass immigration, and another empowering Club officers to institute legal action against the Conservative Party following the club's 'suspension' by them. A third motion, asking the club to call for the sacking of John Bercow, then Shadow Chief Secretary to the Treasury, and former Monday Club member, for his \"hypocrisy\", was defeated.\n\n\"The Times\" reported (2 June 2006) that, as the club \"is now slowly nudging back into the mainstream, many members feel that it is time to return to the fold\".\n\nThe Monday Club, having changed its original \"raison d'être\" as a pressure group in 1993, and whose membership is now said to be back below 600, now has very little influence on the agenda of the Conservative Party. Many of its former members joined the (now-defunct) Conservative Democratic Alliance and the Traditional Britain Group.\n\n\n"}

It is commonly used in many countries worldwide, but with various meanings.\n\nIn most Australian states, the director-general is the most senior civil servant in any government department, reporting only to the democratically elected minister representing that department. In Victoria and the Australian Government, the equivalent position is the secretary of the department.\n\nThe Australian Defence Force Cadets has three Directors-General which are all one-star ranks:\n\nIn Canada, the title director general is used in the federal civil service, known as the Public Service of Canada. A director general in the federal government is typically not the most senior civil servant in a department. Directors general typically report to a more senior civil servant, such as an assistant deputy minister or associate deputy minister. The title \"director general\" is not usually used within the civil services of the ten provincial governments, nor the three territorial governments; instead, these civil services usually use the title \"executive director\", or \"director\". Deputy ministers are the highest level bureaucrat within the Canadian civil service at the federal, provincial and territorial levels. Deputy ministers are not politicians but professional bureaucrats. Outside the federal, provincial and territorial civil services, some public sector agencies such as school boards in Quebec use the title \"director general\".\n\nIn the European Commission and the Council of the European Union, each department (called a directorate-general) is headed by a non-political director-general. This is roughly equivalent to a British permanent secretary.\n\nIn France, the similar word président-directeur général (PDG) means the highest person in a company, who is at the same time chairman (\"président\") of board of directors and CEO (\"directeur général\"). From 2001 the two charges may be disjointed. The \"directeur général délégué\" has a role similar to that of a chief operating officer.\n\nFrench ministries are divided in general directorates (\"directions générales\"), sometimes named central directorates (\"directions centrales\") or simply directorates (\"directions\"), headed respectively by a \"directeur général\", a \"directeur central\", or a \"directeur\".\n\nIn Germany, \"Generaldirektor\" may be used for the CEO of a large and established concern, corporation, company or enterprise, particularly if subordinates have the title director. The title is, however, unofficial (theoretically any person, and even practically every entrepreneur with one employee, may call himself director-general) and by now largely out of use. Officially a GmbH has a \"Geschäftsführer\" (\"managing director\"), an Aktiengesellschaft, and a board of executive directors (Vorstand) with a chairman (Vorstandsvorsitzender).\n\nThe term is also used by German Institute Taipei, Germany's informal representative mission to the Republic of China (Taiwan), to refer to its head of mission.\n\nIn India, there is a Director General of Police and Director General of Income Tax in each state. The Assam Rifles is headed by the Director General of Assam Rifles. The Indian Coast Guard is headed by the Director General of Indian Coast Guard (DGICG). The National Security Guard is headed by the Director General of National Security Guard. The Central Armed Police Force are also headed by their respective Director Generals.\n\nIn Italy, the \"direttore generale\" of a company is a corporate officer who reports to the CEO (\"amministratore delegato\") and has duties similar to a chief operating officer.\n\nSome Italian ministries are divided into departments (\"dipartimenti\") who are in turn divided into general directorates (\"direzioni generali\") headed by a \"direttore generale\". Other ministries, who do not have departments, are directly divided into general directorates. In Italian provinces and greatest communes, \"direttore generale\" is a chief administrative officer nominated by the president of province or by the mayor. The title of \"direttore generale\" is also given to the chief executive of an \"azienda sanitaria\", a local public agency for health services.\n\nThe word Director-General was used in the Philippines as a highest ranking law enforcer, which means the head of a law enforcement agency. Such agencies are:\n\nA general director is the highest executive position in a Russian company, analogous to a US chief executive officer (CEO), or a UK managing director. The position exists for all Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS) legal forms (e.g. joint stock companies (AO) and limited-liability companies (OOO)), except for sole proprietorships (IP).\n\nThe general director is the \"single-person executive body\" of a company. He or she acts without power of attorney to represent the company, and issues powers of attorney to others. His or her powers are defined by the company charter, by decision of the general meeting of shareholders (AO) or participants (OOO), and by the board of directors.\n\nIn Spain, México, and other Spanish-speaking countries, the term \"director general\" of a company (similar to a US corporation) is either the general manager or CEO of the company.\n\nIn Sweden, the cognate word Generaldirektör (GD) is the generic title for the head of a State agency, unless otherwise prescribed by higher authority. For purposes of English translations, the word Director-General is officially used.\n\nIn the UK's Civil Service, a director-general is now usually a Senior Civil Servant (SCS) at Pay Band 3 Level who heads up a group of other Directors and reports directly to the Permanent Secretary of a department.\n\nFor historical reasons it has also been retained as the professional title of the chief executive officers in some organisations which predate the current SCS structure and therefore may be used by those people despite them working at different pay bands. For example, the head of the UK's internal Security Service MI5 is also called a Director-General, despite the fact that the post is at Permanent Secretary (Pay Band 4) level. (See Her Majesty's Civil Service#Grading schemes for details.) Other organisations include the chief executive of the British Broadcasting Corporation, who also use the title but have no link to the civil service grading structure.\n\nThis term is used in international organisations and government departments, although this sort of position is more commonly called an \"executive director\" or \"managing director\" in the United States.\n\nTypically, the chief administrative officer of an opera company in the US holds the title of \"General Director\". Such is the case with singer and conductor Plácido Domingo, who currently functions in that capacity for the Los Angeles Opera, as he had previously for the Washington National Opera. In another prominent example, Speight Jenkins served as the general director of the Seattle Opera for over three decades. General directors are often responsible for artistic decisions, such as which operas to perform and which singers to hire, in addition to financial matters. The Metropolitan Opera is one of the few exceptions among US opera houses; the head of its administration is known as a \"general manager\" rather than a general director.\n"}

The term is more fully stated as a feoffee to uses of the beneficial owner. The use of such trustees developed towards the end of the era of feudalism in the middle ages and became obsolete with the formal ending of that social and economic system in 1660. Indeed the development of feoffees to uses may have hastened the end of the feudal system, since their operation circumvented vital feudal fiscal mechanisms.\n\nThe practice of enfeoffing feoffees with fees, that is to say of granting legal seizin in one's land-holdings (\"holdings\" as only the king himself \"owned\" land by his allodial title) to a group of trusted friends or relatives or other allies whilst retaining use of the lands, began to be widespread by about 1375. The purpose of such an action was two-fold:\n\nThe effect was that on a man's death he appeared to hold little or no land, whilst in reality he had full use of it and of the revenues derived from it. If he was thought by the county escheator to have been a tenant-in-chief, a jury for an Inquisition \"post mortem\" would be convened to enquire into what manors he held from the king and who was his legal heir. Frequently the verdict of such inquisitions even in the case of the decease of the most influential men of the county, was \"he holds no lands of the king in this county\". Such reports can be a major source of confusion to the modern historian or biographer who is unaware of the operation of feoffees to uses. As McFarlane summarised \"it can make a great landowner (sic) appear to die a landless man\".\n\nTo effect such an arrangement a sealed charter was usually drawn up which specified all relevant matters, such as who the feoffees were to be, to whose use the feoffees were to hold the lands, for what period, who were the desired heirs of the settlor, what provision should be made for his widow, etc. Such charter appears as a conveyance or alienation, and may be mistaken as such by the unwary modern researcher. Likewise, such a charter may be misinterpreted by the modern observer as signifying that those named as recipients of the conveyance are themselves beneficial owners in the form of a commercial partnership, and therefore may be mistaken for wealthy men.\n\nFeoffee is thus a historical term relating to the law of trusts and equity, referring to the owner of a legal title of a property when he is not the equitable owner. Feoffees essentially had their titles stripped by the Statute of Uses 1535, whereby the legal title to the property being held by the feoffee was transferred to their \"cestui que use\". The modern equivalent of a \"feoffee to uses\" is the trustee, one who holds a legal and managerial ownership in trust for the enjoyment benefit and use of the beneficiary.\n\nThe term is still in occasional use today to mean a trustee invested with a freehold estate held in possession for a purpose, typically a charitable one. Some examples include: the trustees of the Chetham's Hospital charity in Manchester, in the towns of Colyton, Devon and Bungay in Suffolk, and the trustees of the Sponne and Bickerstaffe charity in Towcester, Northamptonshire. The Feoffees of St Michael's Spurriergate are the trustees of a charity that helps with the restoration of churches in York. In Ipswich, Massachusetts, the Feoffees of the Grammar School have been trustees of a piece of land donated for the use of the town since the 1600s. In the village of Ecclesfield, South Yorkshire, the feoffees contribute to looking after the fabric of the church, Church of St Mary, Ecclesfield and also make other donations for the benefit of the local population but in the past they used to have responsibility for law and order, punishment of the guilty and upkeep of the roads.\n\n\n"}

It was a response to concerns about the safety of new food additives. The amendment established an exemption from the \"food additive\" definition and requirements for substances \"generally recognized as safe\" by scientific experts in the field, based on long history of use before 1958 or based on scientific studies. New food additives would be subject to testing including by the \"Delaney clause\". The Delaney clause was a provision in the amendment which said that if a substance were found to cause cancer in man or animal, then it could not be used as a food additive.\n\nGenerally recognized as safe (GRAS) is a Food and Drug Administration (FDA) designation that a chemical or substance added to food is considered safe by experts, and so is exempted from the usual Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FFDCA) food additive tolerance requirements. The concept of food additives being \"generally recognized as safe\" was first described in the Food Additives Amendment of 1958, and all additives introduced after this time had to be evaluated by new standards.\n\nThe Delaney Clause is a provision in the amendment named after Congressman James Delaney of New York. \nIt said:\n\nthe Secretary of the Food and Drug Administration shall not approve for use in food any chemical additive found to induce cancer in man, or, after tests, found to induce cancer in animals.\n\nThe Delaney Clause applied to pesticides in processed foods, but only when the concentration of a residue of a cancer-causing pesticide increased during processing; for example when more of a pesticide was present in ketchup than in the raw tomatoes used to make it. (It never applied to pesticides in raw foods.) When the law was passed, \"neither advocates nor opponents of the policy, including FDA officials, believed it would have broad application, for only a handful of chemicals had then been shown to be animal carcinogens.\"\n\nThe Delaney Clause was invoked in 1959 when Arthur Sherwood Flemming, the Secretary of the Department of Health, Education and Welfare issued a statement advising the public about the possible contamination of substantial quantities of cranberries in Oregon and Washington with the herbicide aminotriazole, which the FDA had recently determined was a carcinogen (see Cranberry scare of 1959). Taking place the week of Thanksgiving, the announcement was referred to by many in the cranberry industry as \"Black Monday\" − sales plummeted, even though many government officials attempted to defuse the scare by declaring their intention to eat cranberries anyway. This episode is regarded as one of the first modern food scares based on a chemical additive.\n\nAs analytical chemistry became more powerful and able to detect smaller quantities of chemicals, and as chemicals became more widely used, regulatory agencies had an increasingly difficult time administering the Delaney Clause as it \"recognizes no distinctions based on carcinogenic potency and, at least in theory, it applies equally to additives used in large amounts and to those present at barely detectable levels. It thus takes no account of the actual risk a carcinogenic additive might pose.\"\n\nThe FDA was the first agency to have to confront this problem, with respect to the use of diethylstilbestrol to promote the growth of livestock used in meat production, which remained present in the meat. It addressed the issue by using quantitative risk assessment, declaring that if a carcinogenic food additive was present at a concentration of less than 1 part in 1,000,000, the risk was negligible. This standard became known as the \"de minimis\" exception to the Delaney Rule and was used throughout the FDA and other agencies.\n\nIn 1988 the United States Environmental Protection Agency eased restrictions on several pesticides which posed a \"de minimis\" risk to humans. This change was challenged by the Natural Resources Defense Council, and overturned in 1992 by the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals.\n\nPesticide use was removed from the Delaney Clause in 1996 by an amendment to Title IV of the Food Quality Protection Act of 1996 (P.L. 104-170, Sec. 404).\n\nThe Delaney prohibition appears in three separate parts of the FFDCA: Section 409 on food additives; Section 512, relating to animal drugs in meat and poultry; and Section 721 on color additives. The Section 409 prohibition applied to many pesticide residues until enactment of the Food Quality Protection Act of 1996. This legislation removed pesticide residue tolerances from Delaney Clause constraints.\n\nMany foods contain natural substances which are carcinogenic, for example safrole, which occurs in sassafras and sweet basil. Even these substances are covered by the Delaney clause, so that, for example, safrole may not be added to root beer in the United States.\n\n"}

It is Bulgaria's second-largest party by membership.\n\nGERB is headed by Prime Minister of Bulgaria Boyko Borisov, former mayor of Sofia, former member of the National Movement Simeon II, former personal guard of Todor Zhivkov in the 90s of the last century. They were close friends. The establishment of the party followed the creation of a non-profit organization with the acronym (in Bulgarian) GERB — \"Citizens for European Development of Bulgaria\", earlier the same year. The name of the party is not stated to be an acronym, but is spelled in all caps nonetheless.\n\nIn early January 2007, and early February 2007, the party came second in public polls on party support with around 14%, trailing the Bulgarian Socialist Party which had around 25%. Its stated priorities are fighting crime and corruption, preserving family as the cornerstone of society and achieving energy independence.\n\nGERB won the 2009 European Parliament election in Bulgaria with 24.36% of the vote. The party elected five MEPs and joined the European People's Party-European Democrats Group in the European Parliament (in the EPP section). On June 6, 2007 GERB applied formally to join as a member-party the European People's Party and joined EPP on February 7, 2008.\n\nGERB won the 2009 parliamentary elections, held a month after the European ballot, winning 39.7% of the popular vote and 117 seats (out of 240). After the elections, a new government was formed, led by Borisov, primarily with GERB members and with 5 independent ministers around Deputy Prime Minister Simeon Djankov. The reformist wing was responsible for some of the most significant legislative victories, including a Constitutional reform to ban tax increases. On 20 February 2013, the government resigned after nationwide protests demanding it to step down.\n\nGERB's candidates for the 2011 presidential election, Rosen Plevneliev and Margarita Popova (presidential nominee and running mate, respectively), won the elections on the second ballot with 52.6% of the popular vote.\n\nGERB won the 2013 parliamentary elections with 97 seats, receiving 30.5% of the popular vote. This made GERB the first governing party to be re-elected in the history of the post-communist Bulgaria. However, with lack of support from the other parties and designated to form a new government, Borisov refused the offer and so GERB went in the opposition. However, due to the collapse of the coalition government in 2014, GERB backed into power after the snap elections.\n\n"}

{"id": "57834358", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=57834358", "title": "Historiography in the Republic of Macedonia", "text": "Historiography in the Republic of Macedonia\n\nHistoriography in the Republic of Macedonia is the methodology of historical studies used by the historians in the country. It has been developed since 1991 when the republic proclaimed its independence. According to Stefan Troebst it has preserved nearly the same agenda as the marxist historiography from the times of the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia. In fact, in the field of historiography, Yugoslav communism and Macedonian nationalism are closely related. According to Ulf Brunnbauer, modern Macedonian historiography is highly politicized, because the Macedonian nation-building process is still in development. There is no place of diverging approaches in it for several reasons as economic limitations; failure of academic career and stigmatization as “national traitor”. Recently a nation-building project has been promoted to impose the deceptive idea, Macedonian nation is the oldest on the Balkans, with unbroken continuity from the antiquity to the modern times. Some domestic and foreign scholars have criticized this agenda, leading to the creation of a denialist historiography, whose goal has been to affirm the continuous existence of a separate Macedonian nation throughout history. This controversial masterpiece is ahistorical, as it projects modern ethnic distinctions into the past. Such an enhanced, ethnocentric reading of history contributes to the distortion of the Macedonian national identity and degrades history as an academic discipline.\n\nThe contemporary Macedonian historical narrative is rooted in communist groups active during the interwar period, especially in the 1930s, when the Comintern issued a special resolution in their support. Those circles were however not the first ones to develop separate Macedonian historical interpretations. In 1892 Georgi Pulevski, the first Macedonian national activist, completed a \"General History of the Macedonian Slavs.\" It was only after the Second World War, however, that those writings were widely appreciated, as prior to the establishment of Communist Yugoslavia, the existence of a separate Macedonian nation was still not recognized. \n\nThe gloriﬁcation of the Yugoslav Partisan movement became one of the main components of the post-war Yugoslav political propaganda. As result, the leader of the new SR Macedonia – Lazar Koliševski, initially proclaimed that its history has begun with the start of the communist struggle during the Second World War, while early 20th century events and organizations as the Ilinden Uprising and the IMRO were mere Bulgarian conspiracies. Following direct political instructions from Belgrade, those historical studies were expanded. New Macedonian historiography held, as a central principle, that Macedonian history was distinctively different from that of Bulgaria. Its primary goal was to create a separate Macedonian national consciousness, with “anti-Bulgarian\" or \"de-Bulgarizing\" trend, and to sever any ties to Bulgaria. This distinct Slavic consciousness would inspire identification with Yugoslavia.\n\nThe first national scientific institution in this field – the Institute for National History of the federate republic was established in 1948. The historiographic narrative in the first two decades afterwards was expanded to the early 19th century, in which, as it was believed then, was launched the history of the Macedonian people. However the personalities from the area included into the new masterpiece, played also significant role in the Bulgarian National Revival. Numerous prominent activists with pro-Bulgarian sentiments from the 19th and the early 20th centuries were described as (Ethnic) Macedonians. Because in many documents of that period, the local Slavic population is not referred to as \"Macedonian\" but as \"Bulgarian\", Macedonian historians argue that it was Macedonian, regardless of what is written in the records. They have claimed also that \"Bulgarian\" at that time was a term, not related to any ethnicity, but was used as a synonym for \"Slavic\", \"Christian\" or \"peasant\". \n\nEfforts were made since the late 1960s to include there also the Middle Ages. As result in 1969, the first academic \"History of the Macedonian nation\" was published, where many historical figures from the area, who lived in the last millennium as Samuel of Bulgaria, were described as people with \"Macedonian (Slavic) identity\". When the historians from the Skopje University published in 1985 their collection with documents on the struggle of the Macedonian people, they included into the excerpts of the medieval chronicles, a footnote for every use of the term Bulgarian. Almost all of the new historical agenda was traditionally claimed by the Bulgarian national historiography and till today it disputes the Macedonian historical readings.\n\nAfter the Republic of Macedonia gained independence in the late 20th century, the picture has not changed significantly. Macedonian historiography has not revised much of the Yugoslav past, because almost all of its historical myths were constructed during the communist era. The reluctance for a thorough reevaluation of Yugoslav communist historiography was mainly caused by the fact that the very Macedonian nation, state and language were a result of Yugoslav communist policies, where this historiography had played a crucial role. For the mainstream local establishment, an attitude against Communist Yugoslavia is seen as anti-Macedonism. \n\nMacedonian historiography became urgent in the early 21st century in the face of an unsure reevaluation of the Yugoslav past and of an uneasy articulation of a new anticommunist narrative. It has sought a new horizon behind the mythological symbolism of ancient Macedon. For that purpose the borders of the ancient entity were extended towards the north, much further than the borders of the historical state. According to this history, most of the cultural achievements of the Ancient Macedonians were actually (ethnic) Macedonian and therefore, Hellenism's true name would be Macedonism. This new historical trend is called antiquization, making the Macedonian nationality a thousand years older. In this narrative Ancient Macedonians were not Ancient Greek people and it maintains a separate existence of Ancient Macedonians in the Early Middle Ages, 800 years after the fall of the their kingdom, as well as, their admixture in the Byzantine Empire, with the arriving at that time early Slavic migrants.\n\nIn 2009 the first Macedonian Encyclopedia was issued by the Macedonian Academy of Sciences and Arts. The issuance of the encyclopaedia caused international and internal protest because of its content and its authors have been subjected to severe criticism. Even some Macedonian academics criticised the book as hastily prepared and politically motivated. Soon the scandalous encyclopaedia was withdrawn from the bookstores. Macedonian Canadian historian Andrew Rossos has published in 2008 the first professional English language overview of the history of Macedonia, however Stefan Troebst suggests that his narrative is enough affected by the views in the R. Macedonia and thus is representing the latest developments in the Macedonian historiography as viewed in Skopje.\n\nAfter the fall of Communism, historical revisionists in the Republic of Macedonia questioned the narrative established in Communist Yugoslavia. People such as Ivan Mikulčić, Zoran Todorovski and Slavko Milosavlevski tried to openly oppose to popular historical myths in the Republic of Macedonia. Mikulčić for example, proved through archaeological evidence that there weren't any ancient Macedonians when the Early Slavs arrived in Macedonia. He also found several Bulgars' settlements on the territory of the modern republic and argued the Slavs in Macedonia adopted the ethnonym \"Bulgarians\" in the 9th century. Todorovski has argued that all Macedonian revolutionaries from the early 20th century and beyond identified themselves as Bulgarians. Milosavlevski challenged the myth of the significant communists partisans resistance movement against the Bulgarian \"fascistic occupiers\" during the Second World War. Their studies became only exception for the new Macedonian historiography and most historians left loyal to the political elite with publications appropriating the Hellenistic part from the Macedonian past and that of the medieval Bulgarian Empire and Bulgarian national revival from the Ottoman period. \n\nThe policy to claim Ethnic Macedonian past during Ancient, Medieval and Ottoman times, is facing criticism by other academics and politicians in the country itself, as Denko Maleski, Miroslav Grčev, Ljubcho Georgievski and others. It demonstrates feebleness of archaeology and historiography, as well some kind of ethnic marginalization. These intellectuals from Macedonian elite, admit the distinct Macedonian nation is a recent phenomenon developed in the years around the Second World War. Such views are spread among well educated citizens that search for the scientific resolution of the nation-building problematic. Despite the leading establishment strongly opposes the articulation of such views, some prominent members of the elite disclose their rational views.\n\nThe mainstream European historiography maintains the idea of separate Macedonian nation was developed mainly during the Second World War and was adopted en masse immediately after it. Whether in antiquity the Ancient Macedonians were originally a Greek tribe or not, is ultimately a redundant question, claims Loring Danforth, while with the ongoing hellenization of Macedonia, they came to be regarded as \"northern Greeks\". John Van Antwerp Fine states that throughout the Middle ages and Ottoman era today Bulgarians and Macedonians comprised a single people. Per Bernard Lory the ethnic divergence between them occurred mainly in the first half of the 20th century. Alexander Maxwell maintains that scarcely by the middle of that century, Macedonians began to see Macedonian and Bulgarian loyalties as mutually exclusive. According to Eugene N. Borza, the Macedonians, who are recently emergent people, and have had no history, are in search of their past. This search is an attempt to help legitimize their unsure present, surviving in the disorder of the Balkan politics. Ivaylo Dichev claims that the Macedonian historiography has the impossible task of filling the huge gaps between the ancient kingdom of Macedon, that collapsed in 2th cent. BC, the 10th-11th cent. state of the Cometopuls, and the Yugoslav Macedonia established in the middle of the 20th cent. Despite the myths of national purity and continuity that came to dominate the official Macedonian historiography, what is usual on the Balkans, Ipek Yosmaoglu affirms there is not much to be gained from a search for Macedonian national lineage, because the Macedonian nationhood was shaped mainly in the decades following World War II.\n\nSurveys on the effects of the controversial nation-building project Skopje 2014 on the perceptions of the population of Skopje revealed a high degree of uncertainty regarding its national identity. Following the results of a supplementary national poll they show that there is a great discrepancy between the population’s sentiment and the narrative the state seeks to promote. According to F.A.K. Yasamee the Macedonians are a striking instance of the mutability of national identity. \n\nRecently Macedonian political elite seems interested in some debates about the national historical narrative with Bulgaria and Greece. With respect to the Macedonian narrative, both Greek and Bulgarian historiography have questioned its factual basis, because it was constructed to come into conflict with these older historiographies. Per Michael R. Palairet in the three-way dispute about Macedonia, the Bulgarian view is closer to the objective facts of the history than either the Greek or Macedonian, but the Macedonian historiographical version violates common sense and the historical record much more than the Bulgarian or the Greek ones.\n\nThe governments of Bulgaria and Macedonia signed a friendship treaty to bolster the complicated relations between the two Balkan states in August 2017. On its ground a joint commission on historical and educational issues was formed in 2018. This intergovernmental commission is a forum where controversial historical issues will be raised and discussed, to resolve the problematic readings of history. In June 2018, Greece and Macedonia also signed an agreement to end their long disputes, which would result in Macedonia being renamed the Republic of North Macedonia. It also provides for the creation of a \"historical\" commission similar to that of the treaty signed with Bulgaria. \n\nHowever with nationalism in three countries rising, there are still Greek and Bulgarian scholars to attempt to claim a Macedonian nation did not exist until middle of the 20th. century and therefore, it could not exist at the present. In Skopje, meanwhile, there are growing concerns, that the negotiations with the country’s neighbors over its history, may jeopardize the Macedonian government or, even lead to violence and internal clashes.\n\n"}

More than 10,000 people supported Loach's appeal.\n\nIn 2014, the party had 2,000 members and 70 branches across Britain. The organisation is affiliated at the European Union level with the Party of the European Left.\n\nThe party's primary aim is the followig:\nLeft Unity was founded by Ken Loach, who believed that there was an \"absence of a strong voice on the left\" and that \"the Greens are alone among the political parties in not standing up for the interests of big business\". Loach wanted a \"UKIP of the left\", \"a successful party to the left of Labour as UKIP appears to be a successful party to the right of the Tories\".\n\nLeft Unity is an anti-capitalist party, firmly opposed to \"austerity programmes which make the mass of working people, the old, the young and the sick, pay for a systemic crisis of capitalism\" and believes that such measures protect bankers and not ordinary people. According to Loach, \"an anti-austerity alliance is good, but the problem with [the Scottish National Party, Plaid Cymru and the Green Party is that] they're mainly social democratic parties\". Nick Eardley wrote for BBC News: \"Parties like his are needed to peddle a more radical message\".\n\nLeft Unity wants to end zero-hour contracts and the privatisation of public services in education and health. The party advocates common ownership and democratic control of \"the means of producing wealth\" and the reversal of what it sees as 30 years of neoliberalism, aiming to \"build international networks of solidarity to support any government introducing such measures within Europe and elsewhere\". It supports full employment \"through measures such as reduced working hours for all; spending on public housing, infrastructure and services; and the public ownership of, and democratic collective control over, basic utilities, transport systems and the financial sector\" and opposes \"the casualization of employment conditions and laws which restrict the right of workers to organise effectively and take industrial action\".\n\nThe party has been criticised by far-left political organisations who say that the party has a \"commitment to govern within the framework of capitalism\" and its economic programme \"is a left-Keynesian, reformist programme, which would leave more than half of the FTSE 100 companies still in private hands, despite phrases in it about a \"strategic vision of structural change\" and the principle \"from each according to their ability, to each according to their needs\", lifted from the \"Communist Manifesto\"\".\n\nAccording to Left Unity's 2014 constitution, the party aims to build a society with (at least in the medium term) a private sector within the framework of a radical Left National Plan. In 2014, the organisation was committed to a mixed economic structure, stressing the need for \"a democratically planned economy that is environmentally sustainable, within which all enterprises, whether privately owned, co-operatives, or under public ownership, operate in ways that promote the needs of the people and wider society\". The 2015 pre-general election Left Unity manifesto appears instead to pursue a more far-left line and refers to the needs for an economy \"run democratically, not controlled by the few in the interests of 1% of the population. This means the principle of common ownership of all natural resources and means of producing wealth\".\n\nAccording to Loach, and wishes to emulate \"the kind of economy that Syriza in Greece and Podemos in Spain are calling for\".\n\n the bedroom tax, the Right to Buy and other sales of social homes.

The party believes that capitalism ignores the ecosystem:\nEcological devastation, resulting from the insatiable need to increase profits, is not an accidental feature of capitalism: it is built into the system’s DNA and cannot be reformed away. Capitalism is increasingly demonstrating its total incompatibility with the maintenance of our ecosystem through its ruthless exploitation of ever scarcer natural resources, its pollution of the environment, the growing loss of biological and agricultural diversity and increasing climate change...\nWhen the politicians propose using market mechanisms to limit carbon emissions, it is clear that they cannot see a more democratic or sane way out of the climate crisis. International policies like carbon \"cap and trade\" that allow companies to buy the \"rights\" to pollute, or an ecotax that end up punishing the poor, are all measures that will not work in the long term to save the planet – instead giving the rich and powerful nations and individuals the right to continue to pollute legally.\nClimate change is now inevitable, the question is how much and for how long and how much damage will it do. For us, socialism is the best way to manage the resources of the planet and ensure their democratic distribution in such a way that we are not destroying the environment to make a profit – as the corporations and energy companies are. No more \"business as usual\" means ending business as the driving force of the economy and instead looking to human – and environmental – need not corporate greed. If we want to save the planet we need socialism and we need it soon.\n\nLeft Unity is anti-racist, pro-, feminist, opposes religious discrimination and ableism and supports the rights of asylum seekers and \"all those in need\". Left Unity's position on safe spaces has been criticised by some on the left and a draft amendment was proposed by the Communist Platform of the organisation.\n\nThe party has been defined as a \"radical socialist party with strong positions on ecology and feminism\" and \"has a commitment to women comprising at least 50% of its leadership\". Speeches deemed as supporting male privilege have been received negatively and it is claimed that \"Left Unity is set to be a self-consciously feminist organisation\".\n\nLeft Unity is opposed to xenophobia and Luke Cooper of the Anticapitalist Initiative introduced socialist policies on immigration and racism. According to Cooper, there is no non-racist immigration control:\nLeft Unity completely rejects all anti-immigration arguments and rhetoric. We believe mass migration has had, and always will have, an overwhelmingly positive impact on society... challenge[s] ideas in the labour movement, and even sections of the socialist movement, that openly support or implicitly endorse the idea of \"British Jobs for British Workers\". Immigration controls divide and weaken the working class and [are] therefore against the interests of all workers.\nThe party overwhelmingly voted in favour of this policy.\n\nLeft Unity has rejected left-wing Eurosceptic groups such as No2EU, a stance criticised by some other organisations. Instead, the organisation has allied itself with the pro-European Another Europe is Possible during the Brexit referendum campaign.\n\nAt its conference in November 2015, the party adopted documents describing the EU as \"a reactionary anti-working class unreformable institution\", but recognising that the 2016 referendum \"can only produce a reactionary exit that would benefit only the xenophobic right wing of the Tory party and of UKIP\". Thus the party described the vote to leave the EU as \"a disastrous outcome\", saying the following:\nThe party \"stands in solidarity with the Palestinian people in their struggle against oppression and dispossession\". It supports the Palestinian Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions campaign, calls for the return of Palestinian refugees and \"resolutely oppose[s] any expression of antisemitism, whether within the solidarity movement or elsewhere\".\nIn 2014, Left Unity was criticised by media outlets worldwide after a motion that called ISIS a \"stabilising force\" with \"progressive potential\" was proposed by two members at the party's annual conference. The motion received three votes (two from its proposers) and the conference overwhelmingly passed another motion that \"the people of Syria including the Kurds of Syria have the right to defend themselves against the Assad regime and against ISIS... ISIS is a reactionary and gruesome organisation which has caused suffering and death to the civilian populations of large parts of Syria and Iraq\". John Tummon, one of the proponents of the motion, later joined the Hazel Grove Labour Party in March 2016.\n\nAt its November 2015 conference, Left Unity agreed a motion condemning Russian attacks in Syria, calling for an end to all foreign intervention and opposing any British military intervention.\n\nAccording to the International Socialist Network's Autumn 2014 Discussion Bulletin, it was then part of Left Unity with members elected to the party's national council. The CPGB (PCC) Communist Platform supporters within Left Unity (Jack Conrad and Yassamine Mather) announced that platform's dissolution on 20 February 2016 following Left Unity's refusal to accept their motion. The CPGB (PCC) issued a statement condemning Left Unity's support for Labourism, Momentum and Jeremy Corbyn, emphasising the need for \"a real communist party\", adding that by its \"refusal to rethink its perspective [...] Left Unity has condemned itself to permanent irrelevance\".\n\nLeft Unity is generally based on individual membership rather than organisational affiliation.\n\nIn local elections on 22 May 2014, Left Unity stood 11 candidates in four districts: Wigan, Barnet, Exeter and Norwich. They received 1,038 votes out of 74,126 cast, or an average of 3.2 percent. In Wigan West, party candidate Hazel Duffy received 8.8%. Left Unity had its first council seat in Stoke-on-Trent between March and May 2015 after a councillor defected from the Labour Party.\n\nThe party stood ten candidates in the 2015 general election on 7 May 2015, seven of which were jointly candidates of Left Unity and of the Trade Unionist and Socialist Coalition (TUSC). A number of party candidates (some jointly with TUSC) also stood in local elections that day.\n\nLeft Unity was profoundly impacted by the Labour Party leadership election of September 2015, when Jeremy Corbyn was elected. During the leadership election, Left Unity opposed what it saw as a \"witch hunt\" against left-wingers who were not Labour Party members, but were allowed to vote for Corbyn as leader because of election rules that were changed under former leader Ed Miliband. However, it has been calculated that Corbyn would have won in the first round with 51% of votes, even without \"£3 registered supporters\", having gained the support of 49.6% of full members and 57.6% of affiliated (trade union) supporters.\n\nAccompanying Corbyn's campaign and unexpected election was a significant influx of several hundred thousand of new members and supporters, shifting the political direction and membership base of the party leftwards. In the weeks following Corbyn's election as Leader of the Labour Party, approximately 300 Left Unity members, including many prominent leadership figures, resigned and joined the Labour Party. The November 2015 Left Unity Party Conference was dominated by the issue of what to do now that the Labour Party was led by Corbyn, a leader with politics similar to those of Left Unity, but with a mass membership of socialists, compared to Left Unity's then 1,500 members—down from its 2014 peak of 2,000. Many of the motions discussed the possible dissolution of Left Unity as a political party, with party members joining either the Labour Party itself or Momentum. By July 2016, membership had fallen further to 1,230 members.\n\nIn the run-up to the Labour leadership election one year later, individuals who had retweeted Left Unity were accused of supporting rival parties and therefore expelled from the party, therefore being unable to vote in the leadership election. Left Unity and others on social media saw this as hypocritical and contributed to the rise of the hashtag #LabourPurge on Twitter.\n\nLeft Unity called for a victory for Labour in the 2017 general election.\n\nIn 2014, the organisation protested at then Education Secretary Michael Gove following the decision by two examination boards (AQA and OCR) within the United Kingdom to remove American literature from their set texts with a short sit-in protest in the Department for Education (DfE) headquarters in central London. Left Unity accused the new curriculum of propagating \"a more narrow teaching agenda in our schools\".\n\n"}

{"id": "658906", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=658906", "title": "Majority rule", "text": "Majority rule\n\nMajority rule is a decision rule that selects alternatives which have a majority, that is, more than half the votes. It is the binary decision rule used most often in influential decision-making bodies, including the legislatures of democratic nations.\n\nThough plurality (first-past-the post) is often mistaken for majority rule, they are not the same. Plurality makes the option with the most votes the winner, regardless of whether the fifty percent threshold is passed. This is equivalent to majority rule when there are only two alternatives. However, when there are more than two alternatives, it is possible for plurality to choose an alternative that has less than fifty percent of the votes cast in its favor.\n\nMajority rule is used pervasively in many modern western democracies. It is frequently used in legislatures and other bodies in which alternatives can be considered and amended in a process of deliberation until the final version of a proposal is adopted or rejected by majority rule. It is one of the basic rules prescribed in books like \"Robert's Rules of Order\". The rules in such books and those rules adopted by groups may additionally prescribe the use of a supermajoritarian rule under certain circumstances, such as a two-thirds rule to close debate.\n\nMany referendums are decided by majority rule.\n\nAccording to May, majority rule is the only reasonable decision rule that is \"fair\", that is, that does not privilege voters by letting some votes count for more or privilege an alternative by requiring fewer votes for its passing. Stated more formally, majority rule is the only binary decision rule that has the following properties:\n\n\nStrictly speaking, it has been shown that majority rule meets these criteria only if the number of voters is odd or infinite. If the number of voters is even, there is the chance that there will be a tie, and so the criterion of neutrality is not met. Many deliberative bodies reduce one participant's voting capacity—namely, they allow the chair to vote only to break ties. This substitutes a loss of total anonymity for the loss of neutrality.\n\nIn group decision-making it is possible for a voting paradox to form. That is, it is possible that there are alternatives a, b, and c such that a majority prefers a to b, another majority prefers b to c, and yet another majority prefers c to a.\nBecause majority rule requires an alternative to have only majority support to pass, a majority under majority rule is especially vulnerable to having its decision overturned. (The minimum number of alternatives that can form such a cycle (voting paradox) is 3 if the number of voters is different from 4, because the Nakamura number of the majority rule is 3. For supermajority rules the minimum number is often greater, because the Nakamura number is often greater.)\n\nAs Rae argued and Taylor proved in 1969, majority rule is the rule that maximizes the likelihood that the issues a voter votes for will pass and that the issues a voter votes against will fail.\n\nSchmitz and Tröger (2012) consider a collective choice problem with two alternatives and they show that the majority rule maximizes utilitarian welfare among all incentive compatible, anonymous, and neutral voting rules, provided that the voters’ types are independent. Yet, when the votersʼ utilities are stochastically correlated, other dominant-strategy choice rules may perform better than the majority rule. Azrieli and Kim (2014) extend the analysis for the case of independent types to asymmetric environments and by considering both anonymous and non-anonymous rules. \n\nBecause a majority can win a vote under majority rule, it has been commonly argued that majority rule can lead to a \"tyranny of the majority\". Supermajoritarian rules, such as the three-fifths supermajority rule required to end a filibuster in the United States Senate, have been proposed as preventative measures of this problem. Other experts argue that this solution is questionable. Supermajority rules do not guarantee that it is a minority that will be protected by the supermajority rule; they only establish that one of two alternatives is the status quo, and privilege it against being overturned by a mere majority. To use the example of the US Senate, if a majority votes against cloture, then the filibuster will continue, even though a minority supports it. Anthony McGann argues that when there are multiple minorities and one is protected (or privileged) by the supermajority rule, there is no guarantee that the protected minority won't be one that is already privileged, and if nothing else it will be the one that has the privilege of being aligned with the status quo.\n\nAnother way to safeguard against tyranny of the majority, it is argued, is to guarantee certain rights. Inalienable rights, including who can vote, which cannot be transgressed by a majority, can be decided beforehand as a separate act, by charter or constitution. Thereafter, any decision that unfairly targets a minority's right could be said to be majoritarian, but would not be a legitimate example of a majority decision because it would violate the requirement for equal rights. In response, advocates of unfettered majority rule argue that because the procedure that privileges constitutional rights is generally some sort of supermajoritarian rule, this solution inherits whatever problems this rule would have. They also add the following: First, constitutional rights, being words on paper, cannot by themselves offer protection. Second, under some circumstances, the rights of one person cannot be guaranteed without making an imposition on someone else; as Anthony McGann wrote, \"one man's right to property in the antebellum South was another man's slavery\". Finally, as Amartya Sen stated when presenting the liberal paradox, a proliferation of rights may make everyone worse off.\n\nThe erroneous priorities effect (EPE) states that groups acting upon what they initially consider important are almost always misplacing their effort. When groups do this they have not yet determined which factors are most influential in their potential to achieve desired change. Only after identifying those factors are they ready to take effective action. EPE was discovered by Kevin Dye after extensive research at the Food and Drug Administration. The discovery of EPE led to the recognition that even with good intentions for participatory democracy, people cannot collectively take effective actions unless they change the paradigm for languaging and voting. EPE is a negative consequence of phenomena such as spreadthink and groupthink. Effective priorities for actions that are dependent on recognizing the influence patterns of global interdependencies, are defeated by the EPE, when priorities are chosen on the basis of aggregating individual stakeholder subjective voting that is largely blind to those interdependencies. Dye's work resulted in the discovery of the 6th law of the science of structured dialogic design, namely: \"Learning occurs in a dialogue as the observers search for influence relationships among the members of a set of observations.\"\n\nSome argue that majority rule can lead to poor deliberation practice or even to \"an aggressive culture and conflict\". Along these lines, some have asserted that majority rule fails to measure the intensity of preferences. For example, the authors of \"An Anarchist Critique of Democracy\" argue that \"two voters who are casually interested in doing something\" can defeat one voter who has \"dire opposition\" to the proposal of the two.\n\nVoting theorists have often claimed that cycling leads to debilitating instability. Buchanan and Tullock argue that unanimity is the only decision rule that guarantees economic efficiency.\n\nSupermajority rules are often used in binary decisions where a positive decision is weightier than a negative one. Under the standard definition of special majority voting, a positive decision is made if and only if a substantial portion of the votes support that decision—for example, two thirds or three fourths. For example, US jury decisions require the support of at least 10 of 12 jurors, or even unanimous support. This supermajoritarian concept follows directly from the presumption of innocence on which the US legal system is based. Rousseau advocated the use of supermajority voting on important decisions when he said, \"The more the deliberations are important and serious, the more the opinion that carries should approach unanimity.\"\n\nMcGann argues that majority rule helps to protect minority rights, at least in settings in which deliberation occurs. The argument is that cycling ensures that parties that lose to a majority have an interest to remain part of the group's process, because the decision can easily be overturned by another majority. Furthermore, if a minority wishes to overturn a decision, it needs to form a coalition with only enough of the group members to ensure that more than half approves of the new proposal. (Under supermajority rules, a minority might need a coalition consisting of something greater than a majority to overturn a decision.)\n\nTo support the view that majority rule protects minority rights better than supermajority rules McGann points to the cloture rule in the US Senate, which was used to prevent the extension of civil liberties to racial minorities. Ben Saunders, while agreeing that majority rule may offer better protection than supermajority rules, argues that majority rule may nonetheless be of little help to the most despised minorities in a group.\n\nSome argue that deliberative democracy flourishes under majority rule. They argue that under majority rule, participants always have to convince more than half the group at the very least, while under supermajoritarian rules participants might only need to persuade a minority. Furthermore, proponents argue that cycling gives participants an interest to compromise, rather than strive to pass resolutions that only have the bare minimum required to \"win\".\n\nAnother argument for majority rule is that within this atmosphere of compromise, there will be times when a minority faction will want to support the proposal of another faction in exchange for support of a proposal it believes to be vital. Because it would be in the best interest of such a faction to report the true intensity of its preference, so the argument goes, majority rule differentiates weak and strong preferences. McGann argues that situations such as these give minorities incentive to participate, because there are few permanent losers under majority rule, and so majority rule leads to systemic stability. He points to governments that use majority rule which largely goes unchecked—the governments of the Netherlands, Austria, and Sweden, for example—as empirical evidence of majority rule's stability.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "48764123", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=48764123", "title": "Male warrior hypothesis", "text": "Male warrior hypothesis\n\nThe male warrior hypothesis (MWH) is an evolutionary psychology hypothesis by Professor Mark van Vugt which argues that human psychology has been shaped by between-group competition and conflict. Specifically, the evolutionary history of coalitional aggression between groups of men may have resulted in sex-specific differences in the way outgroups are perceived, creating ingroup vs. outgroup tendencies that are still observable today.\n\nAccording to this hypothesis, intergroup conflict represents an opportunity for men to gain access to mates, territory, and increased status. As such, conflicts may have created selection pressures for psychological mechanisms in men to initiate intergroup aggression. In women, intergroup conflict substantially increases the risk of sexual assault by outgroup men, and may have created selection pressure for psychological mechanisms that bias women against outgroup men.\n\nViolence and aggression are universal across human societies, and have likely been features of human behavior since prehistory. Archaeologists have found mass graves dating to the late Pleistocene and early Holocene that contain primarily male skeletons showing signs of blunt force trauma, indicating the cause of death was by weapons used in combat.\n\nViolence among humans occurs in distinct patterns, differing most obviously by sex. Ethnographic findings and modern crime data indicate that the majority of violence is both perpetrated by and targeted at males, and males are the most likely to be victims of violence. This male-male pattern of violence has been observed so repeatedly and in so many cultures that it may qualify as a human universal.\n\nHumans are a social species with a long history of living in tribal groups. The psychological mechanisms that evolved to handle the complexities of group living have also created heuristics for quickly categorizing others as ingroup or outgroup members, with different behavioral strategies for each: treat ingroup members (those in one’s own group) favorably, and react to outgroup members (those who belong to a different group) with fear and aggression. These tendencies arise with little motivation, and have been provoked over superficial groups in lab studies—for example, by showing paintings to participants and creating groups based on which painting participants prefer. Ingroup and outgroup preferences have also been observed in other social primates, such as the rhesus macaque.\n\nThe male warrior hypothesis suggests that the ease with which individuals discriminate against members of other groups is an adaptation resulting from a long history of being threatened by outgroup males, who are in competition for resources.\n\nThe MWH argues that the sex differences in attitudes towards outgroup members may be a result of the different reproductive strategies used by males and females—specifically, the greater competition among males for mates. In mammals, males and females have distinct reproductive strategies based on the physiology of reproduction. Because females gestate, birth, feed, and invest more overall resources in each of their offspring, they are more selective with their mates but have greater certainty of being able to reproduce.\n\nMales, in contrast, can mate at a very low energetic cost once they have found a partner, but are only able to attract a female if they have physical or social characteristics that can be converted into resources—e.g., territory, food resources, status, power, or influence—or the strength and alliances to coerce females to mate. As a result, there is typically much greater variability in the reproductive success of males within a species and higher competition among males for mates. The strongest, best adapted, and most powerful males may have a harem, while less fit males never reproduce.\n\nFor more details on this topic, see Trivers' theory of parental investment.\n\nThe male warrior hypothesis predicts that because males may have historically remained in the groups in which they were born rather than moving away at adulthood (see patrilocality), they have a higher overall relatedness to their group than the female members, who would have moved to their new husbands’ group upon marriage. Males may have a stronger interest in defending their group, and will be more likely to act aggressively towards outgroup males they encounter who may be attempting to steal resources or weaken the group with violence.\n\nFor men at risk of never finding a mate, the fitness benefit to engaging in aggressive, violent behavior could outweigh the potential costs of fightings, especially if fighting alongside a coalition. Furthermore, the groups with more individuals who formed coalitions and acted altruistically to in-group members but aggressively to outgroup members would prosper (see multi-level selection).\n\nConsistent with the expectations of the male warrior hypothesis, several studies have shown more ethnocentric and xenophobic beliefs and behaviors among men (compared to women), including the more frequent use of dehumanizing speech to describe outgroup members; stronger identification with their groups; greater cooperation when faced with competition from another group; a greater desire to engage in war when presented with images of attractive (but not unattractive) members of the opposite sex; greater overall rates of male-male competition and violence (as shown in violent crime and homicide statistics); and larger body size correlating with quicker anger responses.\n\nStudies have also tested the responses of women to outgroups, and have shown that women are most likely to fear outgroup males during the periovulatory phase of the menstrual cycle, when fertility is at its peak. Women also have more negative responses around peak fertility when the males belong to an outgroup that the woman associates with physical formidability, even if the group was constructed in the lab. Overall, women who feel most at risk of sexual coercion are more likely to fear outgroup males, which aligns with the predictions of the MWH.\n\nCoalitionary violence has also been observed in social species besides humans, including other primates. Chimpanzee (\"Pan troglodytes\") males demonstrate similar violent behavior: groups of males form coalitions that patrol the borders of their territory and attack neighboring bands. Chimpanzees also have patrilocal living patterns, which aid with forming close coalitions, as all males are likely kin.\n\nIn studies of prepared learning, conditioned fear responses to images of outgroup males were far more difficult to extinguish than conditioned fear responses to outgroup females or ingroup members of either sex, as measured by conductivity tests of perspiration on the skin. These results held true whether the participant was male or female. Because the neural circuitry for fear responses are more developed towards stimuli that have posed a larger threat for most of human history (snakes and spiders, for example, which were dangers frequently encountered by foragers), these findings suggest that outgroup males may have been more of a threat to physical safety than outgroup women or ingroup members, supporting the male warrior hypothesis.\n\nWhile the male warrior hypothesis is supported by a number of experimental studies in neuroscience and social psychology, the effects of war and aggression on human psychology are still up for debate. General questions include: A) why are sex differences found in some laboratory experiments or field studies but not in others? (B) do females prefer warrior behavior in males regardless of its risk? and (C) is female sexual selection for male peacefulness also conceivable?\n\n"}

Some have linked the increase in repression to the influence of the 'security cluster' under the Jacob Zuma presidency.\n\nIt has been argued that \"Zuma has enhanced the coercive capacity of the state\" and that he has focused on \"building a state based on fear\". It has also been argued that repression has affected poor people's organisations most seriously but that repression directed against poor people has been systemically under-reported in the media. It has been claimed that senior ANC politicians are responsible for the repression of grassroots activists.\n\nSerious concern has been expressed about police brutality in South Africa. Sipho Hlongwane, writing in \"Business Day\", has argued that \"South Africa is a brutal police state.\" According to Greg Marinovich \"The police are acting with impunity. Their political masters are acting with impunity. In the South Africa of 2012, if you are poor and without political clout, you are on your own.\" Amnesty International has expressed serious concerns about brutality, including torture and extrajudicial killings, at the hands of the police in South Africa. Ronnie Kasrils has argued that there has been a \"descent into police state depravity\" under Jacob Zuma. It has been observed that \"Torture is routine practice in South Africa's police stations and prisons\".\n\nUnder Jacob Zuma the ANC has expressed open opposition to media freedom. Serious concern has been expressed about the proposed Media Appeals Tribunal and Protection of Information Bill which, if passed, would significantly reduce press freedom.\n\nThere have been a number of reports of serious intimidation of journalists. In 2007 the Freedom of Expression Institute and \"The Mercury\" newspaper reported a death threat against a journalist in Durban by controversial local businessman Ricky Govender who claims close links with Jacob Zuma. In Durban in 2009 the editor of \"The Mercury\", Philani Makhanya, laid a charge of intimidation against S'bu Mpisani, a politically connected contractor for the housing department in that city who had allegedly threatened the newspaper for its investigations into his activities. In Port Elizabeth the branch chairperson of the ruling African National Congress (ANC), Nceba Faku, called for party supporters to burn down the offices of the local newspaper the \"Daily Dispatch\" in 2011. In 2012 Piet Rampedi and Adriaan Bassoon, journalists at the \"City Press\", were subject to various threats and forms of intimidation while covering a story on corruption by Julius Malema Also in 2012 ANC supporters publicly burnt copies of the \"City Press\" newspaper in Durban.\n\nPoet Mbongeni Khumalo has claimed \"that his no-holds barred lyricism attracted the attention of state security\".\n\nIn 2012 leading figures in the ruling party called for a painting, \"The Spear\", to be destroyed and publicly endorsed the defacement of the painting.\n\nThere have been a number of independently documented cases where the constitutionally protected right to protest has not been honoured by the state. One particularly well documented instance occurred in Durban in 2006 and another in Cape Town in 2012. It has also been claimed that the right to protest has been summarily denied to shack dwellers on the East Rand. It has been argued that not just ANC controlled municipalities, but also opposition Democratic Alliance (DA) ones, engage in unlawful bans on the right to protest. It has also been suggested that recent judicial interventions amount to a \"de facto\" curtailment of the right to protest. It has been argued that there was an increase in the unlawful banning of protests after the 2012 Marikana massacre and that this has taken the form of a \"de facto\" \"state of emergency\".\n\nThe police, which were demilitarised after apartheid have been remilitarised and some politicians have encouraged the police to 'shoot to kill'. In the view of some analysts this has contributed to escalating repression. Concern has also been expressed at use of tactical response teams to contain popular protest and at the idea that the army should support the police in containing popular protest.\n\nIn 2010 journalists Mzilikazi waAfrika was arrested at the offices of the \"Sunday Times\". Charges against him were later dropped. waAfrika's phone was also unlawfully tapped by the police. In July 2012 Nic Dawes, Sam Sole and Stefaans Brummer, journalists at the \"Mail & Guardian\", were questioned by the police following the publication of a story alleging corruption by senior ANC leader Mac Maharaj.\n\nThere have been numerous allegations from activists in grassroots social movements about arrests on trumped up charges and assaults at the hands of the police. For instance it was reported that Ashraf Cassiem from the Western Cape Anti-Eviction Campaign was assaulted by the police in 2000 while resisting an eviction and that S'bu Zikode and Philani Zungu from Abahlali baseMjondolo were arrested and assaulted while on the way to a radio interview in 2006. In September 2010 four residents of Hangberg, in Hout Bay, near Cape Town were shot in the face at close range by police with rubber bullets leading to the loss of their eyes. In February 2011 two protesters were killed by the police and a number subject to torture in Ermelo. In January 2012 it was reported that Ayanda Kota was assaulted in the Grahamstown police station. In August and September 2012 strikers and community activists in Marikana were subject to sustained police harassment, including a large number of fatalities. In October 2012 activists in Makause, on the East Rand, reported death threats from the police. In December 2012 it was reported that in Wesselton, Mpumalanga, police were engaged in sustained collective harassment, some of it violent, of a local community.\n\nThere has been general concern about police torture in South Africa, which has been described as \"occurring en masse\" and \"spiralling out of control\". In 1996 Kevin Kunene, founding chairman of the KwaMbonambi Environmental Group, was tortured by the police. Organisations such as the Landless People's Movement have documented cases in which activists and protesters have been tortured. There were media reports of police torture of activists in Wessleton, Ermelo, in 2011 and in Marikana in 2012.\n\"People Killed by the Police During Protests\"\n\nThe worst instance of lethal police violence in response to protest since the end of the apartheid era in South Africa is the shootings of 34 striking miners at Marikanan near Rustenburg, which have come to be known as 'The Marikana Massacre', during the Marikana miner strike on 16 August 2012.\n\nThe ICD has reported a rise in police violence against protesters since 2010 and a number of unarmed protesters have been killed by the South African Police Service since 2000. Four people were killed by the police during protests between 2000 and 2004, two in 2006, one in 2008, two in 2009, three in 2010 and eleven in 2011. The media have reported at least 27 police killings of protesters and bystanders (not including the 34 people killed in the Marikana Massacre) and a number of killings by private security guards since 2000.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Right2Know Campaign has documented several instances in which activists have been harassed by intelligence structures.\n\nOrganisations such as the Landless People's Movement, Abahlali baseMjondolo and the Unemployed People's Movement have been subject to armed political violence by groups claiming to represent the ruling ANC. The Makause Community Development Forum have also claimed to have been subject to state sanctioned violence by an ANC aligned 'mob'. There have also been cases where ANC supporters have disrupted protests organised by independent groups. One example of this was the attempt to disrupt a protest by the Moretele Concerned Communities Association in May 2012. It has been argued that the violence associated with the Marikana miners' strike in August 2012 began after officials of the National Union of Mineworkers murdered two strikers.\n\nGrassroots activists have been reporting fears that they may be killed since at least 2002. There have been reports of death threats against activists in Ermelo (2011), in Grahamstown (2011), in eTwatwa on the East Rand (2010), and in Durban (2006, 2009, 2012).\n\n\n\nIn July 2012 Alpheus Moseri (68) collapsed and died following an assault by MK Veterans at a lecture given by Jacob Zuma. In October 2012 COSATU President Sidumo Dlamini called for MK veterans to use \"their guerrilla military skills to work with us on the ground to defend this movement and our revolution as a whole\" In November 2012 it was reported that MK veterans had made threats against Deputy President Kgalema Motlanthe. In November 2012 it was reported that armed men claiming to be MK veterans stormed into an ANC branch meeting on the East Rand and threatened to shoot members of the branch if they did not nominate Zuma for re-election.\n\nAccording to Barney Pityana \"we are beginning to see the emergence of party (or presidential) militia in the guise of the Umkhonto weSizwe Veterans, who are the new Gestapo with a fascist agenda.\"\n\nIn Durban in 2013 the shack dwellers' movement Abahlali baseMjondolo secured five High Court injunctions against evictions which were \"systemically ignored by state actors who have repeatedly torn down the shacks of local residents\".\n\nAccording to Zwelinzima Vavi, COSATU Secretary General, \"The [ruling] party unfortunately has adopted in our view an unnecessarily hostile posture to some progressive civil organisations and coalitions, painted a number of organisations with the same brush and has tended to take the view that they are the product of external agendas.\"\n\n\n\n"}

The first PrepCom occurred from July 12 to July 23, 2010 at the United Nations in New York City. The second PrepCom occurred from February 28 to March 4, 2011 also in New York City. A third meeting is scheduled for July, 2011. The preparatory committees were designed to prepare member states, international organizations and non-governmental organizations for the Arms Trade Treaty negotiation in 2012. The Preparatory Committees are intended to prepare delegates and non-governmental organizations for the eventual Arms Trade Treaty negotiations, and is concerned with logistical, procedural and thematic issues.\n\nCountries in the United Nations have long been concerned about the lack of a global normative framework for guiding and governing international arms transfers. After years of international campaigning from individuals and states, the United Nations General Assembly voted in 2006 to negotiate an Arms Trade Treaty in 2012.\n\nWhen delegates of the United Nations decided that they would negotiate an Arms Trade Treaty in 2012, there emerged a sentiment to host a series of preparatory conferences for member states and civil society to arrange and organize the eventual negotiations. In order to do this, four preparatory committees (or “PrepComs”) were scheduled.\n\nThe first PrepCom occurred from July 12 to July 23 in 2010 at the United Nations in New York City. The 2010 PrepCom featured an opening statement from the high representative for disarmament affairs. The eventual outcomes of the 2010 PrepCom were the establishment of an outline for a draft Treaty, draft preamble, draft goals and objectives and three papers from the Friends of the Chair on scope, parameters and implementation of the eventual Arms Trade Treaty. \n\nThe third preparatory Committee will take place in July, 2011.\n\nIn addition to the four Preparatory Committees, a Group of Governmental Experts was assembled to debate and discuss potential challenges facing an Arms Trade Treaty.\n\nThe second PrepCom was attended by member states of the United Nations, non-governmental organizations, and international organizations. These participants were tasked with addressing the potential scope and parameters for an Arms Trade Treaty. The PrepCom conference was held in the United Nations Building in New York City.\n\nThe second PrepCom issued two definitive preparatory documents prior to the opening of the conference. Both a Provisional Agenda and a Provisional Programme of Work were issued and disseminated to PrepCom participants. These documents outlined the logistical timeline for the conference.\n\nThe second PrepCom had several key issues that it was tasked to address. Scope, criteria and parameters, and international cooperation and assistance were all given a full day of statements. The international organization Control Arms Coalition made a presentation. The chair, Roberto García Moritán, issued three papers on scope, criteria and parameters, and international cooperation and assistance; the chair also issued a draft paper.\n\n“Towards an International Arms Trade Treaty” UK Arms Control and Disarmament, UK Permanent Representative to the conference on Disarmament, February 22, 2011. https://web.archive.org/web/20110831203707/http://ukunarmscontrol.fco.gov.uk/en/the-uk-disarmament/armstradetreaty\n\n“What is the issue”, Arms Trade Treaty Preparatory Committee, United Nations, 2011. http://www.un.org/disarmament/convarms/ATTPrepCom/index.htm\n\n“Provisional Agenda, A/CONF.217/PC.II/L.1”, Preparatory Committee for the United Nations Conference on the Arms Trade Treaty, United Nations General Assembly, February 14, 2011.\n\n“Provisional Programme of Work, A/CONF.217/PC.II/L.2”, Preparatory Committee for the United Nations Conference on the Arms Trade Treaty, United Nations General Assembly, February 14, 2011.\n\n“Second Preparatory Committee on the Arms Trade Treaty”, Reaching Critical Will, March, 2011. https://web.archive.org/web/20110408130942/http://www.reachingcriticalwill.org/legal/att/prepcom2/index.html\n"}

{"id": "17539252", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=17539252", "title": "Security level management", "text": "Security level management\n\nSecurity level management (SLM) comprises a quality assurance system for electronic information security.\n\nThe aim of SLM is to display the IT security status transparently across a company at any time, and to make IT security a measurable quantity. Transparency and measurability form the prerequisites for making IT security proactively monitorable, so that it can be improved continuously.\n\nSLM is oriented towards the phases of the Deming Cycle/Plan-Do-Check-Act (PDCA) Cycle: within the scope of SLM, abstract security policies or compliance guidelines at a company are transposed into operative, measureable specifications for the IT security infrastructure. The operative aims form the security level to be reached.\n\nThe security level is checked permanently against the current performance of the security systems (malware scanner, patch systems, etc.). Deviations can be recognised early on and adjustments made to the security system.\nSLM falls under the range of duties of the Chief Security Officer (CSO), the Chief Information Officer (CIO) or the Chief Information Security Officer (CISO), who report directly to the Executive Board on IT Security and data availability.\n\nSLM is related to the disciplines of Security and Security Event management (SIEM), which the analysts Gartner summarise in their Magic Quadrant for Security Information and Event Management, and define as follows:\n\"[…] SIM provides reporting and analysis of data primarily from host systems and applications, and secondarily from security devices — to support security policy compliance management, internal threat management and regulatory compliance initiatives. SIM supports the monitoring and incident management activities of the IT security organization […]. SEM improves security incident response capabilities. SEM processes near-real-time data from security devices, network devices and systems to provide real-time event management for security operations. […]\"\n\nSIM and SEM relate to the infrastructure for realising superordinate security aims, but are not descriptive of a strategic management system with aims, measures, revisions and actions to be derived from this. SLM unites the requisite steps for realising a measurable, functioning IT security structure in a management control cycle.\n\nSLM can be categorised under the strategic panoply of IT governance, which, via suitable organisation structures and processes, ensures that IT supports corporate strategy and objectives. SLM allows CSOs, CIOs and CISOs to prove that SLM is contributing towards protecting electronic data relevant to processes adequately, and therefore makes a contribution in part to IT governance.\n\nDefining the Security Level (Plan): Each company specifies security policies. The executive management defines aims in relation to the integrity, confidentiality, availability and authority of classified data. In order to be able to verify compliance with these specifications, concrete aims for the individual security systems at the company need to be derived from the abstract security policies. A security level consists of a collection of measurable limiting and threshold values.\n\n\"Example: operative aims like \"the anti-virus systems at our UK sites need to be up-to-date no longer than four hours after publication of the current definition\" need to be derived from superordinate security policies like \"our employees should be able to work without being interrupted.\"\"\n\nLimiting and threshold values are to be specified separately and individually for different sites, locations and countries, because the IT infrastructure on-site and any other local determining factors need to be taken into consideration.\n\n\"Example: office buildings in the UK are normally equipped with high-speed dedicated lines. It is wholly realistic here to limit the deadline for supplying all computers with the newest anti-virus definitions to a few hours. For a factory in Asia, with a slow modem link to the web, a realistic limiting value would have to be set that is somewhat higher.\"\n\nThe IT control manual Control Objectives for Information and Related Technology Cobit (CobiT) provides companies with instructions on transposing subordinate, abstract aims into measurable aims in a few steps.\n\nCollecting and Analysing Data (Do):Information on the current status of the systems can be gleaned from the log file and status reports provided by individual anti-virus, anti-spyware or anti-spam consoles. Monitoring and reporting solutions analysing software applications from all software houses can simplify and accelerate data collection.\n\nChecking the Security Level (Check): SLM prescribes continual reconciliation of the defined security level with the current measured values. Automated real-time reconciliation supplies companies with a permanent status report on the security status across all locations.\n\nAdjusting the Security Structure (Act): Efficient SLM allows trend analyses and long-term comparative assessments to be made. Through the rolling observation of the security level, weak spots in the network can be identified early on and appropriate adjustments made proactively in the security systems.\n\nBesides defining the specifications for engineering, introducing, operating, monitoring, maintaining and improving a documented information security management system, ISO/IEC 27001 also defines the specifications for implementing suitable security mechanisms.\n\nThe IT Infrastructure Library (ITIL), a collection of best practices for IT control processes, goes far beyond IT security. In relation, it supplies criteria for how Security Officers can conceive IT security as an independent, qualitatively measurable service and integrate it into the universe of business-process-oriented IT processes. ITIL also works from the top down with policies, processes, procedures and job-related instructions, and assumes that both superordinate, but also operative aims need to be planned, implemented, controlled, evaluated and adjusted.\n\n"}
{"id": "5778180", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=5778180", "title": "Sociotherapy", "text": "Sociotherapy\n\nSociotherapy is a social science and form of social work, and sociology that involves the study of groups of people, its constituent individuals and their behavior, using learned information in case and care management towards holistic life enrichment or improvement of social and life conditions. \n\nThe professional practitioner of the field, who may be called a sociotherapist or life enrichment therapist, sometimes called a clinical sociologist, is usually concurrently a member of another relevant profession: medical doctor, psychiatrist, psychologist, nurse, social worker, sociologist, criminologist, activity and recreational professionals, among others. Clinical sociotherapy usually targets groups of children, youths or elderly, employed in various settings such as treatment facilities or lifecare communities like nursing homes and are directly involved in case management and care planning.\n\nStill in its infancy as a social science and profession, sociotherapy is ill-defined and thus takes many forms, according to the respective definitions created by the individual therapists, firms and institutions that employ sociotherapists and life enrichment therapists. The Society for the Furtherance of Sociotherapy defines sociotherapy as \"the methodical management of the living environment of a group of clients, directed towards reaching the treatment targets of this group—and conceived as a means of achieving the treatment targets of the individual client—within a functional unit, usually in a clinical treatment setting.\" This definition is most accepted especially in lifecare communities such as nursing homes.\n\nThe Sociotherapy Association in the United States describes a sociotherapy that emphasizes the support of awareness, relationship, and the integration of life and the environment. Its main focus is the process of interpersonal relationships as a method of facilitating healthier living, rather than diagnosing intrapsychic psychopathology, and attempting to change it through coercion and analysis (psychology and psychotherapy). The Society for the Furtherance of Sociotherapy says: \"Sociotherapy operates through a holistic vision of mankind. That is to say that the human being is seen as a somatic, psychic, social and spiritual unity, which is unique because of his own history of growth.\"\n\nDefinition of sociotherapy as a social science and profession is also based on regional dicta. For example, the public health insurance system of Germany offered a uniquely German definition in order to subsidize treatment by sociotherapeutic professionals. It said that sociotherapy \"designates non-medical, social, and work-related components of the care process\". \n\nSociotherapy has been used in the treatment and education of adolescents at Kanner Academy and Community Schools in Sarasota Florida US. In These settings the working definition of sociotherapy is the practice of promoting healthy growth and living by facilitating therapeutic communities, personal relationships and positive peer culture. It is better known as the \"relationship therapy\".\n\nRand L. Kannenberg wrote, \"Sociotherapy for Sociopaths: Resocial Group\". Designed by the author to help prevent relapse and rearrest of parolees and probationers at a community mental health center in 1986, this text outlines an evidence-based, twenty-four session group program created for adult clients with coexisting Substance Use Disorders and the persistent problems of aggressiveness, breaking rules and laws, carelessness, dishonesty, impulsivity, indifference, irresponsibility and irritability. The book examines the importance of sociotherapy or sociological counseling in the corrections and substance abuse fields. \n\"Kannenberg's fresh approach to treating psychoactive chemical abusing sociopaths should be in every counselor's arsenal when treating a client of this nature.\"\n\nThe Sociotherapy Association is certifying sociotherapists and support companions.\n\nThe foundation of any sociotherapeutic relationship include the practice of dialogical relationship, the phenomenological method, field-theoretical strategies, experimental freedom, countertransference (CT) management.\n\nSupport Companionship is a time tested method for helping people, who for one reason or another, are struggling in their lives. Support Companions provide wrap-around support to adults, adolescents, families, the elderly, children, and service providers, when the support is needed! The foundation of support companion services is relationship, and the methodology of contact is sociotherapy.\n\nSociotherapists are constantly involved in creating and refining theories in group and socialization dynamics. For example, a sociotherapist in a nursing home may experiment on the various methods one might employ to lure an introverted resident to activities and thus reduce the resident's risk of social isolation, which may be linked to the continued progression of that resident's dementia. In this example, the sociotherapist would also use activities like games and exercises to monitor an individual's mental health and use interaction with other residents as a tool to improve that mental health.\n\nThe goal of a phenomenological exploration is awareness. In Sociotherapy awareness and integration are central to healthy living. Much of the practice is centered around ways to support and improve a sense of awareness in our fields of experience. This is accomplished with relationship, experimentation and phenomenological exploration.\n\nThe phenomenological method comprises three steps: (1) the rule of epoché, (2) the rule of description, and (3) the rule of horizontalization.\n\nApplying the rule of epoché we sets aside our personal initial biases and prejudices in order to suspend expectations and assumptions. Applying the rule of description, one occupies oneself with describing instead of explaining. Applying the rule of horizontalization one treats each item of description as having equal value or significance.\n\nWhen it comes to a socio-therapeutic relationship the rule of epoché sets aside any initial theories with regard to what is presented in the meeting between therapist and client. The rule of description implies immediate and specific observations, abstaining from interpretations or explanations, especially those formed from the application of any clinical theory superimposed over the circumstances of experience. The rule of horizontalization avoids any hierarchical assignment of importance such that the data of experience become prioritized and categorized as they are received. \n\nAs envisioned by Husserl, phenomenology is a method of philosophical inquiry that rejects the rationalist bias that has dominated Western thought since Plato in favor of a method of reflective attentiveness that discloses the individual's \"lived experience\".\n\nIntersubjectivity emphasizes that shared understanding and consensus is essential in the shaping of our ideas, experiencing, and relations. Language, quintessentially, is viewed as communal rather than private. Therefore, it is problematic to view the individual as partaking in a private world, one which has a meaning defined apart from any other subjects. But in our shared divergence from a commonly understood experience, these private worlds naturally emerge.\n\n"}
{"id": "6140421", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=6140421", "title": "Sri Lankan state-sponsored colonisation schemes", "text": "Sri Lankan state-sponsored colonisation schemes\n\nSri Lankan state-sponsored colonization schemes refers to the government program of settling mostly farmers from the densely populated wet zone in the sparsely populated areas of the dry zone in the North Central Province and the Eastern Province regions near tanks and reservoirs being built in major irrigation and hydro-power programs such as the Mahaweli project to create farming and fishing communities. Since irrigation settlements in the North Central and Eastern Provinces occurred under direct state sponsorship, as most of these farmers are ethnic Sinhalese it appeared to many Tamils as a deliberate attempt of the Sinhalese-dominated state to marginalize them further by decreasing their numbers in the area. It has been perhaps the most immediate cause of inter-communal violence.\n\nShortly after independence, the government of Ceylon started a program to settle farmers in the jungles of Trincomalee District. The forests were cleared and water tanks restored. As a consequence of these schemes the Sinhalese population of Trincomalee District rose from 11,606 (15%) in 1946 to 85,503 (33%) in 1981. In the 1980s the government extended the colonization schemes into the Dry Zone area of the Northern Province, drawing up plans to settle up to 30,000 Sinhalese in .\ncolonization schemes also took place in the areas of Ampara and Batticaloa districts where Sinhalese population rose from 61,996 in 1963 when the district was formed to 229,000 by 2007 according to Government census claims.\n\nThe notion of the \"traditional Tamil homeland\" became a potent component of popular Tamil\npolitical imagination while the Sinhalese nationalist groups viewed the resettlement schemes in these areas as \"reclamation and recreation in the present of the glorious Sinhalese Buddhist past\". The Muslim community tended to reject the countervailing notion of a traditional Tamil homeland in the North East region which resulted in animosity between the Muslim and Tamil communities in the region to rise \n\nThe first colonisation scheme was at Kanthalai Kulam (Kantale) tank where peasants from outside Trincomalee District were settled in the traditional Tamil village of Kanthalai, 39 km south-west of Trincomalee town. 77% of settlers were Sinhalese and the rest were Tamils/Muslims.\n\nA colonisation scheme was at Alai Kulam tank, 25 km south of Trincomalee town. 65% of settlers were Sinhalese and the rest were Muslims.\n\nThe colonisation scheme was extended to Tamil speaking areas of Anuradhapura District. A scheme was started at Pathavik Kulam (Padaviya) tank, 65 km north-east of Anuradhapura town. Parts of the scheme lay in Trincomalee District and as such were annexed to the Sinhalese dominated Anuradhapura District. Land Development Department employees from this scheme took part in the 1958 anti-Tamil riots.\n\nIn the 1961 a colonisation scheme was started at Muthali Kulam (Morawewa) tank, 24 km west of Trincomalee town.\n\nIn the 1980s, funded by aid received from the European Community, a colonisation scheme was started at Periya Vilankulam (Mahadiulwewa) tank, 30 km north-west of Trincomalee town.\n\nThe colonisation scheme was extended into the Northern province with the introduction of the Manal Aru (Weli Oya) scheme, which covered the districts of Mullaitivu, Trincomalee, Vavuniya and Anuradhapura. As ethnic Sinhalese farmers were settled in lands that were traditionally populated by ethnic tamils, given land, money to build homes and security provided by the Special Task Force. Although the scheme covered four districts, administration was handled from the Sinhalese dominated Anuradhapura district. The scheme aroused much anger amongst the Tamils. This anger boiled over into violence when the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam attacked the Kent and Dollar Farm settlement at Weli Oya, killing 62.\n\nWhen the Indian Peace Keeping Forces were withdrawn in 1990, Tamils homes in the suburbs of Trincomalee were occupied by Sinhalese settlers according to pro-rebel Tamilnet.Tens of thousands of landless Sinhala peasants were reported to have been brought in by the advancing SLF and made to occupy local villages and lands, denying resettlement to its original inhabitants who had earlier fled to the jungles due to the murder of Tamil civilians at the hands of the Army.\n\nSince the fall of the LTTE and the liberation of LTTE held areas several settlement programs were initiated by the government that extends towards the Northern Province.In the Vavuniya district 3000 acres in Madukulam is being cleared for a village while work of a settlement is underway in the former LTTE stronghold of Othiyamalai Kaadu a settlement is being created in Rampaveddi bordering the minor tank area of Eropothana and new settlement of approximately 2500 ethnic Sinhala families (about 6000 people) from the South were settled in the village of Kokkachaankulam and the Hindu temple in the village was demolished and replaced with a Buddhist Stupa. Tamils in Barathypuram were evicted and a Muslim settlement is being created in the area due to the large economic opportunities provided by an apparels factory being built there.\nSeveral new settlements are also being built in Mullaitivu District while the Weli Oya settlement is being expanded as well. Several fishing colonies are being built in the Mannar district and Muslim settlements have been built in lands previously owned by Tamils that fled to India during the war.\n‘Navatkuli Housing Project’ is being built in Navatkuli, Jaffna District to house 135 Sinhalese families, including 54 families who had, in 2010, attempted to set up temporary residences at the Jaffna Railway Station with funding from Buddhist Organizations and Political parties.\n\nTamil nationalist website TamilNet reported that Tamils were being ethnically cleansed in the Jaffna peninsula and Mullativu districts supplemented by construction of Buddhist stupas and Sinhalisation of names of streets and places. According to TamilNet the Tamil populace has reportedly been reduced to a fourth between 2007 and 2011 according to the Government enumeration.According to the website locals of both North and East complain of the state of waging an accelerated campaign of Sinhala Buddhist colonisation by destroying historic Hindu shrines in the East. Over 400 families were reported to have been settled in Nelukkulam in Mullativu district by the website. Another incident of state colonization before the Final Eelam War was reported by Muslim residents of Pulmoddai village who claimed that several acres of their traditional land had been annexed by the Government for settlements from South on the pretext of industrial development.\n\n"}

It is the only Main Committee of the General Assembly entitled to verbatim records.\n\nThe work of the Committee falls under seven thematic clusters: \n\nThe work of the Committee usually begins in late September and ends by the end of October or early November. The work of the body is split into three stages: (1) general debate, (2) thematic discussions and (3) action on drafts.\n\nDuring the first stage, the general debate, the Committee discusses its agenda items for around eight days. This period of debate is then followed by two weeks of thematic discussions on each of the seven clusters. During this stage, the body hears testimony from high-level officials in the field of arms control and disarmament. It also holds hearings in the form of interactive panel discussions with various representatives from disarmament entities. In the final stage, the body votes on any resolutions or decisions that it has drawn up during its session.\n\nThe Committee has two main bodies that report to it: the Disarmament Commission (UNDC) and the Conference on Disarmament (CD).\n\nThe Disarmament Commission meets yearly in New York for three weeks hosting both plenary meetings and working groups. The work of the Commission is usually divided between two working groups, with each group tackling one topic from the whole range of disarmament issues for that session, one of which must include nuclear disarmament. The Commission reports to the General Assembly via the First Committee at least once a year.\n\nWhile the Conference on Disarmament is not formally part of the United Nations machinery, it still reports to the General Assembly annually, or more frequently, as appropriate. Its budget is also included in that of the United Nations. The Conference meets in Geneva triannually and focuses on the following issues:\n\nThe Committee also hears reports from any expert groups established they establish.\n\nThe following make up the bureau of the First Committee for the 73rd Session of the General Assembly:\n\n\n"}

It subsequently came into wide use by politicians and activists opposed to mass immigration, intending criticism of Merkel's immigration policy.\n\nMerkel first used the phrase on 31 August 2015, at a press conference following a visit to a refugee camp near Dresden where local opponents of her open borders policy booed and heckled her. The full sentence she used was \"\"Wir haben so vieles geschafft – wir schaffen das.”\" This can be translated as \"We have managed so many things — we will also manage this situation.\"\n\nMerkel used the phrase against a background of violence and crime by and against immigrants in Germany., including the 2016 Munich shooting, the 2016 Ansbach bombing, and the Würzburg train attack.\n\nIn September 2016, Merkel stated that she would no longer be using the phrase. In an interview with the German paper, \"Wirtschaftswoche\", she said \"I sometimes think this phrase was a little overstated, that too much store was set by it — to the extent that I’d prefer not to repeat it\".\n\nTwo weeks after the press conference where Merkel first used the phrase, opponents began to use it to criticize her pro-immigration policy. In August 2018, one of the vice presidents of the German Bundestag, Wolfgang Kubicki (FDP), stated that the dictum was at the \"root of the violence\" in Chemnitz. SPD-chairwoman and SPD group leader in the Bundestag, Andrea Nahles, called this an \"unbelievable statement for an experienced politician\".\n\nWriting in \"The Atlantic\", Graeme Wood describes \"the anti-immigrant right\" as having \"hung 'Wir schaffen das' around (Merkel's) neck like a lead weight.\"\n\nOn 29 November 2018, CDU Secretary General Annegret Kramp-Karrenbauer, a candidate for succeeding Angela Merkel as CDU party chairwoman, used the phrase several times during a party conference, referring, not to asylum seekers but to family policies.\n"}
{"id": "32099418", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=32099418", "title": "Women in development", "text": "Women in development\n\nWomen in development is an approach of development projects that emerged in the 1969s, calling for treatment of women's issues in development projects. It is the integration of women into the global economies by improving their status and assisting in total development. Later, the Gender and development (GAD) approach proposed more emphasis on gender relations rather than seeing women's issues in isolation.\n\nIn Africa, one of the first to recognise the importance of women in farming was Hermann Baumann in 1928, with his classic article \"The Division of Work According to Sex in African Hoe Culture\". Kaberry published a much-quoted study of women in the Cameroon in 1952, and empirical data on male and female activities was documented in \"Nigerian Cocoa Farmers\" published in 1956 by Galletti, Baldwin and Dina.\nEster Boserup's pioneering \"Women's Role in Economic Development\" brought greater attention to the importance of women's role in agricultural economies and the lack of alignment of development projects with this reality.\nIn the preface to her book, Boserup wrote that \"in the vast and ever-growing literature on economic development, reflections on the particular problems of women are few and far between\".\nShe showed that women often did more than half the agricultural work, in one case as much as 80%, and that they also played an important role in trade.\n\nIn other countries, women were severely underemployed. According to the 1971 census in India, women constituted 48.2% of the population but only 13% of economic activity. Women were excluded from many types of formal job, so 94% of the female workforce was engaged in the unorganized sector employed in agriculture, agro-forestry, fishery, handicrafts and so on.\nWith growing awareness of women's issues, in the 1970s development planners began to try to integrate women better into their projects to make them more productive. \nThe WID approach initially accepted existing social structures in the recipient country and looked at how to better integrate women into existing development initiatives.\nThe straightforward goal was to increase the productivity and earnings of women.\n\nThe United Nations Development Program (UNDP) established a special Division for Women in Development, promoting concrete action to ensure that women participate in UNDP projects.\nThe United Nations paper \"International Development Strategy for the Third United Nations Development Decade\", issued in 1980, recognized a number of Women in Development issues. It called for women to play an active role in all sectors and at all levels of the Program of Action adopted by the World Conference of the United Nations Decade for Women, both as agents and beneficiaries. Policies on industrialization, food and agriculture, science and technology and social development should all involve women.\n\nA 1985 report by the OECD Development Center surveyed a broad sample of development projects aimed at women. It concluded that many were too welfare-oriented. It said \"future projects should avoid the home economics approach and focus on income-generating activities which are relevant and useful to the women participating\". It also noted the lack of information about women's roles and activities, and called for greater research as input to development projects.\n\nThe Harvard Analytical Framework attempted to address these concerns.\nThe framework has its origins in 1980 with a request to Harvard University for WID training from the World Bank. James Austin, who was well known for case-method training at Harvard, led a team with three women experienced in WID work: Catherine Overholt, Mary Anderson and Kathleen Cloud. These became known as the \"Harvard Team\".\nThe framework was elaborated by the Harvard Institute for International Development in collaboration with the WID office of USAID, and was first described in 1984 by Catherine Overholt and others. It was one of the earliest of such frameworks.\nThe starting point for the framework was the assumption that it makes economic sense for development aid projects to allocate resources to women as well as men, which will make development more efficient – a position named the \"efficiency approach\".\n\nIn November 1990 the leaders of the South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation (SAARC) countries endorsed recommendations of the second SAARC ministerial meeting of Women in Development held in June 1990, agreeing that the years 1991–2000 should be observed as the \"SAARC Decade of the Girl Child\". A wide range of recommendations for improving the development of female children were accepted.\n\nThe validity of the basic assumptions of the WID approach have been criticized by some, while other consider that it does not go far enough.\nThe latter group says it ignores the larger social processes that affect women's lives and their reproductive roles.\nThe approach does not address the root causes of gender inequalities.\nThe Gender and Development (GAD) approach in the 1980s attempted to redress the problem, using gender analysis to develop a broader view.\nThe approach is more concerned with relationships, the way in which men and women participate in development processes, rather than strictly focusing on women's issues.\n\nIn a 1988 paper \"Women in Development: Defining the Issues\" for the World Bank, Paul Collier argued that gender-neutral public policies may be inadequate, and gender-specific policies may be required to more effectively alleviate problems.\nIn at least some countries, women have become increasingly involved in financial budgeting and management and since the 1995 Beijing Conference on Women there has been a surge in gender-responsive budgeting.\n\nSources\n"}
{"id": "331452", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=331452", "title": "Yellow Peril", "text": "Yellow Peril\n\nThe Yellow Peril (also Yellow Terror and Yellow Spectre) is a racist color-metaphor that is integral to the xenophobic theory of colonialism: that the peoples of East Asia are a danger to the Western world. As a psycho-cultural perception of menace from the East, fear of the Yellow Peril was more racial than national, a fear derived, not from concern with a specific source of danger, from any one country or people, but from a vaguely ominous, existential fear of the vast, faceless, nameless horde of yellow people opposite the Western world. As a form of xenophobia, the Yellow Terror is the fear of the rising tide of colored people from the Orient.\n\nThe racist ideology of the Yellow Peril is a \"core imagery of apes, lesser men, primitives, children, madmen, and beings who possessed special powers\", which are cultural representations of colored people that originated in the Græco–Persian Wars (499–449 BC), between Ancient Greece and the Persian Empire; centuries later, Western imperialist expansion included East Asians to the Yellow Peril.\n\nIn the late 19th century, the Russian sociologist Jacques Novikow coined the phrase in his essay \"Le Péril Jaune\" (\"The Yellow Peril\", 1897); later, Kaiser Wilhelm II of Germany used Yellow Peril racism to encourage the European empires to invade, conquer, and colonize China. To that end, the Kaiser misrepresented the Asian victory in the Russo-Japanese War (1904–05) as a racialist threat to the white citizens of Western Europe, and misrepresented China and Japan in alliance to conquer and subjugate the Western world.\n\nThe sinologist Wing-Fai Leung explained the fantastic origins of the phrase and racialist ideology: \"The phrase yellow peril (sometimes yellow terror or yellow spectre) ... blends Western anxieties about sex, racist fears of the alien other, and the Spenglerian belief that the West will become outnumbered and enslaved by the East.\"\n\nThe academic Gina Marchetti identified the psycho-cultural fear of Asians as \"rooted in medieval fears of Genghis Khan and the Mongolian invasions of Europe, the Yellow Peril combines racist terror of alien cultures, sexual anxieties, and the belief that the West will be overpowered and enveloped, by the irresistible, dark, occult forces of the East\"; hence, in light of Japanese imperial militarism, the West included Japanese people to Yellow Peril racism.\n\nThe racist and cultural stereotypes of the Yellow Peril originated in the late 19th century, when Chinese workers (people of different skin-color, physiognomy, language and culture) legally immigrated to Australia, Canada, the U.S. and New Zealand, where they inadvertently provoked a racist backlash against themselves, for agreeing to work for lower wages, than the local white populations. In 1870, the French Orientalist and historian Ernest Renan had warned Europeans of Eastern danger to the West, yet Renan had meant the Russian Empire (1721–1917), a nation whom the West perceived as more Asiatic than European.\n\nSince 1870, in the practise of colonial imperialism, the stereotypes of Yellow Peril ideology gave concrete form to the anti-Asian racism that was cultural-currency in the Western worldview of Europe and North America. In central Europe, the Orientalist and diplomat Max von Brandt advised Kaiser Wilhelm II that Imperial Germany had colonial interests to pursue in China. Hence, the Kaiser used the phrase \"die Gelbe Gefahr\" (The Yellow Peril) to specifically encourage Imperial German interests and justify European colonialism in China.\n\nIn 1895, Germany, France, and Russia staged the Triple Intervention to the Treaty of Shimonoseki (17 April 1895), which concluded the First Sino-Japanese War (1894–1895), in order to compel Imperial Japan to surrender their Chinese colonies to the Europeans; that geopolitical gambit became an underlying \"casus belli\" of the Russo-Japanese War (1904–05). The Kaiser justified the Triple Intervention to the Japanese empire with racialist calls-to-arms against non-existent geopolitical dangers of the \"yellow race\" against the \"white race\" of Western Europe.\n\nTo justify European cultural hegemony, the Kaiser used the allegorical lithograph \"Peoples of Europe, Guard Your Most Sacred Possessions\" (1895), by Hermann Knackfuss, to communicate his geopolitics to other European monarchs. The lithograph depicts Germany as the leader of Europe, – collectively personified as \"prehistoric warrior-goddesses being led by the Archangel Michael against the 'yellow peril' from the East\" represented by \"dark cloud of smoke [upon] which rests an eerily calm Buddha, wreathed in flame\" (described by British historian James Palmer). Politically, the Knackfuss lithograph allowed Kaiser Wilhelm II to believe he prophesied the imminent race war that would decide global hegemony in the 20th century.\n\nIn the late 19th century, with the Treaty of Saint Petersburg (1881), the Qing dynasty (1644–1912) China recovered the eastern portion of the Ili River basin (Zhetysu), which Russia had occupied for a decade, since the Dungan Revolt (1862–77). In that time, the mass communications media of the West misrepresented China as an ascendant military power, and applied Yellow Peril ideology to evoke racist fears that China would conquer Western colonies, such as Australia.\n\nIn 1870s California, despite the Burlingame Treaty (1868) that allowed legal migration of unskilled labourers from China, the native working-class white people demanded that the U.S government cease the immigration of \"filthy yellow hordes\" of Chinese people who took jobs from native-born white-Americans, especially during an economic depression. In that vein, Horace Greeley, editor of the \"New-York Tribune\" newspaper, wrote a xenophobic and racist editorial opinion supporting the popularly demanded exclusion:\n\nIn Los Angeles, Yellow Peril racism provoked the Chinese Massacre of 1871, wherein 500 white men lynched 20 Chinese men in the Chinatown ghetto. Throughout the 1870s and 1880s, the leader of the Workingmen's Party of California, the Irish-born Denis Kearney was an extraordinary demagogue who successfully applied Yellow Peril ideology to his politics against the press, capitalists, politicians, and Chinese workers, and concluded his speeches with the epilogue: \"and whatever happens, the Chinese must go!\" Hence, by 1882, the political pressure of white xenophobia (nativist and populist) compelled the U.S. government to legislate the Chinese Exclusion Act (1882), which remained the effective immigration-law until 1943.\n\nIn 1900, the anti-colonial Boxer Rebellion (August 1899 – September 1901) reinforced the racist stereotypes of Asian people as a Yellow Peril to white people. The Society of the Righteous and Harmonious Fists (the Boxers) was a xenophobic martial-arts organization who blamed the problems of China on the presence of Western colonies in China proper. The Boxers sought to save China by killing every Western colonist and Chinese Christian – Westernized Chinese people. In early summer of 1900, Prince Zaiyi allowed the Boxers into Beijing, to kill Western colonists and Chinese Christians, in siege to the foreign legations. Afterwards, Ronglu, Qing Commander-in-Chief, and Yikuang, Prince Qing, resisted and expelled the Boxers from Beijing after days of fighting.\n\nMost of the victims of the Boxer Rebellion were Chinese Christians, but the massacres of Chinese people were of no interest to the West, who demanded Asian blood to avenge the Western colonists killed by rebellious Chinese natives. In response, Great Britain, the U.S., Imperial Japan, France, Imperial Russia, Imperial Germany, Austria–Hungary, and Italy formed the Eight-Nation Alliance, and despatched an international military expeditionary force to end the Siege of the International Legations in Beijing.\n\nIn the Russian press, Yellow Peril ideology misrepresented anti-colonial revolt (the Boxer Rebellion) in racialist and religious terms: A cultural war between White Holy Russia and Yellow Pagan China. The press further supported the Yellow Peril apocalypse with quotations from the Sinophobic poems of the philosopher Vladimir Solovyov. Likewise in the press, the aristocracy demanded action against the Asian threat; Prince Sergei Nikolaevich Trubetskoy urged Imperial Russia and other European monarchies to jointly partition China, and end the Yellow Peril to Christendom. Hence, on 3 July 1900, in response to the Boxer Rebellion, Russia expelled the Chinese community (5,000 people) from Blagoveshchensk; then, during the 4–8 July period, the Tsarist police, Cossack cavalry, and local vigilantes killed the expelled Chinese at the Amur River.\n\nIn the West, news of Boxer atrocities against Western colonists stirred anti-Asian racism in Europe and North America, where that anti-colonial revolt was mis-perceived as a race war, between the yellow race and the white race. Historically, Yellow Peril ideology recycles Boxer-Rebellion atrocities as false-proof that \"Boxerism\" (innate, murderous hatred of Westerners) is a Chinese cultural trait. In that vein, the article \"A Righteous Fist\" (\"The Economist\", 1905) warned the Western reader that: The history of the Boxer movement contains abundant warnings, as to the necessity of an attitude of constant vigilance, on the part of the European Powers, when there are any symptoms that a wave of nationalism is about to sweep over the Celestial Empire.\n\nHence, 61 years later, in 1967, during the Cultural Revolution, when the Red Guard attacked the British Embassy and beat diplomats, to the home country, the embassy staff explained the political violence as an outbreak of \"Boxerism\", which is an innate, cultural characteristic of the Chinese people.\n\nOn 27 July 1900, Kaiser Wilhelm II gave the racist \"Hunnenrede\" (Hun speech) exhorting his soldiers to barbarism; that Imperial German soldiers depart Europe for China and suppress the Boxer Rebellion, by acting like \"Huns\" and committing atrocities against the Chinese (Boxer and civilian):\n\nFearful of harm to the public image of Imperial Germany, the \"Auswärtiges Amt\" (Foreign Office) published a redacted version of the Hun Speech, expurgated of the exhortation to racist barbarism. Annoyed by Foreign-Office censorship, the Kaiser published the unexpurgated Hun Speech, which \"evoked images of a Crusade and considered the current crisis [the Boxer Rebellion] to amount to a war between Occident and Orient.\" Yet that \"elaborate accompanying music, and the new ideology of the Yellow Peril stood in no relation to the actual possibilities and results\" of geopolitical policy based upon racist misperception.\n\nThe Kaiser ordered the expedition-commander, Field Marshal Alfred von Waldersee, to behave barbarously, because the Chinese were, \"by nature, cowardly, like a dog, but also deceitful.\" In that time, the Kaiser's best friend, Prince Philip von Euenburg wrote to another friend that the Kaiser wanted to raze Beijing, and kill the populace to avenge the murder of Baron Clemens von Ketteler, Imperial Germany's minister to China. Only the Eight-Nation Alliance's refusal of barbarism to resolve the siege of the legations, saved the Chinese populace of Beijing from the massacre recommended by Imperial Germany. In August 1900, an international military-force of Russian, Japanese, British, French, and American soldiers captured Beijing, before the German force arrived to the city.\n\nThe Eight-Nation Alliance sacked Beijing in vengeance for the Boxer Rebellion; the magnitude of the rape, pillaging, and burning indicated \"a sense that the Chinese were less than human\" to the Western militaries. About the sacking of the city, an Australian colonist said: \"The future of the Chinese is a fearful problem. Look at the frightful sights one sees in the streets of Peking. . . . See the filthy, tattered rags they wrap around them. Smell them as they pass. Hear of their nameless immorality. Witness their shameless indecency, and picture them among your own people – Ugh! It makes you shudder!\"\n\nBritish admiral Roger Keyes recalled that: \"Every Chinaman . . . was treated as a Boxer, by the Russian and French troops, and the slaughter of men, women, and children in retaliation was revolting\". The American colonist Luella Miner reported that \"the conduct of the Russian soldiers is \"atrocious\", the French are not much better, and the Japanese are looting and burning without mercy. Women and girls, by the hundreds, have committed suicide to escape a worse fate at the hands of Russian and Japanese brutes.\"\n\nBritish soldiers threatened to kill a Chinese old man, unless he gave them his treasure. On learning he had no treasure, a rifleman prepared to bayonet the old man dead. That rifleman was stopped by another soldier, who told him: \"No, not that way! I'm going to shoot him. I've always had a longing to see what sort of wound a dum-dum [bullet] will make, and by Christ, I am going to try one on this blasted Chink!\" After shooting the Chinese old man in the face, the British soldier exclaimed: \"Christ, the dum-dum has blown the back out of his bloody nut!\" Moreover, the British journalist George Lynch said, \"there are things that I must not write, and that may not be printed in England, which would seem to show that this Western civilization of ours is merely a veneer over savagery\".\n\nThe German expedition of Field Marshal Waldersee arrived in China on 27 September 1900, after the military defeat of the Boxer Rebellion by the Eight Nation Alliance; yet he launched 75 punitive raids into northern China to search for and destroy the remaining Boxers. The punitive German soldiers killed more peasants than Boxer guerrillas, because, by autumn 1900, the Society of the Righteous and Harmonious Fists posed no threat, military or political. On 19 November 1900, the Kaiser's military gambit in China was criticized as shameful to Germany; in the \"Reichstag\", the German Social Democrat politician August Bebel criticized the imperial war against the Boxers:\n\nThe political praxis of Yellow Peril racism features a call for apolitical racial-unity among white people. To resolve a contemporary problem (economic, social, political) the racialist politician calls for white unity against the non-white Other who threatens from Asia. Despite their military defeat of the anti-colonial Boxer Rebellion, in the Western world, white racial-fear of Chinese nationalism became established as a cultural fear: That the Chinese race mean to invade, vanquish, and subjugate the Christian civilisation of the Western world.\n\nIn July 1900, the \"Völkisch\" movement intellectual Houston Stewart Chamberlain, the \"Evangelist of Race\", gave his racialist perspective of the cultural meaning of the Boer War (1899–1902) in relation to the Boxer Rebellion: \"One thing I can clearly see, that is, that it is criminal for Englishmen and Dutchmen to go on murdering each other, for all sorts of sophisticated reasons, while the Great Yellow Danger overshadows us white men, and threatens destruction.\"\n\nThe Yellow Peril racialism of the Austrian philosopher Christian von Ehrenfels (a founder of Gestalt psychology) proposed that the West and the East were in a Darwinian racial struggle for world domination, which the yellow race was winning. That monogamy was a legalistic hindrance to global white-supremacy, for limiting a genetically superior white man to father children with only one woman; that in polygamy, the yellow race had greater reproductive advantage, for permitting a genetically superior Asian man to father children with many women.\n\nEhrenfels dismissed the Chinese as a racially inferior people whose Oriental culture lacked \"all potentialities . . . determination, initiative, productivity, invention, and organizational talent\" innate to the white culture of the Western world. Contradictorily, despite having essentialized the Chinese into a listless mass of mindless Asians, Ehrenfels praised Japan as a first-rate military power, whose inevitable conquest of China would improve the racial breeds native to China. That through selective breeding with \"genetically superior\" Chinese women, the Japanese would create a race of \"healthy, sly, cunning coolies\", because the Chinese are virtuosos of sexual reproduction. The essence of Ehrenfels's nihilistic racism was that Asian conquest of the West equalled racial annihilation. Europe invaded, conquered, and subjugated by a Sino–Japanese army of genetically superior soldiers in a race war that the Western powers (imperial and democratic) would be unable to thwart or win.\n\nTo resolve the demographic imbalance between the East and the West, Ehrenfels proposed politically radical changes to the structures of European society, such as State control of human sexuality, by way of polygamy, which would ensure the procreation of a numerically and genetically superior nation of white people. Only white men of high economic and genetic status would legally be allowed to father children. Despite such radical changes to male sexual mores, women remained monogamous by law, culturally limited to the wife-and-mother social identity established in monogamous Christian patriarchy.\n\nIn Ehrenfels's polygamous patriarchy, women reside in communal barracks, where they collectively rear children. The State assigns each woman a husband for conjugal visits, solely for reproductive sexual-intercourse. The number of wives that a white man might have is determined by his socio-economic status, hence ensuring that only the \"social winners\" can transmit and perpetuate their genes. In such a white-supremacist society the man-and-woman relationship is reduced to the function of reproduction; romantic love is divorced from sexual intercourse in service to male white-supremacy.\n\nTo end the Yellow Peril, Ehrenfels proposed that the white nations of the world unite to conquer the nations of Asia, before it became infeasible, in order to create a new racial order for the world, which would feature an hereditary caste system headed by white people. Worldwide, an Aryan oligarchy (white people) would form and populate the ruling castes of the military and of the intelligentsia status-class, whilst the yellow-skin and the black-skin races would occupy the slave castes of their respective societies.\n\nEhrenfels believed that the racially pure society he proposed would be realised in the far-future, because \"the Aryan will only respond to the imperative of sexual reform when the waves of the Mongolian tide are lapping around his neck\". In light of the Japanese victory in the Russo-Japanese War in 1905, Ehrenfels said that such an Asian victory indicated \"the absolute necessity of a radical sexual reform for the continued existence of the Western races of man . . . [the matter] has been raised from the level of discussion to the level of a scientifically proven fact\".\n\nIn \"Sex, Masculinity, and the 'Yellow Peril': Christian von Ehrenfels' Program for a Revision of the European Sexual Order, 1902–1910\" (2002), the historian Edward Ross Dickinson said that Ehrenfels always used metaphors of deadly water to express his racism and fear of the Yellow Peril: A \"flood\" of Chinese upon the West; a Chinese \"torrent of mud\" drowning Europe; the Japanese as a \"polluting liquid\"; and that white Europeans would not respond to such a racial menace until the \"waves\" of Asians reached the neck.\n\nLikewise, the historian Klaus Theweleit said that, in the interwar period (1918–39), the political and racialist writings of the \"Freikorps\", right-wing mercenaries, featured imagery of deadly water, in a time when \"the Jews\" and the Communists were the only political and cultural threats to the worldview of right-wing Europeans. That the right-wing \"Freikorps\" were psychologically insecure men obsessed with masculinity, and with proving themselves hard men; the negative imagery of water they used, reflected fears of the physical softness of women; of the erotic; of love and emotional intimacy; and of human dependence – things that psychologically threatened to render them less manly.\n\nMoreover, Dickinson said that a man like Baron Christian von Ehrenfels likely suffered the same sexual anxieties about masculinity, as did the right-wing writers, whose works Theweleit examined, but that only Ehrenfels projected his sexual insecurity into Yellow Peril racism, rather than the usual anti-Semitic myth of Judeo-Bolshevism, which is a racist prejudice more common to German culture.\n\nFrom 1895, the Kaiser's government used Yellow Peril ideology to portray Imperial Germany as defender of the West against conquest from the East. In pursuit of \"Weltpolitik\", the world policy to establish Germany as the dominant world power, the Kaiser manipulated public opinion, the government and other monarchs. In a letter to Tsar Nicholas II of Russia, Kaiser Wilhem II wrote: \"It is clearly the great task of the future for Russia to cultivate the Asian continent, and defend Europe from the inroads of the Great Yellow Race\". In \"The Bloody White Baron\" (2009), the historian James Palmer explains the sociocultural background of 19th-century Europe in which Yellow Peril ideology originated and flourished:\n\nAs his cousin, Kaiser Wilhelm knew that Tsar Nicholas shared his anti-Asian racism and believed he could persuade the Tsar to abrogate the Franco-Russian Alliance (1894) and then to form a German–Russian alliance against Britain. In manipulative pursuit of Imperial German \"Weltpolitik\" \"Wilhelm II's deliberate use of the 'yellow peril' slogan was more than a personal idiosyncrasy, and fitted into the general pattern of German foreign policy under his reign, i.e. to encourage Russia's Far Eastern adventures, and later to sow discord, between the United States and Japan. Not the substance, but only the form, of Wilhelm II's 'yellow peril' propaganda disturbed the official policy of the Wilhelmstrasse.\"\n\nIn the 19th century, the racial and cultural stereotypes of Yellow Peril ideology colored German perceptions of Russia as a nation more Asiatic that European. The European folk memory of the 13th-century Mongol invasion of Europe made the word \"Mongol\" a cultural synonym for the \"Asian culture of cruelty and insatiable appetite for conquest\", which was especially personified by Genghis Khan, leader of the Orda, the Mongol Horde.\n\nDespite that justifying historical background, Yellow Peril racism was not universally accepted in the societies of Europe. French intellectual Anatole France said that Yellow Peril ideology was to be expected from a racist man such as the Kaiser. Inverting the racist premise of Asian invasion, France showed that European imperialism in Asia and Africa indicated that the European White Peril was the true threat to the world. In his essay \"The Bogey of the Yellow Peril\" (1904), the British journalist Demetrius Charles Boulger said the Yellow Peril was racist hysteria for popular consumption. Asian geopolitical dominance of the world is \"the prospect, placed before the uninstructed reading public, is a revival of the Hun and Mongol terrors, and the names of Attila and Genghis are set out in the largest type to create feelings of apprehension. The reader is assured, in the most positive manner, that this is the doing of the enterprising nation of Japan\". Throughout the successful imperial intrigues facilitated by Germany's Yellow Peril ideology, the Kaiser's true geopolitical target was Britain.\n\nIn 18th-century Britain, the Chinese were considered a civilised people, but British imperial expansion in the 19th century facilitated racialist hostility towards Asians. The Chinese people were stereotyped as an inherently-depraved and corrupt people. Still, there were exceptions to popular racism of the Yellow Peril. In May 1890, William Ewart Gladstone criticized anti–Chinese immigration laws in Australia for penalizing their hard worker virtues (diligence, thrift and integrity), instead of penalizing their vices (gambling and opium-smoking).\n\nIn 1904, in a meeting about the Russian–Japanese War, King Edward VII heard the Kaiser complain that the Yellow Peril is \"the greatest peril menacing... Christendom and European civilisation. If the Russians went on giving ground, the yellow race would, in twenty years time, be in Moscow and Posen\". Undiplomatically, the Kaiser criticised the British for siding with Japan against Russia, suggesting \"race treason\" as a motive. In reply to the Kaiser, King Edward said he \"could not see it. The Japanese were an intelligent, brave and chivalrous nation, quite as civilised as the Europeans, from whom they only differed by the pigmentation of their skin\".\nThe first British usage of the Yellow Peril phrase was in the \"Daily News\" (21 July 1900) report describing the Boxer Rebellion as \"the yellow peril in its most serious form\". Then, the racism of British Sinophobia, the fear of Chinese people, did not include all Asians since Britain had sided with Japan during the Russian–Japanese War, but France and Germany supported Russia. The reports of one British military observer, Captain William Pakenham \"tended to depict Russia as his enemy, not just Japan\".\n\nAbout pervasive Sinophobia in Western culture, in \"The Yellow Peril: Dr Fu Manchu & the Rise of Chinaphobia\" (2014), historian Julia Lovell noted:\n\nIn the British popular imagination, the Limehouse district of London was a centre of depravity and vice, sexual prostitution, opium smoking and gambling. The press warned of the dangers of miscegenation of Chinese men marrying British women as a racial threat to Britain, and it warned that Triad gangsters kidnapped British women into white slavery, \"a fate worse than death\" in Western popular culture. In 1914, at the start of the First World War, the Defence of the Realm Act was amended to include the smoking of opium as grounds for deportation. In fact, that was a legalistic pretext for expelling the Chinese inhabitants of London from Britain proper. That anti–Chinese moral panic derived from the social reality that British women had acquired economic independence with war effort jobs and would engage in premarital sexual affairs, a cultural threat that offended Britain's conservative society. Such racist fears of the Yellow Peril were European cultural prejudices projected onto the Chinese community of Britain for allegedly corrupting British women into premarital libertinism.\n\nIn the US, Yellow Peril xenophobia was legalized with the Page Act of 1875, the Chinese Exclusion Act of 1882, and the Geary Act of 1892. The Chinese Exclusion Act replaced the Burlingame Treaty (1868), which had encouraged Chinese migration to the US and provided that \"citizens of the United States in China, of every religious persuasion, and Chinese subjects, in the United States, shall enjoy entire liberty of conscience, and shall be exempt from all disability or persecution, on account of their religious faith or worship, in either country\", withholding only the right of naturalized citizenship.\n\nIn the Western US, the regular cultural lynching Chinese people yielded the coinage of a phrase, \"Having a Chinaman's chance in Hell\", meaning no chance at all. In 1880 Denver, the Yellow Peril pogrom featured a lynched Chinese man and destruction of the local Chinatown. In 1885, the Rock Springs massacre of 28 miners destroyed a Wyoming Chinese community. In Washington Territory, Yellow Peril fears realised the Attack on Squak Valley Chinese laborers, 1885; the arson of the Seattle Chinatown; and the Tacoma riot of 1885 by which local white folk expelled the Chinese community from their towns. In Seattle, the Knights of Labor expelled 200 Chinese people by the Seattle riot of 1886. In Oregon, 34 Chinese gold miners were ambushed, robbed and killed in the Hells Canyon Massacre (1887). Moreover, about being Chinese in the 19th-century US, in the essay \"A Chinese View of the Statue of Liberty\" (1885), Sauum Song Bo said,:\n\nUnder nativist political pressure, the Immigration Act of 1917 established an Asian Barred Zone of countries from which immigration to the US was forbidden. The Cable Act of 1922, or the Married Women's Independent Nationality Act, guaranteed citizenship to independent woman unless they married to an alien ineligible to naturalization. During the 1920s, when the Cable Act of 1922 was law, Asian men and women were excluded from American citizenship. In practice, the Cable Act of 1922 reversed some racial exclusion laws and granted independent-woman citizenship exclusively to women married to white men. Analogously, the Act allowed revocation of the US citizenship of a white woman married an Asian man. Nonetheless, legalized Yellow Peril racism was challenged; in the Supreme Court case of \"Takao Ozawa v. United States\" (1922), a Japanese–American man tried to demonstrate that the Japanese are a white race eligible for naturalized US citizenship, but the Court ruled that the Japanese are not white people. Two years later, the National Origins Quota of 1924 specifically excluded the Japanese from the country and citizenship.\n\nTo \"preserve the ideal of American homogeneity\", the Emergency Quota Act of 1921 (numeric limits) and the Immigration Act of 1924 (fewer Southern and Eastern Europeans) restricted admission according to immigrants' national origins. In practice, the Emergency Quota Act used an old census to determine the number of colored immigrants to admit to the US. Still, to protect the ethnic supremacy (social, economic and political) of the White Anglo-Saxon Protestant (WASP) community, the Immigration Act of 1924 used the census of 1890 (two decades old) because its 19th-century demographic-group percentages favoured more admissions of WASP immigrants and fewer admissions of colored immigrants from Asia, Eastern Europe and Southern Europe.\n\nThe National Origins Formula (1921–1965) was meant to maintain the \"status quo\" percentages of colored ethnic populations in proportion to their existing populations. The National Origins Formula was to ensure that the immigration of colored peoples did not change the WASP national character of the US. To that end, the National Origins Formula allowed only 150,000 colored people to immigrate the US per year. Specifically inclining Latin Americans and excluding Asians, the law used Yellow Peril racism, which was institutionally inherent to US immigration law. It was much later that the Immigration and Nationality Act of 1965 that repealed the racial quota systems.\n\nEugenics-supporters used the Yellow Peril to present the US as a WASP nation with an ethnically-pure country under threat of miscegenation by Asian immigration. They expressed with biological language (infection, disease, decay) and imagery of bodily penetration (wounds and sores) by the nonwhite Asian Other.\n\nIn \"The Yellow Peril; or, Orient vs. Occident\" (1911), the end time evangelist G. G. Rupert, said that Russia would unite the colored races to facilitate the Oriental invasion, conquest and subjugation of the West. That was derived from the Christian eschatology of the Book of Revelation in verse 16:12: \"Then the sixth angel poured out his bowl on the great Euphrates River, and it dried up so that the kings from the east could march their armies toward the west without hindrance\". Moreover, as an Old-Testament Christian, Rupert believed in the racialist doctrine of British Israelism and said that the Yellow Peril from China, India, Japan and Korea, were attacking Britain and the US but that Jesus would halt their conquest of the Western world.\n\nIn \"The Rising Tide of Color Against White World-Supremacy\" (1920), the eugenicist Lothrop Stoddard, said that either China or Japan would unite the colored peoples of Asia and lead them to destroy the white world of the West and that the colored conquest of the world began with the Asian victory in the Russian–Japanese War (1905). As a white supremacist, Stoddard presented his racialist theories with biblical vocabulary and catastrophic imagery depicting a rising tide of \"non-white\" people who mean to invade, conquer and subjugate the white race.\n\nIn that cultural vein, the phrase was commonly used editorially in the newspapers of publisher William Randolph Hearst. In the 1930s, Hearst newspapers realised a campaign of vilification (political and personal) against the American communist activist Elaine Black, whom he denounced as libertine \"Tiger Woman\" for openly cohabiting with Karl Yoneda, an Asian man and a communist. In 1931 California, interracial marriage was outlawed and so they could not marry, but in 1935, Black and Yoneda married in Seattle, Washington, a city and a state that did not proscribe interracial marriage. The vilification of Elaine Black was about miscegenation, not communist politics. Publisher Hearst's business acumen saw that reporting the socially-scandalous private life of a politically-active American white woman in an interracial relationship with an Asian man would sell more newspapers.\n\nIn the 1930s, Yellow Peril stereotypes were common to US culture, exemplified by the cinematic versions of the Asian detectives Charlie Chan (Warner Oland) and Mr. Moto (Peter Lorre), originally literary detectives in novels and comic strips. White actors portrayed the Asian men and made the fictional characters socially acceptable in mainstream American cinema, especially when the villains were secret agents of Imperial Japan.\n\nNotable American proponents of the Japanese Yellow Peril were the military-industrial interests of the China Lobby (right-wing intellectuals, businessmen, Christian missionaries) who were political advocates for the warlord \"Generalíssimo\" Chiang Kai-shek, whom they represented as the (Methodist-convert) Christian-Chinese saviour of China, then in the middle of civil war. After the Japanese invaded China in 1937, the China Lobby successfully pressured the politically neutral US government to aid the China of Chiang Kai-shek. The media coverage (print, radio and cinema) of the Second Sino-Japanese War (1937–45) favoured China, which politically facilitated the American financing and equipping of the anticommunist Kuomintang, the Chiang Kai-shek faction in the Chinese Civil War (1927–1937, 1946–1950), which also featured the Communist Mao Zedong.\n\nIn 1941, after the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor, the Roosevelt administration formally declared China an ally of the US. In political compliance with the government, the American media then modified the use of Yellow Peril ideology and criticised contemporary anti-Chinese laws as counterproductive to the war effort against Imperial Japan. The wartime \"zeitgeist\" and the geopolitics of the US government presumed that defeat of the Japanese Empire would be followed by post-war China developing into a major capitalist economy, under the strongman leadership of the Christian \"Generalíssimo\" Chiang Kai-shek and the Kuomintang (Chinese Nationalist Party).\n\nHowever, in the course of his political and personal relations with the US government, and his China Lobby sponsors, Chiang requested the repeal of American anti-Chinese laws and to achieve the repeals, threatened to exclude the American business community from the \"China Market\", the economic fantasy that the China Lobby promised to the military and industrial interests of the US. In 1943, the US government repealed the Chinese Exclusion Act of 1882, but because the National Origins Act of 1924 was contemporary law, the repeal was a symbolic gesture of American solidarity with the people of China.\n\nScience fiction writer William F. Wu, said that American adventure, crime, and detective pulp magazines in the 1930s had many Yellow Peril characters, loosely based on Fu Manchu, and that although \"most [Yellow Peril characters] were of Chinese descent\", the Asian geopolitics of the time led people to see Japan as a threat to the United States. In his book \"The Yellow Peril: Chinese Americans in American fiction, 1850–1940\" (1982), Wu said that fear of Asians dates from the European Middle Ages during the 13th-century Mongol invasion of Europe. Most Europeans had never seen an Asian man or woman, and the great differences in language, custom and physique accounted for European paranoia about the nonwhite peoples from the Eastern world.\n\nIn the late 19th century, Australians desiring a proper country and a white society, feared the Yellow Peril for possession of the continent. The racialist fear of the non-white Asian Other was a thematic preoccupation common to invasion literature novels like \"The Yellow Wave: A Romance of the Asiatic Invasion of Australia\" (1895), \"The Coloured Conquest\" (1904), \"The Awakening to China\" (1909), \"Fools' Harvest\" (1939). They usually featured an Asian invasion of the \"empty north\" of Australia, which was really populated by the Aboriginal Australians, the native non-white Other. In the novel \"White or Yellow?: A Story of the Race War of A.D. 1908\" (1887), William Lane, a journalist and labour leader, believed that a horde of Chinese people legally arrived to Australia overran white society and monopolized the industries important to exploiting the natural resources of the \"empty north\" of Australia.\n\nAs Australian invasion literature, \"White or Yellow?\" reflects Lane's nationalist racialism and left-wing politics in a future history of Australia under attack by the Yellow Peril. In the near future, British capitalists manipulate the legal system and successfully arrange the mass immigration of Chinese workers to Australia, regardless of the socioeconomic consequences to Australian common folk and their society. The economic, cultural, and sexual conflicts that resulted from the capitalists' manipulation of the economy provoke a white-yellow race war throughout Australia. The racialist representations of Yellow Peril ideology in the narrative of \"White or Yellow?\" justify white Australians' killing the Chinese workers as an existential response for physical and economic control of Australia. Moreover, the leaders of the labour and trade unions greatly opposed the importation of Chinese workers, whom they portrayed as an economic (low-wage) threat to Australia, and as a moral threat (libertinism) to Christian civilization, which addresses the psychosexual theme of miscegenation (mixing of the races), which is an apolitical call to racial unity among white Australians.\n\nCulturally, Asian-invasion novels expressed the white man's sexual fear of voracious Asian sexuality with scenes of a white woman in sexual peril, usually rape or seduction, aided by the sensual and moral release of opium. A white woman who was raped or seduced by a Chinese man had suffered \"a fate worse than death\". Thus defiled, the woman is a sexual untouchable to other white men. In that moralistic vein, in the 1890s, labour activist and feminist Rose Summerfield voiced the white female sexual fear of the Yellow Peril by warning society of the unnatural lust in the eyes of Chinese men when they looked upon the pulchritude of the white women of Australia.\n\nIn 1901, the Australian federal government adopted the White Australia policies, initiated with the Immigration Restriction Act 1901, which generally excluded Asian peoples, especially the Chinese and the Melanesians. Historian C.E.W. Bean said that Australian racialist exclusion was \"a vehement effort to maintain a high, Western standard of economy, society, and culture (necessitating, at that stage, however it might be camouflaged, the rigid exclusion of Oriental peoples).\" In 1913, the film, \"Australia Calls\" (1913) depicted an invasion of Australia by \"Mongolians\" defeated by ordinary Australians with resistance and guerrilla warfare.\n\nIn 1919, at the Paris Peace Conference (28 June 1919), supported by Britain and the US, the Australian Prime Minister, Billy Hughes, vehemently opposed Imperial Japan's recommendation for the inclusion of the Racial Equality Proposal in Article 21 of the Covenant of the League of Nations on 13 February 1919:\n\nAware that Britain opposed the formal inclusion of the clause to Article 21 of the Covenant, the conference chairman, US President Woodrow Wilson, prevented \"de jure\" racial equality among the nations of the world by unilaterally requiring a unanimous vote by the participant countries. On 11 April 1919, most countries in the conference voted to include a universal clause for racial equality Article 21 of the Covenant of the League of Nations, opposed only by Britain and the US. Moreover, to maintain the White Australian policy, the Australian government sided with Britain in the vote against Japan's clause for racial equality, a defeat in international relations that greatly influenced Imperial Japan to turn from co-operation to confrontation with the West.\n\nIn 1890s France, the \"Péril jaune\" (Yellow Peril) was invoked in negative comparisons of the low French birth rate of the French and the high Asian birth rate. Accordingly, there was the cultural fear that one day Asians would \"flood\" France, which could be successfully countered only by increased fecundity of French women. Then, France would possess enough soldiers to thwart the eventual flood of immigrants from Asia. From that racialist perspective, the French press sided with Imperial Russia during the Russo-Japanese War (1904–1905) and represented the Russians as heroically defending the white race against the Japanese Yellow Peril.\n\nIn 1904, the French journalist René Pinon reported the cultural, geopolitical and existential threat to white civilisation in the West:\nDespite the Christian idealism of the civilizing mission, from the start of colonialisation in 1858, the French exploited the land of Vietnam as inexhaustible and the Vietnamese people as beasts of burden. During the First Indochina War, (1946–1954) the French justified their colonial return of Vietnam as defense of the white West against the \"péril jaune\" – specifically the Communist Party of Vietnam, as puppets of Red China in the communist conspiracy to conquer the world. Hence, French orientalism defined the Asian Other as less than human, combined with anticommunism, which dehumanisation allowed atrocities against Viet Minh prisoners of war, during \"la sale guerre\", the dirty war against international communism. The Yellow Peril metaphors in French anti-communist media portrayed the Viet Minh as part of the \"innombrables masses jaunes\" (innumerable yellow hordes) and one of many \"vagues hurlantes\" (roaring waves) of \"masses fanatisées\" (fanatical hordes).\n\nIn \"Behind the Bamboo Hedge: The Impact of Homeland Politics in the Parisian Vietnamese Community\" (1991), Gisèle Luce Bousquet, said that the \"péril jaune\", which traditionally colours French perceptions of Asians, especially of the Vietnamese, remains a cultural prejudice of contemporary France. Hence, the Vietnamese people in France are perceived and resented as academic overachievers who take jobs from \"native French\" people.\n\nIn 2015, the front cover of the January issue of \"Fluide Glacial\" magazine featured a cartoon, \"Yellow Peril: Is it Already Too Late?\", which depicts a Chinese-occupied Paris where a sad Frenchman pulling a rickshaw, with a Chinese passenger (dressed as a 19th c. French colonial official) accompanied by a barely-dressed, blonde French woman. The editor of \"Fluide Glacial\", Yan Lindingre defended the cover and the subject as satire and mockery of French fears of China's economic threat to France. In an editorial directed to the complaining Chinese, Lindingre said, \"I have just ordered an extra billion copies printed, and will send them to you via a chartered flight. This will help us balance our trade deficit and give you a good laugh\".\n\nIn the 20th century, from their perspective, as non-white nations in a world order dominated by the white nations, the geopolitics of Ethiopia–Japan relations allowed Imperial Japan and Ethiopia to avoid European imperial colonisation of their countries and nations. Before the Second Italo-Ethiopian War (1934–1936), Imperial Japan had given diplomatic and military support to Ethiopia against invasion by the Fascist Italy, which implied military assistance. In response to that Asian anti-imperialism, Benito Mussolini ordered a Yellow Peril propaganda campaign by the Italian press, which represented Imperial Japan as the military, cultural, and existential threat to the Western world, by way of the dangerous \"yellow race–black race\" alliance meant to unite Asians and Africans against the white people of the world.\n\nIn 1935, Mussolini warned of the Japanese Yellow Peril, specifically the racial threat of Asia and Africa uniting against Europe. In the summer of 1935, the National Fascist Party (1922–43) often staged anti–Japanese political protests throughout Italy. Nonetheless, as right-wing imperial powers, Japan and Italy pragmatically agreed to disagree; in exchange for Italian diplomatic recognition of Manchukuo (1932–45), the Japanese puppet state in China, Imperial Japan would not aid Ethiopia against Italian invasion and so Italy would end the anti–Japanese Yellow Peril propaganda in the national press of Italy.\n\nDuring the Mexican Revolution (1910–20), Chinese-Mexicans were subjected to racist abuse, like before the revolt, for not being Christians, specifically Roman Catholic, for not being racially Mexican, and for not soldiering and fighting in the Revolution against the thirty-five-year dictatorship (1876–1911) of General Porfirio Díaz.\n\nThe notable atrocity against the Yellow Peril was the three-day Torreón massacre (13–15 May 1911) in northern Mexico, wherein the military forces of Francisco I. Madero killed 308 Asian people (303 Chinese, 5 Japanese), because they were deemed a cultural threat to the Mexican way of life. The massacre of Chinese- and Japanese-Mexicans at the city of Torreón, Coahulia State, was not the only such atrocity perpetrated in the Revolution. Elsewhere, in 1913, after the Constitutional Army captured the city of Tamasopo, San Luis Potosí state, the soldiers and the town-folk expelled the Yellow Peril from town by sacking and burning the Chinatown.\n\nDuring and after the Mexican Revolution, the Roman Catholic prejudices of Yellow Peril ideology facilitated racial discrimination and violence against Chinese Mexicans, usually for \"stealing jobs\" from native Mexicans, etc. Anti–Chinese, nativist propaganda misrepresented the Chinese people as unhygienic, prone to immorality (miscegenation, gambling, opium-smoking) and spreading diseases that would biologically corrupt and degenerate \"La Raza\" (the Mexican race) and generally undermining the Mexican patriarchy.\n\nMoreover, from the racialist perspective, besides stealing work from Mexican men, Chinese men were stealing Mexican women from the native Mexican men who were away fighting the Revolution, overthrowing and expelling the dictator Porfirio Díaz and his foreign sponsors from Mexico. In the 1930s, approximately 70% of the Chinese and the Chinese–Mexican population was expelled from the Mexican United States by the bureaucratic ethnic culling of the Mexican population.\n\nIn 1908, after the Young Turk Revolution, the Committee of Union and Progress (CUP) achieved political dominance, reinforced, five years later, after the Raid on the Sublime Porte in 1913. The CuP greatly admired the Japanese for modernising their country while retaining its \"Eastern spiritual essence\", and it proclaimed its intention to transform the Ottoman Empire into the \"Japan of the Near East\".\n\nIn an inversion of the Yellow Peril racism of the Western world, the Young Turks thought of entering an alliance with Imperial Japan that would unite all the peoples of \"the East\" to wage a war of extermination against the much-hated Western nations whose empires dominated the world. Culturally, for the Young Turks, the term \"yellow\" symbolised the \"Eastern gold\" colour that represents the innate moral superiority of the Eastern world over the corrupt, materialistic West.\n\nFrom 1904 to 1910, the Unionist Government of the Britain authorised the immigration to South Africa of approximately 63,000 Chinese labourers to work the gold mines in the Witwatersrand basin after the conclusion of the Second Boer War. After 1910, most Chinese miners were repatriated to China because of the great opposition to them, as \"coloured people\", in the white society of South Africa, much like the anti–Chinese laws in the US during the early 20th century.\n\nThe mass immigration of indentured Chinese labourers to mine South African gold for wages lower than acceptable to the native white men, contributed to the electoral loss of the financially-conservative British Unionist government that then governed South Africa.\n\nOn 26 March 1904, approximately 80,000 people attended the social-protest demonstration against the use of Chinese labourers in the Transvaal was held in Hyde Park, London, to publicise the exploitation of Chinese South Africans. The Parliamentary Committee of the Trade Union Congress then passed a resolution declaring:\n\nIn the event, despite the racial violence between white South African miners and Chinese miners, the Unionist government achieved the economic recovery of South Africa after the Anglo–Boer War by making the gold mines of the Witwatersrand Basin the most productive in the world.\n\nIn recent years, there have been very strong anti-Chinese feelings in Turkey owing to allegations of human rights abuses against the Muslim Turkic Uighur people in China's Xinjiang province. At one anti-Chinese demonstration in Istanbul, a South Korean tourist was threatened with violence even she protested that \"I am not Chinese, I am Korean\". In response, Devlet Bahçeli, leader of the extreme right-wing Nationalist Movement Party stated: \"How does one distinguish between Chinese and Koreans? Both have slanted eyes\".\n\nIn the late 19th and the early 20th centuries, populist Prime Minister Richard Seddon compared the Chinese people to monkeys, and so used the Yellow Peril to promote racialist politics in New Zealand. In 1879, in his first political speech, Seddon said that New Zealand did not wish her shores \"deluged with Asiatic Tartars. I would sooner address white men than these Chinese. You can't talk to them, you can't reason with them. All you can get from them is 'No savvy'\".\n\nMoreover, in 1905, in the city of Wellington, the fanatical white supremacist Lionel Terry murdered Joe Kum Yung, an old Chinese man, in protest against Asian immigration to New Zealand. Laws promulgated to limit Chinese immigration included a heavy poll tax, introduced in 1881 and lowered in 1937, after Imperial Japan's invasion and occupation of China. In 1944, the poll tax was abolished, and the New Zealand government formally apologised to the Chinese populace of New Zealand.\n\nThe core of Yellow Peril ideology is the white man's fear of Oriental sexual voracity; of the Seducer and the Seductress (Dragon Lady and Lotus Blossom) who possess an unnatural and perverse sex appeal that is a moral and a mortal threat to the white civilisation of the Christian West. Racist revulsion towards miscegenation – interracial sexual intercourse – communicated with sexual stereotypes of the Yellow Peril, derives from the fear of mixed-race children, whose existence threatens Whiteness proper.\n\nThe seductive Asian man (wealthy and cultured) was the more common form of white-male fear of the Asian sexual Other. In the Asian seducer, the sexual threat of the Yellow Peril was realised with successful sexual competition – seduction or rape – which irredeemably corrupted the white woman, beyond redemption. (see: \"55 Days at Peking\", 1963) The American critic Gary Hoppenstand identified interracial sexual-intercourse as a threat to the culture of whiteness:\n\nIn \"The Cheat\" (1915), the wealthy Hishuru Tori (Sessue Hayakawa) is a Japanese sexual predator and sadist whose attentions menace Edith Hardy (Fannie Ward), an American housewife. Although superficially Westernized, Tori is a rapist, which reflects his true cultural identity as an Asian man. In being \"brutal and cultivated, wealthy and base, cultured and barbaric, Tori embodies the contradictory qualities Americans associate with Japan\". Initially, the story presents Tori as an \"asexual\" man associating with the high society of Long Island; yet, once Edith is in his private study, decorated with Japanese art, he is a man of \"brooding, implicitly sadistic sexuality\". At times, before Tori attempts to rape Edith, the narrative of the story implies that she is attracted to him and corresponds his sexual interest in her. To assure commercial success, the cast of \"The Cheat\" (1915) featured the Japanese actor Sessue Hayakawa – who was a male sex symbol in the cinema of that time – which was a cultural fact that resonated on-screen and off-screen as a sexual threat to the existing racial hierarchy and sexual mores of white men in 1915.\n\nIn \"Shanghai Express\" (1932), General Henry Chang (Warner Oland) is a warlord of Eurasian origin (Chinese and American), whom the narrative presents as an asexual man, which excludes him from the realm of Western sexual mores and the racialist order; thus, he is dangerous to the Westerners he holds hostage. Though Chang is Eurasian, he is prouder of his Chinese heritage, and rejects his American heritage, which rejection confirms his Oriental identity.\n\nIn 1931, the Chinese civil war has rendered the country into a version of Hell, which a diverse group of Westerners must traverse by train, from Beijing to Shanghai, a voyage that turns for the worse when General Chang's soldiers hijack the train. The story implies that Gen. Chang is a bisexual man who desires to rape the heroine, Shanghai Lily (Marlene Dietrich), and the hero, Captain Donald \"Doc\" Harvey (Clive Brook).\n\nMoreover, when the German opium smuggler Erich Baum (Gustav von Seyffertitz) insults Chang, the warlord symbolically rapes him by branding; the sadistic Chang derives sexual pleasure in branding Baum with a red-hot poker. After being branded, the once proud Baum becomes notably cowed and submissive to Chang, then owns him in realisation of the ultimate fear of the Yellow Peril: Westerners enslaved to the unnatural and perverse sexuality of the East; later, Chang rapes Hui Fei (Anna May Wong).\n\nGen. Chang's desire to blind Capt. Harvey also is a castration metaphor, a taboo subject even for the intellectually permissive Production code in effect in 1932. In marked contrast to Chang's bisexuality and his \"almost effeminate polish\", the British Army Captain Harvey is a resolutely heterosexual man, a tough, rugged soldier tested and proved in the trenches of the First World War (1914–18); the Briton is a model of Western masculinity and strength. Throughout, the narrative implies that Shanghai Lily and Hui Fei are in a lesbian relationship, thus, at story's end, Lily's choice of Capt. Harvey as her lover, reaffirms the heterosexual appeal of the Western man and redeems her from prostitution.\n\nThe narrative of \"Shanghai Express\" embraces the stereotypes of the Yellow Peril through the Eurasian character of Gen. Chang, and also undermines their inhumanity through the suffering of Hui Fei, who cries inconsolably after Chang raped her, such humanity allows the audience to sympathize with a non-white Other. As a courtesan, Hui Fei is condescended to by every Western character, except her best friend Lily, because of her race and profession, but is shown as dignified woman who stands up for herself. At the climax, Hui Fei kills Gen. Chang to save Harvey from being blinded by him; she explains that killing Chang regained the self-respect he had taken from her. Throughout, the narrative has suggested that Shanghai Lily and Hui Fei are more attracted to each other than to Capt. Harvey. That detail of character, which suggests that Hui Fei is sexually abnormal, was socially daring drama in 1932, because Western mores considered bi-sexuality to be unnatural. The same criticism of sexual orientation might apply to Lily, but the story concludes with resumed heterosexuality, when she kisses Capt. Harvey, while Hui Fei walks away alone, sad for having been raped and for losing her best friend to Capt. Harvey.\n\nThe Dragon Lady is a cultural representation of white fear of Asian female sexuality. The Asian seductress is a charming, beautiful, and sexually insatiable woman who readily and easily dominates men. As a sexual Other, the dragon-lady woman is a tempting, but morally degrading object of desire for the white man.\n\nIn Western cinema genre, the cowboy town features an Asian woman who usually portrayed as a scheming prostitute, always seeking to use her sexuality (charisma and physical sex-appeal) to beguile and dominate the white man. In the American television program Ally McBeal (1997–2002), the Yellow Peril featured the Dragon Lady stereotype, personified as the Ling Woo character, a domineering woman whose Chinese ethnicity includes sexual abilities that no white woman could hope to match.\n\nIn the late 20th century, such a sexual representation of the Yellow Peril, introduced in the comic strip \"Terry and the Pirates\" (27 September 1936), indicates that the Western imagination continues to associate Asia, as a region of exotic beauty and material opulence, of moral laxity and sensual excess, and of cultural decadence. To the Westerner, the seductiveness of the Orient implies spiritual threat and hidden existential danger, derived from the desire to be enticed and hypnotized, to be entrapped and suffocated in a masochistic surrender of white identity, \"to be engulfed by what Freudians might describe as a metaphoric womb–tomb\".\n\nA variant Yellow-Peril seductress is presented in the white-saviour romance between a \"White Knight\" from the West and a \"Lotus Blossom\" from the East; each redeems the other by way of mutual romantic love. Despite being a threat to the passive sexuality of white women, the romantic narrative favourably portrays the Lotus Blossom character as a woman who needs the love of a white man to rescue her from objectification by a flawed Asian culture. As a heroine, the Lotus-Blossom-woman is an ultra-feminine model of Asian pulchritude, social grace, and culture, whose own people trapped her in an inferior, gender-determined social-class. Only a white man can rescue her from such a cultural impasse, thereby, the narrative reaffirms the moral superiority of the Western world.\n\nIn \"The World of Suzie Wong\" (1960), the eponymous anti-heroine is a lost-soul prostitute saved by the love of Robert Lomax (William Holden), an American painter living in Hong Kong. The East–West sexual differences available to Lomax are two: an unpleasant, career-minded British girlfriend, Kay O'Neill (Sylvia Syms), who is mannishly independent; and Suzie Wong, who is a conventionally feminine and submissive woman. She works as a sexual prostitute because of her poverty in Hong Kong, which, the story suggests, is the natural condition of the peoples of Asia.\nMoreover, in 1959, the economic ascendancy of Hong Kong, as part of the \"Asian Tiger Economy\", had just begun to improve life for the Chinese. Nonetheless, despite the film's historical inaccuracy of background, the cultural contrast of the representations of Suzie Wong and Kay O'Neill imply that if a Western woman wants to win a cultured, Western man (like the painter Robert Lomax) she should emulate the sexually passive prostitute (Suzie Wong) rather than the independent and \"controlling\" career-woman (Kay O'Neill). As an Oriental stereotype, the submissive Asian girl (Lotus -Blossom Wong) shows her innate masochism when she \"proudly displays signs of a beating, to her fellow hookers, and uses it as evidence that her man loves her\", which condition further increases Lomax's need to rescue her.\n\nPsychologically, the painter Lomax needs the prostitute Wong, as the muse whose eroticism inspires the self-discipline necessary for becoming an accomplished painter. Suzie Wong is an illiterate orphan who was sexually abused as a girl; thus her toleration of abuse by most of her Chinese clients. That Lomax is portrayed as more enlightened and caring, than Chinese and British men, implies the moral superiority of the American culture over the decadent society of Hong Kong and over the decayed British Empire; the Americans shall be better geopolitical and cultural custodians of Asia than were the British. When a British sailor attempts to rape Wong, the chivalrous Lomax rescues her and beats the would-be rapist; all the while, Chinese men sat by, indifferent to the rape of a prostitute.\n\nAs a Lotus Blossom stereotype of the Yellow Peril, the prostitute Suzie Wong is a single mother, of a child, by a Chinese man who abandoned them; the socially dramatic backstory of the woman emphasises the casual cruelty of Hong Kong's Asian society. In contrast to the casual brutality (emotional and physical) with which Chinese and British characters treat Wong, the sensitive artist Lomax loves her as a \"child–woman\", and saves her with a new social identity as his Lotus Blossom, an ideal woman who is docile under his paternalism. Yet Lomax's love is conditional; throughout the story, she wears a Chinese Cheongsam dress, but when she dresses in Western clothes, Lomax rips off her dress, and orders her to only wear a cheongsam – Suzie Wong is acceptable only as an Asian girl created in conformity to the Western cultural mores of proper womanhood and femininity.\n\nIn the opera \"Miss Saigon\" (1989), the country of Vietnam is represented as a beautifully exotic and mysterious place of sensuous beauty, incomprehensible savagery, and much filth. The opening chorus of the first song, \"The Heat's on Saigon\", begins thus: \"The heat's on Saigon / The girls are hotter 'n hell / Tonight one of these slits will be Miss Saigon / God, the tension is high / Not to mention the smell\".\n\nThe first act, set in Saigon City, presents the adolescent prostitute-heroine named Kim, who is portrayed as a demure \"Lotus Blossom\" who is a sexually available and submissive Asian woman whose life is defined by her love for a white man, the American Marine Chris Scott. That every Vietnamese woman is a prostitute, and that all, but one, are Dragon Ladies who easily display their bodies in bikini swim suits, confirms the Western stereotype of the hyper-sexual Asian woman. The second act, set in Thailand, portrays Thai women as prostitutes, and reinforces the Western stereotype of the hyper-sexual Asian woman who is perpetually available to copulate. At the Dreamland brothel, Kim is the only woman who does not always dress in a bikini swimsuit. Her passivity, moral purity, and fidelity to the Marine Chris, who abandoned her and their son in South Vietnam, returned to the U.S. and married the American woman Ellen, suggests that subservience is the proper relation between an Asian woman and a white man.\n\nDespite working as a prostitute, the seventeen-year-old Kim is a virginal innocent who needs the Marine Chris to protect her from the cruel world of Saigon City. One of the songs that Chris sings about her suggests that Kim is Vietnam. In contrast to the aggressive Vietnamese male characters, the passive Kim is portrayed as being the true Vietnam. Moreover, the man Thuy, a Viet Cong guerrilla who wants to marry Kim, is portrayed as a jealous and possessive, violent and cruel man who seeks to exploit her, the opposite of Chris, who only seeks to love her. The character of the pimp, Tran Van Dinh, aka \"The Engineer\", is a Eurasian man whose sexuality is \"simply incomprehensible, illegible, indeterminate, even as it is spectacularly displayed\".\n\nEast Asia studies Professor Karen Shimakawa described the Engineer as \"simultaneously lascivious, sexually exploitative, pan-sexual \"and\" desexualized.\" Although the character was born of a French father and a Vietnamese mother, the libretto always emphasises his Oriental-ness. \"The Engineer embodies an un-categorizable, yet spectacular perversity – a condition that, the logic of the play suggests, is hereditary: It is the direct result of his racially and nationally mixed beginnings in prostitution and sexual debauchery\". The best friend of Chris, is a black man named John, an enthusiastic patron of the Dreamland brothel, fulfils the racial stereotype of the sexually voracious black man. Unlike the romantic Chris, John is given to crude, macho boasting about his sexual prowess, and only sees the women of the Dreamland brothel as sexual objects. In contrast to the flawed masculinity of the coloured men, the white Chris is a kind, gentle man who genuinely loves Kim, and sings: \"I wanted to save her, protect her / Christ, I'm an American / How could I fail to do good?\".\n\nThe essence of the Western fear of the Yellow Peril is that Asian men and women are sexually voracious people, whose Oriental cultures emphasise the sensual and sensuous aspects of life. As such, Oriental sexuality threatens the moral destruction of the Christian West, by way of enslavement to the senses. Prof. Tim Thompson said that a \"perfect example\" of such sexual fear of the Asian Other is the Canadian short story \"The Fall: With a Whimper\" (2007), by Tantric Legion, in the genre of graphic-pornography horror-story.\n\nIntelligent, hermaphrodite worms arrive to China from outer space; they are \"sexual parasites\" approximately one-foot in length and three-inches in diameter. In the scenes of infectious rape, the phallic worms penetrate the human body through vaginas and anuses, and then assume control of the victim's mind. The protagonist, Mei, a pretty, young schoolteacher in Jiuquan. In the first half of the story, the frightened Mei continually attempts to avoid infection, to no avail. After being infected, she sets out to infect the rest of humanity. As the self-named \"Mei host\", she considers herself a \"good slave\" who longs only to do the bidding of her \"masters\", her affectionate name for the worms that control her mind and body. Their \"one, fervent wish\" is to create a \"glorious, new civilization\" that will bless humanity with a \"shared consciousness\". Moreover, the worms also transform the bodies of the victims, and Mei host, now endowed with \"swollen breasts and a constant state of sexual arousal\", has no trouble seducing people, whom she infects with the phallic worms.\n\nThe authorial voice of the narrative presents Mei's transformation, from demure-\"Stoneman\"></ref> The images of flooding and bodily penetration evoke Yellow-Peril racism, and the classic, white xenophobia of the Chinese as a faceless horde overwhelming the rest of humanity, specifically, the white peoples of Western Europe and North America. Because the phallic worms are hermaphrodite, the infected Chinese are a literal foreign body infecting the men and women who are the world polity. Thematically, \"The Fall: With a Whimper\" evokes the white Christian fear of ambiguous sexual orientation; Western sexual anxieties psychologically projected onto the Asian Other. ()\n\nThe Yellow Peril was a common subject for colonial adventure fiction, of which the representative villain is Dr. Fu Manchu, created by Sax Rohmer, and featured in thirteen novels (1913–59). Fu Manchu is an evil Chinese gangster and mad scientist who means to conquer the world, despite continually being foiled by the British policeman and gentleman spy Sir Denis Nayland Smith, and his assistant Dr. Petrie.\n\nFu Manchu was patterned on the antagonist of the Yellow Peril series and novel \"The Yellow Danger; Or, what Might Happen in the Division of the Chinese Empire Should Estrange all European Countries\" (1898), by M. P. Shiel, published initially as the serial story \"The Empress of the Earth: The Tale of the Yellow War\"; and published in the U.S. first as \"China in Arms\" (1898), and then revised as \"The Yellow Danger: The Story of the World's Greatest War\" (1899) \n\nIn the context of the Fu Manchu series, and Shiel's influence, reviewer Jack Adrian described Sax Rohmer as a \n\nDr. Fu Manchu is the head of the Si-Fan, an international criminal organisation and a pan-Asian murder gang recruited from the \"darkest places of the East\" with countless Chinese, Burmese, Malay, and Indian thugs willing to perform any command. The novels feature the recurring scene wherein Fu Manchu despatches assassins (usually Chinese or Indian) to kill Nayland Smith and Dr. Petrie. In the course of adventure, they are surrounded by coloured foreigners wishing to harm them; the metaphor is that the East has trespassed into the West.\n\nIn the 1930s, Hollywood offered two contradictory images of Asian men: (i) The malevolent master-criminal, Dr. Fu Manchu; and (ii) The benevolent master-detective, Charlie Chan. As a Yellow Peril villain, Fu Manchu is \"Rohmer's concoction of cunning Asian villainy [that] connects with the irrational fears of proliferation and incursion: Racist myths often carried by the water imagery of flood, deluge, the tidal waves of immigrants, rivers of blood.\" In 1936, when the Nazis banned his novels in Germany, because they believed him Jewish, Sax Rohmer denied being racist and published a letter declaring himself \"a good Irishman\", wherein he was disingenuous about the why of the Nazi book-ban, because \"my stories are not inimical to Nazi ideals.\"\n\n\"The Mask of Fu Manchu\" (1932) reflects the white man's sexual-anxiety as the basis of Yellow Peril fear; thus Fu Manchu (Boris Karloff) urges his Asian army to \"Kill the white man and take his women!\" Incest, between father and daughter, is a recurrent theme in the narrative of \"The Mask of Fu Manchu\", especially the ambiguous nature of the relationship between Fu Manchu and his daughter, Fah Lo See (Myrna Loy), an example of the unnatural sexuality of the yellow race.\n\nEmperor Ming the Merciless, nemesis of Flash Gordon, was another iteration of the Fu Manchu trope. Peter Feng calls him a \"futuristic Yellow Peril\", quoting a reviewer who referred to Ming as a \"slanty eyed, shiny domed, pointy nailed, arching eyebrowed, exotically dressed Oriental\". Likewise, Buck Rogers fought against the Mongol Reds (aka the Hans), who had conquered the U.S. in the 25th century. In the late 1950s, Atlas Comics (Marvel Comics) published the Yellow Claw, a pastiche of the Fu Manchu stories. In the 1970s, Marvel Comics used Fu Manchu as the principal foe of his son, Shang-Chi, Master of Kung Fu.\n\nThe villain Li Shoon, created by H. Irving Hancock, appeared in \"Under the Ban of Li Shoon\" and \"Li Shoon's Deadliest Mission\" in Detective Story Magazine in 1916. Yellow Peril racial stereotypes were common currency in the genre literature of pulp magazine fiction of the early 20th century. Physically, Li Shoon is a \"tall and stout\" man with \"a round, moon-like yellow face\" with \"bulging eyebrows\" above \"sunken eyes\". Personally, Li Shoon is \"an amazing compound of evil\" and intellect, which makes him \"a wonder at everything wicked\" and \"a marvel of satanic cunning.\" In 1937, the publisher DC Comics featured \"Ching Lung\" on the cover and in the first issue of \"Detective Comics\" (March 1937).\n\n\"Yellow Peril: The Adventures of Sir John Weymouth–Smythe\", by Richard Jaccoma (1978) is a pastiche of the Fu Manchu novels by Sax Rohmer. Set in the 1930s, the novel is a distillation of the psychosexual and racist stereotypes of the Dragon Lady seductress and of the ruthless Mongol who threaten Western civilisation. The story is told in the genre's traditional first-person narrative of Sir John Weymouth–Smythe, an anti-hero who is simultaneously a lecher and a prude, continually torn between sensual desire and Victorian sensibility. The plot concerns Weymouth–Smythe's quest for the Spear of Destiny, a relic with supernatural power, which gives the possessor control of the world. Throughout the story, Weymouth–Smythe spends much time battling the nominal villain, Chou en Shu, for possession of the Spear of Destiny. In the course of the action, thematic developments reveal that the Yellow Peril is not the villain, but the (Nazi) Germans who were ostensible allies of the British anti-hero, Weymouth–Smythe, in the quest for the Spear of Destiny. The Nazis are led by Clara Schicksal, a stereotypical Teutonic blonde woman who sacrifices Burmese boys to ancient German gods, whilst fellating them; later, Weymouth–Symthe punishes Schicksal by sodomizing her.\n\n\n\n\n\n"}
