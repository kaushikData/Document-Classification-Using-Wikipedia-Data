The state-owned TV channel Television Maldives and Channel 13 owned by president Abdulla Yameen went to discredit the order by saying the Supreme Court website was hacked. The Supreme Court immediately responded by tweeting the website is not hacked.\n\nMaldivian Democratic Party was already holding a small peaceful gathering in front of their campaign headquarters who heard the news and many broke into tears including some Parliament members. They announced a gathering to be held on February 2, 2018 that night at 2:00 a.m.\n\nCabinet ministers question authenticity of the court order and said that they have not been able to be in contact with the Supreme Court. And they are tring to get direct communication with the justices.\n\nPresident Abdulla Yameen fired the Commissioner of Police Ahmed Areef and replaced by Ahmed Saudhee, claiming that Areef was not attending his phone calls. Ahmed saudhee also fired back by saying that he was trying to follow the court orders and president Yameen did not allow him to do his job.\n\nThe opposition held a peaceful rally 2 a.m midnight to celebrate the court ruling. Maldives Police Service an hour after the rally started used tear gas and pepper spray to disperse the crowd and leaving many affected.\n\nThe opening of People's Majlis was cancelled for security reasons and was being rescheduled as soon as it was possible.\n\nPresident Abdulla Yameen fires Acting-Commissioner of Police Ahmed Saudhee, and gave no clear reason why he fired Saudhee. Presidents office staff released a small statement only saying:\n\nPresident Abdulla Yameen hold a rally and officially announce his re-election and say he was not expecting the Supreme Court ruling, the state and all relevant authorities have to do a lot of work to see how to implement it.\n\nSpecial Operations Police were posted outside the Chief Justice of the Maldives, Abdulla Saeeds house.

The Indian government stated that they regard the situation as \"disturbing\". The \"Times of India\" reported that the Indian Armed Forces were on standby for \"deployment at short notice\" on potential operations in Maldives, ranging from the evacuation of nationals to a military intervention akin to that in the 1988 Operation Cactus.\n\n"}

{"id": "55931329", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=55931329", "title": "Aurora Colony", "text": "Aurora Colony\n\nAurora Colony, also called Aurora Mills, was a Christian utopian communal society founded in 1856 by William Keil in modern-day Aurora, Oregon, USA. At its peak in 1868, the Aurora Colony had about 600 people and of land. The colony, along with Keil's previously established Bethel colony, was formally dissolved in 1883. In 1974, about and 12 buildings of the former colony were inscribed on the National Register of Historic Places as parts of the Aurora Colony Historic District.\n\nWilliam Keil was a Prussian-born tailor who moved to the United States with his wife in the 1830s. He opened open a tailor shop in New York City, and studied pharmacology. He then moved to Pennsylvania and set up a drugstore and sold medicines. Around this time, he began calling himself \"Dr. Keil.\"\n\nIn 1839, Keil became a preacher after attending a Methodist revival meeting. In Pennsylvania, he began to amass followers, including members of George Rapp's Economy Colony. In 1844 he and his followers established the Bethel community in Missouri, which at its peak had 650 members.\n\nThough Keil's community in Missouri was successful and nearly self-sufficient, he decided to expand his colony to the Pacific Northwest of the United States. In 1853, he sent a scout party to find a location for \"A Second Eden.\"\n\nIn May 1855, Keil and several members of his Bethel colony in Missouri began the wagon journey to Washington Territory. Four days before they set out, Keil's son Willy died of malaria. Not wanting to leave his son behind, Keil put the body in a wooden, lead-lined coffin and covered it with Whiskey from the Bethel Distillery to preserve it.\n\nThe group first settled in Willapa Bay, Washington. After spending the Winter there, Keil decided the land was not suitable for a self-sufficient agricultural community and began searching for a new location. In 1856 he purchased land and a functioning mill south of Oregon City. He named the Colony Aurora Mills after his daughter, Aurora. The original colony contained 250 members who had left the Bethel Colony with Keil.\n\nThe Aurora Colony built homes, schools, business, mills, and a hotel. The colony also created a fruit orchard and produced hand-made goods. The Oregon & California Railway line expanded to pass through Aurora in 1870, which brought additional business to the colony. The train stopped four times a day for meals in its hotel.\n\nThe Aurora Colony Band became well known on the West Coast, and traveled throughout the region to perform music.\n\nThe charismatic Keil was the sole leader of the group. As the spiritual leader, he installed his own form of Christianity in the community. Keil preached a simple ideal about brotherhood and love and taught a \"No title but Christian\" and \"No rules but the Bible\" form of Christianity, maintaining that all existing religions were human creations.\n\nAs in many other utopian communities, its founder held special privileges. He instated confession in order to maintain the member's humility, yet was immune from taking part in confession himself. He was also exempt from taking part in manual labor. Keil lived in a large house in the colony, called \"Gross Haus\" (German for Big House).\n\nAs part of keeping order and maintaining his place in the community, Keil utilized mortification functions, calling out deviants for their transgressions during public meetings.\n\nIn 1862, a member of the colony took care of an individual outside the colony who had smallpox and brought it back to the Aurora Colony. As a result, many in Aurora contracted the disease and many died. Four of Keil's children died in the outbreak, including his daughter Aurora, the colony's namesake.\n\nKeil had held all the communal property in his name. In 1872, after the death of his only remaining daughter, Keil began to transfer ownership of colony land to individual families in the community and intended to transfer more later. However, by the time he died suddenly on December 30, 1877, he had not made any additional transfers.\n\nIt was decided to dissolve the two colonies, and the dissolution was formally declared on January 22, 1883. The land was later incorporated and became the modern-day city of Aurora, Oregon.\n\nIn 1966 the Old Aurora Colony Museum was established, dedicated to maintaining the history of the colony. In 1974, twenty sites in Aurora were added to the National Register of Historical Places.\n\nAuthor Jane Kirkpatrick wrote a trilogy of novels about the experience of Emma Wagner Giesy, the only female member of Keil's scout party to find a location for a new colony in the Pacific Northwest that eventually became the Aurora Colony. The three novels in Kirkpatrick's series are \"A Clearing in the Wild\" (2006), \"A Tendering In the Storm\" (2007), and \"Mending at the Edge\" (2008).\n\n"}

She was an influential participant of the Black Movement of Brazil from its beginnings in the 1960s until her death. Through her academic research, she evaluated the importance of \"quilombos\" as autonomous spaces for people of African descent during the colonial period and challenged the political environment and racial policies of the government toward Afro-Brazilians. Her scholarship on the invisibility of black women, and particularly non-Anglo women of the African diaspora had an international impact on research regarding the complexities of the black experience and lack of attention focused on Afro-Latinas in transnational feminism. \n\nMaria Beatriz do Nascimento was born on 12 July 1942 in Aracaju, Sergipe, Brazil to Rubina Pereira Nascimento and Francisco Xavier do Nascimento. Her father was a mason and her mother raised their ten children. Nascimento was their eighth child. Around 1949, the family migrated south and settled in the Cordovil neighborhood of Rio de Janeiro. After completing her secondary schooling, she enrolled at the Federal University of Rio de Janeiro (UFRJ), graduating with a bachelor's degree in history in 1971. During her schooling, she became involved in the Black Movement of Brazil (). Beginning as a student organizer, Nascimento was a co-founder of several associations and attended numerous conferences and public forum discussions on blackness and racial politics.\n\nUpon graduating, Nascimento began working as an intern at the Brazilian National Archives and continued her education, studying at the Fluminense Federal University (UFF). She married Jose do Rosario Freitas Gomes and the couple subsequently had a daughter, Bethânia Gomes. While at UFF, she was involved in the founding of the Andre Rebouças Working Group, which had a significant effect on the resurgence of black identity and the politicization of race under the Brazilian military government from 1974 to 1985. Her research during this period centered on ethnographic studies in three of the surviving \"quilombo communities\" (African-Brazilian Maroon societies) in Minas Gerais. Conducting interviews and evaluating archival materials, Nascimento came to recognize \"quilombos\" as \"autonomous black spaces of liberation\".\n\nIn 1977, Nascimento was one of the speakers at the \"Quinzena do Negro\" (Black Fortnight), organized by Eduardo Oliveira e Oliveira at the University of São Paulo. The conference was pivotal in Nascimento's development, and was where she secured her place as an anchor in the Black Movement, through her introduction of theoretical ideas about the significance of \"quilombos\" for Afro-Brazilians and the intersection of race and gender in the political environment for black women in Brazil. She also strongly criticized the Brazilian Academy of Sciences for its racist policies. In 1978, she joined the Movimento Negro Unificado Contra a Discriminação Racial (Unified Black Movement, or MNU) and over the next decade worked with Raquel Gerber, a filmmaker, on a documentary which would become one of her most important legacies. \n\nNascimento completed her graduate studies at UFF in 1981 and began a master's degree program at UFRJ studying communications with , a noted Brazilian sociologist and journalist. She taught history at the Rome State School (), in Copacabana and published articles in various newspapers and journals like \"Estudos Afro-Asiáticos\" (Afro-Asian Studies), \"Folha de São Paulo\", \"Revista Cultura Vozes\" (Culture Voices Magazine), and \"Revista do Patrimônio Histórico\" (Historical Patrimony Magazine), while serving on the editorial board of \"Boletim do Centenário da Abolição e República\" (Centennial Bulletin of Abolition and the Republic). In 1989, Nascimento and Gerber released \"Ori\", their documentary about the relationship between Africa and Brazil and the Black Movement in the country.\n\nNascimento was murdered on 28 January 1995 during a domestic dispute between Aurea and Antônio Jorge Amorim Viana, known as Danone. The murderer, Danone, believed that Nascimento had counseled his wife, Aurea to leave him because of their violent relationship. At the time of her death Nascimento and Gomes had separated, and she was in relationship with Roberto Rosemburg, her common law spouse. She was buried on 30 January 1995 at the Cemitério de São João Batista. Nascimento impacted international scholarship on black women, calling into question their invisibility because of patriarchy and colonialism, but also because of the over-emphasis on the English-speaking diaspora among academics and the language barriers to intellectual discourse from non-Anglo scholars. Nascimento caused feminist scholars to recognize the need for expanding research to encompass Afro-Latinas for a deeper understanding of the complexities impacting the African diaspora. Aléx Ratts published a biography on Nascimento and her career, \"Eu Sou Atlântica\" in 2007.\n\n"}

This person is called a \"nominee\", though nominee often is used interchangeably with \"candidate\". A presumptive nominee is a person or organization believes that the nomination is inevitable or likely. The act of being a candidate in a race for either a party nomination or for electoral office is called a \"candidacy\". Presumptive candidate may be used to describe someone who is predicted to be a formal candidate.\n\n\"Candidate\" is a derivative of the Latin \"candidus\" (shining white). In Ancient Rome, people running for political office would usually wear togas chalked and bleached to be bright white at speeches, debates, conventions, and other public functions.\n\nIn the context of elections for public office in a representational partisan democracy, a candidate who has been selected by a political party is normally said to be the nominee of that party. The party's selection (that is, the nomination) is typically accomplished either based on one or more primary elections according to the rules of the party and any applicable election laws.\n\nCandidates are called \"incumbents\" if they are already serving in the office for which they are seeking re-election, or \"challengers\", if they are seeking to replace an incumbent. \n\nIn the context of elections for public office in a direct democracy, a candidate can be nominated by any eligible person—and if parliamentary procedures are used, the nomination has to be seconded, i.e., receive agreement from a second person.\n\nIn some non-partisan representative systems (e.g., administrative elections of the Bahá'í Faith), no nominations (or campaigning, electioneering, etc.) take place at all, with voters free to choose any person at the time of voting—with some possible exceptions such as through a minimum age requirement—in the jurisdiction. In such cases, it is not required (or even possible) that the members of the electorate be familiar with all of the eligible persons in their area, though such systems may involve indirect elections at larger geographic levels to ensure that some first-hand familiarity among potential electees can exist at these levels (i.e., among the elected delegates).\n\nIn German politics, the person at the head of an electoral list is called the \"Spitzenkandidat\" (\"lead candidate\"). By convention, this means that this person (normally the party leader) will be elected to lead the government if their party wins the election. \n\nIn 2014, the major groups represented in the European Parliament and the European Council agreed to apply this process to determine the next President of the European Commission, as a way of the Council \"taking account of the results of the European Parliament election\" as required by the Union treaties. This led to the appointment and confirmation of Jean-Claude Juncker.\n\nThe term \"presumptive candidate\" is sometimes used to describe a person who has not officially become a candidate but is considered very likely to in the future.\n\n"}

Chauka comes from the Hindi word for square.\n\nThe system consists of square shaped embankments. On three sides there are nine inch walls and one side is left open to allow rainwater to fill the structure. As one structure fills, then the overflow fills the next chauka and so on. Retaining the rainwater in this way helps prevent soil erosion and recharges the surface water enabling various grasses to thrive. This has the effect of holding the soil together and, as the chauka system is used mostly on common land, provides grazing areas for cow and goat herds. For this to be effective it is combined with the planting of grass seeds and trees.\n\nThis system is widely in use in the Dudu block of Jaipur district in Rajasthan, India.

{"id": "66937", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=66937", "title": "Cisgender", "text": "Cisgender\n\nCisgender (often abbreviated to simply cis) is a term for people whose gender identity matches the sex that they were assigned at birth. \"Cisgender\" may also be defined as those who have \"a gender identity or perform a gender role society considers appropriate for one's sex\". It is the opposite of the term \"transgender\".\n\nRelated terms include cissexism and cisnormativity.\n\nGerman sexologist Volkmar Sigusch used the neologism \"cissexual\" (\"zissexuell\" in German) in a peer-reviewed publication. In his 1998 essay \"The Neosexual Revolution\", he cites his two-part 1991 article \"Die Transsexuellen und unser nosomorpher Blick\" (\"Transsexuals and our nosomorphic view\") as the origin of the term. He also used the term in the title of a 1995 article, \"Transsexueller Wunsch und zissexuelle Abwehr\" (or: \"Transsexual desire and cissexual defense\").\n\n\"Cisgender\" has its origin in the Latin-derived prefix \"cis-\", meaning \"on this side of\", which means the opposite of \"trans-\", meaning \"across from\" or \"on the other side of\". This usage can be seen in the cis–trans distinction in chemistry, the cis–trans or complementation test in genetics, in Ciscaucasia (from the Russian perspective), in the ancient Roman term Cisalpine Gaul (i.e., \"Gaul on this side of the Alps\"), and more recently, Cisjordan, as distinguished from Transjordan. In the case of gender, \"cis-\" describes the alignment of gender identity with assigned sex.\n\nSociologists Kristen Schilt and Laurel Westbrook define \"cisgender\" as a label for \"individuals who have a match between the gender they were assigned at birth, their bodies, and their personal identity\". A number of derivatives of the terms \"cisgender\" and \"cissexual\" include \"cis male\" for \"male assigned male at birth\", \"cis female\" for \"female assigned female at birth\", analogously \"cis man\" and \"cis woman\", and \"cissexism\" and \"cissexual assumption\". In addition, one study published in the \"Journal of the International AIDS Society\" used the term \"cisnormativity\", akin to sexual diversity studies' \"heteronormativity\". A related adjective is \"gender-normative\" because, as Eli R. Green writes, \"'cisgendered' is used [instead of the more popular 'gender normative'] to refer to people who do not identify with a gender diverse experience, without enforcing existence of a normative gender expression\". In this way, \"cisgender\" is preferable because, unlike the term \"gender-normative\", it does not imply that transgender identities are abnormal.\n\nJulia Serano has defined \"cissexual\" as \"people who are not transsexual and who have only ever experienced their mental and physical sexes as being aligned\", while \"cisgender\" is a slightly narrower term for those who do not identify as transgender (a larger cultural category than the more clinical transsexual). For Jessica Cadwallader, \"cissexual\" is \"a way of drawing attention to the unmarked norm, against which trans is identified, in which a person feels that their gender identity matches their body/sex\".\n\nThe terms \"cisgender\" and \"cissexual\" were used in a 2006 article in the \"Journal of Lesbian Studies\" and Serano's 2007 book \"Whipping Girl\", after which the term gained some popularity among English-speaking activists and scholars. Jillana Enteen wrote in 2009 that \"cissexual\" is \"meant to show that there are embedded assumptions encoded in expecting this seamless conformity\".\n\nSerano also uses the related term \"cissexism\", \"which is the belief that transsexuals' identified genders are inferior to, or less authentic than, those of cissexuals\". In 2010, the term \"cisgender privilege\" appeared in academic literature, defined as the \"set of unearned advantages that individuals who identify as the gender they were assigned at birth accrue solely due to having a cisgender identity\".\n\nWhile some believe that the term \"cisgender\" is merely politically correct, medical academics use the term and have recognized its importance in transgender studies since the 1990s.\n\nIn February 2014, Facebook began offering \"custom\" gender options, allowing users to identify with one or more gender-related terms from a selected list, including cis, cisgender, and others. \"Cisgender\" was also added to the \"Oxford English Dictionary\" in 2013, defined as \"designating a person whose sense of personal identity corresponds to the sex and gender assigned to him or her at birth (in contrast with transgender)\".\n\nKrista Scott-Dixon wrote in 2009: \"I prefer the term non-trans to other options such as cissexual/cisgendered.\" She holds this view because she believes the term \"non-trans\" is clearer to average people and will help normalize transgender individuals.\n\nWomen's and Gender Studies scholar Mimi Marinucci writes that some consider the \"cisgender–transgender\" binary to be just as dangerous or self-defeating as the masculine–feminine gender binary, because it lumps together people who identify as lesbian, gay, or bisexual (LGB) arbitrarily and over-simplistically with a heteronormative class of people as opposed to with transgender people. Characterizing LGB individuals together with heterosexual, non-trans people may problematically suggest that LGB individuals, unlike transgender individuals, \"experience no mismatch between their own gender identity and gender expression and cultural expectations regarding gender identity and expression\".\n\nGlosswitch wrote in the British magazine the \"New Statesman\" that if an essential gender binary does not exist, then the idea that one's identity matches their gender is maintaining a stereotype.\n\nIntersex people are born with atypical physical sex characteristics that can complicate initial sex assignment and lead to involuntary or coerced medical treatment. The term cisgender \"can get confusing\" in relation to people with intersex conditions, according to the Interact Advocates for Intersex Youth Inter/Act project. Hida Viloria of Intersex Campaign for Equality notes that, as a person born with an intersex body who has a non-binary sense of gender identity that \"matches\" his/her body, s/he is both cisgender and gender non-conforming, presumably opposites according to cisgender's definition, and that this evidences the term's basis on a binary sex model that does not account for intersex people's existence. S/he also critiques the fact that the term \"sex assigned at birth\" is used in one of cisgender's definitions without noting that babies are assigned male or female regardless of intersex status in most of the world, stating that doing so obfuscates the birth of intersex babies and frames gender identity within a binary male/female sex model that fails to account for both the existence of natally congruent gender non-conforming gender identities, and gender-based discrimination against intersex people based on natal sex characteristics rather than on gender identity or expression, such as \"normalizing\" infant genital surgeries. Organisation Intersex International Australia argues that, while most intersex people are not transgender, the term is problematic because of intersex people's experience, or risk of experiencing, \"involuntary medical treatment to impose stereotypical sex characteristics\". Intersex professor Cary Gabriel Costello has proposed using the term \"ipso gender\" instead of cisgender for intersex people who agree with their medically assigned sex.\n\n\n\n"}

The National Cybersecurity FFRDC, operated by the Mitre Corporation, maintains the system, with funding from the National Cyber Security Division of the United States Department of Homeland Security.\nThe Security Content Automation Protocol uses CVE, and CVE IDs are listed on MITRE's system as well as in the US National Vulnerability Database.\n\nMITRE Corporation's documentation defines CVE Identifiers (also called \"CVE names\", \"CVE numbers\", \"CVE-IDs\", and \"CVEs\") as unique, common identifiers for publicly known information-security vulnerabilities in publicly released software packages. Historically, CVE identifiers had a status of \"candidate\" (\"CAN-\") and could then be promoted to entries (\"CVE-\"), however this practice was ended some time ago and all identifiers are now assigned as CVEs. The assignment of a CVE number is not a guarantee that it will become an official CVE entry (e.g. a CVE may be improperly assigned to an issue which is not a security vulnerability, or which duplicates an existing entry).\n\nCVEs are assigned by a CVE Numbering Authority (CNA); there are three primary types of CVE number assignments:\n\n\nWhen investigating a vulnerability or potential vulnerability it helps to acquire a CVE number early on. CVE numbers may not appear in the MITRE or NVD CVE databases for some time (days, weeks, months or potentially years) due to issues that are embargoed (the CVE number has been assigned but the issue has not been made public), or in cases where the entry is not researched and written up by MITRE due to resource issues. The benefit of early CVE candidacy is that all future correspondence can refer to the CVE number. Information on getting CVE identifiers for issues with open source projects is available from Red Hat.\n\nCVEs are for software that has been publicly released; this can include betas and other pre-release versions if they are widely used. Commercial software is included in the \"publicly released\" category, however custom-built software that is not distributed would generally not be given a CVE. Additionally services (e.g. a Web-based email provider) are not assigned CVEs for vulnerabilities found in the service (e.g. an XSS vulnerability) unless the issue exists in an underlying software product that is publicly distributed.\n\nThe CVE database contains several fields:\n\nThis is a standardized text description of the issue(s). One common entry is:\n\nThis means that the entry number has been reserved by Mitre for an issue or a CNA has reserved the number. So in the case where a CNA requests a block of CVE numbers in advance (e.g. Red Hat currently requests CVEs in blocks of 500), the CVE number will be marked as reserved even though the CVE itself may not be assigned by the CNA for some time. Until the CVE is assigned AND Mitre is made aware of it (i.e., the embargo passes and the issue is made public), AND Mitre has researched the issue and written a description of it, entries will show up as \"**RESERVED **\".\n\nThis is a list of URLs and other information (such as vendor advisory numbers) for this issue.\n\nThis is the date the entry was created. For CVEs assigned directly by Mitre, this is the date Mitre created the CVE entry. For CVEs assigned by CNAs (e.g. Microsoft, Oracle, HP, Red Hat, etc.) this is also the date the entry was create by Mitre, not by the CNA. So in the case where a CNA requests a block of CVE numbers in advance (e.g. Red Hat currently requests CVEs in blocks of 500) the entry date would be when that CVE is assigned to the CNA. The CVE itself may not be used for days, weeks, months or even possibly years (e.g. Red Hat maintains blocks of CVEs for older security issues in open-source software that were not assigned CVEs yet).\n\nThe following fields were previously used in older CVE records, but are no longer used.\n\n\nIn order to support CVE ID's beyond CVE-YEAR-9999 (aka the CVE10k problem) a change was made to the CVE syntax in 2014 and took effect on Jan 13, 2015. \n\nThe new CVE-ID syntax is variable length and includes:\n\nCVE prefix + Year + Arbitrary Digits\n\nNOTE: The variable length arbitrary digits will begin at four (4) fixed digits and expand with arbitrary digits only when needed in a calendar year, for example, CVE-YYYY-NNNN and if needed CVE-YYYY-NNNNN, CVE-YYYY-NNNNNN, and so on. This also means there will be no changes needed to previously assigned CVE-IDs, which all include a minimum of 4 digits.\n\nCVE attempts to assign one CVE per security issue, however in many cases this would lead to an extremely large number of CVEs (e.g. where several dozen cross-site scripting vulnerabilities are found in a PHP application due to lack of use of htmlspecialchars() or the insecure creation of files in /tmp). To deal with this there are guidelines (subject to change) that cover the splitting and merging of issues into distinct CVE numbers. As a general guideline one should first consider issues to be merged, then issues should be split by the type of vulnerability (e.g. buffer overflow vs. stack overflow), then by the software version affected (e.g. if one issue affects version 1.3.4 through 2.5.4 and the other affects 1.3.4 through 2.5.8 they would be SPLIT) and then by the reporter of the issue (e.g. Alice reports one issue and Bob reports another issue the issues would be SPLIT into separate CVE numbers). Another example is Alice reports a /tmp file creation vulnerability in version 1.2.3 and earlier of ExampleSoft web browser, in addition to this issue several other /tmp file creation issues are found, in some cases this may be considered as two reporters (and thus SPLIT into two separate CVEs, or if Alice works for ExampleSoft and an ExampleSoft internal team finds the rest it may be MERGE'ed into a single CVE). Conversely issues can be merged, e.g. if Bob finds 145 XSS vulnerabilities in ExamplePlugin for ExampleFrameWork regardless of the versions affected and so on they may be merged into a single CVE.\n\nThe Mitre CVE database can be searched at the CVE List Search, and the NVD CVE database can be searched at Search CVE and CCE Vulnerability Database.\n\nCVE identifiers are intended for use with respect to identifying vulnerabilities:\nCommon Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) is a dictionary of common names (i.e., CVE Identifiers) for publicly known information security vulnerabilities. CVE’s common identifiers make it easier to share data across separate network security databases and tools, and provide a baseline for evaluating the coverage of an organization’s security tools. If a report from one of your security tools incorporates CVE Identifiers, you may then quickly and accurately access fix information in one or more separate CVE-compatible databases to remediate the problem.\nUsers who have been assigned a CVE identifier for a vulnerability are encouraged to ensure that they place the identifier in any related security reports, web pages, emails, and so on.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "410722", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=410722", "title": "Cultural hegemony", "text": "Cultural hegemony\n\nIn Marxist philosophy, cultural hegemony is the domination of a culturally diverse society by the ruling class who manipulate the culture of that society—the beliefs, explanations, perceptions, values, and mores—so that their imposed, ruling-class worldview becomes the accepted cultural norm; the universally valid dominant ideology, which justifies the social, political, and economic \"status quo\" as natural and inevitable, perpetual and beneficial for everyone, rather than as artificial social constructs that benefit only the ruling class.\n\nIn philosophy and in sociology, the term \"cultural hegemony\" has denotations and connotations derived from the Ancient Greek word \"ἡγεμονία (hegemonia)\" indicating leadership and rule. In politics, hegemony is the geopolitical method of indirect imperial dominance, with which the \"hegemon\" (leader state) rules subordinate states, by the threat of intervention, an implied means of power, rather than by direct military force, that is, invasion, occupation, and annexation.\n\nThe etymologic and historical evolution of the Greek word \"ἡγεμονία\", and of its denotations, has proceeded thus:\n\n\nIn 1848, Karl Marx proposed that the economic recessions and practical contradictions of a capitalist economy would provoke the working class to proletarian revolution, depose capitalism, restructure social institutions (economic, political, social) per the rational models of socialism, and thus begin the transition to a communist society. Therefore, the dialectical changes to the functioning of the economy of a society determine its social superstructures (culture and politics).\n\nTo that end, Antonio Gramsci proposed a \"strategic distinction\", between a War of Position and a War of Manœuvre. The war of position is an intellectual and cultural struggle wherein the anti-capitalist revolutionary creates a proletarian culture whose native value system counters the cultural hegemony of the bourgeoisie. The proletarian culture will increase class consciousness, teach revolutionary theory and historical analysis, and thus propagate further revolutionary organisation among the social classes. On winning the war of position, socialist leaders would then have the necessary political power and popular support to begin the political manœuvre warfare of revolutionary socialism.\n\nThe initial, theoretical application of cultural domination was as a Marxist analysis of \"economic class\" (base and superstructure), which Antonio Gramsci developed to comprehend \"social class\"; hence, cultural hegemony proposes that the prevailing cultural norms of a society, which are imposed by the ruling class (bourgeois cultural hegemony), must not be perceived as natural and inevitable, but must be recognized as artificial social constructs (institutions, practices, beliefs, et cetera) that must be investigated to discover their philosophic roots as instruments of social-class domination. That such praxis of knowledge is indispensable for the intellectual and political liberation of the proletariat, so that workers and peasants, the people of town and country, can create their own working-class culture, which specifically addresses their social and economic needs as social classes.\n\nIn a society, cultural hegemony is neither monolithic intellectual praxis, nor a unified system of values, but a complex of stratified social structures, wherein each social and economic class has a social purpose and an internal class-logic that allows its members to behave in a way that is particular and different from the behaviours of the members of other social classes, whilst co-existing with them as constituents of the society.\n\nAs a result of their different social purposes, the classes will be able to coalesce into a society with a greater social mission. When a man, a woman, or a child perceives the social structures of bourgeois cultural hegemony, personal common sense performs a dual, structural role (private and public) whereby the individual person applies common sense to cope with daily life, which explains (to himself and to herself) the small segment of the social order stratum that each experiences as the \"status quo\" of life in society; \"the way things are\". Publicly, the emergence of the perceptual limitations of personal common sense inhibit the individual person’s perception of the greater nature of the systematic socio-economic exploitation made possible by cultural hegemony. Because of the discrepancy in perceiving the \"status quo\"—the socio-economic hierarchy of bourgeois culture—most men and women concern themselves with their immediate (private) personal concerns, rather than with distant (public) concerns, and so do not think about and question the fundamental sources of their socio-economic oppression, and its discontents, social, personal, and political.\n\nThe effects of cultural hegemony are perceptible at the personal level; although each person in a society lives a meaningful life in his and her social class, to him and to her, the discrete social classes might appear to have little in common with the private life of the individual man and woman. Yet, when perceived as a whole society, the life of each person does contribute to the greater social hegemony. Although social diversity, economic variety, and political freedom appear to exist—because most people \"see\" different life-circumstances—they are incapable of perceiving the greater hegemonic pattern created when the lives they witness coalesce as a society. The cultural hegemony is manifested in and maintained by an existence of minor, different circumstances that are not always fully perceived by the men and the women living the culture.\n\nIn perceiving and combating cultural hegemony, the working class and the peasantry depend upon the intellectuals produced by their society, to which ends Antonio Gramsci distinguished between bourgeois-class intellectuals and working-class intellectuals, the proponents and the opponents of the imposed, normative culture, and thus of the social \"status quo\":\n\nCultural hegemony has philosophically influenced Eurocommunism, the social sciences, and the activist politics of socially liberal and progressive politicians. The analytic discourse of cultural hegemony is important to research and synthesis in anthropology, political science, sociology, and cultural studies; in education, cultural hegemony developed critical pedagogy, by which the root causes of political and social discontent can be identified, and so resolved.\n\nIn 1967, the German student movement leader Rudi Dutschke reformulated Antonio Gramsci's philosophy of cultural hegemony with the phrase \"The long march through the institutions\" (German: \"Marsch durch die Institutionen\") to identify the political war of position, an allusion to the Long March (1934–35) of the Communist Chinese People's Liberation Army, by means of which, the working class would produce their own organic intellectuals and culture (dominant ideology) to replace those imposed by the bourgeoisie.\n\nAs conceptual criticism of cultural hegemony, the structuralist philosopher Louis Althusser presented the theory of the ideological state apparatus to describe the structure of complex relationships, among the different organs of the State, by which ideology is transmitted and disseminated to the populations of a society. Althusser draws from the concepts of hegemony present in \"cultural hegemony\", yet rejects the absolute historicism proposed by Gramsci. He argues that the ideological state apparatuses (ISA) are the sites of ideological conflict among the social classes of a society. That, in contrast to the repressive state apparatuses (RSA), such as the military and the police forces, the ISA exist as a plurality. While the ruling class in power can readily control the repressive state apparatuses, the ISA are both the sites and the stakes (the objects) of class struggle. Moreover, the ISA are not monolithic social entities, and are distributed throughout the society, as public and as private sites of continual class struggle.\n\nIn \"On the Reproduction of Capitalism\" (1968), Louis Althusser said that the ideological apparatuses of the State are over-determined zones of society that comprise complex elements of the ideologies of previous modes of production, thus, are sites of continual political activity in a society, which are:\n\n\nAlthusser said that the parliamentary structures of the State, by which the “will of the people” is represented by elected delegates, are an ideological apparatus of the State. That the political system, itself, is an ideological apparatus, because it involves the “fiction, corresponding to a ‘certain’ reality, that the component parts of the [political] system, as well as the principle of its functioning, are based on the ideology of the ‘freedom’ and ‘equality’ of the individual voters and the ‘free choice’ of the people’s representatives, by the individuals that ‘make up’ the people.”\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "57810908", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=57810908", "title": "Data exfiltration", "text": "Data exfiltration\n\nData exfiltration occurs when malware and/or a malicious actor carries out an unauthorized data transfer from a computer. It is also commonly called data extrusion or data exportation. Data exfiltration is also considered a form of data theft. During the past couple decades, a number of data exfiltration efforts severely damaged the consumer confidence, corporate valuation, and intellectual property of businesses and national security of governments across the world.\n\nIn some data exfiltration scenarios, a large amount of aggregated data may be exfiltrated. However, in these and other scenarios, it is likely that certain types of data may be targeted. Types of data that are targeted includes:\n\n\nSeveral techniques have been used by malicious actors to carry out data exfiltration. The technique chosen depends on a number of factors. If the attacker has or can easily gain physical or privileged remote access to the server containing the data they wish to exfiltrate, their chances of success are much better than otherwise. For example, it would be relatively easy for a system administrator to plant, and in turn, execute malware that transmits data to an external command and control server without getting caught. Similarly, if one can gain physical administrative access, they can potentially steal the server holding the target data, or more realistically, transfer data from the server to a DVD or USB flash drive. In many cases, malicious actors cannot gain physical access to the physical systems holding target data. In these situations, they may compromise user accounts on remote access applications using manufacturer default or weak passwords. In 2009, after analyzing 200 data exfiltration attacks that took place in 24 countries, SpiderLabs discovered a ninety percent success rate in compromising user accounts on remote access applications without requiring brute-force attacks. Once a malicious actor gains this level of access, they may transfer target data elsewhere.\n\nAdditionally, there are more sophisticated forms of data exfiltration. Various techniques can be used to conceal detection by network defenses. For example, Cross Site Scripting (XSS) can be used to exploit vulnerabilities in web applications to provide a malicious actor with sensitive data. A timing channel can also be used to send data a few packets at a time at specified intervals in a way that is even more difficult for network defenses to detect and prevent. \nThere are a number of things that can be done to help defend a network against data exfiltration. Three main categories of preventative measures may be the most effective: \n\n\nOne example of detective measures is to implement intrusion detection and prevention systems and regularly monitor network services to ensure that only known acceptable services are running at any given time. If suspicious network services are running, investigate and take the appropriate measures immediately. Preventative measures include the implementation and maintenance of access controls, deception techniques, and encryption of data in process, in transit, and at rest. Investigative measures include various forensics actions and counter intelligence operations. \n\n"}

{"id": "25191", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=25191", "title": "Economy of Qatar", "text": "Economy of Qatar\n\nQatar's economy is one of the richest economies in the world based on GDP per capita, ranking between fifth and seventh on world rankings for 2015 and 2016 data compiled by the World Bank, United Nations, and IMF. \n\nPetroleum and natural gas are the cornerstones of Qatar's economy and account for more than 70% of total government revenue, more than 60% of gross domestic product, and roughly 85% of export earnings. Qatar has the world's third largest proven natural gas reserve and is the second-largest exporter of natural gas.\n\nBefore the emergence of petrol-based industry, Qatar was a poor pearl diving country. The exploration of oil and gas fields began in 1939. In 1973, oil production and revenues increased dramatically, moving Qatar out of the ranks of the world's poorest countries and providing it with one of the highest per capita incomes in the world.\n\nQatar's economy was in a downturn from 1982 to 1989. OPEC (Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries) quotas on crude oil production, the lower price for oil, and the generally unpromising outlook on international markets reduced oil earnings. In turn, the Qatari government's spending plans had to be cut to match lower income. The resulting recessionary local business climate caused many firms to lay off expatriate staff. With the economy recovering in the 1990s, expatriate populations, particularly from Egypt and South Asia, have grown again.\n\nOil production will not long remain at peak levels of 500,000 barrels (80,000 m³) per day, as oil fields are projected to be mostly depleted by 2023. However, large natural gas reserves have been located off Qatar's northeast coast. There have been found also some oil fields or some large gas fields containing larger amounts of oil. For example, the state owned Qatar Petroleum found 2 offshore oil fields in the 1960s. Back then production was too expensive. However, technological development led to production over 30 years later. Oil and gas condensate will also be produced in the gas fields.\n\nThe gas condensate can be refined to usual oil products in specialised refineries. The costs are a bit higher but it is normal today for companies to use the gas condensate too. Oil offshore production in 2008 for PS-2 and PS-3 blocks was about 31.1 million barrels (84,995 b/d). Joint Ventures facilities (PS-1, ALK, K & A): Combined oil production from these three joint venture production facilities in 2008 was 57.4 million barrels (156,873 b/d). Like with gas fields there are more offshore blocks which need to be explored and could increase the oil output. So the 500,000 bpd peak and a depletion in 2023 is delayed. With higher oil prices it is expected that the offshore exploration of oil and/or natural gas fields will go on. Oil production in June 2016 seemed to be around 670,000 barrels per day, a bit down from February 2016 production of 692,000 barrels per day. Taking all liquids together Qatar is already far beyond a million barrels per day.\n\nQatar's proved reserves of gas are the third-largest in the world, exceeding 7000 km³ (250 trillion cubic feet). The economy was boosted in 1991 by completion of the $1.5-billion Phase I of North Field gas development. In 1996, the Qatargas project began exporting liquefied natural gas (LNG) to Japan. Further phases of North Field gas development costing billions of dollars are in various stages of planning and development.\n\nQatar's heavy industrial projects, all based in Umm Said, include a refinery with a 50,000 barrels (8,000 m³) per day capacity, a fertilizer plant for urea and ammonia, a steel plant, and a petrochemical plant. All these industries use gas for fuel. Most are joint ventures between European and Japanese firms and the state-owned Qatar General Petroleum Corporation (QGPC). The U.S. is the major equipment supplier for Qatar's oil and gas industry, and U.S. companies are playing a major role in North Field gas development.\n890-\nQatar pursues a vigorous program of \"Qatarization\", under which all joint venture industries and government departments strive to move Qatari nationals into positions of greater authority. Growing numbers of foreign-educated Qataris, including many educated in the U.S., are returning home to assume key positions formerly occupied by expatriates. In order to control the influx of expatriate workers, Qatar has tightened the administration of its foreign manpower programs over the past several years. Security is the principal basis for Qatar's strict entry and immigration rules and regulations.\n\nThe government considers industry to be an integral part of its plan to diversify the economy and maximize its huge natural gas reserves, which serve as the primary feedstock for the sector. Accordingly, careful planning has gone into industrial development. With an eye towards exports, development has been clustered around the ports of Ras Laffan Industrial City and Mesaieed Industrial Area, which are key centers of energy. The result has seen considerable growth over the years. Industries Qatar (IQ), a producer of petrochemicals, fertilizers and steel, is a regional powerhouse, surpassed only in size by Saudi Basic Industries Corporation (SABIC), the Middle East’s largest chemical producer. In 2007 the manufacturing sector made the third-largest contribution to GDP among non-oil and gas sectors, equivalent to about 7.5% of GDP. \n\nPetrochemicals and fertilizers supply make up a large portion of the industrial base, along with steel and other construction materials, through Qatar Steel and Qatar Primary Material Company (QPMC). Indeed, over the past few years, demand for construction materials experienced a major surge as the development boom swept the Persian Gulf region. But the global financial crisis has put a significant dent in demand in the region, as project credit lines dry up and investor sentiment remains cautious. The crisis has in fact impacted the whole of the industrial sector – IQ saw its net profit drop in the fourth quarter of 2008 more than 90% over the same period the previous year. But in relative terms, the sector has fared better than most and IQ still managed to post an annual profit of $2bn. Large profit chunks from years past have been channeled into capital investments, which should help the sector ride out the storm. IQ, for example, is pushing several major expansion projects, worth almost $6bn, ahead. Qatar is expected to be one of the fastest growing economies in 2009 – the hope is it will be enough to keep the industrial sector on an upward trajectory.\n\nThe Qatari banking sector managed to escape the direct impact of the global subprime fallout, but was not altogether unscathed by its aftershocks. Overall, it was the best performing of the Gulf Cooperation Council markets in the last quarter of 2008 and most banks posted substantial profits for 2008. But the sector is also facing issues of liquidity, declining customer confidence and a forced reluctance to lend. In a bid to strengthen the banks’ positions, the Qatar Investment Authority (QIA) announced in early 2009 that it was willing to take a 10-20% stake in any interested local listed banks by way of a capital injection, although this was later reduced to 5% stakes and an additional 5% at the end of 2009. \n\nThe Qatari government also announced in March 2009 that it was planning to buy the investment portfolio of the banks in the hope this would encourage them to continue lending. Cautious sector sentiment has also been compounded by the Qatar Central Bank’s (QCB’s) lending restrictions, which demand a loan-to-deposit ratio of 90%. Given the high level of integration between Qatar’s economy and the Persian Gulf region, as well as the wider world, a slowdown in business and banking activity seemed inevitable. Nevertheless, Qatar’s banking sector has been faring relatively well, considering the strife experienced in other countries, and insiders are confident that activity will return to its previous brisk pace in the second half of 2009 as confidence slowly rebuilds around the globe.\n\nThe Islamic finance sector enjoyed increased activity in 2008 and is expected to continue to grow into 2009 as more sophisticated financial instruments spark the interest of investors. In addition to Islamic banks, such as Qatar Islamic Bank (QIB), Qatar International Islamic Bank (QIIB) and newcomer Masraf Al Rayyan, conventional banks have also been entering the sharia-compliant sector and are coming to view an Islamic subsidiary as a virtual necessity in order to maintain market standing. Islamic banks currently take the lion’s share of sharia-compliant business, though the conventional banks are working hard to take a greater share of market activity. Both Islamic banks and Islamic subsidiaries did remarkably well in the first three quarters of 2008, during which overall financing activity increased by 70.6% compared to the same period in the previous year. The global financial crisis slowed this growth though. Poor market conditions have contributed to a marked slowdown of Islamic bond, or sukuk, activity in 2008 throughout the Persian Gulf. But other segments, such as Islamic insurance, or takaful, have not seen a similar downturn. Overall, challenges to further growth remain, including a lack of qualified staff to meet the growing demand for sharia-compliant banking services.\n\nThe stock market capitalisation of listed companies in Qatar was valued at $95,487 million in 2007 by the World Bank. As 2008 drew to a close, no capital markets around the globe, including Qatar's, were immune to the effects of the sub-prime fallout. That said, there is considerable optimism that Qatar's bourse, the Doha Securities Market (DSM), will remain relatively resilient to the ongoing international turbulence. It has followed the same peak-trough trajectory as many others around the globe, hitting record highs in mid-2008, before diving in late 2008 and early 2009. Between December 2006 and July 2008 the DSM Index rose about 117% before the global financial crisis wiped out most of these gains. In the first few months of 2009, the DSM lost about 40% of its value. In an effort to stave off further losses, the government announced in February 2009 that it would step in to buy up shares of troubled banks amounting to about 10% of the market's capitalisation. The move improved investor optimism and is hoped to prevent the market from falling further. The proposal to create a single unified regulator as early as 2010 to oversee all banking and financial services is viewed as another promising development that will transform the financial sector for the better.\n\nUnder the ambitious five-year development plan of the Qatar Tourism and Exhibitions Authority (QTEA), the government aimed to boost the number of visitors from 964,000 as of 2007 to 1.5m by 2010. The funding required to meet this goal was present in sufficient amounts; in 2008 the state allocated some $17bn for tourism development through 2014, most of which was allocated towards hotels, exhibition space and infrastructure. In order to keep up with a rising number of visitors, the government set a goal of increasing hotel capacity 400% by 2012. In addition to financial support, the government has also worked to ease business regulations in a bid to increase private sector activity. A major aspect of expansion plans is the Hamad International Airport, which will have the capacity to handle up to 24m passengers upon the completion of the first phase in 2012.\n\nOther niche tourism segments receiving special focus include cultural tourism on the back of the high publicity opening of Doha’s Museum of Islamic Art, and sports tourism, initially spurred by the Asian Games, to which Qatar played host in 2006. The government appears to be committed to long-term expansion plans, but challenges nevertheless remain, including effective marketing to the international community as well as the effect of the financial crisis on global tourism appetite.\n\nWith a fast-expanding population and substantial economic growth over the past decade, a reliable and extensive transportation network is becoming increasingly necessary within Qatar. So far the government, the primary transport developer, has done well in terms of keeping up with demand for new transportation options. In 2008 the Public Works Authority (Ashghal), one of the bodies that oversees infrastructure development, underwent a major reorganisation in order to streamline and modernise the authority in preparation for major project expansions across all segments in the near future. Ashghal works in tandem with the Urban Planning and Development Authority (UPDA), the body that designed the transportation master plan, instituted in March 2006 and running to 2025.\nAs driving is the primary mode of transport in Qatar, the road network is a major focus of the plan. Project highlights in this segment include the multibillion-dollar Doha Expressway and the Qatar Bahrain Causeway, which will connect Qatar to Bahrain and Saudi Arabia and is considered a milestone in regional interconnectivity. Mass-transit options, such as a Doha metro, light-rail system and more extensive bus networks, are also under development to ease road congestion. In addition, the railway system is being significantly expanded and could eventually form an integral part of a GCC-wide network linking all the Arab states of the Persian Gulf. The airport, too, is expanding capacity to keep up with rising visitor numbers. The New Doha International Airport is one of the largest projects in Qatar today and will boast a capacity of 50m passengers upon completion in 2015. Finally, port infrastructure is seen as an integral part of Qatar's economic development as it focuses on LNG and industrial exports. The port at Mesaieed is undergoing expansion. While the financial crisis may present challenges to infrastructure development, once all projects are completed Qatar will have one of the most advanced and modern transport infrastructures in the region.\nQatar is now the richest country in the world, on a per person basis. Current GDP per capita registered a world record-breaking peak growth of 1,156% in the 70s. This became quickly unsustainable and Qatar's current GDP per capita contracted 53% in the 80s. But rising global oil demand helped current GDP per capita to expand 94% in the 90s. Diversification is still a long-term issue for this over-exposed economy.\n\nThis table is of Qatar's gross domestic product at market prices as estimated by the International Monetary Fund with figures in millions of Qatari Rials.\n\nFor purchasing power parity comparisons only, the US Dollar is exchanged at 3.67 Qatari Riyals. Mean wages were $59.99 per man-hour in 2009.\n\nIn February 2012, the International Bank of Qatar reported that GDP grew by 19.9% in 2011, but estimated that 2012 growth would slow to 9.8%\n\nThe following table shows the main economic indicators in 1980–2017. Inflation below 2 % is in green.\n\n"}
{"id": "3270433", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=3270433", "title": "Encounter killings by police", "text": "Encounter killings by police\n\n\"Encounter killing\" is a term used in South Asia since the late 20th century to describe killings by the police or the armed forces, allegedly in self-defence, when they encounter suspected gangsters or terrorists. In the 1990s and the mid-2000s, the Mumbai Police used encounter killings to attack the city's underworld, and the practice spread to other large cities.\n\nCritics are sceptical of many of these reported incidents, and further complain that the wide acceptance of the practice has led to incidents of police creating 'false encounters' to cover-up the killing of suspects when they are either in custody or are unarmed.\n\nThis term has come into popular use in India since the late 20th century because of a very high frequency of encounter killings by police in such cities as Mumbai, Chennai, and Kolkata. Some of the killings have been controversial, and critics have alleged that the police created 'fake encounters' as opportunities to kill suspects.\n\nAccording to the National Human Rights Commission (NHRC) of India, there were many cases of alleged fake encounters:\n440 cases. States with high number of cases were: Uttar Pradesh (231), Rajasthan (33), Maharashtra (31), Delhi (26), Andhra Pradesh (22) and Uttarakhand (19).\n\n555 cases. States with high number of cases were: Uttar Pradesh (138), Manipur (62), Assam (52), West Bengal (35) and Jharkhand (30).\n\nOn 11 January 1982, the gangster Manya Surve was shot dead by police officers Raja Tambat and Isaque Bagwan at the Wadala area. This is often referred to as the city's first recognised encounter killing. From that period until early 2003, the police killed 1,200 alleged criminals.\n\nMembers of the Mumbai Police involved in these killings became widely known as 'encounter specialists', and several became well-known to the public in India, including:\n\nThe term 'police encounter' was used often during the Punjab insurgency between 1984 and 1995. During this time, Punjab police officials reported 'encounters' to local newspapers and to the family members of those killed. The victim was typically a person whom the police believed to be a militant or involved in the militant separatist movement; proof of alleged militant involvement was rarely given. Ultimately, the practice became so common that 'encounter' became synonymous with extrajudicial execution.\n\nIt is alleged that police typically take a suspected militant into custody without filing an arrest report. If the suspect dies during interrogation, security forces would deny ever taking the person into custody and instead claim that he was killed during an armed encounter, placing weapons on or near the body to suggest the police acted in self-defence.\n\nSukhwinder Singh Bhatti, a criminal defence attorney in Punjab who defended such suspects, disappeared in May 1994 and is alleged to have been killed by the police.\n\nBetween 2002 and 2006, 22 police encounter killings were reported in Gujarat. According to the NHRC figures, during 2002–2007, there were four alleged fake encounters in Gujarat (out of 440 fake encounters in all of India). These cases gained national media attention:\n\n\nIt is notable that the only cases which attracts media attention among the hundreds of fake encounter cases as per the data available at public disposal from NHRC .Crimes are reduced due to encounters.peoples are feeling safe.\n\nWhen NDA government comes in power in state in March 2017, they ordered state police and initiated the encounter against criminals. There are a lots of controversies happens and police start killing innocents civilians under this plan. National human rights commission issued notice to state government and bench of three judges from supreme court of India already warned and issue notice to Uttar Pradesh government in this case. Following are the cases of fake encounter happened in Uttar Pradesh from 2017 to till date. \n\nVeerappan, the notorious forest brigand, was reportedly killed by the Special Task Force (STF) in an encounter on 18 October 2004. Some human rights organisations claimed that the circumstantial evidence indicated that he was killed in a fake encounter after being tortured by the police.\n\nOn 19 September 2008, Delhi-police Inspector Mohan Chand Sharma, a decorated officer, and two suspects were killed in the Batla House encounter case in New Delhi. The encounter led to the arrest of two suspected Indian Mujahideen (IM) terrorists, while a third managed to escape. The Shahi Imam of the Jama Masjid termed the encounter as 'totally fake\"' and accused the government of harassing Muslims. Several political parties and activists demanded a probe into the allegations that the encounter was fake. After an investigation, the National Human Rights Commission cleared the Delhi Police personnel of any violations of human rights.\n\nAn alleged 'encounter' in 1991, led to the 2016 sentencing of 47 policemen to life imprisonment for the slaying of 11 Sikh pilgrims in the Pilibhit district of Uttar Pradesh.\n\nPolice encounters have been featured in several fiction and non-fiction arts.\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

Equality Pennsylvania also attempts to \"advance LGBT-friendly policy and legislative initiatives\". The organization is a member of the Equality Federation.\n\nEquality Pennsylvania was founded by Andrew Park in 1996 in Philadelphia as the Center for Lesbian and Gay Civil Rights. Upon its founding, the Center provided legal services to members of the LGBT community in Philadelphia. The organization specifically provided assistance with HIV/AIDS discrimination and transgender name-change cases for the LGBT community. The organization eventually developed into Equality Advocates PA, which helped to advocate for LGBT rights along with its previous goal of providing legal representation to the LGBT community. Equality Advocates PA was instrumental in defeating constitutional amendments banning same-sex marriage in 2006 and 2008. In 2007, the organization also began to help draft LGBT non-discrimination legislation throughout the state. In 2009, the Equality Advocates PA reorganized under the name of Equality Pennsylvania. Along with changing the name of the organization, this reorganization saw the installation of a new board of directors and a new mission, which is to advocate for LGBT rights and LGBT legislation throughout Pennsylvania as a 501(c)(4) organization. The organization also reassigned its legal responsibilities to the Mazzoni Center to ensure that it could offer its complete focus to advocating for equality for LGBT individuals. In 2010, the organization hired Ted Martin to become the Executive Director and opened an office in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania to help expand the focus of the organization beyond Philadelphia and to allow for easier access to the General Assembly and the Governor. Following Martin's resignation in June 2017, the organization closed its Harrisburg office and established an even greater statewide network through the activation of regional chapters and with board members across the Commonwealth. \n\nEquality Pennsylvania's related entities include:\n\n\nEquality Pennsylvania routinely endorses candidates seeking office both nationwide and in the state of Pennsylvania. On December 15, 2011, the organization endorsed President Barack Obama in his re-election campaign. Equality Pennsylvania also endorsed numerous candidates during the Pennsylvania State Primaries. These candidates include Brian Sims, whose victory in the Democratic Primary in the 182nd District should allow him to be the first openly gay member of the Pennsylvania General Assembly.\n\nEquality Pennsylvania, in its role as an advocacy group for LGBT rights, has engaged in numerous political activities. This includes negotiating LGBT non-discrimination legislation throughout the state. Currently, 28 local communities have adopted non-discrimination legislation. Equality Pennsylvania also was instrumental in the establishment of the LGBT Equality Caucus in the Pennsylvania General Assembly. The organization has also partnered with the Freedom to Marry and the Courage Campaign to attempt to convince Senator Bob Casey to support the Respect for Marriage Act.\n\nEquality Pennsylvania is also administers the Equality Pennsylvania PAC, which is a political action committee that supports candidates throughout the state who the organization believes will help \"secure and protect equality and opportunity for lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender Pennsylvanians and their families\".\n\nThe Equality Pennsylvania Educational Fund is the 501(c)(3) wing of the organization which looks to \"provide educational programming on LGBT issues, conduct research to understand public opinions, mobilize a community of LGBT people and straight allies, and develop campaigns to build public support for fairness and equality\".\n\n"}

It was founded in Barcelona in the winter of 1933, during the Second Spanish Republic. Many of their members came from Unión Aragonesista and had their origins in the north-east Aragonese region of Ribagorza. The president was Gaspar Torrente.\n\nThe youth wing of the party, \"Los Almogávares\" ('The Almogavars'), headed by Luis Porté, supported the declaration of the Catalan Republic by Lluis Companys in 1934, what lead to their headquarters being closed down. The organization was quite inactive until 1936, when they opened a new head office and Miguel Alcubierre was elected as the president of the youth wing. He started a campaign for self-government in Aragon which aroused the interest of the rest of left-wing Republican parties.\n\nThose actions led to a Congress taking place in Caspe (Saragossa) at the beginning of May in 1936, with Torrente as the chairman. The result was the draft of a Statute of Autonomy for Aragon, which would not come to the light due to the onset of the Spanish Civil War. By 1939 the party had ceased to exist.\n\n\"Renacimiento Aragonés\" ('Aragonese Revival') was the party's official publication. The party was in good relations with the Catalan party Esquerra Republicana de Catalunya.\n\nIn 2006, Estau Aragonés (\"Estado Aragonés\" in Spanish, \"Estat Aragonès\" in Catalan) was founded as a new political party, inspired by the one of 1933 in a sort of refoundation. It aims for the independence of Aragon and the liberation of the Aragonese working class. The youth wing is Astral-Mozardalla d'Estau Aragonés.\n\nIn 2007, both Estau Aragonés and Astral, along with other Aragonese pro-independence organizations (Chobenalla, Puyalón, A Enrestida and the Aragonese Workers' Union, STA) formed a political bloc, called \"Bloque Independentista de Cuchas\" (Aragonese for 'Left Independentist Block').\n\n"}

They include Thomas Andrews Drake, a former National Security Agency (NSA) employee who was critical of the Trailblazer Project, Stephen Jin-Woo Kim, a State Department contractor who allegedly had a conversation about North Korea with James Rosen of Fox News Channel, and Jeffrey Sterling, who allegedly was a source for James Risen's book . Risen has also been subpoenaed to reveal his sources, another rare action by the government. Also, Shamai Leibowitz, a contract linguist for the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) was convicted of leaking information from embassy wiretaps, John Kiriakou, a former CIA analyst pleaded guilty to passing classified information, Chelsea Manning, an intelligence analyst for the US Army pleaded guilty to passing classified information to the WikiLeaks organization, and James Hitselberger, a former contract linguist for the US Navy in Bahrain is charged with possessing classified documents. Edward Snowden, a technical contractor for the NSA and former employee of the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA), is currently at large and has been charged with theft and the unauthorized disclosure of classified information to columnist Glenn Greenwald.\nReporters Without Borders' 2014 Press Freedom Index saw a drop of 13 ranks for the United States due to their \"treatment of whistleblowers, leakers, and those who assist them\" in 2013. The country fell to 46th place, between Romania and Haiti. The United Kingdom fell three places for similar reasons. The Index is meant to highlight places where journalists and photographers are free to do their work, as well as places where the work puts them in danger. Reporters Without Borders' executive director Christian Mihr stated: \"In the US, state persecution of investigative journalists and their sources by security services has reached an unprecedented level. If sources can no longer be trusted, we face a significant curtailment of press freedom and a dramatic step backwards when it comes to democracy.\"\n\n\"The Guardian\" is a UK-based newspaper with an international reach. In 2013, \"The Guardian\" received a copy of data from NSA whistleblower Edward Snowden.\n\nIn June and July 2013, Prime Minister David Cameron sent Jeremy Heywood, the Cabinet Secretary, to meet with Alan Rusbridger, editor of \"The Guardian\". Accordingly, Heywood ordered the editor to cease publishing articles based on the Snowden disclosures. According to \"The Guardian\", Heywood said: \"We can do this nicely or we can go to law\", adding that \"A lot of people in government think you should be closed down\".\n\nOn July 20, the destruction of computer hard-drives was carried out by several \"Guardian\" staff members under the observation of experts from GCHQ.\n\n\"The Guardian\" said the authorities were told of the existence of multiple copies of the data outside the UK. The deputy editor, Paul Johnson, who was involved in the destruction told Luke Harding about the experience. \"It was purely a symbolic act\", Johnson said. \"We knew that. GCHQ knew that. And the government knew that. It was the most surreal event I have witnessed in British journalism\".\n\nIn August 2013 the Metropolitan Police detained Greenwald's partner David Miranda at London's Heathrow Airport under Schedule 7 of the Terrorism Act 2000, while he was traveling home from Berlin. A February 2014 court decision upheld the detention as appropriate.\n\nGreenwald described his partner's detention as \"clearly intended to send a message of intimidation to those of us who have been reporting on the NSA and GCHQ\". Miranda was detained for nine hours and his laptop and other items were seized. He has since sued the Metropolitan Police for misuse of their powers. According to \"The Guardian\" the claim, \"challenging controversial powers used under schedule 7 to the Terrorism Act 2000, maintains that Miranda was not involved in terrorism and says his right to freedom of expression was curtailed\".\n\nIn December 2013, Greenwald and Miranda openly advocated for asylum in Brazil for Edward Snowden in exchange for the fugitive\nleaker's cooperation in investigating the NSA. Brazil responded by saying that it was not interested in investigating the NSA.\n\nDirector Clapper has referred to Snowden's \"accomplices\", while Rep. Peter King explicitly accused Greenwald of having Snowden as an \"accomplice\".

{"id": "13109", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=13109", "title": "Global warming controversy", "text": "Global warming controversy\n\nThe global warming controversy concerns the public debate over whether global warming is occurring, how much has occurred in modern times, what has caused it, what its effects will be, whether any action should be taken to curb it, and if so what that action should be. In the scientific literature, there is a strong consensus that global surface temperatures have increased in recent decades and that the trend is caused by human-induced emissions of greenhouse gases. No scientific body of national or international standing disagrees with this view, though a few organizations with members in extractive industries hold non-committal positions.\n\nThe controversy is, by now, political rather than scientific: there is a scientific consensus that climate change is happening and is caused by human activity. Disputes over the key scientific facts of global warming are more prevalent in the media than in the scientific literature, where such issues are treated as resolved, and such disputes are more prevalent in the United States than globally.\n\nPolitical and popular debate concerning the existence and cause of climate change includes the reasons for the increase seen in the instrumental temperature record, whether the warming trend exceeds normal climatic variations, and whether human activities have contributed significantly to it. Scientists have resolved these questions decisively in favour of the view that the current warming trend exists and is ongoing, that human activity is the cause, and that it is without precedent in at least 2000 years. Public disputes that also reflect scientific debate include estimates of how responsive the climate system might be to any given level of greenhouse gases (climate sensitivity), how global climate change will play out at local and regional scales, and what the consequences of global warming will be.\n\nGlobal warming remains an issue of widespread political debate, often split along party political lines, especially in the United States. Many of the issues that are settled within the scientific community, such as human responsibility for global warming, remain the subject of politically or economically motivated attempts to downplay, dismiss or deny them—an ideological phenomenon categorised by academics and scientists as climate change denial. The sources of funding for those involved with climate science—both supporting and opposing mainstream scientific positions—have been questioned by both sides. There are debates about the best policy responses to the science, their cost-effectiveness and their urgency. Climate scientists, especially in the United States, have reported official and oil-industry pressure to censor or suppress their work and hide scientific data, with directives not to discuss the subject in public communications. Legal cases regarding global warming, its effects, and measures to reduce it have reached American courts. The fossil fuels lobby has been identified as overtly or covertly supporting efforts to undermine or discredit the scientific consensus on global warming.\n\nIn the United States, the mass media devoted little coverage to global warming until the drought of 1988, and James E. Hansen's testimony to the Senate, which explicitly attributed \"the abnormally hot weather plaguing our nation\" to global warming.\n\nThe British press also changed its coverage at the end of 1988, following a speech by Margaret Thatcher to the Royal Society advocating action against human-induced climate change. According to Anabela Carvalho, an academic analyst, Thatcher's \"appropriation\" of the risks of climate change to promote nuclear power, in the context of the dismantling of the coal industry following the 1984–1985 miners' strike was one reason for the change in public discourse. At the same time environmental organizations and the political opposition were demanding \"solutions that contrasted with the government's\". In May 2013 Charles, Prince of Wales took a strong stance criticising both climate change deniers and corporate lobbyists by likening the Earth to a dying patient. \"A scientific hypothesis is tested to absolute destruction, but medicine can't wait. If a doctor sees a child with a fever, he can't wait for [endless] tests. He has to act on what is there.\"\n\nMany European countries took action to reduce greenhouse gas emissions before 1990. West Germany started to take action after the Green Party took seats in Parliament in the 1980s. All countries of the European Union ratified the 1997 Kyoto Protocol. Substantial activity by NGOs took place as well. The United States Energy Information Administration reports that, in the United States, \"The 2012 downturn means that emissions are at their lowest level since 1994 and over 12% below the recent 2007 peak.\"\n\nThe theory that increases in greenhouse gases would lead to an increase in temperature was first proposed by the Swedish chemist Svante Arrhenius in 1896, but climate change did not arise as a political issue until the 1990s. It took many years for this particular issue to attract any type of attention.\n\nIn Europe, the notion of human influence on climate gained wide acceptance more rapidly than in the United States and other countries. A 2009 survey found that Europeans rated climate change as the second most serious problem facing the world, between \"poverty, the lack of food and drinking water\" and \"a major global economic downturn\". 87% of Europeans considered climate change to be a very serious or serious problem, while ten per cent did not consider it a serious problem.\n\nIn 2007, the BBC announced the cancellation of a planned television special Planet Relief, which would have highlighted the global warming issue and included a mass electrical switch-off. The editor of BBC's Newsnight current affairs show said: \"It is absolutely not the BBC's job to save the planet. I think there are a lot of people who think that, but it must be stopped.\" Author Mark Lynas said \"The only reason why this became an issue is that there is a small but vociferous group of extreme right-wing climate 'sceptics' lobbying against taking action, so the BBC is behaving like a coward and refusing to take a more consistent stance.\"\n\nThe authors of the 2010 book \"Merchants of Doubt\", provide documentation for the assertion that professional deniers have tried to sow seeds of doubt in public opinion in order to halt any meaningful social or political progress to reduce the impact of human carbon emissions. The fact that only half of the American population believe that global warming is caused by human activity could be seen as a victory for these deniers. One of the authors' main arguments is that most prominent scientists who have been voicing opposition to the near-universal consensus are being funded by industries, such as automotive and oil, that stand to lose money by government actions to regulate greenhouse gases. \n\nA compendium of poll results on public perceptions about global warming is below.\n\nIn 2007, a report on public perceptions in the United Kingdom by Ipsos MORI reported that\n\n\nThe Canadian science broadcaster and environmental activist David Suzuki reports that focus groups organized by the David Suzuki Foundation in 2006 showed that the public has a poor understanding of the science behind global warming. This is despite publicity through different means, including the films \"An Inconvenient Truth\" and \"The 11th Hour\".\n\nAn example of the poor understanding is public confusion between global warming and ozone depletion or other environmental problems.\n\nA 15-nation poll conducted in 2006, by Pew Global found that there \"is a substantial gap in concern over global warming—roughly two-thirds of Japanese (66%) and Indians (65%) say they personally worry a great deal about global warming. Roughly half of the populations of Spain (51%) and France (46%) also express great concern over global warming, based on those who have heard about the issue. But there is no evidence of alarm over global warming in either the United States or China—the two largest producers of greenhouse gases. Just 19% of Americans and 20% of the Chinese who have heard of the issue say they worry a lot about global warming—the lowest percentages in the 15 countries surveyed. Moreover, nearly half of Americans (47%) and somewhat fewer Chinese (37%) express little or no concern about the problem.\"\n\nA 47-nation poll by Pew Global Attitudes conducted in 2007, found, \"Substantial majorities 25 of 37 countries say global warming is a 'very serious' problem.\"\n\nThere are differences between the opinion of scientists and that of the general public. A 2009 poll, in the US by Pew Research Center found \"[w]hile 84% of scientists say the earth is getting warmer because of human activity such as burning fossil fuels, just 49% of the public agrees\". A 2010 poll in the UK for the BBC showed \"Climate scepticism on the rise\". Robert Watson found this \"very disappointing\" and said \"We need the public to understand that climate change is serious so they will change their habits and help us move towards a low carbon economy.\"\nA 2012 Canadian poll, found that 32% of Canadians said they believe climate change is happening because of human activity, while 54% said they believe it’s because of human activity and partially due to natural climate variation. 9% believe climate change is occurring due to natural climate variation, and only 2% said they don't believe climate change is occurring at all.\n\nMany of the critics of the consensus view on global warming have disagreed, in whole or part, with the scientific consensus regarding other issues, particularly those relating to environmental risks, such as ozone depletion, DDT, and passive smoking. Chris Mooney, author of \"The Republican War on Science\", has argued that the appearance of overlapping groups of skeptical scientists, commentators and think tanks in seemingly unrelated controversies results from an organized attempt to replace scientific analysis with political ideology. Mooney says that the promotion of doubt regarding issues that are politically, but not scientifically, controversial became increasingly prevalent under the George W. Bush administration, which, he says, regularly distorted and/or suppressed scientific research to further its own political aims. This is also the subject of a 2004 book by environmental lawyer Robert F. Kennedy, Jr. titled \"Crimes Against Nature: How George W. Bush and Corporate Pals are Plundering the Country and Hijacking Our Democracy\" (). Another book on this topic is \"The Assault on Reason\" by former Vice President of the United States Al Gore. Earlier instances of this trend are also covered in the book \"The Heat Is On\" by Ross Gelbspan. \n\nSome critics of the scientific consensus on global warming have argued that these issues should not be linked and that reference to them constitutes an unjustified ad hominem attack. Political scientist Roger Pielke, Jr., responding to Mooney, has argued that science is inevitably intertwined with politics.\n\nIn 2015, according to \"The New York Times\" and others, oil companies knew that burning oil and gas could cause global warming since the 1970s but, nonetheless, funded deniers for years.\n\nThe finding that the climate has warmed in recent decades and that human activities are producing global climate change has been endorsed by every national science academy that has issued a statement on climate change, including the science academies of all of the major industrialized countries.\n\nAttribution of recent climate change discusses how global warming is attributed to anthropogenic greenhouse gases (GHGs).\n\nScientific consensus is normally achieved through communication at conferences, publication in the scientific literature, replication (reproducible results by others), and peer review. In the case of global warming, many governmental reports, the media in many countries, and environmental groups, have stated that there is virtually unanimous scientific agreement that human-caused global warming is real and poses a serious concern. According to the United States National Research Council,\nAmong opponents of the mainstream scientific assessment, some say that while there is agreement that humans do have an effect on climate, there is no universal agreement about the quantitative magnitude of anthropogenic global warming (AGW) relative to natural forcings and its harm-to-benefit ratio. Other opponents assert that some kind of ill-defined \"consensus argument\" is being used, and then dismiss this by arguing that science is based on facts rather than consensus. Some highlight the dangers of focusing on only one viewpoint in the context of what they say is unsettled science, or point out that science is based on facts and not on opinion polls or consensus.\n\nDennis T. Avery, a food policy analyst at the Hudson Institute, wrote an article titled \"500 Scientists Whose Research Contradicts Man-Made Global Warming Scares\" published in 2007, by The Heartland Institute. The list was immediately called into question for misunderstanding and distorting the conclusions of many of the named studies and citing outdated, flawed studies that had long been abandoned. Many of the scientists included in the list demanded their names be removed. The Heartland Institute refused these requests, stating that the scientists \"have no right—legally or ethically—to demand that their names be removed from a bibliography composed by researchers with whom they disagree\" despite the aforementioned falsification and refutation of much of the list.\n\nA 2010 paper in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences analysed \"1,372 climate researchers and their publication and citation data to show that (i) 97–98% of the climate researchers most actively publishing in the field support the tenets of ACC [anthropogenic climate change] outlined by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, and (ii) the relative climate expertise and scientific prominence of the researchers unconvinced of ACC are substantially below that of the convinced researchers\". Judith Curry has said \"This is a completely unconvincing analysis\", whereas Naomi Oreskes said that the paper shows \"the vast majority of working [climate] research scientists are in agreement [on climate change]... Those who don't agree, are, unfortunately—and this is hard to say without sounding elitist—mostly either not actually climate researchers or not very productive researchers.\" Jim Prall, one of the coauthors of the study, acknowledged \"it would be helpful to have lukewarm [as] a third category.\"\n\nA 2013 study, published in the peer-reviewed journal \"Environmental Research Letters\" analyzed 11,944 abstracts from papers published in the peer-reviewed scientific literature between 1991 and 2011, identified by searching the ISI Web of Science citation index engine for the text strings \"global climate change\" or \"global warming\". The authors found that 3974 of the abstracts expressed a position on anthropogenic global warming, and that 97.1% of those endorsed the consensus that humans are causing global warming. The authors found that of the 11,944 abstracts, 3896 endorsed that consensus, 7930 took no position on it, 78 rejected the consensus, and 40 expressed uncertainty about it.\n\nIn 2014, a letter from 52 leading skeptics was published by the Committee for Skeptical Inquiry supporting the scientific consensus and asking the media to stop referring to deniers as \"skeptics.\" The letter clarified the skeptical opinion on climate and denial: \"As scientific skeptics, we are well aware of political efforts to undermine climate science by those who deny reality but do not engage in scientific research or consider evidence that their deeply held opinions are wrong. The most appropriate word to describe the behavior of those individuals is 'denial'. Not all individuals who call themselves climate change skeptics are deniers. But virtually all deniers have falsely branded themselves as skeptics. By perpetrating this misnomer, journalists have granted undeserved credibility to those who reject science and scientific inquiry.\"\n\nThe \"standard\" view of climate change has come to be defined by the reports of the IPCC, which is supported by many other science academies and scientific organizations. In 2001, sixteen of the world's national science academies made a joint statement on climate change, and gave their support for the IPCC.\n\nOpponents have generally attacked either the IPCC's processes, people or the Synthesis and Executive summaries; the full reports attract less attention. Some of the controversy and criticism has originated from experts invited by the IPCC to submit reports or serve on its panels. For example, Richard Lindzen has publicly dissented from IPCC positions.\n\nChristopher Landsea, a hurricane researcher, said of \"the part of the IPCC to which my expertise is relevant\" that \"I personally cannot in good faith continue to contribute to a process that I view as both being motivated by pre-conceived agendas and being scientifically unsound,\" because of comments made at a press conference by Kevin Trenberth of which Landsea disapproved. Trenberth said \"Landsea's comments were not correct\"; the IPCC replied \"individual scientists can do what they wish in their own rights, as long as they are not saying anything on behalf of the IPCC\" and offered to include Landsea in the review phase of the AR4. Roger Pielke, Jr. commented \"Both Landsea and Trenberth can and should feel vindicated... the IPCC accurately reported the state of scientific understandings of tropical cyclones and climate change in its recent summary for policy makers.\"\n\nIn 2005, the House of Lords Economics Committee wrote, \"We have some concerns about the objectivity of the IPCC process, with some of its emissions scenarios and summary documentation apparently influenced by political considerations.\" It doubted the high emission scenarios and said that the IPCC had \"played-down\" what the committee called \"some positive aspects of global warming\". The main statements of the House of Lords Economics Committee were rejected in the response made by the United Kingdom government and by the Stern Review.\n\nSpeaking to the difficulty of establishing scientific consensus on the precise extent of human action on climate change, John Christy, a contributing author, wrote:\n\nOn 10 December 2008, a report was released by the U.S. Senate Committee on Environment and Public Works Minority members, under the leadership of the Senate's most vocal global warming skeptic Jim Inhofe. The timing of the report coincided with the UN global warming conference in Poznań, Poland. It says it summarizes scientific dissent from the IPCC. Many of its statements about the numbers of individuals listed in the report, whether they are actually scientists, and whether they support the positions attributed to them, have been disputed.\n\nWhile some critics have argued that the IPCC overstates likely global warming, others have made the opposite criticism. David Biello, writing in the Scientific American, argues that, because of the need to secure consensus among governmental representatives, the IPCC reports give conservative estimates of the likely extent and effects of global warming. \"Science\" editor Brooks Hanson states in a 2010 editorial: \"The IPCC reports have underestimated the pace of climate change while overestimating societies' abilities to curb greenhouse gas emissions.\" Climate scientist James E. Hansen argues that the IPCC's conservativeness seriously underestimates the risk of sea-level rise on the order of meters—enough to inundate many low-lying areas, such as the southern third of Florida. Roger A. Pielke Sr. has also stated \"Humans are significantly altering the global climate, but in a variety of diverse ways beyond the radiative effect of carbon dioxide. The IPCC assessments have been too conservative in recognizing the importance of these human climate forcings as they alter regional and global climate.\"\n\nHenderson-Sellers has collected comments from IPCC authors in a 2007 workshop revealing a number of concerns. She concluded, \"Climate change research entered a new and different regime with the publication of the IPCC Fourth Assessment Report. There is no longer any question about ‘whether’ human activities are changing the climate; instead research must tackle the urgent questions of: ‘how fast?’; ‘with what impacts?'; and ‘what responses are needed?’\"\n\nAttribution of recent climate change discusses the evidence for recent global warming. Correlation of and temperature is not part of this evidence. Nonetheless, one argument against global warming says that rising levels of carbon dioxide () and other greenhouse gases (GHGs) do not correlate with global warming.\n\nAs noted above, climate models are only able to simulate the temperature record of the past century when GHG forcing is included, being consistent with the findings of the IPCC which has stated that: \"Greenhouse gas forcing, largely the result of human activities, has very likely caused most of the observed global warming over the last 50 years\"\n\nThe \"standard\" set of scenarios for future atmospheric greenhouse gases are the IPCC SRES scenarios. The purpose of the range of scenarios is not to predict what exact course the future of emissions will take, but what it may take under a range of possible population, economic and societal trends. Climate models can be run using any of the scenarios as inputs to illustrate the different outcomes for climate change. No one scenario is officially preferred, but in practice the \"A1b\" scenario roughly corresponding to 1%/year growth in atmospheric is often used for modelling studies.\n\nThere is debate about the various scenarios for fossil fuel consumption. Global warming skeptic Fred Singer stated \"some good experts believe\" that atmospheric concentration will not double since economies are becoming less reliant on carbon.\n\nHowever, the Stern report,\nlike many other reports, notes the past correlation between emissions and economic growth and then extrapolates using a \"business as usual\" scenario to predict GDP growth and hence levels, concluding that:\n\nIncreasing scarcity of fossil fuels alone will not stop emissions growth in time. The stocks of hydrocarbons that are profitable to extract are more than enough to take the world to levels of well beyond 750 ppm with very dangerous consequences for climate change impacts.\nAccording to a 2006 paper from Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory, \"the earth would warm by 8 degrees Celsius (14.4 degrees Fahrenheit) if humans use the entire planet's available fossil fuels by the year 2300.\"\n\nOn 12 November 2015, NASA scientists reported that human-made carbon dioxide (CO) continues to increase above levels not seen in hundreds of thousands of years: currently, about half of the carbon dioxide released from the burning of fossil fuels remains in the atmosphere and is not absorbed by vegetation and the oceans.\n\nScientists opposing the mainstream scientific assessment of global warming express varied opinions concerning the cause of global warming. Some say only that it has not yet been ascertained whether humans are the primary cause of global warming; others attribute global warming to natural variation; ocean currents; increased solar activity or cosmic rays. The consensus position is that solar radiation may have increased by 0.12 W/m since 1750, compared to 1.6 W/m for the net anthropogenic forcing. The TAR said, \"The combined change in radiative forcing of the two major natural factors (solar variation and volcanic aerosols) is estimated to be negative for the past two, and possibly the past four, decades.\" The AR4 makes no direct assertions on the recent role of solar forcing, but the previous statement is consistent with the AR4's figure 4.\n\nA few studies say that the present level of solar activity is historically high as determined by sunspot activity and other factors. Solar activity could affect climate either by variation in the Sun's output or, more speculatively, by an indirect effect on the amount of cloud formation. Solanki and co-workers suggest that solar activity for the last 60 to 70 years may be at its highest level in 8,000 years, however they said \"that solar variability is unlikely to have been the dominant cause of the strong warming during the past three decades\", and concluded that \"at the most 30% of the strong warming since then can be of solar origin\". Muscheler \"et al.\" disagreed with the study, suggesting that other comparably high levels of activity have occurred several times in the last few thousand years.\nThey concluded that \"solar activity reconstructions tell us that only a minor fraction of the recent global warming can be explained by the variable Sun.\".\n\nAnother point of controversy is the correlation of temperature with solar variation.\n\nMike Lockwood and Claus Fröhlich reject the statement that the warming observed in the global mean surface temperature record since about 1850 is the result of solar variations. Lockwood and Fröhlich conclude, \"the observed rapid rise in global mean temperatures seen after 1985 cannot be ascribed to solar variability, whichever of the mechanisms is invoked and no matter how much the solar variation is amplified.\"\n\nThe hiatus in warming from the 1940s to 1960s is generally attributed to cooling effect of sulphate aerosols. More recently, this forcing has (relatively) declined, which may have enhanced warming, though the effect is regionally varying. See global dimming. Another example of this is in Ruckstuhl's paper who found a 60% reduction in aerosol concentrations over Europe causing solar brightening:\n\n[...] the direct aerosol effect had an approximately five times larger impact on climate forcing than the indirect aerosol and other cloud effects. The overall aerosol and cloud induced surface climate forcing is ~ 1 W m decade and has most probably strongly contributed to the recent rapid warming in Europe.\n\nThere have been attempts to raise public controversy over the accuracy of the instrumental temperature record on the basis of the urban heat island effect, the quality of the surface station network, and assertions that there have been unwarranted adjustments to the temperature record.\n\nWeather stations that are used to compute global temperature records are not evenly distributed over the planet, and their distribution has changed over time. There were a small number of weather stations in the 1850s, and the number didn't reach the current 3000+ until the 1951 to 1990 period\n\nThe 2001 IPCC Third Assessment Report (TAR) acknowledged that the urban heat island is an important \"local\" effect, but cited analyses of historical data indicating that the effect of the urban heat island on the \"global\" temperature trend is no more than 0.05 °C (0.09 °F) degrees through 1990.\nPeterson (2003) found no difference between the warming observed in urban and rural areas.\n\nParker (2006) found that there was no difference in warming between calm and windy nights. Since the urban heat island effect is strongest for calm nights and is weak or absent on windy nights, this was taken as evidence that global temperature trends are not significantly contaminated by urban effects. Pielke and Matsui published a paper disagreeing with Parker's conclusions.\n\nIn 2005, Roger A. Pielke and Stephen McIntyre criticized the US instrumental temperature record and adjustments to it, and Pielke and others criticized the poor quality siting of a number of weather stations in the United States. In 2007, Anthony Watts began a volunteer effort to photographically document the siting quality of these stations. The \"Journal of Geophysical Research – Atmospheres\" subsequently published a study by Menne et al. which examined the record of stations picked out by Watts' Surfacestations.org and found that, if anything, the poorly sited stations showed a slight cool bias rather than the warm bias which Watts had anticipated.\n\nThe Berkeley Earth Surface Temperature group carried out an independent assessment of land temperature records, which examined issues raised by skeptics, such as the urban heat island effect, poor station quality, and the risk of data selection bias. The preliminary results, made public in October 2011, found that these factors had not biased the results obtained by NOAA, the Hadley Centre together with the Climatic Research Unit (HadCRUT) and NASA's GISS in earlier studies. The group also confirmed that over the past 50 years the land surface warmed by 0.911 °C, and their results closely matched those obtained from these earlier studies. The four papers they had produced had been submitted for peer review.\n\nGeneral circulation models and basic physical considerations predict that in the tropics the temperature of the troposphere should increase more rapidly than the temperature of the surface. A 2006 report to the U.S. Climate Change Science Program noted that models and observations agreed on this amplification for monthly and interannual time scales but not for decadal time scales in most observed data sets. Improved measurement and analysis techniques have reconciled this discrepancy: corrected buoy and satellite surface temperatures are slightly cooler and corrected satellite and radiosonde measurements of the tropical troposphere are slightly warmer. Satellite temperature measurements show that tropospheric temperatures are increasing with \"rates similar to those of the surface temperature\", leading the IPCC to conclude that this discrepancy is reconciled.\n\nThere has been a public dispute regarding the apparent contradiction in the observed behavior of Antarctica, as opposed to the global rise in temperatures measured elsewhere in the world. This became part of the public debate in the global warming controversy, particularly between advocacy groups of both sides in the public arena, as well as the popular media.\n\nIn contrast to the popular press, there is no evidence of a corresponding controversy in the scientific community. Observations unambiguously show the Antarctic Peninsula to be warming. The trends elsewhere show both warming and cooling but are smaller and dependent on season and the timespan over which the trend is computed. A study released in 2009, combined historical weather station data with satellite measurements to deduce past temperatures over large regions of the continent, and these temperatures indicate an overall warming trend. One of the paper's authors stated \"We now see warming is taking place on all seven of the earth's continents in accord with what models predict as a response to greenhouse gases.\" According to 2011 paper by Ding, et al., \"The Pacific sector of Antarctica, including both the Antarctic Peninsula and continental West Antarctica, has experienced substantial warming in the past 30 years.\"\n\nThis controversy began with the misinterpretation of the results of a 2002 paper by Doran et al., which found \"Although previous reports suggest slight recent continental warming, our spatial analysis of Antarctic meteorological data demonstrates a net cooling on the Antarctic continent between 1966 and 2000, particularly during summer and autumn.\" Later the controversy was popularized by Michael Crichton's 2004 fiction novel State of Fear, who advocated skepticism in global warming. This novel has a docudrama plot based upon the idea that there is a deliberately alarmist conspiracy behind global warming activism. One of the characters argues \"data show that one relatively small area called the Antarctic Peninsula is melting and calving huge icebergs... but the continent as a whole is getting colder, and the ice is getting thicker.\" As a basis for this plot twist, Crichton cited the peer reviewed scientific article by Doran, et al. Peter Doran, the lead author of the paper cited by Crichton, stated \"... our results have been misused as 'evidence' against global warming by Crichton in his novel 'State of Fear'... 'Our study did find that 58 percent of Antarctica cooled from 1966 to 2000. But during that period, the rest of the continent was warming. And climate models created since our paper was published have suggested a link between the lack of significant warming in Antarctica and the ozone hole over that continent.\"\n\nAs defined by the IPCC, climate sensitivity is the \"equilibrium temperature rise that would occur for a doubling of concentration above pre-industrial levels\". In its 2007 Fourth Assessment Report, IPCC said that climate sensitivity is \"likely to be in the range 2 to 4.5 °C with a best estimate of about 3 °C\".\n\nUsing a combination of surface temperature history and ocean heat content, Stephen E. Schwartz has proposed an estimate of climate sensitivity of 1.9 ± 1.0 K for doubled ., revised upwards from 1.1 ± 0.5 K. Grant Foster, James Annan, Gavin Schmidt, and Michael E. Mann argue that there are errors in both versions of Schwartz's analysis. Petr Chylek and co-authors have also proposed low climate sensitivity to doubled , estimated to be 1.6 K ± 0.4 K.\n\nIn January 2013 widespread publicity was given to work led by Terje Berntsen of the University of Oslo, Julia Hargreaves of the Research Institute for Global Change in Yokohama, and Nic Lewis, an independent climate scientist, which reportedly found lower climate sensitivities than IPCC estimates and the suggestion that there is a 90% probability that doubling emissions will increase temperatures by lower values than those estimated by the climate models used by the IPCC was featured in news outlets including \"The Economist\". This premature announcement came from a preliminary news release about a study which had not yet been peer reviewed. The Center for International Climate and Environmental Research, Oslo (CICERO) issued a statement that they were involved with the relevant research project, and the news story was based on a report submitted to the research council which included both published and unpublished material. The highly publicised figures came from work still undergoing peer review, and CICERO would wait until they had been published in a journal before disseminating the results.\n\nIn 2001, Richard Lindzen proposed a system of compensating meteorological processes involving clouds that tend to stabilize climate change; he tagged this the \"Iris hypothesis, or \"Infrared Iris\". This work has been discussed in a number of papers\n\nRoy Spencer \"et al.\" suggested \"a net reduction in radiative input into the ocean-atmosphere system\" in tropical intraseasonal oscillations \"may potentially support\" the idea of an \"Iris\" effect, although they point out that their work is concerned with much shorter time scales.\n\nOther analyses have found that the iris effect is a \"positive\" feedback rather than the negative feedback proposed by Lindzen.\n\nJames Hansen's 1984 climate model projections versus observed temperatures are updated each year by Dr Mikako Sato of Columbia University. The RealClimate website provides an annual update comparing both Hansen's 1988 model projections and the IPCC Fourth Assessment Report (AR4) climate model projections with observed temperatures recorded by GISS and HadCRUT. The measured temperatures show continuing global warming.\n\nConventional projections of future temperature rises depend on estimates of future anthropogenic GHG emissions (see SRES), those positive and negative climate change feedbacks that have so far been incorporated into the models, and the climate sensitivity. Models referenced by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) predict that global temperatures are likely to increase by 1.1 to 6.4 °C (2.0 to 11.5 °F) between 1990 and 2100. Others have proposed that temperature increases may be higher than IPCC estimates. One theory is that the climate may reach a \"tipping point\" where positive feedback effects lead to runaway global warming; such feedbacks include decreased reflection of solar radiation as sea ice melts, exposing darker seawater, and the potential release of large volumes of methane from thawing permafrost. In 1959, Dr. Bert Bolin, in a speech to the National Academy of Sciences, predicted that by the year 2000, there would be a 25% increase in carbon dioxide in the atmosphere compared to the levels in 1859. The actual increase by 2000 was about 29%.\n\nDavid Orrell or Henk Tennekes say that climate change cannot be accurately predicted. Orrell says that the range of future increase in temperature suggested by the IPCC rather represents a social consensus in the climate community, but adds \"we are having a dangerous effect on the climate\".\n\nA 2007 study by David Douglass and coworkers, concluded that the 22 most commonly used global climate models used by the IPCC were unable to accurately predict accelerated warming in the troposphere although they did match actual surface warming, concluding \"projections of future climate based on these models should be viewed with much caution\". This result went against a similar study of 19 models which found that discrepancies between model predictions and actual temperature were likely due to measurement errors.\n\nIn a NASA report published in January 2013, Hansen and Sato noted \"the 5-year mean global temperature has been flat for a decade, which we interpret as a combination of natural variability and a slowdown in the growth rate of the net climate forcing.\" Ed Hawkins, of the University of Reading, stated that the \"surface temperatures since 2005 are already at the low end of the range of projections derived from 20 climate models. If they remain flat, they will fall outside the models' range within a few years.\" Using the long-term temperature trends for the earth scientists and statisticians conclude that it continues to warm through time.\n\nThe IPCC states it has increased confidence in forecasts coming from General Circulation Models or GCMs. Chapter 8 of AR4 reads:\n\"There is considerable confidence that climate models provide credible quantitative estimates of future climate change, particularly at continental scales and above. This confidence comes from the foundation of the models in accepted physical principles and from their ability to reproduce observed features of current climate and past climate changes. Confidence in model estimates is higher for some climate variables (e.g., temperature) than for others (e.g., precipitation). Over several decades of development, models have consistently provided a robust and unambiguous picture of significant climate warming in response to increasing greenhouse gases.\"\n\nCertain scientists, skeptics and otherwise, believe this confidence in the models' ability to predict future climate is not earned.\n\nFollowing the (then) record low of the arctic sea ice extend in 2007, Mark Serreze, the director of US National Snow and Ice Data Center, stated \"If you asked me a couple of years ago when the Arctic could lose all of its ice then I would have said 2100, or 2070 maybe. But now I think that 2030 is a reasonable estimate.\"\nIn 2012, during another record low, Peter Wadhams of Cambridge University predicted a possible final collapse of Arctic sea ice in summer months around 2016.\n\nAntarctic and Arctic sea ice extent are available on a daily basis from the National Snow & Ice Data Center.\n\nScientific journals and funding agencies generally require authors of peer-reviewed research to provide information on archives of data and share sufficient data and methods necessary for a scientific expert on the topic to reproduce the work.\n\nIn political controversy over the 1998 and 1999 historic temperature reconstructions widely publicised as the \"hockey stick graphs\", Mann, Bradley and Hughes as authors of the studies were sent letters on 23 June 2005 from Rep. Joe Barton, chairman of the House Committee on Energy and Commerce and Ed Whitfield, Chairman of the Subcommittee on Oversight and Investigations, demanding full records on the research.\nThe letters told the scientist to provide not just data and methods, but also personal information about their finances and careers, information about grants provided to the institutions they had worked for, and the exact computer codes used to generate their results.\n\nSherwood Boehlert, chairman of the House Science Committee, told his fellow Republican Joe Barton it was a \"misguided and illegitimate investigation\" seemingly intended to \"intimidate scientists rather than to learn from them, and to substitute congressional political review for scientific review\". The U.S. National Academy of Sciences (NAS) president Ralph J. Cicerone wrote to Barton proposing that the NAS should appoint an independent panel to investigate. Barton dismissed this offer.\n\nOn 15 July, Mann wrote giving his detailed response to Barton and Whitfield. He emphasised that the full data and necessary methods information was already publicly available in full accordance with National Science Foundation (NSF) requirements, so that other scientists had been able to reproduce their work. NSF policy was that computer codes are considered the intellectual property of researchers and are not subject to disclosure, but notwithstanding these property rights, the program used to generate the original MBH98 temperature reconstructions had been made available at the Mann et al. public FTP site.\n\nMany scientists protested about Barton's demands. Alan I. Leshner wrote to him on behalf of the American Association for the Advancement of Science stating that the letters gave \"the impression of a search for some basis on which to discredit these particular scientists and findings, rather than a search for understanding\", He stated that Mann, Bradley and Hughes had given out their full data and descriptions of methods.\nA \"Washington Post\" editorial on 23 July which described the investigation as harassment quoted Bradley as saying it was \"intrusive, far-reaching and intimidating\", and Alan I. Leshner of the AAAS describing it as unprecedented in the 22 years he had been a government scientist; he thought it could \"have a chilling effect on the willingness of people to work in areas that are politically relevant\". Congressman Boehlert said the investigation was as \"at best foolhardy\" with the tone of the letters showing the committee's inexperience in relation to science.\n\nBarton was given support by global warming sceptic Myron Ebell of the Competitive Enterprise Institute, who said \"We've always wanted to get the science on trial ... we would like to figure out a way to get this into a court of law,\" and \"this could work\". In his \"Junk Science\" column on Fox News, Steven Milloy said Barton's inquiry was reasonable. In September 2005 David Legates alleged in a newspaper op-ed that the issue showed climate scientists not abiding by data access requirements and suggested that legislators might ultimately take action to enforce them.\n\nIn the U.S. global warming is often a partisan political issue. Republicans tend to oppose action against a threat that they regard as unproven, while Democrats tend to support actions that they believe will reduce global warming and its effects through the control of greenhouse gas emissions. \nClimatologist Kevin E. Trenberth stated:\n\nThe SPM [Summary for policymakers] was approved line by line by governments[...] The argument here is that the scientists determine what can be said, but the governments determine how it can best be said. Negotiations occur over wording to ensure accuracy, balance, clarity of message, and relevance to understanding and policy. The IPCC process is dependent on the good will of the participants in producing a balanced assessment. However, in Shanghai, it appeared that there were attempts to blunt, and perhaps obfuscate, the messages in the report, most notably by Saudi Arabia. This led to very protracted debates over wording on even bland and what should be uncontroversial text... The most contentious paragraph in the IPCC (2001) SPM was the concluding one on attribution. After much debate, the following was carefully crafted: \"In the light of new evidence, and taking into account the remaining uncertainties, most of the observed warming over the last 50 years is likely to have been due to the increase in greenhouse-gas concentrations.\"\n\nAs more evidence has become available over the existence of global warming debate has moved to further controversial issues, including:\n\n\nThe single largest issue is the importance of a few degrees rise in temperature:\nMost people say, \"A few degrees? So what? If I change my thermostat a few degrees, I'll live fine.\" ... [The] point is that one or two degrees is about the experience that we have had in the last 10,000 years, the era of human civilization. There haven't been—globally averaged, we're talking—fluctuations of more than a degree or so. So we're actually getting into uncharted territory from the point of view of the relatively benign climate of the last 10,000 years, if we warm up more than a degree or two. (Stephen H. Schneider)\n\nThe other point that leads to major controversy—because it could have significant economic impacts—is whether action (usually, restrictions on the use of fossil fuels to reduce carbon-dioxide emissions) should be taken now, or in the near future; and whether those restrictions would have any meaningful effect on global temperature.\n\nBecause of the economic ramifications of such restrictions, there are those, including the Cato Institute, a libertarian think tank, who argue that the negative economic effects of emission controls outweigh the environmental benefits. They state that even if global warming is caused solely by the burning of fossil fuels, restricting their use would have more damaging effects on the world economy than the increases in global temperature.\n\nThe linkage between coal, electricity, and economic growth in the United States is as clear as it can be. And it is required for the way we live, the way we work, for our economic success, and for our future. Coal-fired electricity generation. It is necessary.(Fred Palmer, President of Western Fuels Association)\n\nConversely, others argue that early action to reduce emissions would help avoid much greater economic costs later, and would reduce the risk of catastrophic, irreversible change. In his December 2006 book, \"Hell and High Water\", Joseph J. Romm\ndiscusses the urgency to act and the sad fact that America is refusing to do so...\n\nOn a local or regional level, some specific effects of global warming might be considered beneficial.\n\nCouncil on Foreign Relations senior fellow Walter Russell Mead argues that the 2009 Copenhagen Summit failed because environmentalists have changed from \"Bambi to Godzilla\". According to Mead, environmentalist used to represent the skeptical few who made valid arguments against big government programs which tried to impose simple but massive solutions on complex situations. Environmentalists' more recent advocacy for big economic and social intervention against global warming, according to Mead, has made them, \"the voice of the establishment, of the tenured, of the technocrats\" and thus has lost them the support of a public which is increasingly skeptical of global warming.\n\nVarious campaigns such as 350.org and many Greenpeace projects have been started in an effort to push the world's leaders towards changing laws and policies that would effectively reduce the world's carbon emissions and use of non-renewable energy resources.\n\nThe Kyoto Protocol is the most prominent international agreement on climate change, and is also highly controversial. Some argue that it goes too far or not nearly far enough in restricting emissions of greenhouse gases. Another area of controversy is the fact that China and India, the world's two most populous countries, both ratified the protocol but are not required to reduce or even limit the growth of carbon emissions under the present agreement even though when listed by greenhouse gas emissions per capita, they have rankings of 121st largest per capita emitter at 3.9 Tonnes of e and 162nd largest per capita emitter at 1.8 Tonnes of e respectively, compared with for example the U.S. at position of the 14th largest per capita e emitter at 22.9 Tonnes of e. Nevertheless, China is the world's second largest producer of greenhouse gas emissions, and India 4th (see: countries by greenhouse emissions). Various predictions see China overtaking the US in total greenhouse emissions between late 2007 and 2010, and according to many other estimates, this already occurred in 2006.\n\nAdditionally, high costs of decreasing emissions may cause significant production to move to countries that are not covered under the treaty, such as India and China, says Fred Singer. As these countries are less energy efficient, this scenario is said to cause additional carbon emissions.\n\nIn May 2010 the Hartwell Paper was published by the London School of Economics in collaboration with the University of Oxford. This paper was written by 14 academics from various disciplines in the sciences and humanities, and also some policies thinkers, and they argued that the Kyoto Protocol crashed in late 2009 and \"has failed to produce any discernable real world reductions in emissions of greenhouse gases in fifteen years.\" They argued that this failure opened an opportunity to set climate policy free from Kyoto and the paper advocates a controversial and piecemeal approach to decarbonization of the global economy. The Hartwell paper proposes, \"the organising principle of our effort should be the raising up of human dignity via three overarching objectives: ensuring energy access for all; ensuring that we develop in a manner that does not undermine the essential functioning of the Earth system; ensuring that our societies are adequately equipped to withstand the risks and dangers that come from all the vagaries of climate, whatever their cause may be\".\n\nThe only major developed nation which has signed but not ratified the Kyoto protocol is the US (see signatories). The countries with no official position on Kyoto are mainly African countries with underdeveloped scientific infrastructure or are oil producers .\n\nThe Global Climate Coalition was an industry coalition that funded several scientists who expressed skepticism about global warming. In the year 2000, several members left the coalition when they became the target of a national divestiture campaign run by John Passacantando and Phil Radford at Ozone Action. According to \"The New York Times\", when Ford Motor Company was the first company to leave the coalition, it was \"the latest sign of divisions within heavy industry over how to respond to global warming\". After that, between December, 1999 and early March, 2000, the GCC was deserted by Daimler-Chrysler, Texaco, energy firm the Southern Company and General Motors. The Global Climate Coalition closed in 2002, or in their own words, 'deactivated'.\n\nDocuments obtained by Greenpeace under the US Freedom of Information Act show that the Charles G. Koch Foundation gave climate change writer Willie Soon two grants totaling $175,000 in 2005/6 and again in 2010. Multiple grants to Soon from the American Petroleum Institute between 2001 and 2007, totalled $274,000, and from ExxonMobil totalled $335,000 between 2005 and 2010. Other coal and oil industry sources which funded him include the Mobil Foundation, the Texaco Foundation and the Electric Power Research Institute. Soon, acknowledging that he received this money, stated unequivocally that he has \"never been motivated by financial reward in any of my scientific research\". In February 2015, Greenpeace disclosed papers documenting that Soon failed to disclose to academic journals funding including more than $1.2 million from fossil fuel industry related interests including ExxonMobil, the American Petroleum Institute, the Charles G. Koch Charitable Foundation and the Southern Company. To investigate how widespread such hidden funding was, senators Barbara Boxer, Edward Markey and Sheldon Whitehouse wrote to a number of companies. Koch general counsel refused the request and said it would infringe the company's first amendment rights.\n\nThe Greenpeace research project ExxonSecrets, and George Monbiot writing in \"The Guardian\", as well as various academics, have linked several skeptical scientists—Fred Singer, Fred Seitz and Patrick Michaels—to organizations funded by ExxonMobil and Philip Morris for the purpose of promoting global warming skepticism. These organizations include the Cato Institute and the Heritage Foundation. Similarly, groups employing global warming skeptics, such as the George C. Marshall Institute, have been criticized for their ties to fossil fuel companies.\n\nOn 2 February 2007, \"The Guardian\" stated that Kenneth Green, a Visiting Scholar with AEI, had sent letters to scientists in the UK and the U.S., offering US$10,000 plus travel expenses and other incidental payments in return for essays with the purpose of \"highlight[ing] the strengths and weaknesses of the IPCC process\", specifically regarding the IPCC Fourth Assessment Report.\n\nA furor was raised when it was revealed that the Intermountain Rural Electric Association (an energy cooperative that draws a significant portion of its electricity from coal-burning power plants) donated $100,000 to Patrick Michaels and his group, New Hope Environmental Services, and solicited additional private donations from its members.\n\nThe Union of Concerned Scientists produced a report titled 'Smoke, Mirrors & Hot Air', that criticizes ExxonMobil for \"underwriting the most sophisticated and most successful disinformation campaign since the tobacco industry\" and for \"funnelling about $16 million between 1998 and 2005 to a network of ideological and advocacy organizations that manufacture uncertainty on the issue\". In 2006, Exxon said that it was no longer going to fund these groups though that statement has been challenged by Greenpeace.\n\nThe Center for the Study of Carbon Dioxide and Global Change, a skeptic group, when confronted about the funding of a video they put together ($250,000 for \"The Greening of Planet Earth\" from an oil company) stated, \"We applaud Western Fuels for their willingness to publicize a side of the story that we believe to be far more correct than what at one time was 'generally accepted'. But does this mean that they fund The Center? Maybe it means that we fund them!\"\n\nDonald Kennedy, editor-in-chief of \"Science\", has said that skeptics such as Michaels are lobbyists more than researchers, and \"I don't think it's unethical any more than most lobbying is unethical,\" he said. He said donations to skeptics amounts to \"trying to get a political message across\".\n\nGlobal warming skeptic Reid Bryson said in June 2007, \"There is a lot of money to be made in this... If you want to be an eminent scientist you have to have a lot of grad students and a lot of grants. You can't get grants unless you say, 'Oh global warming, yes, yes, carbon dioxide'.\" Similar positions have been advanced by University of Alabama, Huntsville climate scientist Roy Spencer, Spencer's University of Alabama, Huntsville colleague and IPCC contributor John Christy, University of London biogeographer Philip Stott, Accuracy in Media, and Ian Plimer in his 2009 book \"Heaven and Earth — Global Warming: The Missing Science\".\n\nRichard Lindzen, the Alfred P. Sloan Professor of Meteorology at MIT, said, \"[in] the winter of 1989 Reginald Newell, a professor of meteorology [at MIT], lost National Science Foundation funding for data analyses that were failing to show net warming over the past century.\" Lindzen also suggested that four other scientists \"apparently\" lost their funding or positions after questioning the scientific underpinnings of global warming. Lindzen himself has been the recipient of money from energy interests such as OPEC and the Western Fuels Association, including \"$2,500 a day for his consulting services\", as well as funding from US federal sources including the National Science Foundation, the Department of Energy, and NASA.\n\nIn recent years some skeptics have changed their positions regarding global warming. Ronald Bailey, author of \"Global Warming and Other Eco-Myths\" (published by the Competitive Enterprise Institute in 2002), stated in 2005, \"Anyone still holding onto the idea that there is no global warming ought to hang it up.\" By 2007, he wrote \"Details like sea level rise will continue to be debated by researchers, but if the debate over whether or not humanity is contributing to global warming wasn't over before, it is now... as the new IPCC Summary makes clear, climate change Pollyannaism is no longer looking very tenable.\"\n\n\"There are alternatives to its [the climate-change crusade's] insistence that the only appropriate policy response is steep and immediate emissions reductions... a greenhouse-gas-emissions cap ultimately would constrain energy production. A sensible climate policy would emphasize building resilience into our capacity to adapt to climate changes... we should consider strategies of adaptation to a changing climate. A rise in the sea level need not be the end of the world, as the Dutch have taught us.\" says Steven F. Hayward of American Enterprise Institute, a conservative think-tank. Hayward also advocates the use of \"orbiting mirrors to rebalance the amounts of solar radiation different parts of the earth receive\"—the space sunshade example of so-called geoengineering for solar radiation management.\n\nIn 2001, Richard Lindzen, asked whether it was necessary to try to reduce emissions, said that responses needed to be prioritised. \"You can't just say, 'No matter what the cost, and no matter how little the benefit, we'll do this'. If we truly believe in warming, then we've already decided we're going to adjust...The reason we adjust to things far better than Bangladesh is that we're richer. Wouldn't you think it makes sense to make sure we're as robust and wealthy as possible? And that the poor of the world are also as robust and wealthy as possible?\"\n\nOthers argue that if developing nations reach the wealth level of the United States this could greatly increase emissions and consumption of fossil fuels. Large developing nations such as India and China are predicted to be major emitters of greenhouse gases in the next few decades as their economies grow.\n\nThe conservative National Center for Policy Analysis whose \"Environmental Task Force\" contains a number of climate change skeptics including Sherwood Idso and S. Fred Singer\nsays, \"The growing consensus on climate change policies is that adaptation will protect present and future generations from climate-sensitive risks far more than efforts to restrict emissions.\"\n\nThe adaptation-only plan is also endorsed by oil companies like ExxonMobil, \"ExxonMobil's plan appears to be to stay the course and try to adjust when changes occur. The company's plan is one that involves adaptation, as opposed to leadership,\"\nsays this Ceres report.\n\nGregg Easterbrook characterized himself as having \"a long record of opposing alarmism\". In 2006, he stated, \"based on the data I'm now switching sides regarding global warming, from skeptic to convert.\"\n\nThe George W. Bush administration also voiced support for an adaptation-only policy in the US in 2002. \"In a stark shift for the Bush administration, the United States has sent a climate report [\"U.S. Climate Action Report 2002\"] to the United Nations detailing specific and far-reaching effects it says global warming will inflict on the American environment. In the report, the administration also for the first time places most of the blame for recent global warming on human actions—mainly the burning of fossil fuels that send heat-trapping greenhouse gases into the atmosphere.\" The report however \"does not propose any major shift in the administration's policy on greenhouse gases. Instead it recommends adapting to inevitable changes instead of making rapid and drastic reductions in greenhouse gases to limit warming.\" This position apparently precipitated a similar shift in emphasis at the COP 8 climate talks in New Delhi several months later, \"The shift satisfies the Bush administration, which has fought to avoid mandatory cuts in emissions for fear it would harm the economy. 'We're welcoming a focus on more of a balance on adaptation versus mitigation', said a senior American negotiator in New Delhi. 'You don't have enough money to do everything.'\" The White House emphasis on adaptation was not well received however:\n\nSome find this shift and attitude disingenuous and indicative of an inherent bias against prevention (i.e. reducing emissions/consumption) and for the prolonging of profits to the oil industry at the expense of the environment. \"Now that the dismissal of climate change is no longer fashionable, the professional deniers are trying another means of stopping us from taking action. It would be cheaper, they say, to wait for the impacts of climate change and then adapt to them\" says writer and environmental activist George Monbiot\nin an article addressing the supposed economic hazards of addressing climate change. Others argue that adaptation alone will not be sufficient.\nSee also Copenhagen Consensus.\n\nThough not emphasized to the same degree as mitigation, adaptation to a climate certain to change has been included as a necessary component in the discussion as early as 1992,\nand has been all along.\nHowever it was not to the \"exclusion\", advocated by the skeptics, of \"preventative\" mitigation efforts, and therein, say carbon cutting proponents, lies the difference.\n\nAnother highly debated potential climate change mitigation strategy is Cap and Trade due to its direct relationship with the economy.\n\nIn November 2016, the Paris Agreement went into effect.\n\nMany climate scientists state that they are put under enormous pressure to distort or hide any scientific results which suggest that human activity is to blame for global warming. A survey of climate scientists which was reported to the US House Oversight and Government Reform Committee in 2007, noted \"Nearly half of all respondents perceived or personally experienced pressure to eliminate the words 'climate change', 'global warming' or other similar terms from a variety of communications.\" These scientists were pressured to tailor their reports on global warming to fit the Bush administration's climate change scepticism. In some cases, this occurred at the request of former oil-industry lobbyist Phil Cooney, who worked for the American Petroleum Institute before becoming chief of staff at the White House Council on Environmental Quality (he resigned in 2005, before being hired by ExxonMobil). In June 2008, a report by NASA's Office of the Inspector General concluded that NASA staff appointed by the White House had censored and suppressed scientific data on global warming in order to protect the Bush administration from controversy close to the 2004 presidential election.\n\nU.S. officials, such as Philip Cooney, have repeatedly edited scientific reports from US government scientists, many of whom, such as Thomas Knutson, have been ordered to refrain from discussing climate change and related topics. Attempts to suppress scientific information on global warming and other issues have been described by journalist Chris Mooney in his book \"The Republican War on Science\".\n\nClimate scientist James E. Hansen, director of NASA's Goddard Institute for Space Studies, wrote in a widely cited \"New York Times\" article\nin 2006, that his superiors at the agency were trying to \"censor\" information \"going out to the public\". NASA denied this, saying that it was merely requiring that scientists make a distinction between personal, and official government, views in interviews conducted as part of work done at the agency. Several scientists working at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration have made similar complaints; once again, government officials said they were enforcing long-standing policies requiring government scientists to clearly identify personal opinions as such when participating in public interviews and forums.\n\nThe BBC's long-running current affairs series \"Panorama\" recently investigated the issue, and was told, \"scientific reports about global warming have been systematically changed and suppressed.\"\n\nScientists who agree with the consensus view have sometimes expressed concerns over what they view as sensationalism of global warming by interest groups and the press. For example, Mike Hulme, director of the Tyndall Centre for Climate Research, wrote how increasing use of pejorative terms like \"catastrophic\", \"chaotic\" and \"irreversible\", had altered the public discourse around climate change: \"This discourse is now characterised by phrases such as 'climate change is worse than we thought', that we are approaching 'irreversible tipping in the Earth's climate', and that we are 'at the point of no return'. I have found myself increasingly chastised by climate change campaigners when my public statements and lectures on climate change have not satisfied their thirst for environmental drama and exaggerated rhetoric.\"\n\nAccording to an Associated Press release on 30 January 2007,\n\nClimate scientists at seven government agencies say they have been subjected to political pressure aimed at downplaying the threat of global warming.\n\nThe groups presented a survey that shows two in five of the 279 climate scientists who responded to a questionnaire complained that some of their scientific papers had been edited in a way that changed their meaning. Nearly half of the 279 said in response to another question that at some point they had been told to delete reference to \"global warming\" or \"climate change\" from a report.\n\nCritics writing in \"The Wall Street Journal\" editorial page state that the survey\nwas itself unscientific.\n\nIn addition to the pressure from politicians, many prominent scientists working on climate change issues have reported increasingly severe harassment from members of the public. The harassment has taken several forms. The US FBI told ABC News that it was looking into a spike in threatening emails sent to climate scientists, while a white supremacist website posted pictures of several climate scientists with the word \"Jew\" next to each image. One climate scientist interviewed by ABC News had a dead animal dumped on his doorstep and now frequently has to travel with bodyguards.\n\nIn April 2010, Virginia Attorney General Ken Cuccinelli claimed that leading climate scientist Michael E. Mann had possibly violated state fraud laws, and without providing any evidence of wrongdoing, filed the Attorney General of Virginia's climate science investigation as a civil demand that the University of Virginia provide a wide range of records broadly related to five research grants Mann had obtained as an assistant professor at the university from 1999 to 2005. This litigation was widely criticized in the academic community as politically motivated and likely to have a chilling effect on future research. The university filed a court petition and the judge dismissed Cuccinelli's demand on the grounds that no justification had been shown for the investigation. Cuccinelli issued a revised subpoena, and appealed the case to the Virginia Supreme Court which ruled in March 2012 that Cuccinelli did not have the authority to make these demands. The outcome was hailed as a victory for academic freedom.\n\nExxon Mobil is also notorious for skewing scientific evidence through their private funding of scientific organizations. In 2002, Exxon Mobil contributed $10,000 to The Independent Institute and then $10,000 more in 2003. In 2003, The Independent Institute release a study that reported the evidence for imminent global warming found during the Clinton administration was based on now-dated satellite findings and wrote off the evidence and findings as a product of \"bad science\".\n\nThis is not the only consortium of skeptics that Exxon Mobil has supported financially. The George C. Marshall Institute received $630,000 in funding for climate change research from ExxonMobil between 1998 and 2005. Exxon Mobil also gave $472,000 in funding to The Board of Academic and Scientific Advisors for the Committee for a Constructive Tomorrow from 1998 to 2005. Dr. Frederick Seitz, well known as \"the godfather of global warming skepticism\", served as both Chairman Emeritus of The George C. Marshall Institute and a board member of the Committee for a Constructive Tomorrow from 1998 to 2005.\n\nSeveral lawsuits have been filed over global warming. For example, Massachusetts v. Environmental Protection Agency before the Supreme Court of the United States allowed the EPA to regulate greenhouse gases under the Clean Air Act. A similar approach was taken by California Attorney General Bill Lockyer who filed a lawsuit California v. General Motors Corp. to force car manufacturers to reduce vehicles' emissions of carbon dioxide. This lawsuit was found to lack legal merit and was tossed out. A third case, Comer v. Murphy Oil USA, Inc., a class action lawsuit filed by Gerald Maples, a trial attorney in Mississippi, in an effort to force fossil fuel and chemical companies to pay for damages caused by global warming. Described as a nuisance lawsuit, it was dismissed by District Court. However, the District Court's decision was overturned by the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit, which instructed the District Court to reinstate several of the plaintiffs' climate change-related claims on 22 October 2009. The Sierra Club sued the U.S. government over failure to raise automobile fuel efficiency standards, and thereby decrease carbon dioxide emissions.\n\nIn a lawsuit organized by activist organization Our Children's Trust, a group of plaintiffs aged 8–19 sued the U. S. Federal Government, claiming \"the government has known for decades that carbon dioxide (CO) pollution has been causing catastrophic climate change and has failed to take necessary action to curtail fossil fuel emissions.\" On April 8, 2016, U. S. Magistrate Judge Thomas Coffin denied defendant's motion to dismiss, arguing plaintiffs have standing to sue because they will be disproportionately affected by the alleged damages. \"The intractability of the debates before Congress and state legislatures and the alleged valuing of short term economic interest despite the cost to human life,\" argued Coffin, \"necessitates a need for the courts to evaluate the constitutional parameters of the action or inaction taken by the government\".\n\n\n\n"}

These works fulfill a wide variety of purposes often seen in government publications, primarily educating the public about government programs or lifestyle choices the government wants to encourage. Richard L. Graham examines and dissects the United States' government comics in \"Government Issue: Comics for the People, 1940s-2000s\".\n\nIn 1942, the Advertising Research Foundation conducted a study which found that \"for adults, the most widely read non-advertising feature in newspapers was the comic strip.\" In an effort to boost public support for ongoing foreign policies, the government looked to this study, and tried to persuade and suggest themes and ideas of soldiers and America as a whole, for artists to include in their weekly publications. Government officials understood that comics \"have the capacity to simplify even the most crucial civic issues and shape public opinion.\" Not being satisfied with the images found in local papers and national magazines, the government went a step farther and began publishing their own comics. The intentions behind these publications were to \"reinforce the government's expectations about the preferred cultural identity of the country.\" When examining government issued comics, it is important to realize that they give us an idea of the government's \"idealized or assumed 'American experience'.\" The themes and ideas found within the comics written and distributed by the government\n\"express the government's attempts to recognize and address the nation's attitudes and concerns.\"\n\nThese comics were mainly printed by federal agencies, but the government also commissioned works printed by Marvel, Harvey, and DC Comics.\nwith Munro Leaf, Geisel created an illustrated pamphlet for the army, which addressed the problems of malaria. Another famous artist commissioned by the government was Walt Disney. While Walt Disney Studios in California \"became extensive 'war plants', housing mountains of munitions\", artists were also developing characters for the comic \"Winter Draws On\", a manual of sorts, for the United States Army Air Forces.\n\nThese comics were \"distributed at schools, civic events, and recruiting offices; they were inserted in local newspapers and national magazines\", and can be found online on official government sites. The target audience for these comics included \"women, children, workers, ethnic groups, and immigrants.\"\ntactics is Bert the Turtle, \"likely the most famous pop icon of the Atomic Age\", from the comic Duck and Cover. \"The strategy behind Bert was to have a cartoon animal stand-in soften the blow when a topic was too scary to deal with directly.\"\n\n\"Coming Home\" is a graphic novel written by Sid Jacobson and Ernie Colón, published by the Ceridian Corporation in 2008. It is intended for educational purposes for military members, veterans, and family members. The novel centers around three main characters, each previously active-duty members in the military dealing with the transition of coming back home. The struggles of the transition from combat back to family life are shown through each of the character's individual struggles.\n\nIn \"Preparedness 101: Zombie Pandemic\", the CDC frames a real survival lesson in the entertaining zombie narrative. The story depicts a zombie apocalypse from the perspective of two residents of an unnamed town in southeast America, with an interlude showing the Center for Disease Control's attempts to counter the pandemic. The comic utilizes the zombie narrative's ability to \"fulfill survivalist fantasies.\"\n\n\n"}

{"id": "1113288", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1113288", "title": "Haman", "text": "Haman\n\nHaman (also known as Haman the Agagite המן האגגי, or Haman the evil המן הרשע) is the main antagonist in the Book of Esther, who, according to the Hebrew Bible, was a vizier in the Persian empire under King Ahasuerus, traditionally identified as Xerxes I. As his name indicates, Haman was a descendant of Agag, the king of the Amalekites, a people who were wiped out in certain areas by King Saul and David.\n\nHaman is described as the son of Hammedatha the Agagite, and his wife Amathlai. In the story, Haman instigates a plot to kill all of the Jews of ancient Persia. Haman attempts to convince Ahasuerus to order the killing of Mordecai and all the Jews of the lands he ruled. The plot is foiled by Queen Esther, the king's recent wife, who is herself a Jew. Haman is hanged from the gallows that had originally been built, on the advice of his wife Zeresh, to hang Mordecai. The dead bodies of his ten sons Parshandatha, Dalphon, Aspatha, Poratha, Adalia, Aridatha, Parmashta, Arisai, Aridai and Vaizatha (or Vajezatha), are also hanged after they die in battle trying to kill the Jews (Esther 9:5-14). Haman is upset that Mordecai refuses to bow down to him, as told in chapter 3:\n\n. . . and advanced him, and set his seat above all the princes who were with him. And all the king's servants, who were in the king's gate, bowed, and did obeisance to Haman; for the king had so commanded concerning him. But Mordecai did not bow, or do him obeisance. (Esther, 3:1-2)\n\nAnd when Haman saw that Mordecai did not bow or do him obedience, then Haman was full of wrath. But he disdained to lay hands on Mordecai alone; for they had told him of the people of Mordecai; so that Haman sought to destroy all the Jews who were throughout the whole kingdom of Ahasuerus, the people of Mordecai\". (Esther, 3:5-6)\n\nQueen Esther, learning that her people are in danger, risks her own life to spare the Jews living in Ancient Persia.\n\nKing Ahasuerus asked Queen Esther, \"Who is he? Where is the man who has dared to do such a thing?\" 6 Esther said, \"The adversary and enemy is this vile Haman.\" Then Haman was terrified before the king and queen. 7 The king got up in a rage, left his wine and went out into the palace garden. But Haman, realizing that the king had already decided his fate, stayed behind to beg Queen Esther for his life. 8 Just as the king returned from the palace garden to the banquet hall, Haman was falling on the couch where Esther was reclining. The king exclaimed, \"Will he even molest the queen while she is with me in the house?\" 9 As soon as the word left the king's mouth, they covered Haman's face.\n\n9 Then Harbona, one of the eunuchs attending the king, said, \"A gallows 50 feet [b] high stands by Haman's house. He had it made for Mordecai, who spoke up to help the king.\" 10 The king said, \"Hang him on it!\" 10 So they hanged Haman on the gallows he had prepared for Mordecai. Then the king's fury subsided.\" (Esther, 7:6-10)\nor\n9 Then Harbona, one of the king's eunuchs, said, \"Haman has set up a sharpened pole that stands seventy-five feet tall in his own courtyard. He intended to use it to impale Mordecai, the man who saved the king from assassination.\" \"Then impale Haman on it!\" the king ordered. 10 So they impaled Haman on the pole he had set up for Mordecai, and the king's anger subsided.\n\nIn Rabbinical tradition, Haman is considered to be an archetype of evil and persecutor of the Jews. Having attempted to exterminate the Jews of Persia, and rendering himself thereby their worst enemy, Haman naturally became the center of many Talmudic legends. Being at one time in extreme want, he sold himself as a slave to Mordechai (Meg. 15a). He was a barber at Kefar Karzum for the space of twenty-two years (ib. 16a). Haman had an idolatrous image embroidered on his garments, so that those who bowed to him at command of the king bowed also to the image (Esth. R. vii.).\n\nHaman was also an astrologer, and when he was about to fix the time for the genocide of the Jews he first cast lots to ascertain which was the most auspicious day of the week for that purpose. Each day, however, proved to be under some influence favorable to the Jews. He then sought to fix the month, but found that the same was true of each month; thus, Nisan was favorable to the Jews because of the Passover sacrifice; Iyyar, because of the small Passover. But when he arrived at Adar he found that its zodiacal sign was Pisces, and he said, \"Now I shall be able to swallow them as fish which swallow one another\" (Esth. R. vii.; Targ. Sheni iii.).\n\nHaman had 365 counselors, but the advice of none was so good as that of his wife, Zeresh. She induced Haman to build a gallows for Mordechai, assuring him that this was the only way in which he would be able to prevail over his enemy, for hitherto the just had always been rescued from every other kind of death. As God foresaw that Haman himself would be hanged on the gallows, He asked which tree would volunteer to serve as the instrument of death. Each tree, declaring that it was used for some holy purpose, objected to being soiled by the unclean body of Haman. Only the thorn-tree could find no excuse, and therefore offered itself for a gallows (Esth. R. ix.; Midr. Abba Gorion vii., ed. Buber, Wilna, 1886; in Targum Sheni this is narrated somewhat differently).\n\nHaman's lineage is given in the Targum Sheni as follows: \"Haman the son of Hammedatha the Agagite, son of Srach, son of Buza, son of Iphlotas, son of Dyosef, son of Dyosim, son of Prome, son of Ma'dei, son of Bla'akan, son of Intimros, son of Haridom, son of Sh'gar, son of Nigar, son of Farmashta, son of Vayezatha, (son of Agag, son of Sumkei,) son of Amalek, son of the concubine of Eliphaz, firstborn son of Esau\". There are apparently several generations omitted between Agag, who was executed by Samuel the prophet in the time of King Saul, and Amalek, who lived several hundred years earlier.\n\nHaman is mentioned by Josephus in his Antiquities of the Jews. Josephus' account of the story is drawn from the Septuagint translation of the Book of Esther and from other Greek and Jewish sources, some no longer extant.\n\nIn the LXX, Haman is called a \"Macedonian\" by Xerxes (see Esther 16:10). Scholars have had two different explanations for this naming. 1. Macedonian was used to replace the word \"Mede\", and emphasises this when he also says that there was no Persian blood in him. (In practice the Persians and the Medes co-ruled an empire, but there was great friction between them.) 2. Another opinion is that Xerxes was calling him a Macedonian Spy, due to his insistence on causing civil war within Persia between the Jews and the Persians.\n\nThe Jewish holiday of Purim commemorates the story of the deliverance of the Jews and the defeat of Haman. On that day, the Book of Esther is read publicly and much noise and tumult is raised at every mention of Haman′s name. A type of ratchet noisemaker called in Hebrew a \"ra'ashan\" (רעשן) (in Yiddish: \"grogger\" or \"hamandreyir\") is used to express disdain for Haman. Pastry known as Oznei Haman (אזני המן, lit. \"Ears of Haman\") (in Yiddish; Hamentashen) are traditionally eaten on this day.\n\nThe name has been equated with the Persian name \"Omanes\" (Old Persian: 𐎡𐎶𐎴𐎡𐏁 \"Imāniš\") recorded by Greek historians. Several etymologies have been proposed for it: it has been associated with the Persian word \"Hamayun\" meaning \"illustrious\". (naming dictionaries typically list it as meaning \"magnificent\"), or with the sacred drink Haoma. or with the Persian name Vohuman meaning \"good thoughts\". The 19th-century Bible critic Jensen associated it with the Elamite god Humban, a view dismissed by later scholars.Ahriman, a Zoroastrian spirit of destruction, has also been proposed as an etymon.\n\nHaman appeared in \"\" episode \"Queen Esther\". The 1994 animated television film \"Scooby-Doo! in Arabian Nights\" depicts Haman as an evil vizier to the sultan in its story segment, \"Aliyah-Din\". Mr. Lunt portrayed this biblical figure in the 2000 \"VeggieTales\" episode \"Esther the Girl who Became Queen\". In the \"South Park\" episode \"Jewbilee,\" Haman is depicted as the primary antagonist, trying to enter the mortal world once more to rule over the Jews.\n"}
{"id": "17770270", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=17770270", "title": "Homeless Workers' Movement", "text": "Homeless Workers' Movement\n\nThe Homeless Workers Movement (. MTST) is a shack-dwellers' movement in Brazil. It originated from the Movimento dos Trabalhadores Rurais Sem Terra () in 1997. It is the biggest organisation of its kind in the country.\n\nThrough a combination of direct confrontation and negotiation with the government, it struggles to reduce Brazil's deficit of roughly 8,000,000 housing units by staging squatters' occupations in the abandoned government buildings that litter Brazilian cities, resisting the often violent attempts by local governments to evict them and negotiating for their conversion into low-income housing. According to the MTST, there are over 5,000,000 housing units available in abandoned buildings in Brazil. The MTST originally emerged as a faction within the MST. MTST, however, focuses on urban instead of rural reform. Although fully autonomous, the organisation has a strategic alliance with the MST and also works closely with other Brazilian urban social movements such as the União Nacional de Moradia Popular () and the Centro dos Movimentos Populares ().\n\nThe movement is politically heterogeneous. On one side, there are branches which resemble a Leninist political party in terms of structure and hierarchy, and on the other side, branches which are clearly committed to goals such as self-management. There is even a branch (in the state of São Paulo) which works almost as a faction of a political party.\n\nThe homeless movement is the most important social movement in Brazilian cities, since the favela movement became weaker and weaker since the 1980s (its role was decisive in the 1960s and 1970s resistance against evictions), due to factors such as political clientelism, and the influence of drug traffickers. The homeless also try to co-operate with other emerging social movements, such as \"insurgent\" hip-hop groups and, in the case of MTST, with the MST, one of the most important landless organisations.\n\nThe best known land occupations conducted by the MTST are:\n\n\nMTST was created by the MST in order to ensure representation of land reform advocacy in the urban sphere. According to the João Pinto foundation and with the Ministry of Cities, there are six million Brazilian families that are living in undignified conditions which is a constitutional breach since the constitution of 1988 states that dignified social living conditions are a right. The MTST justifies its activities because of the 1988 constitution where property is defined as a social right. Brazilian cities are often segregated geographically between the wealthy area and the \"periferia\"which translates to periphery. For a long time segregated social classes in the and rising rent is forcing people who were in difficult economic circumstances to move to the outskirts of the town.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "46496262", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=46496262", "title": "Human rights in the Isle of Man", "text": "Human rights in the Isle of Man\n\nThe Isle of Man is a Crown Dependency located in the Irish Sea between the islands of Great Britain and Ireland with a population in 2015 estimated to be approximately 88,000. It enjoys a high degree of domestic, legislative and political autonomy through its ancient Parliament Tynwald. By convention, the United Kingdom Government is responsible for the conduct of the international relations and defence of the island. The Isle of Man does not have a written constitution, or a Bill of Rights which sets out its Human Rights. These rights are addressed in the \"Human Rights Act 2001\". The island has also ratified a number of international treaties.\n\nThe Isle of Man has ratified six of the nine core human rights treaties. Namely the:\nAs a Crown Dependency, The United Kingdom (UK) is responsible for the international relations for the Isle of Man. The Isle of Man is not subject to the Universal Periodic Review (UPR) process as it is not a member state of the United Nations. However, in its reports on the UK, the UPR often gives recommendations to the UK to urge its overseas territories to implement its recommendations. The Isle of Man has agreed to some UPR recommendations such as ratifying the Optional Protocol on the Convention against Torture in 2014.\n\nThe European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR) was ratified by the UK in 1951 and in 1953; the UK extended the Convention to the Isle of Man. The ECHR was used in the Isle of Man to protect its citizen’s human rights and fundamental freedoms. The ECHR established the European Court of Human Rights, where any individual who feels his or her rights have been violated under the Convention can take their case to the Court. The judgements of the Court are binding on the States concerned. \nThe Convention extends fundamental human rights to individuals such as the right to life, the right to a fair trial and freedom of expression.\n\nThe \"Human Rights Act\" was passed by Tynwald in 2001 and came fully into force on 1 November 2006. This Act is similar in many respects to the UK Human Rights Act. The Act incorporates the fundamental rights and freedoms set out in the ECHR into its domestic law. \nPreviously, an Isle of Man resident who believed that their rights had been violated had to go to the Court of Human Rights in Strasbourg, France to have their case heard. This process could be long and expensive and so the Government decided that the public should be able to guarantee their rights on the Isle of Man.\n\nThe \"Human Rights Act\" ensures that all public authorities act in a way which is compliant with the main articles of the ECHR. The rights enshrined within the Act are designed to protect the individual against any abuses by the State. They are not designed to settle disputes between individuals. If the Act cannot be interpreted in a way which complies with the Convention, a declaration of incompatibility can be made. This is a sign to Tynwald that the law should be changed, but there is no obligation for Tynwald to do so. If Tynwald do not amend the law, then the applicant can take their case to the ECHR.\n\nUnder pressure from the UK government, and to meet ECHR requirements, the death penalty was abolished in 1993 on the Isle of Man; however the last execution had not taken place since 1872. The Isle of Man was the last place in the British Isles to formally abolish the death penalty.\n\nThe House of Keys has 24 members, elected for a five-year term. The Isle of Man lowered its voting age from 18 to 16 in 2006. \nThe Isle of Man became the first action for women’s suffrage by granting women who owned property the right to vote in 1881.\n\nThe \"Employment Act 2006\" sets out a number of employee and employer rights on the Isle of Man such as the right to a minimum wage, the right to a minimum period of notice and unfair dismissals. Pursuant to the \"Miniumum Wage Act 2001\", the Isle of Man has a minimum wage committee who determine different minimum wage amounts depending on the age of the employee.\n\nArticle 6 of the Human Rights Act states that everyone is entitled to the right to a fair trial. There has been concern that the current human rights structures on the Isle of Man do not sufficiently represent the deaf population as the island does not have appropriately qualified persons to assist deaf individuals in arrests and trials which has resulted in questions about the legitimacy of legal outcomes. In 2014, the Legal Aid Committee implemented a fundamental review of the island’s legal aid system to determine the future shape of access to justice for those who do not have the means to pay for it. Committee chairman Andrew Swithinbank stated: \"The focus of the committee is to promote access to justice in a manner which is fair, equitable, transparent and professional and which uses public resources carefully and effectively.\"\n\nThe \"Disability Discrimination Act 2006\" was given royal assent in October 2006 after it was approved by the branches of Tynwald. This Act was designed to demand minimum levels of accessibility for disabled people to buildings and prevent discrimination against disabled people in the supply of goods and services. The Act however, still remains to be implemented. In May 2011, the then chief minister Tony Brown stated “the \"Disability Discrimination Act\" is recognised as an important piece of legislation, however before the act is brought into effect a programme of assessment, education and improvements must take place.” The House of Keys has repeatedly failed to give a deadline for when the Act will be implemented.\n\nIn April 2016 the Isle of Man approved The Marriage and Civil Partnership (Amendment) Bill legalizing same-sex marriage. Same-sex couples have been allowed to enter civil partnerships, but not marriage, since April 2011.\n\nSince the early 1990s, the Isle of Man has relaxed its position with regards to lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender (LGBT) rights. Prior to 1992, same-sex sexual activity was a criminal offence. Post de-criminalisation, the age of consent was set at 21 and then reduced to 18 by the \"Criminal Justice Act 2001\". In 2006 s4(a) of the \"Sexual Offences (Amendment) Act 2006\" further lowered the minimum age for homosexual acts to 16, thus aligning it with the same age of consent for heterosexual acts. They have also been given more rights with regard to employment protection from discrimination (2006), gender recognition (2009), the right to enter into civil partnerships and the right to adopt children (2011). However, it continues to apply special legal regulation to adult male homosexual sex.\nSection 9 of the \"Sexual Offences Act 1992\" contains a number of provisions which criminalise certain “unnatural offences” between men. Sections 9(1) and 9(4) respectively criminalise ‘buggery’ and ‘gross indecency’ between men if one party is under the age of sixteen or if the acts are committed “elsewhere than in private.” Section 10(1) provides buggery and gross indecency will not be considered to be in private if “more than two persons are present” or if the act is done in “any place to which the public have or are permitted to have access to, whether on payment or otherwise.”\n\nSame-sex marriages are illegal in the Isle of Man pursuant to the \"Marriage and Civil Registration (Amendment) Act 2011\" (c. 3). In 2014, Policy and Reform Minister Chris Robertshaw confirmed that same-sex marriages recorded in England and Wales as well as 50 other countries will be treated as civil partnerships in the island.\n\nIn 2013 a local Independent Methodist minister refused to rent a house to two women because they were in a same sex relationship, causing international outrage. However, due to the Isle of Man’s failure to bring in an Equality Act, the discrimination was legal. An Equality Bill, based upon the UK Equality Act 2010 to update the island’s discrimination laws was swiftly put into drafting process. In early 2017 both houses of Tynwald passed the equality bill with many amendments. In July, 2017 the Equality Bill became the Equality Act after royal assent and will go into effect from July 2019.\n\nBirching was a form of corporal punishment used on the Isle of Man during the 1960s and 1970s. It was principally the form of punishment for boys under 15 convicted of stealing, however was altered in 1960 so that birching could be used on males up to 21 years of age. In 1972 the case of \"Tyrer v The United Kingdom\" went to Human Rights Court. By a majority of six votes to one, the Court held Tyrer's birching to constitute degrading treatment contrary to the Article 3 of the ECHR. This was labelled a landmark decision by Manfred Nowak, UN Special Rapporteur on torture and other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment. It wasn’t until 1993 that birching was formally repealed in the Isle of Man.\n\nUnder Article 1 of the \"Children and Young Persons Act 1966\", parents have the right to administer “reasonable chastisement” to children. The Global Initiative to end all corporal punishment of children prepared a report in 2013 suggesting the Isle of Man repeal a number of statutes relating to corporal punishment of children by all persons with authority over children. This included persons in day care centres, schools and penal institutions. However, the Isle of Man has been reluctant to do so, declining to implement UPR recommendations to the UK in both 2008 and 2013 for it to ban corporal punishment on children in its overseas territories. The Isle of Man stated that it does not see the need for reform as it believes the current law is working well and that parents should be allowed to discipline children.\n\n"}

It is an advocacy group promoting the interests of lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender and intersex persons, at the European level. Its membership comprises more than 500 organisations from throughout Europe and Central Asia. The Association enjoys consultative status at Economic and Social Council of the United Nations (ECOSOC) and participatory status at the Council of Europe.\n\nILGA-Europe was founded in 1996, when its parent organisation, the International Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Trans and Intersex Association, established separate regions. It took over responsibility for supporting the development of the LGBT movement in Europe including Transgender Europe, Inter-LGBT, and for relationships with the European Union, Council of Europe and the Organisation for Security and Co-operation in Europe.\n\nInitially ILGA-Europe worked entirely on the basis of volunteer resources. However, in 2001, its potential contribution to the European Union's anti-discrimination policies (established under Article 13 of the Treaty of Amsterdam) was recognised through the provision of core funding, currently through the PROGRESS Programme. This enabled ILGA-Europe to set up an office in Brussels, to recruit permanent staff, and to conduct an extensive programme of work in relation to sexual orientation discrimination within the EU Member States and the accession countries. Financial support from the Sigrid Rausing Trust, the Open Society Institute, Freedom House, the US State Department and the Ministry of Education, Culture and Science of the Netherlands allows ILGA-Europe to extend its work in areas not covered by EU funding, including Eastern Europe and Central Asia, and on transgender issues.\n\nILGA-Europe has hosted its annual conference at the end of October, since 2000, where member organisations elect the Executive Board and decide on the next year's working priorities.\n\n\nILGA-Europe works to promote equality and non-discrimination for LGBTI people in asylum, education, employment, family law, freedom of assembly, hate crime, hate speech and health; and works worldwide to protect human rights defenders, trans people and intersex people. The Association provides funding and training for its 500 member organisations, \"to maximise efficiency and the use of resources by LGBTI organisations in working towards achievement of their goals; to maximise the impact of advocacy work at the European level; to ensure sustainability of the LGBTI movement in Europe.\"\n\nILGA-Europe works with EU Institutions, the Council of Europe and the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe to promote equality by lobbying and advocacy, including supporting the adoption of the proposed EU Anti-Discrimination Directive, that would ban discrimination on the grounds of age, disability, religion or belief and sexual orientation in all areas of EU competence. It also uses strategic litigation at the European Court of Human Rights and the European Court of Justice to end discrimination, by identifying gaps in protections, encouraging organisations and individuals to develop court cases, and support such cases with legal resources and amicus curiae briefs.\n\nFor the 2014 European Parliament election, ILGA-Europe promoted its \"Come Out 2014 European Election Pledge\" to candidate MEPs, which focused on priority LGBTI issues for the 2014–2019 Parliament: an EU roadmap on LGBTI equality; EU human rights enforcement; completing the EU Anti-Discrimination directive; combating homophobic and transphobic violence; an inclusive definition of 'family'; trans rights and depatholigisation; action against school bullying; health discrimination and inequalities; LGBTI asylum seekers; and making the EU champion LGBTI rights worldwide. 187 elected MEPs (25 percent) signed the pledge, including 83 members of the PES, 14 ALDE members and 14 from the EPP.\n\nToday ILGA-Europe has more than 20 staff who work in four areas: Advocacy, Communications, Finance and Administration, and Programmes. All are based at the organisation's office in the European Quarter in Brussels.\n\nEach May, ILGA-Europe releases its \"Rainbow Europe\" review, to mark the International Day Against Homophobia and Transphobia. It reviews the human rights situation and assesses what life is like for LGBTI people in every European country, covering discrimination, family recognition, hate speech/crimes, gender recognition, freedom of assembly, association and express, and asylum laws. In 2016, Malta came top of the rankings; it was rated to have 88% progress toward respect of human rights and full equality, just ahead of Belgium and the United Kingdom. Azerbaijan was ranked as the worst for LGBTI equality, scoring just 5%, closely followed by Russia, Armenia and Turkey. The biggest increase since the 2015 review, was that of Greece by 19 points (picking 58%). The 2016 \"Rainbow Europe\" reviews are given in the table below.\nTo include intersex people in its remit, ILGA-Europe and ILGA have jointly sponsored the only international gathering of intersex activists and organisations. The International Intersex Forum has taken place in Europe annually since 2011.\n\nThe third forum was held in Malta in 2013 with 34 people representing 30 organisations from all continents. The closing statement affirmed the existence of intersex people, reaffirmed \"the principles of the First and Second International Intersex Fora and extend the demands aiming to end discrimination against intersex people and to ensure the right of bodily integrity, physical autonomy and self-determination\". For the first time, participants made a statement on birth registrations, in addition to other human rights issues.\n\n"}

During summer, when water is scarce, the Ice Stupa melts to increase water supply for crops. Ice Stupa was invented by Sonam Wangchuk in Ladakh (India) and the project is undertaken by the NGO Students' Educational and Cultural Movement of Ladakh. Launched in October 2013, the test project started in January 2014 under the project name \"The Ice Stupa project\". On 15 November 2016, Sonam Wangchuk was awarded the Rolex Awards for Enterprise for his work on Ice Stupa.\n\nLadakh is a cold desert and during winter agriculture is not practiced due to frozen soil and low air temperatures. During spring season, water requirement for sowing increases whereas streams dry up. With annual rainfall of less than , agriculture in Ladakh is solely dependent on snow and glacier meltwater. Due to climate change, the region experiences hotter summers with increase in melts along with shift in the timing and precipitation of the melts. Subsequently, during the spring season water is more scarce which in turn impacts agriculture and food supplies.\n\nIn the month of May, Sonam Wangchuk noticed the ice under a bridge. Despite summer and lowest elevation in Ladakh, the ice had not melted since it was not under direct sunlight. Wangchuk realized ice could last longer in Ladakh if it could be shaded from the sun. Since providing shade to larger water bodies was not possible, Wangchuk thought of freezing and storing water in the shape of a cone that offers minimum surface area to the sun whilst holding high volume of water.\n\nIn October 2013, Sonam Wangchuk created the first prototype of Ice Stupa by freezing in Leh without any shade from the sun. Water was piped from upstream using gravity. Electricity or machinery was not used for pumping water. The Ice Stupa did not melt fully till 18 May 2014, even when the temperature was above .\n\n\n"}

The Revenue Commissioners, Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources and Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport also have intelligence roles, but are not full members of the NSC.\n\nThe NSC meets on a regular scheduled basis and convenes additionally when required. The Taoiseach's office is responsible for calling meetings of the NSC. It was established in 1974 tasked with advising the Taoiseach and cabinet on high-level security issues. The committee receives threat assessments from the Garda Commissioner and the Chief of Staff, and reviews the overall security situation in the domestic and international environment. The Minister for Defence receives monthly intelligence, state security and defence briefings from the Director of Military Intelligence.\n\nThe constituents of the National Security Committee deliberate on the Republic of Ireland's \"International Terror Threat Level\". Five levels are used to grade the international threat of a terrorist attack to Ireland; low, moderate, substantial, severe and critical. The gradings are based on a series of factors, including information supplied by international authorities. The threat level is administered by the Garda Síochána.\n\nInternational Terror Threat Level:\n\n\nThe International Terror Threat Level was raised from low to moderate following the January 2015 Île-de-France attacks.\n\nThe National Civil Aviation Security Committee (NCASC) is a standing committee established in 1974.

The National Civil Aviation Security Committee meets at a minimum biannually. The NCASC comprises senior representatives of government departments, Irish airports, Irish airlines, the Garda Síochána, the Defence Forces, An Post, Customs & Excise (Revenue), the Irish Aviation Authority (IAA), and the Irish Airline Pilots Association (IALPA). The committee was established under the National Civil Aviation Security Programme (NCASP) which is classified on security grounds, and therefore the deliberations of the committee are confidential.\n\nThe National Security Committee is the conduit for officials to communicate with the Taoiseach and/or cabinet members if their minister – the normal channel – became unavailable (or was killed). In preparation for such extreme events drafts of emergency powers legislation have been drawn up in secret by officials from the Department of Justice, including legislation to deal with circumstances such as an attack on cabinet involving numerous deaths.\n\nIn July 2017, a new Government Security Committee designated Cabinet Committee F (named after the room in which it held its first meeting) was established. Chaired by Taoiseach Leo Varadkar, the new committee is modelled on the British government COBRA crisis management committee with the aim of bringing together more senior cabinet-level ministers on matters of state security. Its inaugural meeting was attended by the Tánaiste; Minister of State at the Department of Defence; Ministers and senior officials from the Departments of Justice & Equality; Defence; Enterprise & Innovation; Finance and Public Expenditure & Reform; Foreign Affairs & Trade; Health; Housing, Planning & Local Government; Communications, Climate Action & Environment; and Transport, Tourism & Sport, where senior Defence Forces and Garda officers briefed them on the international terrorism threat.\n\n"}

In 1873, as the start of the 'to the people' movement, when idealistic students travelled to the countryside hoping to radicalise the peasants, he and two other students from Kharkov, Constantin Dobrogeanu-Gherea and S.N.Kulasko set up a blacksmith shop in Gherea's home village, Slavyanka. They had to abandon the project to avoid arrest. He returned to Kharkov to complete his studies. In 1874, a few months after qualifying as a surgeon, he again 'went to the people' in the Volga region, and was one of the organisers of Land and Liberty (\"Земля и Воля\" - Zemlya i Volya).\n\nWhen Zemlya i Volya split in August 1879, with one faction - impatient with the failure to politicise the peasantry - breaking off the form the People's Will and plan the assassination of the Tsar, Aptekman joined the future founder of Russian Marxism, Georgi Plekhanov and in organising Black Partition (\"Черный Передел\" -Cherny Peredel) grouping which insisted that the continued use of propaganda was the best means of achieving social change.

Such structures are of interest to various fields, including sociology, government, economics, and business. A power structure may be formal and intentionally constructed to maximize values like fairness or efficiency, as in a hierarchical organization wherein every entity, except one, is subordinate to a single other entity. Conversely, a power structure may be an informal set of roles, such as those found in a dominance hierarchy in which members of a social group interact, often aggressively, to create a ranking system. A culture that is organised in a dominance hierarchy is a dominator culture, the opposite of an egalitarian culture of partnership. A visible, dominant group or elite that holds power or authority within a power structure is often referred to as being the Establishment.

After Caria's sudden death, Bustianu Cumpostu was elected new leader by defeating Gavino Sale, who would lead the party's left-wing faction for five years, before leaving in 2001.\n\nIn the 1996 general election SN won 4.3% in single-seat constituencies (11.6% in Tortolì and 9.6% in Iglesias), despite being present only in ten constituencies out of fourteen, and 2.3% for proportional representation, due to competition from the Sardinian Action Party (PSd'Az), which gained 3.8%.\n\nIn the 1999 Sardinian regional election SN had its best result ever, as Cumpostu received 5.8% of the vote for president, while the PSd'Az gained 8.3% with Franco Meloni.

{"id": "42842497", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=42842497", "title": "Staircase model", "text": "Staircase model\n\nThe staircase model is a psychological explanation as to why out of large numbers of disgruntled people in society, only a very small minority end up committing acts of terrorism. It was proposed in 2005 by Fathali M. Moghaddam in his paper \"The Staircase to Terrorism\". The model involves a metaphorical staircase, where each step is influenced by a specific psychological process. It is proposed that the higher an individual moves up the staircase, the fewer alternatives to violence they will see, ultimately resulting in the destruction of themselves, others, or both.\n\nMoghaddam observed that societal-level variables, such as lack of democratic processes, social inequality, availability of weapons and rapid demographic changes, do not explain why only a small percentage of people living under the same adverse conditions end up committing acts of violence against innocent targets. He proposed the staircase model to explain this phenomenon, describing the pathway to terrorism as a narrowing staircase, that very few people reach the top of.\n\nThe model involves six floors.\nThe ground floor is inhabited by all members of society. All members of society evaluate their living conditions in terms of fairness. People will remain on the ground floor as long as they consider their living conditions to be fair. Those who perceive injustice move onto the first floor.\n\nOn the first floor, people consider their options for improving their situation. People who find options to improve their individual situation and influence decision-makers leave the staircase at this floor in order to pursue non-violent paths. People who are unsatisfied with their available options move onto the second floor.\n\nIt is here that feelings of both anger and frustration over not being able to improve the situation instigate a search for a target to blame. This target can either be a direct opponent, such as a government, or a third party to whom aggression is displaced, such as an ethnic or religious group. People who are persuaded that they have an enemy toward whom they can direct their aggression, will proceed to the third floor.\n\nPeople who arrive here have already developed a readiness towards violence. These feelings can be capitalised on by a violent organisation that is offering a sense of 'moral engagement' to potential recruits. Within these organisations violent actions against a perceived enemy are regarded as acceptable or even as one's duty. Potential recruits are offered a new social identity as members of a selective ingroup who aim to bring justice to the world. People who find this offer appealing will move on to the fourth floor.\n\nIt is here that thinking such as 'us' versus 'them' is promoted. Recruits are isolated from friends and family, strict secrecy is imposed and the legitimacy of the organisation is emphasised. People who reach this floor will rarely withdraw and exit the staircase alive. They will move onto the fifth floor if an opportunity to do so presents.\n\nIt is here that the violent act is carried out. In order to be as effective as possible, any inhibition about killing innocent people must be overcome. This is done via two means. Categorisation stresses the differentiation between ingroup and out group, and distancing exaggerates the differences between the ingroup and the perceived enemy.\n\nMoghaddam states the model is not a formal one, but rather a metaphor for the purpose of providing general framework in order to organise current psychological knowledge regarding terrorism. Nevertheless, the model is cited as useful for conceptualising the process that results in only a small number of individuals from a large group of disgruntled people will commit acts of violence against the innocent. Moghaddam states that it is not enough to simply try and identify and stop potential terrorists, as this will only make room for new people to step forward, and instead proposes that the only way to end terrorism is by reforming the condition on the ground floor so that it is no longer perceived as unjust and hopeless by a large portion of society.\n\nThe empirical basis of the model has been evaluated by an article in the Scandinavian Journal of Psychology. The findings state that whilst most of the processes in the model are supported by empirical evidence, the quantity and quality of said evidence varies. Whilst praising Moghaddam's model for emphasising potential mechanisms for future study, the review concludes that the staircase model may not be the right metaphor for summarising the phenomena of terrorism, citing a lack of evidence for transition between the floors, and the possibility that some floors and corresponding processes from the model could be removed entirely due to a lack of empirical evidence.\n"}

The office was responsible for the relationship of the government toward churches and religious groups. Policy was set by the ruling Socialist Unity Party (SED), but direct contact with the churches and religious groups was essentially restricted to the Secretariat in order to preserve the SED's stance as atheist and anti-religion.\n\nThe office was established in 1957 following the example of the Soviet Union and other communist countries. The SED's goal was to prevent religious involvement in state affairs, particularly with regard to education and training of children and young people. The Secretary was responsible for maintaining the relationship between government and the churches and religious groups, but was kept weak with no power to set policy. Policy towards religion was set by the SED, whose leaders rarely met with religious leaders. This arrangement allowed the SED to maintain its appearance as an \"atheistic party against the Church\". However, it also created a situation where, not having direct contact with the churches, the party was forced to rely on other's reports for what was actually going on with the churches, reports that often minimized or omitted serious criticism of the communist government \"in order to avoid excited or angry decisions, or to confirm the predominant picture among the recipients of the report of harmonious societal development.\"\n\nIn addition to maintaining relationships with the churches, the Secretary was to ensure that the laws and ordinances kept pace with the development of the socialist state. The SED expected religion to die out over time and sought to restrict the churches to conducting rites and services. Church representatives viewed the office as the \"State Secretariat Against Church Affairs\".\n\nA list, based on religions recognized by the post-war Soviet Military Administration was drawn up by the Ministry of the Interior. Those that were on the list were allowed to hold church services, though there were waves of persecution in 1953 and 1958, including arrests of ministers and others, and show trials.\n\nTwo religions were kept off the list, Jehovah's Witnesses and Christian Science. Jehovah's Witnesses were denied approval based on their \"rejection of secular authority\". Christian Science was denied because of the religion's affiliation with the United States and a Nazi-era law related to medical practice. Christian Science was later granted official recognition in November 1989, just prior to the fall of the Berlin Wall.\n\n\n"}

Baker and Bohdan Siryk and published by Western Psychological Services in 1987 (manual published 1989). The questionnaire is proprietary and copies of the questionnaire as well as the manual can be purchased from the WPS website.\n\nIn a 1984 paper, Baker and Siryk described the results of a 52-item self-report inventory that used a Likert scale. They had administered this inventory to 734 students, and their paper discussed the reliability and validity of the data thus obtained. This would later grow into the Student Adaptation to Colleges Questionnaire.\n\nThe questionnaire is a 67-item self-report inventory that assesses overall adjustment to college, as well as adjustment in four specific areas:\n\n\nThe authors claim that if the questionnaire is used at the time people enter college, it can be used for the early detection of potential adjustment problems and can increase the retention of students who might otherwise drop out.\n\nThere is some academic research that relies on the SACQ and judges its usefulness. A 1992 paper by Krotseng used discriminant analysis to determine \"(1) the extent to which the SACQ accurately predicts student departure for a private, comprehensive university; (2) SACQ items distinguishing nonpersisters; (3) use with an incoming class; and (4) evidence linking the SACQ with intervention strategies.\" Another 1992 paper by Dahmus, Bernardin, and Bernardin discussed the SACQ's potential.\n\nA 1994 study by Gerdes and Mallinckrodt used SACQ data to measure the emotional, social, and academic adjustment of college students.\n\nA 2002 paper by Beyers and Goossens from the Catholic University of Leuven considered the applicability of the SACQ to Europe and concluded: \"With some reservations regarding the Academic Adjustment subscale, then, the SACQ seems to be a useful tool for research on university life among college students in Europe.\"\n\nThe abstract of a 2012 meta-analysis by Credé and Niehorster (k = 237, N = 44,668) reads: \"The review, based on studies using the Student Adaptation to College Questionnaire, is organized around three primary themes: (1) the structure of students’ adjustment to college, (2) the relationship of adjustment to college constructs with possible antecedents and correlates, and (3) the relationship of adjustment to college constructs with college grades and college retention. Meta-analytic results indicate that adjustment to college is multidimensional, predictive of college grades, and an unusually good predictor of college retention. Adjustment to college is also shown to be moderately related to individual traits, social support, and students’ relationships with their parents. Weaker relationships are evident with demographic variables, prior achievement, coping approaches, and variables that reflect students’ psychological independence from their parents. Theoretical and practical implications for the study of students’ adjustment to college, academic performance, and retention are discussed.\"\n"}

Each ToolBank increases the impact of its local charitable sector by lending tools to organizations for use in the fulfillment of their missions. The available inventory of a typical ToolBank includes tools for landscaping, carpentry, plumbing, masonry as well as power tools, ladders, wheelbarrows, and others. The Atlanta Community ToolBank is currently the largest ToolBank in existence, with over 200 tool types in its lending inventory. The available inventory of the Atlanta Community ToolBank can be found here. Nine ToolBanks are currently lending tools in Atlanta GA, Baltimore MD, Charlotte NC, Cincinnati OH, Houston TX, Phoenix AZ, Portland OR, Richmond VA, and Chicago, IL. The national network of ToolBanks is administered by the parent organization ToolBank USA, which was founded in 2008 to replicate the impact of the Atlanta ToolBank in cities beyond Atlanta. In 2014, ToolBank USA launched ToolBank Disaster Services, a program to deliver tools to communities affected by disaster. ToolBanks loaned $5.8M worth of tools and equipment to charitable organizations in 2015. \n\nThe ToolBank program model differs from the more common tool library model in that ToolBanks loan tools exclusively to other charitable organizations; ToolBank tools are not available to individuals. The ToolBank inventory is designated for the purpose of increasing the impact of the nonprofit sector and less formalized grassroots organizations. Typical borrowers of ToolBank tools include faith-based organizations, public schools, neighborhood organizations, public/private partnerships with community-oriented missions, social clubs with a service mission, gardening clubs, and others. Proof of charitable intent is verified prior to accessing ToolBank tools.\n\nThe ToolBank performs three primary functions:\n\n1. Tool Lending: The ToolBank lends tools of all kinds for use in volunteer projects, facility maintenance and improvement projects, community improvement events, and special events.\n\n2. Tool Advocacy: ToolBank staff advocates for the complete and timely return of all borrowed tools, to guarantee the long-term sustainability of available inventory. Staff also seeks compensation for lost tools and tools returned late.\n\n3. Tool Maintenance: The ToolBank performs routine maintenance and repairs on all equipment to ensure good condition and to extend the lifespan of the inventory. This function is typically performed by volunteers and community service workers.\n\nThrough these three functions, local community organizations may benefit by:\nensuring that all participating volunteers are properly equipped;\nengaging larger volunteer groups;\nperforming a broader scope of service projects;\nengaging more highly skilled volunteers; and\neliminating tool purchase, repair, and storage costs. \n\nToolBank is a registered mark of the Atlanta Community ToolBank. The Atlanta Community ToolBank granted a Right to License to ToolBank USA in 2008. ToolBank USA is a nonprofit organization created in February 2008, charged with the successful nationwide replication of the ToolBank program model. ToolBank USA was launched by a founding grant from The Home Depot Foundation.\n\nThe Atlanta Community ToolBank originated in Atlanta GA as an offshoot of a charitable no-cost home repair program known as Community Reinvestment Inc (CRI), founded in 1990. CRI's tool inventory grew organically as a result of volunteers donating equipment in support of the program. Local neighborhood associations and churches periodically borrowed CRI's tools for their own cleanup days and volunteer events, giving rise to the core concept of the ToolBank. The specific origin of the term ToolBank is unknown; CRI began offering the ToolBank as a formal program in 1992.\n"}

About 90% of Kosovars are ethnic Albanians. \n\nPolls supporting unification of Kosovo with Albania notwithstanding, the goal of Albanian politicians has been entrance into NATO and the EU, rather than national unification. Some Roman Catholic and Orthodox Christian Albanians fear that any possible unification of Balkan areas that bring sizable numbers of Muslims into the new state may lead to an increasing \"Muslimization\" of Albania.\n\nUnification in the eyes of many has already been achieved. Kosovo is predominately Albanian, and with the Republic of Albania shares some common administrative sectors such as education, policing, and foreign policy. Culture, heritage and trade have also been greatly unified between the two which also share an open border.\n\nDuring the 1981 protests in Kosovo Yugoslavia feared a potential unification of Kosovo to Albania.

{"id": "401486", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=401486", "title": "War bond", "text": "War bond\n\nWar bonds are debt securities issued by a government to finance military operations and other expenditure in times of war.\nIn practice, modern governments finance war by putting additional money into circulation, and the function of the bonds is to remove money from circulation and help to control inflation. War bonds are either retail bonds marketed directly to the public or wholesale bonds traded on a stock market. Exhortations to buy war bonds are often accompanied by appeals to patriotism and conscience. Retail war bonds, like other retail bonds, tend to have a yield which is below that offered by the market and are often made available in a wide range of denominations to make them affordable for all citizens.\n\nGovernments throughout history have needed to borrow money to fight wars. Traditionally they dealt with a small group of rich financiers such as Jakob Fugger and Nathan Rothschild, but no particular distinction was made between debt incurred in war or peace. An early use of the term \"war bond\" was for the $ raised by the US Congress in an Act of 14 March 1812, to fund the War of 1812, but this was not aimed at the general public. Until July 2015, perhaps the oldest bonds still outstanding as a result of war were the British Consols, some of which were the result of the refinancing of incurring debts during the Napoleonic Wars, but these were redeemed following the passing of the Finance Act 2015.\n\nThe government of Austria-Hungary knew from the early days of the First World War that it could not count on advances from its principal banking institutions to meet the growing costs of the war. Instead, it implemented a war finance policy modeled upon that of Germany: in November 1914, the first funded loan was issued. As in Germany, the Austro-Hungarian loans followed a prearranged plan and were issued at half yearly intervals every November and May. The first Austrian bonds paid 5% interest and had a five-year term. The smallest bond denomination available was 100 kronen.\n\nHungary issued loans separately from Austria in 1919, after the war and after it had separated from Austria, in the form of stocks that permitted the subscriber to demand repayment after a year's notice. Interest was fixed at 6%, and the smallest denomination was 50 korona. Subscriptions to the first Austrian bond issue amounted to the equivalent of $; those of the first Hungarian issue were equivalent to $.\n\nThe limited financial resources of children were tapped through campaigns in schools. The initial minimum Austrian bond denomination of 100 kronen still exceeded the means of most children, so the third bond issue, in 1915, introduced a scheme whereby children could donate a small amount and take out a bank loan to cover the rest of the 100 kronen. The initiative was immensely successful, eliciting funds and encouraging loyalty to the state and its future among Austro-Hungarian youth. Over kronen was collected in the first three \"child bond\" issues.\n\nCanada's involvement in the First World War began in 1914, with Canadian war bonds called \"Victory Bonds\" after 1917. The first domestic war loan was raised in November 1915, but not until the fourth campaign of November 1917 was the term Victory Loan applied. The First Victory Loan was a 5.5% issue of 5, 10 and 20 year gold bonds in denominations as small as $50. It was quickly oversubscribed, collecting $ or about $50 per capita. The Second and Third Victory Loans were floated in 1918 and 1919, bringing another $. For those who could not afford to buy Victory Bonds, the government also issued War Savings Certificates. The government awarded communities who bought large amounts of bonds Victory Loan Honour Flags.\n\nUnlike France and Britain, at the outbreak of the First World War Germany found itself largely excluded from international financial markets. This became most apparent after an attempt to float a major loan on Wall Street failed in 1914. As such, Germany was largely limited to domestic borrowing, which was induced by a series of war credit bills passing the Reichstag. This took place in many forms; however, the most publicised were the public war bond () drives.\n\nNine bond drives were conducted over the length of the war and, as in Austria-Hungary, the loans were issued at six-month intervals. The drives themselves would often last several weeks, during which there was extensive use of propaganda via all possible media. Most bonds had a rate of return of 5% and were redeemable over a ten-year period, in semi-annual payments. Like war bonds in other countries, the German war bonds drives were designed to be extravagant displays of patriotism and the bonds were sold through banks, post offices and other financial institutions.\n\nAs in other countries, the majority investors were not individuals but institutions and large corporations. Industries, university endowments, local banks and even city governments were the prime investors in the war bonds. In part because of intense public pressure and in part due to patriotic commitment the bond drives proved extremely successful, raising approximately marks in funds. Although extremely successful the war bond drives only covered two-thirds of war-related expenditures. Meanwhile, the interest payable on the bonds represented a growing expense which required further resources to pay it.\n\nIn August 1914 the gold reserves of the Bank of England, and effectively of all banking institutions in Great Britain, amounted to £ (equivalent to £ in 2015). The banks feared the declaration of war would trigger a run on the banks, so the Chancellor David Lloyd George extended the August bank holiday for three days to allow time for the passing of the Currency and Bank Notes Act 1914, by which Britain left the gold standard. Under this Act the Treasury issued £ (equivalent to £ in 2013) of paper banknotes, without the backing of gold, with which the banks could repay their obligations. Leading banker Walter Leaf described these Treasury notes as \"essentially a War Loan free of interest, for an unlimited period, and as such was a highly profitable expedient from the point of view of the Government\".\n\nThe first interest-bearing War Loan was issued in November 1914 at an interest rate of 3.5%, to be redeemed at par in 1925–28. It raised £; £ at face value as it was issued at a 5% discount. It was revealed in 2017 that public subscriptions amounted to £91m, and the balance had been subscribed by the Bank of England, under the names of then governor, John Gordon Nairne, and his deputy Ernest Harvey. It was followed by £ of a second War Loan in June 1915, at 4.5%. £ of this was accounted for by conversion of the 3.5% issue, and a further £ by holders of 2.5% and 2.75% Consols, who were also allowed to transfer to the higher interest rate. The government also pledged that if they issued War Loans at even higher interest, holders of the 4.5% bonds might also convert to the new rate. In his memoirs Lloyd George stated his regret that his successor Reginald McKenna increased the interest rate at a time when investors had few alternatives. Not only did it directly increase the nation's annual interest payments by £ but it meant interest rates were higher throughout the economy during the post-war depression.\n\nCompared to France, the British government relied more on short-term financing in the form of treasury bills and exchequer bonds during World War I. Treasury bills provided the bulk of British government funds in 1916, and were available for terms of 3, 6, 9 and 12 months at an interest rate of 5%. Although these were not formally designated as war bonds, advertising was explicit about their purpose. This April 1916 advertisement for 5% Exchequer bonds was typical of the time: \"LEND YOUR MONEY TO YOUR COUNTRY. The soldier does not grudge offering his life to his country. He offers it freely, for his life may be the price of Victory. But Victory cannot be won without money as well as men, and your money is needed. Unlike the soldier, the investor runs no risk. If you invest in Exchequer Bonds your money, capital and interest alike, is secured on the Consolidated Fund of the United Kingdom, the premier security of the world.\"\n\nPolicy changed when Asquith's government fell in December 1916 and Bonar Law became Chancellor in the new coalition government. The third War Loan was launched in January 1917 at a 5% discount to face value and paying 5% interest (or 4% tax-free for 25 years), a rate Lloyd George described as \"penal\". Holders of existing War Loans, Treasury Bills and War Expenditure Certificates could convert to the 5% issue. Of the £ raised by the 5% War Loan, only £ was new money; the rest was conversions of £ of 4.5% Loan, £ of Exchequer Bonds and £ of Treasury Bills. Labour politician Tom Johnston would later write of the 1917 War Loan \"No foreign conqueror could have devised a more complete robbery and enslavement of the British Nation\".\n\nOn 30 June 1932 Neville Chamberlain announced that the Government would exercise its right to call in the 5% War Loan, offering a choice of taking cash or continuing the loan at 3.5%. Although they were obliged to give 90 days' notice of such a change, a 1% tax-free cash bonus was offered to holders who acted by 31 July. This conversion saved the government about £ net per year. On 3 December 2014 the UK Government announced it would redeem the outstanding war loans on 9 March 2015.\n\nIn 1917 and 1918, the United States government issued Liberty Bonds to raise money for its involvement in World War I. An aggressive campaign was created by Secretary of the Treasury William Gibbs McAdoo to popularize the bonds, grounded largely as patriotic appeals. The Treasury Department worked closely with the Committee on Public Information in developing Liberty Bond campaigns. The resulting propaganda messages often borrowed heavily from military colloquial speech.\n\nThe government used famous artists to make posters, and used movie stars to host bond rallies. Al Jolson, Elsie Janis, Mary Pickford, Douglas Fairbanks and Charlie Chaplin were among the celebrities who made public appearances promoting the patriotic element of purchasing Liberty Bonds. Chaplin also made a short film, \"The Bond\", at his own expense for the drive. Even the Boy Scouts and Girl Scouts sold bonds under the slogan \"Every Scout to Save a Soldier\". The campaign spurred community efforts across the country to sell the bonds and was a great success resulting in over-subscriptions to the second, third and fourth bond issues. According to the Massachusetts Historical Society, \"Because the first World War cost the federal government more than $ (by way of comparison, total federal expenditures in 1913 were only $), these programs became vital as a way to raise funds.\"\n\nThrough the selling of Liberty Bonds, the government raised $ for the war effort. The majority of sales were not to individuals but to banks and financial groups that ignored the patriotic appeal and bought the bonds principally as an investment opportunity. The bond campaigns themselves proved relatively ineffective at gaining widespread public support. The majority of Americans were simply uncomfortable converting a significant portion of their savings into what was, for them, a new and uncertain form of investment. The forceful sales atmosphere associated with the Liberty Bond campaigns ultimately produced disappointing sales figures. As such, the bond campaigns are remembered more for their associated level of coercion and bullying than its patriotic and voluntary nature. Secretary of the Treasury Henry Morgenthau, Jr. would face a balancing act between coercion and volunteerism in his bond campaigns during World War II.\n\nCanada's involvement in the Second World War began when Canada declared war on Nazi Germany on September 10, 1939, one week after the United Kingdom. Approximately half of the Canadian war cost was covered by War Savings Certificates and war bonds known as \"Victory Bonds\" as in World War I. War Savings Certificates began selling in May 1940 and were sold door-to-door by volunteers as well as at banks, post offices, trust companies and other authorised dealers. They matured after seven years and paid $5 for every $4 invested but individuals could not own more than $600 each in certificates. Although the effort raised $ in funds and was successful in financially involving millions of Canadians in the war effort, it only provided the Government of Canada with a fraction of what was needed.\n\nThe sale of Victory Bonds proved far more successful financially. There were ten wartime and one postwar Victory Bond drives. Unlike the War Savings Certificates, there was no purchase limit to Victory Bonds. The bonds were issued with maturities of between six and fourteen years with interest rates ranging from 1.5% for short-term bonds and 3% for long-term bonds and were issued in denominations of between $50 and $100,000. Canadians bought $ worth of Victory Bonds or some $550 per capita with businesses accounting for half of all Victory Bond sales. The first Victory Bond issue in February 1940 met its goal of $ in less than 48 hours, the second issue in September 1940 reaching its goal of $ almost as quickly.\n\nWhen it became apparent that the war would last a number of years the war bond and certificate programs were organised more formally under the National War Finance Committee in December 1941, directed initially by the president of the Bank of Montreal and subsequently by the Governor of the Bank of Canada. Under the more honed direction the committee developed strategies, propaganda and the wide recruitment of volunteers for bonds drives. Bond drives took place every six months during which no other organization was permitted to solicit the public for money. The government spent over $ on marketing which employed posters, direct mailing, movie trailers, radio commercials and full page advertisement in most major daily newspaper and weekly magazine. Realistic staged military invasion, such as the If Day scenario in Winnipeg, Manitoba, were even employed to raise awareness and shock citizens into purchasing bonds.\n\nThe Nazi regime never attempted to convince the general populace to buy long-term war bonds as had been done during the First World War. The Reich government did not want to present any perceived form of public referendum on the war, which would be the indirect result if a bond drive did poorly. Rather, the regime financed its war efforts by borrowing directly from financial institutions, using short-term war bonds as collateral. German bankers, with no demonstration of resistance, agreed to taking state bonds into their portfolios. Financial institutions transferred their money to the Finance Department in exchange for promissory notes. Through this strategy, 40 million bank and investment accounts were quietly converted into war bonds, providing the Reich government with a continuous supply of money. Likewise, German bank commissioners compelled occupied Czechoslovakia to buy up German war bonds. By the end of the war, German war bonds accounted for 70% of investments held by Czechoslovakian banks.\n\nIn the United Kingdom, the National Savings Movement was instrumental in raising funds for the war effort during both world wars. During World War II a \"War Savings Campaign\" was set up by the War Office to support the war effort. \"Local savings weeks\" were held which were promoted with posters with titles such as \"Lend to Defend the Right to be Free\", \"Save your way to Victory\" and \"War Savings are Warships\".\n\nBy the summer of 1940, the victories of Nazi Germany against Poland, Denmark, Norway, Belgium, the Netherlands and France brought urgency to the government, which was discreetly preparing for possible United States involvement in World War II. Of principal concern were issues surrounding war financing. Many of President Franklin D. Roosevelt's advisers favored a system of tax increases and enforced savings program as advocated by British economist John Maynard Keynes. In theory, this would permit increased spending while decreasing the risk of inflation. Secretary of the Treasury Henry Morgenthau, Jr. however preferred a voluntary loan system and began planning a national defense bond program in the fall of 1940. The intent was to unite the attractiveness of the baby bonds that had been implemented in the interwar period with the patriotic element of the Liberty Bonds from the First World War.\nHans Morgenthau sought the aid of Peter Odegard, a political scientist specialised in propaganda, in drawing up the goals for the bond program. On the advice of Odegard the Treasury began marketing the previously successful baby bonds as \"defense bonds\". Three new series of bond notes, Series E, F and G, would be introduced, of which Series E would be targeted at individuals as \"defense bonds\". Like the baby bonds, they were sold for as little as $18.75 and matured in ten years, at which time the United States government paid the bondholder $25. Large denominations of between $50 and $1000 were also made available, all of which, unlike the Liberty Bonds of the First World War, were non-negotiable bonds. For those that found it difficult to purchase an entire bond at once, 10-cent savings stamps could be purchased and collected in Treasury-approved stamp albums until the recipient had accumulated enough stamps for a bond purchase. The name of the bonds was eventually changed to War Bonds after the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor on 7 December 1941, which resulted in the United States entering the war.\n\nThe War Finance Committee was placed in charge of supervising the sale of all bonds, and the War Advertising Council promoted voluntary compliance with bond buying. Popular contemporary art was used to help promote the bonds such as \"Any Bonds Today?\", a Warner Brothers theatrical cartoon. More than a quarter of a billion dollars' worth of advertising was donated during the first three years of the National Defense Savings Program. The government appealed to the public through popular culture. Norman Rockwell's painting series, the \"Four Freedoms\", toured in a war bond effort that raised $. Bond rallies were held throughout the country with famous celebrities, usually Hollywood film stars, to enhance the bond advertising effectiveness. Many motion pictures during the time, especially war dramas (a form of propaganda itself), included a graphic shown during the closing credits advising patrons to \"Buy War Bonds and Stamps\", which were sometimes sold in the lobby of the theater. The Music Publishers Protective Association encouraged its members to include patriotic messages on the front of their sheet music like \"Buy U.S. Bonds and Stamps\". Over the course of the war 85 million Americans purchased bonds totalling approximately $.\n\nThe National Service Board for Religious Objectors offered civilian bonds in the United States during World War II, primarily to members of the historic peace churches as an alternative for those who could not conscientiously buy something meant to support the war. These were U.S. Government Bonds not labelled as defense bonds. In all, 33,006 subscriptions were sold for a total value of $, mostly to Mennonites, Brethren, and Quakers.\n\n"}
