In 1916 and 1917 Tate studied the violin at the Cincinnati Conservatory of Music.\n\nHe began attending Vanderbilt University in 1918, where he met fellow poet Robert Penn Warren. Warren and Tate were invited to join an informal literary group of young Southern poets under the leadership of John Crowe Ransom; the group were known as the Fugitives. Tate contributed to the group's magazine \"The Fugitive\". The aim of the group, according to the critic J. A. Bryant, was \"to demonstrate that a group of southerners could produce important work in the medium [of poetry], devoid of sentimentality and carefully crafted,\" and they wrote in the formalist tradition that valued the skillful use of meter and rhyme.\n\nWhen Robert Penn Warren left Rhodes College to accept a position at Louisiana State University, he recommended Tate to replace him. Tate accepted the position, and spent 1934-36 as lecturer in English at Rhodes.\n\nTate also joined Ransom to teach at Kenyon College in Gambier, Ohio. Some of his notable students there included the poets Robert Lowell and Randall Jarrell. Lowell's early poetry was particularly influenced by Tate's formalist brand of Modernism.\n\nIn 1924, Tate moved to New York City where he met poet Hart Crane, with whom he had been exchanging correspondence for some time. Over a four-year period, he worked freelance for \"The Nation\", contributed to the \"Hound & Horn\", \"Poetry\" magazine, and others. To make ends meet, he worked as a janitor. (Some years later, he would also contribute articles to the conservative \"National Review\".)\n\nDuring a summer visit with the poet Robert Penn Warren in Kentucky, he began a relationship with writer Caroline Gordon. The two lived together in Greenwich Village, but moved to \"Robber Rocks\", a house in Patterson, New York, with friends Slater Brown and his wife Sue, Hart Crane, and Malcolm Cowley.\n\nTate married Gordon in New York in May 1925. Their daughter Nancy was born in September. In 1928, along with others New York City friends, he went to Europe. In London, he visited with T. S. Eliot, whose poetry and criticism he greatly admired, and he also visited Paris.\n\nIn 1928, Tate published his first book of poetry, \"Mr. Pope and Other Poems\", which contained his most famous poem, \"Ode to the Confederate Dead\" (not to be confused with \"\" by the Civil War poet Henry Timrod). That same year, Tate also published a biography \"Stonewall Jackson: The Good Soldier\".\n\nJust before leaving for Europe in 1928, Tate described himself to John Gould Fletcher as \"an enforced atheist\". He later told Fletcher, \"I am an atheist, but a religious one — which means that there is no organization for my religion.\" He regarded secular attempts to develop a system of thought for the modern world as misguided. \"Only God,\" he insisted, \"can give the affair a genuine purpose.\" In his essay \"The Fallacy of Humanism\" (1929), he criticized the New Humanists for creating a value system without investing it with any identifiable source of authority. \"Religion is the only technique for the validation of values,\" he wrote. Although he was attracted to Roman Catholicism, he deferred converting. Louis D. Rubin, Jr. observes that Tate may have waited \"because he realized that for him at this time it would be \"only\" a strategy, an intellectual act\".\n\nIn 1929, Tate published a second biography \"Jefferson Davis: His Rise and Fall\".\n\nAfter two years abroad, he returned to the United States, and in 1930 was back in Tennessee. Here he took up residence at Riverview, an antebellum mansion with an 85-acre estate attached, that had been bought for him by one of his brothers, \"who had made a lot of northern money out of coal.\" He resumed his senior position with the Fugitives.\n\nAlong with fellow Fugitives, Warren and Ransom, as well as nine other Southern writers, Tate also joined the conservative political group known as the Southern Agrarians. The group was made up of 12 members who published essays on their political philosophy in the book \"I'll Take My Stand\" published in 1930. Tate contributed the essay, \"Remarks on the Southern Religion\" to \"I'll Take My Stand\". This book was followed in 1938 by \"Who Owns America?\", the Southern Agrarians' response to The New Deal.\n\nDuring this time, Tate also became the \"de facto\" associate editor of \"The American Review\", which was published and edited by Seward Collins. Tate believed \"The American Review\" could popularize the work of the Southern Agrarians. He objected to Collins's open support of Benito Mussolini and Adolf Hitler, and condemned Fascism in an article in \"The New Republic\" in 1936. Much of Tate's major volumes of poetry were published in the 1930s, and the scholar David Havird describes this publication history in poetry as follows: By 1937, when he published his first \"Selected Poems\", Tate had written all of the shorter poems upon which his literary reputation came to rest. This collection--which brought together work from two recent volumes, \"Poems: 1928-1931\" (1932) and the privately printed \"The Mediterranean and Other Poems\" (1936), as well as the early \"Mr. Pope\"--included \"Mother and Son,\" \"Last Days of Alice,\" \"The Wolves,\" \"The Mediterranean,\" \"Aeneas at Washington,\" \"Sonnets at Christmas,\" and the final version of \"Ode to the Confederate Dead.\"\n\nIn 1938 Tate published his only novel, \"The Fathers\", which drew upon knowledge of his mother's ancestral home and family in Fairfax County, Virginia.\n\nTate and Gordon were divorced in 1945 and remarried in 1946. Though devoted to one another for life, they could not get along and later divorced again.\n\nTate was a poet-in-residence at Princeton University until 1942. He founded the Creative Writing program at Princeton, and mentored Richard Blackmur, John Berryman, and others. In 1942, Tate assisted novelist and friend Andrew Lytle in transforming \"The Sewanee Review\", America's oldest literary quarterly, from a modest journal into one of the most prestigious in the nation. Tate and Lytle had attended Vanderbilt together prior to collaborating at The University of the South.\n\nIn 1950, Tate converted to Roman Catholicism. He also married the poet Isabella Gardner in the early 1950s.\n\nWhile teaching at the University of Minnesota in Minneapolis, he met Helen Heinz, a nun enrolled in one of his courses and began an affair with her. Tate divorced Gardner and married Heinz in 1966. They moved to Sewanee, Tennessee. In 1967, Tate became the father of twin sons. The youngest died at eleven months from an accident. A third son was born in 1969. Tate died in Nashville, Tennessee ten years later. His papers are collected at the Firestone Library at Princeton University.\n\nLiterary scholars have questioned the relationship between the cultural attitudes of Modernist poets on issue such as race and the writing produced by these poets. The decade of the 1930s saw Tate's most notable stances on matters that may or may not be connected to literary craft. For example, though Tate spoke well of the work of fellow Modernist poet Langston Hughes, in 1931, Tate pressured his colleague Thomas Mabry into canceling a reception for Hughes, comparing the idea of socializing with the black poet to meeting socially with his black cook.\nFrom the 1930s until as late as the 1960s, Tate held prejudices against both blacks and Jews. He expressed views against interracial marriage and miscegenation and refused to associate with Black writers (like the aforementioned Langston Hughes). Up until the 1960s, Tate also believed in white supremacy.\nIn 1933, Tate wrote a letter for \"Hound & Horn\" explaining his views on interracial sex. \"The negro race is an inferior race...miscegenation due to a white woman and a negro man\" threatened the white family. \"Our purpose..is to keep the negro blood from passing into the white race.\"\nAccording to the critic Ian Hamilton, Tate and his co-agrarians had been more than ready at the time to overlook the anti-Semitism of the \"American Review\" in order to promote their 'spiritual' defence of the Deep South's traditions. In a 1934 review, \"A View of the Whole South\" Tate reviews W. T. Couch's \"Culture in The South: A Symposium by Thirty-one Authors\" and defends racial hegemony: \"I argue it this way: the white race seems determined to rule the Negro race in its midst; I belong to the white race; therefore I intend to support white rule. Lynching is a symptom of weak, inefficient rule; but you can't destroy lynching by fiat or social agitation; lynching will disappear when the white race is satisfied that its supremacy will not be questioned in social crises.\" \n\nAccording to the poetry editor of \"The New Criterion\", David Yezzi, Tate held the conventional social views of a white Southerner in 1934: an \"inherited racism, a Southern legacy rooted in place and time that Tate later renounced.\" Tate was born of a Scotch-Irish lumber manager whose business failures required moving several times per year, Tate said of his upbringing \"\"we might as well have been living, and I been born, in a tavern at a crossroads.\" However, his views on race were not passively incorporated; Thomas Underwood documents Tate's pursuit of racist ideology: \"Tate also drew ideas from nineteenth-century proslavery theorists such as Thomas Roderick Dew, a professor at The College of William and Mary, and William Harper, of the University of South Carolina — \"We must revive these men, he said.\"\n\n\n"}

Despite a late challenge by Texas Senator Ted Cruz, Donald Trump won the primary and netted all 58 delegates in the winner-take-all contest.\nOn the same day were held Democratic and Green primaries in Arizona, as well as Republican and Democratic caucuses in Utah and Idaho Democratic caucus, so the day was dubbed \"Western Tuesday\" by media.\n\nThere was controversy surrounding the Arizona primary elections of 2016, specifically having to do with the decrease in polling places in Maricopa County from 200 in 2012 to only 60 in 2016, despite the number of registered voters having increased from 300,000 in 2012 to 800,000 in 2016. This decrease in polling places was most pronounced in minority neighborhoods, most notably Latino neighborhoods, with areas like Central Phoenix having only one polling place for 108,000 voters. There were also reports of voters who had been previously registered coming up as unregistered or registered as an independent, making them ineligible to vote in the closed primary. Voters who did manage to vote had to stand in long lines to cast their ballots, some for as long as five hours. Additionally, voters reported being required to vote with a provisional ballot. In 2005, Arizona threw out 27,878 provisional ballots, counting only about 72.5% of the total provisional ballots reported. Taking into account the effects of the Supreme Court's \"gutting of the Voting Rights Act\", it's unknown what percentage of the provisional ballots were counted in 2016. This was the first election in the state of Arizona since the 2013 Supreme Court decision to strike down Section 5 of the Voting Rights Act of 1965, which would have previously required states with a history of voter discrimination, including Arizona, to receive Federal approval before implementing any changes to voting laws and practices.\n\nWithin a day after the election took place on March 22, a petition went viral on the White House petitions site asking the Department of Justice to investigate voter suppression and election fraud in Arizona. The petition reached 100,000 signatures in 40 hours, and as of June 5, 2016, nearly 220,000 people have signed the petition. The White House responded on May 20, 2016. In addition, Phoenix mayor Greg Stanton asked the Justice Department to launch an investigation into the allegations of voter suppression.\n\nThe Department of Justice has since launched a federal investigation into the primary.\n\nDonald Trump won Arizona decisively, netting all 58 delegates and carrying all counties in the state but two. As The New York Times described, \"Mr. Trump proved his appeal among immigration hard-liners, who make up a large bloc of Republicans in the border state.\"\n\nTrump won the populous cities of Phoenix in Maricopa County, and Tucson in Pima County. He enjoyed support from former Arizona Governor Jan Brewer and Maricopa County Sheriff Joe Arpaio, both of whom hold a hard-line stance against immigration. As Eric Bradner of CNN described, \"Their decision to side with Trump, and the size of his win, underscores the potency of Trump's build-a-wall plan with the Republican base.\"\n"}

A group of consumers take upon themselves to reduce the price of some good or service, and act collectively. This could include collectively engaging in shoplifting, avoiding paying transit fares or for tickets to enter movies, or calling in sick for work. The targeted service or product is generally considered by activists as being essential and should be available on an equal basis for all people. Critics of autoreduction do not distinguish between this type of practice and criminal theft or robberies.\n\nThis action takes various forms of non-payment for transportation or goods in supermarkets. It can result from refusal to include an increase in rent or utilities such as electricity, gas, or water. It may be done with the aim of redistributing goods to those in need.\n\nIn Italy, rent strikes are numerous and affected several large cities (Rome, Milan, and Turin) in the mid-1970s. This reappropriation of the proletarian practice was systematized by the autonomous movement also spoke of immediate communism. In France, this was the case in the rent strike in Sonacotra in 1975.\n\nThe Autonomia movement in 1977 involved activities of autoreduction, and had the result of spaces being created where principles like anti-capitalism are popular, among the related themes in punk and hardcore music.\n\nAfter a lull in the practice of this type of action, there was a renewed interest in 2008: the social crisis caused by market speculation appears to be a favorable environment for the revival of the practice. In late 2008, several autoreductions were organized by politicized groups with precarious workers, unemployed, intermittent, and students in struggle, including Paris, Rennes, and Grenoble.\n\nAutoreduction may also be done regarding food in supermarkets. The action involves shopping for foods and refusing to pay. After blocking checkout lanes in protest, dialogue is initiated with management. The militants rely on the time of blocking the credit union that may represent a loss to the company based on the amount of requisitioned products in shopping carts, as some customers decide to abandon their purchases because of the situation. If management agrees to allow the militants to leave with their carts, it is not legally a flight, but extortion. Requisitioned products are then collectively shared or distributed in neighborhoods, to show the militant and selfless character of the action.\n\nThe practice of autoreduction in public transportation is to travel in large numbers via public transit without paying, and distributing leaflets among passengers traveling at the same time. The stated aim is to make this type of transport free in the city, as it may already be in other cities in the country. This approach has an ecological dimension, with a view that free public transport would encourage its use and reduce the number of cars in the city, thereby reducing pollution. This type of action has been taken over by militant environmental movements in the Camp for Climate Action, for example.\n\n\"This article is based on the from the French Wikipedia, consulted on 8 August 2016.\"\n"}

A caretaker government is expected to conduct itself in accordance with a series of well-defined conventions that are administered by the Prime Minister's Department, although there is no law compelling the caretaker government to do so.\n\nMalaysian constitutional practice calls for a government to continue in office even after parliament has been dissolved, during the election period and then into the next parliament only until the next government can be formed. The prime minister can, however, resign office and advise the Yang di-Pertuan Agong at any time to appoint a new federal government. The operation of the Malaysian political system ensures that a Cabinet is always maintained and that caretaker governments abide by the conventions. \n\nA caretaker government operates until the election result clearly indicates that either the incumbent party or coalition has retained power, or in the case where there is to be a change of government, until the new government is appointed by the Yang di-Pertuan Agong. These conventions are not legally binding, and do not constitute \"hard and fast rules.\" In practice, any flouting of the conventions by a caretaker government would immediately come to light, and could go against them in the election campaign.\n\nThe Caretaker provisions explicitly recognise that, after the dissolution of parliament, the business of government must continue and that \"ordinary matters of administration\" must be addressed. Hence the provisions allow for the normal operations of all government departments. However, the caretaker conventions impose some restrictions on the conduct of the caretaker government. The conventions broadly include the following:\n\nWhen an opposition party or coalition wins enough seats at a general election to be able to command a majority in the Dewan Rakyat, the convention is for the incumbent prime minister (still in caretaker mode) to formally advise the Yang di-Pertuan Agong that he or she is no longer able to govern, and that the Leader of the Opposition should be invited to form a government. The Yang di-Pertuan Agong then requests the incumbent prime minister and his or her ministers to remain in office on a caretaker basis until a new government is sworn in. The Yang di-Pertuan Agong then contacts the Leader of the Opposition and invites them to form a government. The Leader of the Opposition accepts the invitation, and undertakes to inform the Yang di-Pertuan Agong when the new Cabinet is in a position to be sworn in. This can be delayed by the counting of votes in closely contested seats, or by the processes by which ministers are chosen under the relevant party's rules. In the meantime, the caretaker government continues in office.\n\nThe same condition of caretaker government also apply to the thirteen states of Malaysia. A caretaker government at state level is a state government during a period that starts when the state assembly is dissolved by the sultan / raja / governor prior to a state election, and continues for a period after the election, until the next executive council (known as cabinet in Sabah and Sarawak) is appointed. A caretaker government at state level is expected to conduct itself in accordance with a series of well-defined conventions that are administered by the State Secretariat, although there is no law compelling the caretaker government at state level to do so.\n\nMalaysian constitutional practice calls for a state government to continue in office even after state assembly has been dissolved, during the election period and then into the next state assembly only until the next state government can be formed.

Chlorophyll is present in green leafy vegetables and reaching levels as high as 5.7% in spinach.

{"id": "175519", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=175519", "title": "Escheat", "text": "Escheat\n\nEscheat is a common law doctrine that transfers the real property of a person who died without heirs to the Crown or state. It serves to ensure that property is not left in \"limbo\" without recognized ownership. It originally applied to a number of situations where a legal interest in land was destroyed by operation of law, so that the ownership of the land reverted to the immediately superior feudal lord.\n\nThe term \"escheat\" derives ultimately from the Latin \"ex-cadere\", to \"fall-out\", via mediaeval French \"escheoir\". The sense is of a feudal estate in land falling-out of the possession by a family into possession by the overlord.\n\nIn feudal England, escheat referred to the situation where the tenant of a fee (or \"fief\") died without an heir or committed a felony. In the case of such demise of a tenant-in-chief, the fee reverted to the King's demesne permanently, when it became once again a mere tenantless plot of land, but could be re-created as a fee by enfeoffment to another of the king's followers. Where the deceased had been subinfeudated by a tenant-in-chief, the fee reverted temporarily to the crown for one year and one day by right of \"primer seisin\" after which it escheated to the over-lord who had granted it to the deceased by enfeoffment. From the time of Henry III, the monarchy took particular interest in escheat as a source of revenue.\n\nAt the Norman Conquest of England all the land of England was claimed as the personal possession of William the Conqueror under allodial title. The monarch thus became the sole \"owner\" of all the land in the kingdom, a position which persists to the present day. He then granted it out to his favoured followers, who thereby became tenants-in-chief, under various contracts of feudal land tenure. Such tenures, even the highest one of \"feudal barony\", never conferred ownership of land but merely ownership of rights over it, that is to say ownership of an estate in land. Such persons are therefore correctly termed \"land-holders\" or \"tenants\" (from Latin \"teneo\" to hold), not owners. If held freely, that is to say by freehold, such holdings were heritable by the holder's legal heir. On the payment of a premium termed feudal relief to the treasury, such heir was entitled to demand re-enfeoffment by the king with the fee concerned.\n\nWhere no legal heir existed, the logic of the situation was that the fief had ceased to exist as a legal entity, since being tenantless no one was living who had been enfeoffed with the land, and the land was thus technically owned by either the crown or the immediate overlord (where the fee had been subinfeudated by the tenant-in-chief to a mesne lord, and perhaps the process of subinfeudation had been continued by a lower series of mesne-lords) as ultimus heres. Logically therefore it was in the occupation of the crown alone, that is to say in the royal demesne. This was the basic operation of an escheat (excadere), a failure of heirs.\n\nEscheat could also take place if a tenant was outlawed or convicted of a felony, when the King could exercise the ancient right of wasting the criminal's land for a year and a day, and after that the land would return to the lord. (However, one guilty of treason (rather than felony) forfeited all lands to the King. John and his heirs frequently insisted on seizing \"terrae Normannorum\", \"lands of the Normans\", the English land of those who preferred to be Normans rather than Englishmen when the victories of Philip Augustus forced a proclamation of allegiance.) Since disavowal of a feudal bond was considered a felony, lords could escheat land from those who refused to be true to their feudal services. On the other hand, there were tenants who were sluggish in performing their duties, while not being outright rebellious against the lord. Remedies in the courts against this sort of thing, even in Bracton's day, were available, but were considered laborious and frequently ineffectual in compelling the desired performance. The commonest mechanism would be distraint, also called distress (districtio): the lord would seize some chattel, and hold it until performance was achieved. This practice had been dealt with in the 1267 Statute of Marlborough. Even so, it remained the most common extrajudicial method applied by the lords at the time of Quia Emptores.\n\nThus, under English common law, there were two main ways an escheat could happen:\n\nFrom the 12th century onward, the Crown appointed \"escheators\" to manage escheats and report to the Exchequer, with one escheator per county established by the middle of the 14th century. Upon the death of a tenant-in-chief, the escheator would be instructed by a writ of \"diem clausit extremum\" (\"he has closed his last day\", i.e. he is dead) issued by the king's chancery, to empanel a jury to hold an \"inquisition \"post mortem\"\" to ascertain who the legal heir was, if any, and what was the extent of the land held. Thus it would be revealed whether the king had any rights to the land. It was also important for the king to know who the heir was, and to assess his personal qualities, since he would thenceforth form a constituent part of the royal army, if he held under military tenure. If there was any doubt, the escheator would seize the land and refer the case to the king's court where it would be settled, ensuring that not one day's revenue would be lost. This would be a source of concern with land-holders when there were delays from the court.\n\nMost common-law jurisdictions have abolished the concept of feudal land tenure of property, and so the concept of escheat has lost something of its meaning. In England and Wales, the possibility of escheat of a deceased person's property to the feudal overlord was abolished by the Administration of Estates Act 1925; however, the concept of Bona vacantia means that the crown (or Duchy of Cornwall or Duchy of Lancaster) can still receive such property if no-one else can be found who is eligible to inherit it.\n\nThe term is often now applied to the transfer of the title to a person's property to the state when the person dies intestate without any other person capable of taking the property as heir. For example, a common-law jurisdiction's intestacy statute might provide that when someone dies without a will, and is not survived by a spouse, descendants, parents, grandparents, descendants of parents, children or grandchildren of grandparents, or great-grandchildren of grandparents, then the person's estate will escheat to the state.\n\nIn some jurisdictions, escheat can also occur when an entity, typically a bank, credit union or other financial institution, holds money or property which appears to be unclaimed, for instance due to a lack of activity on the account by way of deposits, withdrawals or any other transactions for a lengthy time in a cash account. In many jurisdictions, if the owner cannot be located, such property can be revocably escheated to the state.\n\nIn commerce, it is the process of reassigning legal title in unclaimed or abandoned payroll checks, insurance payouts, or stocks and shares whose owners cannot be traced, to a state authority (in the United States). A company is required to file unclaimed property reports with its state annually and, in some jurisdictions, to make a good-faith effort to find the owners of their dormant accounts. The escheating criteria are set by individual state regulations.\n\nEscheat can still occur in England and Wales, if a person is made bankrupt or a corporation is liquidated. Usually this means that all the property held by that person is 'vested in' (transferred to) the Official Receiver or Trustee in Bankruptcy. However, it is open to the Receiver or Trustee to refuse to accept that property by disclaiming it. It is relatively common for a trustee in bankruptcy to disclaim freehold property which may give rise to a liability, for example the common parts of a block of flats owned by the bankrupt would ordinarily pass to the trustee to be realised in order to pay his debts, but the property may give the landlord an obligation to spend money for the benefit of lessees of the flats. The bankruptcy of the original owner means that the freehold is no longer the bankrupt's legal property, and the disclaimer destroys the freehold estate, so that the land ceases to be owned by anyone and effectively escheats to become land held by the Crown in demesne. This situation affects a few hundred properties each year.\n\nAlthough such escheated property is owned by the Crown, it is not part of the Crown Estate, unless the Crown (through the Crown Estate Commissioners) 'completes' the escheat, by taking steps to exert rights as owner. However, usually, in the example given above, the tenants of the flats, or their mortgagees would exercise their rights given by the Insolvency Act 1986 to have the freehold property transferred to them. This is the main difference between escheat and \"bona vacantia\", as in the latter, a grant takes place automatically, with no need to 'complete' the transaction.\n\nOne consequence of the Land Registration Act 1925 was that only estates in land (freehold or leasehold) could be registered. Land held directly by the Crown, known as property in the \"royal demesne\", is not held under any vestigial feudal tenure (the crown has no historical overlord other than, for brief periods, the papacy) and there is therefore no estate to register. This had the consequence that freeholds which escheated to the Crown ceased to be registrable. This created a slow drain of property out of registration, amounting to some hundreds of freehold titles in each year.\n\nThe problem was noted by the Law Commission in their report \"Land Registration for the Twenty-First Century\". The Land Registration Act 2002 was passed in response to that report. It provides that land held in demesne by the Crown may be registered.\n\nEscheatment is the process of returning lost or unclaimed property to state’s governments for safekeeping until the owner(s) is identified. Jurisdiction for the state is determined by last known address. Every state has laws regarding escheatment, whose holding periods typically range around five years. The concept behind escheatment is that all property has a legally recognized owner. If the owner cannot be found in a timely manner, then the government is presumed to be the owner. Escheats are performed on what is called a \"revocable basis\". This means if lost property is escheated to a state, then the original owner is subsequently found, the original escheat is revoked and ownership of the property returns to the rightful owner.\n\nAccording to SEC Rule 17 CFR 240.17f-1: Transfer Agents are obligated by the SEC to report to Commission (specifically to its designee; the SEC's Securities Information System) anytime a certificate is known to be lost or missing for at least 2 days. Transfer Agents must search for the holder's SSN or EIN utilizing an information database system, or if not available, exercise their best effort to match the holder's name and address through these systems. \"All\" Transfer Agents \"must\" report \"all\" lost or missing certificates/shareholders on their own annual filings.\n\n\n"}

It was created on 15 November 1920 in accordance with the 1919 Treaty of Versailles after the end of World War I and was under League of Nations protection. The Free City was primarily inhabited by ethnic Germans but the majority fled or were expelled when the territory was incorporated into Poland at the conclusion of World War II.\n\nOn 13 November 1947, W. Richter, the chairman of the Association of Nationals of Danzig Free State, announced the formation of a government-in-exile for the Free City of Danzig. The government made pleas to the United Nations, calling for official recognition, the deportation of Poles from its claimed territory, and assistance in reestablishing the Free City. Richter also announced that the association would accept a settlement from the international community that would grant them an alternative territory in a center of commerce. The legislative body of the government in exile, the \"Rat der Danziger\" (Council of Danzig), was established that year. In 1951 and 1961, it was supposedly recognized in secret by Danzig expatriates as the \"legal successor of the Senate of the Free City of Danzig.\"\n\nThe Free State of Danzig government is based in Berlin, Germany. It respects the original Constitution of the Free City of Danzig. The official government website is run by the incumbent Head of Foreign Affairs, Senator Ernst F. Kriesner. The government's legislature takes the form of a parliament, the \"Rat der Danziger\" (Council of Danzig), which has 36 members and claims to represent the interests of German Danzigers. Members of the council are elected by Danzig expatriates and their descendants by a mailed-in ballot.\n\nA formal letter was sent to the United Nations in 1998 by Senator Kriesner requesting official recognition.\n\nWriting on the lack of official German recognition of the Free City of Danzig Government in Exile, Polish Foreign Minister Władysław Bartoszewski stated that the organization and like-minded Danzig cultural associations were seen in the eyes of the German public as revanchist and politically aligned with the far-right National Democratic Party of Germany.\n\nThe government lays claims to the entire territory once possessed by the Free City of Danzig. It bases the legitimacy of its assertion upon the notion that the Free City of Danzig was a neutral state and that its annexation by Germany in 1939 was illegal; as such, the Allies had no authority in incorporating the city into Poland after World War II. In addition to this, no formal treaty has ever altered the status of the Free City of Danzig, and its incorporation into Poland has rested upon the general acquiescence of the international community.\n\n"}

The protests were inspired by Vida Movahed (), an Iranian woman known as the Girl of Enghelab Street (), who stood in the crowd on a utility box in the Enghelab Street (Revolution Street) of Tehran on 28 December 2017, tied her hijab, a white headscarf, to a stick, and waved it to the crowd as a flag. She was arrested on that day and was released temporary on bail a month later, on 28 January 2018. Some people believe that Movahed's action was based on Masih Alinejad's call for White Wednesdays, a protest movement that the presenter at VOA Persian Television started in early 2017. Other women later re-enacted her protest and posted photos of their actions on social media. These women are described as the \"Girls of Enghelab Street\" and \"The Girls Of Revolution Street\" in English sources. Some of the protesters claim that they didn't follow Masih Alinejad's call.\n\nIn the Islamic law of Iran imposed shortly after the 1979 Islamic revolution, article 638 of 5th book of Islamic Penal Code (called Sanctions and deterrent penalties) women who do not wear a hijab may be imprisoned from ten days to two months, and/or required to pay fines from 50,000 up to 500,000 rials. Fines are recalculated in the courts as the value of Iranian rials drops every year since 1979.\n\nArticle 639 of the same book says, two type of people shall be sentenced to one year to 10 years imprisonment, first a person who establishes or directs a place of immorality or prostitution, second a person who facilitates or encourages people to commit immorality or prostitution.\n\nThese are some of the laws under which some protesters were charged.\n\nBefore the Iranian Islamic Revolution of 1979 (during the reign of Mohammad Reza Pahlavi, the last Shah of Iran) the hijab was not compulsory, though some Iranian women during this period wore headscarfs or chador.\n\nAfter the 1979 Islamic revolution, the hijab gradually became compulsory. In 1979, Ruhollah Khomeini announced that women should observe Islamic dress code; His statement sparked demonstrations, which were met by government assurances that the statement was only a recommendation. Hijab was subsequently made mandatory in government and public offices in 1980, and in 1983 it became mandatory for all women.\n\nIn 2018, a government run survey dating back to 2014, was released by President Hassan Rouhani, showing that 49.8% of Iranians were against compulsory or mandatory hijab. The report was released by the Center for Strategic Studies, the research arm of the Iranian President's office, and was titled \"Report of the first hijab special meeting\" on July 2014 in a PDF format.\n\nOn 2 February 2018 a poll conducted by the Center for International and Security Studies at Maryland (CISSM) showed that a few Iranians agreed with \"changing Iran's political system or relaxing strict Islamic law\".\n\nIran is the only country in the world that requires non-Muslim women to wear a headscarf. For example, in January 2018, a Chinese female musician was forcibly veiled in the middle of her concert performance.\n\nOn 28 December 2017, pictures and videos of Movahed waving her scarf went viral through the hashtag \"Where_is_she?\" (, \"Where is the girl of Enghelab Street\" in Persian) on social media. While at first she was unknown, days later, Nasrin Sotoudeh, the human rights activist and lawyer who has also been arrested, found out that the girl is 31 years old and was arrested on the spot with her 19-month-old baby.\n\nOn 28 January 2018, according to Nasrin Sotoudeh, the lawyer investigating the case, Vida Movahed was released; temporary on bail.\n\nOn 29 January 2018, a woman was arrested in Tehran after re-enacting Movahed's protest by standing on the same utility box in Enqelab Street, taking off her white Hijab, and holding it up on a stick. Photos has been posted on social media show that at least three other women re-enacted Movahed's protest in Tehran on 29 January, including one near Ferdowsi Square.\n\nAccording to Nasrin Sotoudeh on 30 January 2018, the second woman who was arrested on 29 January 2018 was Narges Hosseini (); her age is 32.\n\nOn 30 January 2018, several more women, but also men, protested against the compulsory hijab law by re-enacting Movahed's protest. This took place in Tehran, as well as other cities as well including Esfahan and Shiraz.\n\nOn 1st February 2018 the Iranian Police department announced they had arrested 29 women for taking off their hijab.\n\nAccording to Nasrin Sotoudeh, the Iranian lawyer, Narges Hosseini known as the second girl of Enghelab street, who is 32 years old was unable to pay the $135,000 USD bail set by the judge presiding over her case, facing a possible 10 years in prison and up to 74 lashes on charges including openly committing a sinful act.\n\nNew photos and video shared on social media shows another woman re-enacting Movahed's protest on the same street, Enghelab Street (Revolution Street) on 15 February 2018 was identified as Azam Jangravi (), videos shows that the police took her down aggressively. According to her latest Instagram picture, she said that she a part of Iranian women Reformists and Executives of Construction Party and has taken no orders from neither someone from inside nor outside the country, she said she has done that to protest against compulsory hijab.\n\nNarges Hosseini and Azam Jangravi were released from the custody temporary on bail.\n\nAnother female protester named Shaparak Shajarizadeh () was arrested protesting with a white scarf on Wednesday, 21 February 2018 in Gheytarieh street; eyewitnesses said that the police attacked her from behind and took her in custody.\n\nPhotos shared on social media shows that the government was placing an inverted v-shaped iron structure on the utility boxes so as to inhibit anyone standing on top of the boxes. She was sentenced to two years in prison in addition to an 18-year suspended prison term. In addition, she stated that she left Iran.\n\nAnother woman named Maryam Shariatmadari () was protesting compulsory hijab in the afternoon on a utility box; the police asked her to come down and the woman refused and questioned the police what's her crime, \"disturbing the peace\" the police replied. Then, as she was violently ejected by the police, she was injured and her leg was broken.\n\nShaparak Shajarizadeh was beaten up in custody. She was released later temporary on bail.\n\nEyewitnesses said that another women named Hamraz Sadeghi () was protesting compulsory hijab on Saturday, 24 February 2018 when suddenly she was attacked by an unknown security force, her arm was broken and was arrested.\n\nOn July 8, 2018, Iranian teenager Maedeh Hojabri was arrested after she posted videos of herself dancing to Western and Iranian music on her Instagram account without her headscarf.

{"id": "2273091", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2273091", "title": "Hamdan v. Rumsfeld", "text": "Hamdan v. Rumsfeld\n\nHamdan v. Rumsfeld, 548 U.S. 557 (2006), is a case in which the Supreme Court of the United States held that military commissions set up by the Bush administration to try detainees at Guantanamo Bay lack \"the power to proceed because its structures and procedures violate both the Uniform Code of Military Justice and the four Geneva Conventions signed in 1949.\" Specifically, the ruling says that Common Article 3 of the Geneva Conventions was violated.\n\nThe case considers whether the United States Congress may pass legislation preventing the Supreme Court from hearing the case of an accused combatant before his military commission takes place, whether the special military commissions which had been set up violated federal law (including the Uniform Code of Military Justice and treaty obligations), and whether courts can enforce the articles of the Geneva Conventions.\n\nAn unusual aspect of the case was an amicus brief filed by Senators Jon Kyl and Lindsey Graham, which presented an \"extensive colloquy\" added to the Congressional record as evidence that \"Congress was aware\" that the Detainee Treatment Act of 2005 would strip the Supreme Court of jurisdiction to hear cases brought by the Guantanamo detainees. Because these statements were not included in the December 21 debate at the time, Emily Bazelon of \"Slate\" magazine has argued that their brief was an attempt to mislead the court.\n\nOn June 29, 2006, the Court issued a 5–3 decision holding that it had jurisdiction, and that the administration did not have authority to set up these particular military commissions without congressional authorization, because they did not comply with the Uniform Code of Military Justice and the Geneva Conventions (which the court found to be incorporated into the Uniform Code of Military Justice).\n\nThe plaintiff was Salim Ahmed Hamdan, a citizen of Yemen who worked as a bodyguard and chauffeur for Osama bin Laden. Hamdan had formerly worked in Afghanistan on an agricultural project that Bin Laden had developed. Hamdan was captured by militia forces during the invasion of Afghanistan in the fall of 2001 and turned over to the United States. In 2002, he was sent by the US to its new Guantanamo Bay detention camp at its naval base in Cuba.\n\nIn July 2004, Hamdan was charged with conspiracy to commit terrorism, and the Bush administration made arrangements to try him before a military commission, established by the Department of Defense under Military Commission Order No. 1 of March 21, 2002. He was assigned a defense counsel, LCDR Charles D. Swift from the Navy JAG, who with a legal team filed a petition for Hamdan in US District Court for a writ of habeas corpus, challenging the constitutionality of the military commission, and saying that it lacked the protections required under the Geneva Conventions and United States Uniform Code of Military Justice.\n\nFollowing the United States Supreme Court ruling in \"Hamdi v. Rumsfeld\" (2004), which established that detainees had the right of \"habeas corpus\" to challenge their detention, Hamdan was granted a review before the Combatant Status Review Tribunal. It determined that he was eligible for detention by the United States as an enemy combatant or person of interest.\n\nThe defendants in this case included many United States government officials allegedly responsible for Hamdan's detention; the short name of the case includes only the first-named defendant, then-Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld.\n\nAfter reviewing Hamdan's habeas petition, Judge James Robertson of the United States District Court for the District of Columbia ruled in the detainee's favor. He found that the United States could not hold a military commission unless it was first shown that the detainee was not a prisoner of war.\n\nOn July 15, 2005, a United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit three-judge panel: A. Raymond Randolph, John Roberts and Stephen F. Williams, unanimously reversed the decision of the District Court. Judge Randolph, who wrote the decision, cited the following reasons for the legality of the military commission:\n\nOn November 7, 2005, the Supreme Court issued a writ of certiorari to hear the case. The petition was filed on behalf of Hamdan by Neal Katyal of Georgetown University Law Center and Lt. Commander Charles Swift of the U.S. Navy, an alumnus of Seattle University School of Law. The Seattle law firm Perkins Coie provided the additional legal counsel for Hamdan.\n\nThe case was argued before the court on March 28, 2006. Katyal argued on behalf of Hamdan, and Paul Clement, the Solicitor General of the United States, argued on behalf of the government. Chief Justice Roberts recused himself because he had previously ruled on this case as part of the three judge panel on the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit. Critics called for Justice Antonin Scalia to recuse himself, since he had made allegedly improper comments about the decision of the case prior to hearing oral arguments (\"I'm not about to give this man who was captured in a war a full jury trial. I mean it's crazy\") but he chose not to do so.\n\nThe Supreme Court announced its decision on June 29, 2006. The Court reversed the ruling of the Court of Appeals, holding that President George W. Bush did not have authority to set up the war crimes tribunals and finding the special military commissions illegal under both military justice law and the Geneva Conventions.\n\nAssociate Justice John Paul Stevens wrote the opinion for the Court, which commanded a majority only in part.\n\nThe Stevens opinion began with the issue of jurisdiction, denying the U.S. government's motion to dismiss under Section 1005 of the Detainee Treatment Act of 2005 (DTA), which gave the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals \"exclusive\" jurisdiction to review decisions of cases being tried before military commissions. Congress did not include language in the DTA that might have precluded Supreme Court jurisdiction, making the government's argument to the Court unpersuasive. The government's argument that \"Schlesinger v. Councilman\" 420 U.S. 738 (1975) precludes Supreme Court review was similarly rejected. \"Councilman\" applied to a member of the U.S. military who was being tried before a military \"court-martial\". In contrast, Hamdan is not a member of the U.S. military, and would be tried before a military \"commission\", not a court-martial. To the court, the more persuasive precedent was \"Ex parte Quirin\", in which the court recognized its duty to enforce relevant Constitutional protections by convening a special Term and expediting review of a trial by military convention. The opinion explicitly stated that, because DTA did not bar it from considering the petition, it was unnecessary to decide whether laws unconditionally barring habeas corpus petitions would unconstitutionally violate the Suspension Clause.\n\nThe opinion then addressed the substantive issues of the case. It explicitly did not decide whether the President possessed the Constitutional power to convene military commissions like the one created to try Hamdan. Even if he possessed such power, those tribunals would either have to be sanctioned by the \"laws of war\", as codified by Congress in Article 21 of the Uniform Code of Military Justice (UCMJ), or authorized by statute. As to the statutory authorization, there is nothing in the Authorization for Use of Military Force (AUMF) \"even hinting\" at expanding the President's war powers beyond those enumerated in Art. 21. Instead, the AUMF, the UCMJ, and the DTA \"at most acknowledge\" the President's authority to convene military commissions only where justified by the exigencies of war, but still operating within the laws of war.\n\nAs to the laws of war, to the majority these necessarily include the UCMJ and the Geneva Conventions, each of which require more protections than the military commission provides. The UCMJ, Art. 36 (b), requires that rules applied in courts-martial and military commissions be \"uniform insofar as practicable\". Stevens found several substantial deviations, including:\n\nThese deviations made the commissions violate the UCMJ.\n\nThe majority also found that the procedures in question violate the \"at least\" applicable Common Article 3 of the Geneva Conventions. It found that the D.C. Court of Appeals erred in concluding that the Conventions did not apply:\nBecause the military commission does not meet the requirements of the Uniform Code of Military Justice or of the Geneva Convention, it violates the laws of war and therefore cannot be used to try Hamdan.\n\nThe Court did not hear the question that had decided the district court opinion, namely that Hamdan was entitled to a GCIII Art. 5 hearing instead of a Combatant Status Review Tribunal.\n\nBecause Justice Anthony Kennedy did not join Stevens' opinion as to several parts, largely on the grounds of judicial parsimony (that is, having decided that the military commissions had no foundation, the core question of the case was decided and the Court did not need to go further), those sections were without a majority in support.\n\nIn one of these sections, Stevens addressed the issue of whether military commissions can try conspiracy charges. He argued that military commissions are not courts of general jurisdiction, which are able to try any crime; that the court has traditionally held that offenses against the law of war are triable by military commission only when they are clearly defined as war crimes by statute or strong common law precedent (cf. \"Quirin\"). Finally, he found that there was no support in statute or court precedent for law-of-war military commissions trying charges of \"conspiracy\", either in the Geneva Conventions, in the earlier Hague Conventions or at the Nuremberg Trials.\n\nAs is common in opinions to which there are dissents, Stevens' opinion addressed the major arguments in dissent. For example:\n\nJustice Breyer wrote a one-page concurring opinion, joined by Justices Kennedy, Souter, and Ginsburg. Breyer contended that the commissions are not necessarily categorically prohibited, as long as Congress approves them:\n\nJustice Kennedy wrote an opinion concurring in part, joined as to parts I and II by Justices Souter, Ginsburg, and Breyer.\n\nIn Part One of Kennedy's concurrence, he raises his concern for the separation of powers; specifically, how one branch can control all the elements of a case, including avenues of review and appeal.\n\nPart Two describes the differences between the procedures of the military commissions and the procedures prescribed by the UCMJ (fewer jury members, different rules of evidence, etc.). These differences demonstrate that the commissions do not operate under the rules of military courts-martial, and raise issues of neutrality with respect to the military judges involved. The negation of fairness safeguards renders the commission a judicial entity which is not a \"regularly constituted court\", as required in the Geneva Convention. In sum, Kennedy writes that the commission exceeds congressional bounds, though the Congress is free to re-write the law as they see fit.\n\nThe third and final Part lists some of Kennedy's reservations. He would not say that the defendant must be present at all stages of the trial. There should be a reluctance to consider the applicability of Article 75 of Protocol I, since the U.S. never signed it and thus it is not binding. Kennedy writes that he feels it was not necessary to delve into the validity of the conspiracy charge, and he expresses no view on the merits of the other limitations of the commission noted in Part V of the Decision.\n\nJustice Scalia wrote a dissenting opinion that focuses primarily on issues of jurisdiction, and was joined by Justices Thomas and Alito.\n\nScalia calls the Court's conclusion to hear the case \"patently erroneous\". His first argument relies on the part of the Detainee Treatment Act (DTA) (effective December 30, 2005) that states \"[N]o court, justice, or judge shall have jurisdiction to hear or consider an application for a writ of habeas corpus filed by or on behalf of an alien detained by the Department of Defense at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba.\" §1005(e)(1), 119 Stat. 2742. Scalia's opinion is that this clause suffices to deny the Supreme Court jurisdiction over the case, calling the majority's reading of the effectiveness provisions of §1005(h), a \"mess\". He cites \"Bruner v. United States\" and other cases granting \"immediate effect in pending cases, absent an explicit statutory reservation\". He wrote that in interpreting the language in the DTA, the majority ignored Supreme Court precedents which established that a statute excluding jurisdiction applies to pending cases unless it has clear language saying it does not. Scalia claimed that the majority had made this interpretation \"for the flimsiest of reasons\". He was referring to the majority's use of Senate floor debate records to bolster their interpretation, writing that it \"makes no difference\" that the language in support of his position was inserted into the Congressional Record after the law was voted upon. He also accuses the majority of ignoring the President's Signing Statement.\n\nFurthermore, he anticipates that expanding the jurisdictions able to hear writs of habeas corpus from Guantanamo Bay would create excessive load on the court system.\n\nIn addition, Scalia states that the original military tribunal was not shown to be inadequate. Regarding the application of the Suspension Clause of the Constitution, Scalia points to \"Johnson v. Eisentrager\".\n\nIn its second major argument, Scalia's opinion argues that petitioners such as Hamdan held outside the territorial jurisdiction of the United States lack the right to the writ of \"habeas corpus\". He points in a footnote to \"Hamdi v. Rumsfeld\", under which he claims Hamdan \"is already subject to indefinite detention\" \"after an adverse determination by his CSRT\".\n\nFinally, Justice Scalia chastises the Court for taking equity jurisdiction of the case and draws an analogy with \"Schlesinger v. Councilman\", 420 U.S. 738 (1975). In that case, the Supreme Court declined passing judgment on the decision of a military court-martial before it finished its work; Scalia argues that likewise, the military commissions in Cuba have not yet ended their work regarding Hamdan and therefore should not be subject to judicial oversight.\n\nJustice Clarence Thomas read his dissent from the bench when the decision was announced, the first time he did so since his dissent in \"Stenberg v. Carhart\", 530 U.S. 914 (2000).\n\nIn his dissent he asserted that the courts had no jurisdiction for this case for the reasons described in Scalia's dissent above; that Hamdan is an illegal combatant and therefore not protected by the Geneva convention; that the Geneva convention does not prohibit the special court council proposed; and that the President already had authority to set up the special court council proposed.\n\nCiting his dissent in \"Hamdi v. Rumsfeld\", Thomas briefly reprised the roles granted by the Constitution to the three different branches in time of war. He argued that under the framework established in \"Ex parte Quirin\" and \"Youngstown Sheet & Tube Co. v. Sawyer\", President Bush's decision to try Hamdan before a military commission \"is entitled to a heavy measure of deference\", inasmuch as Congress had authorized the President to use all necessary and appropriate force to prevent future acts of terrorism when it passed the Authorization for Use of Military Force.\n\nThomas disagreed strongly with the plurality's determination that the legality of the charges against Hamdan are doubtful because he was charged \"not with an overt act for which he was caught redhanded ... but with an 'agreement' the inception of which long predated ... the [relevant armed conflict]\". He lambasted the plurality for second-guessing the Executive's judgment, arguing that the Court's disagreement was based upon \"little more than its unsupported assertions\" and constituted \"an unprecedented departure from the traditionally limited role of the courts with respect to war and an unwarranted intrusion on executive authority\". Thomas further disagreed with the plurality's assumption that the date of the enactment of the AUMF constituted the start of war, suggesting that Osama bin Laden's declaration of jihad in August 1996 could be considered a declaration of war. Under this view, the enactment by Congress of the AUMF did not mark the beginning of the conflict with al Qaeda, but rather authorized the Executive to use force to combat it. Additionally, Thomas wrote that under the common law of war, which is \"flexible and evolutionary in nature\", war courts are permitted a degree of latitude in their jurisdiction. In holding otherwise, the plurality failed to properly defer to the judgment of the Executive and military commanders.\n\nReferring to the Court's recent decision in \"Rapanos v. United States\", Thomas noted with some incredulity that while the Justices in the instant decision \"disregard[ed] the commander-in-chief's wartime decisions\", they had no trouble deferring to the judgment of the Corps of Engineers in upholding the agency's \"wildly implausible conclusion that a storm drain is a tributary of the waters of the United States\". He added that \"It goes without saying that there is much more at stake here than storm drains.\"\n\nThomas likewise disagreed with the plurality's holding that even if the government had charged Hamdan with a crime that was clearly cognizable by military commission, the commission would still lack power to proceed because it does not comply with the terms of the UCMJ and the four Geneva Conventions signed in 1949. He again emphasized that the jurisdiction of military commissions is not prescribed by statute but is rather \"adapted in each instance to the need that called it forth\". Thomas argued that the Court's conclusion that Article 36 of the UCMJ amounts to an attempt by Congress to curb the Executive's power is \"contrary to the text and structure of the UCMJ\" and also inconsistent with prior decisions of the Court. Addressing Hamdan's claims under the Geneva Convention, Thomas argued that these are foreclosed by the Court's holding in \"Johnson v. Eisentrager\", where the majority noted that the respondents could not assert \"that anything in the Geneva Convention makes them immune from prosecution or punishment for war crimes\". Further, even if Hamdan's claim under Common Article 3 was not foreclosed by \"Eisentrager\", it is nevertheless meritless insofar as the President has accepted the determination of the Department of Justice that Common Article 3 of Geneva does not extend to al Qaeda detainees. Thomas asserted that the Court's duty in this instance to \"defer to the President's understanding of the provision at issue\" is made even more acute by the fact that he is acting pursuant to his authority as Commander-in-Chief.\n\nIn a seven page dissent, Alito sided with Thomas and Scalia's explanation of why they believe the courts had no jurisdiction for this case. He explained why he believed the military commission in this case was legal. Alito disagreed with the holding of the Court which found that military commissions did not meet the definition of \"a regularly constituted court\" as required in Common Article 3 of the Geneva Conventions. Alito argued that Common Article 3 was satisfied in \"Hamdan\" because the military commissions:\n\nAlito specifically disagreed with the opinions supporting the judgment which held that the military commission before which Hamdan would be tried is not \"a regularly constituted court\", and that the military commission is \"illegal\", because the commission's procedures allegedly would not comply with . Alito wrote that the military commission was \"regularly\" or \"properly\" constituted, using the example of the various types of local, state, federal and international courts and how \"although these courts are 'differently constituted' and differ substantially in many other respects, they are all 'regularly constituted.'\"\n\nAlito stated that Geneva Convention Common Article 3 does not specifically rule out military commissions, and further points to the commentary in Article 66, which was the article the Court used in support of its opinion. Alito argued that even if Common Article 3 recognizes a prohibition on \"special tribunals\", which Article 66 does prohibit, such a prohibition is not applicable to Hamdan's tribunal because the military commissions were \"regular\". Further, because the Bush Administration might conduct the hundreds of such tribunals according to the same procedures, Alito concluded that \"it seems that petitioner's tribunal, like the hundreds of others respondents propose to conduct, is very much regular and not at all special.\"\n\nAlito wrote that \"the commissions were appointed, set up, and established pursuant to an order of the President, just like the commission in \"Ex parte Quirin\", 317 U. S. 1 (1942), and the Court acknowledges that \"Quirin\" recognized that the statutory predecessor of 'preserved' the President's power 'to convene military commissions.'\" Alito disagreed with Kennedy's assertion that \"an acceptable degree of independence from the Executive is necessary to render a commission 'regularly constituted' by the standards of our Nation's system of justice\", arguing that Kennedy \"offers no support for this proposition (which in any event seems to be more about fairness or integrity than regularity)\", and further arguing that the commission in \"Quirin\" was no different from the present case.\n\nFinally, Alito wrote that the commission procedures as a whole do not provide a basis for deeming the commissions to be illegitimate. He points to two procedural rules, which the Court found fault with: First, the rule \"allowing the Secretary of Defense to change the governing rules 'from time to time; and second, the rule that \"permits the admission of any evidence that would have 'probative value to a reasonable person. Alito asserts these rules cannot make the commissions illegitimate.\n\nOn the first rule Alito argued that not all changes during the course of a trial prejudice the defendant, and that some may even help the defendant. In addition, \"If a change is made and applied during the course of an ongoing proceeding and if the accused is found guilty, the validity of that procedure can be considered in the review proceeding for that case.\"\n\nOn the second rule, Alito argued that this rule does not violate the international standard incorporated into Common Article 3, because \"rules of evidence differ from country to country\" and \"much of the world does not follow aspects of our evidence rules, such as the general prohibition against the admission of hearsay\".\n\nThe impact of the decision on the petitioner (Hamdan) was that he can still be tried; however, his trial must be in a court, such as a military court-martial, or possibly a commission that has court-like protections.\n\nShortly thereafter, the Military Commissions Act of 2006 may have raised again the issue of which court would hear cases such as Hamdan's. The U.S. Department of Justice has filed notice with several federal judges, and given notice to hundreds of detainees, that the habeas petitions of alien unlawful enemy combatants (or those whose status is to be determined) are not within the jurisdiction of those courts.\n\nThe passage and signing of the Act follows through on President Bush's expressed intention to get explicit Congressional authorization to use military tribunals. Press Secretary Tony Snow echoed the plan to appeal to Congress.\n\nHowever, even among Senate Republicans, there were conflicting views. Senators Arlen Specter and Lindsey Graham (the latter a former military prosecutor) indicated Congress would work quickly to authorize tribunals, while influential Senator John Warner suggested a cautious and deliberative response. The potential for Congressional action also provided an avenue for politicking, as Republicans threatened Democratic members of Congress with being labeled weak on terrorism if they did not authorize tribunals.\n\nOn July 7, 2006, the Secretary of Defense issued a memo \"Application of Common Article 3 of the Geneva Conventions to the Treatment of Detainees in the Department of Defense\". This may be the basis of a July 11, 2006, statement by the Bush administration that all detainees at Guantanamo Bay and in U.S. military custody everywhere are entitled to humane treatment under the Geneva Conventions. This declaration appears not to cover CIA detainees and is ambiguous with respect to the interpretation of Common Article 3 and the definition of \"humane treatment\".\n\nThere were some indications that the other detainees being held at facilities throughout the world (e.g., Bagram Air Base and black sites), might use the Supreme Court's ruling to challenge their treatment. Their reasoning may be that since the Geneva Conventions afforded protection to Hamdan, its other protections might be effective for them as well. Commentators expressed mixed opinions about the strength of this argument.\n\nThe decision may have important implications for other disputes relating to the extent of executive power and the unitary executive theory. In particular, it may undermine the Bush administration's legal arguments for domestic wiretapping by the National Security Agency without warrants as required by the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act.\n\nOn June 5, 2007, Hamdan and Canadian youth Omar Khadr, had all charges against them dismissed. The judges presiding over their military commissions ruled that the Military Commissions Act did not give them the jurisdiction to try Hamdan and Khadr, because it only authorized the trial of \"unlawful enemy combatants\". Hamdan and Khadr's Combatant Status Review Tribunals, like those of all the other Guantanamo captives, had confirmed them as \"enemy combatants\".\n\nIn December 2007, a tribunal determined that Hamdan was an \"unlawful enemy combatant\". In August 2008, he was convicted by the military commission of the lesser of two charges and received a sentence of 66 months, reduced by time served to five and a half months. In November 2008, the US transferred him to Yemen, where he served his last month. After release, he joined his family in Sana. In October 2012, the US Appeals Court for the District of Columbia, overturned Hamdan's conviction, acquitting him of the charge.\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "155337", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=155337", "title": "Hyponymy and hypernymy", "text": "Hyponymy and hypernymy\n\nIn linguistics, a hyponym (from Greek \"hupó\", \"under\" and \"ónoma\", \"name\") is a word or phrase whose semantic field is included within that of another word, its hyperonym or hypernym (from Greek \"hupér\", \"over\" and \"ónoma\", \"name\"). In simpler terms, a hyponym is in a \"type-of\" relationship with its hypernym. For example, \"pigeon\", \"crow\", \"eagle\" and \"seagull\" are all hyponyms of \"bird\" (their hypernym); which, in turn, is a hyponym of \"animal\".\n\nHyponymy shows the relationship between a generic term (hypernym) and a specific instance of it (hyponym). A hyponym is a word or phrase whose semantic field is more specific than its hypernym. The semantic field of a hypernym, also known as a superordinate, is broader than that of a hyponym. An approach to the relationship between hyponyms and hypernyms is to view a hypernym as consisting of hyponyms. This, however, becomes more difficult with abstract words such as \"imagine\", \"understand\" and \"knowledge\". While hyponyms are typically used to refer to nouns, it can also be used on other parts of speech. Like nouns, hypernyms in verbs are words that refer to a broad category of actions. For example, verbs such as \"stare\", \"gaze\", \"view\" and \"peer\" can also be considered hyponyms of the verb \"look\", which is their hypernym.\n\nHypernyms and hyponyms are asymmetric. Hyponymy can be tested by substituting X and Y in the sentence ‘X is a kind of Y’ and determining if it makes sense. For example, ‘A screwdriver is a kind of tool’ makes sense but not ‘A tool is a kind of screwdriver’.\n\nStrictly speaking, the meaning relation between hyponyms and hypernyms applies to lexical items of the same word class (or parts of speech), and holds between senses rather than words. For instance, the word \"screwdriver\" used in the previous example refers to the tool for turning a screw, and not to the drink made with vodka and orange juice.\n\nHyponymy is a transitive relation, if X is a hyponym of Y, and Y is a hyponym of Z, then X is a hyponym of Z. For example, \"violet\" is a hyponym of \"purple\" and \"purple\" is a hyponym of \"color\"; therefore \"violet\" is a hyponym of \"color\". A word can be both a hypernym and a hyponym: for example \"purple\" is a hyponym of colour but itself is a hypernym of the broad spectrum of shades of purple between the range of \"crimson\" and \"violet\".\n\nThe hierarchical structure of semantic fields can be mostly seen in hyponymy. They could be observed from top to bottom, where the higher level is more general and the lower level is more specific. For example, \"living things\" will be the highest level followed by \"plants\" and \"animals\", and the lowest level may comprise \"dog\", \"cat\" and \"wolf\".\n\nUnder the relations of hyponymy and incompatibility, taxonomic hierarchical structures too can be formed. It consists of two relations; the first one being exemplified in 'An X is a Y' (simple hyponymy) while the second relation is 'An X is a kind/type of Y'. The second relation is said to be more discriminating and can be classified more specifically under the concept of taxonomy.\n\nIf the hypernym Z consists of hyponyms X and Y, X and Y are identified as co-hyponyms. Co-hyponyms are labelled as such when separate hyponyms share the same hypernym but are not hyponyms of one another, unless they happen to be synonymous. For example, \"screwdriver\", \"scissors\", \"knife\", and \"hammer\" are all co-hyponyms of one another and hyponyms of \"tool\", but not hyponyms of one another: *‘A hammer is a type of knife’ is false.\n\nCo-hyponyms are often but not always related to one another by the relation of incompatibility. For example, \"apple\", \"peach\" and \"plum\" are co-hyponyms of \"fruit\". However, an \"apple\" is not a \"peach\", which is also not a \"plum\". Thus, they are incompatible. Nevertheless, co-hyponyms are not necessarily incompatible in all senses. A \"queen\" and \"mother\" are both hyponyms of \"woman\" but there is nothing preventing the \"queen\" from being a \"mother\". This shows that compatibility may be relevant.\n\nComputer science often terms this relationship an \"is-a\" relationship. For example, the phrase 'Red is-a colour' can be used to describe the hyponymic relationship between \"red\" and \"colour\".\nHyponymy is the most frequently encoded relation among synsets used in lexical databases such as WordNet. These semantic relations can also be used to compare semantic similarity by judging the distance between two synsets and to analyse Anaphora.\n\nAs a hypernym can be understood as a more general word than its hyponym, the relation is used in semantic compression by generalization to reduce a level of specialization.\n\nThe notion of hyponymy is particularly relevant to language translation, as hyponyms are very common across languages. For example, in Japanese the word for older brother is , and the word for younger brother is . An English-to-Japanese translator presented with a phrase containing the English word \"brother\" would have to choose which Japanese word equivalent to use. This would be difficult, because abstract information (such as the speakers' relative ages) is often not available during machine translation.\n\n\n\n"}

He is the president and founder of Eurasia Group, a political risk research and consulting firm with offices in New York City, Washington, London, Tokyo, São Paulo, San Francisco, and Singapore. He is the author of several books, including \"The J Curve,\" \"Every Nation for Itself,\" and the New York Times bestselling \"Us vs. Them: The Failure of Globalism\". As of December 2014, he is foreign affairs columnist and editor-at-large at \"Time\". In 2013, he was named Professor at New York University. Eurasia Group provides analysis and expertise about how political developments and national security dynamics move markets and shape investment environments across the globe.\n\nBremmer is of Armenian and German descent. His father, Arthur, served in the Korean War and died at age of 46 when Bremmer was four. He grew up in housing projects in Chelsea, Massachusetts, near Boston. His mother raised him and his brother with little help and little money. Bremmer went to St. Dominic Savio High School in East Boston. He later earned a BA in International Relations, \"magna cum laude\", from Tulane University in 1989 and a PhD in Political Science from Stanford University in 1994, writing \"The politics of ethnicity: Russians in the Ukraine\".\n\nHe then served on the faculty of the Hoover Institution where, at 25, he became the Institution's youngest-ever National Fellow. In 1998, he founded the Eurasia Group and had Carter Page on its staff for three months. He has held research and faculty positions at New York University (where he currently teaches), Columbia University, the EastWest Institute, the World Policy Institute, Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory, and the Asia Society Policy Institute, where he has served as the first Harold J. Newman Distinguished Fellow in Geopolitics since 2015.\n\nBremmer is most widely known for advances in political risk; referred to as the \"guru\" in the field by \"The Economist\" and \"The Wall Street Journal\" and, more directly, bringing political science as a discipline to the financial markets. In 2001, Bremmer created Wall Street's first global political risk index, now the GPRI (Global Political Risk Index). Bremmer's definition of an emerging market as \"a country where politics matters at least as much as economics to the market\" is a standard reference in the political risk field.\n\nBremmer has published ten books, including the national bestsellers \"\" (Portfolio, May 2012), which details risks and opportunities in a world without global leadership, and \"\" (Portfolio, May 2010), which describes the global phenomenon of state capitalism and its implications for economics and politics. He also wrote \"\" (Simon & Schuster, 2006), selected by \"The Economist\" as one of the best books of 2006. His latest book is \"\" (Portfolio, April 2018), which provides an analysis of the global implications of rising populist nationalism and government responses.\n\nBremmer is a frequent writer and commentator in the media. He is the foreign affairs columnist and editor-at-large for \"Time\", a contributor for the \"Financial Times\" A-List, and has also published articles in \"The Washington Post\", \"The New York Times\", \"The Wall Street Journal\", \"Harvard Business Review\", \"Foreign Affairs\" and many other publications. He appears regularly on CNBC, CNN, Fox News Channel, Bloomberg Television, National Public Radio, the BBC, and other networks. He has been a regular guest and occasional host of Charlie Rose Show and has appeared frequently on \"Real Time with Bill Maher\".\n\nAmong his professional appointments, Bremmer serves on the President's Council of the Near East Foundation, the Leadership Council for the Concordia Summit, and the Board of Trustees of Intelligence Squared. In 2007, he was named as a 'Young Global Leader' of the World Economic Forum, and in 2010, founded and was appointed Chair of the Forum's Global Agenda Council for Geopolitical Risk. In December 2015, Bremmer was knighted by the government of Italy. In 2017, he became LinkedIn's most influential voice globally.\n\nHe lives in New York City.\n\nBremmer's research fields include: international political economy, geoeconomics and geopolitics, states in transition and global emerging markets, and US foreign policy.\n\nBremmer's outlines the link between a country's openness and its stability. While many countries are stable because they are open (the United States, France, Japan), others are stable because they are closed (North Korea, Cuba, Iraq under Saddam Hussein). States can travel both forward (right) and backwards (left) along this J curve, so stability and openness are never secure. The J is steeper on the left hand side, as it is easier for a leader in a failed state to create stability by closing the country than to build a civil society and establish accountable institutions; the curve is higher on the far right than left because states that prevail in opening their societies (Eastern Europe, for example) ultimately become more stable than authoritarian regimes.\n\nIan Bremmer describes state capitalism as a system in which the state dominates markets primarily for political gain. In his book, \"\" (New York: Portfolio, 2010), Bremmer describes China as the primary driver for the rise of state capitalism as a challenge to the free market economies of the developed world, particularly in the aftermath of the financial crisis.\n\nThe term G-Zero world refers to a breakdown in global leadership brought about by a decline of Western influence and the inability of other nations to fill the void. It is a reference to a perceived shift away from the pre-eminence of the [\"G7\"] (\"Group of Seven\") industrialized countries and the expanded Group of Twenty, which includes major emerging powers like China, India, Brazil, Turkey, and others. In his book, \"\" (New York: Portfolio, 2012), Bremmer explains that, in the G-Zero, no country or group of countries has the political and economic leverage to drive an international agenda or provide global public goods.\n\nThe term \"weaponization of finance\" refers to the foreign policy strategy of using incentives (access to capital markets) and penalties (varied types of sanctions) as tools of coercive diplomacy. In his Eurasia Group Top Risks 2015 report, Bremmer coins the term weaponization of finance to describe the ways in which the United States is using its influence to affect global outcomes. Rather than rely on traditional elements of America’s security advantage – including US-led alliances such as NATO and multi-lateral institutions such as the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund – Bremmer argues that the US is now ‘weaponizing finance’ by limiting access to the American marketplace and to US banks as an instrument of its foreign and security policy.\n\nBremmer uses 'pivot state' to describe a nation that is able to build profitable relationships with multiple other major powers without becoming overly reliant on any one of them. This ability to hedge allows a pivot state to avoid capture—in terms of security or economy—at the hands of a single country. In his book, \"Every Nation for Itself: Winners and Losers in a G-Zero World\" (New York: Portfolio, 2012), Bremmer explains how, in a volatile G-Zero world, the ability to pivot will take on increased importance. At the opposite end of the spectrum are shadow states that are frozen within the influence of a single power. The United States' neighbors illustrate the terms very well. With significant trade ties with both the United States and Asia and formal security ties with NATO, Canada is a good example of a pivot state that is hedged against a slowdown in or conflict with any single major power. Mexico, on the other hand, is a shadow state due to its overwhelming reliance on the US economy.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "4612245", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=4612245", "title": "Infamous Decade", "text": "Infamous Decade\n\nThe Infamous Decade (in Spanish, Década Infame) in Argentina is the name given to the period of time that began in 1930 with the coup d'état against President Hipólito Yrigoyen by José Félix Uriburu and resulted in the rising to power of Juan Perón after the Military coup of 1943. This decade was marked by significant rural exodus, many small rural landowners being ruined by the Great Depression, which in turn pushed the country towards import substitution industrialization. The poor economic results of the policy and popular discontent led to another coup in 1943, the \"Revolution of '43\", by the \"Grupo de Oficiales Unidos\" (GOU), the nationalist faction of the Armed Forces, against acting president Ramón Castillo, putting an end to the Infamous Decade.\n\nThis period was characterised by electoral fraud, persecution of the political opposition (mainly against the UCR) and generalised government corruption, against the background of the Great Depression. The impact of the economic crisis forced many farmers and other countryside workers to relocate to the outskirts of the larger cities, resulting in the creation of the first \"villas miseria\" (shanty towns). Thus, the population of Buenos Aires jumped from 1.5 million inhabitants in 1914 to 3.5 million in 1935. Lacking in political experience, in contrast with the European immigrants who brought with them socialist and anarchist ideas, these new city-dwellers would provide the social base, in the next decade, for Peronism.\n\nThe democratic liberal senator Lisandro de la Torre (founder in 1914 of the Democratic Progressive Party) denounced various scandals, directing an investigation on the meat trade starting in 1935. In the midst of the investigation, de la Torre's disciple, senator-elect Enzo Bordabehere, was murdered by Ramón Valdez Cora on the Senate floor, and the province of Santa Fe was intervened. The murder was depicted by Juan José Jusid's 1984 film, \"Asesinato en el Senado de la Nación\".\n\nCHADE (\"Companía Hispano Argentina de Electricidad\", an offshoot of the Sofina multinational conglomerate) was also at the heart of an important political and financial scandal. The CHADE scandal, symbol of the Infamous Decade, led to investigations following the revolution of 1943 that deposed Ramón Castillo's government in a military coup, and to the subsequent Rodríguez Conde report on concessions given to the electrical companies.\n\nIn 1931, a year after the execution of the Italian anarchist Severino Di Giovanni and his comrade Paulino Scarfó--who had implemented a propaganda of the deed campaign aimed both at international support of the Sacco and Vanzetti case and at attacking Fascist Italy's interests in Argentina--three anarchists were given life sentences during a show trial in which they were tortured, on the charges of having assassinated family members of conservative politician José M. Blanch. Known as the \"prisoners of Bragado\" (\"presos de Bragado\"), the case raised international public indignation. Anarchists, who had created a solidarity network with comrades expelled under the 1902 Law on Residency which legalised the expulsion of immigrants who \"compromise national security or disturb public order\", were considered as public enemies by Uriburu's dictatorship. Prior to their execution, three anarchist bombs had detonated at three strategic places on the Buenos Aires railway network on 20 January 1931, killing three and wounding 17.\n\nIn 1942 Minister Solano Lima signed the prisoners' releases; their names were cleared by a 1993 law upheld by Socialist deputy Guillermo Estévez Boero. In 2003 a law granted a pension to the daughter of one of the anarchist victims of this show trial.\n\nIn 1933 Arturo Jauretche took part in a failed uprising, led by Col. Francisco Bosch and Col. Gregorio Pomar in Paso de los Libres, in the province of Corrientes. He was subsequently detained.\n\nIt was during Justo's term that Argentina signed the Roca-Runciman Treaty with the United Kingdom, which assured the UK a provision of fresh meat in exchange for important investments in the field of transportation in Argentina, given certain economic concessions from Argentina, such as giving control over the public transport in Buenos Aires to a British company, the \"Corporación de Transportes\".\n\nAt the 1932 Ottawa Conference, the British had adopted measures that favored imports from its own colonies and dominions. The pressure from Argentine landowners for whom the government restored trade with the main buyer of Argentine grain and meat had been very strong. Led by the president of the British Trade Council, Viscount Walter Runciman, they were intense and resulted in the signing on April 27 of the Roca-Runciman Treaty.\n\nThe treaty created a scandal, because the UK allotted Argentina a quota less than any of its dominions--390,000 tons of meat per year were allotted to Argentina in exchange for many concessions to British companies, and 85% of exportation had to be arranged through British refrigerated shippers. In addition, the tariffs of the railways operated by the UK were not regulated, the treaty did not establish customs fees over coal, had given special dispensation to British companies with investments in Argentina and had reduced the prices of their exports. So many problems resulted from the treaty that Vice President Roca, after the signing of the treaty, declared, \"By its economic importance, Argentina resembles just a large British dominion.\" Lisandro de la Torre, one of Roca's principal and most vociferous opponents, mocking his words in an editorial, wrote, \"In these conditions we wouldn't be able to say that Argentina had been converted into a British dominion because England does not take the liberty to impose similar humiliations upon its dominions.\" \n\nThe National Democratic Party, one of the parties that had supported the nomination of Justo for President, had split because of this controversy. Finally the Senate rescinded the treaty on July 28. Many workers strikes followed the deliberations, especially in Santa Fé Province, which ended with government intervention.\n\nOn the other hand, the trade isolationism of the world powers ultimately prompted the beginning of Argentine industrial development via import substitution. Important firms, such as the Bunge & Born agribusiness food company and the Tornquist group, previously turned towards exports but began to diversify their activities and invest in national industries aimed at local consumption.\n\nUnder the direction of conservative Minister of Economy Federico Pinedo, economic policy became interventionist, although still in a conservative aim. Pinedo created the Central Bank (BCRA), which was advised by Sir Otto Niemeyer, the director of the Bank of England. The BCRA's board of director was mainly composed of personalities tied to private banks. It had as its missions the managing of the peso and the regulation of interest rates. Writer and thinker Raúl Scalabrini Ortiz was a strong critic of British involvement in Argentina, of which the BCRA itself was the prime example.\n\nThe \"Juntas Reguladores Nacionales\" were also created during this period, aimed at developing private and state activities and controlling the quality of products, both for national consumption and for export. In order to support prices of products and avoid overproduction, the Juntas destroyed entire loads of corn, used as fuel for locomotives, despite popular hunger. Thirty million pesos per year were spent to destroy wine products.\n\nFurthermore, Pinedo launched a national project of road construction, the national network reaching 30,000 kilometers in 1938 (although many remained without pavement). This competed with the railway system, in the hands of mostly British companies, and furthered the penetration of US firms selling motor vehicles, in the Argentine market. US foreign direct investment (FDI) grew during this time, with companies such as the textile firms Sudamtex, Ducilo and Anderson Clayton establishing themselves in Argentina, as well as the tire companies Firestone and Goodyear, the electronics firm Philco and the chemistry firm Johnson & Johnson.\n\nNotable exceptions to these conservative policies were the policies of Luciano Molinas, governor of the Santa Fe Province (1932–1936) and one of the leader of the Democratic Progressive Party, and of Amadeo Sabattini, Governor of Córdoba (1936–1940). The first act of governor Molinas, assuming office on February 20, 1932, was to re-establish the progressive Constitution of the Santa Fe Province established by the Constituent Assembly of 1921, which had been abrogated by the radical governor Enrique Mosca. He also ensured independence of the judicial system, tax equality, secular education, women's suffrage and right of foreigners' to vote for the election of communal authorities. Molinas' administration also created the Provincial Department of Labour, which ensured the observance of article 28 of the provincial Constitution, concerning the 8 hours day, minimum wages and regulation of child and female labour. Molinas also reduced his salary from 2,500 to 1,800 pesos, suspended payment of the external debt of the province, which permitted Santa Fe's budget to become positive. Henceforth, he subsidized public works under the impulsion of the minister Alberto Casella, leading to increased local employment. He also implemented moderate land reforms, harshly opposed by the conservative and Alvearist radicals, as well as the \"Sociedad Rural\". Finally, he created the Experimental Institute of Agricultural Investigation, a predecessor of the National Agricultural Technology Institute (INTA).\n\nHowever, fearing electoral defeats for the \"Concordancia\" both in Santa Fe and in the Electoral College, Justo ordered military intervention in the Santa Fe Province on October 3, 1935, sending the Colonel Perlinger and the minister Joaquín F. Rodríguez to take control of the local government. Armed resistance against the federal intervention occurred, but in order to avoid a bloodbath, Molinas and De la Torre rejected the resistance. Rodríguez soon abrogated again the 1921 Constitution and progressively dismantled Molinas' achievements.\n\nJusto had already ordered intervention in the Provinces of San Juan and Tucumán in 1934, and ordered similar military interventions in Catamarca, Santa Fe and Buenos Aires in 1935 (the latter enabling the fraudulent election of Manuel Fresco as governor ). Despite this federal intervention, Marcelo Alvear's Radical party (UCR) decided in 1935 to abandon its abstentionist policy protesting the fraud. Opposed to Alvear's turnaround, in 1935, young Yrigoyenistas from a nationalist background founded FORJA (\"Fuerza Orientadora Radical de la Juventud Argentina\", Radical Orienting Force of Argentine Youth), which had as leaders the Socialist Arturo Jauretche, Raúl Scalabrini Ortiz and Gabriel del Mazo. FORJA's motto was: \"We are a colonial Argentina, we want to be a free Argentina.\" Among other things, FORJA denounced the silence of the government on many problems such as the creation of the Central Bank, \"economic sacrifices imposed in benefices of foreign capitalism\", \"petroleum politics\", \"arbitrary military interventions\", \"restrictions to freedom of opinion\", \"incorporation to the League of Nations\", \"suppression of relations with Russia\", \"parliamentary investigations\", \"the Senate crime\", etc.\n\nAt the time of the 1930 coup, three trade unions existed in Argentina: the \"Confederación Obrera Argentina\" (COA, founded in 1926 and linked to the Socialist Party), the \"Unión Sindical Argentina\" (USA, anarcho-syndicalist) and the FORA V (dissolved by Uriburu). On September 20, 1930, the COA and the USA merged in the General Confederation of Labour (CGT), although the two rival tendencies remained.\n\nMeanwhile, the syndicalist current of the CGT was discredited, because of its supporting alliance with the government in order to achieve social advances, while the socialist current proposed open opposition, tied to political support to the Socialist party. The syndicalist current was in particular affected by its agreements with the pro-fascist governor of Buenos Aires, Manuel Fresco (1936–1940). The latter, who had been elected during one of the \"most burlesque\" and \"fraudulent\" elections of the Infamous Decade (according to the words of the US embassador ), commissioned the architect Francisco Salamone various buildings, which combined Art Deco, functionalism, Futurism and Fascist architectures.\n\nAlthough the Great Depression and the subsequent rural exodus had brought many politically inexperienced workers to Buenos Aires, the spontaneous import substitution industrialization enabled, starting in 1935, coupled to the strengthening of trade unions, wages' increase. Henceforth, a 48-hour general strike was launched in January 1936 by workers' in construction, during which 3 workers and 3 policemen were killed.\n\nRoberto Marcelino Ortiz and Ramón S. Castillo's candidacies, respectively as president and vice-president, for the 1938 elections were launched at the British Chamber of Commerce, and supported by its president William Mc Callum. Ortiz, a former Alvearista, was fraudulently elected, and assumed his new office in February 1938. However, without much success, he attempted to clean up the country's corruption, ordering federal intervention in the Province of Buenos Aires, governed by Manuel Fresco, and cancelling the fraudulent elections which had been won by the conservative Alberto Barceló.\n\nFederico Pinedo, still Minister of Economy, presented on 18 November 1940 an \"Economic Reactivation Plan\", which was to implement some protectionist measures and building of social lodging in order to face the crisis. He also proposed the nationalization of the British railways, having agreed upon advantageous terms for their owners with them beforehand. However, the conservatives voted against his plan, which led him to resign.\n\nDuring World War II, Argentina maintained the same neutrality it had adopted during the first World War, which was advantageous for Great Britain. Although the USA attempted to push the country into the war, during the January 1942 Rio de Janeiro Conference, Argentina resisted, with support from the British. A few months later, in June 1942, Ortiz resigned because of his sickness, and died a month later.\n\nHe was replaced by his vice-president Castillo, who began to work to launch the candidacy of Robustiano Patrón Costas, vice-president of the Senate and sugar entrepreneur, who had supported him in 1938. Meanwhile, the Democratic Union political coalition (which included the Radical Civic Union, the Democratic Progressive Party, as well as the Socialist Party and the Communist Party) had been formed in 1942. Their electoral platform, aimed against endemic corruption, announced the needs to guarantee \"freedom of thought and assembly\" and \"labor union rights\", as well as vouching for \"active solidarity with the people struggling against the Nazi-Fascist aggression\".\n\nOn 4 June 1943, the nationalist faction of the army, gathered around the \"Grupo de Oficiales Unidos\" (GOU, formed in March 1943) opposed both to corruption and to the Left, overthrew Castillo in a coup. Composed under the initiative of the colonel Miguel A. Montes and Urbano de la Vega, the GOU included as main members the colonel Juan Domingo Perón and Enrique P. González. Sympathisers of Nazi Germany and Fascist Italy, the GOU established General Pedro Ramírez as chief of state, despite a short attempt by General Arturo Rawson to claim the office.\n\n\nThe 10-year-long presidency of Carlos Menem (two consecutive periods, 1989–1999) has been referred to as the \"second\" (or \"new\") Infamous Decade by strong critics of its neoliberalist policies and its perceived corruption, especially from the left wing. The period 1999–2001 under Fernando de la Rúa is sometimes included, as a continuation of those policies.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "36092415", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=36092415", "title": "Lebanese Resistance Regiments", "text": "Lebanese Resistance Regiments\n\nThe Lebanese Resistance Regiments ( | \"Afwaj al-Muqawama al-Lubnaniyya\", AMAL), also designated Lebanese Resistance Battalions, Lebanese Resistance Detachments, Lebanese Resistance Legions and Battalions de la Resistance Libanaise (BRL) or Légions de la Resistance Libanaise (LRL) in French, but simply known by its Arabic acronym Amal which means \"Hope\", were the military wing of the Movement of the Dispossessed or Movement of the Deprived, a political organization representing the Muslim Shia community of Lebanon. The movement's political wing was officially founded in February 1973 from a previous organization bearing the same name and its military wing was formed in January 1975. The Amal militia was a major player in the Lebanese Civil War from 1975 to 1991. The militia has now been disarmed, though the movement itself, now known as the Amal Movement (Arabic: \"Harakat Amal\"), is a notable Shia political party in Lebanon.\n\nThe Amal militia was founded in 1975 as the militant wing of the Movement of the Disinherited, a Shi'a political movement founded by Musa al-Sadr and Hussein el-Husseini a year earlier. It became one of the most important Shi'a Muslim militias during the Lebanese Civil War. Amal grew strong with the support of, and through its ties with, Syria and the 300,000 Shi'a internal refugees from southern Lebanon after the Israeli bombings in the early 1980s. Amal's practical objectives were to gain greater respect for Lebanon's Shi'ite population and the allocation of a larger share of governmental resources for the Shi'ite-dominated southern part of the country.\n\nAt its zenith, the militia had 14,000 troops. Amal fought a long campaign against Palestinian refugees during the Lebanese Civil War (called the War of the Camps). After the War of the Camps, Amal fought a bloody battle against rival Shi'a group Hezbollah for control of Beirut, which provoked Syrian military intervention. Hezbollah itself was formed by religious members of Amal who had left after Nabih Berri's assumption of full control and the subsequent resignation of most of Amal's earliest senior members.\n\nHarakat al-Mahrumin (حركة المحرومين | The Movement of the Dispossessed) was established by Imam Musa al-Sadr and member of parliament Hussein el-Husseini in 1974.\nOn January 20, 1975 the Lebanese Resistance Detachments (also referred to in English as 'Battalions of the Lebanese Resistance') is formed as the military wing of the Movement of the Disinherited under the leadership of al-Sadr. In 1978 the founder al-Sadr disappears in mysterious circumstances while visiting Libya and was succeeded by Hussein el-Husseini as leader of Amal.\n\nIn 1979 Palestinian guerrillas attempt to assassinate then-Secretary General Hussein el-Husseini by launching missiles into his home, outside Beirut.\n\nIn 1980 Hussein el-Husseini resigned from Amal leadership after refusing to \"drench Amal in blood\" and fight alongside the PLO or any other faction.\n\nIn 1980 Nabih Berri became one of the leaders of Amal, marking the entry of Amal in the Lebanese Civil War.\n\nIn summer 1982 Husayn Al-Musawi, deputy head and official spokesman of Amal, broke away to form the Islamist Islamic Amal Movement. In May 1985, heavy fighting erupted between Amal and Palestinian camp militias for the control of the Sabra, Shatila and Burj el-Barajneh camps in Beirut, sparking the so-called \"War of the Camps\" which lasted until 1987.\n\nIn December 1985 Nabih Berri of Amal, Walid Jumblatt of the Druze Progressive Socialist Party, and Elie Hobeika of the Lebanese Forces signed the Tripartite Accord in Damascus which was supposed to give strong influence to Damascus regarding Lebanese matters. The agreement never came into effect due to Hobeika's ousting.\n\nHeavy fighting erupted between Hezbollah and Amal in the wake of the \"War of Camps\" to which Hezbollah was opposed to. Syrian forces entered the area to help Amal against Hezbollah, Syrian troops killed dozens of Hezbollah members in which they claimed the members attacked them while Hezbollah claimed they were killed in cold blood. Fighting between the two factions lasted until 1989.\n\nOn February 22, 1987, Amal and the Druze PLA again turned against each other in what became known as the \"War of the Flag\". The conflict was sparked by an incident early that day, when a PLA fighter walked to the Channel 7 TV station (French: \"Télé Liban – Canal 7\") building in the Tallet el-Khayyat quarter and replaced the Lebanese national flag hoisted there by the PSP flag, which was interpreted by Amal militiamen as a deliberate act of provocation. A new round of brutal fighting soon spread throughout western Beirut, and although Amal forces initially managed to restore the Lebanese national flag on the Channel 7 building, they were subsequently overpowered by an alliance of PLA, LCP/Popular Guard and SSNP militias, who quickly seized large portions of West Beirut. Eventually, the fighting was curbed by the massive deployment at West Beirut of Syrian troops under the command of Major-General Ghazi Kanaan, assisted by Lebanese Internal Security Forces (ISF) gendarmes.\n\nOn February 17, 1988 the American Chief of the United Nations Truce Supervision Organization (UNTSO) observer mission in Lebanon, Lt. Col. William R. Higgins, was abducted and later killed after meeting with Amal's political leader of southern Lebanon. Amal responded by launching a campaign against Hezbollah in the south, It was believed that Hezbollah abducted him; Though the party to this day denies it and insists that it was done to create problems between them and the Amal movement. In April 1988 Amal launched an all-out assault on Hezbollah positions in south Lebanon and the southern suburbs of Beirut. Early in May 1988 Hezbollah gained control of 80% of the Shi'ite suburbs of Beirut through well-timed assaults.\n\nIn 1989 Amal accepted the Taif agreement (mainly authored by el-Husseini) in order to end the civil war.\n\nIn September 1991, with background in the Syrian controlled end of the Lebanese Civil War in October 1990, 2,800 Amal troops joined the Lebanese army.\n\nThe origins of the Amal movement lie with the Lebanese cleric of Iranian origin Imam Musa al-Sadr. In 1974, the Harakat al-Mahrumin (Movement of the Deprived) was established by al-Sadr and member of parliament Hussein el-Husseini to attempt to reform the Lebanese system. While acknowledging its support base to be the \"traditionally under-represented politically and economically disadvantaged\" Shi'a community, it aimed, according to Palmer-Harik, to seek social justice for all deprived Lebanese. Although influenced by Islamic ideas, it was a secular movement trying to unite people along communal rather than religious or ideological lines. The Greek-Catholic Archbishop of Beirut, Mgr. Grégoire Haddad, was among the founders of the Movement.\n\nOn January 20, 1975, the Lebanese Resistance Detachments (also referred to in English as 'The Battalions of the Lebanese Resistance') were formed as a military wing of The Movement of the Disinherited under the leadership of al-Sadr, and came to be popularly known as Amal (from the acronym \"Afwaj al-Mouqawma Al-Lubnaniyya\"). In 1978, al-Sadr disappeared in mysterious circumstances while visiting Libya, the Amal movement's regional supporter at the time. There are credible allegations that Yasser Arafat asked Gaddafi to \"disappear\" al-Sadr. Hussein el-Husseini became leader of Amal and was followed by Nabih Berri in April 1980 after el-Husseini resigned. One of the consequences of the rise of Berri, a less educated leader, the increasing secular yet sectarian nature of the movement and move away from an Islamic context for the movement was a splintering of the movement.\n\nThe movement's militia was secretly established on 20 January 1975 with the help of the Palestinian Fatah, who provided weapons and training at their Beqaa facilities. The formation of Amal was revealed in July that year when an accidental explosion of a landmine at one of the Fatahland camps near Baalbek killed over 60 Shia trainees, which caused considerable embarrassment to Fatah and forced Al-Sadr to admit publicly the militia's existence. When the civil war finally broke out in April 1975, Amal's strength stood at about 1,500–3,000 armed militants, backed by a motor force of gun-trucks (a.k.a. technicals) fitted with heavy machine guns, recoilless rifles and anti-aircraft autocannons.\n\nBy the mid-1980s however, the movement totaled 14,000–16,000 militiamen trained and armed by Syria, of which 3,000–6,000 were full-time uniformed regulars and the remaining 10,000 part-time male and female irregulars. Amal's regular forces were bolstered by 6,000 ex-Lebanese Army soldiers from the Sixth Brigade, a predominantly Shia Muslim formation that went over to their co-religionists following the collapse of the government forces in February 1984. Commanded by the Shi'ite Major-General Abd al-Halim Kanj, and headquartered at the Henri Chihab Barracks at Jnah in the south-western Chyah suburb of West Beirut, this formation was subsequently enlarged by absorbing Shia deserters from other Army units, which included the 97th Battalion from the Seventh Brigade. Outside the Lebanese Capital, Amal militia forces operating in Baalbek and Hermel received support from certain elements of the mainly Shi'ite First Brigade stationed in the Beqaa Valley.\n\nMost of Amal's own weapons and equipment were provided by the PLO, Libya, Iran and Syria or pilfered from Lebanese Armed Forces (LAF) and Internal Security Forces (ISF) reserves after their collapse in January 1976. Additional weaponry, vehicles and other, non-lethal military equipments were procured in the international black market.\n\nAmal militiamen were provided with a variety of small-arms, including MAT-49 submachine guns, M1 Garand (or its Italian-produced copy, the Beretta Model 1952) and SKS semi-automatic rifles, AMD-65 assault carbines, CETME Model C, Heckler & Koch G3, FN FAL, M16A1, AK-47 and AKM assault rifles (other variants included the Zastava M70, Chinese Type 56, Romanian AIM, Bulgarian AKK/AKKS and former East German MPi assault rifles). Several models of handguns were also used, including Tokarev TT-33, CZ 75, FN P35 and MAB PA-15 pistols. Squad weapons consisted of Heckler & Koch HK21, RPK, RPD, PK/PKM, Rheinmetall MG 3, FN MAG and M60 light machine guns, with heavier Browning M1919A4 .30 Cal, Browning M2HB .50 Cal and DShK machine guns being employed as platoon and company weapons. Grenade launchers and portable anti-tank weapons consisted of M79 grenade launchers, M72 LAW and RPG-7 rocket launchers, whilst crew-served and indirect fire weapons included M2 60mm light mortars and 120-PM-43 (M-1943) 120mm heavy mortars, plus Type 56 75mm, B-10 82mm and M40A1 106mm recoilless rifles (often mounted on technicals). Soviet PTRS-41 14.5mm anti-tank rifles were used for heavy sniping.\n\nAmal's technicals' fleet consisted mostly of M151A2 jeeps, Land Rover II-III, Toyota Land Cruiser (J40), Jeep Gladiator J20, GMC Sierra Custom K25/K30, Chevrolet C-10 Cheyenne, Chevrolet C-20 Scottsdale and Chevrolet C/K 3rd generation light pickups, and Chevrolet Series 50 light-duty, Dodge F600 medium-duty and GMC C7500 heavy-duty trucks, partially supplanted in the 1980s by Volvo Laplander L3314A light utility vehicles, Dodge Ram (1st generation) pickups, , Nissan Patrol 160-Series pickups, and M35A1 and M35A2 2½-ton 6x6 cargo trucks. \nThe Sixth Brigade aligned an armoured battalion fielding Alvis Saladin and Panhard AML-90 armoured cars, AMX-13 light tanks, M48A5 main battle tanks, and three to four mechanized infantry battalions on M113, Alvis Saracen and VAB (4x4) armored personnel carriers. The collapse of the Fourth Brigade in February 1984 also allowed Amal to seize an additional number of AMX-13 light tanks and AMX-VCI and M113 APCs.\n\nIn addition, the well-equipped Beirut-based Amal forces also operated 30 or 50 Syrian-loaned T-55A MBTs, and three ex-PLO ZSU-23-4M Shilka SPAAG tracked vehicles seized from the Al-Mourabitoun in April 1985, whereas their guerrilla units fighting in the south of the country were able to add a few M113 Zelda and M3/M9 Zahlam half-tracks captured from the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) and their South Lebanon Army (SLA) proxies.\n\nAmal also fielded a powerful artillery corps equipped with Syrian-loaned Soviet 130 mm towed field gun M1954 (M-46) and 122 mm howitzer 2A18 (D-30) pieces, towed Type 63 107mm and truck-mounted BM-13 122mm multiple rocket launchers, whilst the Sixth Brigade aligned an artillery battalion equipped with US M114 155 mm howitzers. Soviet ZPU (ZPU-1, ZPU-2, ZPU-4) 14.5mm and ZU-23-2 23mm Anti-Aircraft autocannons (mounted on technicals, M35A1/A2 trucks and M113 APCs) were employed in both air defense and direct fire supporting roles.\n\nAmal's main sphere of influence encompassed the Shia-populated slum districts located at south-western Beirut of Chyah, Bir Abed, Bir Hassan, Ouza'i, and Khalde, with the latter including the adjoining International Airport, which they brought under their control in late February 1984. Outside the Capital, they also operated at Baalbek and Hermel in the Beqaa, and in the southern Jabal Amel region, notably around the port cities of Tyre and Sidon, and in the Iqlim al-Tuffah region down to the UNIFIL zone.\n\nIn addition to Syrian backing, Amal received some financial support from Libya and Iran – first by the Shah in 1975-78, replaced after 1979 by the new Islamic regime – and from the Lebanese Shi'ite immigrant community in West Africa. Additional revenues came from protection rackets (Arabic: \"Khuwa\") imposed on Shia neighborhoods and from tolls levied in illegal ports such as Ouza'i in Beirut, along with Zahrani, whose harbour and the adjacent Tapline oil refinery were employed in the contraband of fuel, and Sarafand (used for smuggling imported cars and other goods), both located south of Sidon.\n\nThe Movement had its own civil administration and assistance networks, gathered since the mid-1980s under the authority of the so-called 'Council of the South' (Arabic: \"Majliss al-Janoub\"). Headed by Amal's vice-president Muhammad Baydoun and based at the Christian town of Maghdouché near Sidon, it was responsible for running schools, hospitals, and conducting public works on Shia areas. Amal also run from its headquarters at Rue Hamra, in association with Zahir Al-Khatib's Toilers League a joint television service (Arabic: \"Al-Machriq\").\n\nIn the summer of 1982, Husayn Al-Musawi, deputy head and official spokesman of Amal, broke with Berri over his willingness to go along with U.S. mediation in Lebanon rather than attack Israeli troops, his membership in the National Salvation Council alongside the Christians, and his opposition to pledging allegiance to Ayatollah Khomeini.\n\nMusawi formed the Islamist Islamic Amal Movement, based in Baalbeck. It was aided by the Islamic Republic of Iran which, in the wake of the 1979 Islamic Revolution, strove not only to help Lebanon's Shi'a, but to export the PanIslamic revolution to the rest of the Muslim world, something Musawi strongly supported, saying, \"We are her (the Islamic Republic's) children.\"\n\nWe are seeking to formulate an Islamic society which in the final analysis will produce an Islamic state. ... The Islamic revolution will march to liberate Palestine and Jerusalem, and the Islamic state will then spread its authority over the region of which Lebanon is only a part.\n\nAbout 1,500 members of Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guard or Pasdaran, arrived at the Beqaa Valley at the time and \"directly contributed to ensure the survival and growth of al-Musawi's newly-created small militia,\" providing training, indoctrination and funding. Iran was in many ways a natural ally of Shia in Lebanon as it was far larger than Lebanon, oil-rich, and both Shi'a-majority and Shi'a-ruled. And of course, founder Musa al-Sadr had come from Iran. Iran's generous funding meant generous pay for the militias recruits—$150–200 per month plus cost-free education and medical treatment for themselves and their families—that \"far exceeded what other [Lebanese] militias were able to offer.\" This was a major incentive among the impoverished Shi'a community, and induced \"a sizable number of Amal fighters [to] defected regularly to the ranks\" of Islamic Amal, and later Hizb'Allah.\n\nBy August 1983, Islamic Amal and Hezbollah were \"effectively becoming one under the Hezbollah label,\" and by late 1984, Islamic Amal, along with \"all the known major groups\" in Lebanon, had been absorbed into Hezbollah.\n\nIn March–April 1985, Amal militia forces joined in a Syrian-backed coalition with the Popular Nasserist Organization (PNO), the Al-Mourabitoun and the Druze Progressive Socialist Party (PSP) militias, which defeated the Christian Lebanese Forces (LF) attempts to establish bridgeheads at Damour and Sidon.\n\nThe War of the Camps was a series of battles in the mid-1980s between Amal and Palestinian groups. The Druze-oriented Progressive Socialist Party (PSP) and Hezbollah supported the Palestinians while Syria backed Amal.\n\nAlthough most of the Palestinian guerrillas were expelled during the 1982 Israeli invasion, Palestinian militias began to regain their footing after the Israeli withdrawal firstly from Beirut, then Sidon and Tyre. Syria viewed this revival with some anxiety: though in the same ideological camp, Damascus had little control over most Palestinians organizations and was afraid that the build-up of Palestinian forces could lead to a new Israeli invasion. Moreover, Syria's minority Alawite regime was never comfortable with the Sunni militias in Lebanon, traditionally aligned with Egypt and Iraq. In Lebanon, Shia-Palestinian relations had been very tense since the late 1960s. After the multinational force withdrew from Beirut in February 1984, Amal and the PSP took control of west Beirut and Amal built a number of outposts around the camps (in Beirut but also in the south). On April 15, 1985, Amal and the PSP attacked the Al-Mourabitoun, the main Lebanese Sunni militia and the closest ally of the PLO in Lebanon. The Al-Mourabitoun forces were vanquished after a week of heavy fighting and their leader, Ibrahim Kulaylat was sent into exile. On May 19, 1985, heavy fighting erupted between Amal and the Palestinians for the control of the Sabra, Shatila and Burj el-Barajneh camps (all in Beirut). Despite its efforts, Amal could not take the control of the camps. The death toll remains unknown, with estimates ranging from a few hundreds to a few thousands. This and heavy political pressure from the Arab League led to a cease-fire on June 17.\n\nThe situation remained tense and fights occurred again in September 1985 and March 1986. On May 19, 1986, heavy fighting erupted again. Despite new armaments provided by Syria, Amal could not take control of the camps. Many cease-fires were announced, but most of them did not last more than a few days. The situation began to cool after Syria deployed some troops on June 24, 1986.\n\nThere was tension in the south, an area where Shi'as and Palestinians were both present. This unavoidably led to frequent clashes. On September 29, 1986, fighting erupted at the Rashidiyye refugee camp near Tyre. The conflict immediately spread to Sidon and Beirut. Palestinian forces managed to occupy the Amal-controlled town of Maghdouché on the eastern hills of Sidon to open the road to Rashidiyye. Syrian forces helped Amal and Israel launched air strikes against PLO position around Maghdouche. A cease-fire was negotiated between Amal and pro-Syrian Palestinian groups on December 15, 1986, but it was rejected by Yasser Arafat's Fatah. Fatah tried to appease the situation by giving some of its positions to Hezbollah and to the Al-Mourabitoun. The situation became relatively calm for a while, but the bombing against the camps continued. In Beirut, a blockade of the camps led to a dramatic shortage of food and medications inside the camps. In early 1987, the fighting spread to Hezbollah and the PSP who supported the Palestinians. The PSP, having won numerous battles, quickly seized large portions of west Beirut. Consequently, Syria occupied west Beirut beginning February 21, 1987. On April 7, 1987, Amal finally lifted the siege and handed its positions around the camps to the Syrian army. According to the \"New York Times\" (March 10, 1992, citing figures from the Lebanese police), 3,781 were killed in the fighting.\n\nOn February 17, 1988, Lt. Col William R. Higgins, American Chief of the UNTSO observer group in Lebanon, was abducted from his UN vehicle between Tyre and Nakara after a meeting with Abd al-Majid Salah, Amal's political leader in southern Lebanon. It soon became \"clear that Sheikh al-Musawi, the commander to Hezbollah's Islamic Resistance, had been personally responsible for the abduction of Lt. Col Higgins in close cooperation with both Sheikh Abdul Karim Obeid, the local commander of Hizballah's military wing, and Mustafa al-Dirani, the former head of Amal's security service.\" This is seen as a direct challenge to Amal by Hezbollah, and Amal responds by launching an offensive against Hezbollah in the south where it \"scores decisive military victories ... leading to the expulsion of a number of Hizballah clergy to the Beqqa\". In Beirut's southern suburbs however, where fighting also raged, Hizballah was much more successful. \"[E]lements within Hizballah and the Iranian Pasdaran established a joint command to assassinate high-ranking Amal officials and carry out operations against Amal checkpoints and centers.\"\n\nBy May, Amal had suffered major losses, its members were defecting to Hezbollah, and by June, Syria had to intervene militarily to rescue Amal from defeat. In January 1989, a truce in the \"ferocious\" fighting between Hizballah and Amal was arranged by Syrian and Iranian intervention. \"Under this agreement, Amal's authority over the security of southern Lebanon [is] recognized while Hizballah [is] permitted to maintain only a nonmilitary presence through political, cultural, and informational programmes.\"\n\nUpon the end of the war in October 1990, Amal militia forces operating in the Capital and the Beqaa were ordered in March 1991 to disband and surrender their heavy weaponry, a decision that came a few months after the Movement's leadership had already announced the dissolution of its own military force. The Sixth Brigade was re-integrated into the structure of the Lebanese Armed Forces (LAF) whilst an additional 2,800 ex-Amal militiamen joined the re-formed Lebanese Army in September of the following year. Despite the order to disarm, Amal guerrilla units in the south remained in place until the final Israeli pull-out in May 2000. One of their last significant operations was the Ansariya Ambush on September 15, 1997, where Amal commandos under Hezbollah command successfully ambushed an Israeli Shayetet 13 naval commando force.\n\n\n\n"}

It quickly became established as a bridging organisation between sex workers on the street and the provision of medical, social and administrative services. Its Paris headquarters is open daily to the population it serves. In addition it has eight permanent mobile units (buses) operating day and night in the areas frequented by sex workers in the capital, staffed by organisational and health professionals.\n\nThe principal mission of the association, whose administration consists of both sex workers and non-sex workers, is to work with and for sex workers to prevent HIV, hepatitis and sexually transmitted diseases. They distribute condoms and encourage sex workers to visit the office to get help with administrative, medical, and social needs, and conducts job searches for those who decide to transition out of sex work. Emphasis is placed on helping workers access their health, social and human rights. The objective is to enable workers to develop an environment that supports an active role for them in stating their needs and demands. In working with and for sex workers, the association fights against discrimination, social exclusion and human trafficking.\n\nThe association opposes abolitionism and its objective to eradicate sex work, and recognizes that some women have freely chosen to engage in sex work and that that choice must be respected. The association deals with both voluntary and involuntary sex workers, such as those trafficked from Eastern Europe, Africa and Asia.\n\nCurrently the association has fourteen employees including doctors and nurses, facilitators and an employment counsellor. It is funded from government grants which are allocated by agencies such as DDASS Paris (Direction départementale des Affaires sanitaires et sociales), the Paris conseil général, the CPAM de Paris (Caisse primaire d'assurance maladie) and the Conseil régional. The project also receives funding from the European Commission's Daphne Funding Programme.\n\nThe association has been politically active, for instance opposing the Sarkozy laws on solicitation. Claude Boucher appeared for them before the senate hearings.\n\n\n"}

He was referred to as the \"Master Spirit\" of the insurrection, and was only passed over as overall leader in favor of Daniel Shays due to the perception of overzealousness on his part, by his men. As a lieutenant, and then a captain, he served for eight years and participated in many key battles of the American Revolutionary War, including the Siege of Boston, Quebec Expedition, Battles of Saratoga, Cherry Valley massacre, Sullivan Expedition and Siege of Yorktown. After the war, he joined the prestigious Society of the Cincinnati, which included the likes of George Washington and Alexander Hamilton.\n\nLuke Day Sr. was born July 21, 1743, in what is now West Springfield, Massachusetts, the son of Luke Day, Sr. and Jerusha (Skinner) Day. Luke was the eighth of seven siblings, and the oldest son. He was christened 10 days later at the First Congregational Church.\n\nOn August 20, 1762, he announced his intention of marriage to Lydia Kelsey, originally of Killingworth Township, Connecticut, then of Westfield, Massachusetts, daughter of Stephen Kelsey, Jr. and Lydia (Noble) Kelsey, and they married soon after. The Days and Kelseys had ties going back at least to the founding of Hartford, CT, where Robert Day and William Kelsey were neighbors. Luke and Lydia had ten children, although only five, four sons and a daughter, survived to adulthood.\n\nLuke was referred to as a Gentleman, and was well-educated. He was deeply religious and sought counsel from both his minister and the Bible itself for the grievances of the people. In particular, he was inspired by this Bible passage: \n\nThe Days were one of the most prominent families in West Springfield, holding many positions in the local and state government. His father's cousin, Colonel Benjamin Day was called \"the most prominent man on the west side of the river.\" In addition to having a successful military career, Benjamin served many terms as a representative to the General Court of Massachusetts, and was the first moderator and one of the original selectmen of West Springfield. Benjamin also raised ninety pounds for the purchase of arms to be used in the Revolutionary War. Another of his father's cousins, William Day, was a sea captain and a hero of the French and Indian War for capturing a French admiral, and was the subject of a painting by John Singleton Copley. William was a member of the committee that approved the Sheffield Declaration. This William Day is a potential candidate to be the Captain William Day who earned Revolutionary War fame as the first American sea captain to be recognized by a foreign government (France).\n\nLuke's cousin Josiah owned a home, which still stands today as the oldest known brick saltbox-style house in the country, and serves as a family museum. Luke is known to have trained his men in the commons area in front of this house, and it may have even served as his headquarters. Luke's brother-in-law (and first cousin) was Justin Morgan, who developed the Morgan horse breed and composed music, which survives today. Luke's brother, Thomas, also served in the Revolution as a lieutenant.\n\nDay, then a second lieutenant in Captain Enoch Chapin's company of minutemen, marched on Boston on April 20, 1775, in response to the Lexington Alarm of the previous day. He served in Danielson's Regiment for the remainder of 1775 during the Siege of Boston. \n\nOn January 1, 1777 he was commissioned a captain in the 7th Massachusetts Regiment and served until his discharge on June 20, 1783. \n\nHe was an original member of the Massachusetts Society of the Cincinnati.\n\nThe Society of the Cincinnati, which he had joined to solidify his legacy, dismissed him as a member on July 13, 1787, due to his involvement in Shays' Rebellion. When Luke, Sr. died in 1791, Luke, Jr. was not named in his will. It is not known whether this was due to his participation in the rebellion, or other factors. He was brought to court several times for unpaid mortgage debts. Luke was known to have suffered from gout in his later years, and lived out his life in relative poverty and obscurity.\n\nOn June 1, 1801, shortly before his 58th birthday, Luke died at his home in West Springfield. Due to his infamy at the time as leader of Shays' Rebellion, he was buried next to his mother in an unmarked grave at Paucatuck Cemetery to prevent desecration, and only received a headstone almost two centuries later, in 1987, via the Ramapogue Historical Society.\n"}

It is a centre-left political organization in Serbia, founded after 2017 presidential elections, by Saša Janković, who ended up second with nearly 17% of the vote. It has no representatives in the National Assembly, since it was founded after the last parliamentary elections in Serbia.\n\nThe Movement's organizational structure includes Assembly, Presidency, Main board and Council.\n\nSince its inception it has positioned itself as a major opposition movement to government led by Serbian Progressive Party (SNS).\n\nSaša Janković was in the position of state ombudsman, and as such, he often criticized practices of the government, led by SNS and Vučić. This positioned him among voters as opposition spokesperson and led to him enjoying relatively high ratings in relation to actual opposition leaders and politicians. As his term was about to end, he decided to resign and run in the presidential elections, scheduled for April 2017. His most notable endorsement came from the Democratic Party, which decided to support Janković, rather than to have a candidate of its own. This helped him create a relatively united front against Vučić in the upcoming elections.\n\nIn the aftermath of the elections, Janković, who finished second with 16.3% of the vote, decided to form his own political movement, rather than joining the Democratic Party. His movement \"Apel 100\", formed for the purposes of gathering support from intellectuals and other notable citizens for his presidential candidacy, was thereby transformed into a political organization, the Movement of Free Citizens.\n\nDespite competing against each other in the presidential election, Janković's movement now cooperates closely with the People's Party, a party formed by Vuk Jeremić after the election.\n\nMany of the founding members have left the Movement, accusing Janković of running it like his own 'company', and revealed that Janković's wife exerts enormous influence on how the Movement is run. Following the accusations, the Movement's Presidency held an emergency meeting, where Janković offered his resignation, a motion denied by the Presidency. This turmoil within the Movement led political analysts and other opposition leaders and politicians to question the capacity of Janković and the Movement to lead the opposition against Vučić's government.\n\n"}

{"id": "3981741", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=3981741", "title": "Neopatrimonialism", "text": "Neopatrimonialism\n\nNeopatrimonialism is a system of social hierarchy where patrons use state resources in order to secure the loyalty of clients in the general population. It is an informal patron–client relationship that can reach from very high up in state structures down to individuals in small villages.\n\nNeopatrimonialism may underlie or supplant the bureaucratic structure of the state in that only those with connections have the real power, not those who hold higher positions. Further criticisms include that it undermines political institutions and the rule of law, and is a corrupt (but not always illegal) practice. Neopatrimonialism also has its benefits, however. Neopatrimonialism can extend the reach of the state into the geographical and social peripheries of the country, provide short term stability, and facilitate communal integration.\n\nNeo-patrimonialism, as defined by author Christopher Clapham of \"The Nature of the Third World State\", is a \"form of organisation in which relationships of a broadly patrimonial type pervade a political and administrative system which is formally constructed on rational-legal lines\". It is a system in which an office of power is used for personal uses and gains, as opposed to a strict division of the private and public spheres.\n\n\"Neopatrimonialism\" as a distinct term is generally held to have originated with Shmuel N. Eisenstadt, in his 1973 book \"Traditional Patrimonialism and Modern Neopatrimonialism\", deriving it from Max Weber's term, 'patrimonialism', who used the latter term to describe a system of rule based on administrative and military personnel, who were responsible only to the ruler. Neo-Patrimonialism, which is a modern form of the traditional Patrimonial form of rule, is a mixed system. Here elements of patrimonial and rational-bureaucratic rule co-exist and are sometimes interwoven.\n\nNeopatrimonialism is sometimes used as a way of explaining why African states have \"failed\" to effect neoliberal market reforms. This focus is controversial, with some complaining that the term is vague, and others that its use has failed to take into account the politics of non-African states. For example, in 1998 Thandika Mkandawire said,\n\nAnother problem is that \"neo-patrimonial\" states in and outside Africa have pursued a wide range of policies including some that are squarely developmental. In other words, other than indicating the style of governance, neo-patrimonialism does not tell us much about what policies a state will pursue and with what success. In the African case \"neo-patrimonialism\" has been used to explain import substitution, export orientation, parastatals, privatization, the informal sector development, etc. The result is that, in seeking to explain everything, it explains nothing except perhaps that capitalist relations in their idealized form are not pervasive in Africa.\nOthers have argued that the concept is valid and needs refinement. For example, a paper in 2004 identified political difficulties in Bangladesh as having their origins in the neopatrimonial system that had evolved there.\n\nNicolas Van de Walle argues that neopatrimonialism is very prevalent in Africa. African regimes are presidential, which facilitates clientelism since power is concentrated in a single individual with ultimate control of networks. As Joel Migdal puts it, the state in African countries seems omnipresent in all aspects of people’s lives, from the very local to the central government levels.\nVan de Walle introduces the notion that in Africa, states are hybrid regimes where patrimonial practices and bureaucracies coexist to a higher or lesser degree. African states have laws and constitutional order and in parallel are ruled by patrimonial logic in which political authority is based on clientelism and office holders constantly appropriate public resources for their own benefit. The dual nature of African regimes means that clientelism is not incidental and cannot be easily corrected with capacity building policies and at the same time formal structures play an important role, even in the least-institutionalized states. \n\nAccording to Van de Walle, one of the main issues with neopatrionialism is that it undermines economic reform in contemporary Africa on multiple levels. Joel Migdal points out that state leaders will fragment power and use different techniques to prevent reform and policy from being implemented in local branches and institutions, as a way to avoid important local agencies to mobilize against the central power. The main goal of central leaders is to avoid losing power and control, even if that means stalling policy implementation.\n\n\n"}

It is often referred to as 'OA', and is the Californian High School version of persuasive speeches. The speaker has ten minutes to present a problem, its significance, and a legislative solution to fix the stated problem. The problem is not a general one, such as apathy, but is a more specific one that can be legislated and solved, such as medical malpractice or statutory rape. The speaker should also include some discussion of how the proposed solution will actually solve the problem. However, the legislature included should be plausible and sensible. While the speeches used to be mostly serious in nature, the trend has now changed such that speeches contain more humorous material and even some acting. However, the winning speeches generally stick to the traditional, more analytical way of speaking. One theme that hasn't changed is that speeches generally have very specific topics ranging from domestic issues to international issues. Generally, the speeches are inspiring and informative. These speeches should have statistics, numbers, and proof (typically consisting of real stories found in the news) to support the various claims made by the speaker, though many speeches nowadays replace many statistics with jokes. Judges can evaluate this speech on any criteria, but usually the style of delivery (measured by the fluidity of the speech as well as the hand gestures, eye contact, memorization, posture, and tone) and content (the proof offered to prove the claims of problems) serve as fair and impartial indicators.\n"}

Nevada is the only state that requires a QI to be licensed.\n\nThe QI enters into a written agreement with the taxpayer where QI transfers the relinquished property to the buyer, and transfers the replacement property to the taxpayer pursuant to the exchange agreement. The QI holds the proceeds from the sale of the relinquished property in a trust or escrow account in order to ensure the Taxpayer never has actual or constructive receipt of the sale proceeds. \n\nWhen selecting a Qualified Intermediary (QI), it is important to consider the fact that there is little regulation governing these entities. Therefore, conducting due diligence is crucial in order to ensure the exchange funds are being held in a safe manner and the Exchanger's (entity/individual deferring taxes via 1031 Exchange) funds are protected in the event the Qualified Intermediary can't provide the funds at closing. In addition to that, it's important to make sure the QI being used is experienced and understands the tax code thoroughly.\n\nIRC §1441 et seq. regulates the withholding of income taxes from payments of U.S. source income made to a non-U.S. person. Generally, the U.S. payor must verify the Tax Identification Number (TIN) of its payees and withhold 30% of this payment if a TIN is not presented. A §1441 Qualified Intermediary (QI) is generally a foreign bank or other foreign financial institution that signs an agreement with the Internal Revenue Service (IRS). Under the agreement, the QI maintains its own records of the U.S. or foreign status of the beneficial owners of the payments and may undertake responsibility for income reporting and tax withholding. The QI agreement is valid for 6 years and the QI entity is subject to an IRS or external audit periodically to confirm compliance with the agreement terms. The §1441 QI regime was later supplemented by foreign account reporting requirements under the Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "23518867", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=23518867", "title": "Recording (real estate)", "text": "Recording (real estate)\n\nThe vast majority of states in the United States employ a system of recording legal instruments (otherwise known as deeds registration) that affect the title of real estate as the exclusive means for publicly documenting land titles and interests. This system differs significantly from land registration systems, such as the Torrens system that have been adopted in a few states. The principal difference is that the recording system does not determine who owns the title or interest involved, which is ultimately determined through litigation in the courts. The system provides a framework for determining who the law will protect in relation to those titles and interests when a dispute arises.\n\nThe recording systems are established by state statute. They usually provide for the office of a recorder in each county or other jurisdiction. The names of these offices are usually the \"Recorder of Deeds\" or something similar. State statutes also prescribe the following elements:\n\n\nA Grantor/Grantee title search attempts to locate records by searching the parties listed on a recorded instrument. One approach to conducting a full Grantor/Grantee title search starts by searching the grantor index in the County records and determining the name of the first recorded owner of title. This is usually the sovereign, which is the Federal Government or the Crown of the nation which owned a former colony now located within the United States. The search finds the grant from the sovereign to the first grantee. This is usually in the form of a patent. Then, the grantee's name is searched in the grantor index to find the deed by which it has subsequently conveyed the title, and so forth until no more grants are found. Liens or encumbrances granted by any of the parties shown on recorded instruments are also found in the search. Though theoretically accurate, this approach has practical difficulties due to there often being numerous grants from the sovereign. Therefore, an alternative method is to reverse the process, i.e. to search backward in the grantee index. This is done by beginning with the name of the person or entity who is thought to own the land to find the grantor to it. Then the grantee index is searched again to find the source of that grantor's title, and so on until you reach the grant from the sovereign. These linkages from grantor to grantee are called the \"chain of title.\" The last grantee found is the \"record title holder.\"\n\nIn municipalities with a large population and states that do not support tract indices, the Grantor/Grantee method can be time consuming and difficult altogether due to common names within the index. In these municipalities, a geographic index is often created to aid in title searching. In this system, each document is posted in both a Grantor and Grantee index in addition to being posted to indexes describing attributes of the property's location such as a lot number, subdivision name or Parcel Identification Number (PIN). With a functioning geographic index, a search can be done with a combination of a Grantor/Grantee, Legal Description or PIN search.\n\nThe record title holder is not necessarily the actual owner of the land if there are previous unrecorded deeds to it to others. The principal legal theory is that once a person has conveyed the title to his or her property (or some aspect of it) to someone, he or she has nothing left to transfer to any subsequent person. However, as a result of the various state recording acts, the courts will protect a bona fide purchaser who pays valuable consideration and doesn't have knowledge of the prior unrecorded deed from the claims of a prior grantee under that deed. The same is true respecting most types of unrecorded liens or encumbrances. For example, purchasers of the land from the record title holder who pay valuable consideration and have no knowledge of unrecorded mortgages will be protected against those mortgages by the courts. All of this flows from the statement in most recording statutes that the unrecorded instruments are void against such purchasers. Also, U.S. law permits the bankruptcy trustee of a debtor to set aside property interests the debtor has conveyed if a bona fide purchaser of the real estate, who properly perfected its interest, would be protected against the conveyance. Therefore, it behooves purchasers and mortgage lenders to record their deeds or mortgages, respectively, to prevent this outcome.\n\nOnce an instrument affecting the title to real estate has been recorded, the law holds that everyone is deemed to know of its existence, even if they haven't searched the records in the recorder's office. This is the doctrine of \"constructive notice\" and it is nearly universal in the various states of the U.S. So, for example, after a deed or mortgage has been recorded by someone in the chain of title, no subsequent purchaser will be protected against it. The reason is that the recording laws deem everyone to know of its existence once it is recorded.\n\nEach U.S. state has a recording act, a statute which dictates the legal procedure by which an individual claiming an interest in real property (real estate) formally establishes their claim to that property. The recordation of property rights becomes particularly significant where an unscrupulous dealer in land purports to sell the same tract of land multiple times. With other kinds of property, the first buyer would be the owner of the property, and later owners would have no interest in the property and would instead have a cause of action against the original seller for fraud. With real property, however, the first buyer is not necessarily the owner, depending on the kind of statute under which the recording of such property interests operates. There are three basic kinds of statutory schemes in recording acts: race, notice, and race/notice.\n\nEven though a recording act does not require recordation, the law does create strong incentive for a buyer to record. Recordation provides constructive notice to any subsequent purchasers that a prior conveyance occurred and therefore protects the prior purchaser in the event of a subsequent conveyance.\n\nUnder a race statute, whoever records first wins. Thus, if Oscar purports to sell a piece of land to Al for $100,000, and the next day purports to sell exactly the same piece of land to Bob for another $100,000, then whichever of the two buyers is the first to reach the recording office and have the sale recorded will be deemed the owner of the property. Thus, if Bob is the first to record the conveyance, he will be the owner even if he knew about the prior conveyance to Al. Race statutes are extremely rare because it is generally viewed as unfair to protect a party who had actual notice of a prior conveyance. Currently, Delaware, North Carolina, and Louisiana are the only jurisdictions where a race statute is in effect. The benefit of a pure race statute is that it encourages all grantees to record their interest quickly.\n\nUnder a notice statute, a subsequent purchaser for value wins if, at the time of conveyance, that subsequent purchaser had no actual or constructive notice of the prior conveyance. In short, a subsequent bona fide purchaser wins. Thus, if Oscar purports to sell a piece of land to Al for $100,000, and the next day purports to sell exactly the same piece of land to Bob for another $100,000, then Bob will own the land so long as he was not aware of the prior sale to Al. However, note that if Al \"records\" his interest before Bob's purchase, this recordation will be deemed to give Bob constructive notice. If Bob purchases the land without notice, and Al then \"records\" his prior purchase before Bob records his own purchase, then Bob will still prevail in ownership of the land. The benefit of a pure notice statute is that it encourages Al to record quickly, but if Al records after Bob's purchase, Bob has only limited incentive to record his conveyance immediately. This can leave the land records incomplete for an indeterminate amount of time and could cause Al to make improvements of which he might be divested by Bob's later recorded deed.\n\nUnder a race/notice statute, a subsequent purchaser for value wins if (1) at the time of conveyance, that subsequent purchaser had no actual or constructive notice of the prior conveyance, and (2) the subsequent purchaser records before the prior purchaser. In short, a subsequent purchaser in good faith wins only if he records before the prior purchaser does. In this type of system, if Oscar purports to sell a piece of land to Al for $100,000, and the next day purports to sell exactly the same piece of land to Bob for another $100,000, then Bob will own the land only if he was not aware of the prior sale to Al, \"and\" if Bob actually records his interest before Al does. In the hybrid race/notice statute, all grantees have a strong incentive to record early, thereby making the land records complete.\n\nAs can be seen from the foregoing, there are limitations to the protection of most recording laws. Persons who don't pay valuable consideration for their interest in the property are not protected against unrecorded interests. Examples are persons getting the property as a gift and heirs. Neither are persons who purchase ownership interests in the \"owners\" of the property, e.g., shares of stock in a corporation owning the land, because they haven't purchased an interest in the property itself. Also, the recording laws generally do not protect purchasers against real estate taxes because notice of them is usually not required to be recorded for them to be effective. Finally, certain classes of nongovernmental liens such as mechanic's liens are often made effective for a certain period of time even though unrecorded. This list is not exhaustive.\n\n"}
{"id": "3263089", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=3263089", "title": "Resistant starch", "text": "Resistant starch\n\nResistant starch (RS) is starch, including its degradation products, that escapes from digestion in the small intestine of healthy individuals. Resistant starch occurs naturally in foods but is also added to foods by the addition of isolated or manufactured types of resistant starch.\n\nSome types of resistant starch (RS1, RS2 and RS3) are fermented by the large intestinal microbiota, conferring benefits to human health through the production of short-chain fatty acids, increased bacterial mass, and promotion of butyrate-producing bacteria.\n\nResistant starch in various ways has similar physiologic effect as dietary fiber, which is why it functions as a mild laxative and why consuming it at high doses can lead to flatulence.\n\nThe concept of resistant starch arose from research in the 1970s and is currently considered to be one of three starch types: rapidly digested starch, slowly digested starch and resistant starch, each of which may affect levels of blood glucose.\n\nThe European Commission has supported research eventually leading to a definition of resistant starch.\n\nResistant starch does not release glucose within the small intestine, but rather reaches the large intestine where it is consumed or fermented by colonic bacteria (gut microbiota). On a daily basis, human intestinal microbiota encounter more carbohydrates than any other dietary component. This includes resistant starch, non-starch polysaccharide fibers, oligosaccharides, and simple sugars which have significance in colon health.\n\nThe fermentation of resistant starch produces short-chain fatty acids, including acetate, propionate, and butyrate and increased bacterial cell mass. The short-chain fatty acids are produced in the large intestine where they are rapidly absorbed from the colon, then are metabolized in colonic epithelial cells, liver or other tissues. The fermentation of resistant starch produces more butyrate than other types of dietary fibers.\n\nModest amounts of gases such as carbon dioxide, methane, and hydrogen are also produced in intestinal fermentation. One review estimated that the acceptable daily intake of resistant starch may be as high as 45 grams in adults, an amount exceeding the total recommended intake for dietary fiber of 25–38 grams per day. When isolated resistant starch is used to substitute for flour in foods, the glycemic response of that food is reduced.\n\nIn 2016, the U.S. FDA approved a qualified health claim stating that resistant starch might reduce the risk of type 2 diabetes, but with qualifying language for product labels that limited scientific evidence exists to support this claim. Because \"qualified\" health claims are issued when the science evidence is weak or not consistent, the FDA requires specific labeling language, such as the guideline concerning resistant starch: \"High-amylose maize resistant starch may reduce the risk of Type 2 diabetes. FDA has concluded that there is limited scientific evidence for this claim.\"\n\nPlants produce starch with different types of structure and shape characteristics which may affect digestion. For instance, smaller starch granules are more available to enzyme digestion because the larger percentage of surface area increases the enzyme binding rate.\n\nStarch consists of amylose and amylopectin which affect the textural properties of manufactured foods. Starches with high amylose content generally have increased resistant starch.\n\nResistant starch (RS) is any starch or starch digestion products that are not digested and absorbed in the stomach or small intestine and pass on to the large intestine. RS has been categorized into four types:\n\n\nProcessing may affect the natural resistant starch content of foods. In general, processes that break down structural barriers to digestion reduce resistant starch content, with greater reductions resulting from processing. Whole grain wheat may contain as high as 14% resistant starch, while milled wheat flour may contain only 2%. Resistant starch content of cooked rice may decrease due to grinding or cooking.\n\nOther types of processing increase resistant starch content. If cooking includes excess water, the starch is gelatinized and becomes more digestible. However, if these starch gels are then cooled, they can form starch crystals resistant to digestive enzymes (Type RS3 or retrograded resistant starch), such as those occurring in cooked and cooled cereals or potatoes (e.g., potato salad). Cooling a boiled potato overnight increases the amount of resistant starch.\n\nResistant starch is considered both a dietary fiber and a functional fiber, depending on whether it is naturally in foods or added. Although the U.S. Institute of Medicine has defined total fiber as equal to functional fiber plus dietary fiber, U.S. food labeling does not distinguish between them.\n\nThe Institute of Medicine Panel on the Definition of Dietary Fiber proposed two definitions: functional fiber as \"isolated, nondigestible carbohydrates that have beneficial physiological effects in humans\", and dietary fiber as \"nondigestible carbohydrates and lignin that are intrinsic and intact in plants.\" They also proposed that the prior classifications of soluble versus insoluble be phased out and replaced with viscous versus fermentable for each specific fiber.\n\nStarch has been consumed by people and animals for thousands of years. Thus, foods containing resistant starch are already commonly consumed.\n\nIt has been estimated that average resistant starch intake in developed countries ranges from 3–6 grams/day for Northern Europeans, Australians and Americans, 8.5 grams/day for Italians and 10–15 grams/day in Indian and Chinese diets. The higher consumption of starch-containing foods like pasta and rice likely accounts for higher intake of resistant starch in Italy, India and China.\n\nSeveral studies have found that the traditional African diet is high in resistant starch. Rural black South Africans consume an average of 38 grams of resistant starch per day by having cooked and cooled corn porridge and beans in their diets.\n\nIsolated and extracted resistant starch and foods rich in resistant starch have been used to fortify foods to increase their dietary fiber content. Typically, food fortification utilizes RS2 resistant starch from high amylose corn, RS3 resistant starch from cassava and RS4 resistant starch from wheat and potato, as these sources can survive varying degrees of food processing without losing their resistant starch content.\n\nResistant starch has a small particle size, white appearance, bland flavor and low water-holding capacity. Resistant starch typically replaces flour in foods such as bread and other baked goods, pasta, cereal and batters because it can produce foods with similar color and texture of the original food. It has also been used for its textural properties in imitation cheese.\n\nSome types of resistant starch are used as dietary supplements in the United States. RS2 from potato starch and green banana starch maintain their resistance as long as they are consumed raw and unheated. If they are heated or baked, these types of starch may become rapidly digestible. RS2 resistant starch from high amylose corn can be consumed raw or baked into foods.\n"}

In a few cases the \"sanjak-bey\" was himself directly answerable to Istanbul.\n\nLike other early Ottoman administrative offices, the \"sanjak-bey\" had a military origin: the term \"sanjak\" (and \"liva\") means \"flag\" or \"standard\" and denoted the insigne around which, in times of war, the cavalrymen holding fiefs (\"timars\" or \"ziamets\") in the specific district gathered. The \"sanjkabey\" was in turn subordinate to a \"beylerbey\" (\"Bey of Beys\") who governed an \"eyalet\" and commanded his subordinate \"sanjak-beys\" in war. In this way, the structure of command on the battlefield resembled the hierarchy of provincial government.\n\nThe office of \"sanjak-bey\" resembled that of the \"beylerbey\" on a more modest scale. Like the \"beylerbey\", the \"sanjak-bey\" drew his income from a prebend, which consisted usually of revenues from the towns, quays and ports within the boundary of his \"sanjak\". Within his own sanjak, a governor was responsible above all for maintaining order and, with the cooperation of the fief holders, arresting and punishing wrongdoers. For this, he usually received half of the fines imposed on miscreants, with the fief holder on whose lands the misdeed took place, receiving the other half. \"Sanjak\" governors also had other duties, for example, the pursuit of bandits, the investigation of heretics, the provision of supplies for the army, or the despatch of materials for shipbuilding, as the sultan commanded.\n\n"}
{"id": "304176", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=304176", "title": "Shalom", "text": "Shalom\n\nShalom ( \"shalom\"; also spelled as \"sholom\", \"sholem\", \"sholoim\", \"shulem\") is a Hebrew word meaning \"peace\", \"harmony\", \"wholeness\", \"completeness\", \"prosperity\", \"welfare\" and \"tranquility\" and can be used idiomatically to mean both \"hello\" and \"goodbye\".\n\nAs it does in English, it can refer to either peace between two entities (especially between man and God or between two countries), or to the well-being, welfare or safety of an individual or a group of individuals. The word shalom is also found in many other expressions and names. Its equivalent cognate in Arabic is \"salaam\", \"sliem\" in Maltese, Shlama in Syriac-Assyrian and \"sälam\" in Ethiopian Semitic languages from the Proto-Semitic root Š-L-M.\n\nIn Hebrew, words are built on \"roots\", generally of three consonants. When the root consonants appear with various vowels and additional letters, a variety of words, often with some relation in meaning, can be formed from a single root. Thus from the root \"sh-l-m\" come the words \"shalom\" (\"peace, well-being\"), \"hishtalem\" (\"it was worth it\"), \"shulam\" (\"was paid for\"), \"meshulam\" (\"paid for in advance\"), \"mushlam\" (\"perfect\"), and \"shalem\" (\"whole\").\n\nIn translations of the Bible, \"shalom\" may be translated as \"peace\" (English), \"paz\" (Spanish and Portuguese), \"paix\" (French), \"pace\" (Italian), or \"pax\" (Latin). The concept of peace is important in Christianity.\n\nBiblically, \"shalom\" is seen in reference to the well-being of others (Genesis 43:27, Exodus 4:18), to treaties (I Kings 5:12), and in prayer for the wellbeing of cities or nations (Psalm 122:6, Jeremiah 29:7). \n\nThe meaning of completeness, central to the term \"shalom\", can also be confirmed in related terms found in other Semitic languages. The Assyrian term \"salamu\" means to be complete, unharmed, paid/atoned. \"Sulmu\", another Assyrian term, means welfare. A closer relation to the idea of \"shalom\" as concept and action is seen in the Arabic root \"salaam\", meaning to be safe, secure and forgiven, among other things.\n\nThe word \"shalom\" can be used for all parts of speech; as a noun, adjective, verb, adverb, and interjection. It categorizes all shaloms. The word \"shalom\" is used in a variety of expressions and contexts in Hebrew speech and writing:\n\n\nIn Judaism, Shalom (peace), is one of the underlying principles of the Torah: \"Her ways are pleasant ways and all her paths are shalom (peace)\".\" The Talmud explains, \"The entire Torah is for the sake of the ways of shalom\". Maimonides comments in his Mishneh Torah: \"Great is peace, as the whole Torah was given in order to promote peace in the world, as it is stated, 'Her ways are pleasant ways and all her paths are peace'\".\n\nIn the book \"Not the Way It's Supposed to Be: A Breviary of Sin\", author Cornelius Plantinga described the Old Testament concept of shalom:\n\nThe webbing together of God, humans, and all creation in justice, fulfillment, and delight is what the Hebrew prophets call shalom. We call it peace but it means far more than mere peace of mind or a cease-fire between enemies. In the Bible, shalom means universal flourishing, wholeness and delight – a rich state of affairs in which natural needs are satisfied and natural gifts fruitfully employed, a state of affairs that inspires joyful wonder as its Creator and Savior opens doors and welcomes the creatures in whom he delights. Shalom, in other words, is the way things ought to be.\n\nThe Talmud says, \"the name of God is 'Peace'\", therefore, one is not permitted to greet another with the word \"shalom\" in places such as a bathroom.\n\nBiblical references make many Christians teach that \"Shalom\" is one of the sacred names of God.\n\n\"Shalom\" is also common in modern Hebrew in Israel, as a given name or a surname. It is usually used by men as a given name but there are women named Shalom as well such as the model Shalom Harlow.\n\n\n\"Shalom\" can be part of an organization's name.\n\nFor example, the names of the following organizations and places refer to \"peace\" between Israel and its Arab neighbors:\n\n\n\"Shalom\" is used as part of other names, such as for synagogues, as in:\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

The concept is closely related but not identical to the political theory of Maoism-Third Worldism.\n\nThe political thinkers and leaders of Third-Worldism argued that the North-South divisions and conflicts were of primary political importance compared to the East-West opposition of the Cold War period. In the Three-World Model, the countries of the First World were the ones allied to the United States. These nations had, and still have, less political risk, better functioning democracy and economic stability, as well as higher standard of living. The Second World designation referred to the former industrial socialist states under the influence of the Soviet Union. The Third World hence defined countries that remained non-aligned with either NATO, or the Communist Bloc. The Third World was normally seen to include many countries with colonial pasts in Africa, Latin America, Oceania and Asia. It was also sometimes taken as synonymous with countries in the Non-Aligned Movement, connected to the world economic division as \"periphery\" countries in the world system that is dominated by the \"core\" countries.\n\nThird-Worldism was connected to new political movements following the Decolonization and new forms of regionalism that emerged in the erstwhile colonies of Asia, Africa, and the Middle-East, as well as in the older nation-states of Latin America : pan-arabism, pan-africanism, pan-americanism and pan-asianism.\n\nThe first period of the Third-World movement, that of the \"first Bandung Era\", was led by the Egyptian, Indonesian and Indian heads of states : Nasser, Sukarno and Nehru.

{"id": "26054494", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=26054494", "title": "Trial of Geert Wilders", "text": "Trial of Geert Wilders\n\nThe trial of Geert Wilders, a member of the House of Representatives of the Netherlands, took place in the Netherlands in 2010 and 2011. Wilders was accused of criminally insulting religious and ethnic groups and inciting hatred and discrimination. He was found not guilty in June 2011.\n\nThe leader of the Party for Freedom, Wilders has been the source of great controversy in the Netherlands and abroad for his criticism of Islam and what he describes as the Islamization of the Netherlands. At his trial, he faced five counts of criminal offenses. The first charge was of criminally insulting Muslims because of their religion. The remaining four charges pertained to incitement of hatred and discrimination of Muslims, Moroccans, and other non-Western immigrants because of their race or ethnicity. These charges stemmed from articles Wilders had written between 2006 and 2008, as well as his short film \"Fitna\". These statements included a call for a ban on the Quran, warnings against an \"Islamic invasion,\" and a \"tsunami of Islamization.\" He also labeled Islam a fascist religion, described Dutch-Moroccan youths as violent, and compared the Quran with Hitler's \"Mein Kampf\". He has also referred to Mohammed as \"the devil.\"\n\nThe judges in the first trial were removed due to perceived bias against Wilders, so a retrial began in February 2011. The Dutch Public Prosecution Service, after initially refusing to prosecute Wilders because it did not consider his statements illegal, was ordered by a court of appeal to prosecute him nonetheless. During the process, they argued that Wilders should be acquitted on all counts.\n\nOn 23 June 2011, Wilders was acquitted of all charges, with Judge Marcel van Oosten noting that his statements, although \"gross and denigrating,\" had not given rise to hatred against Muslims, and as such were \"acceptable within the context of public debate.\" Van Oosten also said, however, that Wilders's statements were on the edge of legal acceptability.\n\nAccording to Article 71 of the Dutch Constitution, as an MP, Wilders has immunity with regard to anything he says in or writes to parliament. However, this protection does not extend to opinions expressed outside of parliament, allowing for prosecution based on his criticism of Islam. The possibility that Wilders could be prosecuted became clear between 2007 and 2010, when protests against alleged insults and incitement to hatred resulted in his criminal prosecution by the district attorney in Amsterdam. On 3 February 2010, the Amsterdam court ruled itself to be competent on the charges against Wilders.\n\nSome of his public comments, as well as some of the content of Wilders' film \"Fitna\", have been protested by agencies such as the Dutch anti-discrimination group \"Nederland Bekent Kleur\" (). On 15 August 2007, a representative of the public prosecution service in Amsterdam declared that dozens of reports filed against Wilders were being considered.\n\nAttempts to prosecute Wilders under Dutch anti-hate speech laws in June 2008 were dropped, with the public prosecution stating that Wilders' comments contributed to the debate on Islam in Dutch society and had been made outside parliament. The office released a statement reading: \"That comments are hurtful and offensive for a large number of Muslims does not mean that they are punishable. Freedom of expression fulfils an essential role in public debate in a democratic society. That means that offensive comments can be made in a political debate.\"\n\nThe plaintiffs (\"Nederlands Bekent Kleur\", organisations of Turkish, Moroccan and Antillean people in the Netherlands, and an organization of mosques) appealed against the prosecution's decision to not pursue the case and on 21 January 2009, a three-judge court of appeal ordered the public prosecutor to try Wilders. Their statement said that \"[i]n a democratic system, hate speech is considered so serious that it is in the general interest to... draw a clear line\" and that \"the court also considers appropriate criminal prosecution for insulting Muslim worshippers because of comparisons between Islam and Nazism made by Wilders\". If convicted, he could have been sentenced for up to 16 months of jail time or a fine of €9866.67. His lawyer Bram Moszkowicz tried to have the appeal overturned at the Supreme Court of the Netherlands, but the Supreme Court's Procurator General decided he would not hear the case.\n\nOn 4 December 2009, Wilders was ordered to appear before the court on 20 January 2010 to defend himself against the charges of group insult of Muslims, fomenting hate and discrimination against Muslims because of their religion, and fomenting hate and discrimination against non-Western foreigners or Moroccans because of their race. On 11 January 2010, the Dutch public prosecution service brought additional charges against him, charging him with hatred against Moroccans and non-Western immigrants.\n\nOn 13 January 2010, the Amsterdam court rejected, after a closed pretrial hearing, submissions by Wilders that one of the charges against him should be dropped or reduced. He argued that he had only criticized Islam and not its adherents, and that the charge of insulting Muslims as a group should not stand. His lawyer Moszkowicz petitioned judges to drop the charge of insulting Muslims as a group, which he said would have little chance of winning a conviction. He cited a 2009 Dutch Supreme Court ruling that found insulting a religion is not the same as insulting followers of that religion, and not punishable under the current hate speech laws. The judge said that the indictment only put into practice an earlier court ruling that he should stand trial and that the defense had not put forward any new evidence to overturn the ruling.\n\nIn total, Wilders was charged with the following five counts:\n\nThe first charge is based on article 137c of the Dutch criminal code, and the rest are based on article 137d, both concerning hate speech.\n\nCourt proceedings began on 20 January 2010, with Wilders accused of discrimination on the basis of religion and spreading hate. On the eve of his trial, Wilders told journalists he expected to be acquitted, saying, \"I have done nothing wrong.\" After receiving the summons, he commented that he considered the prosecution as \"a political trial.\" He also announced his intention to call various experts to act as witnesses. On the first day of the trial, Wilders gave a speech invoking Thomas Jefferson, among others.\n\nWhen the trial resumed on 3 February, the judges decided who would be allowed to testify as witnesses. Wilders's desired witness list consisted of various experts on both the law and Islam, including university professors, radical imams, and Mohammed Bouyeri, the man who murdered filmmaker Theo van Gogh. Other individuals on the list included Afshin Ellian, a Dutch-Iranian professor at Leiden University; Hans Jansen, a Dutch scholar of Islam; Wafa Sultan, a Syrian American physician; Raphael Israeli, a Moroccan-Israeli professor at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem; Andrew G. Bostom, an American professor at Alpert Medical School of Brown University; Robert Spencer, an American author and blogger; and Ayatollahs Ahmad Jannati and Mohammad Yazdii, members of the Iranian Guardian Council.\n\nThe court rejected 15 of Wilders's 18 desired witnesses, ruling that Bouyeri and other Muslim extremists would not be allowed to testify in the case. The court accepted only the three Islam experts whom Wilders had called, rejecting the lawyers and Islamic extremists. The court also rejected the plea by Wilders's lawyer to transfer the case to the Supreme Court due to Wilders status as an MP. The court overruled this objection against its jurisdiction. \"Parliamentary immunity does not extend to what a public representative says or writes outside of parliamentary gatherings.\" said Jan Moors, one of the judges at the Amsterdam court. Wilders consequently argued that he was being denied his right to a fair trial.\n\nDuring the trial it became clear that the prosecutors were arguing for Wilders to be acquitted on all five counts.\n\nOn 22 October 2010, when the trial was nearing its conclusion, Wilders's attorney Moszkowicz asked for the judges to be substituted because of a perceived bias against his client. Moszkowicz had unsuccessfully asked for substitution before. The second request was made because Tom Schalken, one of the judges in the court of appeal case that ordered the prosecution of Wilders on 21 January 2009 had allegedly tried to convince a witness in the main trial, Hans Jansen, that the trial was justified. Moszkowicz wanted to hear this witness immediately regarding the alleged conflict of interest, but the court decided it would not hear the witness. The substitution chamber decided that this decision had an appearance of bias and awarded the substitution, thereby ordering a retrial.\n\nIn the meantime, the alleged victims argued to the court of appeal that the prosecutors, by arguing for acquittal, had not fulfilled the court's order that Wilders had to be prosecuted, and that they should be replaced in the retrial. On 4 February 2011, the court of appeal decided against this complaint.\n\nOn 7 February 2011, the retrial started. In the period between the trials, police investigated the claims that appellate judge Tom Schalken had tried to influence witness Hans Jansen. The new trial began with hearing the witnesses Schalken, Jansen, and Bertus Hendriks; the latter had hosted the dinner party at which Schalken spoke to Jansen. Moszkowicz argued that the trial against Geert Wilders could not continue because the witness had been influenced. During the hearing of Hendriks, Moszkowicz claimed that Hendriks had committed perjury; when the judges did not agree, Moszkowicz tried unsuccessfully to have them substituted as well.\n\nOn 23 May 2011, the judges decided that although Schalken should not have talked to Jansen, the witness had not been influenced, and the case could continue. As in the first trial, the public prosecution argued that Wilders should be acquitted on all counts. On 1 June the hearings concluded, with Geert Wilders asking the judges to find him not guilty. On 23 June 2011, Wilders was acquitted by the court of all charges, because his statements were, as presiding judge Marcel van Oosten put it, \"acceptable within the context of public debate.\" Because both the public prosecutor and the defense requested complete acquittal, the verdict will most likely not be appealed, although some thought the plaintiffs might try to take the case before the European Court of Human Rights.\n\nDescribed by \"Haaretz\" as \"a high-profile affair,\" the trial attracted international attention. The prosecution was condemned by editorials in \"The Wall Street Journal,\" \"Investor's Business Daily,\" \"The Washington Times,\" \"The American Spectator,\" \"Forbes,\" \"The Dallas Morning News,\" \"City Journal,\" \"Montreal Gazette,\" \"The Jerusalem Post,\" Canada.com, and \"The Australian\". New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg criticized it in front of the Mayor of Amsterdam and the Dutch Ambassador to the United States. The People's Party for Freedom and Democracy called the case \"alarming.\"\n\nThe Dutch center-left Labour party welcomed the court's 2009 decision to prosecute Wilders, as did the Socialist Party. The Muslims and Government Consultative Body said that \"We are positive that this will contribute to a more respectful tone to the public debate.\" Abdelmajid Khairoun, Dutch Muslim Council chairman, expressed support, stating that \"Muslim youngsters who make anti-Semitic remarks are prosecuted but Wilders' anti-Islamic remarks go unpunished\".\n\nThe American Middle East Forum set up a legal defense fund for Wilders. \n\nThe Dutch writer and historian Ian Buruma, writing in an op-ed published in the \"New York Times\", argued that \"for a man who calls for a ban on the Koran to act as the champion of free speech is a bit rich.\"\n\nA February 2009 survey by Angus Reid Global Monitor found that Dutch public opinion was deeply split on the prosecution, with 50% supporting Wilders and 43% opposed. However, public support for the Party for Freedom vastly increased since Wilders's legal troubles began, virtually tying with the People's Party for Freedom and Democracy as the third most popular national party. According to Radio Netherlands, \"Dutch politicians themselves seem to be keeping quiet on the issue; they are probably worried that media attention will only serve to make the controversial politician more popular.\"\n\nRobert Spencer, creator of Jihad Watch and author of articles and books relating to Islam and Islamic terrorism, wrote on National Review Online that \"The Geert Wilders trial ought to be an international media event; seldom has any court case anywhere had such enormous implications for the future of the free world.\"\n\nWilders believed that his freedom of speech and traditional European freedoms were the primary subject of the trial. In February 2010, in an interview with Israel National Radio, Wilders said he was \"fighting for one thing: the preservation of our culture, which is based on Christianity, Judaism and humanism – and not on Islam... While Islamization of our society grows, the political elite looks in the other direction and ignores the real problem, namely, the impending loss of our freedom. I am fighting not against Moslems, but against the influx of a totalitarian ideology called Islam.\" He has cited Gregorius Nekschot, a similar case of Islam related free-speech restrictions, on his website.\n\nAfter being cleared of all charges, Wilders commented that the victory was not only an acquittal for himself, but a victory for freedom of expression in the Netherlands. Commentators believed that the plaintiffs may attempt to bring their case before the European Court of Human Rights. Gerard Spong, a lawyer instrumental in getting the case heard, expressed his disappointment with the verdict, seeing the judge's ruling based on \"public context\" as vague. Theo de Roos, professor of law at the Tilburg University, saw the case as a precedent for ethnic incitement in Dutch law, prohibiting only actual threats.\n\n\n\nWebsites dedicated to the trial:\n"}
{"id": "1359364", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1359364", "title": "Tsunami warning system", "text": "Tsunami warning system\n\nA tsunami warning system (TWS) is used to detect tsunamis in advance and issue warnings to prevent loss of life and damage to property. It is made up of two equally important components: a network of sensors to detect tsunamis and a communications infrastructure to issue timely alarms to permit evacuation of the coastal areas. There are two distinct types of tsunami warning systems: international and regional. When operating, seismic alerts are used to instigate the watches and warnings; then, data from observed sea level height (either shore-based tide gauges or DART buoys) are used to verify the existence of a tsunami. Other systems have been proposed to augment the warning procedures; for example, it has been suggested that the duration and frequency content of t-wave energy (which is earthquake energy trapped in the ocean SOFAR channel) is indicative of an earthquake's tsunami potential.\n\nThe first rudimentary system to alert communities of an impending tsunami was attempted in Hawaii in the 1920s. More advanced systems were developed in the wake of the April 1, 1946 (caused by the 1946 Aleutian Islands earthquake) and May 23, 1960 (caused by the 1960 Valdivia earthquake) tsunamis which caused massive devastation in Hilo, Hawaii. While tsunamis travel at between 500 and 1,000 km/h (around 0.14 and 0.28 km/s) in open water, earthquakes can be detected almost at once as seismic waves travel with a typical speed of 4 km/s (around 14,400 km/h). This gives time for a possible tsunami forecast to be made and warnings to be issued to threatened areas, if warranted. Until a reliable model is able to predict which earthquakes will produce significant tsunamis, this approach will produce many more false alarms than verified warnings.\n\nTsunami warnings for most of the Pacific Ocean are issued by the Pacific Tsunami Warning Center (PTWC), operated by the United States NOAA in Ewa Beach, Hawaii. NOAA's National Tsunami Warning Center (NTWC) in Palmer, Alaska issues warnings for the west coast of North America, including Alaska, British Columbia, Oregon and California. The PTWC was established in 1949, following the 1946 Aleutian Island earthquake and a tsunami that resulted in 165 casualties on Hawaii and in Alaska; NTWC was founded in 1967. International coordination is achieved through the International Coordination Group for the Tsunami Warning System in the Pacific, established by the Intergovernmental Oceanographic Commission of UNESCO.\n\nIn 2017, The US congressional panel passed a vote to continue funding a global tsunami detection system that gives U.S. officials an accurate forecast in order to decrease damage cause by Tsunamis.\n\nAfter the 2004 Indian Ocean Tsunami which killed almost 250,000 people, a United Nations conference was held in January 2005 in Kobe, Japan, and decided that as an initial step towards an International Early Warning Programme, the UN should establish an Indian Ocean Tsunami Warning System. This then resulted in a system of warnings in Indonesia and other affected areas.\n\nThe First United Session of the Inter-governmental Coordination Group for the Tsunami Early Warning and Mitigation System in the North Eastern Atlantic, the Mediterranean and connected Seas (ICG/NEAMTWS), established by the Intergovernmental Oceanographic Commission of UNESCO Assembly during its 23rd Session in June 2005, through Resolution XXIII.14, took place in Rome on 21 and 22 November 2005.\n\nThe meeting, hosted by the Government of Italy (the Italian Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Italian Ministry for the Environment and Protection of Land and Sea), was attended by more than 150 participants from 24 countries, 13 organizations and numerous observers.\n\nA Caribbean-wide tsunami warning system was planned to be instituted by the year 2010, by representatives of Caribbean nations who met in Panama City in March 2008. Panama's last major tsunami killed 4,500 people in 1882. Barbados has said it will review or test its tsunami protocol in February 2010 as a regional pilot.\n\nRegional (or local) warning system centres use seismic data about nearby recent earthquakes to determine if there is a possible local threat of a tsunami. Such systems are capable of issuing warnings to the general public (via public address systems and sirens) in less than 15 minutes. Although the epicenter and moment magnitude of an underwater quake and the probable tsunami arrival times can be quickly calculated, it is almost always impossible to know whether underwater ground shifts have occurred which will result in tsunami waves. As a result, false alarms can occur with these systems, but the disruption is small, which makes sense due to the highly localised nature of these extremely quick warnings, in combination with how difficult it would be for a false alarm to affect more than a small area of the system. Real tsunamis would affect more than just a small portion.\n\nJapan has a nationwide tsunami warning system. The system usually issues the warning minutes after an Earthquake Early Warning (EEW) is issued, should there be expected waves. The tsunami warning was issued within 3 minutes with the most serious rating on its warning scale during the 2011 Tōhoku earthquake and tsunami; it was rated as a \"major tsunami\", being at least 3 m (9.8 ft) high. An improved system was unveiled on March 7, 2013 following the 2011 disaster to better access the waves.\n\nDetection and prediction of tsunamis is only half the work of the system. Of equal importance is the ability to warn the populations of the areas that will be affected. All tsunami warning systems feature multiple lines of communications (such as SMS, e-mail, fax, radio, texting and telex, often using hardened dedicated systems) enabling emergency messages to be sent to the emergency services and armed forces, as well to population-alerting systems (e.g. sirens) and systems like the Emergency Alert System.\n\nWith the speed at which tsunami waves travel through open water, no system can protect against a very sudden tsunami, where the coast in question is too close to the epicenter. A devastating tsunami occurred off the coast of Hokkaidō in Japan as a result of an earthquake on July 12, 1993. As a result, 202 people on the small island of Okushiri, Hokkaido lost their lives, and hundreds more were missing or injured. This tsunami struck just three to five minutes after the quake, and most victims were caught while fleeing for higher ground and secure places after surviving the earthquake. This was also the case in Aceh, Indonesia.\n\nWhile there remains the potential for sudden devastation from a tsunami, warning systems can be effective. For example, if there were a very large subduction zone earthquake (moment magnitude 9.0) off the west coast of the United States, people in Japan, would therefore have more than 12 hours (and likely warnings from warning systems in Hawaii and elsewhere) before any tsunami arrived, giving them some time to evacuate areas likely to be affected.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "450257", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=450257", "title": "Urban agriculture", "text": "Urban agriculture\n\nUrban agriculture, urban farming, or urban gardening is the practice of cultivating, processing and distributing food in or around urban areas. Urban agriculture can also involve animal husbandry, aquaculture, agroforestry, urban beekeeping, and horticulture. These activities occur in peri-urban areas as well, and peri-urban agriculture may have different characteristics.\nUrban agriculture can reflect varying levels of economic and social development. It may be a social movement for sustainable communities, where organic growers, \"foodies,\" and \"locavores\" form social networks founded on a shared ethos of nature and community holism. These networks can evolve when receiving formal institutional support, becoming integrated into local town planning as a \"transition town\" movement for sustainable urban development. For others, food security, nutrition, and income generation are key motivations for the practice. In either case, more direct access to fresh vegetables, fruits, and meat products through urban agriculture can improve food security and food safety.\n\nIn semi-desert towns of Persia, oases were fed through aqueducts that carried mountain water to support intensive food production, nurtured by wastes from the communities. In Machu Picchu, water was conserved and reused as part of the stepped architecture of the city, and vegetable beds were designed to gather sun in order to prolong the growing season. \n\nIn 1893, citizens of a depression-struck Detroit were asked to use any vacant lots to grow vegetables. They were nicknamed Pingree's Potato Patches after the mayor, Hazen S. Pingree, who came up with the idea. He intended for these gardens to produce income, food supply, and even boost independence during times of hardship. Victory gardens sprouted during WWI and WWII and were fruit, vegetable, and herb gardens in US, Canada, and UK. This effort was undertaken by citizens to reduce pressure on food production that was to support the war effort. \n\nDuring the first World War, President Woodrow Wilson called upon all American citizens to utilize any available open space for food growth, seeing this as a way to pull them out of a potentially damaging situation. Because most of Europe was consumed with war, they were unable to produce sufficient food supplies to be shipped to the U.S., and a new plan was implemented with the intent to feed the U.S. and even supply a surplus to other countries in need. By the year 1919, over 5 million plots were growing food and over 500 million pounds of produce was harvested. \nA very similar practice came into use during the Great Depression that provided a purpose, a job, and food to those who would otherwise be without anything during such harsh times. In this case, these efforts helped to raise spirits socially as well as to boost economic growth. Over 2.8 million dollars worth of food was produced from the subsistence gardens during the Depression. By the time of the Second World War, the War/Food Administration set up a National Victory Garden Program that set out to systematically establish functioning agriculture within cities. With this new plan in action, as many as 5.5 million Americans took part in the victory garden movement and over 9 million pounds of fruit and vegetables were grown a year, accounting for 44% of U.S.-grown produce throughout that time.\n\nCommunity gardening in most communities are open to the public and provide space for citizens to cultivate plants for food or recreation. A community gardening program that is well-established is Seattle's P-Patch. The grassroots permaculture movement has been hugely influential in the renaissance of urban agriculture throughout the world. The Severn Project in Bristol was started in 2010 for £2500 and provides 34 tons of produce per year, employing people from disadvantaged backgrounds.\n\n\"City farms\" are agricultural plots in urban areas, which involve people working with animals and plants to produce food. City farms are usually community-run gardens which aim to improve community relationships and offer an awareness of agriculture and farming to people who live in urbanized areas. City farms are important sources of food security for many communities around the globe. City farms vary in size from small plots in private yards to larger farms that occupy a number of acres. In 1996, a United Nations report estimated there are over 800 million people worldwide who grow food and raise livestock in cities. Although some city farms have paid employees, most rely heavily on volunteer labour, and some are run by volunteers alone. Other city farms operate as partnerships with local authorities.\n\nDuring the 1960s a number of community gardens were established in the United Kingdom, influenced by the community garden movement in the United States. The first city farm was set up in 1972 in Kentish Town, London. It combined farm animals with gardening space, an addition inspired by children's farms in the Netherlands. Other city farms followed across London and the United Kingdom. In Australia, several city farms exist in various capital cities. In Melbourne, the Collingwood Children's Farm was established in 1979 on the Abbotsford Precinct Heritage Farmlands (the APHF), the oldest continually farmed land in Victoria, farmed since 1838.\n\nIn 2010, New York City saw the building and opening of the world's largest privately owned and operated rooftop farm, followed by an even larger location in 2012. Both were a result of municipal programs such as The Green Roof Tax Abatement Program and Green Infrastructure Grant Program.\n\nThe Urban Agriculture Network has defined urban agriculture as:\n[A]n industry that produces, processes, and markets food, fuel, and other outputs, largely \nin response to the daily demand of consumers within a town, city, or metropolis, on many \ntypes of privately and publicly held land and water bodies found throughout intra-urban and \nperi-urban areas. Typically urban agriculture applies intensive production methods, \nfrequently using and reusing natural resources and urban wastes, to yield a diverse array of \nland-, water-, and air-based fauna and flora contributing to the food security, health, \nlivelihood, and environment of the individual, household, and community.\nGlobalization has removed the need and ability of a community's agency in their food production. This results in an inability to address food injustice on a smaller, more manageable scale. This is especially true in cities. Today, most cities have lots of vacant land due to urban sprawl and home foreclosures. This land could be used to address food insecurity. One study of Cleveland shows that city could actually meet up to 100% of its fresh produce need. This would prevent up to $115 million in annual economic leakage. Using the rooftop space of New York City would also be able to provide roughly twice the amount of space necessary to supply New York City with its green vegetable yields. Space could be even better optimized through the usage of hydroponic or indoor factory production of food. Growing gardens within cities would also cut down on the amount of food waste. In order to fund these projects, it would require financial capital in the form of private enterprises or government funding. \nThe Council for Agricultural Science and Technology (CAST) defines urban agriculture to include aspects of environmental health, remediation, and recreation:\nUrban agriculture is a complex system encompassing a spectrum of interests, from a traditional core of activities associated with the production, processing, marketing, distribution, and consumption, to a multiplicity of other benefits and services that are less widely acknowledged and documented. These include recreation and leisure; economic vitality and business entrepreneurship, individual health and well-being; community health and well being; landscape beautification; and environmental restoration and remediation.\nModern planning and design initiatives are often more responsive to this model of urban agriculture because it fits within the current scope of sustainable design. The definition allows for a multitude of interpretations across cultures and time. Frequently it is tied to policy decisions to build sustainable cities.\n\nUrban farms also provide unique opportunities for individuals, especially those living in cities, to get actively involved with ecological citizenship. By reconnecting with food production and nature, urban community gardening teaches individuals the skills necessary to participate in a democratic society. Decisions must be made on a group-level basis in order to run the farm. Most effective results are achieved when residents of a community are asked to take on more active roles in the farm. \n\nAccess to nutritious food, both economically and geographically, is another perspective in the effort to locate food and livestock production in cities. With the tremendous influx of world population to urban areas, the need for fresh and safe food is increased. The Community Food Security Coalition (CFSC) defines food security as:\nAll persons in a community having access to culturally acceptable, nutritionally adequate food through local, non-emergency sources at all times.\nAreas faced with food security issues have limited choices, often relying on highly processed fast food or convenience store foods that are high in calories and low in nutrients, which may lead to elevated rates of diet-related illnesses such as diabetes. These problems have brought about the concept of food justice which Alkon and Norgaard (2009; 289) explain is, \"places access to healthy, affordable, culturally appropriate food in the contexts of institutional racism, racial formation, and racialized geographies... Food justice serves as a theoretical and political bridge between scholarship and activism on sustainable agriculture, food insecurity, and environmental justice.\" \n\nSome systematic reviews have already explored urban agriculture contribution to food security and other determinants of health outcomes (see )\n\nUrban and peri-urban agriculture (UPA) expands the economic base of the city through production, processing, packaging, and marketing of consumable products. This results in an increase in entrepreneurial activities and the creation of jobs, as well as reducing food costs and improving quality. UPA provides employment, income, and access to food for urban populations, which helps to relieve chronic and emergency food insecurity. Chronic food insecurity refers to less affordable food and growing urban poverty, while emergency food insecurity relates to breakdowns in the chain of food distribution. UPA plays an important role in making food more affordable and in providing emergency supplies of food. Research into market values for produce grown in urban gardens has attributed to a community garden plot a median yield value of between approximately $200 and $500 (US, adjusted for inflation).\n\nUrban agriculture can have a large impact on the social and emotional well-being of individuals. UA can have an overall positive impact on community health, which directly impacts individuals social and emotional well-being. Urban gardens are often places that facilitate positive social interaction, which also contributes to overall social and emotional well-being. Many gardens facilitate the improvement of social networks within the communities that they are located. For many neighborhoods, gardens provide a “symbolic focus,” which leads to increased neighborhood pride.\n\nRelated to the previous point, urban agriculture increases community participation through sensibilization and diagnostic workshops or different commissions in the area of vegetable gardens. Activities which involve hundreds of people.\n\nWhen individuals come together around UA, physical activity levels are often increased. Many state that working in agriculture is much more interesting and fulfilling than going to the gym, and that it makes getting exercise “fun.” In addition to the exercise that individuals receive while actually working in gardens, many people say that the majority of the exercise they receive through urban agriculture is actually getting to the gardens—many people either walk or ride their bike to the sites, which provides many physical benefits.\n\nUPA can be seen as a means of improving the livelihood of people living in and around cities. Taking part in such practices is seen mostly as informal activity, but in many cities where inadequate, unreliable, and irregular access to food is a recurring problem, urban agriculture has been a positive response to tackling food concerns. Due to the food security that comes with UA, feelings of independence and empowerment often arise. The ability to produce and grow food for oneself has also been reported to improve levels of self-esteem or of self-efficacy. Households and small communities take advantage of vacant land and contribute not only to their household food needs but also the needs of their resident city. The CFSC states that:\nCommunity and residential gardening, as well as small-scale farming, save household food dollars. They promote nutrition and free cash for non-garden foods and other items. As an example, you can raise your own chickens on an urban farm and have fresh eggs for only $0.44 per dozen.\nThis allows families to generate larger incomes selling to local grocers or to local outdoor markets while supplying their household with the proper nutrition of fresh and nutritional products.\n\nSome community urban farms can be quite efficient and help women find work, who in some cases are marginalized from finding employment in the formal economy. Studies have shown that participation from women have a higher production rate, therefore producing the adequate amount for household consumption while supplying more for market sale.\n\nAs most UA activities are conducted on vacant municipal land, there have been raising concerns about the allocation of land and property rights. The IDRC and the FAO have published the Guidelines for Municipal Policymaking on Urban Agriculture, and are working with municipal governments to create successful policy measures that can be incorporated in urban planning.\n\nOver a third of U.S. households, roughly 42 million, participate in food gardening. There has also been an increase of 63% participation in farming by millennials from 2008-2013. US households participating in community gardening has also tripled from 1 to 3 million in that time frame. Urban agriculture provides unique opportunities to bridge diverse communities together. In addition, it provides opportunities for health care providers to interact with their patients. Thus, making each community garden a hub that is reflective of the community. \n\nThe current industrial agriculture system is accountable for high energy costs for the transportation of foodstuffs. According to a study by Rich Pirog, the associate director of the Leopold Center for Sustainable Agriculture at Iowa State University, the average conventional produce item travels , using, if shipped by tractor-trailer, of fossil fuel per . The energy used to transport food is decreased when urban agriculture can provide cities with locally grown food. Pirog found that traditional, non-local, food distribution system used 4 to 17 times more fuel and emitted 5 to 17 times more than the local and regional transport.\n\nSimilarly, in a study by Marc Xuereb and Region of Waterloo Public Health, they estimated that switching to locally grown food could save transport-related emissions equivalent to nearly 50,000 metric tons of , or the equivalent of taking 16,191 cars off the road.\n\nAs mentioned above, the energy-efficient nature of urban agriculture can reduce each city's carbon footprint by reducing the amount of transport that occurs to deliver goods to the consumer.\n\nAlso, these areas can act as carbon sinks offsetting some of the carbon accumulation that is innate to urban areas, where pavement and buildings outnumber plants. Plants absorb atmospheric carbon dioxide () and release breathable oxygen (O) through photosynthesis. The process of Carbon Sequestration can be further improved by combining other agriculture techniques to increase removal from the atmosphere and prevent the release of during harvest time. However, this process relies heavily on the types of plants selected and the methodology of farming. Specifically, choosing plants that do not lose their leaves and remain green all year can increase the farm's ability to sequester carbon.\n\nThe reduction in ozone and other particulate matter can benefit human health. Reducing these particulates and ozone gases could reduce mortality rates in urban areas along with increase the health of those living in cities. Just to give one example, in the article “Green roofs as a means of pollution abatement,” the author argues that a rooftop containing 2000 m² of uncut grass has the potential to remove up to 4000 kg of particulate matter. According to the article, only one square meter of green roof is needed to offset the annual particulate matter emissions of a car.\n\nVacant urban lots are often victim to illegal dumping of hazardous chemicals and other wastes. They are also liable to accumulate standing water and “grey water”, which can be dangerous to public health, especially left stagnant for long periods. The implementation of urban agriculture in these vacant lots can be a cost-effective method for removing these chemicals. In the process known as Phytoremediation, plants and the associated microorganisms are selected for their chemical ability to degrade, absorb, convert to an inert form, and remove toxins from the soil. Several chemicals can be targeted for removal including heavy metals (e.g. Mercury and lead) inorganic compounds (e.g. Arsenic and Uranium), and organic compounds (e.g. petroleum and chlorinated compounds like PBC's).\n\nPhytoremeditation is both an environmentally friendly, cost-effective, and energy-efficient measure to reduce pollution. Phytoremediation only costs about $5–$40 per ton of soil being decontaminated. Implementation of this process also reduces the amount of soil that must be disposed of in a hazardous waste landfill.\n\nUrban agriculture as a method to mediate chemical pollution can be effective in preventing the spread of these chemicals into the surrounding environment. Other methods of remediation often disturb the soil and force the chemicals contained within it into the air or water. Plants can be used as a method to remove chemicals and also to hold the soil and prevent erosion of contaminated soil decreasing the spread of pollutants and the hazard presented by these lots.\n\nOne way of identifying soil contamination is through using already well-established plants as bioindicators of soil health. Using well-studied plants is important because there has already been substantial bodies of work to test them in various conditions, so responses can be verified with certainty. Such plants are also valuable because they are genetically identical as crops as opposed to natural variants of the same species. Typically urban soil has had the topsoil stripped away and has led to soil with low aeration, porosity, and drainage. Typical measures of soil health are microbial biomass and activity, enzymes, soil organic matter (SOM), total nitrogen, available nutrients, porosity, aggregate stability, and compaction. A new measurement is active carbon (AC), which is the most usable portoin of the total organic carbon (TOC) in the soil. This contributes greatly to the functionality of the soil food web. Using common crops, which are generally well-studied, as bioindicators an be used to effectively test the quality of an urban farming plot before beginning planting. \n\nLarge amounts of noise pollution not only lead to lower property values and high frustration, they can be damaging to human hearing and health. In the study “Noise exposure and public health,” they argue that exposure to continual noise is a public health problem. They cite examples of the detriment of continual noise on humans to include: “hearing impairment, hypertension and ischemic heart disease, annoyance, sleep disturbance, and decreased school performance.” Since most roofs or vacant lots consist of hard flat surfaces that reflect sound waves instead of absorbing them, adding plants that can absorb these waves has the potential to lead to a vast reduction in noise pollution.\n\nDaily intake of a variety of fruits and vegetables is linked to a decreased risk of chronic diseases including diabetes, heart disease, and cancer. Urban agriculture is associated with increased consumption of fruits and vegetables which decreases risk for disease and can be a cost-effective way to provide citizens with quality, fresh produce in urban settings.\n\nUrban agriculture also provides quality nutrition for low-income households. Studies show that every $1 invested in a community garden yields $6 worth of vegetables if labor is not considered a factor in investment. Many urban gardens reduce the strain on food banks and other emergency food providers by donating shares of their harvest and provide fresh produce in areas that otherwise might be food deserts. The supplemental nutrition program Women, Infants and Children (WIC) as well as the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) have partnered with several urban gardens nationwide to improve the accessibility to produce in exchange for a few hours of volunteer gardening work.\n\nUrban farming has been shown to increase health outcomes. Gardeners consume twice as much fruit and vegetables than non-gardeners. Levels of physical activity are also positively associated with urban farming. These results are seen indirectly and can be supported by the social involvement in an individual's community as a member of the community farm. This social involvement helped raised the aesthetic appeal of the neighborhood, boosting the motivation or efficacy of the community as a whole. This increased efficacy was shown to increase neighborhood attachment. Therefore, the positive health outcomes of urban farming can be explained in part due to the interpersonal sand social factors that boost health. Focusing on improving the aesthetics and community relationships and not only on the plant yield, is the best way to maximize the positive effect of urban farms on a neighborhood. \n\nUsing high-density urban farming, as for instance with vertical farms or stacked greenhouses, many environmental benefits can be achieved on a citywide scale that would be impossible otherwise. These systems do not only provide food, but also produce potable water from waste water, and can recycle organic waste back to energy and nutrients. At the same time, they can reduce food-related transportation to a minimum while providing fresh food for large communities in almost any climate.\n\nA 2009 report by the USDA, determined that \"Evidence is both abundant and robust enough for us to conclude that Americans living in low-income and minority areas tend to have poor access to healthy food\", and that the \"structural inequalities\" in these neighborhoods \"contribute to inequalities in diet and diet-related outcomes\". These diet-related outcomes, including obesity and diabetes, have become epidemic in low-income urban environments in the United States. Although the definition and methods for determining \"food deserts\" have varied, studies indicate that, at least in the United States, there are racial disparities in the food environment. Thus using the definition of environment as the place where people live, work, play and pray, food disparities become an issue of environmental justice. This is especially true in American inner-cities where a history of racist practices have contributed to the development of food deserts in the low-income, minority areas of the urban core. The issue of inequality is so integral to the issues of food access and health that the Growing Food & Justice for All Initiative was founded with the mission of “dismantling racism” as an integral part of creating food security.\n\nNot only can urban agriculture provide healthy, fresh food options, but also can contribute to a sense of community, aesthetic improvement, crime reduction, minority empowerment and autonomy, and even preserve culture through the use of farming methods and heirloom seeds preserved from areas of origin.\n\nUrban agriculture may advance environmental justice and food justice for communities living in food deserts. First, urban agriculture may reduce racial and class disparities in access to healthy food. When urban agriculture leads to locally grown fresh produce sold at affordable prices in food deserts, access to healthy food is not just available for those who live in wealthy areas, thereby leading to greater equity in rich and poor neighborhoods.\nImproved access to food through urban agriculture can also help alleviate psychosocial stresses in poor communities. Community members engaged in urban agriculture improve local knowledge about healthy ways to fulfill dietary needs. Urban agriculture can also better the mental health of community members. Buying and selling quality products to local producers and consumers allows community members to support one another, which may reduce stress. Thus, urban agriculture can help improve conditions in poor communities, where residents experience higher levels of stress due to a perceived lack of control over the quality of their lives.\nUrban agriculture may improve the livability and built environment in communities that lack supermarkets and other infrastructure due to the presence of high unemployment caused by deindustrialization. Urban farmers who follow sustainable agriculture methods can not only help to build local food system infrastructure, but can also contribute to improving local air, and water and soil quality. When agricultural products are produced locally within the community, they do not need to be transported, which reduces emission rates and other pollutants that contribute to high rates of asthma in lower socioeconomic areas. Sustainable urban agriculture can also promote worker protection and consumer rights. For example, communities in New York City, Illinois, and Richmond, Virginia have demonstrated improvements to their local environments through urban agricultural practices.\nHowever, urban agriculture can also present urban growers with health risks if the soil used for urban farming is contaminated. Although local produce is often believed to be clean and healthy, many urban farmers ranging from New York urban farmer Frank Meushke to Presidential First Lady Michelle Obama have found their products contained high levels of lead, due to soil contamination, which is harmful to human health when consumed. The soil contaminated with high lead levels often originates from old house paint which contained lead, vehicle exhaust, or atmospheric deposition. Without proper education on the risks of urban farming and safe practices, urban consumers of urban agricultural produce may face additional health-related issues\n\nCreating a community-based infrastructure for urban agriculture means establishing local systems to grow and process food and transfer it from farmer (producer) to consumer.\n\nTo facilitate food production, cities have established community-based farming projects. Some projects have collectively tended community farms on common land, much like that of eighteenth-century Boston Common. One such community farm is the Collingwood Children's Farm in Melbourne, Australia. Other community garden projects use the allotment garden model, in which gardeners care for individual plots in a larger gardening area, often sharing a tool shed and other amenities. Seattle's P-Patch gardens use this model, as did the South Central Farm in Los Angeles and the Food Roof Farm in St. Louis. Independent urban gardeners also grow food in individual yards and on roofs. Garden sharing projects seek to pair producers with the land, typically, residential yard space. Roof gardens allow for urban dwellers to maintain green spaces in the city without having to set aside a tract of undeveloped land. Rooftop farms allow otherwise unused industrial roofspace to be used productively, creating work and profit. Projects around the world seek to enable cities to become 'continuous productive landscapes' by cultivating vacant urban land and temporary or permanent kitchen gardens.\nFood processing on a community level has been accommodated by centralizing resources in community tool sheds and processing facilities for farmers to share. The Garden Resource Program Collaborative based in Detroit has cluster tool banks. Different areas of the city have tool banks where resources like tools, compost, mulch, tomato stakes, seeds, and education can be shared and distributed with the gardeners in that cluster. Detroit's Garden Resource Program Collaborative also strengthens their gardening community by providing to their member's transplants; education on gardening, policy, and food issues; and by building connectivity between gardeners through workgroups, potlucks, tours, field trips, and cluster workdays. In Brazil, \"Cities Without Hunger\" has generated a public policy for the reconstruction of abandoned areas with food production and has improved the green areas of the community.\n\nFarmers' markets, such as the farmers' market in Los Angeles, provide a common land where farmers can sell their product to consumers. Large cities tend to open their farmer's markets on the weekends and one day in the middle of the week. For example, the farmers' market of Boulevard Richard-Lenoir in Paris, France, is open on Sundays and Thursdays. However, to create a consumer dependency on urban agriculture and to introduce local food production as a sustainable career for farmers, markets would have to be open regularly. For example, the Los Angeles Farmers' Market is open seven days a week and has linked several local grocers together to provide different food products. The market's central location in downtown Los Angeles provides the perfect interaction for a diverse group of sellers to access their consumers.\n\nIn Queensland many people have started a trend of urban farming both utilizing Aquaponics and self-watering containers.\n\nIn Egypt, development of rooftop gardens began in the 1990s. In the early 1990s at Ain Shams University, a group of agriculture professors developed an initiative focused on growing organic vegetables to suit densely populated cities of Egypt. The initiative was applied on a small scale; until it was officially adopted in 2001, by the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO).\n\nAfter the disintegration of the Soviet Union and the Eastern Bloc, Cuba faced severe shortages of fuel and agrochemical inputs. These products had previously been imported from the Soviet Union in exchange for Cuban sugar. As a result, Cubans experienced an acute food crisis in the early 1990s, which in part was met with a popular movement of urban agriculture. Urban farmers employed – and still employ –\nagroecological techniques, allowing food production to take place largely without petroleum-based inputs.\n\nIn 2002, of urban gardens produced of food. In Havana, 90% of the city's fresh produce come from local urban farms and gardens. In 2003, more than 200,000 Cubans worked in the expanding urban agriculture sector.\n\nEconomic development in Mumbai brought a growth in population caused mainly by the migration of laborers from other regions of the country. The number of residents in the city increased more than twelve times in the last century. Greater Mumbai, formed by City Island and Salsette Island, is the largest city in India with a population of 16.4 million, according to data collected by the census of 2001. Mumbai is one of the densest cities in the world, 48,215 persons per km² and 16,082 per km² in suburban areas. In this scenario, urban agriculture seems unlikely to be put into practice since it must compete with real estate developers for the access and use of vacant lots. Alternative farming methods have emerged as a response to the scarcity of land, water, and economic resources employed in UPA.\n\nDr. Doshi's city garden methods are revolutionary for being appropriate to apply in reduced spaces as terraces and balconies, even on civil construction walls, and for not requiring big investments in capital or long hours of work. His farming practice is purely organic and is mainly directed to domestic consumption. His gardening tools are composed of materials available in the local environment: sugarcane waste, polyethylene bags, tires, containers and cylinders, and soil. The containers and bags (open at both ends) are filled with the sugarcane stalks, compost, and garden soil, which make possible the use of a minimal quantity of water is compared to open fields. Dr. Doshi states that solar energy can replace soil in cities. He also recommends the idea of chain planning, or growing plants in intervals and in small quantities rather than at once and in large amounts. He has grown different types of fruit such as mangos, figs, guavas, bananas, and sugarcane stalks in his terrace of in Bandra. The concept of city farming developed by Dr. Doshi consumes the entire household's organic waste. He subsequently makes the household self-sufficient in the provision of food: of fruits and vegetables are produced daily for 300 days a year.\n\nThe main objectives of a pilot project at city farm at Rosary High School, Dockyard Road, were to promote economic support for street children, beautify the city landscape, supply locally produced organic food to urban dwellers (mainly those residing in slums), and to manage organic waste in a sustainable city. The project was conducted in the Rosary School, in Mumbai, with the participation of street children during 2004. A city farm was created in a terrace area of . The participants were trained in urban farming techniques. The farm produced vegetables, fruits, and flowers. The idea has spread the concept of city farm to other schools in the city.\n\nThe Mumbai Port Trust (MBPT) central kitchen distributes food to approximately 3,000 employees daily, generating important amounts of organic disposal. A terrace garden created by the staff recycles ninety percent of this waste in the production of vegetables and fruits. Preeti Patil, who is the catering officer at the MBPT explains the purpose of the enterprise:\nMumbai Port Trust has developed an organic farm on the terrace of its central kitchen, which is an area of approximately . The activity of city farming was started initially to dispose of kitchen organic waste in an eco-friendly way. Staff members, after their daily work in the kitchen, tend the garden, which has about 150 plants.\nIn early 2000, urban gardens were started under the direction of the NGO, Thailand Environment Institute (TEI), to help achieve the Bangkok Metropolitan Administrations (BMA) priority to \"green\" Thailand. With a population of 12 million and 39% of the land in the city vacant due to rapid expansion of the 1960s–80s Bangkok is a test bed for urban gardens centered on community involvement. The two urban gardens initiated by TEI are in Bangkok Noi and Bangkapi and the main tasks were stated as:\n\nWhile the goals of the NGO are important in a global context, the community goals are being met through the work of forming the urban gardens themselves. In this sense, the creation, implementation, and maintenance of urban gardens are highly determined by the desires of the communities involved. However, the criteria by which TEI measured their success illustrates the scope of benefits to a community which practices urban agriculture. TEI's success indicators were:\n\nBeijing's increase in land area from in 1956 to in 1958 led to the increased adoption of peri-urban agriculture. Such \"suburban agriculture\" led to more than 70% of non-staple food in Beijing, mainly consisting of vegetables and milk, to be produced by the city itself in the 1960s and 1970s. Recently, with relative food security in China, periurban agriculture has led to improvements in the quality of the food available, as opposed to quantity. One of the more recent experiments in urban agriculture is the Modern Agricultural Science Demonstration Park in Xiaotangshan.\n\nTraditionally, Chinese cities have been known to mix agricultural activities within the urban setting. Shenzhen, once a small farming community, is now a fast-growing metropolis due to the Chinese government designation as an open economic zone. Due to large and growing population in China, the government supports urban self-sufficiency in food production. Shenzhen's village structure, sustainable methods, and new agricultural advancements initiated by the government have been strategically configured to supply food for this growing city.\n\nThe city farms are located about from the city center in a two-tier system. The first tier approached from city center produces perishable items. Located just outside these farms, hardier vegetables are grown such as potatoes, carrots, and onions. This system allows producers to be sold in city markets just a few short hours after picking.\n\nAnother impressive method used in Chinese agriculture and aquaculture practice is the mulberry-dike fish-pond system, which is a response to waste recycling and soil fertility. This system can be described as:\nMulberry trees are grown to feed silkworms and the silkworm waste is fed to the fish in ponds. The fish also feed on waste from other animals, such as pigs, poultry, and buffalo. The animals, in turn, are given crops that have been fertilized by mud from the ponds. This is a sophisticated system as a continuous cycle of water, waste, and food...with a man built into the picture.\nAs the population grows and industry advances, the city tries to incorporate potential agricultural growth by experimenting with new agricultural methods. The Fong Lau Chee Experimental Farm in Dongguan, Guangdong has worked with new agricultural advancements in lychee production. This farm was established with aspirations of producing large quantities and high-quality lychees, by constantly monitoring sugar content, and their seeds. This research, conducted by local agricultural universities allows for new methods to be used with hopes of reaching the needs of city consumers.\n\nHowever, due to increased levels of economic growth and pollution, some urban farms have become threatened. The government has been trying to step in and create new technological advancements within the agricultural field to sustain levels of urban agriculture.\n\n\"The city plans to invest 8.82 billion yuan in 39 agricultural projects, including a safe agricultural base, an agricultural high-tech park, agricultural processing and distribution, forestry, eco-agricultural tourism, which will form an urban agriculture with typical Shenzhen characteristics\" in conjunction with this program the city is expected to expand the Buji Farm Produce Wholesale Market.\n\nAccording to the Municipal Bureau of Agriculture, Forestry and Fishery the city will invest 600 million yuan on farms located around the city, with hopes of the farms to provide \"60 percent of the meat, vegetables, and aquatic products in the Shenzhen market\".\n\nThere has also been an emerging trend of going green and organic as a response to pollution and pesticides used in farming practices. Vegetable suppliers are required to pass certain inspections held by the city's Agriculture Bureau before they can be sold as \"green\".\n\nHarare is particularly suited for urban agriculture, as its topography heavily features \"vleis\", land drainage systems that become waterlogged in the rainy season. When it rains they are difficult to cross, and in the dry season they shrink and crack, which causes structural damage to infrastructure, even though the vleis are still storing water underground. Therefore, these moisture-rich areas are mostly left unbuilt, allowing for urban cultivation.\n\nAside from vleis and the private residential land that Harareans cultivate, considerable public land is used for agriculture in Harare: along public roads, railway lines, undeveloped plots, road verges, and the banks of ditches. The land is mostly used for maize, groundnuts, sweet potatoes, green vegetables, fruits, paprika, and flowers.This unsanctioned cultivation has a history of necessity: in colonial times, laborers wanted towns where they could cultivate crops like at their rural homes, and with very low income, needed to supplement their food supply.\n\nHowever, urban agriculture in Harare causes harm to the environment. The practice has reduced rainwater infiltration into the soil by 28.5 percent and lowered tree species diversity. In addition, most informal urban farmers use harmful chemical fertilizers. Urban agriculture has also been viewed negatively in Harare because it impedes on housing and urban development. In the eyes of Zimbabwean laws, agriculture was not an “urban” activity or a legitimate form of land use in cities. In 1983, the Greater Harare Illegal Cultivation Committee was formed, though its efforts to curb urban agriculture wholly failed.\n\nIn the 1990s, the failure of Structural Adjustment Programs induced greater unemployment, higher prices, and lower incomes, so more people started growing their own food. Between 1990 and 1994, Harare's cultivation area increased by 92.6 percent. The boom in urban agriculture improved both the food security and the nutrition of its practitioners, as well as additional income from selling excess produce. The practice continued in the 2000s when a major recession brought about widespread poverty, unemployment, and enormous inflation. Finally, the 2002 Nyanga Declaration on Urban Agriculture in Zimbabwe explicitly acknowledged the value of urban agriculture for food security and the reduction of poverty. Accepting that many people depend on it to survive, the government allocated sixty thousand hectares of land in Harare for cultivation purposes.\n\nAccording to the USDA, a farm is defined as a location that produces and sells at least $1,000 worth of products. A study conducted on urban farms in 2012 surveyed over 315 farms that identified as urban. Of those, over 32% were found in the Northeast, more than 26% in the South, 22% in the West, and less than 19% in the Midwest. The survey found that most urban farms in the United States are structured as either non-profit or solely owned. Urban farms typically use techniques that allow them to produce intensively on small land. Mainly, these practices include raised beds, greenhouse, and container gardens. Of the products made, an overwhelming majority of urban farms focus on fresh vegetable, followed by herbs and flowers. If an urban farm focuses on animals, the primary animal is hens. Bees and sheep are the second most common urban farm animals.\n\nAlmost half of the urban farms that participated in the survey made a total gross sale adding to less than $10,000. The majority of these sales coming from farmers markets, Community Supported Agriculture (CSA), and restaurants. Not even 5% of the urban farms could be considered according to total gross sales statistics. Most urban farms agree on the main challenges that they face; production costs, managing pests, managing weeds, and climate. They also see profitability, financing, and farm labor as big challenges of managing an urban farm.\n\n Many low-income residents suffer from high rates of obesity and diabetes and limited sources of fresh produce. The City and local nonprofit groups have been providing land, training and financial encouragement, but the impetus in urban farming has really come from the farmers, who often volunteer when their regular work day is done. In addition, the New York City Department of Environmental Protection offers a grant program for private property owners in combined sewer areas of New York City. The minimum requirement is to manage 1” of stormwater runoff from the contributing impervious area. Eligible projects include green roofs, rooftop farms, and rainwater harvesting on private property in combined sewer areas. Because of this grant program, New York City now has the world's largest rooftop farms.\n\nSome urban gardeners have used empty lots to start a community or urban gardens. However, the soil must be tested for heavy contamination in city soil because of vehicle exhaust and remnants of old construction. The City also has a composting program, which is available to gardeners and farmers. One group, GreenThumb, provides free seedlings. Another program, the City Farms project operated by the nonprofit Just Food, offers courses on growing and selling food.\n\nTwo alternate means of growing are rooftop gardens and hydroponic (soil-less) growing. \"The New York Times\" wrote an article about one of Manhattan's first gardens which incorporate both these techniques. Another option urban gardeners have used is Farm-in-A-Box LLC, a company that provides hand-made, ready-to-use garden boxes to residents and schools.\n\nIn response to the recession of 2008, a coalition of community-based organizations, farmers, and academic institutions in California's Pomona Valley formed the Pomona Valley Urban Agriculture Initiative.\n\nAfter the passage of the North American Free Trade Agreement, cheap grain from the United States flooded Mexico, driving peasant farmers off of their land. Many immigrated to the Pomona Valley and found work in the construction industry. With the 2008 recession, the construction industry also suffered in the region. It is unlikely to regain its former strength because of severe water shortages in this desert region as well as ongoing weakness in the local economy. These immigrants were dry land organic farmers in their home country by default since they did not have access to pesticides and petroleum-based fertilizers. Now, they found themselves on the border of two counties: Los Angeles County with a population of 10 million and almost no farmland, and San Bernardino County which has the worst access to healthy food in the state. In both counties, there is a growing demand for locally grown organic produce. In response to these conditions, Uncommon Good, a community-based nonprofit organization that works with immigrant farmer families, convened a forum which became the Urban Farmers Association. The Urban Farmers Association is the first organization of its kind for poor immigrant farmers in the Pomona Valley. Its goal is to develop opportunities for its members to support themselves and their families through urban agriculture. With Uncommon Good, it is a founding member of the Pomona Valley Urban Agriculture Initiative (PVUAI). The PVUAI is working with local colleges and universities to expand upon a food assessment survey that was done in the City of Pomona.\n\nUrban agriculture in West Oakland has taken a radical form that can be traced back to community gardening initiatives starting in the 1970s in the cities of Berkeley and Oakland, and the city's African-American heritage. Oakland's manufacturing industry attracted new residents during WWII. To reduce racial tension, the Oakland Housing Authority established housing projects for blacks in West Oakland and whites in East Oakland. With exclusionary covenants and redlining by banks, development capital was kept out of West Oakland while the African-American population had limited opportunities to rent or buy housing outside West Oakland.\n\nThe Black Panther Party (BPP) played a role in seeding urban agricultural practices in West Oakland. One of its social programs aimed to improve the access to healthy food for the city's black population by providing breakfast in local schools, churches, and community centers. A small amount of this food came from small local gardens planted by BPP members. According to Prof. Nathan McClintock, \"The Panthers used gardening as a coping mechanism and a means of supplementing their diets, as a well as a means to strengthen community members engaged in the struggle against oppression.\" The People of Color Greening Network (PCGN) was created in the 1990s. The group planted in empty and vacant lots in West Oakland. In addition, schools around Alameda County began teaching basic gardening skills and food education. Other groups have carried on those legacies, such as People's Grocery and Planting Justice.\n\nIn 1998, the city of Oakland's Mayor's Office of Sustainability proposed a Sustainable Community Development Initiative towards sustainable development. Due to West Oakland's lack of access to nutritious and healthy food, other organizations including the PCGN and City Slicker Farms demanded the plan include strategies for creating a sustainable impact on the local food system. City Slicker Farms was founded in 2001 in response to the lack of access to fresh produce in West Oakland. Through land donations from local residents, a network of urban farms was created through the Community Market Farms Program, and in 2005 the organization established the Backyard Garden Program to aid West Oakland residents in growing their own food at home. This program now grows upwards of 30,000  lbs. of food each year.\n\nIn 2005, Mayor Jerry Brown signed the UN World Environment Day Urban Environmental Accords, pledging Oakland to become a more sustainable city by the year 2012. This gave rise to Oakland City Council Resolutions, such as No. 76980 and No. 80332 which helped develop a Food Policy Council. It has teamed up with the Health of Oakland's People & Environment (HOPE) Collaborative, which works to improve the health and wellness of Oakland's residents. In 2009 the Oakland Food Policy Council started to plan urban agriculture in Oakland.\n\nCanada has a number of companies working on urban farm technology, including Lufa Farms. In Montreal, there are 97 community gardens which allow citizens space in each plot to grow their plants. The program has been in place since 1975 and is managed by the boroughs. Of the eighteen boroughs, some have a gardening instructor who visits the gardens regularly to give gardeners tips. The soil, a water supply, a space for tools, sand, fencing, and paint are all provided by the city.\n\nNow you can find about 100 community gardens in Montreal and they have very extensive, well-established, city run community gardening programs. This gardening program is run by the Department of Sports, Recreation and Social Development which provides the garden with the necessities needed for it to run, such as water, maintenance and others. The largest community garden has about 255 allotment plots while the smallest community garden has about 25 plots. 2/3 of the community gardens can be found in parkland zones, which will help prevent development problems in the long run. Out of 2 million people living in the urbanized parts of Montreal, about 10000 of these residents share the garden plots.\n\nOn July 19, 2017, an IGA (supermarkets) located in Saint-Laurent in Montreal unveiled their largest supermarket green roof to have opened in Canada. They are currently the only grocery store that sells organic produce on their roof. With about 25000 square feet of green space and products certified by Ecocert Canada, they can sell over 30 different kinds of fresh, organic produce. Along with growing vegetables, they are also selling honey produced and harvested by eight Alvéole bee hives which have also made the green roof their home.\n\nA Canadian urban farmer in British Columbia has published details on a crop value rating (CVR) system that urban farmers can use to determine which crops to grow, based on each crop's contribution to supporting the farm economically. This entails forgoing some crops in favor of others, but he points out that urban farmers can develop business networking with rural farmers to bring some of those other crops to the urban point of sale. For example, the urban farmer may not be able to economically justify growing sweet corn (based on long days to maturity and low yield density per linear foot of row), but a networking arrangement is mutually beneficial, as it lets a rural sweet corn grower gain an additional point of sale at retail price while also letting the urban farmer fill the gap in his product line offering.\n\nSeveral community projects in Victoria, British Columbia were born to promote urban agricultural practices such as the Sharing Backyards program. This program exists to help people living in urban areas get connected with others who have extra space in their yards for the purpose of urban farming. Organizations also exist to educate people living in the urban parts of Vancouver on farming and growing food in an urban setting by running public demonstration gardens.\n\nCovering the roof of the west building of the Vancouver Convention Centre is the largest green roof in Canada and one of the 10 largest green roofs in the world. With around six acres of living space, it is home to more than 400,000 indigenous plants and grasses that provide insulation. It is also home to four Western honey bee beehives which pollinate the plants on the roof and provide honey. The living includes other sustainable practices such as recycling and reusing water.\n\nThe city of Kamloops, in British Columbia, are actively promoting urban agricultural practices within their community. They stress on the importance of food security and its affect on the economy as well as the ecology. They created the Food and Urban Agriculture Plan (FUAP), initiated in 2014, which lays out goals and strategies to implement a sustainable food system. The Areas which they cover include: Food Production and Land Availability, Food Processing and Preparing, Food Distribution/Retail/Access, Cooking/Eating and Celebrating Food, Food Waste and Resource Management, as well as Education/Governance and Capacity Building. The FUAP greatly emphasizes on Urban Agriculture.\n\nOntario is the second biggest province and has one of the most urbanized cities in Canada, Toronto. The provincial government of Ontario has a website dedicated to providing information to those who are interested in establishing an urban farm or for those who just want to learn more about urban agriculture in Ontario.\n\nUrbanHensTo is a 3-year pilot program that launched in the City of Toronto on March 2, 2018. This program allows eligible resident in 4 wards across the city to keep a maximum of 4 hens (no roosters) for the purpose of enjoyment or personal consumption of only the eggs. There are other requirements included with rearing these hens under this program such as zoning and guidelines for building the enclosure, waste and disposal. The wards eligible for this program from the UrbanHensTo site include:\nWorkshops are also available to those interested in rearing urban hens. However, failure to abide by these rules and regulations can result in fines.\n\nToronto has a green roof policy and bylaw which has promoted the practice of installing green roofs. According to the Green Roof Industry Survey in 2016, the city was recognized as having the most green roofs installed on buildings in all of North America. This came to be after they developed a green roof strategy in 2009 where new development buildings are required to install a green roof. \n\nTodmorden is a town of 17,000 inhabitants in Yorkshire, United Kingdom with a successful urban agriculture model. The project, which began in 2008, has meant that food crops have been planted at forty locations throughout the town. The produce is all free, the work is done by volunteers, and passers-by and visitors are invited to pick and use the produce., Some Todmorden plots have been permission plots while others have been examples of guerilla gardening. All are \"propaganda gardens\" promoting locals to consider growing local, to eat seasonal, to consider the provenance of their food, and to enjoy fresh. There are food plots in the street, in the health center car park, at the rail station, in the police station, in the cemetery, and in all the town's schools.\n\nThe city of Rosario (population: 1.3 million) has incorporated agriculture fully into its land use planning and urban development strategy. Its Land Use Plan 2007-2017 makes specific provision for the agricultural use of public land. Under its Metropolitan Strategic Plan 2008-2018, Rosario is building a “green circuit”, passing through and around the city, consisting of family and community gardens, large-scale, commercial vegetable gardens and orchards, multifunctional garden parks, and “productive barrios”, where agriculture is integrated into programmes for the construction of public housing and the upgrading of slums. In 2014, the green circuit consisted of more than 30 ha of land used to grow vegetables, fruit and medicinal and aromatic plants. The city has five garden parks – large, landscaped green areas covering a total of 72 ha of land, which are used for agriculture and for cultural, sports and educational activities.\n\nThe benefits that UPA brings along to cities that implement this practice are numerous. The transformation of cities from only consumers of food to generators of agricultural products contributes to sustainability, improved health, and poverty alleviation.\n\nPoverty alleviation: It is known that a large part of the people involved in urban agriculture is the urban poor. In developing countries, the majority of urban agricultural production is for self-consumption, with surpluses being sold in the market. According to the FAO (Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations), urban poor consumers spend between 60 and 80 percent of their income on food, making them very vulnerable to higher food prices.\n\nCommunity centers and gardens educate the community to see agriculture as an integral part of urban life. The Florida House Institute for Sustainable Development in Sarasota, Florida, serves as a public community and education center in which innovators with sustainable, energy-saving ideas can implement and test them. Community centers like Florida House provide urban areas with a central location to learn about urban agriculture and to begin to integrate agriculture with the urban lifestyle.\n\nUrban farms also are a proven effective educational tool to teach kids about healthy eating and meaningful physical activity.\n\n\nMunicipal greening policy goals can pose conflicts. For example, policies promoting urban tree canopy are not sympathetic to vegetable gardening because of the deep shade cast by trees. However, some municipalities like Portland, Oregon, and Davenport, Iowa are encouraging the implementation of fruit-bearing trees (as street trees or as park orchards) to meet both greening and food production goals.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "37125312", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=37125312", "title": "Vetocracy", "text": "Vetocracy\n\nA vetocracy refers to a dysfunctional system of governance whereby no single entity can acquire enough power to make decisions and take effective charge. The term points to an excessive ability or willingness to use the veto power within a government or institution (without an adequate means of any override). Such limitations may point to a lack of trust among members or hesitance to cede sovereignty.\n\nSome institutions which have been hampered by perceptions of vetocratic limitations (and even responsible for their downfall) include the Articles of Confederation, the Confederate States of America, and the League of Nations. The present-day United Nations Security Council is criticized for its inability to take decisive action due to the exclusive rights of veto power of permanent members. Thomas Friedman and Moisés Naím also used the term to describe the argument of Francis Fukuyama that the United States was facing such a crisis.\n\nVetocracy in social settings is formally equivalent to the principle of falsifiability in science, whereby a single objecting observation can falsify a proposition. Agreements under vetocracy are achieved, when consensus is reached, and none of the parties within a vetocratic system are left unsatisfied.\n"}

In the field of food science, the standard state is most often defined as the partial vapor pressure of pure water at the same temperature. Using this particular definition, pure distilled water has a water activity of exactly one. As temperature increases, a typically increases, except in some products with crystalline salt or sugar.\n\nHigher a substances tend to support more microorganisms. Bacteria usually require at least 0.91, and fungi at least 0.7. See also fermentation.\n\nWater migrates from areas of high a to areas of low a. For example, if honey (a ≈ 0.6) is exposed to humid air (a ≈ 0.7), the honey absorbs water from the air. If salami (a ≈ 0.87) is exposed to dry air (a ≈ 0.5), the salami dries out, which could preserve it or spoil it.\n\nDefinition of a:\nwhere \"p\" is the partial vapor pressure of water in the solution, and \"p*₀\" is the partial vapor pressure of pure water at the same temperature.\n\nAlternate definition:\nwhere \"l\" is the activity coefficient of water and \"x\" is the mole fraction of water in the aqueous fraction.\n\nRelationship to relative humidity:\nThe relative humidity of air in equilibrium with a sample is called the Equilibrium Relative Humidity (ERH).\n\nEstimated mold-free shelf life in days at 21° C:\n\nWater activity is an important consideration for food product design and food safety.\n\nFood designers use water activity to formulate shelf-stable food. If a product is kept below a certain water activity, then mold growth is inhibited. This results in a longer shelf life.\n\nWater activity values can also help limit moisture migration within a food product made with different ingredients. If raisins of a higher water activity are packaged with bran flakes of a lower water activity, the water from the raisins migrates to the bran flakes over time, making the raisins hard and the bran flakes soggy. Food formulators use water activity to predict how much moisture migration affects their product.\n\nWater activity is used in many cases as a critical control point for Hazard Analysis and Critical Control Points (HACCP) programs. Samples of the food product are periodically taken from the production area and tested to ensure water activity values are within a specified range for food quality and safety. Measurements can be made in as little as five minutes, and are made regularly in most major food production facilities.\n\nFor many years, researchers tried to equate bacterial growth potential with water content. They found that the values were not universal, but specific to each food product. W. J. Scott first established that bacterial growth correlated with water activity, not water content, in 1953. It is firmly established that growth of bacteria is inhibited at specific water activity values. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) regulations for intermediate moisture foods are based on these values.\n\nLowering the water activity of a food product should not be seen as a kill step. Studies in powdered milk show that viable cells can exist at much lower water activity values, but that they never grow. Over time, bacterial levels decline.\n\nWater activity values are obtained by either a resistive electrolytic, a capacitance or a dew point hygrometer.\n\nResistive electrolytic hygrometers use a sensing element in the form of a liquid electrolyte held in between of two small glass rods by capillary force. The electrolyte changes resistance if it absorbs or loses water vapor. The resistance is directly proportional to relative air humidity, and also to water activity of the sample (once vapor–liquid equilibrium is established). This relation can be checked by either a verification or calibration using salt-water mixtures, which provide a well-defined and reproducible air humidity in the measurement chamber.\n\nThe sensor does not have any physically given hysteresis as it is known from capacitance hygrometers and sensors, and does not require regular cleaning as its surface is not the effectively sensing element. Volatiles, in principle, influence the measurement performance—especially those that dissociate in the electrolyte and thereby change its resistance. Such influences can easily be avoided by using chemical protection filters that absorb the volatile compound before arriving at the sensor.\n\nCapacitance hygrometers consist of two charged plates separated by a polymer membrane dielectric. As the membrane adsorbs water, its ability to hold a charge increases and the capacitance is measured. This value is roughly proportional to the water activity as determined by a sensor-specific calibration.\n\nCapacitance hygrometers are not affected by most volatile chemicals and can be much smaller than other alternative sensors. They do not require cleaning, but are less accurate than dew point hygrometers (+/- 0.015 a). They should have regular calibration checks and can be affected by residual water in the polymer membrane (hysteresis).\n\nThe temperature at which dew forms on a clean surface is directly related to the vapor pressure of the air. Dew point hygrometers work by placing a mirror over a closed sample chamber. The mirror is cooled until the dew point temperature is measured by means of an optical sensor. This temperature is then used to find the relative humidity of the chamber using psychrometrics charts.\n\nThis method is theoretically the most accurate (+/- 0.003 a) and often the fastest. The sensor requires cleaning if debris accumulates on the mirror.\n\nWith either method, vapor–liquid equilibrium must occur in the sample chamber. This takes place over time or can be aided by the addition of a fan in the chamber. Thermal equilibrium must also take place unless the sample temperature is measured.\n\nWater activity is related to water content in a non-linear relationship known as a moisture sorption isotherm curve. These isotherms are substance- and temperature-specific. Isotherms can be used to help predict product stability over time in different storage conditions.\n\nThere is net evaporation from a solution with a water activity greater than the relative humidity of its surroundings. There is net absorption of water by a solution with a water activity less than the relative humidity of its surroundings. Therefore, in an enclosed space, a solution can be used to regulate humidity.\n\n\n"}

It was organised by the British and Foreign Anti-Slavery Society, largely on the initiative of the English Quaker Joseph Sturge. The exclusion of women from the convention had important ramifications for the women's suffrage movement in the United States.\n\nThe Society for the Abolition of the Slave Trade was principally a Quaker society founded in the eighteenth century by Thomas Clarkson. The slave trade had been abolished throughout the British Empire in 1807. In August 1833 the British government passed the Slavery Abolition Act, advocated by William Wilberforce, which abolished slavery in the British Empire from August 1834, when some 800,000 people in the British empire became free.\n\nSimilarly, in the 1830s many women and men in America acted on their religious convictions and moral outrage to become a part of the abolitionist movement. Many women in particular responded to William Lloyd Garrison's invitation to become involved in the American Anti-Slavery Society. They were heavily involved, attending meetings and writing petitions. Arthur Tappan and other conservative members of the society objected to women engaging in politics publicly. \n\nGiven the perceived need for a society to campaign for anti-slavery worldwide, the British and Foreign Anti-Slavery Society (BFASS) was accordingly founded in 1839. One of its first significant deeds was to organize the World Anti-Slavery Convention in 1840: \"Our expectations, we confess, were high, and the reality did not disappoint them.\" The preparations for this event had begun in 1839, when the Society circulated an advertisement inviting delegates to participate in the convention. Over 200 of the official delegates were British. The next largest group was the Americans, with around 50 delegates. Only small numbers of delegates from other nations attended.\n\nThe circular message, distributed in 1839 provoked a controversial response from American opponents of slavery. The Garrisonian faction supported the participation of women in the anti-slavery movement. They were opposed by the supporters of Arthur and Lewis Tappan. When the latter group sent a message to the BFASS opposing the inclusion of women, a second circular was issued in February 1840 which explicitly stated that the meeting was limited to \"gentlemen\".\n\nDespite an earlier statement that women would not be admitted, many American and British female abolitionists, including Lucretia Mott, Elizabeth Cady Stanton and Lady Byron, appeared at the World Anti-Slavery Convention in London. Wendell Phillips proposed that female delegates should be admitted, and much of the first day of the convention was devoted to discussing whether they should be allowed to participate.Published reports from the convention noted \"The upper end and one side of the room were appropriated to ladies, of whom a considerable number were present, including several female abolitionist from the United States.\" The women were allowed to watch and listen from the spectators gallery but could not take part. \n\nBenjamin Robert Haydon painted \"The Anti-Slavery Society Convention, 1840\" a year after the event that today is in the National Portrait Gallery. This very large and detailed work shows Alexander as Treasurer of the new Society. The painting portrays the 1840 meeting and was completed the next year. The new society's mission was \"The universal extinction of slavery and the slave trade and the protection of the rights and interests of the enfranchised population in the British possessions and of all persons captured as slaves.\"\n\nThe convention's organising committee had asked the Reverend Benjamin Godwin to prepare a paper on the ethics of slavery. The convention unanimously accepted his paper which condemned not just slavery but also the world's religious leaders and every community who had failed to condemn the practise. The convention resolved to write to every religious leader to share this view. The convention called on every religious communities to eject any supporters of slavery from their midst.\n\nGeorge William Alexander reported on his visits in 1839, with James Whitehorn, to Sweden and the Netherlands to discuss the conditions of slaves in the Dutch colonies and in Suriname. In Suriname, he reported, there were over 100,000 slaves with an annual attrition rate of twenty per cent. The convention prepared open letters of protest to the respective sovereigns.\n\nJoseph Pease spoke and accused the British government of being complicit in the continuing existence of slavery in India.\n\nAfter leaving the convention on the first day, being denied full access to the proceedings, Lucretia Mott and Elizabeth Cady Stanton, \" walked home arm in arm, commenting on the incidents of the day, we resolved to hold a convention as soon as we returned home, and form a society to advocate the rights of women.\" Eight years later they did, hosting the Seneca Falls Convention in Seneca Falls, New York. \n\nOne hundred years later the Women's Centennial Congress was held in America to celebrate the progress that women had made since they were prevented from speaking at this conference.\n\n"}
